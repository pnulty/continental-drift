The first thing that you have to awknowledge is that everyone's food limitations are completely arbitrary cultural concepts.  So many North Americans would complain about the cruelty of eating dog, horse, or parrot while muching on pork, beef, or chicken.  I have arbitrarily chosen the distinction between the kingdom animalia and the others - for example, I would eat plants, mushrooms, yeast, etc.

Secondly, even meat eaters should be able to admit that eating meat causes suffering and death to the animal it came from...or heavily deny the nature of what meat is.  One has the option of choosing to accept the suffering and death as a part of the circle of life, but they should acknowledge that this is indeed a choice.  In a globalised society where food from around the planet is delivered fresh to your grocery store, a plant-based diet is completely possible.  If you live in an isolated area, you can eat local meat and canned food at best.  Where a plant based diet is available, then killing a cow is a choice.  I respect the right of meat eaters and vegetarians alike to make that choice, especially if they are conscious of it.

The ethics get very fuzzy if you talk about [talk](http://images.mmosite.com/news/2009/08/21/guildwars2/gw2s.jpg) [about](http://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/PlantPeople.jpeg) [sentient](http://images.epilogue.net/users/caramitten/harbinger_of_spring.jpg) [plants](http://dacarc.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/ents.jpg), or conversely, about animals with [no](http://hans.wyrdweb.eu/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/seasponge.jpg) [known](http://www.theacademylb.com/images/2009/03/deep_sea_tree_sponge.jpg) [nervous](http://www.sustainabilityninja.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/george-bush.jpg) [systems](http://www.vanityfair.com/images/politics/2009/08/sarah-palin-0908-02.jpg).  The concept of 'vegetarian' then merely means biased towards one form of life over another with no ethical justification.

Perhaps a new word should be coined for people who only eat food that did not grow with a central nervous system, and cannot perceive pain in any measurable way.  Dumbatarians?  Spongophiles?  Atreeists?

I hate (sometimes) the drawbacks of the small population such as the lack of career opportunities, or the poor selection available in shops. I don't whine much about the weather but the darkness of the winter does get depressing sometimes (it also makes one appreciate spring time a lot more).

3) Reykjavik's international airport is [Keflavik International Airport](http://www.kefairport.is/English/) which is clean and modern. It is pretty far from the city (about 50 kilometers) so getting to/from it takes time. Taking a taxi is very expensive but the bus is fairly cheap. The main airline is Icelandair which has a wide selection of destinations in Europe and North America (including Toronto but only during summer). Other airlines that fly to Reykjavik are Iceland Express, SAS, Delta and more.

4) Iceland was very expensive in most respect in an international comparison before the financial meltdown in 2008. After the currency collapsed, it became a lot more affordable for foreigners but is not what you would call cheap either. One thing that is consistently cheaper in Iceland than in most other countries is the price of electricity and heating. Home appliances and electronics are silly expensive and so is everything car related (but it doesn't stop us from being one of the most car-dependant nation on the planet).

___________________________________________________

Someone else asked this question recently so I am reposting the advice I gave them-

The EU has really dominated the last eleven or so years of my life. If you are committed about this venture, I promise it will open up new galaxies for you, both literally and figuratively. The depth of the individual philosophies of Jedi and Sith, the incredibly complex politics and military action surrounding the the Clone Wars, and especially the NJO; the movies don't even scratch the surface of what is truly Star Wars. Wow! Where to start.

The first thing you need to do is embrace the sequels. Not only am I saying you need to accept them, you need to embrace them before you can really start on the EU adventure. I will tell you later how to make them much more palatable.

Let's start at the beginning of time. The earliest chronology is catalogued, I believe, in graphic novels. I am talking about the ones that feature the Sith carrying swords made of force enhanced metal rather than energy. These cover the earliest battles between the Jedi and Sith with a lot of cool visual accompaniment. There are some nice Star Wars Omnibus compilations that came out recently which include all of these Jedi vs. Sith battles in a small, thick, graphic medium. These will help to reignite your interest in the mystery of the force.

Then you are going to want to move on to KOTOR. KOTOR is not only one of the greatest video games of all time, it is a primary source for a lot of galactic history. You get to learn about the rakatans etc. KOTOR 2 is optional. It has no real canonical relevance but its worth the play through just to hear what Kreia has to say.

On to the Darth Bane books. These are, in my opinion, the best additions to the EU. Drew Karpyshyn is second only to James Luceno when it comes to writing Star Wars books. The Bane books will reconfigure your outlook on Star Wars as a whole. You will completely forget that this is the same universe the fat bastard Lucas claims is supposedly ""for children"". The Bane books are seriously dark, gripping, and provide insights into the force and the life of a Sith that will blow your mind. I can't stress enough how important it is to drink these in as you will spend the next several dozen books reading about the boring, predictable, and often downright asinine Luke Skywalker who can't pick his nose without help from Obi-Wan's blue glowie form.

After the Bane books start in with some Episode 1 buildup novels and comics, specifically the ones that introduce the pure awesomeness that is Darth Maul. The books you will want to read here are Darth Maul: Saboteur and Darth Maul: Shadow Hunter. These two books will simultaneously give you a deeper feel for Maul as well as introduce some of the ground work for the Sith backed invasion of Naboo. If you want even more context on motivations and setup for the Trade Federation's blockade you can also go for Cloak of Deception. Its a bit boring but not all Star Wars things can be amazing can they? You should also read a 4 issue comic series from Dark Horse simply called Darth Maul. This beautifully drawn series tells the story of how Darth Maul singlehandedly takes down the entire Black Sun crime syndicate.

Episode 1 happens, we all die a little bit inside. Some novels happen concerning the apprenticeship of young Anakin but they all consist of him doing stupid unimportant shit to as he puts it, ""test the limits of Obi-Wan's love"". There is one good book called The Approaching Storm that sets the stage really well for Episode 2 but it is boring as hell and I had to come back to it several times before completion.

Episode 2 happens, now we are in business! After Episode 2 there comes a hurricane of novels and comics, almost all of which I would heartily recommend. You may disapprove of the movie that started it, but the EU work that came out of the Wars themselves really helped define Star Wars and flesh out the main characters tremendously.

**WARNING!!! Nothing containing Ahsoka Tano is canon. Period. Lucas himself and all his corporate might would disagree with me on this, and they would all be equally wrong. Anakin never had an apprentice and never will have had one.** If you must see the animated series or the animated movie, then simply pretend the events took place without Ahsoka in them. Assume that Anakin was responsible for all of it. I have, like a good little obedient Star Wars fan, bent over and taken a LOT from George Lucas. Ahsoka Tano is where I draw the line.

If you want to go bare bones with the Clone Wars reading, the musts are:
Cestus Deception - Great interaction between Jedi and Clone Commandos during a dangerous operation, outlining the value of individual Clone troopers in spite of their cattle like origins.

Shatterpoint - Mace Windu FUCKING SHIT UP in one of the best written Star Wars books of all time.

Jedi Trial - This is crucial because it tells the story of Anakin's final mission as a padawan and his knighting at the end. It also sets the tone for his internal darkness to follow. It is also written mostly by a Vietnam veteran with a giant beard. You can really tell from the writing.

Labyrinth of Evil - This is the book that takes you step by step all the way up to the the first scene in Episode 3. It is a superb book (by my favorite Star Wars author James Luceno) detailing the camaraderie and devotion between Anakin and Obi-Wan as they chase down a lead on the identity of Darth Sidious. The last page of the book is Anakin and Obi-Wan launching to save the Chancellor (the first scene in Epi 3).

Episode 3 happens. The only must between Episodes 3 and 4 is Dark Lord: Rise of Darth Vader. Another superbly written book by James Luceno that is written from Vader's perspective as he hunts down Jedi and comes to terms with his new robotic self.

Episode 4,5,6 happen. After this, its just books and comics. You are probably anxious to get to the NJO, as anyone would be, and so I will just make a short list of the mandatory ones - 

Everything with the name ""Thrawn"" anywhere near the title. This includes the Thrawn Trilogy and then the Hand of Thrawn duology which follows ten Star Wars years later. If you need a reason for this, just google Thrawn.

The Jedi Academy trilogy. Introduces extremely important characters.

Darksaber. There is a lot of controversy and bullshit surrounding the topic of ""who created the Death Star"". (Some Clues: It wasn't Raith Sienar despite all his technical genius, it wasn't the fucking insects on Geonosis, and it CERTAINLY wasn't Moff Jerjerrod) Each of these people played parts in the conceptualization of the Death Star, but only one person made it a reality and this book sorts it.

The fact that so many books still name the Beatles ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success: the Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worth of being saved.

In a sense the Beatles are emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole: too much attention to commercial phenomena (be it grunge or U2) and too little attention to the merits of real musicians. If somebody composes the most divine music but no major label picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of rock critics will ignore him. If a major label picks up a musician who is as stereotyped as one can be but launches her or him worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on her or him. This is the sad status of rock criticism: rock critics are basically publicists working for free for major labels, distributors and record stores. They simply publicize what the music business wants to make money with.

Hopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great musician like Tim Buckley, who never sold much, and commercial products like the Beatles. And rock critics will study more of rock history and realize who invented what and who simply exploited it commercially.

Beatles' ""aryan"" music removed any trace of black music from rock and roll: it replaced syncopated african rhythm with linear western melody, and lusty negro attitudes with cute white-kid smiles.

Contemporary musicians never spoke highly of the Beatles, and for a good reason. They could not figure out why the Beatles' songs should be regarded more highly than their own. They knew that the Beatles were simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon (thanks to ""Beatlemania"", which had nothing to do with their musical merits). THat phenomenon kept alive interest in their (mediocre) musical endeavours to this day. Nothing else grants the Beatles more attention than, say, the Kinks or the Rolling Stones. There was nothing intrinsically better in the Beatles' music. Ray Davies of the Kinks was certainly a far better songwriter than Lennon &amp; McCartney. The Stones were certainly much more skilled musicians than the 'Fab Fours'. And Pete Townshend was a far more accomplished composer, capable of ""Tommy"" and ""Quadrophenia"". Not to mention later and far greater British musicians. Not to mention the American musicians who created what the Beatles later sold to the masses.

The Beatles sold a lot of records not because they were the greatest musicians but simply because their music was easy to sell to the masses: it had no difficult content, it had no technical innovations, it had no creative depth. They wrote a bunch of catchy 3-minute ditties and they were photogenic. If somebody had not invented ""beatlemania"" in 1963, you would not have wasted five minutes of your time to read a page about such a trivial band.
Note of 2010. The Beatles were not a terribly interesting band, but their fans were and still are an interesting phenomenon. I can only name religious fundamentalists as annoying (and as threatening) as Beatles fans and as persevering in sabotaging anyone who dares express an alternative opinion on their faith. They have turned me into some kind of Internet celebrity not because of the 6,000 bios that i have written, not because of the 800-page book that i published, not because of 30 years of cultural events that i organized, but simply because i downplayed the artistic merits of the Beatles, an action that they seem to consider as disgraceful as the 2001 terrorist attacks. 

-Piero Scaruffi

I won't say that I don't love the Beatles music, and I don't argue against their role in changing the course of music, but I would argue that they changed it for the worst.

Genuine Buddy and Kymco People are also in this performance class, they will have slightly lower build quality but save you $1K or more on MSRP. I'd also say the Kymco 200cc models -- the Like 200i and the People S 200 -- are in this class, and might be a better choice for your size.

OPINION ON

Vespas are great if you have a passionate, conscientious shop that keeps parts in stock. If not, expect repairs to take 2-6 weeks ""while the parts come from Italy"". By boat, apparently.

Hondas will be sold through Honda powersports dealers, which (like Vespa dealers) will be friendly or not friendly. Only difference is that Honda has a real parts network in the US and it would be unusual for any part to take more than 2-3 days to get there. However, Honda dealers are also well-known for treating scooter owners like crap. I run the Honda Helix discussion list, and I hear many unfortunate stories. But it's likely their SH150i support is much better than their Helix support. Maybe.

Genuine is incredibly intense about their dealer network and customer experience, everybody I've heard of with a Genuine (aka PGO) product just raves about it. Statistically, I think they're probably a little less reliable than Vespas or Hondas, but I also think you'll get better service when there is a problem.

Kymco, like Vespa, depends on the strength of the shop and its mechanics. I've heard a few bad stories by unsatisfied customers, but a hell of a lot more good ones. For example, Kym Cojones... err, I mean [Kymco Jones](http://kymcojones.blogspot.com/)... had a blown head on a People 250 that he bought used, under the original non-transferable warranty. When the shop described the problem to Kymco's NA distributors, they shipped him a new head assembly for free.

Just a loose collection of hippies, spreading the 'acid gospel'. They're probably most famous for their initiation 'ritual', which involved doing a thumbprint. This is where you dipped your thumb into a vial of crystal LSD, taking 2-10 **milli**grams (or multiple sheets of med strength L) at once. 

There were many reasons for this. It meant you had to rely on the Family to look after you for a week as you tripped non-stop. This showed you had faith in them to look after you, and in what they taught you to keep your sanity. It also 'burned off bad karma', as you were 'born again', post trip. There was o way a cop would ever expose theselves to this, so it was also a way to weed out the cops from the higher-side of the drug culture. You also weren't allowed access to certain people or quantities of the drug without doing a thumbprint, as until that pont, they didn't know if they could trust you.

There was all the social change of the 60's, but also the discovery of DNA, computer programming, chaos and quantum mathematics, the idea behind cloud computing, the imagery of fractals (which are way more than just pretty pictures), and much more. It had a (sometimes quiet) role in almost every scientific, mathematical, and psychological breakthrough for decades. I told you I'm a geek. 

Also, don't let the modern revisionists color what skinhead was at the beginning for you. I'm not saying they are, or you believe the wrong thing, just that there is a lot of wrong information being passed around these days. The black rudeboys and skins got along with the white skins, but they both went paki-bashing like they were getting paid for it, and a lot of them followed [Enoch Powell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enoch_Powell). They may have gotten along for the most part before the Nazi's co-opted the subculture, and some were all about the music and dancing (and not politics), but they were still a violent subculture who liked to drink and fight, and their common enemies were usually illegal immigrants they thought threatened their jobs. When the Neo-Nazi and nationalist movements started in England, it spread like wildfire. Some of the largest of these organizations are still American, but the most violent and outspoken tend to all be European, especially English, Russian, German, and Scandinavian. When you have centuries of monoculture, racism and nationalism are almost a given. Same goes for the modern European RASH and ARA/Anti-Fa groups. There have been some brutal clashes between nationalist groups and ARA/Anti-Fa in Germany and Russia in particular.

If you're really interested in the skinhead subculture, you should look into the Australian [Sharpies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpies). [They](http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090915015510/http://www.blackburnsouthsharps.com/1024x768/index.htm) were skinheads in Aus, before Aus ever had skinheads, and were much more aligned with the authentic English/Jamaican skinheads/rudeboys/baldies than some people would have you believe. A lot of the older Aus heads still look at the Sharpies fondly. They lived to drink and fight and go to shows, and they were what a lot of Aus skins modeled themselves after.",1426733385,,c1ezu21,2,IAmA,0,lol_Taco,True,t3_fc7py,

Yes, one significant difference between the South and the North in the US are unions and labor protection laws, and the result are much lower wages in the South. Of course the South attracts manufacturing under those conditions -- so does Asia.

What I'm saying is that turning the North into the South is probably not the best way to go. In most societies, the overall reduction of take-home pay is not considered to be a sensible long term strategy to increase the standard of living -- turning low skilled labor into high skilled labor is.

On a financial - investment - side you have to contend with , depending on which part of the world you are in :-

1) a lack of understanding of the technology .

2) a lack of understanding of the business - a very narrow view of business .

3) inappropriate investment \ wastage . Inappropriate staffing .

4) not understanding creativity , not understanding bottom up . Trying to be too controlling but , at the same time , not managing appropriately .

5) not understanding the overall business cycle - the ~80 year cycle . Not sufficiently understanding people and life .

6) not understanding and adhering to basic business principles - Business 101 .

7) lack of strategy on both a company and an industry side . 

8) not investing in the long term - building in a lot of downstream costs .

9) an inability to deal with indefiniteness - eliminating - removing - all the indefiniteness and , thus , destroying the business . Rather than creating , evolving and growing the business . Hollywood , of recent years , a classic example .

10) making poor judgements . jumping to wrong conclusions . Poorly perceiving reality .

On a technical side :-

1) poorly thought out , poorly architectured design . This greatly limits the technical ability \ technical power of the design and it builds in unnecessary and expensive downstream costs .

2) lack of implementing business concerns in the technical design - lack of designing as an asset and marketing as a commodity .

Fields - my own - software engineering - certainly has a lot of opportunities but mainly from 2 points of view :-

1) that things are often being done wrong - wrong business models , wrong cost and pricing structures .

2) there is a lot of room for a lot of good creativity but the field tends to be rather conservative - unlike what it was in the 70's - but I do think that that is changing massively - ie. get ready to ride the wave .

Obstacles :-

1) remote working is a very good way to go but many companies have an inability managerial culture wise to accommodate it .

2) costs - always a massive problem - and offshoring is not the solution .

3) regulatory &amp; tax structures , particularly in many EU countries , can strongly work against establishing and running small businesses .

4) morality - is always a concern but usually has to be handled on a per issue \ situation basis .

Culture :-

1) there is a general issue of people just not thinking things through properly . Part of this may be the general mentality at this part of the economic cycle which has produced a very narrow approach , and a 'don't stick your head above the parapet' approach .

2) there are many cultural problems - many changes over the last 35 years in the business and general culture that have produced a lot of negativities and associated problems . The cycle is at the bottom and is swinging up so things , hopefully , will change and recover .

3) there is a widespread inability to handle responsibility .

4) there is a lack of understanding of truths , pursuance of truths and common adoption of greater and superior truths .

In all this it's often not a case of black and white . A company's success is dependent on how much they get right and how much they are better than their competition . You can have large concerns wasting massive amounts of money and doing all sorts of stupid things but at the same time still making a profit . You can have small and medium concerns burning through investment and income capital over many years , often making a small profit or continuously making a loss .

Companies that are going sour are usually , especially if they are large concerns , going sour for many years - the problems are endemic within the companies .

We had no plan and no reservations, we ended up there and loved it so much we stayed for a week. The salesman are SMOOOOOTH. Not the same kind of pressure you might expect, but they will show you around town for an hour or so, then you are pretty much obligated to visit their shop. Once there, you never experience pressure to buy, you're either going to spend hundreds or thousands of $ on a rug, or you're not. When we were there before, we met a shop owner who wanted US dollars and in exchange he'd pay for everything and drive us around, it was great, like a personal tour guide. He took us out of the tourist area and showed us *real* Istanbul, it was awesome. I always checked his conversions and he never seemed to rip us off, just wanted the US dollars. Back then $15 was 20,000,000 TL (yes TWENTY MILLION) and getting worse every day so it was worth it to him to get the USDs. I feel like back then Istanbul was a little off the beaten path, things were cheap and it was more geared toward backpackers. This last visit was much different, a little more expensive, more upscale, reminded me a bit of Paris (but not quite that Western or pricey). The food was great, the people were friendly and I highly recommend it as a MUST SEE. We took a taxi out of the main area then walked around the back streets. This time it was me, my wife, her dad and our 3-year-old son. I could have spent weeks in that city, there are so many amazing sights. We flew Turkish Air. Great food on the plane, and at 6'6"" I had more leg room than usual.

No, Cuba was always able to buy whatever it wanted on the world market. . The only other thing the US could have done was to retard capital investment into Cuba -- but Cuba sort of precluded that option by nationalizing all of the capital already in the country, so it's a moot point.  Nowadays, I understand that there are a handful of European consortiums investing in Cuban resorts and 'resorts' (cathouses), but that doesn't constitute a major investment in the country.

Increased risk of narcolepsy observed among children and adolescents vaccinated with PandemrixR

1 Feb 2011

Among those 4-19 years of age who received Pandemrix®-vaccine had a manifold increased risk of falling ill with narcolepsy during the 8 months following vaccination in comparison to those unvaccinated in the same age group. Based on the evaluation done so far, the National Narcolepsy Task Force finds it probable that Pandemrix®-vaccination contributed to the observed increase in incidence of narcolepsy among those 4 -19 years of age. Currently, the most likely explanation is that the increase in narcolepsy is by joint effect of the vaccine and some other factor(s). At the moment, there is no evidence that the increase in narcolepsy observed in Finland could be attributed to the vaccine lots used. The results can be read in the Interim Report of the Task Force which is published on February 1st, 2011.

The association of Pandemrix-vaccination and narcolepsy was studied using extensive registry based data. Data gathered from hospital discharge registries on patients fallen ill with narcolepsy during years 2009-10 was linked with data from primary care records on pandemic vaccination. The observed association is so evident that it is unlikely that other so-called confounding factors could fully explain the phenomenon.

In Finland during years 2009–10, 60 children and adolescents aged 4-19 years fell ill with narcolepsy. These figures base on data from hospitals and primary care, and the review of individual patient records by a panel of neurologists and sleep researchers. Of those fallen ill, 52 (almost 90 percent) had received Pandemrix® vaccine, while the vaccine coverage in the entire age group was 70 percent. Based on the preliminary analyses, the risk of falling ill with narcolepsy among those vaccinated in the 4-19 years age group was 9-fold in comparison to those unvaccinated in the same age group. This increase was most pronounced among those 5–15 years of age. No cases were observed among those under 4 years of age. Also, no increase in cases of narcolepsy or signs of vaccination impacting risk of falling ill with narcolepsy was observed among those above 19 years of age.

In addition to Finland, increase in cases of narcolepsy observed only in Sweden and Iceland 

In 2009, among countries using similar pandemic vaccine as was used in Finland, an increase in cases of narcolepsy has been observed only in Finland, Sweden and Iceland. Contrary to the observations in Finland, narcolepsy has occurred in greater numbers than expected also among unvaccinated children and teenagers in Iceland.

The association between narcolepsy and PandemrixR vaccine requires more investigations

During the coming months, these preliminary register based results will be confirmed in Finland.  In further investigations, special attention will be given to infections and other stimuli in close time association with the pandemic vaccination. The significance of the possible joint effects will be explored.

In addition, other significant co-factors contributing to the onset of narcolepsy will be evaluated in epidemiologic, immunologic and genetic studies planned. The main aim of the immunologic studies is to clarify, whether the immunological responses to the different components of the Pandemrix® vaccine and to the A(H1N1) virus among those children and teenagers with genetic disposition to narcolepsy and those fallen ill with narcolepsy differ from the immunological responses of other children and teenagers not belonging to these risk groups.

It is also of utmost importance to find out whether the association is observed also elsewhere than in Finland. At present, Finland is participating in the ECDC contracted, VAESO led narcolepsy background incidence and case control studies which are being conducted in 9 European Union countries by pharmacovigilance researchers from Public Health Institutes, Regulatory Agencies and Universities. These studies will evaluate the contribution of the pandemic vaccines and other risk factors in the onset of narcolepsy, and confirm whether increase in incidence in narcolepsy is seen in other countries. The outcomes of these studies will be reported during early summer 2011.

By January 24, 2011, 56 notifications of narcolepsy in association with Pandemrix® vaccination have been received by the National Vaccine Adverse Events Register maintained at the National Institute of Health and Welfare in Finland. Of these, 54 cases belonged to the age group of 4–19 years. Among most of the notified cases, the onset of symptoms of narcolepsy had started approximately two months following Pandemrix® vaccination.

The final report from the National Narcolepsy Task Force will be released by 31st August 2011.

&gt; But let's say it isn't. Why don't then Israel unconditionally (in order to skip all cock-blocking from Palestinian despots), allow the creation of Palestinian state as a sign of good will?

First, within *which* borders? Second, we unconditionally withdrew from Gaza as a sign of good will. What we got in exchange was a criminal organization of islamic fundamentalists establishing a militant stronghold that is unaccountable to international law and routinely engages in unprovoked, deliberate murder of Israeli citizens. Third, in which way are *we* blocking the creation of a Palestinian state? What say do we have in its creation?

I really hate the house analogy because it often misrepresents the cause of effect. Here's how it looks according to zionists:

Jews live in a house (a territory that will be later renamed to Palestine). Jews leave or are expelled from it, and the remaining ones are perpetually subjugated and raped, for generations, by various invaders, until only a thin trace remains. The house is settled by generations of different people. Meanwhile jews, being hanged in Europe, return to the house and take an unoccupied room. Some of the tenants sell their rooms to the Jews and then tell the other tenants that the Jews stole their room. The rest of tenants, offended at the Jews' gall skin color, construct an elaborate fantasy of a Jewish plot to set the house on fire, and with it in hand erect nooses outside and start hanging the Jews one by one. Jews sneak in guns, chase out the hostile tenants, renovate the entire house, put in bulletproof glasses and machine gun nests on the roof, and try living their life in solitude.

The tenants, having their vile approach blow up on their face, call the cops.

Absolutely -- but remember that the U.S. also supported, for better or worse, the Shah for many years in the interests of ""stability"", along with some pretty questionable regimes that were worse than Mubarak's.  Stability is good, but if don't manage to strike a reasonable balance between your _realpolitik_ and the image that the U.S. needs to project (e.g. peace, freedom, yada yada) in order for it to have any credibility, then people will get angry and you lose out.

2. Not always true. You can choose not to have treatment, and you can also choose not to have defense from invaders. You do have autonomy over your own body. You can choose not to have military. You also can't really choose not to have disease. Your distinctions are completely irrelevant.
3. Your argument assumes, that national defense will be the perfect solution and save everyone's lives. My argument is not any illogical than the argument for national defense. Your other arguments are irrational because not only are the irrelevant to my example, but it is hypothetical that do not necessarily have to be true. I think you need to be less hasty about your assumptions that health care would ruin your life. It would actually help you, especially if you were sick.
4. Germs can kill people just like terrorists, just not in a public explosion, more like in a pandemic or epidemic, and it has the potential to be more deadly than terrorism, and more likely to kill you. Freedom for government intervention is only important if you are alive. Health insurance is not protecting us from usual social factors, but it can, for example, if you are injured severely by other humans--on top of that it protects you from non-social actors, like disease, viruses, and bacteria. The distinction between terrorist and disease/viruses/bacteria is minuscule, the difference is that the terrorist is less dangerous and less likely to cause your death in terms of probability.
5. Proper health care also deters the spread of disease wider, faster, farther. The US already pays a lot of tax payer money for health care, increasing coverage for everyone won't hurt us as much as you think. Yes health care is heavily debated, because insurance companies want you to heavily debate it---had there been private armies, they'd want you to debate national defense all the time--but they don't exist in America. The same quality and competitiveness can be assessed of the national defense. 


Point is, you are still ignoring the similarities of the two situations, national defense and national health care, based on confirmation bias and the simple fact that you don't like the idea of national health care, because you are more afraid of taxes than the possibility of death (mainly because you are currently temporarily, healthy). It's been instilled in you since your childhood. If you had lived in Europe, you'd be thinking the opposite.

* **Bring entertainment with you.** Magazines, books, a MP3 player with audio books or plenty of music, and/or a laptop (given outlet availability in the train compartments). My guideline was 1 book for every 10 hours of travel (then again, I'm a fast reader)

* **Food and drinks**. Especially the latter is important. At least the trains I use to travel with have somewhat annoying air conditioning/heating, which leaves the air pretty dry and you dehydrated in the long run. Keep food rather minimal - sandwiches, non-crumbling snacks, and, *as someone else commented* earlier on: **preferably something that does not smell!**
* Blankets and pillows are not a must; A small pillow is the only thing I recommend, really. A **jacket** can make a good blanket substitute IMO; a rolled up pullover is a good makeshift pillow as well. 
* **Get up and move around once in a while.** Unless you travel first class, conditions are relatively cramped and depending on your physical size (both in circumference and height, that is), your legs and butt are going to ache after a few hours. Basically, heed the same thought as on long haul flights, just even more often.

We shall now see - after wading through your ranty, bloviated rhetoric - that you are, in fact, very confused and ignorant on this subject.

&gt; ""The European Wind Energy Association has set a target for European wind energy for 2010 of 180 GW...""

You provide no cite for this claim - and Googling it shows it appears only on one abandoned blog and one anti-renewable energy blog.

&gt; ...however the world average is less than 20%. 

You provide no cite for this claim. Regardless, large, modern turbines are usually in the range I stated: 30 to 45%.

&gt; No, wind turbines are NOT competitive with mainstream forms of energy creation...

[Wind power cuts your electricity bills.](http://www.350resources.org.uk/2010/07/25/all-power-to-the-wind-%E2%80%93-it-cuts-your-electricity-bills/) This is why wind energy is seeing massive growth all over the planet. If you were correct, it would not be happening. Who do we trust? Reality or some random internet expert? It's not a difficult choice for any rational person.

&gt; What you are saying, that wind turbines are competitive (in any economic or energy output sense) is a complete utter lie. 

You're demonstrating all the hysteria of the typical zealot whose beliefs do not match reality.

&gt; They are being deployed because people fall for PR and marketing propaganda and because they are extremely subsidized...

Ignorant, wingnut nonsense. See link above - and consider that China is deploying wind at a *massive* rate. Did they ""fall for PR and marketing propaganda""? lol.

You've become very hysterical about nameplate capacity versus actual output. It's not a secret that wind turbines have a capacity factor. You've not exposed some massive conspiracy! Wind energy continues to be deployed at a massive rate despite this capacity factor.

&gt; Don't forget that your actual capacity is far less, because of the distance from wind turbines to the transformer and from the transformer to the substation and from the substations to the grid 

How much energy is lost as a result? How does it compare to other electricity generators? Provide credible cite. 

&gt; Hydro makes up 87.16% of the renewable energy...

Yes, hydro is the low-hanging fruit - that doesn't alter the trend of massive deployment of wind energy and future plans of 150GW wind by 2020 in China. And ""41% of all energy installations in the next 20 years will be wind"" for Europe. Once again, reality and credible analysis does not match your beliefs.

&gt; The growth of wind power by 30 fold makes absolutely no difference to the actual output...

lol. Sure. Whatever you say.

&gt; ...they only have 25.8 GW of wind at absolute capacity...

What is ""absolute capacity""? This is not terminology used to describe electricity production. You appear to be making things up as you go along.

And where did you get that number? Provide a cite. Your evidence-free claims are not persuasive. Similarly all your other claims that I've snipped out because you offer no evidence.

&gt; 1 GW nuclear powerplant would be one built in the 70s/80s. 

Anyone can skim http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_reactors and see that I am right and you are talking nonsense.

&gt; You are comparing 30-40 year old nuclear technology to 2030 wind turbines technology. 

Clearly your first claim is false. Your second: ""2030 wind turbines""? Just more evidence-free nonsense.

&gt; ...you really should compare it to the newest nuclear energy plants and their output, which is even higher in output and more efficient.

Clearly flawed logic. We should compare lifecycle of each. Not cherry pick examples that have only been running a short time.

&gt; Complete lie... 

No, it is not a lie to say that new nukes take 10+ years to deploy. See Olkiluoto, Finland and Flamanville, France for two examples.

&gt; ...Modern nuclear power plants are planned for construction in four years or less ...

You believe the sales literature from nuclear corporations?! There's one born every minute! Try looking at reality to see... reality. They said the Finnish reactor would be complete in 7 years - they're up to 13 years now.

&gt; It really shows the truth regarding your statements...

You've failed to show anything I have produced is not true and provided ample evidene that you cannot separate nuclear propagnada from reality.

&gt; I am sorry to say but it seems like you have been fooled by bad math and pro-wind propaganda.

You have failed to prove either accusation.

&gt; If you assume i am against wind, why would you think I would want to sell wind energy? 

Your reading comprehension is very poor - this explains much! I said that ""you've either been fooled by anti-wind propaganda or you're trying to sell it"" - trying to sell the anti-wind propaganda... not wind! 

&gt; I am not anti-wind energy; ... As it is now, wind turbines are a scam.

Your point and mine are not mutually exclusive.

NPR was reporting this morning that protests have taken an anti-American turn, equating Mubarak with American interests in the region. I don't think it's very likely, but if opposition leaders take power in the region, the U.S. will want to be on friendly terms with the new government.

It actually might be, not because of these specific actions, but because it could be against anti-Trust laws. In general, it is illegal for a monopoly to use their monopoly status to give them unfair leverage in a separate market. Microsoft has a documented monopoly on desktop operating systems.

A while ago, they were taken to court for using this monopoly to [leverage themselves into the browser market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft). Microsoft argued that an internet browser was an essential part of the operating system now, and so it couldn't really be considered a separate market. After an initial ruling against Microsoft an appeal reduced the severity of the conviction, but it still stood that Microsoft was in violation. In Europe, a similar suit was brought, and Microsoft also lost there.

If Microsoft is using the Suggested Sites feature, which is built into their browser, they will be using their monopoly on desktop operating systems to leverage themselves into the browser market, which they are then using to gather data that leverages themselves into the search market. If it's just the Bing search toolbar, then it's not illegal because that would be them using their Search customer base to help their Search line of business, so there is no use of the desktop monopoly involved.",1426734033,,c1f1810,-7,programming,0,Fjordo,False,t3_fd3g9,

That's not their position.

""More often"" .. voila .. a nuanced statement. Come on, we believe in you. You can do this!

Where do you get the idea that liberals want to impose their beliefs?

&gt;But at least conservatives don't pretend that all ""the people"" agree with them because of a ""collective will"".

They don't? What do you call it when you see somebody taking their own personal morals and attaching them to your country's flag?

It sure as hell isn't true for all conservatives. But if there is one party in the world (not just american) that is famous for claiming their morals represent the people, the nation and everything in between, it would be the republicans.

But you seem to still miss the point, that is actually relevant here. You trolled on a non partisian post, to invoke a discussion, so you can spew your lies, generalisations and inane remarks about topics you find interesting. When you are called out on it, you go back and forward between calling it jokes, and then being dead serious on how big of a generalising biggot you are.

I'm not even an American. I don't give a shit about your partisian rethorics. But please stop raping terms like liberal, libertine, conservative, socialist. You appearantly don't know what they mean. And maybe your generalisations about the people that 'use' these terms to label themselves in the states, is spot on. I doubt it. But the world is bigger than that.

Liberals, are about maximizing personal freedom. It comes from the latin word 'liber', which means freedom. In Europe liberal parties are considered right-wing. The socialists are on the left. They tend to put collective welfare above individual welfare, from a historic perspective. But in reality none of this gets even near human rights violating. 

What you would call 'conservatives' is what in Europe is called 'fascism'. Nationalism, racism, religion, police-state, etc. 

So, why the fuck do keep calling liberals socialists. They are not. You may have socialist in America. They may vote for liberal candidates. 

But to even suggest that a liberal would be in favor of censorship. It doesn't make any sense. It never will. You are troll looking for a meaningless debate. And guess, what? I've have the patience.

But if you're interested in picking something that has more than speculation behind it, I have a suggestion.

The known exoplanets are all too big for humans to survive on the surface, even in suits.  Even the smallest is around 10 times the mass of Earth, so you'd weigh thousands of pounds on the surface.  Mining any of those known planets would be tough, even for automated systems - especially since the larger ones are probably gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn.

However, you could consider picking one of the Jupiter-sized exoplanets and postulating moons around them - after all, in our solar system most planets have moons, and the gas giants have a lot of them.  The moons would be more conducive to mining.

Detecting moons around a giant planet is way beyond our current capabilities, so it's likely to be a long time before the reality about the moons of these planets is known.  

By comparison, Alpha &amp; Proxima Centauri are the closest stars to us, and it may not be that long before we're able to either detect or rule out planets there.  Your book would then become either prescient or outdated.  ;)

Lets look at some facts though, take the UK,which within the EU was/is the largest market in Europe for mortgage backed securities in 2001 (and onward).

In short, yes MBS's were based on mortgages all over the world, the vast majority (in terms of numbers and value) were from the US, (hell, all EU MBS's were worth around 1/10th of those issued in the US by 2005), US MBS's were of a lower quality and, US lending was utterly reckless, hence the bloody repossession and bankruptcy rate.

**Why the lack of clarity? Didn't the Nazis keep meticulous lists?**

&gt; Actually, in most cases they didn't. Most German Jews were registered, but not all; to a limited degree this was also true in other Western Europe countries. Almost none of the Jews shot in the territories conquered from the Soviet Union were registered; Jews who perished from starvation or epidemics in all but the largest ghettoes were not listed; individual Jews hunted down in fields and forests were not recorded; and most significantly, the millions of Jews who were simply pushed off trains and into gas chambers, in most cases, were not listed. Not by the Nazis, that is. Then again, many Jews were listed in pre-war documents, or were recorded at one point or another during the war, perhaps by ghetto authorities, or other organizations; after the liberation various projects counted survivors. Many of these lists can be found on this website, at the Shoah Related List Database.

The issue of 'interracial' marriage was primarily about race - these are otoh issues of sexual freedom.

I don't know what the 'public opinion' is on such questions in the US - but in many european countries, not getting married at all, even with kids, is quite common.

I found the cheapest flight at 700 from Chicago (where I live) to Milan using StudentUniverse.com. It's usually the cheapest, although not always, and has nothing to do with being a student. Orbitz rates are 700-750. I chose Milan because it's a great airport for using jetblue or ryanair, as well as being in a Eurail region that touches France and Germany, making trains cheap for non-europeans if you get the pass. 

The regional Eurail pass is 170 and lets you go to France and Germany and possible Spain (?), bringing us to 700 + 170 = 870 for all travel expenses. I personally would buy a 1 country pass and go from Milan to Paris, which is only 45 dollars and can be used on high speed trains (saving about 100 dollars). But I like to spend time exploring one place, not tour the sights. Passes can be used for multiple countries, though you're limited in time and number of trains you can ride, which isn't really an issue over 12 days.

If you're traveling from the east coast, say JFK, the plane ticket drops about 100 dollars. West coast it goes up about 50. So we'll stick with the middle, Chicago.

I'm saying you stay for 12 nights, a total of 14 days with travel. That's about the average length of a stay. Average cost according to Hostel International (best site ever) is 20/night for a *dorm bed*. Alternatively you can just ask if they have open rooms that night. I got a single for 15 euros, which is around 40 dollars cheaper than it should be. That tactic's good if you're staying over the weekend since it goes up to around 30, although you can still find them for 20 if you shop around. Yeah, I know, it's a dorm with *other people*! Sound uncomfortable? Sometimes, but you meet so many more people and you almost always get a free breakfast, which right there saves 7-10 dollars per day if you were to go out to a restaurant.

12 x 20 is 240, plus 870, 1110. Eleven hundred dollars for all travel and living, minus food. When I was abroad I spent an average of 7-10 euros/day on food, about 12-15 dollars at the time. It would be less now. I bought lunchmeat and bread, only drank when other people were buying (they knew I was poor), and ate more than I have ever eaten before during the free breakfasts. This was in Paris, where it costs no less than 20 dollars to eat at a restaurant. I did splurge twice to try authentic French cliche dishes (French onion soup, snails, etc.)

15 x 13 (half a day on the first and last days b/c of travel) is another ~200. That's $1310 *total*, without museum entry or anything else. Most cities have a day where you can get into a museum for free (even the Louvre) or you can get group discounts. I didn't see many museums because of my budget and I don't really care for art.

Obviously, though, most people wouldn't want to live on bread and lunchmeat. I'm still going to say no real restaurants (most of them are tourist traps anyway), only little shops or kabob places. That'll double your food costs most likely, adding another 100-150 to the price. Still not much.

Anyway, there you go. 1310 for one person, 12 days in Europe. That's $55 out of each paycheck. [edit: per year. And don't forget tax returns!]

**Education** is not governed by the EU, and neither is by the US Federal Government IIRC. It is however VERY similar across the EU. Any EU citizen can go to school/study anywhere in the EU. **Social security** is still a responsibility of individual nations. **Judicial system** - the EU has courts, including equivalent to supreme court in the US. It deals with EU law, just like federal courts deal with federal law in the US. **Agricultural policies** are entirely handed over to the EU and states have absolutely no power over agricultural policies.

One more important thing: the EU doesn't have any tax.

Yes, your point that about covering the drastically larger area is valid. But I am arguing that since Americans their cars so much, the road funding should vastly exceed that of Europe combined. So, instead of 5% of taxes going to infrastructure, make it 10% or 15%.

They don't necessarily agree politically, but they band together under the same label and coexist, often uneasily, bound together by their opposition to the regime in power.

When such movements take power, this often results in a tension between the two factions. In Iran, the radicals won and purged the moderates.

&gt;Not exactly a military, but there is to a certain extent: EU NAVFOR, EULEX, Battlecorps, etc.

Member states contribute to those bodies. They don't represent the whole. For example, separate states can send extra troops to Iraq at their discretion, outside of EU military bodies. The point being that the success or failure of an EU military body doesn't necessarily affect the success or failure of Bulgaria. 


&gt;Education


Tends to be socialistic in each European countries. With the expensive prices of U.S. universities, the national gov deals with government-backed loans, the likes of which Europe will thankfully never have to know. 




&gt;Judicial system

You're right, it only deal with EU law not national law -- and as such only the treaties between countries. There is no comparison to the U.S. system. EU member states still hold sovereignty.

Fair point. Didn't know that!

It's also easy to say ""Oh, let's increase the percentage of money we use"", but at what expense? Shall we stop funding university loans? Shall we do away with food vouchers? (Shit, it would be nice to downsize the military....but there you have it. :( )

They're a small nation that has taken a large number of refugees and immigrants in the past thirty years, and they haven't all integrated very well. This has created some anti-immigration feelings among Danes, and this is evident by the election of Folkeparti to actual parliamentary seats, and the increasingly difficult requirements for entry. You could be **married** to a Dane and still have ridiculous amounts of trouble getting in unfortunately.

Sweden, on the other hand, is probably the easiest of the three. Still - it's difficult to get into any country without already having a degree and being well-established. Sweden isn't exactly an exception. For a long time though, Sweden actually allowed people from any country to go to their Universities for free. Unfortunately for you, this has changed and takes effect Fall of 2011 - you're a year too late to take advantage of that.

There is a Canada-specific agreement Sweden has that will allow a Canadian citizen to come and seek work in Sweden for up to a year, and this has no education/skill requirements. It may be worth it to you to try this for a year and see how you like life there, but it is not a permanent option.

If you're looking for a permanent option, the best options at your disposal (in my opinion) are

* Go to school in Canada and get a Bachelor degree, preferably in a field experiencing a shortage of professionals in Denmark, Sweden or Norway. This would be the best course of action I believe if you're really set on Denmark and don't want to get residency in another EU country for the purposes of moving to Denmark later. Have a look at the Danish Positive List and see if any of the shortages are in fields of your interest.

* Go to school in Germany or perhaps another EU nation. Germany actually has some very low tuition rates for foreigners in some schools, and teach the courses in English. After getting a degree, you'll probably qualify for a residence permit, and if not, you'll be considered skilled and have a much easier time getting a work permit in most places.

The market, based on both supply and demand sets the price after all. There is a liquidity issue and a shortage of buyers (due to a lack of credit..) but that isn't the same as a shortage of housing in most of the markets you mentioned (China being a rather different case of course, it would be hard to find another state that can do building and then mandatory relocation on the same scale).

In many European countries there's a myriad of things that contribute to the situation.  
Shortage of land isn't a physical issue but a legislative issue. Many gov'ts don't designate/release land for residential use unless they can guarantee themselves a certain price point (and thus tax income.)  
At the same time there's rent-controlled council housing (more legislation dating from the days after WWII.) In time, due to rent-control laws that made rents grow at far below inflation rates, this resulted in near-zero investment in more rental housing units.

Mortgage deductions are very high in some places\*\*. So, the higher the property's valuation, the higher the deduction. Big savings to be had so everybody who can piles in.
The banks see an opportunity and play ball and offer zero-down 120% financing mortgages. Prices go through the roof, cycle repeats ad infinitum. If you're a developer which type of house would *you* want to build? You only get one guess.

So what you end up with is a HUGE CHASM between ""small, tightly spaced, '40s and '50s vintage, leaky single-pane row-houses that are supposed to be for poor people"" and ""grandiose half-million-plus villas"" with almost nothing available in between.  
So it's either €500 a month rent or buy a €500k home with generous help from the gov't.  
Pick your poison, no middle road.

What's that? You wan't a nice house for €150k? Well, you *might* be able to find an abandoned farm out in East-Groningen countryside you can renovate. Hope you can afford the exorbitant gasoline bill to commute to work and buy groceries.

Sunday, April 24, 2005

The Farmer’s Market on Fairfax and 3rd is a Los Angeles landmark, attracting tourists and everyday Angelinos alike, as well as many famous faces. Among the celebrities I have seen there are Muhammad Ali, Terri Garr, Tyra Banks, Laura Linney, Keenan Ivory Wayans, the guitarist for The Cult, Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, and Weird Al Yankovic.

But Ann Coulter is the only celebrity I’ve ever spotted at Farmer’s Market that I wound up fucking in the ass, hard.

It would be fair to observe that my feeling obligated to present the list of celebrities above in roughly Black-White-Black-White order is indicative of my own carefully Liberal sensibilities. And that this sort of conscientiousness is more than a little ridiculous, on examination. But what I notice about myself only on reflection, Ann Coulter seemed to recognize and respond to in an instant, like a puma recognizes an injured giselle. For Ann Coulter is a predator. A predator with a hungry asshole.

I first spotted her sitting at a table in front of The Gumbo Pot with another woman who looked not unlike her, but a generation older (I neglected to ask her at any point subsequently whether this had in fact been her mother). I vaguely recognized her—there’s always a lag time placing faces you know from cable when unconfined to a telescreen—and began to notice, stealing furtive glances up from the copy of Steinbeck I was reading, that she was eyeing me with unsettling scrutiny.

The next thing I knew, her companion (mother?) had left and Coulter was standing over me, looking skeptically at my reading material.

‘The Grapes of Wrath, huh?’

‘Yes’ I said, faking composure. ‘It’s fantastic.’

‘It’s a fantastic primer for vacuous proto-Communists everywhere,’ she said dismissively.

‘I don’t know about that..’

She sighed. ‘I don’t have enough ink in my pen to keep a running list of what you don’t know. May I?’

She motioned to the empty chair next to me.

‘Of course.’ It would be fair to say my voice trembled a little.

She sat and said nothing. Ann Coulter evidently takes an unappreciative view of small talk. That she was eager to continue antagonizing me became evident when I re-opened my recently-insulted book to resume reading. A young man passed in a t-shirt proclaiming ‘Iraq Nam’. She stopped him.

‘1. Haircut. 2. Shower. 3. Get a job, you sniveling hippy,’ she glowered. ‘You’re probably too high to remember that, so write it down--if you can write.’

He looked at her with dismay and scampered away like a kicked cat. She turned to me with bloodlust.

‘What do you think of the war: complete success, or very nearly complete success?’ she asked.

‘Well, in no time—barring the strong possibility of Civil War--we’ll have a democratically-elected anti-US Islamicist government in charge of the world’s second-largest oil reserves, so I’d have to say only very-nearly, on the complete success scale, at a hysterically distorted best.’

She showed her teeth. ‘It sounds to me like you don’t support our troops.’

‘I think that ‘Support Our Troops’ business is the most crass, craven cowardice ever to go unquestioned by the allegedly Liberal media.’

‘Yes? Yes?’ There was oddly growing excitement in her voice.

‘It allows the Administration to absolve itself of responsibility for its own flawed policy. It’s no different than if you sent a classroom of 2nd graders into a burning building, and when anyone objects you throw in their face that they ""don’t support our 2nd graders""’

‘Where do you live?’

‘A few blocks away.’

‘Take me there.’

When we got to my apartment, she looked around glumly.

‘I was thinking you’d have half-burned American flags up on the wall,’ she said, disappointed.

‘That’s ridiculous. I love my country.’

‘Whatever you think that means,’ she said, rolling her eyes. ‘Don’t you have anything nasty to say about the President?’

‘Like what?’

‘Like he’s an imbecile, or corrupt, or a corrupt imbecile—the usual sore-loser bitter chatter.’

‘To be honest, I didn’t like the nasty things that were said about Clinton, and I’ve decided to have respect for the Office, no matter who holds it. I don’t think President Bush is corrupt or an imbecile anyway. Would you like something to drink?’

‘I think maybe this was a mistake,’ she said, starting to go.

‘That’s not to say I don’t disagree strongly with many of his policies and objectives.’

She seemed to reconsider. ‘Like what?’

‘I don’t know. Name one.’

‘Get me a drink first.’

With every point I expressed that ran counter to a view she held, she removed one article of clothing. Soon she sat on my couch naked, gently pulling at her untrimmed pubic hair, staring intently but not quite invitingly at me. The growing hard lump in my throat was just outpaced by the one in my pants. I was a little nervous because we had agreed on the last two points—the need to reconsider the option of nuclear energy, and drilling in the Arctic—and I noticed her oversized nipples were no longer hard.

Luckily, she was, by this point, determined.

‘What do you think,’ she began provocatively, ‘of the President’s plan to privatize Social Security?’

I sighed with relief; this was as sure a promise to seal the deal as her asking if I had a condom.

‘I think it’s a payoff to the Americans the President has always been most intent on pleasing: the richest 1%.’

‘What do you mean?’ she cooed. I noticed her nipples hardening once more. She dropped to her knees in front of me. She pushed me backwards and positioned my legs up in the air.

‘A stock’s value is even now only partially tied to the actual value of any publicly traded company.
But who’s going to profit from inflated valuations when stock prices swell irrationally from the forced, artificial injection of capital?

Her breath was hot on my ‘taint as she lifted my scrotum. ‘Yes? Yes?’

‘You might as well shoehorn billions of dollars into the Baseball Card market. The price of a Derek Jeter rookie will be driven up to hundreds of thousands of dollars—before the bubble bursts and the whole market crashes massively.’ It was getting hard to stay on point as she tongue-fucked my shitter vigorously.

‘Don’t..Stop!!’ her contorted mouth pled from my butthole.

‘The top 1% will sell stocks at the inflated valuations to the novice investors-by-necessity, the market will swell and crash, and the same 1% will come back and re-purchase their holdings at pennies on the dollar. Meanwhile, Social Security will go bankrupt and all the novice investors will be eating catfood for the duration of their ""golden years,'’ barring a massive Federal bailout several hundred times in excess of what the Savings &amp; Loan scandal cost us.’

She sprung up on the couch on all fours and looked over her shoulder at me. She pointed to her twitching, puckered anus. ‘See this?’

I nodded eagerly.

‘I want you to wreck it.’

I spit on my skeezer-pleaser and, prying her ass cheeks apart like a hot dinner roll, drove it home, into the biggest browneye I had ever seen. She gurgled contentedly. Every thrust of my babymaker was met with a wrenched squeal as I grabbed her by the hips and began really leaning into it.

‘Harder!’ she begged, ‘Harder!! Tell me what you think of Chomsky!’

‘I..think..he’s..brill..iant..but..I..don’t really agree with much of his stance on Israel, and--’

‘You’re slowing down!’ she snapped. ‘DON’T SLOW DOWN!’

I went back to punishing her asshole, giving no thought whatsoever to compassionate conservatism as her chocolate socket gnawed on my pork pipe. She was babbling now, as out of a delirious reverie.

‘Feed it,' Ann Coulter rasped. 'Feed my hungry asshole!'

I buried her face in a throw pillow and she swiveled her hips back on my fuckstick with obvious appreciation. My pace quickened as my man-magma built towards eruption.

‘Wait!’ she gasped, sensing the fuse on my yogurt cannon was burning quick. ‘I want to take you ass-to-mouth!’

I withdrew from her puckerhole with an audible ‘pop’ and she scrambled around, gulping at my wang-dang-doodle as though the lives of all her loved ones hinged on her marks for enthusiasm. Her eyes rolled up pleadingly as she threw her head down again and again on my magic johnson. I knew what she wanted.

‘There is a specter haunting Europe,’ I began, and she started to convulse spasmodically with her own thrashing orgasm, her head now dribbling in a blur against my groin. I repeated every Karl Marx quote I could think of until I reached my own ‘historic inevitability’ and launched surge after surge from my hairy boda bag. I ejaculated with what seemed like enough force to blow out the back of her head--but her head was made of stronger stuff. She sputtered, gobbled and gulped what I’d have to call a very liberal, even radically so, quantity of hot splooey.

Once she caught her breath, she wiped her mouth, stood, and took me by the hand.

‘Let’s go to the bathroom.’

‘Why?’

She seemed surprised I had to ask. Her tone was that of someone reminding another of something too obvious to need mention.

‘Uh, so I can get in the tub and you can piss all over me?’

I sat in a robe and watched her as she dressed.

‘Will I see you again?’ I asked tentatively.

‘Sure,’ she said, pointing to the TV. ‘On that.’

Some moments passed. I tried to dispel the awkward silence.

‘Well, nice meeting you,’ I offered.

‘You’ve really got a gift for tedious small talk,’ she shot back.

I was a little hurt and, recognizing this, she softened just a shade as she reached for her purse to leave.

‘Hey.’

‘Yes?’ I asked.

‘Thanks for not staring at my adam’s apple.’

‘No problem.’

She let herself out without another word, and I sat in the late afternoon silence alone. I considered how it felt to be a disposable instrument in someone’s personal debasement fantasy.

Again, you are thinking about this in vague qualitative terms (""poor"" versus ""rich""). Read the NYT link, where it quantifies what this means **and explains how the graph was calculated in PPP terms**. Recall, to be ""rich"" in India (as defined by being in the top 5% earners) all you have to do is earn USD10 a day (I think this figure might not be adjusted for PPP, but even if you adjust it, it comes out to about USD30 a day, which is just over USD10,000 in annual income).

If you asked me ""Would you rather be among the 5% poorest in the US or the 5% richest in India?"" I would ask for the data on their income and consumption in PPP terms. And based on that, I would choose to be among the 5% poorest in the US. Is it guaranteed I'll be richer than the richest person in India? Of course not; it's certain I'll be poorer than the richest Indian person. But is it likelier that I'll be richer on average (i.e. the expected value of my choice) versus the same average for India? Absolutely yes.

&gt;You are comparing countries that are MUCH larger (China/India) or countries that are MUCH poorer (Brazil).

The graph shows domestic income distributions in the US, China, India and Brazil, and where each ventile in these distributions is relative to world income. It's not hard to understand; the axes are labeled. The comparison is meant to put in perspective the distribution of US income relative to these countries and the world's distribution of income.

Also, Brazil is much richer than China and India in PPP GDP per capita.

&gt;Unlike the Gini Coefficent, this IS NOT population independent.

You realise that the Gini coefficient is just derived from a Lorenz curve, right, which is exactly what this graph is? This statement is just flat out wrong -- **if percentiles aren't a population independent measure, I have no idea what is**.

&gt;I would like the same graph done with U.S. vs the EU.

This has little to do with the point of the headline, though. You're right that it would be a useful illustration, I'd like to see it too.

&gt;The ""bottom 5%"" is also adjusted for government programs, when the 'real value' of food stamps, any health benefits, etc. etc. is added in it will skew the results. There is NO WAY this was not done.

You may be right, but this is what makes developed countries nice places to live. It would be folly not to include this as income. What would happen to the income distribution of Sweden or any other large welfare state if we excluded all welfare benefits in these comparisons?

I'm saying the onus is on the wrong facet of what healthcare is about.

It's like the housing ""market""..  remember when houses were just things people lived in?   

I'm not saying Govt control of drug companies is the answer, I'm saying the way things are handled now is susceptible to greed-based thinking over the purpose of which these companies theoretically exist for.

The govt in your country right now pays for a large percentage of drug research, only to have large companies come in at the end, finish off the research, patent the drug for themselves then charge you the taxpayer a ridiculous amount for something your tax dollars used as it's own catalyst for creation.

I agree that our models have their flaws as well, which stem from govt mismanagement ironically..  but the flaws we have do not compare to the flaws the private model has, particularly if you don't earn a massive amount of money or are not covered by the company you work for.

It all seems so convoluted.

edit:  this article can give a little more insight into the realm of skullfuckery that is the current IP mechanism in place for the production of drugs.

http://www.ip-watch.org/weblog/2009/07/08/eu-finds-anti-competitive-abuse-of-pharmaceutical-patents-launches-antitrust-action/

This is merely the IP side of the problem, it does not touch upon the research and production, the research side particularly is where the Tax payers lose out.

These companies could sell the drugs at an affordable price and still be raking in mega profits, but they don't..  they do the opposite and work as hard as possible to ensure the delay of generic alternatives that would help god knows how many people in countries less fortunate than your(/our) own.

I know it's not just US pharma companies, the problem is endemic to the industry.

Some free market radicals would put it to you that intellectual property rights are a government-enforced monopoly that should not be recognised.

&gt;And look at how the West ignores them when they need to. When Korea hit a bad recession in the late 90s, the IMF forced them to have no budget deficits, and they had over 100 corporations a day going under. After a few months the IMF relented and allowed Korea to have a small deficit. Under 1% of GDP if I remember correctly.

It worked out well for South Korea in the end, although the IMF is a piece of shit institution anyway. Again, the free market radical would say bailouts as well as deficits are a bad idea, both in the west and the developing world.

&gt;Meanwhile, European countries and the US run huge deficits during a recession. How can these neoliberal policies work, if we don't even use them ourselves?

These countries also have better-established institutions of welfare and social spending entitlements. Developing countries, especially those going under at the time like Indonesia and Malaysia and Thailand, would run a huge deficit mainly for corporate welfare. I'm from Malaysia; I know.

&gt; Since their return to public life in the mid-1970s, Egypt’s Muslim Brothers have repeatedly rejected the allegation that they are aiming to establish a “theocratic” religious state. They argue that “theocratic politics means the rule of religious people—preachers and popes and the like who have no official place in Islam, [which is] a religion in which no one mediates between man and God.” Moreover, theocratic intervention is said to be a purely European medieval experience that has no parallel in the history of Islamic states, where the ruler has always been a civilian.
&gt;
&gt; In practice, however, the Muslim Brothers have sought to advance the prospects of a theocratic state in a variety of ways.
&gt;
&gt;First, they rely heavily on the second article of the Egyptian Constitution, which states that “Islam is the religion of the state, and the principles of the Sharia are the main source of legislation.” At the same time, they conveniently ignore other provisions of the Constitution, in particular Article 1, which states that Egypt is a democratic state based on citizenship; Article 3, which states that power is in the hands of the people; and Articles 40 and 46, which unequivocally assert the total equality of the country’s citizens.
&gt;
&gt;Second, the Brothers are bound to make fatwa-making—based on a religious interpretation of the holy books—part of the country’s legislative process. And once legislation is based on verses of the Quran and on hadiths, politics will have become an exclusively Muslim domain, and these same sources will be invoked by Islamists to put into place public policies detrimental to individual freedom, particularly against non-Muslim creeds (as discussed above) and against freedom of expression in art and literature.
&gt;
&gt;Third, the Muslim Brothers insist on slogans and political symbols that are religious and theocratic. By proclaiming that “Islam is the solution, they actually negate the process of social and political bargaining, characteristic of a democracy, that cannot be constrained by a specific interpretation of sacred books. And of no less importance, the Brothers’ logo displays two crossing swords, between which is the Quran and below which is the verse of the Quran that calls for preparedness and the accumulation of all possible powers to fight the enemies of God and of the faithful. Given the adversarial nature of the political process, this view transforms every conflict or disagreement into a “holy war” against the “enemies of God,” thereby contradicting every democratic and civic tradition.
&gt;
&gt;Fourth, the Muslim Brothers’ new party platform proposes to make the practical expressions of the theocratic state much more salient than before. The 128-page program states that “the Islamic State is by necessity a civic state,” and the civic state is defined as one based on the principle that public functions should be performed by efficient, specialized experts; the role played by elected officials is to implement the will of the people, who are the real source of power.21 Yet this definition should be understood within the context of the Brothers’ declaration that the Sharia, not the Constitution, is the proper basis of legislation, and that it will be considered binding on all elected citizens:
&gt;
&gt;“The Islamic Sharia should be implemented based on the vision agreed upon by the nation through a parliamentary majority of the legislature, elected freely with integrity and real transparency. . . . The legislature should ask for the opinion of a commission of the nation’s great religious authorities. This commission should be elected freely and directly by the ulama [religious scholars] and should be truly and totally independent from the executive power:technically, financially, and administratively. The commission’s work will be aided by ommittees, experienced consultants, and efficient experts in all areas of life and science, who are well known for their honesty and neutrality. This also applies to those decisions of the President that have the power of law in the absence of the legislative power. The opinions of the commission will be based on the public interest as it relates to [each] specific subject. The legislature, in cases that are not related to definitive religious rulings based on irrefutable evidence, has the right to decide by an absolute majority. Before making its final decision, the legislature may review the case with the religious commission to determine what is closest to the public interest. The law will define the characteristics of the religious personalities who will have the right to elect the members of the commission.”(emphasis added) Thus, the religious commission will have the final say, at least regarding all issues on which the Sharia provides “irrefutable evidence.” The commission will not be based on equal citizenship, since women, Copts, and non-Muslims cannot be members—thereby contradicting the Brothers’ earlier statement regarding non-Muslims, namely that “what is for us in terms of rights is for them.”23 Politically, in all cases of differing beliefs and interpretations, the creation of the religious commission for legislation will open the gates for political and religious strife, revolving around which institution should have the upper hand in the legislative process.

This commission of religious experts is basically what Iran has

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_of_Experts

In fact the Muslim Brotherhood could easily implement the Iranian model. They're leader is called a Supreme Guide. He's be the Supreme Leader once they take over. Their Assembly of Experts will write the constitution and install hooks into the democratic system to vet candidates, veto laws where they go against ""irrefutable evidence"" and so on. 

&gt;
&gt;Fifth, the Brothers’ draft party platform stipulates “the state has essential religious functions,” and that “these religious functions are embodied in the head of state or prime minister, according to the existing political system; therefore, the head of state or prime minister [will] have duties that contradict the beliefs of non-Muslims. This does not allow for asking non-Muslims to serve in such a position because the Islamic Sharia, does not commit non-Muslims to duties that may contradict their creed.”24 (emphasis added) 
&gt;
&gt;Sixth, the religious functions of the head of state not surprisingly led the draft party platform to state, for example, that “it has to be noted that the decision [to declare] war represents a religious decision, which means that it must accord with the goals, aims, and fundamental principles of the Islamic Sharia. Depending on the political system, this will make the head of state or prime minister responsible for providing a religious justification to declare war. He has a religious duty to do that.”25 As wars will thereby lose their nationalist dimension, this means that the conscription of non-Muslims will not be acceptable, opening the door to levying a “protection tax,” or jeziya, on non-Muslims. (This had already been proposed by Mustafa Mashhour, the Brothers’ former Supreme Guide.)

I.e. they want an Iranian style system where a religious commission can overrule Parliament.

In fact the state they propose will be much more repressive than the Mubarak regime

&gt; A Heavy-Handed State
&gt;
&gt; Anyone complaining about the heavy-handed nature of the current Egyptian state, with its notorious bureaucracy of more than seven million employees, would do well to consider the type of government proposed by the Muslim Brothers.27 The new draft party program borrows heavily from 1960s left-leaning literature regarding Third World development, in which the state is to play a highly interventionist role in running the economy and the society. The Brothers’ program also suggests ending the process of privatizing public sector companies that is presently being undertaken in the framework of reforming the Egyptian economy.
&gt;
&gt;With this in mind, the Brothers suggest that Egypt’s economy should first achieve “self-sufficiency” in the vital areas of food, medicine, and armaments and with respect to both providing for all the needs of its citizens—for clothing, housing, and transportation as well as food—and improving the environment while making it safe. Second, they propose to increase governmental investment in the service sectors of health and education, an investment intended to improve the quality of those services and to increase employment.30 Third, the Brothers propose “gigantic national projects” to develop the Sinai, the New Valley (Western Desert), the Western Coast, and the Eastern desert, as well as huge projects and programs in the nuclear, space, aviation, and bioengineering realms.Finally, the Brothers promise to make sure that the public and private sectors develop an “integrated industrial base for ‘strategic [that is, military] industries’ that will contribute inputs to civilian industries.”
&gt;
&gt;Clearly, a state organized along such lines will exert a totalitarian reach over the entire Egyptian polity, as has been the case in the past with Third World countries, including Egypt. Such a state will control not only all aspects of the economy, from production to consumption to employment; it will also adopt a bellicose foreign policy based on the increasing militarization of the state.

Many of the largest buildings in Saskatchewan are government owned utilities, the province was the origin of modern universal health care, and Tommy Douglas (a Saskatchewan hero) was named Canada's greatest Canadian by a rigorous CBC poll.  Also, many immigrants in Saskatchewan came from Eastern Europe, and brought 'socialist' ideas with them.

Alberta, on the other hand, primarily came from eastern Canadian immigrants, and US immigrants (several waves).  Traditionally the province voted social credit (best described as being right wing [both socially and economically] but distrustful of banks).   It was always a little bit more right wing and pro-US than the rest of Canada, but the real modern Alberta emerged in the 1980's.  Around this time, it was discovered that Alberta had a shit-ton of oil, right as the price shot upwards.  Since all of Canada needed oil, under Trudeau's equalization payments, the rest of Canada got cheap(er) oil, but Alberta wasn't allowed to maximize profits for itself (instead, being forced to share).  Alberta has fought this tooth and nail ever since, now the richest province in Canada, and completely resentful of other provinces for ever trying to take their oil money.  The Conservative party is an unmovable bloc in Alberta - as long as oil revenues continue to make the people rich and tax free (while also funding those nice little social programs), corruption is irrelevant as long as the trains run on time, taxes stay as low as possible, and oil keeps being pumped through the province's veins.

No doubt that there are Muslim Holocaust deniers still out there, and this is a good way to show that this is not a matter of religion, but a matter of personal view.

I hope some Muslims will eventually pay Armenia a visit, too, and tell Turkey to fuck off.

Now I know that someone's going to come here and claim that the Holocaust is a hoax. On the one hand, it's good that they are questioning it. The West is expectedly Western-oriented (that's not a bad thing, not really a good thing either), and the Holocaust occurring so close to home and so recently gives it some ignorance-increasing attributes. We take it for granted that it happened (it did) and it happened exactly the way the textbooks say it did (not quite, but close). On the other hand, outright denying the Holocaust just plain shows that you didn't do your homework.

The Holocaust HAS been hijacked by Israel. While they go ahead and commit atrocities to the Palestinian people, it's as if though they have a right to do those things because it happened to the people they represent, the Jews.

The fact of the matter is that the Holocaust has become so synonymous with the Jewish genocide that we forget about the other people killed during the Holocaust, as well as other genocides in other parts of the world. Not only that, but the Holocaust is the only genocide given emphasis in the United States, when the genocide that SHOULD be taught about in all schools is the genocide of the people who inhabited America before the Europeans.

As an economic structure, the EU benefits each of its member states massively. Thinking of the EU as a more posh US is useful only as a shallow analogy. Economically speaking, the two are vastly different and the EU is a much stronger entity. (Look at the IMF GDP figures. Germany comes in FOURTH in the list of highest GDP. With the EU, it's first) If the US were to create an economic entity with a set of fictional countries that were more successful than itself, you can bet that it's infrastructure would improve greatly.

&gt;Here are some significant differences:

&gt;1) The Mujahideen's expulsion of the Soviet-backed government was violent, and made so with tens of billions of dollars from Uncle Sam, Pakistan, and other EU countries (irony alert - we inflated/created the monster that is the Taliban).

&gt;The Egyptian protests, largely led by college-educated twenty-somethings, have been remarkably peaceful in comparison. What reports of violence have emerged are often accompanied by suspicions that the men perpetrating the violence are carrying gov't issued arms.

&gt;2) The Mujahideen was the principal party to the political unrest in Afghanistan. They are a radicalized faction of Islam who happened to be an enemy of our enemy. So we gave them boat loads of money and over-looked their glaring shortcomings.

&gt;The Muslim Brotherhood (the only possible Mujahideen equivalent) in Egypt have never sen this kind of support from the US or other western-aligned nation-states.

The U.S. cannot spend as much on its infrastructure because of the following reasons:


1) EU has 27 member states encompassing 4M square kilometers, with 500M people. The US has 50 states encompassing 9.8M square kilometers, with 308M people. Thus, the EU is highly concentrated in a small area, making large infrastructure a benefit to large portions of the population, whereas the US has less people and more area to cover.




2) EU has GDP of $16.4T, Germany has GDP of $3.3T. US has $14.6T, California has $1.9T. EU has 6 nations in the top 20 GDP. US has four states. You vastly underestimate the economic power of each state in the U.S. Four member states are individually richer than our largest state's GDP. Six U.S. states are worse off than Bulgaria. The fact of the matter is that we just don't have as much money individually speaking. Moreover, the EU has the luxury of choosing which countries can be adopted (and can thus avoid unstable economies). The US can't (see: Michigan). 





3) The EU doesn’t spend money on shit like defense, healthcare, social security. Look at how they actually spent their budget: It’s top five expenditures are: Agriculture, regional aid for poor/remote areas(ex: East Germany/Bulgaria), foreign aid, administration, and research. US’s top five expenditures are: Social Security, Defense, Medicare, Medicaid, and Unemployment/Welfare. For comparison, Germany’s expenditures are: Social Security, General Public Services (healthcare), Defense, Public Order and Safety (police, administration), and economic affairs. 



See? The definition of a nation is important because a nation spends the majority of its budget on its citizen’s day to day needs. The EU doesn’t care about social security money, healthcare, defense, etc. because that’s the responsibility of the sovereign member state. The fact that the EU’s third highest expenditure is FOREIGN AID, speaks a volumes about its priorities. (I dare you to look at any sovereign nation and look at what percentage of their budget goes toward foreign aid. The EU is not a nation. The EU and the US have different priorities).

&gt;It would be like prohibition - if people want it they will get it.

No, it wouldn't, because I can easily make liquor in my backyard with some yeast, starch, and water. Making ballistics is just a *tad* more complicated. Yes, we'd have problems controlling people with firearms once they're illegal. This is a fact of life and cannot be changed. But it would reduce gun crime significantly, and I don't give a shit if your gun saves you from an imaginary attack every day you wake up, because somewhere, there's a *real* attack going on that may've been prevented had we restricted gun control. You think of yourself and those around you, and no others. But they're all outside the monkeysphere, right?

&gt;I happens about once a year for me. I've never had to fire the weapon but I have shown it to a few assholes that decide real quick that they should go somewhere else.

Once a year? You're throwing a shit fit over once a year? If you were in the way of serious bodily harm, sure, that sounds relatively reasonable, but it sounds like you're brandishing your pistol to college kids outside your local bar. Oh, while we're on the subject of testosterone injections...

&gt;Well I dont use the gun for a replacement penis I use it to prevent my ass from getting shot.

Oh you don't? Well, you must live in a pretty rough neighborhood...

&gt;visit my BJJ school any day of the week

BJJ school? I wasn't aware dojos were popular in poverty stricken districts. Though, at least you're not bragging...

&gt;I promise I'm not afraid to use my weapon - TRY ME!
&gt;lemme know you coming and we'll see who the pussy is! (Or: COME AT ME BRO)

Okay. You know what? This is getting out of hand. And I don't remember ever calling you a pussy, I'm pret-

&gt;You can call me a pussy all you want - you can make personal attacks all you want.

Shit! I apologize so much! I must've gotten under your skin-

&gt;Makes no difference to me. 

Okay, cool then.

I'm positive you have a good reason, anyway; I don't know who you are, where you come from, or what it's like for you, so I can't say that you, specifically, are in the wrong in trying to defend yourself. I can say, however, that it is detrimental to society to allow such weapons to be owned by the public. This has been proven time and time again, and the only fucking reason we have guns still is dipshit NRA lobbyists that are in bed with S&amp;W, and the 2nd amendment, which is so ridiculous an argument I can barely stand it.

&gt;There have been many many many cases where the intended victim used their weapon to defend themselves.

There are many, many more cases where the intended victim gets killed, and their weapon stolen. 

You might be right on your first point. Law abiding citizens may not be the problem. And, in the legal system, where every man is innocent before proven guilty, they should not be treated as criminals. But in the real world, a law abiding citizen can get shot and his guns stolen. It actually happens every day. Usually when someone aims to kill you, they're not going to jump out with their gun pointed, and then just stand there frozen for a few seconds. Usually they're going to hide, and when you're close, but unaware, grab you, take your shit, and if you do something stupid like try to pull a gun out, kill you. 

&gt;I started carrying when one woman was dragged from her car rapped and killed, beated to death mind you.

Was this a news story you saw? Because I have to tell you, in the middle ages, before guns were even available, they called that a slow news day. It is a terribly unfortunate occurrence for such inhumane acts to be committed in our modern and free society, but one must realize that it is never going to stop. Giving people guns is a fucking stupid idea because that just breeds hatred, distrust and all that is vulgar and foul amongst our kin. 

I'm not saying you're a pussy, just someone that cannot see the other side of the argument clearly enough to make an informed decision. But hey, don't trust me, trust the evidence.

Bonus information, and I wonder if that's what he was referring to with his very strange idea of what ""national socialism"" might mean:

It turns out that integrating a former state-Socialist economy into a [Social Market Economy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_market_economy) is a rather expensive endeavor. So far, the Reunification has cost close to €2T, and it keeps costing some €100B each year. Unemployment in the East is still almost twice that of the West, and wages are noticeably lower -- it's getting better, though.  
Anyway, the German economy took a huge hit after the Reunification when all those unsustainable businesses in the East closed down and a huge investment in infrastructure there was necessary. Germany used to be called ""the sick man of Europe"" until just a few years ago, a title that got passed around ever since the Ottoman Empire. So, in the late 90's, the government, employer associations and the unions got together and formed a pact to increase competitiveness and reduce unemployment. The main point was that workers accepted stagnant real wages (!) in return for employment and professional training guarantees from the employers. This lasted about until the current crisis began. Now the economy is doing quite well, given the current circumstances, and unions are making demands again.  
What also helped were social reforms, notably deep and unpopular cuts to the welfare state that eventually cost the Social Democrat/Green government coalition the reelection (there is a line of thinking that only the Social Democrats can do that, because the conservatives wouldn't be able to handle the unions.) That this upswing, that had just began to emerge, made it through the crisis is probably due to [Kurzarbeit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurzarbeit).

Your argument is simple minded. The point is that people who create intellectual property have the right to profit from it - otherwise why bother? 

Lets take an example of a motor car. If someone spent a $100m developing a car, but anyone can come along a take the technology and sell a replica, they would not be able to recoup their investment. Next time they wouldn't bother. Then you would find much less development of new ideas going on. Music can get away without this problem more or less because the development costs are low, but watch what happens when films that costs $hundreds of millions to create a pirated widely - there will be no money to develop the ideas any more. 

Copying &amp; distributing music is depriving the original artist of fees they could have earned if people had bought it. There is a lot to be said for distribution helping bands sell more music and tickets etc, but it is still fair to pay for what you use. 

Dont get me wrong - the music and film industries have screwed up this problem for 15 years - but the answer is not simply let it be free for everyone that wants it free. Any fool can see the economics of that wont work. I would be happy to see the music industry charge a very low fee per song.

Well, we cut the Ottoman empire up at the tail end of World War II and took what is probably considered the most strategic piece of land in history in order to prop up a regime that has no relevant cultural or historical significance to the land.

So that right there is massive and has been the defining action from which all others in the Middle East has happened.

Now, specifically, what did we do in what specific country? UAE? We let them have money. See how that turned out for them? Libya? We culturally and economically isolated them from any other sphere of influence with the threat of huge sanctions. We don't even have to discuss the shady shit that went on there during the 70s and 80s. That's just kind of insignificant in this context.

Syria? See above.

Jordan, Qatar, Oman, Brunei, and any other geographically (read: politically insignificant) all fit very nicely into this context of fringing. Eighty years ago these countries had ""viable"" economic alternatives to doing business with the West. Even forty years ago when the paradigm between the Soviet Union/China and the United States was ongoing was the pressure from this situation greatly reduced.

In modern society you can simplify the corporate relationships between China, Japan, Russia, the United States, and western Europe into a single business entity. What remains can simply be referred to as ""the third world.""

It is very well known and understood that the next century will see economic development in this ""third world"" geographic area (read: Asia) that has never been seen before in the history of this planet. Essentially what will be accomplished there is an undertaking of scope at least ten times greater than the settling of the American west and it will be accomplished in a fraction of the time.

It isn't our fault. Fault is not a political concept that has any reality. This is about making money and what you are seeing taking place today in the world is a result of sixty, seventy, maybe a hundred and fifty years of advanced planning.

*This is not some kind of screwball analysis or bullshit conspiracy. There is no ""designer"" to this system: Political systems promote very specific set of ideals and they cultivate very specific kinds of people and character traits that will allow for success. ANY of these individuals will be of sufficient intelligence to see what the person BEFORE him saw and be able to CONTINUE the work.*

It's about a lot more than ""don't feed the poor""--which actually I think is a misinterpretation of what he was trying to say, much as Social Darwinism is a misinterpretation of Darwin.

I do think Quinn has a valid point about how increased food supplies result in increased populations. But there's a lot more going on than just the simple equation of ""more food=higher population"", which Quinn himself is aware of but some of his readers may not be.

Consider this; that countries with the most rapid population growth also tend to be countries that are the most male-dominated, where the women have the fewest rights and tend to be viewed as the property of men. Countries with the lowest population growth tend to be countries that treat women the best.

Also, note, too, how it's the wealthy countries that tend to have the lowest population growth; US and Canada, Europe, Japan. It's these wealthiest countries that have the most abundant food, correct? So why don't they have the most population growth?

And by contrast one would think that the countries with the most malnutrition--the most starvation, would have the lowest population growth, but that's not what we see. They have the highest, not the lowest. So what's going on there?

I'll also note that the countries with the greatest population growth also tend to be the least-educated, therefore prone to various false superstitions and fallacies, with a weak understanding of cause and effect, and the consequences of one's own actions.

That doesn't invalidate Quinn's argument. I'm just saying there's more to it than just food=growth. 

Also, consider that for Quinn this is actually a side topic. His main theme is about Leavers vs. Takers--what I call Persuader Societies vs. Coercer/Dominator Societies. These two types of cultures stem from two very different mindsets and sets of beliefs, and that in turn has a strong affect on human attitudes, behaviors and effect on the natural world. I agree. It fits what I experience.

And I would say, that population growth is strongly correlated with how much a given society fits the Taker pattern vs. the Leaver pattern. Leaver cultures tend to be more contented, more stable, more environmentally benign, and have little to no population growth.

So I would say, moving a society towards the Leaver style of culture is a better, more humane solution than ""starve the poor"". Though there is a big problem with how a lot of the food being sent to these starving countries tends to get taken by the wrong people--taken by the elites who need it the least. Which of course is part of why they're called ""Taker"" cultures.

It is not necessary to force a people to starve in order to stop population growth. Its all a little too Malthusian for me. 

And careful about that idea of ""aid to needy countries"". Aid, per se, is not the problem--people in Leaver cultures aid each other far more than those in Taker cultures. The problem is the ""aid"" is being given in a Taker style, not a Leaver style. In other words, little of it reaches those it was ostensibly intended for, those who need it the most. It tends instead to go towards propping up the dominant elites--not just the aid recipients but the elite givers as well--as witness how IMF loans tend to bankrupt loan recipients (the countries receiving such loans), leaving the creditors (money center banks and affiliate megacorps) more dominant than before.

It will be fascinating to watch the world change when the power shifts towards those Asian giants. It has always been the Occidental view that Western culture is inherently the ""highest"" state that all other cultures somehow naturally progress towards. I do not believe this to be the case. There are some aspects that will turn out to be universal, but others will not. China, India and others will retain some of their cultural identity and mix it with other aspects that come with a higher standard of living.

&gt; Ultimately I think Germany will benefit greatly in the long run from developing East Germany.

Economically, I'm not actually sure. Scale is something that happens on the EU level, where borders have already lost most of their former effects on the economy, and harmonization of laws and regulations continues. I suspect that it won't be long (in historical terms) and European integration will harmonize taxation as well. Sure, there's language and to a certain degree cultural differences that limit movement of labor somewhat, but for business to business it's not that important.  
Obviously, that's from a Western perspective, no doubt the East has profited immensely.

However, politically the additional size means more influence within the EU, and we can see this in the changed dynamics between Germany and France. That's only a side effect, though, of the political conviction that a reunification would happen sooner or later that had existed ever since the founding of the Federal Republic (the West) after the War, and that it was somehow self-evident that the two territories belonged together. Forty years later, the Wall fell, everybody was euphoric, East Germans moved West en masse (automatic citizenship) and less than a year later Germany was unified.  
Had it taken one or two generations longer, I doubt it would have happened this way -- remember, this was 20 years ago and the political elite was a generation that could still remember a united Germany. Once it wouldn't have been in living memory anymore, this thinking would have vanished in the historic blurriness of what exactly this Germany consisted of (e.g., the [Holy Roman Empire](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/HRR_1789_EN.png) (or even [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Holy_Roman_Empire_1648.svg)) was a loose federation that included Austria as a part of ""Germany"", the Kaiserreich did not, the Third Reich did again, etc.) Germany only actually was a proper nation state between 1871 and 1945, and now again for the past twenty.

So what does that make you? A pudgy, European adult (PEA)? 


""Dude, the preferred nomenclature is European-American."" 

Asia is a big place. By being ""Asian"" this kid's ethnicity could be one of hundreds or one of thousands of combinations of those. Even being Chinese means your background could ethnically be any of dozens. 

Y-DNA haplogroups don't go by nation or continent and in the case of that boy and billions like him worldwide ethnicity of a common heritage, language, culture, shared religion and ideology doesn't even include common ancestry - because by all accounts but the genetic one he is an American. 

So to call someone Asian would be the equivalent of calling someone a European. It's nonsensical to group people like that out of context and if it is a convention or a norm then we should kill the convention sooner than a person's identity which doesn't fit the convention just because it doesn't fit the convention.

That kid was telling you something. You should listen.

&gt;I don't get why this has turned into a racism circlejerk

Well, since *you* are the one so hell-bent on calling it trolling and falling for a racial stereotype then by virtue of definition the kid is right - you are, in fact, racist.

You know the kid is from parents at the Chinese *food* restaurant next door, yes? 

Yet you have called the restaurant Chinese, the kid Asian, the language Mandarin.

You have all but said ""I have never met the kid's parents even though their son frequents my store"".  You should seriously check yourself. Your attitude seems to be that *others* are acceptable as long as they are cute, ""Asian"" kids who don't speak with the ""wrong"" accent. 

What are his parent's names? How old are they? How long have they been running the restaurant? What did they do before that? Are they Chinese? Were they born there? Taiwan? Mainland? Which region? Did they run a restaurant there, too? Why? Why not? You either bothered to find that out or you didn't. No one is going to point this out to you because most people around you take your exact same normative view that that kind of prejudice is acceptable. They are quite happy to let sitcom people be PC - they have to be on TV - but IRL we can laugh behind people's backs at racial stereotypes because they are perfectly innocent forms of humor and nobody gets hurt, right? 

&gt;Can't we all just enjoy a story about a funny kid without taking it too damn seriously?

More info from Al Jazeera:

- Possibly the police is siding with the pro-Mubarak protesters (not surprising, but a serious problem).

- Two tanks has just been moved into one of the side streets, the soldiers are trying to calm down the crowds. The reporter says that pro-Mubarak protesters are trying to enter the square, try to incite more violence.

- Many people have returned to the square with bloody head injuries (and other).

- Footage of people on horses and a camel is shown, possibly armed security officers with the pro-Mubarak supporters. *EDIT*: broke through a chain of anti-government protesters and stormed into the square, trampling several people.


- Al Jazeera also reported that yesterday the army arrested several persons.

- Report of a journalist having been stabbed.

(Wouldn't be surprised if there are a significant amount of plainclothes and hired thugs among one side..)

Reporter: **absolute mayhem**
(and footage confirms this..)

*EDIT 2*: reporter states that it were about 50 horses, not stopped by the army and actually accompanied by several uniformed officers of the security forces.

*EDIT 3*: same situation now reported in Suez.

*EDIT 4*: footage showing the men on horsed charging into anti-government protesters, after which several are taken down.

Pro-government protesters seem to have chased away soldiers, who have retreated to their original positions, after being attacked with rocks by pro-gov supporters. Hundreds of pro-gov protesters now have a free way to the square..

Pro-gov protesters also reported to chant against Al Jazeera..

*EDIT 5*: Al Jazeera reports that it has been confirmed that several pro-Mubarak supporters are carrying police IDs. Al Jazeera shows anti-gov protesters holding up police IDs that they grabbed from pro-gov protesters: http://yfrog.com/h04qtdj  (the actual footage is a bit more clear, I grabbed this screenshot from twitter)

*EDIT 6*: Can anyone confirm reading/hearing this:
""Breaking Al Jazeera: Egyptian Army statement warns pro-Mubarak supporters from attacking peaceful protesters or it will interfere decisively""?  (http://twitter.com/SultanAlQassemi) I haven't heard that being said.

*EDIT 7*: Reporter who was with the pro-gov supporters describes: 'about 50 young men took off their shirts, then stormed the square armed with sticks and machetes, followed by hundreds of other protesters.'

*EDIT 8*: three army trucks have been taken over by pro-gov supporters, now being driven into anti-gov protesters according to journalist? (&lt;-very unsure what the actual facts are)

Several bangs, sounded like possible gunfire but not confirmed, probably not?

*EDIT 9*: Al Jazeera reporter at the scene says that it were probably warning shots being fired by soldiers/security forces guarding the Cairo museum. Other reporter confirms that it was without a doubt live fire.

*EDIT 10*: Military tried to maneuver a tank between the groups, pro-mubarak supporters tried to abuse it as cover, military retreated.

Building reportedly being set on fire. 

*EDIT 11*: more live fire being reported by one of the journalists on the location, people on the run, after pro-gov protesters broke through (didn't hear it).

*EDIT 12*: Teargas being used at the place of the clashes.

More live fire reported, helicopter now circling.

*EDIT 13*: anti-gov protesters have to retreat signficantly because pro-gov protesters are throwing projectiles from the top of several buildings.

*EDIT 14*: Ban Ki-Moon: these actions against peaceful protests are unacceptable.

Really horrible to hear one of the panicking reporters on the ground there.. :(

*EDIT 15*: one of the reporters who broke up during a previous interview was attacked by pro-mubarak thugs, they were dispersed by warning shots.

*EDIT 16*: reporter describes a man being beaten in front of soldiers by pro-mubarak protesters, who luckily managed to flee behind the tanks during a moment of confusion.

*EDIT 17*: Captured army truck with pro-gov supporters seems to be driven into the square. (edit: seeing the footage again, it seemed to have been pushed)

*EDIT 18*: didn't hear more about #17.
Ban Ki-Moon's speech shown.
One of the buildings in the middle of the clashes seems on fire.

*Smoke rising from the museum* Teargas? 

*EDIT 19*: footage shows a 'petrol bomb' (acc. to AJ, burning object that's for sure) thrown from the buildings.

*EDIT 20*: AJ: UN estimates 300 people have been killed (unclear whether today or total), at least 500 wounded today.

**EDIT 21**: found a picture on a news website where I noticed that one of the people on it is about to be stabbed, with a few people seemingly rushing towards him to help? http://media.nu.nl/m/m1fzwgfanp2r_700.jpg

*EDIT 22*: EU High Representative Ashton live on AJ. About to speak with EU parliament. Nothing interesting to say of course.. Ugh, I get seriously annoyed with these empty words over and over again. Take a REAL stance!

*EDIT 23*: some sort of intervention with watercannons. More molotov cocktails being used.

*EDIT 24*: Obama has supposedly been on the phone with Mubarak for 30 minutes. Reporter says there probably have been some frank and harsh words.

*EDIT 25*: AJ: AFP reports petrol bombs landed on the museum grounds, small fire. AJ shows footage of a police officer being carried on the shoulders of pro-gov supporters. 

*EDIT 26*: reporter says that she saw lorries filled with pro-gov protesters being directed to the city center in an organized manner.

Anderson Cooper tells how he and his crew were attacked by pro-mub protesters: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7LO5G0R08o

Dutch journalist (http://twitter.com/RGjournalist) tweets that:
- he was attacked by pro-mub protesters:
- recalls a tweet that an Al-Arabiya journalist was stabbed (think I wrote it somewhere above too, as I heard it being mentioned once on AJ), info was probably incorrect (came from local radio)
- that uniformed police officers in one instance protected him.

Initially she'd read it as a ""guilty pleasure"", knowing not to trust anything she saw in it, but as the years went on, she got older, had more trouble keeping up with modern developments and the way the world was changing and as a result got subtly but progressively more paranoid and nervy, until now I frequently find her believing (sometimes even *defending*) things she reads in it.

I've literally watched my mother turn from the person who turned me on to New Scientist (back when it was less of a tabloid) into someone who reads the Daily Mail, sees terrorists behind every corner and *actually believes* (for example) that ""gay marriage will corrupt the meaning of the word marriage"", or not only that [Muslims really cared about](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1322435/Cafe-owner-ordered-remove-extractor-fan-case-smell-frying-bacon-offends-passing-Muslims.html) the smell of pork coming from an extractor-fan ([correction](http://www.khilafah.com/index.php/news-watch/europe/10712-pcc-clears-mail-and-telegraph-for-publishing-prejudicial-anti-muslim-story)), but that that single incident - *even if true* - would have any kind of statistical or evidential weight when forming a mental picture of Muslims in general.

She's still intelligent and thoughtful, but now her experience (the source from where we all draw our opinions, and the axioms we use to reason from) of race-relations, homosexuality, politics and foreign affairs is formed almost entirely from tabloid Daily Mail lies and agitprop.  When pressed, most of the stories or examples she gives are from the Daily Mail, and most are provably false.  Sadly, that means that no matter how smart she is, she can't easily spot the fallacies and inaccuracies that she's ingesting because she's existing largely in an current-events intellectual monoculture.

Worse, because it's such a habit to read it now (and she obviously [identifies as](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html) ""a Daily Mail reader""), even when you point out how horrifyingly inaccurate the DM is, she tends to hand-wave away the examples as exceptions rather than the rule, or accepts its unreliability but claims she doesn't *really believe* what she reads... even seconds after she's just offered a DM-sourced claim as the truth.  Push her on the issue and she just [gets irritable and tries to back out of the conversation](http://philosophtly.blogspot.com/2009/07/cognitive-dissonance.html).

It's like watching someone walk a little bit of shit into their house on their shoes every day.  Each quantity is tiny, and has little over-all effect, but after several years of it *every room in the house is knee-deep in shit*.  And worse, creeping normalcy prevents them from realising that being knee-deep shit is a bad situation, and hence taking action to clear it out and return the house to a sanitary state.

She's a highly intelligent woman, and she clearly doesn't *think* of herself as ""someone who believes what they read in the Daily Mail"".  However, sadly, brainwashing works *precisely by* sneaking around and under your expectations, and altering your opinions and attitudes not with obvious, conscious, rational argument, but by slow, gradual, repeated, cumulative poisoning of [the reserve of experiences available to you](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic) when forming opinions.

The only good thing I can say about the Daily Mail is that - through the effect it's had on those I love - it's really brought home to me the concept and importance of informational hygiene - making a conscious effort to draw news and information from numerous different sources, compare and contrast them, and never, ever, *ever* allow yourself to get trapped in an informational monoculture.",1426736319,,c1f62fr,33,unitedkingdom,0,Shaper_pmp,True,t3_fdqtn,

The [Georgia Guidestones]( http://www.infowars.com/articles/nwo/occult_dismantling_georgia_guidestones.htm) are also a clue in this (1. maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature). Some well prepared rich guys would hide in their bunker meanwhile a war on humanity is going on outside. After the war is ended they would come back get the seeds from the [Artic Seed Vault in Island]( http://www.articlesextra.com/arctic-seed-vault-svalbard.htm) and restart the world with a lot fewer needless eaters and they would build huge mansions for each of them with the help of their slaves that they would control completely. It would be a better world for them.

On the other hand it is also possible that people begin to realize what those occult groups are starting and who the puppet masters are. Then you would see some wealthy men hanging upside down, like Mussonlini did, in market-places all over the world. There would be some lynching of Bilderberg members. CFR, UNO, UNICEF, Trilateral Commission, Club of Rome and other Round Tables, EU, IMF, WHO, the central bank system and all the other globalist groups will be destroyed completely. There would be no family member left of the Rothschild, Rockefeller or Habsburgs families.  And afterward the political structures would change significantly and new criminals would arise to power. But there would be no billions of dead people. Some Satanists will be somehow really disappointed about that outcome, but most of the people would revise history and ask themselves how this could have gone so far, like the Germans did after the war was ended.",1426736373,,c1f66ky,3,conspiracy,0,GuiltByAssociation,False,t3_fd9co,

Hyperbolic nonsense.  

What we're going to see is that not only are many of the assumptions you start off from demonstratively false; you also have a real need to supplant compassion.

&gt;Frankly I find it condescending that you seem to think those who are less well off than yourself are incapable of providing an education for their children.

Then you're about to find this really condescending then; how can you be so ignorant as to not know that there haven't always been state schools, and that in what must be a terribly sheltered and naive existence you don't think there are places where it's going on now.  That 20% of the world's children go without regular education and this does work to limit, restrict and keep them impoverished. Know what happens when state education is introduced?  Literacy rates rise.  Parents don't have to necessarily take up on it but you jut ask a poor person if they want more expense or to take more timeout of their potential working day.  You can still go public, be  home-schooled, private, whatever but a state education establishes a bar to which all are entitled.  Your way, beyond pixie dust and law of the jungle, there is no bar.  You're advocating the strong get stronger on the backs of the disadvantaged.  You don't get to invoke compassion anymore: you've just spent all credibility in that department.  Is Vjijay compassionate?  You might as well have said you knew 'Buzz Aldrin' for all its relevance, but you're advocating the equivalent of a fat Dickensian sat gorging at a vast banquet table in front of the workhouse poor and hungry, trying to explain to them that it's only out of your respect for their right to feed themselves that you don't share the food, but to cheer up because the man at the next banquet maybe more altruistic.

The US health system is broke, but when you claim that people don't shop around unless it's their own money then you're palpably wrong.  The exact principle is illuminated in comparative education; parents absolutely shop around for the best schools with the best reputations, head-teachers absolutely shop around for the best teachers,  parents often move their entire lives and homes in shopping around for a good state school.  Of course people shop around even when it's not their own money:  because it's their own health or children!  

The argument of not 'shopping around' can only be made out of sheer ignorance.  Take the UK, the NHS not only shops around themselves, people entitled to the NHS are also free to use their NHS pounds to shop around anywhere in the EU too.  That's right, a person needing an operation in the UK can not only shop around in the UK for themselves, choose to go with the NHS who will have shopped around t provide their best service, or go and take their cost to the NHS and spend the equivalent or less on any other EU country's system if they think they can get a better job done.  They can even augment it.  At every level their is shopping around.  Doctors absolutely shop around too.  That's why there are pharmaceutical reps and salespeople.    All with an incentive of controlling costs: something you say doesn't exist.

&gt;or lose your customers and go bankrupt.

Here's *my* chance to show my compassion: I genuinely feel sorry for you.  Everything you have written, as erroneous and false and flawed as much as it is, has had a central theme: that theme is you insist on reducing everything down to a dollar sign.

You argue to a point of the ultimate hospital knobkierrie being bankruptcy or losing customers.  I personally would want the ultimate hitting stick for a hospital or doctor to be a professional medical board; not how effectively they can run the air of a reputable business or how many 'customers' die on the table or are fortunate enough to hobble out and not return.  It's too late; the argument that malpractice after malpractice should be allowed whilst there's at least one neon light still working outside is shocking.   You talk of compassion and then reduce everything down to dollars.   I'm so very sorry but it actually looks like you're trying to express something you struggle to grasp in units that don't convert.

There is one market that  is so open, with its social provision programs so limited, to be a close proxy to a free-market in the US and we can look on that as an eyeglass through which one  can observe this 'law of the jungle' approach you endorse.  The world of law: legal defense, prosecution and litigation.  It is a transparent truth that not only does it create costs to rise in sectors well outside its own courtrooms, but that the law is not distributed fairly as it was intended with all men being equal.  Legal representation, so vast is the disparity in social provision, is as free a market as there is and yet shyster lawyers continue to exist and make profits, indeed they've even created counter-litigation environments with more and more costs; all the while the less well off routinely feeling the brunt.  Charlie Sheen beats up a hooker after sinking a college fund in Columbian white and its a joke at the Globes but America's prisons are full of people serving years for having a spliff.

US Libertarianism has long been a hijacking of the term: the very antithesis of equality and liberty, one that corrupts political thought for an economic model.

Actually it does. It's called ""primary preventive medicine"" and it's a **huge** part of European medicine, and almost nonexistent in the US.

&gt; I don't think you're saying that, so what are you saying?

Of course.

&gt;but I do think that there is a large population of reasonable thinkers that contribute. Unfortunately, there is no way for me to show that to you.

It's hard to debate this since the very notion of what constitutes a reasonable thinker is very debatable. As an example, there are people that are blunt, rude and border on trolling that raise valid arguments, so the form isn't attached to the content.

&gt;Putting our biases aside, an atheists saying ""Darwin rules"" is no different than a Christian saying ""Praise Jesus.""

Well, yes, but be careful: saying it like that would prompt some to use the ""but atheism is also a religion LOL"" argument. I wouldn't put belief in Evolution at the same level as belief in Jesus, that's a poised argument that gives birth to stuff like ""but it's just a theory"" or ""it's also a form of belief"".

Having said that, as I said several times every human being is capable of embarking in blind following, be it in the name of religion (a common theme), ideology or even much more down-to-earth topics as sports.

&gt;Surely you have heard Christians of lesser intellect say outrageous things about atheists

Indeed I have, which is why I also mentioned that many - if not most - of what passes as Christian forums are extremely poor in most aspects. The whole thing is a bit alien to me though since this sort of hostility towards atheists is something that I never encountered in Europe, at least the countries I know. This is why I noted that given the background of some posters I can understand some of the hostility.

&gt;This is the nature of any community.

I agree. I do think, however, than in purely reddit terms /r/Christianity is generally much less hostile than /r/atheism, and actually shows a wider variety of opinions and debates (of a different nature, of course). This could very well be something completely limited to reddit.

&gt;The accusations you make about /r/atheism can be applied to any forum, including /r/christianity.

In my opinion, much less so.

&gt;My experiences in /r/atheism has revealed a large population of reasonable thinkers, from whom I have acquired a vast reserve of information.

Then it's useful for you. I also visit /r/atheism and I find some of the discussions interesting and engaging, others less so. What I mainly criticise is the often displayed inability to go a bit beyond established beliefs.

In accordance to the Rambouillet Agreement, Kosovo would have been to schedule a referendum and legally declare independence in back in 2002, while even the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had still existed. The only conflict would lie on the relation between Kosovo and its minorities, who would have been devastated had Belgrade betrayed them by accepting the Ultimatum at Rambouillet back in 1999, also refusing to accept an independent Kosovo. A number of individuals on the Albanian side, too, would want an ethnically clean Albanian Kosovo, of course, and surely would've further fueled the conflict; but Serbia or Yugoslavia could do little there, but *lodge official protests with the international community*. 

With all due your respect (and I have no intention to bring your personal observations into question), those are your personal observations and not a statistical analysis. AFAIK, foreign intelligence reports (and I don't mean Russian, but German) have commended the Serbian authorities for attempting to reintegrate the Albanian minority into the society. The *Milosevic-Rugova agreement* had restored the Albanian language into the education system and had began developing the self-government of the autonomous province, scheduling even (the first) free elections to be held. Let me quote German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer:

*With an agreement made with the Serbian leadership at the end of 1998 [..] both the security situation and the conditions of life of the Albanian-derived population have noticeably improved [..] Specifically in the larger cities public life has since returned to relative normality.*

I am not offended; but I am calling upon clear sources in here. The KLA didn't like the fact that the situation in Kosovo was normalizing, hence it *violated the peace treaty* signed with the Yugo-Serb forces, in an attempt to destabilize Kosovo, Serbia and all of Yugoslavia. And this is not something I claim, but is universally-accepted. According to the NATO, the very organization that had conducted the bombing campaign, the KLA was *the main initiator of the violence* and that it had *launched what appears to be a deliberate campaign of provocation*. 

The statement I had written is not totally untrue, because data speaks otherwise. The US Committee for Refugees has noted that the KLA had conducted ethnic cleansing of Serbs from Kosovo. Serbs were expelled from *all* mixed settlements with a mixed population under KLA control - the international organizations have documented that over 55,000 non-Albanian residents had fled from Kosovo, and in specific, 90 villages which were mixed had become ethnically solely Albanian-inhabited. This had *not* occurred in settlements under official state control and Albanians did *not* flee the mixed settlements that were not under KLA control. This is a fact. 

The *Serbian individuals and the Serb side has been indicted only and specifically for the atrocities committed in 1999*. The very first documented one being, the Racak incident in the beginning of '99. However, *the KLA-perpetrated crimes predate this, occurring in 1998 and prior*. In 2005, the ICTY has found **Haradin Bala** guilty for his actions throughout 1998 and sentenced him to 13 years of prison. Let me also remind you that a prominent Kosovo Albanian leader (former PM) and KLA commander, **Ramush Haradinaj**, is currently on trial at the Hague Tribunal for alleged crimes committed in 1998. I have no intention of predicting the outcome of his trial, but should he get convicted, that will only further confirm what I am explaining here. And yes, I am limiting myself to the war-time period - the period which is under the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, from late 1991 to mid-1999. 

As for the usage *terrorist* - it was described that way, both domestically and by the international community, including by KLA's subsequent Western allies. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has passed a Resolution of Dick Marty, approving his report, becoming the first official international document which specifically mentions KLA's actions as *terrorist activity* (the UN documents had previously ""condemned all terrorist activity by the KLA and other factors in Kosovo"", which is considerably softened up by mentioning *and other*, not naming the KLA exclusively).

If you want to study in Europe you *need* an MSc first - unless you are exceptionally good and have publications already. A European PhD is three years (usually stretches to a bit more) and a two year MSc is considered a prerequisite.

In the US, ""graduate school"" is the equivalent of an MSc+PhD in Europe. I.e., you do four to five years and end up with a PhD, and possibly an MSc in some cases. So, if you go to the US - do not do an MSc, as you will then need to repeat a lot of it in courses for the first two years of gradschool.

Ultimately though, a PhD is something you should really only do if you want to do research afterwards. It is just the first step in that career. A PhD will for example *not* give you more job options or higher salary in Iceland (although it might elsewhere). An MSc in most cases will though.

In the US we have a weird system, which by now shouldn't surprise anyone. Depending on the type of restaurant, you're expected to tip, and you have to be immersed in our culture to be able to figure out what kind of food gets a tip. And the waitstaff is paid less than minimum wage with the expectation that they'll make it up in tips.

""But that's not fair!"" and ""The menu should say how much the meal actually is!"" are absolutely right. **However, dicking over someone making less than minimum wage is not the way to change the system.** People opposed to the tipping system's activism seems to begin and end with not leaving a tip, I don't see a lot of them out there campaigning for a reform of minimum wage laws.",1426736971,,c1f7gpi,418,self,0,georgehotelling,False,t3_fdy1t,

I'm assuming the OP is from a country other than the United States.  As far as I can tell the U.S. seems to have a unique ""gun culture"" that is confusing to foreigners. This, in my opinion, stems from a much broader ""culture of individualism"" that is unique to the United States in the developed west.  This comment I'm replying to (&amp; others) demonstrates the typical European position to be dependent on the police for protection; something many Americans find offensive. Throughout other comments the OP has asked questions like: 
&gt;Is not the most reasonable precaution not opening the door? Rather than bringing a loaded gun to the door and risking possible confrontation?

Or:

&gt;Surely you cannot believe this situation is safer if both parties had loaded guns?

This, in my mind, reveals that the OP's moral imperative is for the most safety for the most people possible.  In a word: Egalitarian.  I know it's confusing but many Americans simply don't think like this.  The Egalitarian is more concerned with outcomes, whereas many Americans (our moral philosophy hasn't really been typecast) are more concerned with principles.  One sees the potential problems that might arise when people own (and, as naturally follows, use) firearms, and decides it's in everyone's best interest if we just wait and let the cops handle it.  The other knows that exercising their rights in a free society is oftentimes messy, but would rather die than let those rights be subverted by the government.  It doesn't matter if crime rates go down or quality of life improves, Americans generally choose the tougher, freer, action because its the principle that matters, not the outcome.  (Obviously there are wide sections of U.S. policy where this doesn't apply: Drugs are the first glaring example) Side Note: Our health care debate makes more sense if you understand this American attitude about rights and principles vs. outcomes.

What we are dealing with is a difference in culture.  Gun ownership, self preservation, rugged individualism, and mistrust of the authorities are very strong themes running through American culture that don't exist, or exists to a much lesser extent, in the rest of the western world.  Much of it has to do with the westward expansion and the ""wild west"" and so forth.  Europeans have Kings and courts and knights to look back on for their history/mythology; while Americans have cowboys and sheriffs and gunslingers.  ""A Man and His Gun"" is a theme that is intimately and uniquely American.

Will this be a major story?  Sure, but nowhere as big as a regime change in Iran 2 years ago would have been.  Egypt isn't a totalitarian state on the same level as even Saudi Arabia is, and while momentum is building in many nations in the region for similar protest, the nations that truly need it wont see it (Iran, Syria, Libya).  This will be an a slightly smaller scale as the civil war in Lebanon in the late 70s through the 80s.  There will be a change in government certainly, but by and large there will not be a massive change in Egypt.

After a year of ""secular college,"" I turned my life totally to my faith and went to (an unacredited) bible college - so that I could study god's word with everything I had.  I actually had to appeal to the dean to take one of the ""upper level"" classes called Hermeneutics - in which you translate the ""original texts"" of the bible.  Our job was to translate I John from the Koine Greek.  We had to study each word in classical Greek, then how other authors of the day used the word, how that word was used within the bible, how that author used the word and sentence diagrams and yeah, you get the idea.

So basically, I hit a wall.  The bible said very specifically that ""if you ever sin it means you have never known Christ.""  He could have used other, vaguer Greek words.  He didn't.  This went against my beliefs so I studied harder.  And I found even more glaring errors (trying to reconcile what heppened on the day Christ rose from the dead was like a mental breakdown.)  

I decided I was being ""proud"" and relying on my intellect.  Christians aren't supposed to do that - but to come to him ""as little children.""  So I turned off my thinking and turned to blind faith.  I locked myself in a closet every night (so my mind wouldn't wander) and poured out my heart to god.

Still, my faith ran galloping away.  Heart-broken, I left the school.  The dean of students was kind enough to insist to the other students it was because of a moral failing - clearly I was bonking my boyfriend (and I really was a virgin, despite her assurances).

I was a bit lost for a few years.  Worked as a newspaper photographer, went to Europe.  Realized that to get ahead in life I'd need an education at a real university, so applied and got in!  Did quite well - Dean's List and all of that.  And I started finding out about anthropology, biology, history.  And, my favorite, philosophy!  So many things my Christian family had sheltered me from were now wide-open.

From my original bible college fundy girl ""this doesn't make sense"" to ""hey, I'm an atheist!"" was a period of about 7 years.

What I didn't anticipate:  that life could be so full of joy without a god!  I have literally woken up weeping, realizing that there is no thought, no area of knowledge that is ""off limits"" to me anymore.  That I will die not knowing all there is to know.  It's absolutely humbling and amazing.

Problems I faced:  I think most conversion stories will agree that it's ""hurting your family.""  I lied for a while.  Tried to find a way to help them see that my rejection of faith wasn't a rejection of them, or morality or anything like that.  One sibling won't let nonchristians around her children - which is a problem, and she constantly evangelizes mine.

Anybody who's been to Western Europe can attest that menu prices are typically far higher than the prices commonly found in the U.S.  For example, when I was in Paris it was typical to see prices of 4 euro for a 250ml glass of coke (with no refills) whereas in the U.S. a glass of coke would be $2 for 500ml with unlimited refills.

Anyway my dad isn't too keen on driving there and back at the busiest time of the year and he's a quite fond of trains so we take the Apple express to get to the beach. The apple express is an old restored steam train that does these small little trips from the suburbs to the beach and back on occasions like this.

There were many times that I nailed a table and did not receive a tip. It sucks. But that is just part of the job. It does not entitle you to confront the party and embarrass a PAYING CUSTOMER about being a cheapskate.

I served tables in Niagara Falls NY for many years as a college student. The city is right on the Canadian border. In Canada tipping is not necessarily customary (though I understand this has changed a bit). I would get a lot of Canadian customers - most of which did not tip, and when they did, it was usually the loose change out of their pocket. I did not confront every one of them and act like a whiny bitch. I thanked them for coming in and went on to the next table with a smile on my face in hopes they would tip well. 

What it boils down to is that OP is in the wrong line of work. If he wants a guaranteed paycheck, he needs to get an hourly or salaried position. Otherwise, OP, just do job the best you can and stop whining about getting stiffed on a tip. 

That said, the tipping system is a good system. It encourages good service from servers. I lived in Europe for 4 years while in the military and I commonly experienced poor service. I also experienced a much higher bill to cover the costs of paying servers higher wages - even when I received shitty service.",1426737365,,c1f8b4x,1,self,0,KorgRue,True,t3_fdy1t,

In America it's *extremely* common for rude foreigners to purposely not leave a tip because they think the waitstaff will assume they are ignorant of American customs.  They talk loudly in foreign languages to get the point across that they're not local and then skip out on the tip because they think they can get away with it.

Every waiter *loathes* having to serve foreigners for this very reason, since arguing with a tourist that may or may not understand you about the fact that it's a custom to leave a tip is essentially fruitless (and even more frustrating when you realize they probably already knew and were just trying to cheat you).

And even if some well-meaning tourists truly are ignorant of American customs, I still have a problem.  When you travel to a foreign country, it's general practice to read some sort of travel guide or bone up on common customs before leaving, and somewhere near the front of every single guide for the USA is an explanation of the fact that if you are waited on in a restaurant, it is *expected* that you tip according to the quality of service you received.

1 - What do I do when someone gives me a horrible service or gives me attitude? I have had orders forgotten/mixed up, waiting for 30 minutes before someone shows up, attitude about getting me a sauce, food but no silverware, etc. and I have still left 15% percent tip.
2 - I agree to the tipping etiquette of a small restaurant but what about over-priced where a typical meal can cost you $100 or more per person? Isn't there something wrong with the owners of these restaurants who make a lot of money on meals/overheads and still don't pay their  employees well?
3 - What about buffet or self service places?
4 - What about typical restaurants (a lot of Thai restaurants) where 1 or 2 people take care of 10-15 tables?

I don't mind tipping but do feel bad for making it a necessity. Why can't they just add a 10% to the food price and let the rest be voluntary?

Consider the other extreme - Japan - where there are no tips.

Europe has almost the same price of food, and still tips are voluntary.

Our CSA produces a small amount at such high costs, that bread and flour is only practical as a winter treat.

What research I've been able to do so far suggests that I might manage 60 bushels an acre in good years. That's 3600 pounds. Some amish have managed to do this with non-Roundup varieties (probably hybrid, but not GM) using only hog manure.

Bad years would be as little as 10-15 bushels. Really bad ones might leave nothing. But, keep some in reserve for seed even next year, should the current year's harvest leave none, and I think I'd be ok. It's overproduction, of course, but I can always sell or even give away the excess (wondering if it could be donated to food banks and the like).

It's just a little much to do by hand. If I cut it to 1/8th acre, it's doable by hand, though still quite a few hours. But without the surplus if I get zero yield and have no current seed.

I haven't tried this, and the only way to know is experimenting. I'm 5 years away from being able to do this. But wheat's not the only grain... you probably would want barley or maybe even rice and oats. Hell, I'm thinking sunflowers for cooking oil (canola probably wouldn't do well here). So, an acre or half acre of each of those is in order, and I don't think I can have the variety without a tractor. But maybe I'm missing something, and it's not possible anyway.

I want my kid growing up knowing what oatmeal is, dammit. I might want to brew beer. These things shouldn't be exotic, once-in-a-lifetime foods.

&gt; Aren't there plenty of other forms of flour/carbs that people lived on for 10, 000s of years before 'civilization' kicked in 2-5 thousand years ago?

From what I've read, hunter gatherers in Europe probably only ever knew chestnuts as carbs. Honey was a rare treat (well, at least keeping a few hives isn't work intensive). In the Americas, chestnuts were available too, but some corn flour. Some acorn. Still, meat pretty much took over in the diet.

&gt; I understand this is so ridiculously relative... we're southern Maine, fyi. So literally incorporating our terraces into the woods around us, is completely off-mark from any flatland farming, or more productive southern practices, that.. I'm starting to feel mute here.

Do you like it there? I'm not sure I would, too damned cold here, and I'm in Texas (getting down to -20 tonight). But if you like it, I don't think it limits you. I don't think that your region changes things significantly, you won't be growing any tropical crops, but then neither will I. Most of what I've said should apply to you as well as it does me. I know that some canola is grown up there, at least. Some wheat too, small scale (remember, that stuff is grown in Montana, the Dakotas so the winters aren't going to limit you). 

You're probably more limited by acreage than anything. Wheat doesn't need to be grown on flat land, check out youtube sometime. They'll grow that stuff on up to what you'd think were scary grades, say 30 degrees, maybe 40. So if you could clear or have clear even hilly stuff, shouldn't be out of the question. Most of that is done with more modern combines (that tilt the angle of the harvesting head roller thingy as opposed to the), but I'm pretty sure some of the older stuff is capable as well.

* Canned whole plum tomatoes (maybe some San Marzano for certain dishes)

There's plenty of other finishing salts like Maldon, Fleur de Sel, etc. but I like the colour of the grey salt, how it has an almost wet feel to it, and the variation in grain size (big crunchy crystals all the way down to smaller crystals like in kosher salt)
* Rice - Risotto rice (I like carnaroli but arborio works just fine too), paella rice (Bomba is king but regular ""paella"" rice from Spain works well too and is cheaper; risotto rice works in a paella but doesn't absorb as much liquid as Spanish rice and real paella rice doesn't go mushy easily), basmati rice
* Dried beans/legumes - Great Northern beans, canellini beans, chick peas, Puy lentils, beluga lentils
* Spices - Smoked paprika (both hot and sweet-- go for the real stuff from Spain), star anise, cardamom, cumin seeds, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, black pepper, cayenne pepper, cloves, whole nutmeg, saffron (still haven't decided on a favourite between Spanish and Indian; they're both good), cinnamon (Saigon is my favourite), red chile flakes, some sort of chile powders (I like ancho and chipotle but there's lots more to try still), ground ginger, Ras el Hanout, black mustard seeds, black cumin, turmeric, garam masala

2) When the US wanted Afghanistani Taliban government to hand over Bin Laden, the Taliban government asked for proof of his involvement, just like any other government would. The US, using the umbrella of NATO, decided it would be better suited to invade afghanistan.

3) The initial reasons given were not 'spreading democracy' or any other fancy verbiage which US politicians adopted much later.

4) Africa has never been the focus of much US attention because it's just not an oil rich area. The humanitarian armed forces did little to stop the genocide in rwanda or the mass murder perpetrated in Sudan by the Janjaweed militia where entire sections of the population were razed down.

5) You mention that afghanistan does not have any allied nation in the region powerful enough to prevent an incursion from neighbouring countries or to supply troops.

Tell me, which neighbour has invaded afghanistan in it's entire history?
It's two principal neighbours are Pakistan on the east and iran on the west - and neither has shown much interest in afghanistan. The few incursions that happen every day are from the native hill tribes who have been there for centuries and they really don't know a damn about borders etc. 

The major countries which have invaded aghanistan are the UK, during colonial periods, the Soviet Union, and now under the guise of NATO, the US.

6) You mention that Afghanistan was a democratic country with a strong western bent. Are you seriously calling the taliban a democratic government with a western bent. They were the ones in power when the US decided to invade aghanistan. If you go through the entire history of afghanistan after its independence, you will find that there has never been a democracy. It's basically a very poor country which is fundamentally  driven along tribal lines and loyalties, and its governing structure during different periods reflected that.

7) And calling african countries as rotton, is beside the point. I agree that most african countries do not have a stable democratic tradition. Isn't this even more important for the west to help them estabilish stable institutions? After all, the whole of europe were all over themselves during the last few centuries, trying to rape the continent under the guise of the slave trade?

Take me for example.  In my ideal world, I would:

* Implement a single-payer universal health care system (Costing $600 billion/year)

* Withdraw 2/3 of our troops from Europe/Japan, all of our troops from the Middle East, and cut 2/3 of our military weapons procurement and development budgets. (Saving $600 billion/year)

* Make our tax code radically more simple and progressive.  Eliminate deductions, tax financial transactions, eliminate taxes on the poorest and raise taxes on the rich and estates, and implement a gas tax, carbon tax or cap-and-trade system. (Raising revenues $1.2 trillion/year)

That would basically fix our deficit problem.

L'Internet réussi par la multitude des voix, la multitude des fournisseurs d'hébergement et la multitude des format d'accès Internet.

Un accès unique serait restrictif par défaut.

Voici quelques examples:

- Rogers, en Ontario, bloquent les port 25 et 26 en sortit ce qui empêche d'envoyer des courriels via un serveur SMTP externe, ce qui peut souvent être essentiel. Je pense notament aux systêmes de gestion de spam qui reçoivent des directives via SMTP. Comment contourner?  Changer de fournisseur.

- Vidéotron (comme d'autres ISP), pour gérer l'entrée de spam, limite la vitesse de connection en entrée pour ses serveurs SMTP de réception. Plus le nombre de courriel en provenance d'un serveur est jugé comme étant du spam. Si nous avons un seul fournisseur, il devient possible que le Québec au complet soit bloqué à cause de quelques spammers Québecois.

- Plusieurs fournisseurs bloquent le port 80 pour éviter que leurs clients ait des serveurs HTTP à la maison. Mais nombreux routeurs ont un module de gestion sur le port 80 pour permettre à un usager de gérer son routeur à distance.

- Globetrotter, il y a 5 ans, on eu un bug majeur dans leur serveur DNS et pendant une période de 3 jours, aucune propagation de DNS n'était possible. Imaginons une telle panne à la grandeur de la province.

- Rogers (encore eu), on décidé il y a 3 ans de hijacker les serveurs DNS pour fournir des avertissements de dépassement de bande passante lors de visite de site Internet. Celà signifie que des requêtes SOAP ont été brisée par la modification de la communication. Imaginons une entreprise utilisant ces requêtes pour effectuer des transactions par carte de crédit. La requête est acceptée par leur banque, mais la réponse est modifiée par Rogers et celà brise la communication

- Je suis déménagé il y a 8 ans dans une maison nouvellement construite sur une nouvelle rue. J'étais le SEUL à 500 mêtres à la ronde. J'ai du attendre 4 mois pour une connection Vidéotron et 2 mois pour une connection haute vitesse de Bell. Qu'est-ce que j'ai fait? J'ai utiliser look.ca (maintenant défunt) qui envoyait le signal via une connection directe depuis le mont-royal jusqu'à ce que Vidéotron arrive 6 mois plus tard avec 2 mois de retard.

Look a vécu pendant plusieurs années grâce à une technologie révolutionnaire qu'un fournisseur unique n'aurait jamais lancé.

I will say however, that it is brave, even if misguided. Brave because ""anonymous"" is walking a very thin line here. A thin line between keeping and destroying the very ideals they want to stand for: equality, democracy, and freedom.

How can we both have anonymity AND transparency? Anonymity is the opposite of transparency. At least own up to an ideal of privacy and closed doors, not transparency. If you want to call for transparency, as I do, be transparent like me and come out of your anonymity.

If we are truly going to fight the politics that plague us, that deserve change, it should not be done with scare tactics, veiled warnings and threats or ominous predictions... It should instead be done by giving a voice to those willing to put their name on the line. We should look to Ghandi, not Egypt, because I have news for you, as exciting the events in Egypt are today, they will not have democracy, they will have either a military autocracy or a ""populist"" religious pseudo-democratic oligarchy, similar to Iran. 

The revolution RFK was talking about is not this revolution, obviously. He was probably referring to the problems of what eventually came upon the Democratic national convention and perhaps as well the attempted French revolution of 68. And this revolution is still very much alive today in the thoughts and minds of European intellectuals. Except, it is no longer a violent overthrow of government as we see in Egypt, nor is it political demonstration at all. It is, instead, an objective, philosophical thought, born out of the death of the enlightenment that has only recently entered into Anglo-American discourse. The ideas of Derrida, Badiou, Lyotard, etc. Thus, a revolution, other than that of the peaceful kind, is not possible- as shown in 68.

If you stopped being religious you no longer considered yourself Jewish. 

In the 19th century a secular revolution was sweeping Europe. Many Jews were caught up in it and started the ""[Haskalah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskalah)"" or ""Enlightenment"" movement. They started the idea that being Jewish means sharing a culture and language and not necessarily a religion. 

In the midst of all of that, people stopped identifying as Jews. A group of people got together to rectify that problem and start the [Zionist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Zionism) movement based on Marxist principles. This basically was a movement that sought to unite Jews of the world under one nationality. Now, if you are following, you will notice that the entire purpose of Zionism was to *break away from religion*.

A follower of this movement was a guy named [Theodor Herzl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Herzl), a very outspoken Atheist. He realized that, despite the fact that the majority of European Jews no longer followed the Jewish religion, there was still anti-Semitism. So he decided to try to convince all the Jewish leaders to convert to Christianity. When that wasn't received well, he came upon the idea of moving all Jews to their own [country where they will not be bothered](http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history/Modern_History/1700-1914/Zionism/Theodor_Herzl/The_Jewish_State.shtml). Originally that country was a toss up between Argentine, [Uganda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Uganda_Programme) and Palestine. The First Zionist Congress eventually settled on Palestine for numerous reasons, mostly political. (There were already many Jews living there, it was easier to convince the religious Jews to join their cause, etc.). This entire time the only response from the religious communities was one of [overwhelming hostility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edah_HaChareidis). It was only after WWII and the [Sephardi Exodus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exodus_of_Jews_from_Arab_lands), where 90% of the worlds Jews were literally left without a home, that people moved to the newly formed Israel en-masse and supported the Zionist government.

So you see, Zionism is not a religious movement. And it never was. You cannot equate criticism of Zionism with criticism of the Jewish religion as they are very separate.

As for the ""98% racist"" comment, that's merely my perspective. I rarely see a legitimate critique of the Jewish religion that is not flamboyantly racist and anti-semitic. The exceptions are, of course, when in discussion of criticism of religion as a whole, like in Dawkins or Hitchens books.",1426739051,,c1fbr9j,2,atheism,0,Yserbius,False,t3_fdzig,

so it's because i don't ""understand"" American culture that i don't tip, you really want to presume to tell me my own reasons for acting against your wishes?  

why don't you boneheads realise that your coping mechanism is broken: we don't choose not to tip because we're ignorant of your culture, we choose not to because we disagree. why do you people have this ""we can't be wrong"" mentality?  

i've traveled the world jackass and was born in the UK, as well has hitting Asia and the rest of Europe, currently living in Australia. America is practically the only country that has this stupidly acceptable restaurant  slavery culture. i've worked as staff and worked my way up to manager in restaurants, movie theaters, call-centers, security, night clubs, gyms, and many more places in different countries.   

not once did i believe i was entitled to anything more than my wage i accepted according to my job description. bonuses are nice, but they're not standard and you shouldn't get used to them if you want to lve within your means. 

&gt;...you are supposed to tip  

supposed to, necessary, standard or desired  ? what i see as an option you seem to see it as a right or a law. it's not.  

i'm acting on my option to not tip, if you don't like it, address the people that make the option available.  

see maybe it's because the USA had a too much of a reign og boneheads like the Bush's and Reagans that left the country $12 trillion in debt, maybe it's because there are too many dumbasses that think they can't get a better job, maybe it's because there are too many crackheads that think the bonhead presidents are smarter than them....  

but above all, maybe it's because you expect other people to bail you out of your won mess because you hate successful people.  either way, if i have the option of tipping for surprisingly good service, i'll happy reciprocate, but what i won't do it compensate you for the lifestyle you don't have because you choose to live in an abusive system that promotes slavery.  

so you see, maybe you have too much American influence pumped into you such that you deem it acceptable to work for $2/hr. maybe you accept this abusive slavery while berating smarter and more successful people who refused to live under those conditions.

I could probably find a lot more examples, but here's a [German company searching for  a Chinese buyer for their cullet.](http://www.recyclechina.com/companyInfo/details12636.htm)

That's the kind of shit that's going on. Here in California, there's a system to deal with E waste  similar to European systems, but like the systems in Europe, it's energy intensive, and nasties from it are  still getting exported to the developed world where the recycling of it causes widespread pollution, or toxics  are simply sequestered by toxic waste disposal companies. 

I'm in favor of simply forcing everyone to sort and either deliver their own waste, or stockpile it until it's cost effective to pick it up. Many large companies already do that, and Cash refund systems already have folks delivering their recyclables to the shopping centers where we all have to go anyway.

For things that are hard to deal with, like E waste, mandate that it be properly sorted and stockpiled until a cost efficient way to recycle them can be used. For now, it's broken down here in the states and in Europe, but it's still getting exported, and some of the toxics, like CRT cullet and phosphors aren't always getting recycled. [Here's another German company seeking buyers for E waste.](http://www.alibaba.com/member/de102094850.html) Note in the link that they're trying to get rid of scrap circuit boards and everything else to South America,
Eastern Europe,
Southeast Asia,
Africa,
Oceania,
Mid East,
Eastern Asia,
Western Europe -
Export Percentage: 	81% - 90%  

Efficient recycling has long been  done where waste can be easily sorted and stockpiled. Cardboard has enough value, that most places that generate a lot of cardboard bale it, stockpile it, and recycling companies *pay them* for it. 

It's done with used cooking oils and fats. If I wasn't getting paid for my used cooking oil at my restaurant, I was at least getting it picked up for free, and had a special container provided to me for free by the company that picked it up.

Nearly all companies that manufacture plastics find it cost effective to recycle their own waste plastics.

Just about any kind of waste can have great value if properly sorted and in quantity. I see no problem with making people responsible for sorting their own waste and delivering it where they go to shop, or stockpiling it until they have enough where it's cost effective to have it picked up.

Palestinians revolted against the immigration and rioted against the Jews killing a number of them. In response the Jews formed paramilitary organizations to protect them because the British couldn't.

After WW2 Jewish holocaust survivors had nowhere to go in war torn Europe. Most of the time they had to stay in the concentration camps for years. Eventually they started immigrating to Palestine. The British tried and failed to stop mass immigration and a civil war began in Palestine. Jews and Arabs began to clash and eventually the UN intervened, deciding to partition the land.

It is a voluntary act with the exception of some establishments who choose to add a mandatory tip to large groups of 8 or more, which I personally disagree with but there are obvious reasons why some establishments choose to institute such a rule. 

In general terms, the server is tipped, by the customer, a percentage of the total bill based on perceived quality of service. 

The server is tipped a greater amount for serving lobster because tipping is based on percentage of the total bill, and therefore, since lobster costs more than a sandwich the total bill, and thus, the percentage will be greater.

While diet is a key factor, most weight problems could be significantly reduced with exercise. Due to the lower population density of the U.S. than say Europe, we are much more reliant on vehicles for transportation and I believe both of us could agree that someone who walks or bikes to their daily activities is less likely to be overweight. Exercising is free, is commonly known to improve health and BMI, and is extremely important in a healthy lifestyle. We find however with the overwhelming healthcare costs related to obesity that even with the knowledge of the power of exercise that we would rather have all aspects of health decline than run for 30 minutes a day.

**Regarding ill-begotten land:** You're touching upon a very sensitive, complex issue here that's extremely difficult to sum up efficiently. However, I'll try to construct a timeline for you based upon what I know:

* **Palestine, 1500s-1880s:** Under Ottoman rule, mostly settled by Arabs; however, there are Jews living in several places around the Galillee area and in the four holy cities: Tiberias, Jerusalem, Sephad and Hebron.

* **Palestine, roughly 1881-roughly 1914:** First and second waves of 'aliyah' occur. These immigrants arrived with money, with which they began purchasing land from local residents and establishing settlements upon it. By the eve of WWI there were Jewish settlements in pretty much every corner of Palestine.
* **1915-1916:** the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence occurs. Basically, the British were encouraging an Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire in an attempt to bring down a German ally. The Arabs were given a general promise that all lands which were at the time under Turkish rule would become independent and Arab - including Palestine.
* **2 November 1917:** The Balfour Declaration comes out. It reads:
&gt;""His Majesty's government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.""

Then when composing the Mandate they reiterated the idea in the preamble. And that's when shit began to hit the fan it's hitting to this very day.

**TL;DR:**

1. Prior to WWI, Arabs had absolutely no problem with Jews being/settling in Palestine.

2. Jews who came during the first and second 'aliyah' bought lands off Arabs fair and square. This as opposed to the normal behavior of European immigrants arriving in a new land: seizing it by force from the locals and then proceeding to brutally murder them - as it happened in America, Asia, Africa and Oceania.

3. The British are assholes :)
***
**Regarding equality:** Discrimination and racism certainly exist, but to a much lesser extent than you seem to think. We've never enslaved anyone and for the most part, Arabs *are* equal under Israeli law. It's illegal to deny an Arab any sort of service simply on the grounds that he or she isn't Jewish. They are not barred from any sort of institution in Israel - neither workplaces, nor schools nor any place of business.

Israelis, on the other hand, can't enter Palestinian territories for fear of ending up getting lynched. [This](http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=194152) is a recent example, and [tourists aren't safe either](http://www.nypost.com/p/news/international/american_tourist_stabbed_to_death_9tsjuNWMUIsjfK5w3Rwz6O).

Which brings me to the issue of starving an entire population: I really wish the IDF had some sort of a device that allowed them to separate the bad guys from the good guys so that innocent people wouldn't have to suffer, but unfortunately not such thing exists. You can't quite spare the [women](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okU0ZaSO6L8) and [children](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zkFZJB4ocY) either, seeing as there exist those among them who either participate in the violence or support it otherwise.

Terrorist organizations do not necessarily represent governments, ethnicities, or religious groups. My take on the whole issue is that most of the rest of the world thinks that the middle eastern conflict is not their business - for example, russia and china sell all kinds of shit to Iran and don't care how it gets used and most of western europe and the UN just wags their fingers at whoever's been naughty that day just so they could say they said something. If you want to implicate anyone in this, look to the governments who'd rather profit than encourage peace through the force of their weight in the international community. Jewish imperialism (crush your enemies, invade their lands) is not only impractical, but is abhorrently ignorant of the fact that not every arab is a terrorist. To characterize ALL Arabs as jew hating terrorists is to be WOEFULLY ignorant of the history of the Jewish presence in the middle east before WW2 and is just repugnant racism.

Now for the first issue - what do YOU recommend the ADL, SPLC etc. do? What is the JIDF doing that they aren't? Engaging in fights on message boards?

The flirting on the job, that shouldn't be a law that says you can flirt, but it shouldn't be allowed to be used to termination. There should be limits to what an employer can fire an employee for.

But why should the employer not be able to craft a policy of employee conduct if it feels that it benefits the company and its workers, and isn't some grand breach of human rights? Look, I can at least understand the arguments behind mandated breaks, etc. That's a basic human need. But when it comes to flirting, or other such behavior, why should that be beyond the reach? What conduct, in your opinion, would it be okay for WalMart to prohibit?

&gt;You are right though, that a lot of people are on a wishy-washy system of economic understanding. For example, in Ottawa, we have OC transpo as the public transit company. The bus drivers are known to be very impolite and have a very poor attitude. a year ago, they went on an almost 2 month strike because they want to be in charge of their own schedule and some other stupid things. They also make on average around 30 dollars/hour, which is ridiculous for driving a bus. That is a union gone overboard and I disagree with that.

So where is the dividing line between good union and bad union? What you just described is also a main reason behind the collapse of the American auto industry...the benefits that UAW union workers get would make any normal private-sector employee reel. But you go anywhere, and that's what union means. You go to New York City and you see union contractors laying around on the job. Look, I have no problem with voluntary independent unionization of employees, but when it gains the force of law behind it, that's where I draw the line. It's fundamentally destructive to the fabric of free enterprise. And your Ontario example is the ultimate result. So...again, where does one draw the line? The insidious nature of bureaucracy is for these kind of operations to continue growing and taking more power...and thus, even the best-intentioned unionization (I mean here: unionization with the official force the law behind them) can and probably will to some extent end up like the bus drivers in ontario, the auto workers in detroit, and the construction workers in Manhattan. You and I can sit here and make personal judgment about which unions are bad and which are good, but in the end, the problem with government-supported unions is fundamental. 

&gt;Walmart on the other hand, tries to control their employees more than an elementary school controls their students. I'm in Germany now, and here, workers have a lot of rights and employers seem to respect employees. The economy is obviously working since Germany is keep Europe afloat and employees are treated as humans (normally), not as children. Sometimes you get unfriendly and poor service, but generally it's ok.

That's specious reasoning, unless you can show me some kind of causative relationship between Germany's governmental controls over ""workers rights"", and their relatively healthy economy. ",1426739827,,c1fdf6i,1,business,0,ewilliam,False,t3_fdszs,

The last time I was in Bucharest I stayed at a hostel run by an Aussie guy. There were a few English lads there, and one night the owner took them out to a brothel. The first I heard about it was the next morning they're joking about how one of the lads got ""shortchanged"", and it turns out that one of the girls got upset halfway through the action and told the guy she was with how unhappy she was, cutting short his romp and leaving things unfinished.

He went back to the same brothel alone a couple of days later - I think he wanted a conscience-free experience with a different girl, but ended up with the same lass. He didn't get any action, he just spent his visit consoling her as she cried, and as he left she was on on her knees, holding on to his leg, telling him in her broken English what a nice guy he was (for not raping her!) and begging him to help her escape.

I don't know if I'm conveying this very well, because I don't remember any of the details. What do I remember is feeling the enormity of it at the time. I have an impression of this skinny girl covered in bruises being repeatedly raped, on a daily basis over a period of months.

This was less than 10 years ago, but as a foreigner in Bucharest at that time there was fuck all one could do about it. The cops there were (are?) surely all in the pay of the local mafia, and you'd be afraid that it would be *you* that would end up in jail if you tried to report this to the local authorities.

I don't know about Ukraine specifically, but I spent a month in Bulgaria - all over Bulgaria - a couple of years before that, and there are plenty of decent-sized towns over there that are like a concrete-themed middle-ages. I just can't really describe the pervasive poverty there - I mean, a donkey and cart is functional transport for plenty of families, and yet you get a hundred miles away to the big city and there are people driving around in Mercedes.

I get the impression that huge swathes of the Former Soviet Union (or the Republics?) are like that, too. I mean, Bulgaria's part of the EU now, and things might well be better in Bucharest (which is a capital city, and now offers smutty cam-girls to the world), but if so then the trade will have just moved back to the smaller cities. The poorer states adjacent will not be any nicer now than Bucharest was 7 or 8 years ago. I'm sure you could still find plenty of newspaper stories published in the last year or two about girls who were offered a job in the big city and ended up in prostitution, so this is probably pretty close to home for Ukrainian girls.

First, I'd argue that our tax burden is not particularly onerous. Not by comparison to other nations with similar costs, anyway. By costs, here, I mean our non-defense/security spending. I'll get to our military budget in a moment. Bear in mind, I'm only attacking your opinion regarding the measure of our taxes, not anything else, ok? 

Second, let go of the whole ""it ain't in the Constitution"" thing. Again, we're in a representational democracy. What's not in the Constitution amounts to a LOT of what we regulate in this nation. The fact that the Founders didn't think of it does not make it illegal or against their wishes for who we are as a nation. IF you insist that we MUST create amendments to create new powers (like single-payer), so be it... but you're only making the goalposts further away than they already are. 

Now... on to your greater points. 

&gt; We must end generational welfare.  

 I absolutely agree, almost without condition. In fact, my SOLE condition is that instead, we put these people to WORK. This was what Johnson wanted, back in the 30's. Free money has no value to the person receiving it, and is not spent wisely. And it creates the problems we now have with welfare programs and recipients. Take the residents of any housing projects and put them to work reclaiming slums. Teach them to clean, to build, to paint, to use a hammer and a saw, to lay bricks and mix cement. THEN watch what happens when a gang comes into that neighborhood and paints graffiti on a newly built wall. One neighborhood at a time, the money we currently spend to SUPPORT gang activity in inner cities could be used to utterly destroy gangs. 

&gt; We must increase our educational standards. 

I agree, again. But competition will only remove opportunities for poor parents/children. Other 1st world nations simply raise the damn standards. It's been working just fine in Europe for quite a while. We need to follow their models. Quit insisting that every kid has to have read Shakespeare to graduate HS. Start testing for proficiency early, and begin guided schooling early. If that 13 year old has a future laying bricks, start teaching him. If he's got a future as a chef, make that shit happen for him. 18 year olds with no direction, and no real specialized education are just being asked to fail. Unfortunately, this plan will require a cultural shift. It's not the kind of thing that will happen with one stroke of a pen. We will have to let go of some of our illusions of greatness first. 

&gt; We need to stop our sphere of influence around the globe. 

Yes. Yes. A thousand times, YES. Our military budget is at this point comedy... at best. We are taxing ourselves and borrowing ourselves into oblivion, and it's ALL OF IT CORPORATE WELFARE. EVERY LAST FUCKING DIME. We send some billions of aid to Israel every year, by way of example. And 90-odd percent of it is earmarked for weapons purchases from American companies! In short... we're borrowing money so that another nation can use it to buy our own manufactured hardware! This is a bad, sad joke, in the best of worlds. And I haven't even touched our own military budget with that example. Too many people are employed by the military, either directly or indirectly. Too much of our economy is tied up in this business. It needs to stop. Or else it WILL stop when our economy utterly collapses. 

And I'll leave the rest alone. We're challenging each other. It's ok. It's important to remember two things: One: The fight's not over unless we give up. And two:  we can't give up.

And who got arrested by other Muslims and will be tried in a court of justice by other Muslims and likely thrown in jail for the rest of his life. Funny you make no mention of that. 

&gt;Just once, instead of a moslim defending the inhumane actions that occur within his religion, i would love for you to own it.

At no point was I ever defending this action. I was merely putting it in context. All communities have violent fanatics and lunatics. In fact Muslims are generally *much more* peaceful compared to Westerners who have a horrific record of violent mass-murder, exploitation and imperialism throughout modern times. And why should Muslims have to ""own"" the acts of some extremist lunatic? Do all Westerners have to take responsibility of all criminals and crackpots in their midst? That's just ridiculous

&gt;If I was a bolshevik, I would own and be outraged at what my people had done. This isn't so in Islam, and that's why it is frustrating.

Muslims *are* outraged but they understandably get pissed off when ignorant Western chauvinists like you try paint them all of them with the same brush. You wouldn't like it if a Muslim claimed that the KKK is representative of all Americans or that the Nazis are representative of all Europeans. So why are you characterizing all Muslims and Islam according to the acts of a violent criminal fringe?

&gt;Yes, I would rather be governed by laws that are not archaic, that do not ""suggest"" women cover from head to toe, etc. So I do believe secularism &gt; islamic law. Now be rational and agree, because that's the only logical course of action for you.

There is nothing ""logical"" or rational about preferring secularism over Islamic law. Its an entirely subjective preference. And in any case Bangladesh is pretty much a secular country.

The European Central Bank appears to share this view, although it has warned that the recovery is likely to remain uneven, and has kept short-term rates at very low levels. The bond markets have therefore continued to receive considerable support from the economic background and the actions of the central bank.

Fisher Capital Management Seoul, South Korea: However, these factors have been much less important than the fears about the debt problems in Greece and in other weaker members of the euro-zone. After considerable prevarication, due primarily to strong German opposition to a bail-out; an agreement has been reached amongst the member countries that, in conjunction with the IMF, they will provide support for Greece if this becomes necessary to prevent a defaulton its sovereign debts.

But the details of the agreement are very vague, and there is certainly no guarantee that the country can carry out its promises to introduce significant reductions in spending levels to reduce the size of its debts. The agreement has helped the country to issue a further 5 billion bond; but it was forced to offer an interest rate of 5.9% on a seven-year bond, 325 basis points above the equivalent German bund, and that issue has subsequently moved to a substantial discount. Conditions have also been made worse by the downgrade in Portugals credit rating, and so the pressures on the bond markets are continuing.

Fisher Capital Management Seoul, South Korea: The gilt edged market has coped fairly well so far with the latest weakness in the bond market, an inadequate response in the latest Budget to the debt problems in the UK, and a warning from the Fitch rating agency that the governments timetable for reducing the fiscal deficit was frankly too slow, and that the countrys credit rating was at risk. The economic recovery remains very slow, and the Bank of England is holding short-term interest rates close to zero, so the market is receiving some support; but in all the circumstances it is perhaps surprising that it has managed to perform so well.

Fisher Capital Management Seoul, South Korea: The economic background in the UK remains depressed, but is slowly improving. Retail sales bounced back strongly; the public sector continued its recruitment programmed; and there has been a pickup in activity in both the manufacturing and service sectors of the economy.

It was not surprising therefore that the Bank of England kept short-term interest rates unchanged at the latest meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee and even suggested that it would be prepared to reactivate its quantitative easing programmed if this proved to be necessary. But this may not be enough to sustain gilt edged prices at current levels.

Fisher Capital Management Seoul, South Korea: The latest Budget statement is forecasting a slightly lower fiscal deficit of 167 billion in the 2009/10 fiscal year, and a halving of the deficit by 2013/14; but there is considerable skepticism in the markets about the growth assumptions underlying the figures, and about the willingness of the politicians to address the real problems
involved in reducing the deficit. If there is no credible plan to achieve this reduction, the country may well lose its AAA credit rating. Prospects have therefore become even more uncertain, and a move to higher yield levels seems unavoidable.

Fisher Capital Management Seoul, South Korea: The Japanese bond market is slightly weaker over the past month. It is likely that this year, for the first time, bond issuance may provide greater support for the fiscal deficit than tax revenues. This has already led to a downgrade on Japanese public debt by Standard and Poors, and with new bond issuance this year estimated to reach 44,300 billion, and to reach 55,300 billion by 2013, further downgrades seem likely. Japanese institutional investors are used to financing massive deficits, but it seems unlikely that deficits of this size can be adequately financed at present yield levels.

actually, neal stephenson has a really interesting article regarding rocketry that pertains here:

http://www.slate.com/id/2283469/pagenum/2

point 6 is what i would point out as a reason why government &gt; free markets.  for all of its ills, it still trumps markets because it CAN say (quite unreasonably) ""costs be damned"".  and SOME PROBLEMS do in fact require that attitude - whether it is mutually assured nuclear annihilation or the health care of everyone of your citizens who will ineluctably get sick and die.  some things simply CAN'T BE ADDRESSED **AT ALL** with an eye locked on ""efficiency"" or even **""making money""**!

&gt;So all of those options suck.
I'm not saying I know how these things should be done, I'm saying I know -- as a professional economist at a major think-tank -- that nobody does.
Does this mean we should do nothing about the failures of markets? It doesn't.

haha!  that's a truly interesting set of statements taken together.

ultimately, what you're saying there is that ""we have to do something but hell if i know...""  

i would put it even more simply.  fuck the things we don't have control over.  we're not omnipotent or omniscient.  fine.

what's left?

we have to do SOMETHING.

pretty easy when put that way dontcha think?

----------------------------------------------------

for example, a friend of mine who always argues the devil's advocate position says that it's impossible to remove money from politics... that money ""always finds a way"".

but again, that's a defeatist right wing appeal to ""imperfection"" and entropy as a reason not to engage.

it won't be perfect.  but we TRY.  and we AMMEND AS WE GO.

we could simply be defeatist about money when it comes to the organ transplant situation and say ""money always finds a way""... so fuck it - let's sell organs to the highest bidder.  but we don't do that!  we fight it.  uphill and unsuccessfully at times (COUGHstevejobsCOUGH) but we fight it.

--------------------------------------------

and i don't agree that it is so debilitatingly unknowable.  history and the current history of other nations serve as fine examples.

from history:

- child labor laws  - great!
- humane working conditions - fantastic!
- safe food, drink and drugs - love it!
- anti-monopoly laws HELPING free markets by keeping things competitive - huzzah!

from other nations, we have the example of successful first world nations countries in western europe and asia that have a lot of socialized programs that end up serving their constituents better than we do.

you point out the soviet union as an example to avoid.  definitely.  let's not do that.

but it doesn't mean that everything prefixed with ""public"" in america is pinko commie evil... 

- public roads
- public schools
- public library
- public fire department
- public police

---------------------------------------------------------------

&gt;The left doesn't have a real case, and nor does the right.

i disagree.  you're trying to be magnanimous by throwing the right in there too but this simply does not reflect reality.

i testify for the case of the left which is simply this:

** government has a valid role (right and responsibility) to play in regulating free markets.  the free market is an institution of man (not of God Almighty as some seem to think [lazy fucking minds running the syllogism COMMIES = EVIL ""therefore"" CAPITALISM = JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!] and as are all of his endeavors is fallible, corruptible and imperfect.  and just as the institution of government itself needs checks and balances, so does the institution of capitalism (and no goddammit, ""self regulation"" is not an option)**

i dunno... it would seem that any reasonable person would have difficulty disagreeing with that ""case"".  hahahaha... but they do.

if we can start there as a foundation, matters of ""how much"" or ""how little"" can certainly be addressed with whiteboard meetings.

but you will notice, there is a strong contingent of batshit insane teabaggers that 1. don't know what the goddamn fuck they're talking about when it comes to the constitution and 2. don't know what the goddamn fuck they're talking about when it comes to economics.  

and passion+ignorance is evidently the american way now... : ) ... fuck...

before we can get to the whiteboard, we have to agree to throw out the trash and the rabble.  to acknowledge that the ignorant and stupid have NOTHING to contribute and to silence them from the discourse.

and as surveys attest, you guys have more of the uneducated middle of america to go yell STFU to.

TLDR - the disconnect between left and right is this: RIGHT is based on FAITH in the system of capitalism.  LEFT is NOT based on FAITH in the govt but skepticism of EVERYTHING INCLUDING free markets.

When a band signs to a record label they sometimes (often?) assign the rights only for a particular territory, which is why you see some bands on one label in Europe and another in North America.

They can not distribute music to Europe if they have only purchased the rights to sell it in North America. 

In this instance Amazon is the distributor with whom the record label has an agreement. Since the record label does not have the legal right to collect money for music purchased outside of it's territory, the digital music distribution channels must have a way to restrict the sale to territories for which distribution rights are granted.

This is all a hold over from a time when a record label was actually in the business of producing a physical product, and music distributors where responsible for getting that physical product into stores.

No wars.

Notice when the Real is worth less, in the first 6 months of 2010, the GDP is higher. Then, the currency becomes worth more, and the GDP falls.

&gt;By your logic, such increases should have stymied their growth.

Hmmm....

I'm not saying that its possible to devalue yourself to prosperity. Germany benefits from the Euro taking a hit only in the short term. I am saying that to say that there are no benefits in the short term is short sighted. 

Yes, a weaker currency does lead to weaker imports. But thats obvious. And in Germany's case, not such a big deal. Because they export so much, and most of their imports come from other European Countries: 

http://www.economywatch.com/world_economy/germany/export-import.html 

In fact, Germany has a trade surplus, so increasing exports to provide jobs during Global recession in exchange for fewer imports isn't that bad of a trade. 

&gt;The German citizen must export more German goods in order to buy that quantity of american tobacco which he received before the devaluation for a smaller quantity of exported German goods.

This is true. But there are substitutes that would suffice for the moment. For example, Turkish tobacco. The German citizen will be exporting more goods naturally, and instead of converting the regular amount of US dollars that they are getting into American Tobacco, they can turn it into more Euros than they are used to getting, and buy cheaper Turkish Cigarettes. For those people that have to have their American Tobacco, then yes, the German buying that Tobacco has to do more to get the same amount, increasing demand for the same supply, thereby also increasing the price of said good. But then the good can be considered a luxury, and the German can charge extra per pack to make up for it. Which would be a normal price fluctuation. And since more Germans are working because of all the factory orders, then many still might be able to afford the price increase. Those who can't, buy the cheaper Turkish imports. 

I'm not suggesting that all the countries of Southeast Asia and Africa are the envy of the First World. But you do realize that you can sustainably live like a King in those parts of the World for pennies on the Dollar? You're right, poor countries with weak currencies get rocked by imports... but so do rich counties. The US has a very large trade deficit. Electronics are way out of reach in countries with weak currencies.... I don't know about that one: http://www.mikekujawski.ca/2009/03/16/latest-mobile-phone-statistics-from-africa-and-what-this-means/

&gt;The so-called improved competitiveness on account of currency depreciation means that the citizens of a country are now getting less real imports for a given amount of real exports. In other words, while the country is getting rich in terms of foreign currency, it is getting poor in terms of real wealth, i.e., in terms of the goods and services required for maintaining peoples' life and well-beings. Poorer in terms of buying commodities, poorer in terms of imports.

This I disagree with. German companies should be getting generally the same amount of US Dollars as usual, so they should be maintaining a wealth of Foreign Currency. But in the example that I gave, where the Euro fell thereby increasing German real exports for soft, Dollar, imports, German became wealthier in terms of Domestic Currency, which, because of the increasing productivity of the nation from increasing exports, went back into the Economy, fueling the goods and services required for maintaining peoples' well-being.

The use of the term to describe the whole country only occurred post-colonially and it is now commonly used in New Zealand English.[10] Abel Tasman sighted the islands in 1642 and named them Staten Landt, assuming they were connected to land off the southern tip of South America.[11] In 1645 Dutch cartographers renamed the islands Nova Zeelandia after the Dutch province of Zeeland.[12][13] British explorer James Cook subsequently anglicised the name to New Zealand.[n 8]

The aids epidemic, though i get the impression is being tackled quite well, must also be taken into account. This doesn't mean to say that people aren't happy, but if a  quarter of people are unemployed then that's clearly not an egalitarian society.

Botswana is doing pretty well for itself, its a functioning democracy and has a pretty high growth rate (though whether growth rates are an acceptable measure of happiness, fairness and an egalitarian society is questionable).

You judge me for wanting the government down as if I'm a PSD fan (and a thief, corrupt and briber, which shows your view on PSD and your bright PDL colors) and treat me like I don't think for myself and eat up everything Realitatea and Antena 3 feed me. And yet your *only sources* that you devour and swallow whole come from a guy whose true colors are so obvious they hurt my eyes. If you'd have given me international sources aka neutral sources, I would've bowed my head to you.

Like [this](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12055299): 
&gt; The French and German interior ministers said it was *""premature""* to let them join Schengen in March 2011. **They said Bulgaria and Romania needed to make ""irreversible progress"" in the fight against corruption and organised crime.**

Gee, I wonder why they started putting them in prison now. How about you stop letting Vlaston regurgitate information for you and think about this: investigations are started for a lot of things, they have to, but ""some people"" with influence can hinder investigations, can threaten or can bribe so that arrests don't take place. You know, corruption that we're so full of. Right now, the ""uppers"" desperately needed to make some arrest so they let some things go. Also, I wonder who and why decided for Constantin Nicolescu to be arrested now and not many years ago when he actually did shady things. Maaaaybe, just maybe, PDL had something to say about it, considering Nicolescu is from PSD. And why the heck don't I see PDL people arrested much, do you really mean to tell me they're clean and shiny? Ugh. 

Anyway, if these arrests continue, I hope they fucking throw those guys in prison too and keep them there, because simply arresting them doesn't prove much unless they show the justice system is really just and we'll see them behind bars for as long as they deserve. I also wanna see PDL officials arrested as well to believe the change or I'll think they're being protected. I highly doubt these arrests are a coincidence to have happened now of all times, when we most need it.

And finally, if this continues as a trend and they get convicted and changes will really take place, KUDOS, HURRAY FOR ROMANIA! But I won't attribute this to PDL and Basescu because their involvement here is minimal, while their involvement in decisions like raising taxes and cutting salaries was huge. If they fix the fucking economy that they mostly screwed by themselves and keep at getting deserving guys in jail, then I'll really believe things are going in the right direction. So far, I only see things done to their own interests.

Next time you reply, don't show me how you swallow whole the regurgitated information a PDL-coloured guy wrote. Either you're really really gullible, or a PDL fan. ",1426741305,,c1fgl78,1,fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,0,pidge_,False,t3_feepp,

* The Tossers

* Greenland Whalefishers (they're from Norway, but they're awesome)

* Blood or Whiskey (they turned sort of ska a while back, but they still have an Irish feel)

* Blaggards

* Siobhan (sadly not around anymore, but their lead singer currently sings for the Dreadnoughts)

* The Mahones

* Meisce

* Mr. Irish Bastard (German, but sound pretty damn Irish)

* The Porters (Also German)

* Neck (One of the best new bands to come out in a while)

* Pipes and Pints (I believe they're Czech, but they have a very similar sound to DKM)

* Pubcrawlers

* Irish Stew of Sindidun (This is an interesting one: They're Serbian. Turns out that Irish punk made it big over in Eastern Europe during the 90s. I wouldn't say that they're exactly one of the best, I just think it's kind of interesting to hear someone with a thick Serbian accent sing ""Come Out Ye Black and Tans"")

Now, if you're interested in other folk punk that sounds sort of Celtic-y, might I also suggest:

* Mutiny (Aussie folk punk, one of my favorite bands)

* Catgut Mary (Aussie folk again, but with a harder-edged sound)

* The Dreadnoughts (more sea-shanty than strictly Celtic, lead singer was in Siobhan, another one of my all-time favorites)

The British colonies in the Americas started in the early 1600s. At that point, ""English"" was a hodgepodge of regional dialects. Sure, the nobles at court would have insisted they were speaking ""proper"" English, but they were a tiny minority. At that point, Englishmen from Yorkshire had a hard time understanding Englishmen from Cornwall.

The spoken language in each colony developed as mix of whatever dialects the original settlers spoke. The dialect in some colonies turned into a creole-- New York had a lot of Dutch words in the mix, Philadelphia had a lot of German. Generally, we can say that speech patterns evolved faster in the colonies than in England because of the different backgrounds of early settlers and because the literacy rates in the colonies were lower than those in England.

If you want formal dates, [Johnson's dictionary of (British) English was published in 1755](http://en.wikipedia.or/wiki/A_Dictionary_of_the_English_Language) and [Noah Webster published the first dictionary of American English in 1828](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Webster). It's hard to make the case that there was a standard ""British English"" and ""American English"" before those dictionaries existed.

So it's safe to say that American and British English had diverged by 1828.

Similar case with shellfish, when not cooked or stored in the means that were unavailable at the time, they too were known to cause illness. 

It was for these reasons, that they made their way into religious texts, simply as a way to let it be known to the populous that eating pigs was bad for you.  

This general rule continued on into islam, as even hundereds of years later, pigs still spread disease in middle eastern countries.

Christianity on the other hand started in Rome, and in Europe, eating pig is pretty damn popular. As there isn't the same climate as the middle east, eating pork has always been safe, so there was no justification for implementing that dietary change so strictly.

That is surely irrelevant to the extent that it is even true.  The World Wars, especially World War II, are what *made* America a global superpower; so pointing to our first great incident of foreign intervention and saying ""before that, we *hated* foreign intervention"" in fact says very little.  The fact is that World War II almost single-handedly inaugurated a potent myth of American moral/military primacy that was firmly entrenched by the zeitgeist of the Cold War.  That we generally followed an isolationist policy *before* the second World War is certainly true; it is equally true that images of Americans saving Europe from Nazis have become every bit as iconic as, and unarguably better-represented in film and television than, images of the American Revolution.

&gt; We are traditionally a nation of xenophobes, and if not for our government, we would not be involved with anyone.  Look at the extent that your average citizen wants to deal with the middle east: ""Just nuke the whole lot of em.""

First of all, this is not making us look like the humble proponents of peaceful international relations your initial post would make us out to be.  If (as I quite agree) the ""average citizen"" considers nuclear annihilation the proper reward for irritating the US and generally being a troublesome region, it's not hard to see why no one's happy we have a ton of nukes.

Second of all, you keep proposing a dichotomy that is simply illogical - the dichotomy between America and its government.  This is a distinction that people are allowed to draw when they live under dictatorships, but life in a democracy vitiates it.  When our government wanted us to be isolationist, we were, and when it did not, we were not.  It might be that the electorate began to favor interventionist politicians on its own, and it might be that interventionist politicians convinced the electorate their policy made the most sense.  Either way, though, there is the same bottom line: **They said they were going to intervene and we voted for them.**

While I do not doubt for a second that the track record of invested states (primarely US but EU nations as well) indicates a preoccupation with Israel when there are other issues to discuss.  
But the article loses coherency when national policy failures become sysnomyn with anyone handing critique to Israel regarding Palestine.

We were fortunate enough to have an Italian trained cook so meals were excellent but were mainly local food and Italian or European based dishes. Meat (beef mainly) was harder to get so goat or local wildlife were the meat of choice and we had plenty of fish in the dams. Most meals because of that were fish and vegetables and simple in nature. If we did have red meat, we BBQ'd it (they call it [Nyama Choma](http://www.congocookbook.com/meat_recipes/nyama_choma.html)). Even for me coming from Canada, I missed some North American based meals. But then the cook would whip up a tasty meal; all was forgotten. 

Obesity it is everywhere, getting worse in most places and no country is really immune. I guess it just stood out more prominently while I was there. Even here in Canada, I am seeing it more frequently now and sadly at younger ages.

It's surprising that you don't appear to be aware of the statistics! You will need at least 5 years postdoctoral experience (preferably through securing very competitive independent research fellowships). Newly appointed lecturers are generally between 30 - 40. Figures from my institution (one of the best in the UK) show that approximately 1 in 20 PhD students go on to become university lecturers; many of these are foreign students who go back to lecture in their home countries. The figure will almost certainly be worse at other institutions with a lower reputation and less ability to attract talented research students. I would strongly suggest making a backup plan given that you don't appear to be at Oxbridge (pretty much the new lecturer factory of the UK) and are likely to be in the other 95% in any case.

I don't see any honest attempt to dispute any statement i made. For instance, you made a quite remarkable claim about US interests in africa. When i point out the real geopolitical reason, ie lack of widespread oil reserves, which is quite different from your assertion, you merely claim that i repeat it. 

5) You tried to spin US non-involvement in africa as being the product of Africa having it's own checks and balances with a few occasional petrol boats or bombing raids from the US without addressing the hypocritical US stand of spreading democracy and fighting dictators. Why do you think the US currently is in war in two countries directly and a third indirectly in the middle-east and has no military presence in any african country? Do you think it's because the US really cares about preventing genocides? If that were truly the case, the US would not be in bed with so many totalitarian regimes and so many military dictators.

ps. Since i had already mentioned that the Soviet Union had attacked afghanistan, who is repeating information? ( Also note that Russia is quite a different beast from the Soviet Union, though formed from it )

6) If you take your history lessons from magazines, i guess one cant expect too much, suffice it to say that Afghanistan never really had a 
stable democratic setup, let alone a western-style democratic setup.

Here's a link for you to explore in case you are interested in a short timeline of Afghani political history in the 20th century. http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/1162108.stm. Note the total lack of democratic governments.

7) You miss the whole point when you dismiss a whole continent which is struggling with democracy. Africa got it's independence from colonial powers only in the last century. These countries have been freed from outside influence only for the last 60+ years. Look at how long it took europe to become half-way civilized. They had a few centuries of being relatively independent, and yet wasted so much time fighting with each other. Even WW1 and WW2 is basically a bunch of local european countries fighting with each other and the US managed to get involved in thanks to Japan getting into a pissing match.

If pro war thugs take control of Egypt, they will destabilize the middle east.  If that happens, there are very serious global consequences.  I'm not talking some sissy shit like our fair weather global recession, I'm talking a complete economic collapse of the world.  Global debt is already flirting with disaster as we've seen several times in the last couple years.  Truth be told, many countries are merely 1 big oil scare away from disaster whether or not there are any real shortages.  Once the first big nation's economy hits the skids, it'll domino effect around all the top countries.

If this happens there will be consequences that are different on a regional level.  Since most of you are posting from the USA, Canada and Europe, I'll focus on those.

If you live in the USA: you will have crippling gas prices followed by shortages.  On the bright side, you get to keep eating.  As a food producing nation that can fall back on coal to transport goods, heat your homes and provide electricity, you get the luxury life of the collapse.  Good for you.

If you live in Canada:  Not much different than the USA, maybe a bit more expensive.  Our two nations like to poke fun at each other but if shit hit the fan, our relations are too good to abandon each other.

If you live in Europe:  I'd get a gun and organize at the local level to protect each other.  I don't know as much about your food/fuel situation but I do know that the middle east wouldn't take long to come knocking at your doors.  War mongering players will rise to power out of the instability in the middle east and they view you as the gateway to the west.  Good luck to you.

Feel free to correct me where I'm obviously wrong, this is merely one man's perception on the global scene.

ETA:  If you don't live in a food producing nation, I would stockpile food and start as soon as you can.  Make no mistake, if a real global economic crisis occurs, you will have a food shortage.

The reason why Muslim thinkers often complain about secularism is that when the West holds up this notion of ""secularism"", which is a unique invention of the West due to its own political and religious history (eg in a country like China, it makes almost no sense to talk about secularism since there is no historical social context to base it on),  it seems that what ""secularism"" means is an ideology inherently intolerant of Islam and unable to grant Muslims freedom of religion.  For example, so-called ""secular"" government in Europe are fond of using their legal system to target Muslims for discrimination.

The point of discouraging secularism is the desire for Muslim people to have a place for Islam in their society, so they aren't forced to live in a government that won't provide for their needs as a people.  Western influence in the Middle East, historically, has been almost entirely devoted toward curbing or eliminating Islam, so when a Muslim country is made ""democratic"" and ""secular"" by the hands of Western powers and their collaborators, undesirable changes take place in society, such as the legalization and public promotion of alcohol, adultery, revelry, homosexuality, and other things which degrade and destroy human life.

You're simply been trying to avoid seeing the argument in those terms. See:

&gt; You are the one who has dismissed 100 deaths (Grenada) as less significant than 4,000,000 (Holocaust).

No, you're the one who wants to compare the two. Because you said Reagan was a ""nutter"" for invading Granada, and Hitler was a ""nutter"" for conquering Europe and causing many millions of deaths. You are the one trying to draw an equivalence between the two. I've been trying to get you to understand the concept of a moral equivalence. Let me put it this way. You stand accused of jaywalking. Jaywalking is proscribed by law. So is murder. Is your jaywalking as bad as murder? Both are illegal. So when I talk about a moral equivalence, I'm trying to get you to understand the difference. There were good reasons for liberating Granada. Despite what you might have heard, the government we deposed was not legitimate, and was cooperating with Cuba to the detriment of our national security, and was threatening the lives and safety of American civilians. We invaded. Some deaths resulted. This was sad, but did not outweigh the *moral* necessity for our actions. Contrast this with Hitler conquering Europe.

The idea that both Hitler's actions and Reagan's actions are mere ""political actions"" is ridiculous. To circle back around, it's the same as saying that your jaywalking is the equivalent of murder. After all, both are illegal. Both are detrimental to society. Should the law treat them equally?

It's competition that gives businesses the incentive to provide the best product/service at the lowest price.

Also, like I said before, there's the problem of the deficit.

If the government is paying $3 of that $5, so it only costs $2 for Americans to produce the same pound of corn using the SAME METHODS - and they DO use the same methods - then the Americans can sell the corn for far lower.

Then how come we are not out competing European, or Chinese, or Australian or Japanese or Russian farmers? 

The reason is because they have the same ability to produce corn cheaply or simply import it if the climatically cannot match our volume. 

Those who cannot match the industrialization are at risk. That is why we need to educate foreign farmers in modern sustainable technique. 

&gt;It would be cheaper. That's how economics works.

So massively reducing the supply = cheaper? What kind of crazy economics have you been reading?

&gt;More supply of grass fed beef, lower prices for grass fed beef.

Grass fed beef is 8/lb *because* corn fed beef is 3/lb. The corn fed beef bears the brunt of the demand and the grass fed beef supplies only the premium market. 

&gt;It's not the same, other crops are naturally occurring and fully digestible by the human body (and far better suited for human consumption).

Wow, just... wow. From this statement alone it is abundantly clear that you have absolutely not idea what you are talking about.

First of all, corn is full digestible by the human body besides the hull because it is made of cellulose. All that is in corn is the starchy endosperm. 

Domestication is not limited corn. The wild version of corn is teosinte, the wild version of wheat is brachypodium, the wild version of rice is rufipogon, tomato's and potato's are just domesticated nightshades, I could go on and on.

This is absolutely false. First of all, children become ""fluent"" (or at least master the vast majority of their native language's grammar) at age *5*. Now mind you I don't mean just English or Polish speakers here, I mean every (normally developing) speaker of any language, anywhere, ever. This is a fact. If what you said were true, there would arguably be no native speakers of Polish, because by adolescence most people's ability to learn another language is severely degraded. No language, no matter how ""complicated"" it seems, takes any longer to learn than any other when you're a child.

As for the claim that Polish is the most complex language in the world, that's more stuff and nonsense. As has already been mentioned, Finnish is a language that is morphologically more complicated (it has 15 semantic cases, and geminate consonants and vowels), to say nothing of the many, many [polysynthetic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysynthetic) indigenous North American languages, or languages such as those in the [Bantu family](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantu_languages#Language_structure) in Africa (which can have 20+ noun classes, otherwise known as grammatical gender in Indo-European languages).

The real problem with debating linguistic complexity is that complexity turns out to be a difficult thing to measure without a frame of reference. What most people (seemingly you included) mean by ""complexity"" is *morphological* complexity. Nouns can be marked for case, noun class, and number, verbs can be marked for person, number, gender, mood, tense, aspect, etc, etc, etc. That's all well and good, but that's only a fraction of the complexity seen in human language. Polish morphology is, in comparison with English, certainly more ""complex"". The thing is, languages that are ""simple"" in one respect are often more complex in others. Think of it like one of those puzzles where the pieces are tiles on a board. You can push them to one side or the other, or distribute them equally across the board, but they've got to go somewhere. Let's take English, for example, since that seems to be the frame of reference here. English has an unusual system for forming questions. It turns out that this is something that often trips up speakers of Slavic languages when they learn English, because they first have to learn that you change the word order of an interrogative sentence by (usually) fronting the word in question. Once they learn that, they often come to the annoying revelation that those rules only hold for main clauses. In embedded clauses those question words stay put (compare *what are you doing?* with *I don't know what you are doing*). Now here's another example: determiners (e.g. *the, a, this*, etc). Polish and other Slavic languages have no overt determiners, so for speakers of these and many other languages, learning the intricacies of English determiner use is often difficult (consider for a second when you use the word *the* and when you don't, for a brief example). Now by no means do we have to keep using English as an example here. How about Chinese, which you also mentioned. You are correct that Mandarin is morphologically less complex than Polish, but the problem that foreign learners of Mandarin have with it is just not just with the writing system, it's more often the tone system that people complain about. Every language has tone, but languages like English and Polish use intonation at the level of discourse to signal information about the type of sentence (interrogative, declarative, etc) or in order to stress a word, etc. In Mandarin and loads of other languages (e.g. other Asian languages, many African languages, etc), tone is lexical rather than discoursal. This means that every single word has its own tone specification. Mandarin has four tones, meaning every word will have one of four possible tones (Cantonese has even more). This tends to be very difficult thing for foreign learners of the language that don't already speak a language with lexical tone.

So here's the deal: linguistic complexity is relative. It depends entirely on what linguistic structures you're comparing, and what languages you're comparing. Learning Norwegian might be easy for a native speaker of Swedish, but it's not usually simple for a native speaker of Japanese. Objectively, there is no such thing has an inherently simple language, or an inherently complex language. ",1426743348,,c1fkxbq,0,technology,0,PumpkinCrook,False,t3_ffe3c,
