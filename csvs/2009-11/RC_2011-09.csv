1) The article posted by abuali7866 completely ignores the fundamental ties between antisemitism and anti-Israelism and the reality that many veil their antisemitism by criticizing ""Israelis"" or ""Zionists"". This is a common thing for bigots to do lately - use carefully selective language to deflect such accusations. This does not mean that there is not legitimate criticism of Israel, but a lot of it - especially on the internet, where people don't have to publicly out themselves as bigots - is antisemitic, and places an unfair double standard on Israel, while ignoring far greater civil rights offenders around the world. This criticism also usually ignores the civil rights advantages that Israel has over every other nation in the middle east.

2) Sailer says ""I would take exception to one thing the author claimed, i.e., the ""near annihilation"" of European Jewry.""

t1_c2gluzk,0,c2gndoc,"&gt;how markets will self regulate

You know all of those big banks that reddit is always bitching about? BofA, JP Morgan, and the others. From a couple of decades these banks were all participating in completely idiotic and unstable get rich quick schemes. You know what happened to these banks? They all failed. Every one of them would have gone out of business and the smaller, more stable, less greedy, and less idiotic banks would have stepped in to take their places, as they would inevitably collect the remnants of the bigger banks. Things like the derivatives market, which reddit loves to bitch about, would have a stigma associated with them about how everyone who got involved lost a ton of money, so people would be afraid to invest in unstable markets like these. Instead, we bailed these fuckers out, they're participating in the same unstable markets, Bank of America is looking like it's about to fail again, and it's getting obvious that the EU and US financial systems are dangerously close to self destructing again. 

Keynseyan economists tend to use the analogy that the economy is like a car, and sometimes all it needs is a little extra fuel. Personally I see that world view as a sort of creationism, and it almost mirrors the [Watchmaker analogy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmaker_analogy). It's a top down approach to something which clearly does not come about from the top down.

Austrian Economists (the free market proponents) on the other hand, see the economy as more of an ecosystem, built from the ground up, where members must and will adapt to their environment, and naturally goes through ups and downs, but will recover if given enough time. Using the ecosystem approach, imagine that you wouldn't to stimulate growth in an ecosystem, so you decided to buy a ton of nutrients and fertilizers, and dump them in. Sure, there would be population booms *at first*, but the growth would inevitably become unstable and unsustainable, which would inevitably lead to massive suffering and die-off. 

There is an intellectual debate being revived between Austrians and Keynesians, with Austrians saying that the era of Keynseyanism is coming to a close. The Keynseyans would say that more stimulus is the key to more growth. The Austrians would say that the Keynseyan model relies on a top down approach, which is their [Fatal Conceit.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fatal_Conceit)

If you're new to econ, or in general want to learn more about the debate beyween the Keynseyans and the Austrians, [this rap battle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTQnarzmTOc) is actually both a really good and really fun way of learning the basics of both schools.

Wean yourself off of your dependence of money and industrial society. Here are some things you think you need, which you don't need: Air conditioning, heating, television, internet, your car, gasoline.

When the crash comes, there will be no grocery store food, as that requires gas and money for distribution. Do not be dependent on supermarket food or factory food. Vegetables are healthier anyway.

Look into [ecovillages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecovillages). They are self-sustaining communities which, as a goal, grow enough food to feed themselves. Here is an incomplete [directory](http://directory.ic.org/maps/) of them.

While money is still considered valuable, invest in a bicycle, and a tire pump for it, prefrably with a gauge. A good quality bike will run you about $500 and last you forever if it doesn't get stolen. (Invest in a lock for it.) The tire pump will be, at most, $50, and the lock should be about $30. You should also get front and back lights for it, which are usually $12 each, or $24. So the total will be about $602. It may seem expensive, but if you compare it to a car:

* $0 spent on gas ever, vs. $400 per month
* $0 spent on oil changes, transmission, brake fluid, and all the other random crap that will go wrong with your car, vs. hundreds of dollars
* $0 spent on parking ever, vs. (if you live in a city) hundreds of dollars
* Environmental benefits
* Exercise benefits

The bicycle is the pinnacle of human technological acheivement, and you should have one.

Learn as many skills as possible. The following is an incomplete list of skills you should learn. Many of them are skills you can get for free, and there is most likely a subreddit for all of them.

* How to start a fire
* How to hunt large animals such as deer and buffalo
* How to use the materials to make clothing, tents, food, and shelter
* Martial arts
* Cooking
* Woodworking
* Metallurgy
* People skills
* Beekeeping
* Botany, knowing which plants are useful, etc.
* Knitting, sewing, making your own clothing - it'll get cold
* Teaching
* Building boats
* Navigating

Sometimes it helps to have a variety of friends with different skills, but each of you should accumulate the most possible amount of skills. Teach each other. Have a good group.

Be prepared to travel a lot. Exercise now, while you still have time. Run a mile a day, or more. You will need to be in shape.

Get yourself a few books on Native American philosophy. I recommend [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Circle-Life-Traditional-Teachings-American/dp/1574160826/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1314838904&amp;sr=8-1). Any sentence that begins with ""The Native Americans..."" is a gross generalization, like ""The Europeans..."" However, the Native Americans had developed economic, political, agricultural, and social systems which worked well for at least 14,000 years before the Europeans reached this continent. (And the European system, measured in terms of poverty, enviornmental destruction, health, economics, and overall happiness, has failed miserably in the 500 years since it got here.)

Most Native American groups never would have had problems such as economic collapses or inflation. By making yourself familiar with their worldviews, you will understand how we should rebuild when the population peaks and we have the opportunity to start from scratch.

The Earth is your mother. Take care of her, and she will take care of you. Respect her, and she will respect you.

All the other humans, animals, plants, and insects - they are your brothers and your sisters. Respect them, and they will respect you.

Get off the grid now, before you're forced to. Do not depend on electricity, cell phones - even tap water may not be clean after the crash.

Being the highly destabilizing force they are, they either carve out an empire themselves--which is doomed due to resupply issues, or wage a shock-and-awe campaign designed to produce political capitulation and accommodation.  This is similar to what europeans did in central america with limited resupply capabilities.  I don't think there's any reason to believe a short campaign on Rome wouldn't be capable of doing this.  The Romans elite were highly politically sophisticated, and I doubt that they'd see a war of attrition as politically reasonable.  

The shock and awe is just qualitatively different than Hannibal's invasion.  That was dealing with a conventionally superior military force.  You can say all you want about the Romans being tactically intelligent--most of that tactical intelligence was concentrated at the top.

I don't own one of these, so I am not sure, but it could be possible that the product is made in one of their North American plants, which would easily show why the price varies so much.

Now for the tires, they may both be 15 inch wheels, but there is further math involved. yaris tire has a width of 185 mm, corolla 195mm. That means that the yaris tire has 60% of the width of the tire (111 mm/ 11.1 cm/ 4.4"") on each side of the 15"" rim, which makes for a grand total of 23.8 inches for the yaris wheel. The corolla wheel is 65% of 195 mm (126.75 mm/ 12.675 cm/ 5 inches) total of 25 inches. While you may not notice a difference while driving, the wheel with the smaller tire will always be spinning at a faster rate, causing more wear on the parts attached to it. It can be done, but I would recommend against it.

*EDIT : UNLESS the corolla is an older model, with the four bolt hub (2002 or older for North America, 2000 or older for Asia/Europe)(E110 series &amp; older) then you could probably use the wheel as well, but i would still say don't do it. * I had ignored the fact that there was no year mentionned for the corolla. my bad.

I never really wanted to do PD, the thought of having a catheter for a long period of time is really not my thing, I had one for access for around 8 months and I hated every minute of it, I felt free again when it got whipped out and I was able to make use of the fistula. As with yourself I've had some ups and downs, being on dialysis really gives you a different outlook on life, you don't take the little things for granted and when you have a chance to do something you get up and do it because the next day you might not be feeling up to it because of the dialysis. 
Had some bad experiences too, my fistula took 3 attempts to get right leaving me with 3 bad scars on my left arm and a dull pain pretty much 24/7 in my wrist(I'm going to see a physio about it soon) When I had the catheter I was in the hospital a few times with infection from it, had it replaced once which wasn't the most comfortable thing I've had done!

I've still managed to travel, I live in Scotland and I've dialysed in Portugal, London and soon to be Wales, If you can get things arranged in advance then there's no reason not to travel anywhere, especially in the EU where it's all paid for by the NHS.

The real deal is not that Americans can't afford college education, it's that our culture and society is much more diverse and distributed than most of Europe and/or Australia. If you really want to go to college in America it's not that difficult. High school is easy here, and if you are low income and a minority getting your college paid for entirely is certainly not an unachievable feat if you are even slightly ambitious. The big thing is, a lot of people in American don't *want* to go to college and that's perfectly fine. Some people are just raised wrong or have cultural issues that tell them the best way to get rich and have a successful life is to thug out and start rapping or get drunk and redneck the hell out of yourself and garbage like that.

After work one day, my dad and grandma went back to my grandma's apartment to do up the books for the day and usually after school I would walk to my grandma's and meet them there. My grandma lived in an apartment on the very top floor so there was nobody above but the rooftop.

My dad and grandma unlock the door and see it's chained shut, they assumed it was me and started calling my name to come unlock the door. They can see through the opening in to the living room and sure enough, they were being robbed by 2 guys! My grandma starts yelling at them through the door and the 2 guys bolt out on to the veranda and climb up on to the roof. My dad moves my grandma aside and kicks open the door!

My dad rushes in after them and my grandma goes to the kitchen and gets a huge butcher knife! My dad realizes they went up on to the roof and are heading for the stairs access so he moves to cut them off. By the time he reaches the stairs, they are already running down and lucky for them, my grandma didn't reach the stairs first! My dad chases these 2 guys out to the streets and is gaining on them when the guy in the lead runs across the street and gets smoked by a car. The second guy turns and pulls a knife on my dad at which point my dad stops and backs up giving him some space. My dad was empty handed and noticed the guys didn't have time to actually take anything so he figured it wasn't worth the risk.

t3_k0npm,0,c2gnumw,"I basically just did this (from Sept 2010 - March 2011).  I had just graduated college and thought this is the perfect time to do this, and I regretted never studying abroad.  I knew I was only going to go for 6 months, but I just packed up and left.  Australia is probably the easiest country for Americans to get work visas.  I applied online, it cost about $250, and had my visa in about 10 hours.  I would suggest you go to Melbourne first, it is the easiest city to find work in.  I moved into a hostel called ""Home Travellers"" in St.Kilda (a sort of suburb of Melbourne) and it was basically full of other backpackers working or trying to find work so they could just live in Melbourne.  You'll be amazed at how many people you meet who are trying to do the exact same thing you are.

I tried to find a job before I left, but that is pretty much impossible.  I would say that if you want a job, you'll find one.  you might not find a great one at first, but you just take what you can get and then keep looking.  I've played golf my entire life so I figured it would be pretty cool to work on a course there.  After being in Australia for a week, sending my CV to every course in the area, I had two job offers.  A week later I started working at Albert Park Golf Course.  I made $21/hour, no real responsibilities, and I got to work outside all day.

So I lived in this hostel for about four months, just working and trying to experience as much as I could.  I made so many friends from all over the world (I am planning a 6 month trip through Aisa and Europe to visit a lot of those friends now).  I saved up some money and then spent one month traveling around Australia, and one month traveling all over New Zealand.  The trip was amazing, and I just can't believe how we Americans miss out on this sort of traveling.  Backpacking to us is a month in Europe, when to the rest of the world it is probably a minimum of 6 months away.  

I was definitely scared to go by myself, but it turned out to be the best thing.  It forces you to initiate conversations, and I am now much more outgoing, confident person.  Pretty much every one of my friends is jealous of my trip.

Well, I would say definitely just do this.  Get your work visa, buy your plane ticket and just go.  You'll be nervous, and second guess yourself until you have a job, but just keep reminding yourself that so many other people do this exact thing (but Americans just don't hear about it).

&gt;I agree with Mises that fascism is the lesser evil than communism. But both are supremely evil. How am I ""suffering from cognitive dissonance"" if I AGREE with Mises?

Do you agree with Mises that fascism had the ""best intentions""?

&gt;That does not refute anything said prior such that you are justified in saying ""that's not what happened, THIS is what happened!"" What you just said here is separate and speaks of the US, not fascism in Europe, which was the original context.

No, I said that fascism in Europe got totally out of hand. This is because it did not have the ""best intentions"". It was a movement to enslave and exterminate people (hey, just like the southern racists!).

&gt;Are mathematicians ""fundamentalists"" as well?

The difference is that mathematics axioms aren't idiotic assumptions about complex human nature. They are simple axioms of set theory or category theory. And these axioms define simple symbolic operations and properties to do derivations. Praxeology has none of this (it pretends that it can capture the actions of the human brain in some sort of logic, while completely ignoring topics like neuroscience, psychology, and so on), yet it pretends to be as rigorous. Therefore, praxeology is just pseudo-mathematics.

&gt;Weird, since I find people who advocate for violence against innocent people to be the crazy types.

Weird, coming from a person that advocates everyone give up their voting rights and just pay mafias protection money.

&gt;I consider peace advocates like me to be the only sane people in the world.

This might be true, but humans are not naturally peaceful. Peace is an ideal that we can strive for, but it isn't going to magically happen. Sadly, the only way that the industrialized world stopped directly fighting each other is because of nuclear weapons. But war is basic human nature. We wouldn't be intelligent without the evolutionary selection that early tribal war created. And we wouldn't have our current technology without the wars that drove the agricultural and industrial revolutions. 

&gt;Not really. Just keeping things even, instead of one sided the way you want it.

Oh baw. You gave me a weak response when I asked you about intellectual progress.


&gt;which Austrians have shown to be utterly fallacious and riddled with contradictions and fallacies.

Austrians haven't shown anything except for how to be indignant.


&gt;No, Hobbes' doctrine has not proved workable. Hobbes' doctrine is an ex post justification for already existing states.

Right, because after Hobbes's work, nearly every major country in the world didn't adopt some form of explicit social contract. I guess when you only read history by people like Woods and Dilorenzo, you tend to miss certain little facts.

&gt;Anarcho-capitalism does not call for a bloody dictatorship

No, anarcho-capitalism basically just calls for a power vacuum that will lead to war. It will never work unless everyone with power agrees to make it work. Do you really think that private military companies aren't going to find it more profitable to simply raid the weak than to do business with them? In the end, there is really no difference between the private military companies and the states. They will form alliances and eventually one group will win out over the others until a state has formed. Your so-called anti-statism is simply denying the natural evolution of human societies. 

&gt;myth of the state.

The state is no myth. States exist. Anarcho-capitalism does not exist (unless you want to discuss international realism, then states *are* the insurance/private military companies, but then your ideology is basically meaningless).

&gt;We have every reason to accept that it will.

When? How? Please give a plausible scenario of how we get from point A to point B. I'd love to hear it.

&gt;It's like you're giving me a piss-filled kiddie pool, and asking me to do synchronized swimming in it.

And this is a fantastic counter-argument. The reason you can't see the argument is because you reject the entire concept of evidence. Your idiotic magic world doesn't exist. It is just another utopian view.

&gt;while the state confiscates and takes control of my property.

I'm going to say what I hope is the most insulting thing I can say to an Austrian: I hope you get evicted by eminent domain so a piece of public infrastructure (maybe a highway or a school) can be built on your former land. I just want to see your pathetic squirming reaction.

&gt;(compares paying taxes to rape)

I'll respond like you: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

&gt;I am forced, ultimately at gunpoint, to pay for roads that I may not even want or value, to pay the FDA that I didn't ask for, and to pay a current generation of politicians who had no hand in the basic crude packet switching technology which was discovered by a government contractor, and you are claiming that my mere usage of these things AFTER the fact, is what justifies the whole thing?

Good and yes.

&gt;You're insane.

And you're naive. Please move to a place that has no taxes and find out how wonderful these societies function.

&gt;Are you really so obtuse that you can't even see that when libertarian purists ""defend"" slavery, what they are really doing is defending an individual's right to determine their own lives, even if it is abhorrent in the eyes of others, even if the individual chooses to kill themselves, maim themselves, and yes, even enslave themselves? Who are you to dictate what other individuals can and can't do with their own bodies?

So, a person ""chooses"" to become a slave? What about when a person chooses to no longer be a slave anymore? This totally exposes you for the fraud you are.

Once again, you are a fucking idiot.

&gt;This is about the individual. 

And an individual can choose not to participate. I'd agree with you 100% about states enslaving people if you weren't allowed to expatriate. But unlike slavery, you are always given an opt out.

&gt;I am going to mandate that you pay me $500 a month in exchange for my lessons on economics.

Come and try to take it from me. If you do so, I will likely be able to defend myself because you are simply one idiot and I have plenty of weapons. And if you are successful, then I will send the power of the state after you to throw you in jail (where you can get some real lessons about what it is like to be oppressed).

Also, your ""lessons"" aren't economics. It is just childish drivel masquerading itself as something more.

&gt;False equivocation. That people defend themselves FROM violence, by using violence, does not justify initiations of violence.

How do you think the land was acquired in the first place. If you are in the US, your land was once held by Indian tribes and that was acquired using violence and then sold off to someone else, which continued down the line until you acquired it. And further, your land is violence through the police and military from those that would take it away from you with violence.

&gt;Then why do you call for the government to take ownership of my land by divine or magical right?

I never said it was magical. I said the government can do it in practice because the government has a monopoly on violence. Luckily, that monopoly on violence is controlled through a Republic rather than a more corrupt and immoral system. This is purely pragmatism. 

&gt;No, you own something because you legitimately acquired it. 

Your argument is an inductive one: person x+1 acquires land from person x, who acquired it from person x-1, and so on. However, what about person 0? What if they stole the land? Does that make each subsequent transactions legitimate? Do you think it is wrong to purchase goods you know were stolen and then claim property rights on them? Please, explain the base case of how you legitimately acquired it under your ideology. 

&gt;Anyone who tries to steal land from the legitimate owners are committing violence against innocent people. They have no right to do that.

Then we have a lot of work to do. We must go back to when humans first evolved and left Africa and figure out who originally homesteaded each piece of land.

&gt;You sound like an axe murderer.

No, I sound like someone that thinks that human morality is merely a construct we have that was evolutionarily advantageous and not absolute or objective in nature (note: just like how being good at war and violence were evolutionary advantageous).

&gt;HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

HAHAHA. This idiot thinks he is oppressed in a western country in the 21st century.

&gt;Is it a guarantee that we have no guarantees? BOOM goes the dynamite!

Once again, for someone that claims to have studied mathematics, you seem to not know how this was resolved.

&gt;I asked you for which ideas are crankish IN the Austrian worldview, NOT which ideas are held to be crankish BY Austrians.

Everything about you is crankish. I said you generally are generally free to do what you want and your response was to write over 1500 iterations of HA.

&gt;Same way I ""deal"" with nuclear proliferation among states. I am absolutely against the construction, distribution, sale, and deployment of ALL weapons of mass destruction. With no exceptions.

Okay. So you are against it. Then what about your suicidal jihadist or ideological Stalinist neighbor? As I said before, your ideology only works if everyone agrees to it. This is why it is not workable. The technology exists and you can't uninvent it. So you have to deal with it besides saying ""can't we all just play nice??!?""

You argue that gold has inherent value, like it's something in the molecules that gives it value. But the point about bushmen shows the truth of that argument: gold does not have inherent value (besides good conductivity and corrosion resistance), but it has immense *cultural* value, and of course it has that (cultural) value in all industrial nations.

But you know what else has immense cultural value, and carries that value to all industrial nations? US dollars.

&gt; If you see lot's and lot's of people 'hoard' gold you don't understand why it might be because you are missing a piece of the picture. That was the point of my comment.

Gold's value derives from the fact that it's rare, and it makes pretty jewelry. Having gold was a status symbol, and that made people want it. It's like diamonds in that way, in that there are a few good functional uses for diamonds (drilling through concrete, for instance), but their absurd price comes from marketing and market-manipulation creating demand for them. And indeed, US dollars have value for two reasons: taxes in the US are only accepted in dollars, and there's demand for dollars.

&gt; What surprises me is that people either consider status quo or complete apocalypse when talking about gold.

The collapse of the US dollar would require the collapse of the US, which would be an apocalypse. Admittedly, since you're apparently in the EU, I'd probably be hoarding gold, dollars, or (when yields go up) US Treasury bonds at this point.

&gt; If fiat is save but happily inflating away I'll have some of my money as gold as an inflation hedge ....

He has no comment on when white people appropriate ""ethnic"" wear (ie hipsters in LA with henna) but almost always focuses on the ""ethnic"" when witnessed on a person of said descent.

&gt;Are we talking about Common Law marriage, are we talking about Coverture? Are we talking about the Renaissance? Are we talking about Victorian England? The High middle ages? What?

Of course, you would be confused by the progress of human and individual rights over the course of two thousand years of human interaction in the West.  

&gt; I'll address one massive factual error. Women were never property. At worst they were wards like children are today.

The general tendency of human rights since the fall of the Roman Empire has been (with a few exceptions) towards more individual and human rights as time progressed.  If you look back to marriage and family law of ancient Rome, a wife certainly *was* property, along with her children, to the extent that a husband could in certain instances be judge, jury, and *executioner* to his entire family.  Did that statute remain static for 2000 years afterwards?  OF COURSE NOT.  But the foundational precepts of Roman law have remained a cornerstone of western marriage tradition.

&gt; I want you to attempt to prove your assertion that women were property with first order sources.

What??  Are you high?  I think you mean *secondary* sources here...

&gt; For example, you could attempt to find bills of sale from 'white female slave markets' in Europe

Oh.  No--you were trying to be serious.  Well, let me just hop on a plane to Avignon, take a few high quality pictures of some incredibly rare medieval French manuscripts about *femme sole* vs. *femme covert,* write a scholarly article about it, get it published, and then shove my personal copy of that article up your ass and light it on fire.  I'm not here to do your work for you.

Frankly, I'm boggled by the fact that you actually dispute the concept that women were property in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, when practically *everybody* except the pope was somebody's property.  It's so obscenely widely held that vassalage and peerage, apprenticeship, the Church, political leaders, the slave trade, witch-hunting manuals like the *Malleus Malificarum*, and other institutions had vastly restricted human rights for women, even below that of men, that you trying to deny it is an exceedingly extraordinary claim.  Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, so the onus is quite clearly on *you* to prove that women *weren't* property to be used at the behest of men, in the same way that men were property to be used at the behest of their noble lord, and later their state.

Please, tell me that [Lady Radegund](http://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/about-jesus-college/history/pen-portraits/st-radegund/) *wasn't* taken as a legal hostage and duly married in accordance with the Catholic Church in order to substantiate Frankish Catholicism in Thuringia in the 500's.  Please, inform me why the ancient tradition of [Turkish enslavement of Eastern European women](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_(Ottoman_Empire) ) (hey--they were white, too!) lasted until the 19th century, when those women obviously weren't being treated as property for the 2000 years prior.  I mean, it's not like we even get our term ""slave"" from [Slav](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery#Etymology), the group of haggard Eastern European tribes that were routinely pillaged for slaves, both male and female, during the Roman Empire and later Medieval courts.  

And please, provide me with some rationale for explaining why medieval marriage laws, vassalage, and peerage somehow did not apply to women, seeing as they were both bound by law courts, required to serve at the behest of their lords and ladies, and beholden to their guilds and nunneries.  I'm not saying that men didn't *also* have these same restrictions--they did.  But you're *insane* to think that the extreme dearth of individual freedom and self-determination that marks the slow crawl of western society out of the Dark Ages somehow managed to completely miss women, all the evidence to the contrary that has been piled up over decades of primary and secondary research.

I'm long silver myself, it's my only investment (Because I know gold and silver are in it's cycle and fiat currencies are having a crisis of confidence right now) But forcing hard money has been a bane in many an occasion. The destruction of colonial scrip, and the crime of 1873 are examples of this. Also, I've deduced that gold standards suck for the common man. Not only because of those aforementioned scenarios, but when used to represent gold and silver itself, governments will cheat gold, trying to issue more claim checks to gold (dollar bills) than there is actual gold in the vaults. They did it during the Bretton Woods system, they did it all over Europe during the world wars. It's why we're on a fiat standard now; Nixon de facto defaulted because of how the government kept cheating gold.

On the other hand, Keynesians have left me disappointed as well. I never understood the logic of throwing money at a failing system that, when even when you throw everything but the golden bars at the collapsing system, it still caves in on you. It's insanity in my eyes. The poster boy to him is of course, Paul Krugman, while wishing no disrespect to the man, his track record makes me seriously question his credibility as an expert and question whether he's a proxy of malicious system of propaganda.

6. I have a HUGE plot written down, but I'll summarize it:
""The brotherhood is getting more powerful every day- and they are using technology from the east and from Seattle to start becoming ferocious rulers of the wasteland. Meanwhile, ghouls living safely under the rainy cloud of radiation surrounding Seattle are holding back the Brotherhood paladins that want to take over the area. The player is a man who has a special pip boy that is connected to his body. The vault he lived in is filled with radiation, but the device implemented in the pip boy allows for radiation to make no effect on the pip boy. A sudden malfunction in the vault system EMPs the vault- shutting down most of the devices and turning most vault dwellers into ghouls. The player- who's pip-boy device is barely holding on escapes the vault. The player needs to repair the device before it shuts down- sending the radiation stored in it into his body and turning him into a ghoul. The brotherhood finds the player and his device- promising to repair it in return for him stepping into the radiated city and negotiating with the ghouls. The player, then, may choose to either help the ghouls protect themselves from the threat of the brotherhood- sacrificing himself for the innocent ghouls; or fighting against them in order to selfishly save himself. 

Like that idea? :D

Those are just two examples of mega businesses that accepted stimulus money and then went and created jobs overseas. Surely that's more of a giveaway to the rich than the tax cuts. You shouldn't be surprised about the jobs overseas, it's the essence of globalism, few corporations ever stray from what will make them the most money the easiest. 

A Chinese or European conspiracy would imply that there is some kind of secret exchange going on to ruin our economy. That's not true. There's a conspiracy, and there's really no secrets. The bankers made a gigantic profit off of the scandals that created the crisis, and then they made another gigantic profit off of the bailout. Oh, and they never got in trouble for any of it. That makes a lot of sense when you look at Obama's Goldman Sachs and Wachovia littered cabinet. Remember, even though the economy is doing really poorly right now, the fortune 500's profits are still on the rise. The big banks and mega corporations have no incentive for the United States or Europe to be doing well, and their actions reflect that. The less money the masses have, the more money the owned by the super rich. It's funny how people can justify bailout after bailout even though even it fails every time. Like Greece or Spain will never need another one of those.

""Burg"" originally meant fort, thus a burger is one who lives in the fort, or the city. 

Country once referred to a geographical unit, but is now used interchangeably with a ""state"". Unfortunately, in American parlance, a state (Michigan, for example) is now really just a province of the country and not an autonomous political unit of a federal system as it was imagined by many of the founders.

t3_jzxzf,0,c2gowlc,"(assuming JP3 scenario: Crashed on island w/ dinos in modern flora/fauna, isolated tropical island.)
Dinos: All the big A-listers.
Flora: Plains, groves, dense rainforest, aka large tropical island with a few biomes.
Native Fauna: We'll say a few species of snakes, a lot of birds, maybe some small rodents/cats, definitely crocs, maybe Komodo Dragons/Iguanas.

Goes for every location: You want to stay fairly close to the crash site(not too close with big predators inbound on the wind) what with sat locator beacons and whatnot.  Also make sure that while hidden from the fauna, that any airborn rescue teams can see you.  All animals naturally fear fire, particularly forest-going ones.
Water container: Turtle shell, piece of the wreck, pottery, (cliffside scenario can provide leather skins)

I'll break it down by location:

- Beach oceanside forest - Suicide - Any kind of large open area with water is going to attract the all the star players, so that is literally the last place you want to be.  Oceanside in lagoons, though natural fishing would be plentiful, the dangers from having all the main predators(both dinosaur, croc and sharks) there would make it a hard place to live for 3 years.  Ditto any kind of open plain.

- Cliffside -  Package A.  This could work very well, but it'd be a hard sell to solo it.  It'd be the ideal place for a small group to wait it out.  Ideally head for ending up on a cliff with a Pterandon rookery.  Fish-eating bird poop, although nasty nasty stuff to the nose, is well documented on being incredibly useful(fertilizer and more importantly, grade-a fire material)  Bonuses for eggs/hatchlings (though potentially risk &gt;&gt; reward there) If you took down an adult, you'd have beautiful skin to make clothing and all sorts of things(like a water skin).  HOWEVER: Danger of eating unknown meat as it could be poisonous(aka feed it first to mr drinking skull-mug there).  Best package: A.  (Needles can be made from bone)  Don't need ax to make shelter, and don't need machete to break through underbrush/hunt.  Hunting rifle could take down the leathery birds nicely.  Make sure to suspend some of the debris near cliff-side camp.  Getting water could be a very real problem, but various tropical plants could provide the necessary rainwater gathering to get you through.

- Coastal Rainforest swamp - Package B. Make shelter mid-tree w/ ax.  Main diet would be tropical fruit/nuts and fish you catch from sharpened wood/stone tipped spear.  The big threat is the crocs, as the main predatory dinos can't handle swamps(so no raptors or Trex)  Disease could be a problem tho.  By the end of 3 years tho, you could have the whole forest set up so you don't have to come down.

- Deep cave - Package B.  Make Sharpened logs to keep unwanted vistors out.  Keep fires going as much as possible.  Will keep all but the small ones out.  Food will be a problem as it means you have to leave the safety of the den out into the ground level of the forest.  &lt;- This IS the way our ancestors conquered a wild Europe.

- Deep Rainforest - Package B - Remember flowering plants didn't exist during the mesozoic, so the raptors would be at a disadvantage in extremely dense rainforest. (dense trees excludes the Trexes by default.)  As a species our main advantage is climbing trees here.  Basically the same as the coastal rainforest swamp.)

The reason is that untrained rescuers simply take too long to assess the pulse and hence delay beginning CPR; and while as Axxle says its not a difficult thing to check, for passers by who have never done it before, in an emergent and stressful setting, they simply do not do it right. The delay to starting effective compressions when they are indicated causes more harm than starting compressions when they are not.

Lay persons do NOT check for a pulse before starting CPR. That is consistent expert advice across the board.

Here is what climate scientist Edward Cook wrote regarding the accuracy of dendroclimatology:

Without trying to prejudice this work, but also because of what I
almost think I know to be the case, the results of this study will
show that we can probably say a fair bit about 100 year variability was like with any certainty (i.e. we know
with certainty that we know fuck-all).

From the climategate [emails](http://www.eastangliaemails.com/emails.php?eid=356&amp;filename=1062592331.txt)

and after the email were uncovered here is Phil Jones on the same subject:

There is a debate over whether the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) was global or not. If it were to be conclusively shown that it was a global phenomenon, would you accept that this would undermine the premise that mean surface atmospheric temperatures during the latter part of the 20th Century were unprecedented?

There is much debate over whether the Medieval Warm Period was global in extent or not. The MWP is most clearly expressed in parts of North America, the North Atlantic and Europe and parts of Asia. For it to be global in extent the MWP would need to be seen clearly in more records from the tropical regions and the Southern Hemisphere. There are very few palaeoclimatic records for these latter two regions.

Of course, if the MWP was shown to be global in extent and as warm or warmer than today (based on an equivalent coverage over the NH and SH) then obviously the late-20th century warmth would not be unprecedented. On the other hand, if the MWP was global, but was less warm that today, then current warmth would be unprecedented.

We know from the instrumental temperature record that the two hemispheres do not always follow one another. We cannot, therefore, make the assumption that temperatures in the global average will be similar to those in the northern hemisphere.

from the [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8511670.stm)

So Phil Jones is unsure if the MWP was global in extent and Edward Cook thinks we have very little idea at all. Perhaps the certainty expressed by some alarmists is overstated.

Suarez can play behind the striker, but I find him better as the out-and-out striker. In any case, he will be asked to do both, and that will take a toll on him physically, especially when you consider the fact that he has not had much rest over the summer. 

Downing too can play behind the striker, but that leaves our left wing empty. 

That leaves Henderson and Jonjo. Henderson has been played on the right so far, and has yet to get a chance to impress in a more central position for Liverpool. Jonjo has not impressed me at all in the games that I've seen him play. I'm not knocking either of them, they may well develop into very good players, but this is early times. 

The problems, if you want to call them that, that I listed are more for the future than for now. Our squad is pretty good enough for this season, considering we are not in Europe.

For my own part, I am strongly of the opinion that so long as we agree on a common goal (say, ""How can we relieve the most suffering in the world?"") we can rationally arrive at a system of ethics, and therefore politics, that achieves that goal most efficiently.

Is that appropriate here?"") than it is to follow a set of proscriptions laid down by somebody else--but that is the better path, and often the necessary one.

Many words have become capsules, so when politicians speak about them, it's about nothing - the most prominent example being ""education"". And *if* nowadays they mean something by education, it's not the traditional meaning, but what I would call *""coaching""*. This is what was meant by this word until it got all fucked up and actually should only have been used with quotation marks for the last 50 years: http://concrescence.org/index.php/ajpt/article/view/92

In the case that words don't lose their meaning, it's replaced by something else. What I found extremely shocking is the way republicans spit out the word *""socialist""* like in ""Is Warren Buffett a complete socialist?!"" ! This is what's happening to all of the established nations. Now, personally I think ideologies are bullshit, because there are many more dimensions to politics than left and right, libertarian and authoritarian, but if I had to force my values, which I try to direct by just pure critical rationalism, into this landscape, I would be on what's considered to be the on the authoritarian right on most issues. Still, I think socialism is a very important concept that needs to be embraced and not completely abjected. It'll be hard for Americans to make changes into that direction simply because of the corruption of this word. Many people don't realize how shitty shit would actually be without that safety net. But don't worry, my friends from the US, shit is equally fucked up in Europe, too.

Please tell me if I'm wrong, but in the US it seems that the politicians that are labeled ""Liberal"" are simply doing the logical things, while their counterparty is not. There needs to be another phase of enlightenment.

Techno and house are simultaneously interchangeable and significantly different, if that makes any sense.  The line is often blurred, and even as a DJ and producer of both styles for the last decade, it's hard for me to strictly define most tracks as one or the other, particularly as the 21st century has progressed. 

Techno is not necessarily faster, nor is it always ""mechanical"" in sound, although it is safe to say it is often more percussion-driven and focused on more complex sound design (from a producers' standpoint, interesting and experimental use of FX, modulations, and processing techniques--although that's not to say house does not have good or complex sound design involved), whereas house is typically more reliant on chords, melodies, vocals, funk, and more traditional song arrangement. Both styles can be produced with either synthesized sounds from drum machines and synthesizers, or sample-based. 

Throughout the '90s and *early* 2000s, both styles (along with most electronic dance music, in general) had faster tempos, reaching as high as 140bpm (and beyond that, even, but new sub-genres emerged at that point, such as schranz, hard house, gabber, etc.) As electronic dance music fell by the wayside with the general populace (particularly Americans), tempos began to make their way back to the 120s, where you'll find the majority of material produced these days (even epic/popular/commercial trance, which was notoriously 135+ has rested around 128 over the last 5 years or more). In fact, house, and some techno producers, are pushing as low as 110-115. Not to digress, but my theory is that with the advancement in music production technology, it's become ""easier"" to create intensity and ""strength"" in music, without relying on faster, and faster tempos.

These days, the lines are blurred more than ever, and frankly, don't really matter. Music is erroneously categorized, and one man's ""techno"" could be another's ""progressive house."" And with time, trends change, fads come and go, and yesterday's tech-house could be today's techno. For example, modern progressive house tends to take a lot of the percussive drive and shuffle of the latter part of the 2005-2009 ""minimal"" movement, but adds healthy helpings of white noise builds, melodic synthesizers, and longer breakdowns--where in 1996, progressive house would be more similar to dubby, dark trance with loopy vocals, and a slower tempo. 

Essentially, what I'm saying is that are few rules, absolutely no ""authority"" and what few ""assumed"" rules there may be, are constantly broken, merging new and old styles together, and creating new ones. As the technology marches forward, things change. Old terms are co-opted for new movements.

As far as references go, here's my take on the sounds with some descriptors of what I associate when I hear (warning, this shit is for those with an open mind, and unattached to fame, glory, money, sunglasses, bitches, hoes, fake tits and the cheesy hooks associated, i.e. this is the real shit):

Let's move on to ""house."" man this is going to be even worse to categorize than the others, and by now, you should start really seeing the overlap I was discussing before, and how it's tough to define stuff. You could call some of the above house. Because really, it is. But some if it's just slower, dubbed-out, slightly funkier techno...who the fuck cares? It's all house or techno to me, and it'll all fit in the same set with the right crowd. Anyway, HOUSE:

Ok, I had fun going through this list. I'm not even gonna bother with electro house, trance, etc. Not because I'm a hater, but because the shit I just dropped is enough to put you in the right place. If you don't like it now, you'll either grow to, or you're just one of those people who has inherently bad taste, and can never be fixed.

When I debate religious people I don't argue over whether belief in god helps them ""navigate the world day to day""--I argue over whether it's true.  That's what I'm concerned about: it's usefulness is discovering the truth.

We could have a separate debate on whether philosophy helps people ""navigate the world day to day"" (meaning, I suppose, that it gives them the calming misperception that 'values' [like the Golden Rule perhaps] exist in nature).

Science (as we know it) probably wouldn't exist without Philosophy.  But science probably also wouldn't exist if it wasn't for Greek commerce in the 4th century BC, the Black Plague in the 1300's, the Italian system of patronage, and the development of nation-states in Northern Europe.  Besides, I don't care whether science developed from philosophy: chemistry developed from alchemy and astronomy developed from astrology.  There were holdouts in alchemy for a very long time, and there are holdouts in philosophy today.

""Scientists are still working to solve questions raised by Descartes.""
This is actually a recurring joke in the scientific community.  Non-cognitive scientists often refer to the 'continuing problem of Cartesian dualism' and we have many witty remarks about how that problem was solved over a hundred years ago.  Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker have some particularly funny remarks about this specific topic.

So your thesis is now that science wouldn't exist if philosophers didn't exist to ask questions like ""what is consciousness...?""  I don't even know how to begin to respond to this.  I could point to the fact that consciousness is a scientific question, or that we actually know quite a lot about it, or that scientists are the ones asking and answering the questions and that Philosophers are the only people so arrogant as to try to claim scientific discoveries as their own...

""scientists are deeply entrenched in their own paradigms and rarely question the underlying assumptions of those paradigms""
This shows a profound lack of knowledge about the scientific culture.  I don't know how many conferences you've attended, but one of the overarching themes of every interaction is people willfully expressing open-mindedness and lack of confidence about their own beliefs.  This is, again, something that would be laughed at if you repeated it among a collection of researchers.

""it is always attributed to a philosopher or a philosophically minded scientist""  I don't know how you can get more arrogant than this.  It's EXACTLY like the religious folk who claim that all scientific values come from the Bible.  You are using exactly the same words as Christian fundamentalists.

And again, when a philosopher answers a scientific question that answer is not suddenly transported to the ethereal world of philosophy because of proximity to the beliefs of its progenitor.  Philosophers can discover scientific answers, but that doesn't make it philosophy!  Mendel (a monk) discovered genetics, but that doesn't mean that genetics is a branch of Christianity!

I was *mostly* speaking of Christianity there. As I say, I *don't* know much about Orthodox Judaism, though I'm skeptical of religion generally and orthodox religion particularly. But I have generally found (at least, with Christianity, and I am pretty sure this applies to Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and any other complex religious tradition) that the intellectual sophistication within a particular religion's belief system is satisfying only to adherents of that religion. Jews tend not to be impressed by Thomas Aquinas and Paul of Tarsus; Christians tend not to be impressed by the scholars of the Talmud or the great ethicists and theologans of Islam, etc. Atheists like me don't find any of it particularly interesting, because all such theories and justifications and systems of thought ultimately depend on fundamental assumptions I simply don't share, vis-a-vis the existence of God and the soul. [PZ Myers](http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/12/the_courtiers_reply.php) puts it more condescendingly than I would, but the essential point--what within one tradition appears to be complex and interesting outside of it seems rather flat--stands.

&gt;You decide to not be an ass

I think this type of scam is so effective because it is preying on visitors trying not to live up to the **bad tourist** image.  You are a visitor in a strange place, and you may feel a bit awkward not being able to speak the local language and bumping around with all of these other foreigners who stick out like a sore thumb.  You see other tourists grunting and speaking loudly to merchants in a clearly insensitive manner.  The thought of having to deal with throngs of people like you in your local country makes you feel even less pleased with yourself.

And suddenly, an opportunity to turn the tide appears.  You can perform a small gesture to prove that you are not an insensitive, selfish clod.  You have the opportunity to be a good ambassador in this strange land!

And then it all goes south.  

Your effort to be altruistic and charitable has turned into a humiliating (at best) episode.  Now, not only do you feel much much worse about yourself for having been scammed, you have gained a negative experience easily turned into personal contempt for the country, the people, traveling in general, etc etc.  

For me the thing to remember is that these scams happen everyday in your own town/city but not only are you probably not a preferred target and you know how to avoid them.

In Belgium and France, births at less than 26 weeks of pregnancy are registered as lifeless. And some countries don't reliably register babies who die within the first 24 hours of birth. Thus, the United States is sure to report higher infant mortality rates. For this very reason, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which collects the European numbers, warns of head-to-head comparisons by country. 

Having said that in other stats, Cancer, for example the Europeans do not record a patient as a cancer sufferer until the have a full blown neo-plasm. The US record potential cancers as cancer. particularly prostate. thus the US has a much better cancer record than Europe. however, if you record the mortality rate deads per capita. the USA is slightly worse.  

Its a dark world health stats.  Overall, the US is as good as any European country, theres not much in it, the astonishing thing is the cost per capita. Its well over DOUBLE the European average. USA is paying for a Rolls Royce and getting a standard town car. Europeans are paying for a standard town car and getting a standard town car.        
      
I might as well add that health care being ""free at the point of delivery"" is a great idea.  It really must take a lot of stress away.

Edit: Cancer citations and whatnot.

A quick look at the cancer figures show the 52% of female UK patients and 44% of males survive (2003 figs) survive 5 years compared to 62/66 for the USA. 
All well and good but the diagnosis rates of cancer are far higher in the USA, 470 per 100K V 370 per 100K in the UK.  **27% higher**.
Thats odd. 
The reason is Europeans do not diagnose cancer as being cancer until it is a full blown neo-plasm.

The mortality rate, the numbers who die of cancer per year tell a different story. 190 per 1000 die of cancer per year in the USA and 180 per year in the UK.  Statistically insignificant.  ( I've shown the UK and USA here as we can read English, France does better )

Edit: I've been checking my figures.  [Here's a better graph,](http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/hea_dea_fro_can-health-death-from-cancer) the USA is about average which is about right but the figures arn't close to the UK and US cancer stats from their health depts.

Christians had the complete run of Europe in parallel to the Arabs Caliphate during the dark ages.  It would be impossible to ""view the pursuit of scientific knowledge as an important"" and to have come up with absolutely **NOTHING** in terms of science for nearly a thousand years.  Christian Europe of the year 500 knew exactly the same thing as Christian Europe of the year 1200.  Not one single equation or principle of physics, science, medicine, biology, mathematics, astronomy came out of Europe during this time.  While at the same time, nearly every Greek text was being rewritten with new discoveries and analysis over in the Arabic empire (including the scientific method, algebra, the start of chemistry, the first theory of optics, a mapping of the human circulatory system, a complete revision of the Ptolemaic planetary system, a position-based number system, etc).

Even having established Universities as a system of learning the Europeans could not actually make any progress.  Why is that?  You just have to look at the actual curriculum of those Universities.  It was &gt; 50% religion.  And the rest was *pre*-Greek garbage.

When they recovered Aristotle, they invented ""Scholasticism"" (which today is just called ""Apologetics"") from which they made the oh so useful contribution to society called ""Ontological arguments"".  If they had really embraced logic for what it was, then why didn't they invent boolean logic (a very obvious next step) or algorithms?

They also bought into Aristotle's cosmology which supported a geocentric model of the universe, without any analysis whatsoever.  On this flimsy authority by association reasoning (and oh what an impressive demonstration of their understanding of his logic) they tried Galileo for supporting the Copernican/Aristarchus heliocentrism.  You don't find similar persecutions of science in other religions.

The Christians lost the knowledge of how to build aqueducts -- an important city design technology.  And in 700 years since the fall of the Roman Empire they were unable to recover or rediscover this fundamental idea.

These were the most backward people in the world.  And they *STILL ARE*.  They has centuries to try to improve their lot and they could do nothing without stealing knowledge from the outside.  The only thing that turned Europe around was a few curious kings basically *extracting* the knowledge of science from the Arabs, followed by the rise of humanism, empiricism and the corresponding rise of secularism.  They only started making their *own* discoveries in the 1500s.

Why was Peter Abelard persecuted by the church authority of the dark ages, when Thomas Hobbes was only censored?  By the time of Hobbes, the church's grip had loosened, as secularism was on the rise.  You were allowed to think, and respond to internal desires to satisfy one's curiosity, because the culture allowed for it, over the continuous objections of the fading church.

There's case after case of this.

The foundations of optics, mathematics, chemistry and history all come from the Arabs, the Greeks and the Hindus.  And yes, sometimes they were very religious.  But not Christian.  At least not until they could inherit a science that had already embraced empiricism (and therefore secularism) when their thinking could be mechanically removed from their religion.

This lead to the concept of ""compartmentalization"" as a way for the religious to participate in science.  I.e., acting as secularists when science was involved, since the content of Christianity is completely incompatible with science.

The foreigners got to live in the good, spacious, newly renovated rooms while the Russians were crammed in the small ones. The Chinese got the same treatment as the Russians and also had to live in tiny rooms and use the dirty bathrooms and kitchens.

The main activity outside of going to class was drinking. (I learned over the course of the year that stereotypes for Russia are true most of the time.) Six months of the year it's too cold to go outside, so it's easier to open up a bottle of vodka and drink. Plus it's a great way to get familiar with other people and to practice your Russian. 

I have to say that I thought the whole experience was going to be more 'extreme', but all in all life was pretty similar to where I'm from. (Western Europe). Yes, it's cold, but people have high speed internet, go to the same stores, watch the same movies, listen to the same music. There's a lot of poverty though. It was only on the countryside that I had pretty huge culture shock. In some villages they didn't have running water and I suppose nothing much had changed in comparison to 100 years ago.

&gt;National Registry of EMT's Implementation of
2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and Emergency Cardiovascular Care

&gt;In consideration for implementation of the recently released 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for CPR and Emergency Cardiovascular Care, the NREMT has completed a review of the available published documents to date.  The NREMT Standards &amp; Examination Committee has discussed the impact of the recommended changes to our national EMS certification materials.  We recognize the projected implementation plans, instructor updates, and anticipated publication of all related AHA educational support materials.  Consequently, the NREMT will be implementing all associated recommendations of the AHA Guidelines 2010 for CPR and Emergency Cardiovascular Care as of November 1, 2011 (Paramedic only) and January 1, 2012 (all other levels).
The NREMT will continue to require that all candidates for national EMS certification by the NREMT possess a current and valid CPR credential equivalent to the AHA's CPR for Healthcare Provider.   Therefore, the remainder of this discussion will highlight our understanding of the more significant changes contained in the 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for CPR and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.
 
&gt;Basic Life Support
 
&gt;Perhaps the most significant changes from previous AHA recommendations have occurred in Basic Life Support.  Immediate recognition of cardiac arrest is the first link in the ""Chain of Survival.""  However, the A-B-C (Airway, Breathing, Chest compressions) sequence for CPR has been changed to reflect a C-A-B (Chest compressions, Airway, Breathing) sequence in all patients except newly born infants.  EMS professionals should not confuse this new sequence for CPR with the age-old A-B-C (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) order for patient assessment.  The C-A-B sequence mnemonic for CPR is to reinforce the need to begin chest compressions as quickly as possible in any patient who has suffered sudden cardiac arrest.  AHA Guidelines 2010 recommend that each cycle of CPR begins with chest compressions and not ventilations.  Healthcare providers should be able to immediately assess an unresponsive patient and quickly determine sudden cardiac arrest based on the following findings:

&gt;Patient responsiveness

&gt;Absence of breathing or abnormal breathing, i.e., gasping or agonal respirations


&gt;**Pulse check for no more than 10 seconds**

Source: http://www.nremt.org/nremt/about/2010_aha_guidelines.asp


Those are the guidelines that I follow, not European guidelines.

Also, if I don't agree with the guidelines, there is nothing wrong with me saying that I disagree with them and why I disagree with them. This is a science subreddit after all.

My stance is the following: Layperson that has never had training, CAB style CPR. Person with CPR certification: ABC with pulse check.

If everyone knew how to do CPR correctly then the world would be a much better place.

Lets refrain from the personal attacks. Just because I'm ""just an EMT"" doesn't mean that I cannot question or disagree with guidelines. But also remember that personally and professionally, I answer do a different set of guidelines. I answer to the National Standard of Emergency Medical Technicians standards, not the European standards.

t3_k10zk,0,c2gq0cd,"Having been in the past a hardcore meat-eater who was mildly annoyed at vegetarianism (okay strongly, although I never ridiculed anyone for it, I just had irrational thoughts about it and discussed it with fellow meat-eaters -I was a member of a paying 'community' website where our meat-lovers group was deleted in favour of the vegetarian group for example), I think this whole 'it's because they know deep down that they are wrong' is for most cases just wishful thinking on the parts of vegetarians/vegans.

Many people still have no idea that industry farming is that bad; I was a pretty bright kid and it didn't properly occur to me until a year or two ago. I've always loved animals and we had plenty of pets but it was never difficult (at that time) for me to disassociate 'meat' with 'fluffly bunny' and yes I even ate rabbit (it's common here, we had it at the school cafeteria). Now consider that plenty of people don't grow up with animals, don't ever visit friends who have farms, go pony-riding etc. and really don't 'get' animals and the human love and fascination for them; it would be even less of an issue for those people.

I felt irrationally uneasy with my vegetarian flatmates because I kept thinking she was going to jump up on me cooking a steak and tell me 'you shouldn't do that', and act like my mother. It was never because I thought 'I don't want to be reminded that I'm doing something ethically questionable'. The minute that realization occured to me (and I can't stress enough how much I loved meat), I went vegetarian; if most felt like that deep-down, they wouldn't be able to stand eating meat. I actually feel like if I had seen some of the footage I've seen now, I would have gone vegetarian sooner.

Again, I wish it was because people deep-down were ethically tormented but from my experience, it just isn't. But that's a good thing because it means if people are better informed, they might start thinking about it; this is why I support charities that try to regulate industry farming and get rid of added cruelty. Pushing for that stuff to be in the mainstream media and making people understand that it affects their health is the way to go -people being sensitive towards animal rights might not be very widespread but the desire to not eat meat or milk that's been pumped with chemicals an antibiotics certainly is). That's largely why I encourage all my friends to go for free-range meat, it doesn't make a huge difference but it makes them gain interest in what they're eating and where it comes from which can then lead to other concerns. I went for free-range before going veg and very few people are capable of such drastic changes to their lifestyle.

Going back to the media point, about half-a year ago, one of the organisations I was supporting gained huge momentum, tv and newspaper attention when they set up a demonstration against forthcoming EU legislation to ratify the trade of clonned meat. This is what we need more of. 

Lastly, and to go back to your question, I think for most people the 'anti-veg' thing has to do with:

1. not liking other people telling you how to live your life (just look at how strongly people feel about opposing political ideas). 

2. Rejection of status quo. The negative reactions I get to being veg are akin to the ones I get when I say I'm not interested in getting married or having kids. Why wouldn't you do what everyone else is doing naturally and follow human nature? Why are you transgressing the unwritten but approved by most humans to have-ever lived, rules of society? Why are you trying to be different to us? is what I think is on most people's minds.

If it was just defensiveness for something they feel guilty about, most of them would be vegetarian.",12,True,1314871022,,12,,True,Gourmay,0,,1427545391,t1_c2gq0cd,0,t3_k10zk,vegetarian,t5_2qm7x,False

And this democracy failed many times. In the 18th century, it led to anarchy and rebellions, and later to the partitions of Poland and disappearance of the whole country, which was captured by the less democratic countries for sure. After it was rebuild in the interwar period, Pi≈Çsudski, our national hero who had a strong involvement in gaining indepencence and estabilishment of a republic in 1918, overthrew the government by force in 1926, which made Poland essentially a dictatorship, because of the fact that the democracy worked badly. Nowadays, it also works badly and most of the people realize that, but despite this fact the current estabilishment gets nearly all of the votes, because ""the other parties have no chance of getting into parliament"". And I think we will have another dictator some day.

&gt; You argue that gold has inherent value

No I don't and neither do most gold-bugs. It's kind of frustrating to take so much time to write posts that say the exact opposite and have you respond with that. NOTHING has inherent value.


&gt; Gold's value derives from the fact that it's rare

No, it does not derive value from it's rarity. If it has value at all it's because people find it useful. It's not my place to judge why it's useful to them. I happen to know that some of that usefulness comes from gold having properties that make it ideal as a medium of exchange. So people find gold useful as money therefore I find it useful as money. For more details: [Mises](http://mises.org/rothbard/money.pdf) **PDF warning**. Yeah, yeah Austrians and their wacky induction, I know ...

&gt; The collapse of the US dollar would require the collapse of the US

Depending on what you mean by US, it really doesn't. There'd be some disruption for sure but everyone with a positive balance in terms of non-dollar assets can carry on selling, producing, lending, farming etc. So not complete collapse. Depending on what the government does next it doesn't have to be a total catastrophe. Of course, disaster can always be manufactured for example when the state tries to reign in inflation with price controls.

&gt; Admittedly, since you're apparently in the EU, I'd probably be hoarding gold, dollars, or (when yields go up) US Treasury bonds at this point.

Had a good laugh at that. Dollars and bonds? Why would I trust the FED over the ECB? Both are central planners that, as was inevitable, painted themselves into a corner where there only options are deep recession or printing money? Bonds? I will never, ever lend money to a sovereign. I'm not going to be the bag-holder for the failed big-gov't utopia. Central banking and fiat money have run it's course and are about to fail spectacularly. That's my believe and of course people sharing that believe is why gold is at the price it's at. However, once the state abandons it's failed fiat currency the worst of the pain will be over. Until then, I stock beans, bullions and I would stock bullets if that were allowed here.

&gt; Inflation (in the US) tends in the 2% to 3% range, which is pretty bad as an investment return.

An inflation hedge is not an investment that's why it's called an inflation hedge and not investment. By the way, actual inflation is probably [closer](http://bpp.mit.edu/usa/) to 4% at the moment and that's in an environment that allegedly should be hugely deflationary. So, how about you let me know when you've found an investment that is as safe as gold @ 2 year ZIRP and returns &gt;4% .

In America, if you get an infection after your stay, it can be considered hospital acquired. Didn't get it for a week after you left? Hospital acquired. Had surgery and the wound got infected because you didn't follow you post-op orders? Hospital acquired. And it may be the same in Europe, but the reason I say this is because I doubt the numbers in Europe are being reported to have a more favorable ratio. However, I'm inclined to believe that the reason the ratio is higher in America is actually because the infection rate is *lower*.

Why is that? Well lets consider America's healthcare system. Fewer healthy people will make visits to the ER and doctors because of higher costs. Typically when Americans finally do go to the doctor, their health has already deteriorated to a point well past when they should have gone. Their health is already extremely compromised, which means if they do get a infection, its impact will be more significant. What it also tells me is that much healthier people are getting infections in Europe (probably because people are less likely to hesitate because of costs, but we at least know more people are surviving the infections indicating better overall health). But in America, it's extremely uncommon for healthy people to get infections at all. This makes me wonder: why are so many healthier people getting infections in Europe? Or are Americans spreading more serious diseases, or are they just so unhealthy it's that bad? Of those options, the most likely reason is that more healthier Europeans are getting infections.

And in fact, after looking at some data, it appears that infection rates actually are higher in Europe:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18926310

t3_k169i,0,c2gqahs,"&gt; So why do wages keep increasing?

Good question, and the simply answer it, because clubs keep offering it.

In another sense, football is a career for the players and a player realistically have 20 years or so to maximise his/her earning potential, thus with the commercialisation of football comes image rights, TV money, merchandising, etc and all those mean a club's earning is more than just tickets and prize money. For example, [almost half of Liverpool's revenue comes from overseas market](http://footballdynamicsasia.blogspot.com/2011/07/liverpool-earns-nearlty-half-of-its.html) and they sure aren't those going to the kop week in and week out.

So, with clubs now earning more, players think they should as well, since they are themselves a driving brand and reason for the club and thus agents are able to use this to justify the wage structure.

Also, as money began to roll into football, you find more teams are able to afford better players and challenge for competition, yet there are only so much proper world/top class players in the world. If you consider that you might only see say 20 top class players for each position (which is a stretch), there are only about 220 top class players available for the 100 clubs in the top European leagues alone. Thus, demand is more than supply.

The idea is, as a low table club, your team would not be able to cope with a 'tiki-taka' style, thus while you can afford a couple (midfielders) of those, a majority of your players are very limited in their skills and footballing brains, so they should not get more time on the ball.

* I doubt many would be interested in setting up their own training system, so go download a decent one and use that.

* Find a bigger team / better league and just look at their reserve team and just offer loan deals, you might pick up some gems that is crucial to your team plus it would not eat into your wage budget

* Look for decent backroom staff, there is a [formula on getting 5* coaches](http://www.sortitoutsi.net/forum/topic/38263-5-star-coaching-formula/), but let's not get your hope too high. For assistant manager, I like one that offer high Man Management, Motivation (for your team talk suggestions) and Tactical Knowledge (to offer you criticism on your tactics) though it pretty much depends on the type of manager you are
* Go to your board and ask them for a Parent club, better scout system, training, etc... just try your luck but don't push it

* Note down the free transfer / club release dates are they offer plenty of good youth/experience players on the cheap, but offer those players trial instead of signing them on straight, as some times they will want more money if you sign them straight than after a week or two of trials

* Quickly offload useless players, they take up wages that can be channeled to other more critical areas

* Arrange tons of friendlies, the earlier ones with big team at home (to rake in the cash) and last few with smaller clubs that you will beat easily (to build morale) prior to start of the season",1,True,1314878982,452,1,,False,mefuzzy,0,Selangor FA,1427545555,t1_c2gqcoi,0,t3_k158e,soccer,t5_2qi58,False

I don't understand how some are ready to deny the basics of the economy only to push their Big Govt/leftist agenda. Every single country who has cut the taxes experienced an economic growth in normal times and a smaller recession in times of crisis. 

Ever heard of China's ""Free economic zones"" established by Deng Xiaoping back when China was dirt poor? Countries like Japan or Switzerland have low taxes some countries in the EU have a flat tax. 


Here's a list of studies:


&gt;These findings imply that in our contemporary era of large government, high taxes lead to lower economic growth. When taxes go up, the growth in the income of taxpayers should decline. 

..........

&gt;Cashin (1995) found that each one percent increase in taxes as a percent of total output lowers output per worker by about two percent. To be sure, he observes positive effects of spending from taxes, but typically the positive spending effects are only about onehalf as large as the negative tax effect, which is about the same thing as saying that private sector spending is twice as productive as public sector outlays. A new study by Holcombe and Lacombe (2001) compares counties on both sides of state borders - and observes that high taxes impede growth.

..........

&gt;Using a complex general equilibrium model, German economist Bernhard
Heitger (1993) concluded that for ‚Äúthe most important OECD countries, taxation turns out to be growth-retarding. ‚Äú Roubini, Milesi and Gian (1998) concluded that ‚ÄúIn general, the taxation of factor incomes...is growth-reducing.‚Äù

.........

&gt;[For the USA] The results ( Figure 3) show that the low tax states outperformed the high tax states by either measure. Income per person rose by 135 percent from 1957 to 1997 in the low tax states, compared with 120 percent in the high tax ones. Using the broader measure of growth, real personal income rose dramatically more in the low tax states, going up by an average of 315 percent, compared with 268 percent in the high tax jurisdictions. This implies that not only were individuals benefitting from faster income growth in the low tax states, but also that population growth was larger in the jurisdictions with lower tax burdens. In general, the lower the tax burden, the higher the rate of economic growth.

............


&gt;Looking first (figure 4) at the entire period 1957 to 1997, per capita real income growth was substantially higher (138 vs. 115 percent) in the 10 states with the lowest increases in tax burden compared with the 10 states with the greatest increase.

...........


&gt;While Sweden (and indeed virtually all continental Western European countries) were increasing their welfare states massively and increasing taxes from an already high 40.7 percent of total output in 1970 to 52.1 percent in l999, the British were revolting against the continued expansion of government, and the aggregate tax burden actually fell (modestly, to be sure) from 1970 to 1999. By the latter year, the British tax burden was 30 percent lower than that in Sweden, and about 20 percent below major European nations such as France. As a consequence, economic growth fell sharply in most Western European nations ‚Äì but not in England. The fiscal revolution that began with Margaret Thatcher in 1979 was not reversed after she left office in 1990. Britain went from being the tired old lady of Europe to being an engine of growth.

As I see it there are two sides to the obesity epedemic of the west: 1) Abundance of resources and 2) a change in culture (eating habits, laziness, food trends, etc). The first is obvious. Europeans and Americans alike are getting fatter because we can, we have the money and do little physical work in general. The second is where America comes in to play it's part. American culture has been spread worldwide along with American products such as movies, music, clothing and food. This all happende largely because of America's dominating position in the West after the Second World War. America developed the rising youth culture in the fifthies as teenagers became a money spending democraphic, spawning new products or even industries. As the wealth grew elsewhere the youth wanted to copy their American forerunners. One industry that seemed to flourish in the new American economic climate was the fast food industry. Most foreign food you see in my country, Norway, has been McDonaldized*, du partially misuse a term by George Ritzer.

t3_k193y,0,c2gqmtj,"Victor David Hanson wrote about this as well in *Carnage and Culture*.  The book was probably written in large part as a counterpoint to Guns Germs and Steel, and this chapter was particularly good.  

Hanson acknowledges the physical and emotional damage done to the Mexica by plague, and the advantages of horses, muskets, and swords.  But, the fall of Tenochitilian came after months of hard struggle, and Hanson describes Cortez and his men as the best trained, most experienced knights of Europe.  The conquistadors had a different concept of warfare than the Aztecs.  The Aztecs were experienced in [Flower Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower_war) which were small skirmishes that ended with taking sacrificial captives.  The Spaniards, on the other hand, methodically demolished the basis of Aztec civilization and slaughtered the people. 

I'll sketch another of Hanson's examples, as it makes his argument succinctly.  At the Battle of Isandlwanda, the English were deployed with lax discipline, and a larger Zulu force with far less sophisticated weapons overwhelmed them.  But a few days later, at Rorke's drift, a tiny force of colonists maintained discipline, fought with what Hanson describes as ""the Western way of War"", and resisted a Zulu attack despite being much more severely outnumbered than at Isandlwanda. 

I really suggest reading Carnage and Culture.  Hanson looks at a number of the most decisive battles, and describes how Western strategy and social organization enabled them to triumph.  Hanson himself is a neocon, but his classical scholarship is outstanding, and offers some of the best insight possible into the deep underpinnings of that way of thinking.  Any Roman Senator would have agreed with Hanson's ideas.

I don't believe that Hanson's book even comes close to invalidating Diamond's thesis, if that was even his intention.  But it is a great counterpoint, showing how a civilization that rewards individual initiative but fights as a cohesive unit is a terrible adversary.

(but I guess so does every league so it's a small excuse, for a otherwise large problem). Long story.
 The problem at WC 10' was we didn't have a world class goalkeeper for starters to take us to the final (I mean, name a team that has won the WC with a dodgy goalkeeper, don't say Barthez). We lost Ferdinand in the first week, so we lost our captain (granted Stevie G was excellent and should of remained for me, captain) and a defender of top class whom I'm sure wouldn't of let us get shanked as bad as we did in that game against Germany. (Granted Upson got the only goal but w.e, we should have had two). Rooney has never really had a partner up front, but with Carroll, Welbeck, and maybe Bent, we may have something to look forward too. 
Never understood the England midfield, some games we dominate, sometimes we look like a bunch of school boys all chasing a ball or ball watching, especially when we have had top players like Gerrard, Lampard, Carrick, Beckham, Cole, Scholes ect.

Book 1: Emerson's Arithmetic

If the covers are intact and the binding is somewhat together, value would be somewhere between $20-30 USD. There's a copy of the [second series](http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=2745288478&amp;searchurl=an%3Demerson%26bi%3D0%26bx%3Doff%26ds%3D30%26recentlyadded%3Dall%26sortby%3D17%26sts%3Dt%26tn) on Abe, but it doesn't provide much information.

Book 2: Murphy's Lucian

If the cover is just a bit loose, it won't hurt the value much. If it is bound in the original publisher's cloth (usually black or grey) it will add a bit of value. I wasn't able to find a copy from that exact year, but more than likely it's the same edition as [this version](http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=1047998683&amp;searchurl=an%3Dmurphy%26bi%3D0%26bx%3Doff%26ds%3D30%26recentlyadded%3Dall%26sortby%3D1%26tn%3Dlucian%26x%3D0%26y%3D0), just a European edition. I'd actually give yours a bit more value, as it was probably printed from the original plates, and not an American copy of the plates. US reproduction plates from 1815 to about 1844 were not the best quality, and the book produced from them were often a little shabby and hard to read.

Book 3: Gradus ad Parnassum

Shame about the cover. You can get it rebound for about $150; in a fully restored state, it would be worth about $250 USD. [Here's a quick list](http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?bi=0&amp;bx=off&amp;ds=30&amp;recentlyadded=all&amp;sortby=1&amp;sts=t&amp;tn=Gradus+ad+Parnassum&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;yrh=1820&amp;yrl=1800) of similar editions.

Book 4: TACITI HISTORIARUM

I don't see a lot of antiquarian copies of this available, but a lot of reproductions. The older copies are going for $35-$65, but if I'm correct, that one doesn't have a cover, which hurts the value quite a bit. As is, $15

Book 5: Opera Interpretatione Et Notis

Looks like that copy is a little worn, but not too awful. Found a slightly earlier copy [here](http://www.abaa.org/books/251542165.html). That edition is a bit older, but more worn - split the difference and I think you have a reasonable value.

Book 6: Elements

This book is always in demand, I get collectors looking for older copies all the time. This particular edition looks like it has seen better days, and that will cut the value in half or so.

Another thing that makes him look worse then he is, is that our coach always choose Bendtner, even when he is not fit and that have made him look worse then he is. We have other good strikers to choose from that would fit better then Bendtner against some opponents. 

On another note I think Arsenal butchered Bendtner and Arsene Wenger is playing him totally wrong. Bendtner should not be in Arsenal, but in some mid table team instead and should be played more as an Andy Carroll kind of strike, and not a Van Persie kind of striker or winger. He totally does not fit into Arsenals short passing, work the ball in to the box kind of play, he should be playing on a team that rapes the ball forward with a lot of crossing and long passes into the box ala Stoke.

I don't know if you have somewhere to stay or if you will be at a hostel but I can say that 50 dollars a day will be a damn-near impossibility if you have to pay for lodging. Hostels will run you 20-30 at the minimum! Then you have to account for transportation, unless you walk of course. Food can be cheap but you will probably want to eat out and experience the culture a bit more. Additionally, you will be in a foreign country and are probably going to want to check out cool museums - that will cost you too. However I didn't go to Eastern Europe so I can't exactly say the pricing. Go to Berlin, seriously Berlin is dirt cheap and was my favorite city out of over 15. It was magical! The beer was fantastic and the food delicious.

My most memorable experience was being in Greece during the austerity measures and witnessing the riots. I also enjoyed the MASSIVE music festival called distortion in Copenhagen. The couchsurfing in Berlin was awesome - I stayed with the two coolest girls who showed me many interesting sites. Honestly - everywhere was so much fun. 

I could be wrong but I would budget for 75-100 a day if I were you. There will be costs that you only have to pay once but will be like 50 dollars. Those don't get calculated in as much as they should.

t1_c2gn9df,0,c2gr12u,"&gt;&gt; Were salary costs to grow, businesses would be forced to renegotiate the remaining aspects of their budgets, not merely the employee share. This would drive down business waste.

&gt; Renegotiations would hurt the businesses in question and their providers. Almost doubling the minimum wage would probably force many to go under entirely.

Again, the statistics haven't born that out.  We did not see waves of businesses failing in the wake of previous minimum wage increases.  Probably maybe speculative statements notwithstanding.

What's more, there's nothing looking those admin/sales prices in stone.  Walmart, for instance, regularly makes use of its bulk purchasing power to get better rates.  They negotiate better real estate deals.  And they've been far more competitive than their rivals at Sears.

Meanwhile, Starbucks is known to pay its own baristas upwards of $13 / hr in some states.

http://www.glassdoor.com/Hourly-Pay/Starbucks-Barista-Hourly-Pay-E2202_D_KO10,17.htm

The notion that the business would collapse under the weight of salaries multiple locations *already* pay seems absurd.  We're not going very far outside acceptable range.

&gt; Furthermore, who is to decide that other expenses are ""business waste"" rather than just operational requirements?

I think that job goes to the businesses.

&gt;&gt; On the flip side, newly enriched employees

&gt; if they existed

Again, I'm baffled by the persistent belief that raising the minimum wage will not raise the wages of the people receiving minimum wage.  This dogged insistence that paying someone $15 / hr rather than $8 / hr won't have any impact on their salaries is downright bizarre.

&gt; Increased costs for businesses to pay a wage higher than what the market demands would offset any increases in income for some employees.

That makes no sense.  Assuming a business's operational budget is 30% of costs, doubling salaries should only affect 30% of the cost of the product.  Meanwhile, doubling the salary - for the employee - would result in a 100% increase in salary.  Even if employees did see their expenses rise 30% (and I'm not sure why big ticket items like rent, car payments, utilities would see a corresponding 30% rise either) they'd have 100% more money to pay it with.

&gt; It's just misdistribution of resources.

I think this is where we have a fundamental disagreement.  Paying your employees more money is not a misdirection of resources.  The national average wage is a vital foundation of a country's economic strength and flexibility.  If our citizens can't afford the products that the nation produces - if the majority of employees can't afford an Apple computer or a Ford truck or a Mr Gatti's pizza - then domestic business collapses and we become slaves of the foreign markets.

That's a bad place to be when you're watching markets like Europe (today) or Asia (in the 90s) implode.  Strong economies are ones that are internally self-sustainable.

&gt; Higher real wages are a good thing if they come from increased productivity. If they come from a price floor on labor, the higher wages just apply to fewer people anyway and are harmful to workers who get their hours cut or get fired, and to businesses which have to bear added costs.

That's the problem, though.  Productivity isn't pegged to wages in any meaningful way.  My boss can bill me at whatever he wants.  He's not obligated to tell me what that number is and he's not obligated to pay me more if my services increase business revenue.  When productivity goes up (and it's been rising steadily straight through the recession) employees don't see any commensurate wage increases.

Missionaries have a much more drastic affect in poor, war-ravaged countries. That's why they like Africa so much these days. They can only convince the desperate. 

Historically, Korea was heavily Buddhist and remains so to this day, though Christianity has become very popular as well (I don't know which is more popular). Back in the old days they were heavily Confusianist. Basically only religions (philosophies) that got past China would make it to Korea and Japan (with one notable exception). Muslims never made it into China proper, probably because of the pressure from the Crusades and their cultural decline. The main link with China, however, was the Silk Roads, which had to pass over vast territory between the Muslim lands and China, much of which was sparsely populated, if at all. The deserts and mountains acted as a buffer, and while they were exposed to Islam by traders, those traders were culturally and ethnically so far removed that they wouldn't have had much influence on the Chinese, which had a very solid culture and religious identity at the time of the Muslim conquests.  

As for Japan, they are primarily *Shinto*. They were exposed to Christianity by I think early Dutch traders, but they were subsequently cut off from Europe after that by a self-imposed isolation policy, so the small community of Christians eventually changed the religion over time, meanwhile European Christianity changes in other ways. I don't think Korea was ever exposed to that kind of Christianity. I think missionaries started coming over here in the 1800's, though I'm sure the bulk of them came after the war.

And yet people are displaced all over the world all the time. Otherwise how do you think counties change over history? I wont get into a discussion whether Israel deliberately displaced Arabs in 48 or whether they left out of their own will as they were told by their own leaders. The truth is somewhere in the middle and there is no 100% proof either way.

If you want to treat '48 as some magical number that every one should return to, then why not go to the 1900 and the ottoman empire? Why not go to 100BCE and before Jews were kicked out?

It doesn't matter anymore what happened in '48, and should have no baring on today. Even if you say that Israel was a devil in '48 doesn't give anyone the right to throw out and displace the millions of Jews who now live in Israel and call it their home. It is no less evil (or even more so) then what you claim happened in '48.

Also how will you deal will a German that married a Pole, their kid married a someone who is half Italian half Yemenite, their child married someone who is a quarter American, a quarter Lybian, a quarter Palestinian (you know one of the Jews who were here before magic '48 came around and even before), and a quarter Russian?
This is not a theoretical question.

&gt; The question about the Zionists living in Israel: If your from Europe go to Europe, if your from Yemen, Iran, or Egypt then you must go back.

And who whill vouch for them not getting butchered?? There is a good reason that once Israel was created Jews, Bah√°'√≠, Sudannese (sp?), Arab Gays, etc... have run to Israel so they can be treated as human beings.

&gt; Occupation is immoral and illegal.

More so then sending people to being bullied, being subject to pogroms and maybe even butchered?
What you are suggesting is no more immoral or illegal under the UN and international law (regarding refugees, revoking citizenship and more).

&gt; One more thing, the Palestinians who lost everything will have to go back and rebuild and start over, and its only fair that the Zionists should go back to their place of Origin and start over.

Maybe we should go to 1870's? See where everyone was back then? Maybe we should go back to the Ottoman rule and bring back everyone that the British threw out? And you think these Palestinians were here from the beginning of time? Many came during the Ottoman Rule, maybe we should see where they came from and throw them back as well! What makes '48 so magical?

&gt; There are Jews that Stand by the Muslims and argue that the Zionist state of Israel is 100 percent wrong, and they can prove that they lived in Palestine before the land thefts of Zionism started.

And there are Muslims that stand up against and argue that the state of Israel has a right to exist. And I can prove that Jews lived in Israel before this whole 'Muslim' thing even started.

&gt; and those who came under the banner of Zionism have tried to destroy all former bonds between the two

Except the Muslims that have treated Jews with strong anti antisemitism almost since their rise? (Like is quite plainly stated in the Qur'an?)

&gt; but the one's who have a longer attention span than just what happened in 1948 can tell you that the Jews in Palestine were only 3% of the population before the Zionist Machinations begun.

And if you read historical documents from the early 1800's from the narratives of historians who passed through this area you would see that it was mostly barren and the influx of Arabs/Muslims happened only towards the end of the 1800's.

Basically, atheists in England live in a somewhat uneasy peace with their religious neighbors.  Here in America, its a war; sometimes a cold war, sometimes a guerrilla war, and occasionally a very open conflict.  It is somewhat ironic that by allowing religious freedom, America was opened up to discrimination against the non-religious.  Atheists are a small, if growing, minority of Americans, and many of us live around people who want one of two things for us.  Either they want to save us from hell at any cost, and thus shove their religion at us any chance they get with no regard for what we think, or they want us to die quickly and stop corrupting ""their"" country/world.  

In America, even the relative moderates talk about the ""culture of death"" promoted by rejection of the Abrahamic God, Jesus, and the Bible.  After the thousandth time you're told ""I'll pray for you"" or ""I pity you"" or any of the various myths about atheism, it starts to annoy you.  I personally try to be tolerant of others' beliefs, as long as they confine those beliefs to purely spiritual matters and don't push me to convert.  They can't be evaluated scientifically, so as long as I'm left to believe what I want to believe, I return the favor.  But all too often here, people do push their beliefs on you, shouting them from street corners and shoving pamphlets into your hands.  And they also use their beliefs to deny reality, as with creationism, and I can't abide ignorance and/or lies.

[Seriously. Check the Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_in_the_Middle_Ages#Early_Middle_Ages_.28AD_476.E2.80.931000.29)

Look. I'ma lay this out for you. Up until the late Enlightenment people did science because they wanted to learn about and become closer to god. 

There are reasons why things happened the way they happened. When Rome withdrew to Byzantium the Western Roman Empire was in a period of extreme cultural upset, with Pagans, Catholic Christians, Arian Christians, and others contending for control of the remnants of the Empire and it's domains. Huge influxes of Goths were coming in from the east. Not necessarily burning everything in their path, but altering the social and religious landscape around them. 

This lead to the loss of economic trade with the Mediterranean. The Med was always the center of Roman learning and culture. ""Europe"", meaning Iberia, Germania, Gaul, and Britannia, were always cultural backwaters inhabited by scarce Romans and hordes of Barbarians with little in the way of written language or scholastic inquiry. 

So you have a backwater, isolated from trade with the Mediterranean and the East, into which a small number of Christians are moving to attempt to convert, culturally and religiously, huge numbers of pagans. They're doing this as the logistical and legal resources of the Empire disappear around them, as much as anything because without the Roman Empire centered in Italy there is no incentive for Mediterranean trade routes to extend much past Italy. Europa was too poor to have trade ties with the south and east. 

Arabia, Annatolia, Judea, Egypt, and points east had many, many advantages. The forms of Greek in which many ancient texts were written was still widely known. Unlike the Northwest, where there were few, if any, urban centers, the Med had dozens of large cities situated on important trade routes. Traveling in Dar al-Islam was easier than traveling in Christendom. Exchange of ideas was easier not because the Christians of the 5th-10th century were a bunch of knowledge fearing reactionaries, but because they didn't move around very much. 

Shit, Galileo? Galileo lived a thousand years after the middle ages, well into the Renaissance, at the end of the 1500's. And he was a devout Christian arguing for support of Heliocentrism based on the Augustinian tradition of scriptural interpretation. You know Augustinian? Black dude, lived in North Africa, father of the church? 

The order handed down to him was not ""Never speak of this"", but ""You can discuss the hypotheses but you may not claim that it is true. Surprise surprise! The Church didn't ban the idea. It made a politically and religiously motivated decree that allowed Galileo to discuss and pursue his ideas and allowed the Church to fulfill it's own political and ideological needs. 

When Galileo really got in trouble it was not simply ""Dur science BURN BURN BURN!"" Galileo had been asked, by the Pope no less, to write a book laying out the arguments for Geocentrism and Heliocentrism, without favouring one or the other, and to include the Popes own views. This is the Pope, the highest authority in Christianity, saying ""I respect your views as equal to my own and worthy of serious discussion and consideration. please put my views on equal footing with your own in this book.""

Seriously. Fucking think about that for a second. The Pope respected Galileo's views enough to request he write a fucking book about them, setting them right next to The Pope's own views. 

When Galileo actually wrote the book he made the Pope sound like a fool and strongly argued in favor of Heliocentrism. To his friend the Pope this looked like a double betrayal. First, making the Pope look a fool during a time when he was in an extremely dangerous and delicate position, and secondly doing so while flying in the face of the Pope's own request that the book be written with both arguments laid out. 

Keep in mind that Heliocentrism was not an obvious truth. Geocentrism persisted as a model of the solar system for centuries not because people are stupid, but because that model, in the absence of a theory of gravitation, powerful telescopes, and extremely precise astronomical measurements, fits all available evidence and data. 

Again, let me restate that. If you don't clearly understand that all objects attract one another, and if you can only view the stars with your naked eye, Geocentrism fits the observable data. And the idea was not blindly accepted. As new data became available the Geocentric model was elaborated on to account for it. This was very much in the manner of Physicists in the late 19th century trying to come up with a model for the Atom. They knew it was there, they had an idea of what it did, but they weren't sure why, or exactly how, and so based their models on the best evidence. 

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Far from being dogmatically opposed to the idea of Heliocentrism, the Pope was willing to allow the idea to be discussed openly so long as the Pope was not exposed to undue danger by supporting a radical and extremely controversial idea that not only had religious implications among some strains of Christianity but also threw two thousand years of careful, scientific observation out the window. It sounded crazy to a lot of people, like if someone suddenly came up and said ""Massive objects deform space and time. As objects approach the speed of light they become more Energetic. Energy equals Mass time the square of the Speed of Light.""

It's correct, to the limits of available data. But that's not immediately obvious. Just as Relativity through out the well established and mathematically supported Newtonian physics so Heliocentrism threw out the well established and mathematically supported Geocentric model.

In reality, I doubt this would happen. I suppose the most obvious one would be the worlds military research branches would immediately begin fashioning new super-weapons based on anti-matter, assuming we can cheaply create more as needed.

I expect NASA and ESA would begin exploratory flights, around our solar system, maybe to the nearest star but it would be slow going.

Warp technology would be sold down to the mega-corporations who would then fashion a fleet of craft to work inside the solar system, flying to various moons and asteroids to claim mining rights in order to sell materials and minerals acquired from these places.

So let me break this down. 

1.) The church, through the Pope himself, encouraged Galileo to publish and discuss his hypothesis so long as he positioned it as a hypothesis, one of many plausible explanations for an observed phenomena. 

2.) Galileo, probably without any malice, managed to grievously offend the Pope by portraying him as foolish in the resulting book. 

3.) Having offended the Pope Galileo lost his protection. This created an opportunity for Galileo's enemies and detractors an opportunity to silence him.

4.) For largely political reasons Galileo was tried for Heresy. Having made an enemy of the Pope, who had supported him in discussing his ideas, having offended both scientists and religious parties with his radical new ideas, and having given his enemies the perfect opportunity to dispose of him, he was sentenced to house arrest and his publications were suppressed.

This is not simple. This is not easy. This is not at all like what you read in the History books. History does not and cannot conform to the ideological battles of the present. And in laying the conflicts of the present over the affairs of the past you debase yourself and cheapen your own beliefs. 

PS - Aquaducts are pretty cool. Christendom lost the technology. Then they invented shit like Flying Buttresses, in the 10th century, before the Crusades and during the height of the ""Dark Ages"". 

[Medieval Technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_technology#Agriculture)

Look at this. A lot of it seems obvious to us... Because we've been living with it for a thousand years. But shit like the heavy plow and the horse collar were revolutionary. They totally changed the landscape of Europe, allowing for higher population density and better food security. 

To the rest of you: 

This attitude, full of righteousness, confident in the Justice of it's position, and lacking an adequate background and understanding of the facts and complexities of the case, is exactly the kind of thing that makes religion so dangerous. 

Religion is not the belief in gods and demons. It is the adherence to a culturally significant ideology and belief system that defines the nature of the world. 

Secular Humanism, Progressivism, and other scientifically aligned belief systems strive for a world view in which rational inquiry is paramount, beliefs are second to evidence, and reality is accepted as being governed by fixed rules which can be revealed and understood through observation and experiment. Key to this system of beliefs is the ability to set aside old ideas in light of new evidence. 

The ""Dark Ages"" and the bugbear of a deeply technophobic Catholic Church that actively sought to supress scientific progress are just the sort of ideas that need to be set aside. These concepts arose out of the deeply flawed and limited historical investigations of the 19th and 20th century. We have much better evidence now. We can now say with confidence that the situation was not simple.

The Christian Church of the 4th through 16th centuries was made up of an enormous area covering most of Europe. It included millions of people, dozens of competing ideologies, numerous warring nations, vast cultural and religious syncretism, cultural exchange with Vikings, Rus, Goths, Huns, Muslims, Byzantines, Mongols, and others. What the Church did in Italy in 900ad is vastly different from what was done in central Gaul (Carolingian Renaissance), Ireland (monks preserving ancient texts), North Africa (Yes, there were Christians in Africa) and China (Yes, there were Christians in China. Nestorians, I believe.) 

Reducing this vast cultural diaspora, covering three continents, spanning a thousand years, encompassing tens or hundreds of millions of lives, to a mere statement ""Christianity is incompatible with science."" is foolish, shortsighted, dogmatic, and, in light of the available evidence, absolutely false. 

We strive to a better understanding of the world. We dismiss religion because we believe that evidence does not support religious claims. Religion is not an enemy.

As for why they didn't modernize and develop rifles, one theory is that the Eastern style of fighting just didn't benefit all that much from the addition of firearms.  As opposed to the Western style with emphasis on infantry exchanges, the typical Eastern style mainly emphasize cavalry maneuvers to dictate battles.  Give a rifle to an infantry footman and he can suddenly dominate his immediate battlefield, but give a rifle to a horse archer and he's still basically a horse archer with a slightly longer range.

You have to also remember that early firearms were usually worse in terms of accuracy and firing-rate than the bow &amp; arrow.  The decline of the bow and arrow seemed to be more due to the fact that no one bothered to practice with them anymore rather than their lack of combat utility.  The English themselves used their long bows well into the 16th Century.

t1_c2glovm,0,c2grl2f,"I don't think it has much to do with ""supporting industry"" or even ""craftsmanship"". There was no supporting industry. There were no quarries churning out the best stone, there were no master craftsmen buying the best stone to turn into tools, there were no middlemen arranging deals. There was no supporting industry. This was basically the tool users themselves picking up stone during their wanderings, and chipping it into shape for whatever intended use.

We are talking about a period almost two million years ago, when humans were much, much more primitive. These were not modern humans, these were ancestral species with brains much smaller than ours. When we use the word ""industry"" in reference to these hominids, such as when talking about ""Oldowan Industry"" or ""Acheulian Industry"", we don't actually mean ""industry"" in its modern sense at all. What we mean is ancient hominids picking up and shaping stones, as you can train chimps to do as well. One reason why we call it ""industry"" is to separate it from culture or even species. So ""Oldowan Industry"" could have been conducted by different cultures spread across the world, even by half a dozen different species of hominids. Not all of them human either.

There is no huge difference in craftsmanship between Oldowan and Acheulian industries, The biggest difference is bifacial technology. Someone got the idea that if you are chipping away at a stone block to make an edge, you will get a better and sharper and more symmetrical edge if you chip from both sides of the stone, not just a single side. So in that sense, it's like making an Oldovan scraper tool, then simply turning it around in your hand and working the other face exactly like the previous one.

The most popular and enduring result of this technology was the [Acheulian Hand Axe](http://lithiccastinglab.com/gallery-pages/handaxesovaltripsm.jpg) - the single tool that remained in use unchanged for the longest time ever by humans. Apparently, we continued to use it for over a million years without improving it any further.

The question of why *H. erectus* ""left part of his toolkit behind"" is more complex, and has no easy answers.

First, despite the title, we don't know for a fact that they did ""leave it behind"". This new dating pushes back the Acheulian industry to 1.76 million years. But there is evidence that *H. erectus* may have already left Africa even earlier. Stone tools dating back 1.9 million years have been found at [Rawat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riwat) in [Pakistan](http://www.athenapub.com/13sunda.htm). There are 1.83 million year old tools [from Malaysia](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j4NR2q7FWeVMwDjWVzYcF_R4qXEg), 1.8 million year old tools [from Israel](http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/anthro/programs/csho/Content/Facultycvandinfo/Anton/ARA04scaccs.pdf). Hell, even [Dmanisi man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_georgicus) could be over 1.8 million years old.

All these dates are in flux, as most dates are. It's always possible they'll be revised up or down a bit. But as they stand, the short answer to ""why did they leave part of their toolkit behind in Africa?"" is  **that they didn't, they left before Acheulian technology had been invented**.

Second, even if Acheulian tools were around when some hominids left Africa later, that doesn't mean they were in possession of those particular hominids who left Africa.

The fact is that this whole period is very hazy, and probably Africa of the time was inhabited by many different cultures and many different species, and it's wrong to think of them as some monolithic *H. erectus* who only took some of his tools along when he left Africa.

The first stone tools humans made belong to the Oldowan industry, going back 2.6 million years. There was a time when anthropologists thought that tool making must be a very human thing, and so they forced all data to fit the idea that somehow it must have been *H. habilis* who started that industry. But most people don't believe that anymore. There were probably a whole range of hominids, including *Australopithecus* and *Paranthropus* as well as early *Homo* living in Africa at the time, and *all of them* were making Oldowan tools.

While many anthropologists believe that the Acheulian industry marks some turning point in the human brain in terms of evolution, you have to understand that just because the brain is capable of something doesn't mean the critter will do it. Not all humans build rockets today, and not all *H. erectus* made Acheulian tools. Heck, there was *H. erectus* in Asia making Oldowan tools as late as half a million years ago. This, over a million years after *H. erectus* across most of the world had switched to Acheulian industry, and in fact some hominids had even taken a step further. This was **after** *H. rhodesiensis* in Africa and *H. heidelbergensis* in Europe and Asia already improved greatly on Acheulian technology and were leading on to the final stretch towards modern humans. And yet, here were these *H. erectus* using 2.6+ million year old stone technology.

This is why it's no surprise that *H. erectus* ""left some of his tools behind in Africa"". He may have left before the tools were invented, or he may have belonged to one of the zillions of groups of *H. erectus* that didn't have the tools at the time (and some continued to not have them for the next million years).",2,True,1314891474,,2,,False,xenofon,0,,1427546194,t1_c2grl2f,0,t3_k0jlm,science,t5_mouw,False

Hanson looks at why Western Europe was the first to invent Guns, and was consistently the first to improve the design of guns and the tactics for using them.

If I could extend Diamond's arguments a little more, some have argued that Western culture is an [r-type species](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-species), like fireweed, which always needs fresh resources to colonize.

It's not.  I'm assuming that the US population, on average, is not vastly stupider or more intelligent than any other in the world - and European church membership has plummeted in the past decade or two.  Unfortunately, education is hard, and takes a while to kick in.

And to a certain degree, even very bright people tend to take certain scientific concepts on faith - the difference is that they tend to understand that, given enough effort, they could attempt to prove or disprove a given assertion.  Religion = proprietary, science = open source, and all that.

There is proof that Palestinians lived there before the European Zionist Movement came to Palestine. In fact its so well documented that I was surprised to read your statement. Whether you want to start before or after the British Mandate of **Palestine** doesn't matter Palestinians have always been there. You say that they were told to leave by their leaders, but in reality they were being forced to leave by the Zionist military that had been formed during the British Mandate. The Zionists committed many atrocities against the Palestinians and as any group of civilians would do they first tried to fight back but were outmaneuvered and out gunned. 

To show you the difference between the Palestinian forces and the Zionist force's I will use the example of Palestinian farmers who took their savings to buy guns but could not afford bullets, whereas the Zionists received British training and weaponry.


&gt;""And who whill vouch for them not getting butchered?? There is a good reason that once Israel was created Jews, Bah√°'√≠, Sudannese (sp?), Arab Gays, etc... have run to Israel so they can be treated as human beings.More so then sending people to being bullied, being subject to pogroms and maybe even butchered? What you are suggesting is no more immoral or illegal under the UN and international law (regarding refugees, revoking citizenship and more).""

This argument will not work, it is wrong to think that the Jews are going to be bullied where ever they go, but if this is a issue of contention among all Jews than we can get assurance's from all places of origin. 

The idea of being persecuted is what drives the Zionist mind set and it is why they are so brutal to the Palestinians. 

&gt; ""And if you read historical documents from the early 1800's from the narratives of historians who passed through this area you would see that it was mostly barren and the influx of Arabs/Muslims happened only towards the end of the 1800's.""

The History you speak of is fraudulent and was inspired by the idea that selling ""a land without a people, to a people without a land"" would make Jews more likely to follow the ideals of Zionism. 

If you are a fool to think that one inch of that land was not inhabited that is your mistake to make, but know this that land has been holy to Christians, Muslims and Jews, and not one of those groups would leave willingly. **In fact the the dome of the rock was used as a church and a mosque since 619 and Aqsa Mosque has been there since 705.**

**The truth is that Israel stole the land and ethnically cleansed over 500 villages, and destroyed any evidence possible, and renamed all roads and cities.**

1948 is important because that is when Israel destroyed everything the Palestinians knew, and it is Remembered by the Palestinians as the NAKBA or Catastrophe.

My favorite vacation(s) were the two trips my wife and I took to Europe to visit friends living there. We've been for about a month combined to Southwestern Germany, Paris, and Amsterdam. It was a great experience, and although we did know enough German and French to get around, we are certainly USA-bred and did not receive any negative treatment that we are aware of because of it.

I am of Siberian origins who moved to Ottawa and walked 90-120+ minutes a day during winter, including in the middle of blizzards, hate the buses during this season because of all the sweaty people in smelly jackets. 

To be honest, winters here aint as tragic as people make them seem, i have been through much worse.

First of all, you need a hat, i wear a [Russian bomber hat](http://www.e4hats.com/_e/gdept/52/Trooper_Winter_Hats.htm), keeps your head and ears warm from any wind chill. I can hear the HAHA RUSSIAN STEREOTYPE NO NUMBER FOR JAKUCHA, **SHUT UP**, we beat hitler and napoleon during winter, we know cold survival like nobody else, so wear our fucking hats. 

Second: if you plan to walk a lot during middle of a windy winter, your nose will be runny and frozen, so i wear a [ski mask](http://www.e4hats.com/search.aspx?si=&amp;sp=ski+mask), which is made exactly for this purpose, just remember to take it off before getting into class or doing a bank run, terrorism and bla bla bla.

If its REALLY windy or it also snows like a motherfucker and you cant see shit, get some good quality goggles that will not fog, if they do, clean them with tooth paste and leave it over night.

Outer wear: Thick leather jacket, why ?, ask any biker what works best for wind. A water resistant parka might also do, mine also had a hoodie, not that i really used it.

2nd layer: a normal hoodie, the hood is especially useful in keeping your hat on your head when its very windy and keeps the back of your neck warm.

A good wool scarf, and dont use a lame european chic stylish wrap, wrap it like you are trying to hang yourself.

I usually just wear a t-shirt under the hoodie, its nice to have layers because then i can just take my jacket off inside a building and walk around in hoodie and t-shirt.

For pants, best of all is getting some winter leggings to keep you warm, and then wearing thick jeans or track pants ([adidas three stripe](http://www.blog37.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/FM91t1.jpg) here, guilty).

For your feet, the first and best defence is thick wool socks, afterwards it really depends on what your environment will be like, if its slushy and wet, i wear water/oil proof construction boots.

If its windy outside then it probably means everything will be an ice skating rink, so i wear my [hi-tops](http://images.asos.com/inv/s/72/728/542700/black/image1xl.jpg), why sneakers ?, because i need the balance. Also, when possible, walk in the soft snow as opposed to the packed snow or ice roads, it takes longer but its been 3 years since i last slipped and fell when walking.

Winters here are really quite warm, i dont see why you all complain so much.

EDIT: Ah, gloves, yes. Either mittens or thin leather gloves. Thick gloves are pointless because you have little dexterity with your fingers, and more of a hassle when taking them off and on. If you need to use your hands, wear leather gloves and suck it up.

Irrelevant. This was in response to a claim made about the cost of Maters degrees, and it communicated the point. If you want to make the argument that the debt load of students obtaining masters degrees is handily offset by earnings, creating a margin that beats European grads, then we will need some data. Though even then, that does not address the issue of access. The risk associated with debt creates a strong deterrent that could act to prevent otherwise eligible and capable students from enrolling.

I've read my fill of Derchowitz, &amp; Benny Morris even though I staunchly disagree with their perspective on the issue.  Defining what anti-Semitism is not is much more feasible than defining what it is.  There will always be a level of subjectivity due to the very personal nature of racism, &amp; due to the somewhat vague understanding of modern Judaism.  With many defining themselves as Jews (even if they are atheists) the line between race &amp; religion becomes blurred.  There are Arab Jews, European Jews, Ethiopian Jews, all different races with one religion, &amp; in their case anti-Semitism would be discrimination against their religious identity.  For many Ashkenazi &amp; other types of Jews who no longer believe or practice the basic tenants of the Jewish religion, anti-Semitism would be an affront to their cultural identity.  Despite the somewhat vague nature of its definition, I cannot see criticism of a State's policies as anti-Semitism.  Saudi Arabia claims to be a Muslim state, but criticising their policies in not Islamaphobic (regardless of how oppressive &amp; ass-backwards most of their policies are).    

Here is [Noam Chomsky's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky's_political_views#Views_on_anti-Semitism) take on anti-Semitism, I tend to agree with it:

&gt;I grew up with anti-Semitism in the United States. We were the only Jewish family in a mostly Irish- and German-Catholic neighborhood, which was very anti-Semitic and pretty pro-Nazi. For a young boy in the streets, you got to know what that meant. When my father was first able to get a secondhand car in the late 30s, we drove to the local mountains and passed hotels that said ""restricted"" meaning ""no Jews"". That was just part of life. When I got to Harvard in the 1950s, the anti-Semitism was so thick you could cut it with a knife. In fact, one of the reasons MIT is a great university is that people like Norbert Wiener couldn't get jobs at Harvard-it was too anti-Semitic-so they came to the engineering school down the street. That was anti-Semitism. Now, it's a very marginal issue. There is still racism, but its anti-Arab racism which is extreme. Distinguished Harvard professors write that Palestinians are people who bleed and breed their misery in order to drive the Jews into the sea, and that's considered acceptable. If some distinguished Harvard professor were to write that Jews are people who bleed and breed and advertise their misery in order to drive Palestinians into the desert, the cry of outrage would be enormous. When Jewish intellectuals who are regarded as humanist leaders say that Israel ought to settle the underpopulated Galilee-meaning too many Arabs, not enough Jews-that's considered wonderful. Violent anti-Arab racism is so prevalent that we don't even notice it. That's what we should be worried about. It's in the cinema, advertising, everywhere. On the other hand, anti-Semitism is there, but very marginal.

Because some want to study at our fantastic top-tier Universities. But that alone does not mean that, on a whole, we have a superior system. Again, consider the example of NY Public schools.

As someone with Reiki Master- and ""I see dead people"" friends, I discuss these things mostly to discover why people believe these particular explanations. Astrology is interesting. If you believe you're intense and jealous because you're a Scorpio than basically it's not your fault you're that way. It's part of your nature and the stars made you this way. Astrology usually also lists some good characteristics. So, you have this handy little manual that tells you who you are and why. 

I can understand why your friends like astrology. Its a relatively non-religious way of finding answers. It's easy to do yourself and delivered to your iPhone's daily-horoscoop-app in 2 short lines. Especially if they work in 'soft' areas such as philosophy and humanities it's nice to have something you can turn to when you get stuck in life. Especially in the social sciences, where you have no direct results and the idea of ""facts"" are highly disputed, things get a little grey. 

I remember one experiment where personal zodiac descriptions where handed out to a group. Everyone raised their hands when asked if the description was accurate. They were all given the exact same text.
I met a guy who said he knew my sign. Guessed incorrectly 4 times. When I read the description for Pisces, it does feel like it's describing me.

These are the upstream suppliers to companies like SpectraWatt, the subject of the article.

And then what about the customer base for companies like SpectraWatt?

[Europe's share of PV product installations reached 79% in 2010](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/k1hf4/europes_share_of_pv_product/)

So notice the primary suppliers and customers are not even in the US so as a matter of supply chain logistics, you have to fly to Asia for everything and as a matter of sales logistics, you have to fly to Europe for everything, just to survive.  Your upstream and downstream supply chains are outside of your immediate geography.

The mostly logical start-up decision would have been to co-locate with suppliers in Asia or co-locate with customers in Europe.  The US is the last place to locate.  As ""logical"" as setting up in South America or Africa, which would be obviously ""not so much"".

You can bitch and complain about this.  You can beat your chest ineffectively and yell ""USA! USA! USA!"" but that all changes NOTHING.  The simple facts of reality are thus: America has *already* fallen way behind in technology related to Green Energy - this is evidence.  

You make a reality-based choice or you make a fantasy/faith-based choice.  Which one do you really think will work out better?  

I *know* in Washington DC there really are folks who completely believe the latter does - they think if you can will reality to be what you want it really will become reality.  In another age, these folks were simply and quickly locked up in sanitariums and asylums but today they run the US government and Wall Street.

I *know* there are also ""economists"" who claim you don't need manufacturing. They are 100% wrong because this is what happens when you don't manufacture.  If you don't play the game, you can't win at it.

**Manufacturing is the only economic activity that has the means, motive and opportunity to commit technological innovation.**

So, yes, the US must manufacture but the ways that has been pursued (or more accurately, randomly allowed to go fallow), will never work because there are deep structural reasons why this situation of supply and demand disintermediating the entire US has occurred.

They all leave and come to America (or Europe, or Australia, etc.). Israel is actually one of the more dangerous places in the world to be a Jew - that's why Jewish Israelis don't want to have babies there anymore.

Sub-Saharan Africa, unlike Europe and the rest of Eurasia, was disconnected from Mesopotamia and unable to receive the booster-crops, domesticated animals, and spreading technology that facilitated the development of civilizations. This separation via the Sahara not only prevented them from encountering new and possibly useful technology, but it also meant that Africans never worried about the need for firearms or advanced weapons because they never encountered people who were developing those. Despite this, Sub-Saharan Africans independently developed iron-smelting and proceeded from the stone age directly to the iron age -- so, I'm not too sure about the ""banging rocks together"" sentiment.

&gt;I don't need some Jew from the year 2001 to write some bullshit PC book that doesn't take into account 90% of black African history to tell me whats what

This is really funny considering earlier you were chiding someone for not accepting the facts of something because it didn't support their side. The book doesn't solely discuss Africans, but examples around the rest of the world -- including Mesoamericans that developed advanced astronomy and mathematics, but not the wheel, and Australian Aboriginals who, despite not leaving the stone age, showed signs of brilliance but happened to be limited by the horrid climate of Australia.

I'm just starting to think that you are simply viewing the end-results (blacks cause more crime, Africans were easily defeated by Europeans), ignoring the causes, and instead drawing up conclusions that support your ""White Man's Burden"" ideals while ignoring the well-established causes behind them.

Now as far as the velocity of a swallow goes...here are my thought:

In order to maintain airspeed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings forty-three times every second, right?
Actually, wrong. By comparing the European Swallow with bird species of similar body mass, we can estimate that the swallow beats its wings 18 times a second with an amplitude of 18 cm:

Species	Body mass	Frequency	Amplitude
Zebra Finch	13 g	27 Hz	11 cm
European Swallow	20 g	‚âà 18 Hz?	‚âà 18 cm?
Downy Woodpecker	27 g	14 Hz	29 cm
Budgerigar	34 g	14 Hz	15 cm
Note that even the tiny Zebra Finch flaps its wings no more than 27 times a second while cruising.

If we ignore body mass and look only at bird species with a similar wingspan, we can estimate an average frequency of 14 beats per second and an amplitude of 23 cm:

Species	Wingspan	Frequency	Amplitude
Budgerigar	27 cm	14 Hz	15 cm
European Swallow	‚âà 28‚Äì30 cm	‚âà 14 Hz?	‚âà 23 cm?
Downy Woodpecker	31 cm	14 Hz	29 cm
European Starling	35 cm	14 Hz	26 cm
By averaging all 6 values, we can estimate that an average European Swallow flies at cruising speed with a frequency of roughly 15 beats per second, and an amplitude of roughly 22 cm.

Skip a bit, Brother
Last month‚Äôs article on The Strouhal Number in Cruising Flight showed how simplified flight waveforms that graph amplitude versus wavelength can be useful for visualizing the Strouhal ratio (fA/U), a dimensionless parameter that tends to fall in the range of 0.2‚Äì0.4 during efficient cruising flight.

For a European Swallow flying with our estimated wingbeat amplitude of 24 cm, the predicted pattern of cruising flight ranges from a Strouhal number (St) of 0.2:

 	
... to a less efficient 0.4:

 	
If the first diagram (St = 0.2) is accurate, then the cruising speed of the European Swallow would be roughly 16 meters per second (15 beats per second * 1.1 meters per beat). If the second diagram (St = 0.4) is accurate, then the cruising speed of the European Swallow would be closer to 8 meters per second (15 beats per second * 0.55 meters per beat).

If we settle on an intermediate Strouhal value of 0.3:

 	
We can estimate the airspeed of the European Swallow to be roughly 11 meters per second (15 beats per second * 0.73 meters per beat).

I don't know that much about Lind, but I don't know Bowman either.  It's not like I'm saying that Bowman rules and Lind sucks.  I simply pointed out that Lind was being disingenuous.  That's wrong on both sides.  Of course, Lind did strike first.  However, I don't know that much about either party.  

&gt;Even though Bowman makes the claim that the quote is taken out of context, nothing in the preceding paragraphs really negates what Mises did in fact say.

You don't even need to read the preceding paragraphs!  Just read the complete paragraph that was paraphrased:

&gt;It cannot be denied that Fascism and similar movements aiming at the establishment of dictatorships are full of the best intentions and that their intervention has, for the moment, saved European civilization. The merit that Fascism has thereby won for itself will live on eternally in history.

vs.

&gt;It cannot be denied that Fascism and similar movements aiming at the establishment of dictatorships are full of the best intentions and that their intervention has, for the moment, saved European civilization. The merit that Fascism has thereby won for itself will live on eternally in history. But though its policy has brought salvation for the moment, it is not of the kind which could promise continued success. Fascism was an emergency makeshift. To view it as something more would be a fatal error.

Is a pretty big difference.  One quote says that Fascism has merit.  The other quote says that fascism only had merit as temporary crisis response.  Those are two completely different arguments.

&gt;What brought Chil's economy to the brink of collapse wasn't Allende's economic policies, but a combination of Nixon's undercutting of anything Chile tried to do and the fact that the entire world was experiencing and economic meltdown during that time. In fact, you might recall that Nixon himself had instituted wage and price controls during this same period - while noting that Bowman conveniently left this embarrassing fact out.

Except that Allende's policies did have a lot of effects that weren't seen elsewhere.  There was triple digit inflation for one.  I'm not saying that it was all Allende's fault as previous administrations had pushed Chile down a similar road.  The fact that other recessions occurred in other places too is not an ""embarrassing fact.""  There have been some pretty bad global recessions since then, and Chile has not repeated that situation.  

&gt;This one passage is about as close to revising history as it gets because both Friedman and Hayek were well understood to have continuously counseled Nixon to out Allende.

And that is completely different from saying that, ""we need a violent autocratic regime so that we can torture people.""  Once again, views on economics are being associated with support for autocracy.  Also, you are giving no sources to anything helpful to your argument.  You are simply making statements that don't seem to be backed up in the way that you describe.

&gt;So, we're not excusing Pinochet but we are clearly stating that a man who murdered thousands of his own people for holding different political views (remember, these were peaceful protestors and newspaper editors, not terrorists) but Bowman pretty much embraces Pinochet by using a Harry Truman quote, ‚ÄúHe may be a bastard, but he‚Äôs our bastard.‚Äù 

That is your own inference.  In no way was Bowman saying anything that excused Allende.  He was simply pointing to the fact that Hayek believed Pinochet to be the lesser of two evils.  And Friedman spoke out against the lack of true freedom in Chile, WHILE IN CHILE!  Friedman refused two honorary degrees from Chilean state universities due to the fact that he was against the regime's lack of respect for freedom. OUr own government has worked with dictators that have slaughtered MILLIONS. It's a matter of bringing scale to the discussion, not vindicating a mass murderer.

&gt;No one on the left or what was then considered to be the center in the US (or the rest of the world) was supporting installing right-wing autocracy - just the hard right wing.

Hard right wing is a nonsensical string of words, fyi.  Once again, I don't believe that Hayek or Friedman wanted to install a ""hard right wing autocracy"" either.  They are simply economists who wanted to see economic changes made that would help people.  Everything you are writing is simply an emotional attack.  We all know that Friedman and Hayek HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH, AND IN NO WAY SUPPORTED, Pinochet's autocratic policies.  This is all an attempt to smear two thinkers.  Show me some actual support for Pinochet's crimes, or stop pretending that such support existed.

&gt;Think about this, the United States violently overthrew Allende (a democratically elected leader) 

Sorta.  He was never popular, and never even came close to a majority.  He even used violent police tactics against protesters too.

&gt;and then installed a jackbooted thug which we continued to prop up economically throughout his term

I disagree with this.  The peg to the US dollar did more to hurt than to help the Chilean economy.  I'm not seeing where this US economic support came from.

&gt;Bowman defends this as a something that libertarians agree with?

Wrong again.  He was defending two economic thinkers for making statements about economics and offering economic advice.  Once again, you jump to some ridiculous conclusion FROM NOTHING.

&gt;I ask you, honestly, do you believe that the United Stated should be involved in removing a democratically elected leader half way around the world and installing a dictator?

Nope.  However, I'm pretty sure that Pinochet's coup would have occurred without any US support. It seemed like things were moving that way pretty quickly on the ground considering the level of economic dislocation.  Change was going to happen, and  violent revolution was probably unavoidable.  Remember, it was collectivism that lead to this point and it was markets that took Chile away from dictatorship.  

&gt;This is what we did with the Shah of Iran and we are still experiencing the blowback from that one, as we do with South America today.

Friedman spoke out against the Shah too.  

&gt;I lived through this period of history, Bowman kind of shows exactly how far he has to go to smear Lind in the passages I quoted and there is more I could have gone into but didn't.

What smear?  Lind was the one smearing economists as supporters of autocracy, and even all libertarians by association.  You haven't pointed out one smear of Lind.  All you have done is pointed out disagreements that you have with Bowman. Show me where he smears lind.  He doesn't even say anything about Lind or his career outside of a couple of lines here and there.  And yes, economic nationalism is nationalism.  Call a spade a spade.

After the shootings and the strange men following my girlfriend around and the being stuck without air conditioning for two or three weeks in the middle of a Texas summer, I was stuck with a roach motel that was charging double what was in the contract (convenient payment errors through their online vendor), with a $300 parking ticket, and with a rather nutty now-ex whose brother was threatening to kick my ass because she got high and decided that I was an assassin because I'm European and wouldn't pee in front of her (as I didn't have to pee, not because I'm European). 

So I trashed the place. I trashed it in ways that they still have to be cleaning up. I duct taped cheese and meat to the underside of things and turned off the air conditioning. I filled the bathtub with condiments and then with water. I mutilated the walls, turned the perishable-stocked fridge and freezer off, barricaded the door in such a way that it wouldn't open after I shut it and the windows in such a way that breaking them would be the only way into the flat. Then I left in the middle of the night and walked out on the bulk of my lease.

Here is what I said:  

&gt;Regarding the article: whatever it ignores or doesn't ignore is certainly something you can discuss and critique. That you disagree with it, doesn't make it ""an anti-Semetic article."" You don't see the difference between critiquing an article and labeling it racist because it doesn't fit your narrative?

&gt;Regarding Sailer's quote, I have much of the same criticism-- he doesn't at all deny the Holocaust. You are crossing a line here, particularly with that quote you cited to. One should be allowed to make an intellectual argument with the regards to the details of an historic narrative without being tagged a racist. That you would characterize Sailer's concern over the use of the words ""near annihilation"" to him being a ""Holocaust denier"" is utterly absurd.

The ""same criticism"" I was referring to was the critique I had of your analysis of the article, which is to say: ""whatever it ignores or doesn't ignore is certainly something you can discuss and critique. That you disagree with it, doesn't make it 'an anti-Semetic article.'""  Meaning of course you have the right to agree or disagree with the points raised by the article and Sailer's comments but you should make those disagreements known without labeling them ""anti-Semitic.""

And what was it that Sailer said that was so offensive by the way?  He acknowledged a Holocaust and he acknowledged 6 million Jews died in the Holocaust.  All he claimed was that the Holocaust did not wipe out Europe's Jewish population and he based this on the claims of numbers of current Jews claiming to be Holocaust survivors versus the number of Jews said to have been killed by the Holocaust.  I have never made any kind of study or analysis of these issues, so I have no real opinion one way or another.  

How is what Sailer said racist?  Did you actually read what he said?  

If you want to genuinely engage in a discussion of this fine, but please do me a favor and engage me in a debate on the substance of the underlying issues rather than insisting I'm a racist.

&gt;Yeah, it will still be fake then.

I thought you said it was ""probable""?  Now you're saying it's certain.  You're contradicting yourself.  Or you lied the first time.

&gt;Do you agree with Mises that fascism had the ""best intentions""?

In the context he wrote that?  Best intentions in stopping the spread of international communism?  Yes.  Stopping international communism is the best of intentions.

Do you agree with Mises that fascism is inherently evil, and not in itself a desirable system, and that if practiced in the long run, will destroy civilization?

&gt;&gt;That does not refute anything said prior such that you are justified in saying ""that's not what happened, THIS is what happened!"" What you just said here is separate and speaks of the US, not fascism in Europe, which was the original context.

&gt;No, I said that fascism in Europe got totally out of hand. 

No, you didn't say that.  Stop lying.  You need to separate what you think from what you actually write.

&gt;This is because it did not have the ""best intentions"". It was a movement to enslave and exterminate people (hey, just like the southern racists!).

That fascism is, in principle, a movement to enslave and exterminate dissenters (which Mises wrote by the way), that does not mean that this is what the Austrian fascists were actually doing at the time Mises wrote ""Liberalism.""

&gt;&gt;Are mathematicians ""fundamentalists"" as well?

&gt;The difference is that mathematics axioms aren't idiotic assumptions about complex human nature.

You didn't answer the question.  

You said that it ""sounds fundamentalist"" for me to say:

""No, that just means there is has been very little successful criticism of the Austrian theory in the more than 100 years it has been around, and hence Austrian theory REQUIRES very little significant changes.""

Well, if I instead said:

""No, that just means there is has been very little successful criticism of calculus theory in the more than 400 years it has been around, and hence calculus theory REQUIRES very little significant changes.""

That would also ""sound fundamentalist.""  It's phrasing it the same exact way!  So your attitude would compel you to admit that mathematics also ""sounds fundamentalist.""

You of course realized the crap of what you said, so you had to make entirely DIFFERENT claim, which is:

""The difference is that mathematics axioms aren't idiotic assumptions about complex human nature.""

Hahahaha

OK, fine, call the human action axiom an ""idiotic assumption about complex human behavior.""  You'd only be ACTING when you criticize it you moron.  You'd have a purposeful goal (smear human action axiom as wrong because it's not ""complex"", which is the tried and true mantra word for sophists like you), you'd be using means to accomplish that goal (your PC, your time, etc), and you did this expecting to make some sort of gain for yourself (probably to make his short-comings feel less painful by deflecting the hate onto others).

You just verified the human action axiom in the course of your smear attempt to discredit it.  Logical people like me call that an illogical claim to make.

&gt;They are simple axioms of set theory or category theory.

The human action axiom is a simple axiom of human life.

&gt;And these axioms define simple symbolic operations and properties to do derivations. 

The human action axiom defines simple behavioral operations and properties to do deductive derivations.

&gt;Praxeology has none of this

Wrong.  It does.  The human action axiom is a simple axiom of human life.  The human action axiom defines simple behavioral operations and properties to do deductive derivations.

&gt;(it pretends that it can capture the actions of the human brain in some sort of logic, while completely ignoring topics like neuroscience, psychology, and so on)

Pure mathematics ignores psychology, neuroscience topics as well.  

&gt;yet it pretends to be as rigorous. 

How can a theory ""pretend"" to do anything?  A theory is a theory.  Only PEOPLE pretend.  And you are a pretender.

&gt;Therefore, praxeology is just pseudo-mathematics.

Yes, praxeology is pseudo-mathematics.  It's not mathematics per se.  It is based on rationalism and logic.

&gt;&gt;Weird, since I find people who advocate for violence against innocent people to be the crazy types.

&gt;Weird, coming from a person that advocates everyone give up their voting rights and just pay mafias protection money.

No, mafias initiate violence.  Private protection and security agencies are not mafias. 

Weird, coming from a person what advocates the ""right"" to vote away the rights of, and hence advocates the initiations of violence towards, the individual.

&gt;&gt;I consider peace advocates like me to be the only sane people in the world.

&gt;This might be true, but humans are not naturally peaceful.

If I act peaceful, then I am naturally peaceful by definition.  

If people in general do not act peacefully, then it makes no sense to give any of them monopoly powers to initiate violence with legal impunity.

You sound like you were beaten as a child.  You see violence everywhere because there was violence in your household.  You then believe the world is just a big household, which means it is necessarily violent everywhere too.

Thus, even if there are peaceful people, then initiate violence against them because that's what it was like in your household, and thus that is what ""human nature"" is allegedly all about.

Your logic is absurd.  Just because some people initiate violence against others, that doesn't mean it is justified to initiate violence against peaceful people.

&gt;Peace is an ideal that we can strive for, but it isn't going to magically happen. 

Of course it's not going to ""magically"" happen.  It will happen by education, through ideas.

It certainly will not happen by never letting peaceful people be free from violence.  If a violent world is going to become peaceful, then obviously peace will necessarily begin with individual choice, not some magical omnipotent God compelling everyone to be peaceful at the same time.  So peace will naturally arise at the individual level, one person at a time.  If then peace is ever going to occur for everyone, then it must be the case that as peaceful individuals arise, THEY OUGHT NOT BE STOPPED.  Once peace spreads, individually, the peaceful people must be completely free from initiations of violence.  If they are not, then peace will never arise.

You might not accept this, but there are way more peaceful people in the world than there are violent people.  And no, this is not because of the minority of violent people.  It is because most people realize that their self-interest is better served through peaceful cooperation.

&gt;Sadly, the only way that the industrialized world stopped directly fighting each other is because of nuclear weapons.

No, that's one reason why GOVERNMENTS stopped fighting other GOVERNMENTS.  Civilians are not at war.  

Since government is inherently violent, then it shouldn't be surprising that the inherent violence will reach a point at which total annihilation is the last step.  Violence IS destructive.  The more violence there is, the more destruction takes place.  That includes human life.  The acme of violence is non-existence.

Governments have been, far and away, the world's biggest murderers, torturers, thieves, rapists, liars, and every other evil imaginable.  People like you fallaciously believe that this means ""human nature"" is inherently violent.  But violence is a choice.  And to not fight against violence, at least intellectually, that is a choice too.  You have made the choice to not only not fight against violence physically and intellectually, but you have joined in the movement FOR violence.  Physically, you're probably peaceful.  But mentally, you are all violence.  This is why I suspect that you have been mentally traumatized through physical or emotional abuse growing up.  If your actions matched your mindset, then you'd be branded a lowly rotten criminal who should be either jailed or killed, depending on how close your actions come to match your mentality.  

You are the very reason you believe ""human nature"" is inherently violent.  It's because YOUR MIND is steeped in violence.  You can't think of peace in others, you can't think of a peaceful way of life, because your mind is full of violent imagery, and is traumatized enough to prevent it from thinking logically and rationally.

The Institute for Historical Review was founded in 1979 by Lewis Brandon, who also served as the first director. (Lewis Brandon is an alias for William David McCalden, a British neo-fascist who in 1975 had founded Britain's National Party, a break-away from the notorious neo-Nazi National Front.)

The IHR operates under the umbrella of the Legion for Survival of Freedom, a registered non-profit corporation in the State of Texas.

The Institute for Historical Review is the moving force in the movement to deny the Holocaust. Its initial meeting was opened by Willis Carto, who also funds the organization, and whom some (including Dennis King, author of the 1989 work ""Lyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism"") credit with starting it. No matter - with McCalden out of the way (he left the IHR, and has since died), the IHR was Carto's mouthpiece, until his forced ouster in late 1994.

As a subset of what you provided above, I've liked everybody to ""[The Icesave Dispute.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icesave_dispute)""  As I've read through it, it doesn't appear clear to me that the sovereign government of Iceland was actually obligated to insure any deposits, nor is it clear that it had made any affirmative statements to that effect.  

I'm going to take a small liberty here and transpose what I believe to be [the major defining dispute explained in the article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icesave_dispute#Deposit_insurance), so that readers don't have to sift through (my highlights):

*As pointed out by the European Court of Justice in the Peter Paul and Others case, ""Directive 94/19 seeks to introduce cover for depositors, wherever deposits are located in the Community, in the event of the unavailability of deposits made with a credit institution which is a member of a deposit guarantee-scheme"". **The directive does not specify how the Member States have to provide the cover**, although most operate some sort of fund to which credit institutions contribute, as in Iceland. **In principle, if the fund cannot meet depositors' claims in the event of a default by a member of the scheme, it is for the remaining credit institutions to make up the difference.** Such a move was impossible in the case of the Tryggingarsj√≥√∞ur as the remaining Icelandic credit institutions were far too small in relation to the claims of Icesave depositors, and a fortiori because **Icelandic law states that ""Member Companies shall not be liable for any commitments entered into by the Fund beyond their statutory contributions to the Fund.**""*

The more legal-minded of the reddit community can - at their leisure - chew over this and decide for themselves what everything really meant.  However, to me, it appears as if this ""guarantee"" was anything but, and there seems to be plenty of wiggle room for the Icelandic government.

It costs about $3,700 per person in Canada to provide healthcare. Government collects in excess of 630 billion in taxes. So about 19% of taxes pays for healthcare. You can buy full coverage insurance for about $3,000 in most of Europe through the private system and it is for world class healthcare with many more perks and faster service than what we get in Canada.

If Canadians got to keep more of their wealth instead of have the horrible bureacracy that we muddle through in place then we could do better by all measures... far shorter wait times, nurses could do more medical advice and treatments than the bureaucracy currently allows them despite their education levels being in many ways on a par with an MD... and their direct experience with patients being WAY WAY more valuable anyway.

We would have charity hospitals that were accountable only to the donors and patients, not to the political catastrophe that is our provincial healthcare DISASTER. We would keep the best doctors coming out of Canadian Universities IN Canada when they start practicing.

I wish this were true. Science was not a necessary result of human society. It's as much a historical aberration as any particular philosophical school. 

Science--true inductive science distinct from empirical philosophy in the vein of Aristotle--was only really invented once in human history. This is not the only place or time it might have arisen. China might have; India might have; the Caliphates might have; Greece and Rome might have; Persia might have; medieval Europe might have. But despite the possibilities, most of the world has been content with philosophical wanderings and technological tinkering for most of human history.

Yet it was only in post-Reformation Europe that true science emerged, it took centuries to take root, and it was many times at risk of being snuffed out in an orgy of bonfires.

The triumph of science in modern civilization was a heroic tale, and not one that needed have happened. I would imagine the odds are that it would eventually be rediscovered if we were to start from scratch, but it's by no means a necessary outcome of cultural development.

You assume government regulations are Canada's saving grace. Not so. America's problem was that the government participated in guaranteeing mortgage loans. Look into what Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac do, and look up the definition of ""moral hazard"". Canada escaped most of that damage simply because no government entity was propping up the mortgage industry, at least not on the same scale as in the US.

Many European countries are verging on bankruptcy directly because of their socialist tendencies and spending patterns.

I've been in the Solar Energy industry since 2007 and I remember meeting personally with some of the Solyndra leaders/founders back in 2008 when they where doing a sales run in Europe and bumped into them again a couple of times again back in 2009 in European conferences. As an Engineer my opinion of their tech was that it had a very defined niche in the market. The whole bit about passive tracking from their geometry seemed more novelty than practical to me. Hard to imagine that geometry becoming cost competitive with regular flat panels in the long run, I told my bosses that. Basically their niche was rooftop installations where the windload and snowload of regular flat panels would be an issue. The guys I met where pretty nice and I always wished them the best of luck as their product had its place in the market. However I do think they where overselling the idea and had too high expectations of their possible market share. They also never seemed to reach their target/marketed efficiency specs the few times I saw them again. Last times I saw one of the guys he was no longer even with Solyndra. At which time I figured the project was dead.

I'm surprised to find out they got so much funding and further surprised that they dropped the ball given that amount of support.

I don't like they way China runs things, but I still think that Solyndra was an interesting idea that was never really geared for long term success. Their niche was specific and their advantage regarding the price of silicon was doomed to disappear.

The maesters seem to like keeping their know-how mysterious and vital. This affords them stations in all of the key castles and courts, keeps them funded and relatively safe.

I'm going to go with the date being concurrent with the books and me appearing somewhere with a similar current climate to where I reside on Earth. I'm also assuming Westerosi = English.

First thing, if my clothes are not matched to the period, I would make my clothes ragged, cover them with mud (to hide the material and design), and give myself a mugged look, so when asked I can claim to be a tradesman/traveler who was robbed/beaten. If approached, I won't look like much to hostiles, and can ask for aid from friendlies. Next step is to find the nearest village where I could talk to a few people, beg for help, probably play amnesiac to mitigate questions of my origin, and hopefully get asked if I'm from a particular place based on my accent. That would make faking a name/place of origin much easier. Hard to claim you're from Westeros if you sound like a Pentoshi. Then I could offer to do some basic services/work, in exchange for food &amp; clothing. 

Once cleaned up, I can go to the next village over or start my new life there, as I ""try to remember who I am and how I learned what I know"". This also gives cover for not having a ready knowledge of local custom, slang, and various traditions.

Once I have some trust, or arrive at a new village, I would offer my services as a builder of structures and improvements to existing structures: reinforced concrete, notching/interlocking stone-work, canted plinths, round towers, shingles in place of thatch, insulation, caulk, stoves, etc.. up to late 18th century Europe levels. Not all at once or all in the same place, appearing to know too much can make people nervous.

I would introduce things like boiled water or refined alcohol subtly, describing it as a ""traditional medicine/practice from my village/town"", boiling water/distilling alcohol with something harmless sprinkled in it can make it more believable. If I can extract enough alkali's from hardwood ashes, I might  make bleach of some sort, or at least lye soap. These would get a reasonable amount of money, spread helpful knowledge but (hopefully) not enough to become a threat to anyone's lively-hood.

I'd experiment to see if charcoal can be made or a source of coal found (IIRC neither is mentioned in the books). If so, it won't take black-smiths long to start taking advantage of the increased heat, thus giving them better steel with an higher carbon content. It would also be a boon to mining operations in smelting/refining metal-bearing ores and could lead to the introduction of nikel, zinc, others, and various alloys you cannot produce with wood-fire-heat. Once I have a reasonable amount of $$, I would quietly collect components to see if I can produce basic explosives (gunpowder, nitroglycerin (if the above lye idea works), incendiaries, etc.., Most of which would be fairly primitive but, if chemistry works, I can then start small selling the magical material to mine operators, or quarries. Maybe the occasional, very discrete, sale to an ambitious lord.  

The key would be to spread (sell them the ""secret"" of how to do/make) enough knowledge to make a tidy bit of $$, then move on to another town, change my appearance and name, this will help avoid catching unwanted attention from a greedy lord, a jealous maester, or angry priest. I would hope to make a few close/trustworthy friends to travel with me until we are wealthy enough to retire, preferably someone that can teach me enough swordsmanship to survive an attempted robbery along the road.

 The constant travel and new places would suit my nomadic spirit and not being tied to a particular faction would make it easier to slip away when war comes near. Having a lord/patron would have some advantages but I'm bad enough at office politics to know I need to stay very far from win-or-die politics of Westeros.

t1_c2gtlnl,0,c2gu4yp,"&gt;Firstly I don't consider all tax to be theft. I said that income tax is theft.

Why?  What makes income tax different from any other tax?

&gt;It costs about $3,700 per person in Canada to provide healthcare. Government collects in excess of 630 billion in taxes. So about 19% of taxes pays for healthcare. You can buy full coverage insurance for about $3,000 in most of Europe through the private system and it is for world class healthcare with many more perks and faster service than what we get in Canada.

Healthcare in Canada is like cell phones in Canada.  It's more expensive than any country in europe because of the infrastructure required to cover an area 14 times larger than france is somewhat more expensive than that required for an area the size of.. well... France.  Also, almost all of Europe, save Turkey, have socialized healthcare with the ability to purchase supplementary coverage.  Same as us.  A complaint about the effectiveness of how our healthcare system is managed is not an argument against taxes.

&gt;If Canadians got to keep more of their wealth instead of have the horrible bureacracy that we muddle through in place then we could do better by all measures... far shorter wait times, nurses could do more medical advice and treatments than the bureaucracy currently allows them despite their education levels being in many ways on a par with an MD... and their direct experience with patients being WAY WAY more valuable anyway.

The amount we pay for our healthcare gives us better coverage than if we each bough individual insurance with the added bonus of not screwing over people who get sick while poor.  In America, where they DON'T have universal healthcare, we see people overpaying for less all the time due to corporate monopolies and oligarchies in each area.

And what nurses can and cannot do would be basically unaffected because the laws would remain the same.  Again, that's not an argument against taxes.  It's an argument against the current management of healthcare.

&gt;We would have charity hospitals that were accountable only to the donors and patients, not to the political catastrophe that is our provincial healthcare DISASTER. We would keep the best doctors coming out of Canadian Universities IN Canada when they start practicing.

Based on what evidence?

&gt;There are so many advantages I could go on for ages.

Could you back any of them up with actual real world evidence?  Because you can't use a socialized country to argue against socialism.  You have to use one without universal healthcare.

Another aspect of history the tensions arise from is how, like in many other colonized parts of the world, the European settlers tried very hard to westernize Maori. Te Reo was outlawed and many Maori were forced into Christianity. 

I think the difference comes in in that after awhile the Europeans saw them as 'noble savages' and lamented the 'dieing race' (see the monument on One Tree Hill in Auckland). The Maori population was in a decline. However after awhile they started to go up in population again and have been on the rise ever since the 1920's I believe. 

I think the 'difference' is that there are just a lot more Maori relative to the New Zealand population. But there can be lots of tension and strife.

Jusqu'√† r√©cemment l'√¢ge de consentement √©tait de 14 ans, et si on remonte plus loin l'√¢ge adulte √©tait de 15 ans, m√™me au Canada (en Nouvelle France du moins). 

De plus, la d√©finition scientifique de la p√©dophilie en tant que maladie mentale rel√®ve de la communaut√© scientifique, pas de la l√©gislature. Si on lit le ICD-10 o√π DSM-IV, on trouve que la p√©dophilie est d√©ifinie comme une attirance sexuelle constante envers des enfants pr√©puberts (en g√©n√©rale, 13 ans et moins). 

Donc, la dame en question, dans un proc√®s, pourra √™tre accus√© d'aggression sexuelle du fait qu'elle a eu des relations avec un mineur, c'est-√†-dire que *selon la loi* un mineur ne peut pas consentir √† des relations sexuelles avec un adulte.

&gt;Alors oui, quelqu'un qui aggresse sexuellement un enfant a in√©vitablement une attirance probablement sexuelle envers celui-ci, et √ßa fait de lui un p√©dophile.

Cette affirmation est compl√®tement ridicule. Lisez plus haut.

t1_c2gu1w5,0,c2guaqc,"It's not so much embarassing as culturally inappropriate. Most service jobs are relatively well paid in Britain (and much of the rest of Europe) compared to North America, and staff don't *need* tips to supplement their income. A tip is more in thanks for particularly good service than performance related pay. Most Brits also prefer a different style of service to what you generally see over the pond. We like our waiters to be friendly but unobtrusive, whereas each time I've visited the States or Canada I've had a difficult time getting my 'server' to leave me alone and not keep trying to make upsells or engratiate themselves with me to earn a higher tip. We don't want to be entertained, just to enjoy a hastle-free meal in whatever company we came with.

Anyway I digress. I've worked pub bars, as well as being a waiter and cocktail barman and the tipping culture is different in all three. As a rule of thumb **never** tip in a pub. If it's quiet and you're standing and chatting to the barman, by all means offer to buy him a drink, he'll either save it til the end of his shift or just take the cash, but it's far from compulsory. In a restaurant, tipping is fine, and even sometimes expected but you should feel free not to leave anything if you weren't happy with the service. Remember that we're already paid to bring you your food and take your order, the tip is for anything extra such as being particularly efficient, friendly, or handling large groups or special requests. In a cocktail bar tipping is acceptable, but far from required. These guys are crafting something for you, so if it's special you can tip, but only *after* you've tried the drink. I love getting a patron who says something like ""that was one of the best brandy alexanders I've had, thanks very much"" and slips me a tip. I might even pass him an extra shot by way of thanks. What I hate is guys who come in and flash cash as if they think they can buy special treatment. We'll serve everyone in turn, unless you are a particularly attractive member of the opposite sex... (hey, we're only human!) 

If you remember nothing else remember this. British pubs, bars and restaurants are pretty socially equitable places, and this applies to the treatment of other patrons and staff. People who wave money at barmen, shout their orders at them when they're not being addressed or generally act like they're the master get pretty short shrift. People who are polite, wait their turn and are friendly will always get a good reception. The customer isn't always right here, and serving a nice person has a much more positive affect on your day than a jackass who happens to tip well at the end.

Here is what you have to understand about the Koran.  The Koran is NOT a book.  As a matter of fact the Koran was never written down on page until 40 years AFTER Muhammad's death.  The Koran was literally what it claims to be, that is a revelation.  During the spread of the message of Islam the Koran was recited from person to person, heart to heart.  It was written in hearts before it was ever written down on a paper.  So really its not something that can be drafted, edited, re-edited, thought up of, etc.  Which are things usually attributed to literally works.  Since after all Muhammad could not read nor right...

What I find amazing about the Koran? That is a very dumb question.  Lets ignore the fact that whole empires have sprung by adhering to its mere 400 + pages.  Lets ignore the fact that a whole scientific renaissance had been birthed by its pages, ignore the fact that it had transformed the Arabs, who were nothing but tribal and barbaric at best, into a global force that moved an empire that sprawled 1/3 of the world, upstarted a scientific revolution and pulled Europe out of the Dark ages.  Let us also ignore the fact that it is the only perfect work of Arabic with no grammatical errors or imperfections in its wordings, which you claim an illiterate man created.  It is a really ignorant and unknowing question to ask what is so important/amazing about the Koran.  To answer your last question I will leave you with a quote from one of histories greatest geniuses, a man of considerable knowledge, Thomas Carlyle:


""As you read the Qur'an al-karim, you will presently realize that it is not an ordinary tome of literature. The Qur'an al-karim is a work of art that springs from a heart and instantly penetrates all the other hearts. All the other works of art are quite dull when compared with this tremendous masterpiece. The most striking characteristic of the Qur'an al-karim is that it is a truthful and excellent guide. To me, this is the greatest merit of Qur'an al-karim.

Yes, our team is bad (though nobody here cares when we lose to Haiti).

Our biggest problem is that football is even lower in the totem pole of sports than in it is in multi-sport developed countries like Australia and the USA.  Baseball is the first (second and third) sport of the island, followed in the distance by basketball and later by volleyball (though that is especially true in women's sports).  Football is probably next, along with track and field.  Being the most popular sport in the country counts for a lot, as it determines which sport is easiest to find ""quorum"" for at the grassroots level.  Frankly, Dominicans will likely never see football as a better opportunity than baseball, and I'm fine with that.

Our second biggest problem is an incompetent FA that pockets a lot of the FIFA GOAL project money (a corrupt Caribbean FA, who's ever heard of that, amirite?) and can't take advantage of what little interest there is in football in the country.  We're a country with 10 million people who couldn't provide a stadium that was up to FIFA specs for qualifying last time.  We actually have plenty of talent available to us (thanks to the large Dominican diaspora in the US and Spain), but the FA doesn't make it a priority to recruit it for national team matches.  Last election, the current FA president was set to lose to a challenger that was supported by all the club academies in the country, but was disqualified for BS reasons two days prior to the election.  All in all, we are not by any means a football country, but any progress we could make goes unfulfilled because our FA is both corrupt and incompetent.

Third is just a general lack of exposure which creates a ""chicken or the egg"" problem with football's popularity.  Football isn't popular because it's rarely aired on TV.  Football is rarely aired on TV because it isn't popular.  Although European football is now available with the cable companies, the local league and national team **rarely** get any exposure.  I have gone to Atletico Barcelona matches (the Santo Domingo team in La Liga Mayor), but have never seen them on TV.  Ask anyone about this Friday's World Cup qualifying match against El Salvador, and less than 1 in 10 Dominicans will have any idea that it's even happening.  Those who do are just because they read that blurb at the end of the sports section, and don't care that our national team is playing anyway.

The Dominican Republic has the potential to be a regional power, meaning that we could work our way toward being one of the top 5 teams in the Caribbean, and one day even fulfill the dream of making it into the Gold Cup (yes, that is the 20 year goal for now).  But we need to start making progress with what we do have.  That is, football development in the northern provinces (where the immigrant Haitian community has more influence), talented diaspora Dominicans that grew up in Spain (we have a young CB in La Masia who is in Juvenil A right now, meaning he could get promoted to Barca B in a year or two) and the US, and the development of the MLS all point to opportunities for growth for Dominican players.

Intelligence can't be measured by brain size, or volume. Some microcephalics have brain volumes of less than 500cc but their IQs are in the region of 70-80. Which is pretty incredible.

And pure intelligence is NOT the wonderful thing you seem to think it is. Nor does it necessarily mean evolutionary success.

There is a ""spark"" which separates humans from neanderthals and other animals, but it is not easy to define what that spark is, nor when it developed.

What we can say for sure though, is that this spark developed in Africa some time after the ancestors of Neanderthal had already left Africa.

It also seem logical to surmise that it was Neanderthal's massive brain which may have been its undoing: A brain of that size requires a stupendous amount of food, and neanderthals have been proven to consist on a diet of almost pure meat - even when living alongside rivers bursting with Sturgeon and other fish.

They seem to not have been very adaptable in terms of their technology: they had a basic set of tools and they simply used those tools in different ways everywhere they went - for 200,000+ years.

This is entirely different to how humans colonised Europe: they developed their technology as they went, and made maximum use of any and ALL food types they could acquire.

These differences might allow us to say that we were not only smarter, but more adaptable, and more capable adapting to changing climates and different environments.

Is it normal to talk about something that has no relevance to the discussion? For example should I talk about China's influence in the world today or should I stay on subject?

I tried to reply to most of your essay, but if i missed something, its only because of the length not avoidance. That being said I'm gonna keep it brief from now on because your obviously ignoring most of what I have to say.

&gt;Pssst. Do you even know why it is called Palestine? Or why the Palestinians are called Palestinians? Or are you spewing the same message of hatred you were brainwashed to without actually knowing any facts? Let me give you a hint. This area was called Palestine LONG before there ever was a Muslim...

**Palestinians are not just Muslim's so please do not be another xenophobic Zionist. There are Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Druze, and Atheist Palestians, to say the least.

Palestinians are for all intents and purposes ""people who originate and have historically lived in the region now known as Israel but previously the British Mandate of Palestine, and before that the Palestinian State in the Ottoman Empire, or Uthmania.""** 

&gt;I guess Mark Twain was also a fool, who said when he travelled through in 1867 described Israel as a ""...desolate country"" and ""We never saw a human being on the whole route"" (from Innocents Abroad).
 
I'm sure the people who brought Mr.Twain to investigate were of course unbiased in their views... /s

&gt;Or maybe the Royal Commission in 1913 right after the Turks left (this was way before any of your so claimed (yet false) ""Israeli favouritism"") said ""The road leading from Gaza to the north was only a summer track suitable for transport by camels and carts"" and ""The villages in this area were few and thinly populated... many villages were deserted by their inhabitants."" 

The Zionist favoritism is well documented in the British Histories and all one needs to do is look up the Balfour declaration.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration_of_1917

""His Majesty's government view with **favour** the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.""

&gt;So maybe we aren't the fools? Maybe you are brainwashed with false history that doesn't hold up with the actual FACTS from history documents (if you would of actually read one).

The thing is I'm well versed in the history but the issue with Zionism is that there is a brainwashing effect that occurs when stories arise of how a possible new Holocaust or how Israel is the only hope for Jews, and this leads to a blatant ignorance of the morals and laws being broken.

The truth is there is a Zionist way of Deception or Hiding things such as the mass immigration from Europe. They do not like to talk about how the population numbers jumped from 3% in Palestine to what they are today. They do not talk about **Aliyah** because they know that this would de-ligitimize their hope for acceptance in any court of law that recognizes ethnic cleansing as a crime or removal of refugee's even.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah

&gt;Ahh yes, Palestinian gays that need to go to their hated settlers to save them from being butchered from their own people. Or Iran a country which ""... has no gays"". Or Egypt, where they are kicked out of the country. Or Saudi Arabia where they can get imprisoned or brain washed. Great countries one by one.

I'm sure you have all your information but I would look outside of CNN and Fox News, because sound bites are not facts. There are gays in all countries, so deal with it. Israel is not a safe haven for Gays. While there is discrimination there is also acceptance, so don't try and paint a black and white picture.

&gt;So what, you want revenge? Now the Jews (and any non Arab/Muslim living here) need to suffer the same thing that supposedly happened? Maybe we should give all of this land back to Turkey since tey had it before the British took it brutally away from them! Or maybe Rome! Lets give it back to them!

t3_k1ndq,0,c2gup8z,"This is amazingly shortsighted. While one could negate the entire premise of the post by showing how most private non-profit colleges are doing just fine, unlike newspapers, I'll give some direct critiques. Here's a few problems with it:

1. **Costs are going up isn't a problem** - While this is true, its not because hiring a professor or buying classroom space has becoming insanely more expensive. Colleges are now in an amenities war to attract the best students. New gyms. Nice dorms. Big science buildings. These have nothing to do with being unable to take advantage of the reduced cost of learning. American universities are far different than the rest of the world for the self-sufficient communities they are. There's a reason there aren't any European/South American style commuter schools at the top of the elite universities list. Its because students want to go to places that are really enjoyable to live for 4 years and pay for it. 

2. **Price =/= Cost** Colleges have increased tuition mostly because they've found that people can and are willing to pay more. They've found formulas that allow them to price descriminate very well and capture as much as a person can pay, which they've found is pretty darn high. They could charge less tuition, but why do that when they can add more to the endowment and build a new building with the proceeds.

3.**The point of college** - Mr. Harvard seems to have no clue what makes colleges like his his alma mater great. Its not professors who do great research or some curriculum that they teach differently or great education technology. Its the fact that a few thousand of the worlds smartest 12-22 year olds are interacting and living in close quarters every single day, consciously or subconsciously learning, bouncing ideas off each other, etc. 

Reading a newspaper online is more or less the same as reading one in person. Newspapers have slightly held on because there are some people that value the feel of a physical newspaper. 

Colleges are in no way the same thing as newspapers. The online version isn't a substitute for the physical one. Yglesias certainly could have watched his Harvard lectures over the internet, turned his paper in electronically, and lived in the woods in Montana. He wouldn't be nearly the same person without the peer effects elite colleges bring.

t1_c2guf0g,0,c2gupx5,"Real Estate is an asset class in and of itself. It's arguably the largest cap asset class that exists (outside of fraudulent debt derivatives of course :P). People seem to forget this. It's a difficult asset class to understand because you can't just buy it at the click of an internet broker. Because of that lack of understanding they are averse to it.

What I'm waiting for is a significant enough bust, and going into class B properties. These are properties that stray away from the suburbs into smaller towns and are better suited to lower incomes. I may use one unit of the 2-3-4plex to live in and rent out the rest, build my equity. These properties are nice because they don't appreciate or depreciate as sharply as the suburban median houses do.

It's been said that when these properties start to live, people have to live somewhere. They will move somewhere that accommodates their budget best; low income properties. Real Estate is interesting because it's an asset class you can go long in either a bull or bear market. You just have to be in the right type of real estate. That's the trick.

The reason why Real Estate is easy to get a loan for is because there's collateral! The lenders actually have something physical. That's the x factor to building wealth is how easy it is to leverage for a cashflow investment.

As for equities though I do disagree. It's been a dead cat bounce since 2008; inflation has just masked the gains XD compared to gold and silver, their doors have been completely blown off over the last 10 years. I still find them to be fundamentally overvalued, given their ridiculously high PE ratios and pitiful dividend yields on the indexes, along with what appears to be a deflationary dip. Banks especially. They're the ones that get whacked in a deflationary environments like a mafia target. Just look at all the european banks.

""America"" has never been a country. The one the author believes he's referring to is the ""United States"". Every nation in North America or South America has a right to the word ""America"". Including, at the time, the Confederate States of America.

&gt; So, Just to make sure I‚Äôm clear on this, you‚Äôre a proud patriotic American who loves the United States which is why you display the battle symbol of a long defunct political/military organization that directly and without equivocation attempted to destroy that self same country.

I believe that this organization attempted to secede from the United States. Such an act did not destroy the United States, nor was it intended to do so. In fact, the majority of battles happened not on non-seceding lands, but on land of the various confederate states.

So, if one was trying to destroy the other, it was not the confederates guilty of such an  attempt. If one was burning the cities of the other to the ground, it was not the confederates guilty of this.

&gt; Because, see, so far as I can tell, people like you seem to hate just about everything that makes the United States what it is.

You *could* argue that the protest were the result of NATO machinations but rebels seem to be equally made up of everyday citizens along with disgruntled generals and politicians. The Iranian coup was largely carried out by a handful of soldiers and military officers.

 Also Mossedegh was in the process of nationalizing the countries oil which would greatly cut into BP's (yes, *that* BP) profits, the company that pretty much had full control of Iran's oil and would pay rent on the wells. It was a really shitty deal for the Iranians as 70+ percent of the profits were leaving the country and the money that stayed in was largely going to individuals that appeased the British oil industry.

 From my understanding, Gaddafi cut some pretty rad deals with western oil companies in the last few decades, especially in Europe so its not like there was oil the west wasn't getting their hands on, in fact, I would argue that NATO countries were putting a lot the line by providing air support to this spontaneous and haphazard rebellion if oil was the chief concern.

I don't know what percentage of Oil goes to France already but 35% seems more like the number for all Oil exports to Europe that already exist, so some contracts would have to be switched around if France was to get a better deal. 

IMHO the first real test of how stable the NTC is will be how they assimilate the Gaddafi Regime, like if it will be near seamless or if there will be Chzek style witchhunts for years to come.

Post:

At Gamescom, I had the opportunity to discuss the CE with the EU Namco team, who were more than happy to spell out EXACTLY how it's going to work.

The reason for the confusion is that the EU and US are getting slightly different things.

The US Collectors Edition consists of a metal case, with digital collectables, possibly a physical soundtrack and/or artbook. Because of the size of the metal case, the strategy guide has to be digital too.

The EU Collectors Edition is a folding cardboard-ey thing, you know what I mean. However, it comes with a physical making-of/behind the scenes thing, a physical art book, a physical soundtrack and a code for a digital strategy guide, because it made no sense to make two different guides for two different regions (looking at you, Atlus).

I will double check and update to see if the US one has any physical collectables, it's possible it doesn't.
Also worth noting is the fact that the EU version comes with codes for the digital versions of the art book/soundtrack etc as well as the physical ones.

As for alternative fuels in everyday transportation, it was actually private industry that destroyed the electric car back in the 90's.  There was a great documentary I watched called ""Who Killed the Electric Car?""  Some great digging was done in that documentary.  There's also another one more recently called ""Fuel"" (I think that was what it was called anyways) which talks about biodiesel being both easier and cheaper while having almost no environmental effects compared to gasoline.

It's really interesting to see the journeys that lead us here! Anyway, here's mine.

**1. Background:** first gems: [Microsoft Decathlon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y5Zmrr_Mvc), [Grand Prix Circuit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiTWIDbD8Q4) and various sports games. As a teenager, all kinds of adventures and RPG's until LAN and a bit later Internet gaming became popular and got me hooked on multi-player games. Competitively played shooters (**Quake2 CTF**) online until **DAoC** become my first MMO (just a month, no time for more back then). Played **WoW** (vanilla-WOTLK) in one of the top raiding guilds. Stopped playing shooters at that point, but continued to play RPG's.
After WoW, I had one amazing year of **EVE Online** PvP, and then settled for more casual MMO play (Lotro, Fallen Earth, Rift).

**2. Favorite Game:** I like how others have split this up in online and offline (as it allows to pick two ;=). 
Online I'll choose **Quake 2 CTF**. It was a highly competitive shooter with instant respawn (unlike CounterStrike) that required a ton of practice to master. Although Quake2 itself was slow, the grappling hook mechanic made CTF very fast paced and to this day still my favorite esport experience.
Offline I ll go with (patched) **Fallout 1 &amp; 2**. Great replay value for an RPG, memorable game world, various play-styles to master the games.

**3. Other games:** WoW, Planescape Torment, EVE Online, Monkey Island, Jagged Alliance, Wizardry, Diablo, Mechwarrior Mercenaries, Baldur's Gate, KOTOR, Mass Effect 2 (the story/universe - rich enough to spawn an MMO - had they not gotten the rights to Star Wars I could have seen something like ME:TOR)

**4. Favorite MMO:** I seriously lucked out with my WoW journey, could write a book about it. Despite being from Europe, I decided to start playing on an US server (to improve my English) two weeks after release. I didn't know know anyone but quickly made some friends while leveling and finally picked a guild at lvl 45ish because the guild leaders knowledge and generosity impressed me. Became an officer in the guild, and enjoyed the transformation from a bunch of friends and nobodies to top raiding guild. Biggest guild achievement was the worlds first Blackwing Lair clear. Continued to have tons of fun in the game, but stopped playing a few months at times due to the timezone difference and real-life obligations.
Nevertheless as others have listed already, what made it special was just the atmosphere in the guild. We were highly competitive, but that didn't keep us from finding time to play with more casual family and friends. I've met some of the nicest people playing MMO's.

**5. Expectations:** I expect the game to grip me in a way that Wow did. I am rational and understand it is a different game that just as well will need at least a year for polish, but I'm happy about a lot of design decisions made and can't wait to finally step a foot into the world. I plan to play SWTOR for years, but my time allocation with the game will be shifting around heavily.

**6. Playing the game: ** I'll start off testing a few classes, get drawn into the story and pvp as if theres no tomorrow. I ll return to do some raiding, though not in a cutting edge raid guild anymore (it's just too time consuming). 

**7. Type of gamer:** I am kind of mixed on the Bartle test, I'd describe myself as an explorer during leveling, socializer/leader at level cap. I haven't decided yet what to do with guilds, as there are several I'd love to play with.

&gt; Seriously. Check the Wiki

I've seen this -- it has the wrong emphasis and analysis.  The Dark Ages Europeans knew next to nothing of logic even after they recovered Aristotle.  This page does nothing to dispell this, other than to claim otherwise.  Its ridiculous ‚Äì you cannot claim to be scientific or logical and then offer absolutely not one iota of evidence in support.

&gt; Look. I'ma lay this out for you. Up until the late Enlightenment people did science because they wanted to learn about and become closer to god.

You are mistaken.  At least in Europe, they didn't do science at all until they got access to it from the Arabs (around 1200).  Then it was a slow process of integration before a real turning point happened in the 1500s.

&gt; [...] When Rome withdrew to Byzantium [‚Ä¶] So you have a backwater, isolated from trade with the Mediterranean and the East, into which a small number of Christians are moving to attempt to convert, culturally and religiously, huge numbers of pagans. [...]

So you are making excuses for them, even though you claim they were doing science anyway? Hypocrisy much?

&gt; Shit, Galileo? Galileo lived a thousand years after the middle ages, well into the Renaissance, at the end of the 1500's.

Correct.  I was trying to isolate a case of Christian imposition even when they weren't under the complete cloud of the Dark Ages.  If you don't like that example, you can just look up Peter Abelard, who was similarly persecuted.

&gt; [...] And he was a devout Christian arguing for support of Heliocentrism based on the Augustinian tradition of scriptural interpretation. [...]

You mean this Augustine:

‚ÄúFaith is to believe what you do not see; the reward of this faith is to see what you believe.‚Äù

Galileo made a career out of believing what he saw (a concept inherited from the Arabs.)

&gt; The order handed down to him was not ""Never speak of this"", but ""You can discuss the hypotheses but you may not claim that it is true. Surprise surprise! The Church didn't ban the idea.

Since when does the Church ever get to hand down ANY order about how science should be practiced one way or another?  This is tantamount to immediately conceding the entire argument.

Al Ghazali over in the Arabic empire attempted to stop scientists from engaging in their work by his famous treatise ‚ÄúIncoherence of the Philosophers‚Äù.  The Arabic scientist response was to say STFU to him and increase their scientific output after that point.  No Imam tried any Arab scientist for engaging in science.  Your defense is that Galileo wasn't completely banned from private investigations of science and only persecuted after he produced his results?

&gt; When Galileo really got in trouble it was not simply ""Dur science BURN BURN BURN!"" Galileo had been asked, by the Pope no less, to write a book laying out the arguments for Geocentrism and Heliocentrism, without favouring one or the other, and to include the Popes own views.

How is this a defense of your point?  Scientists don't engage in science in response to edicts from religious authorities.  That *is* anti-science.  There is no defense of geocentrism from a scientific point of view.  Can you imagine if Pope Ratzinger told Richard Dawkins to write a book in defense of both evolution and intelligent design?

&gt; This is the Pope, the highest authority in Christianity, saying ""I respect your views as equal to my own and worthy of serious discussion and consideration. please put my views on equal footing with your own in this book.""

No, this is your personal brain failure resulting in this interpretation to this particularly anti-science action by the church.

&gt; [...] Fucking think about that for a second. The Pope respected Galileo's views enough to request he write a fucking book about them, setting them right next to The Pope's own views.

You just said yourself that the Pope wanted support for heliocentrism and geocentrism.  Suppose Galileo had actually done that.  Can you take one wild guess as to what the most censoring organization in the history of humanity would do with this book which separates into two nice neat arguments, one for the church's teachings and one against them?  The trick is to think about it for *more* than just one second.

&gt; When Galileo actually wrote the book he made the Pope sound like a fool and strongly argued in favor of Heliocentrism.

Of course.  Science is a process that has conclusions.  You don't get to pick two conclusions beforehand and fill some ""science"" that gets you to either one you want.  The simple fact is that you actually cannot make an observation in support of geocentrism.  You can only claim it through some external argument.  The pope was asking for something science could not deliver.

&gt; To his friend the Pope this looked like a double betrayal. First, making the Pope look a fool during a time when he was in an extremely dangerous and delicate position, and secondly doing so while flying in the face of the Pope's own request that the book be written with both arguments laid out.

Yes, the pope was telling a scientist how to think and he didn't get the response he wanted.  You are explaining the details without diminishing the point or the problem in any way whatsoever.

&gt; Keep in mind that Heliocentrism was not an obvious truth. Geocentrism persisted as a model of the solar system for centuries not because people are stupid, but because that model, in the absence of a theory of gravitation, powerful telescopes, and extremely precise astronomical measurements, fits all available evidence and data.

Geocentrism was not just a geometrical model of the solar system.  It proceeded from Aristotle's *cosmology*.  In Aristotle's view, things revolved around the earth because the earth was the only source of ‚Äúheaviness‚Äù as he called it.  Galileo made no observations whatsoever that confirmed or denied the mathematical model of heliocentrism versus geocentrism.  What he instead did was that he observed that other planets had moons and therefore that the earth was not the only thing around which other things orbited, and therefore not the only source of ‚Äúheaviness‚Äù and that therefore Aristotle's cosmology was demonstrably wrong.  This allows for the heliocentric model to have at least equal standing (which at this time was only supported by whatever arguments Copernicus put forth), while undermining the central argument that existed at the time that favored geocentrism.

For the church this was terrible.  Aristotle was the one person from the Greek antiquity that they had recovered, and embraced.  The church invented scholasticism as their perversion of the way Aristotle's logic worked, under the delusion that they were justified in this exercise by Aristotle himself.  So he was iconic to the point where his teachings were equal to that of church doctrine.  To contradict him (which the Arabs had already done hundreds of years earlier, BTW, using nothing more than logical analysis of his argument and the strength of alternative models) was basically sacrilege and an attack on him was like an attack on the intellectual center of the church.

At the end of the day, it wasn't just some pope, but the church itself which got its face slapped by Galileo.  Complaining about Galileo following the force of the evidence or his way of presenting his findings is just excusism (Fox news would be proud).  The study of science means allowing investigation to happen freely and for the investigation to produce the conclusions, not conforming to presuppositions.

&gt; [...] If you don't clearly understand that all objects attract one another, and if you can only view the stars with your naked eye, Geocentrism fits the observable data.

Geocentrism always fits observable data.  Its just that some observable data makes the explanation absurd compared to heliocentrism.  And that happened due to Kepler, not Newton.

&gt; And the idea was not blindly accepted. As new data became available the Geocentric model was elaborated on to account for it.

The Christians had to be fed the entire models from the arabs.  Data was no good to Christians who were incapable of processing it.  The only people doing elaboration were Arabs  then European scientists once they were scientifically mature enough to engage in science.  But this immediately started with heliocentrism, not geocentrism.  So the Christians had nothing to do with improvements to the geocentric models.

The church was in favor of a very static, unchanging presuppositionalist view of the universe.  That's why the church made no progress prior to the infusion of Arab sciences, and that's why they persecuted Galileo (and that's why the church did not rescind its condemnation of Galileo until Pope John Paul II).

&gt; This was very much in the manner of Physicists in the late 19th century trying to come up with a model for the Atom. They knew it was there, they had an idea of what it did, but they weren't sure why, or exactly how, and so based their models on the best evidence.

The cases are not analogous.  Models for the atom were always based on physics.  Models for the solar system were initially based on Aristotle's cosmology; the ideology known as ""Astrology"".  The church supported the ideology, not the science.

&gt; Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Far from being dogmatically opposed to the idea of Heliocentrism, the Pope was willing to allow the idea to be discussed openly [...]

I call bullshit.  The pope was telling a scientist how to conduct science, and had no idea what observations went into geocentric models.  If the church was so open to science, why didn't some priest just look through Galileo's telescope (or make their own)?

""No, basic economics - as opposed to your use of anecdote - carries the point. It's called opportunity costs.""

So you didn't acknowledge that it's an investment.

The *risk* associated with an investment is NOT the opportunity cost.  They are completely separate topics.  

The opportunity cost of going to school is not working and passing over that income.  If those same amount of loans available were available to you regardless, and you spent it on education, that would be opportunity cost. 

Since the loans are not available to you otherwise, the loans themselves are not opportunity cost.

At any rate, regardless of all of that, the *Risk* associated with a loan is not an opportunity cost, which is what you stated. 

&gt;Loans, not scholarships or aid, are the principle way that Americans, poor and middle class alike, pay for higher education. For why this is problematic, see above.

Except it's not problematic.  People pay much higher taxes in Europe, so we have higher after income taxes for people with degrees.  That isn't true in Europe.

Yes, the church was telling a scientist how to do science.

&gt; 2.) Galileo, probably without any malice, managed to grievously offend the Pope by portraying him as foolish in the resulting book.

The church does this all by itself.  But regardless, why are insults a justification for attempting to censor science?

&gt; 3.) Having offended the Pope Galileo lost his protection. This created an opportunity for Galileo's enemies and detractors an opportunity to silence him.

Ok.  So explain to me why doesn't this just expand into the theory: Whenever a scientist was trying to make a discovery, he ends up (usually artificially) offending some church authority who then proceeds to incite his enemies to act against him and therefore undermine any attempt at scientific progress.

Your argument does not support your premise.

&gt; 4.) For largely political reasons Galileo was tried for Heresy. Having made an enemy of the Pope, who had supported him in discussing his ideas, having offended both scientists and religious parties with his radical new ideas, and having given his enemies the perfect opportunity to dispose of him, he was sentenced to house arrest and his publications were suppressed.

Again, by describing the details, you in no way dimish the overall process of what was going on.

&gt; This is not simple. This is not easy. This is not at all like what you read in the History books. History does not and cannot conform to the ideological battles of the present. And in laying the conflicts of the present over the affairs of the past you debase yourself and cheapen your own beliefs.

My history books are fairly good at telling me the sources and processes of science in ages past.  And *that* is all that is necessary to understand this issue.

&gt; PS - Aquaducts are pretty cool. Christendom lost the technology.

The point is that they lost technology they should have *inherited*.  Its one thing to lose track of something, its yet another to have it and then deliberately just throw it away (which the Christians did, with the entire Roman/Greek culture they came from).

&gt; [...] Then they invented shit like Flying Buttresses, in the 10th century, before the Crusades and during the height of the ""Dark Ages"".

And what scientific principle did this solve?

&gt; Look at this. A lot of it seems obvious to us...

No.  The key points are that 1) none are based on pure science and 2) most was invented *after* they made contact and/or obtained culture/science from the Arabs.  These are a list of incremental technologies.  Not one single principle of science.  You can compare it to any of the 3 societies: 1) The Roman/Greeks that immediately preceeded them, 2) The arabs who were contemporary with them or 3) The European scientists post 1500s.  In all three societies a significant amount of *science* was produced.

And the list is clearly padded.  I mean they dared list ""Paper"" as a Medieval technology????  The Chinese invented that around the year 100 B.C.E. and it was transmitted through the Arabs.

&gt; Because we've been living with it for a thousand years. But shit like the heavy plow and the horse collar were revolutionary. They totally changed the landscape of Europe, allowing for higher population density and better food security.

No, the point is not to compare it with modern developments (obvious straw man), but with developments from similar societies living at the same time, or with the appropriate caveats to adjacent time periods.  At the same time the Arabs had advanced irrigation which made for far superior ""food security"".

&gt; This attitude, full of righteousness, confident in the Justice of it's position, and lacking an adequate background and understanding of the facts and complexities of the case, is  exactly the kind of thing that makes religion so dangerous.

As opposed to your lack of comparative analysis.  You wrote a 1 line reply to me saying ""You are ignorant and speak from a position of ignorance.""  You don't tell me about attitude or full of righteousness.  Its obvious you know absolutely nothing beyond pointing to wikipedia articles.

&gt; Religion is not the belief in gods and demons. It is the adherence to a culturally significant ideology and belief system that defines the nature of the world.

Its also the inability to expand methods of analysis or thinking, inability to produce evidence, or failure to use logic correctly.  (That would be you.)

&gt; Secular Humanism, Progressivism, and other scientifically aligned belief systems strive for a world view in which rational inquiry is paramount [...]

Right.  You *HAVE* to compare the Medieval Europeans to the contemporary Arabs to reach even a minimally acceptable level of rational inquiry.  Did you do this?

&gt; beliefs are second to evidence

Exactly.  You claim the Medieval Europeans engaged in science, so I asked you to produce some examples.  And you failed.  (Technology is a product of science, not science itself)

Also manufacturing things that you claim are evidence (""oh the pope was willing to listen to heliocentrism but Galileo was oh so insulting""), which clearly are not is not the same thing as actual evidence.

&gt; and reality is accepted as being governed by fixed rules which can be revealed and understood through observation and experiment. Key to this system of beliefs is the ability to set aside old ideas in light of new evidence.

Secularism is not a system of belief, but a characteristic of unpious analysis.  There is a crucial difference.

&gt; The ""Dark Ages"" and the bugbear of a deeply technophobic Catholic Church that actively sought to supress scientific progress are just the sort of ideas that need to be set aside.

Based on what?

&gt; These concepts arose out of the deeply flawed and limited historical investigations of the 19th and 20th century.

My analysis includes material from as late as 2006 (pursuing the Arabic angle and seeing how much the European Renaissance was dependent on it).  So I don't know what you are talking about.

&gt; We have much better evidence now. We can now say with confidence that the situation was not simple.

Again, I call bullshit.  Produce a single equation or principle of science that came from the Medieval Europeans.  The fact that they didn't is ridiculously damning.

&gt; The Christian Church of the 4th through 16th centuries was made up of an enormous area covering most of Europe. It included millions of people, dozens of competing ideologies, numerous warring nations, vast cultural and religious syncretism, cultural exchange with Vikings, Rus, Goths, Huns, Muslims, Byzantines, Mongols, and others. What the Church did in Italy in 900ad is vastly different from what was done in central Gaul (Carolingian Renaissance), Ireland (monks preserving ancient texts), North Africa (Yes, there were Christians in Africa) and China (Yes, there were Christians in China. Nestorians, I believe.)
Reducing this vast cultural diaspora, covering three continents, spanning a thousand years, encompassing tens or hundreds of millions of lives, to a mere statement ""Christianity is incompatible with science."" is foolish, shortsighted, dogmatic, and, in light of the available evidence, absolutely false.

You are just arguing by obfuscation.  What *concrete* evidence do you have some kind of enlightened thinking existed anywhere in these Christian regions?  The Christian ideology is *very* particular.  In those times you couldn't be a Christian without submitting to the authority of the church.  Hunting down weasely sounding arguments that don't work doesn't count as learning more about our history.  To be in any way convincing you have to demonstrate some real product of their thinking that shows that they engaged in the kind of free thinking all their immediate geographical and temporal neighbors engaged in.

I'm afraid you don't understand the process of investigation or science at all.

The larvae (Leptocephalus) drift towards Europe in a three-hundred-day migration (FAO data). When approaching the European coast the larvae metamorphose into a transparent larval stage called ""glass eel"", and enter estuaries and start migrating upstream. After entering fresh water, the glass eels metamorphose into elvers, miniature versions of the adult eels. As the eel grows it becomes known as a ""yellow eel"" due to the brownish-yellow color of their sides and belly.

Homosexuality: This is hit on much harder in the Bible, a beast that Mormons enter into a lot more tentatively, well aware of the copious edits and alterings, as well as some just being not inspired by God. I'm comfortable with saying it is, yes, a sin, although nowhere near as much as it's hammered on. I don't see it as any worse than someone with a drinking problem or violent tendencies, it's not a guaranteed hell like it's so often pushed into by people. (Hell being another idea Mormons have a different opinion on.) This is probably the strongest thing that I have against the religion.

**Now the black priesthood ban is a very common misinterpretation.** First of all, it wasn't a sweeping ban against anyone with dark skin, several groups of blacks were holding positions within the church before the ban was removed. (Specifically in India, Philippines, and Aboriginals in Australia) If you look into it it said that the progression from gaining the gospel started with Jews to the Americans then Europeans and obviously the final removal of restrictions there in the 80s.

The reason for the ban is a curse put upon a specific bloodline from ancient times. Only a few specific bloodlines were blessed with being able to hold the priesthood(basically a position of power, the ones who could are typically referred to as ""The 12 Tribes of Israel""). That ban was later removed in the 1980s. Before then that group could still *join* the church I believe, although just not hold any position of power within it. Many were attending sessions and wanted to receive it soon before the ban was removed.

&gt;Thank you for sending in your enquiry about cancer risk and Bisphenol A (BPA). Currently, the evidence that we have on BPA s effects on humans isn t strong enough to say for sure whether it could affect the risk of cancer.
As a precautionary measure, the European Union has recently introduced legislation to ban the use of BPA in babies bottles. Canada had already taken a similar approach. Neither Canada nor the EU have banned the use of BPA in drinking water bottles or similar products.
In the UK the Food Standards Agency is responsible for ensuring the safety of food packaging materials. You can request information by emailing them at this address FoodContactMaterial@foodstandards.gsi.gov.uk
More research is being done into the possible health risks associated with BPA and Cancer Research UK will be interested to see the results. We base the information and advice on our website on the best scientific evidence available and take our responsibility not to cause unnecessary worries very seriously. The webpage you talk about responds to the specific claims in a **common email hoax about plastic containers, which have no scientific basis. For these reasons we say that there is no convincing scientific evidence to suggest that plastic bottles could cause cancer.

While I'm mainly interested in the development of modern Europe from the ashes of the Roman Empire (which is not true at all, Rome actually had a lot of continuity in Late Antiquity as far as government systems go. Hence french is a romance language, not a germanic one). However, I've also studied a bit of Rome (as the entirety of the Middle Ages is an attempt on the part of the ""barbarian"" kingdoms to recapture the glory of Rome). 

Regardless, I think the best part about studying history is the insight you get, and at the same time how one learns to sythesize massive amounts of information, from different sources, into a clear and concise idea. It teaches you to analyze a source, not only for what it says, but who wrote it, under what conditions it was written, etc. You take in many different ideas, and form a new one. Its a bit like a puzzle that you build on your own.

Also, History is the story of the Human Race. *Our* race. These people had the same thoughts, feelings, desires, fears, and needs that we do, just applied to a different schematic. And throughout it all, through all the chaos, people continued to live their day to day lives. 

I think that is heartening, that no matter how bad the world at large is, no matter if x country is about to fall, the common people will find a way to survive.

t1_c2gqag4,0,c2gw3ee,"&gt; I believe that you don't have a mental model of what currency is when there isn't some central authority that say ""this is currency"".

Your explanation is how currency worked a thousand years ago, and of course I agree that currency has its roots in simplifying bartering. But an intermediary for bartering isn't exactly the same thing as a currency, in that gold itself would be devalued if a huge gold meteorite were to crash into Iowa. Or, to reuse a phrase you use later, the big trouble with commodities as currency is that if the gold meteor *doesn't* land, and you hypothetically had economic growth, you'd have the same amount of money chasing a greater number of products: deflation.

That comes up with respect to

&gt; Economic growth requires monetary expansion, so I'm not so sure that's a good idea.

By definition, deflation is things getting less expensive. If there's a fixed amount of money and no credit, then if I start making more goods, my increased production will cause deflation, at the very least in my sector. But why would I possibly do more work for the same amount of money? And indeed, because the same amount of money is going after the increasing number of goods, the goods must (in aggregate) be deflating at the same rate as the rise in the number of goods, negating any possible economic gains from increased production.

&gt; so, not very much? You spent trillions on your military and it still takes ten years to fight what amounts to cavemen and kill their leader? The US military is leading the decline ...

Well, to be fair, neoconservatism is the real problem there. ""Let's liberate Iraq!"" isn't a military objective, so it's not really clear what constitutes success.

It's maybe accurate to say that our military makes a poor occupation force, since we don't do it like the Romans did, so we get the worst of all worlds. But obviously if our objective is to blow shit up, well, we're extremely good at that.

&gt; True. It's the only thing the biggest bully on the block accepts in exchange for protection. What makes the dollar ""immoral"" is that the implied coercion is the only reason it has any value at all.

The government isn't a mafia, it's a public trust. And I don't know about you, but I prefer driving on paved roads.

&gt; It's no accident that sovereign debt start exploding right around the time they got to issue their own money.

Sovereign debt exploded when city-states figured out they could leverage their economies by issuing public bonds. Potato, potato, I know, but it's a good distinction. Primarily because bonds are fiat, while commodity currency is not. And like any fiat system, whether it works or crashes is based on whether it's managed well. But the same could be said of any economy, so there's that.

&gt; But even the dullest bulb will not play the debasement game forever.

""Debasement"" only makes sense if the dollar is tied to something. But this seems as good a time as any to talk about inflation, which is interesting, since you provided a perfectly serviceable definition of inflation:

&gt; Increase in the money supply have to go somewhere. The blister in prices that results from more money chasing the same resources is that bubble.

Yes, the additional money has to go somewhere. If it goes under mattresses or gets burned, then nothing happens. If it goes into economic growth, then more goods become available to soak up the extra money, and the value of the currency is relatively unchanged. It's only if additional growth is impossible that monetary expansion causes inflation.

But a bubble is an artificially high valuation of some products or sectors. The only way that bubbles are connected to the availability of money or credit is that they need money to be fueled, but excess money (past what economic growth can handle) is inflationary, not bubbly. You also need some sort of bizarre fad among investors or creditors to actually fuel a bubble: everyone needs to think that tech stocks are hot shit and will grow endlessly, even if they grow well past the (shaky) fundamentals of the underlying company. Or they need to think that mortgage-backed securities with AAA ratings are safe investment vehicles, in order to prop up a housing price bubble.

&gt; That's as wrong as it gets but I really don't have any interest in convincing you. Everyone who wants to know can know what happened in Zimbabwe and in Germany was out-of-control ""monetary easing"" aka printing.

What happened in Zimbabwe is that Mugabe is a racist dick. As soon as he took power, he kicked out all the white landowners and gave the extremely arable land to political cronies who weren't interested in farming. Even if there weren't monetary expansion, there would be the same amount of money chasing after fewer goods, i.e., inflation. But since Mugabe is an even bigger moron, he thought the solution was issuing more currency, which made more money chasing after the same fewer goods. But the core problem was the crop supply shock; the expansion happened later.

The same is roughly true of post-Versailles Germany. The Allied powers didn't want Germany to ever be able to remilitarize, so they screwed up the industrial base of the country, while extracting whatever real output there was to pay back unrealistic reparations.

The same is roughly true of ""stagflation"" in the 70s. The Middle East was tired of being a bunch of oil-exporting colony states, so they formed OPEC and established production quotas. Oil drives industry, so industry ground to a halt. Instant supply shock.

&gt; Oh goody, someone who thinks the hard part of economic activity is consuming.

It is the hard part when energy is cheap and the wealthy control the government.

I'd talk about debt, recession, and the current accounts deficit, but I have a party to get to.

Secondly, in regards to Taiwan the people there can choose, as far as I am concerned, how they want to live. Whether or not it is part of China as you say is more a matter of is China willing to exert its control over it or not. If they are not then it is not part of China. Plain and simple.

In regards to"" trying to whip up china as a threat"" that is just silly. I was using it as an example.

Men were seen to have inherent worth and status that women were not, and so did not have to bring forth anywhere near as great a marriage gift.

&gt; Child marriages to boys or girls?

The average age that a man married in the Middle Ages was from 25-40; the average age that a ""woman"" married was 12-18, quite clearly in order to inculcate the husband's values on the impressionable girl.

t1_c2gvnfw,0,c2gwjpd,"That's not entirely reasonable. I'll note that the Church really only began holding back natural philosophy once it started to directly challenge the Bible; the Medieval and Renaissance Papacy was one of the continent's chief beneficiaries of art and scholarly thought. It wasn't much for heresy, but ""heresy"" tended to be equally as insane as orthodoxy, if not more so, so that's a wash. I'll agree that the active interference of the Church *slowed* the spread of science in Europe, but the censorship of the Church cannot really be pointed to as a special case preventing science from being thought of. Moreover, society didn't get a whole lot more secular during the Reformation that preceded the flowering of science. If anything, it got significantly more pious; the chief complaint of most reformers was that the Church was too worldly and not devout enough.

Now, I will agree that the existence of a pre-existing world philosophy, Church or otherwise, did hold back science quite a bit. Science requires that all pre-existing conceptions of how things work be expendable, and people naturally want to fit what they learn in with what they already ""know."" However, people are always going to want to do that, whether or not there's one political-religious entity like the Church burning heretics.

Look at China. China more or less lacked state-backed organized religion throughout most of its history, dalliances with Buddhism aside. Chinese thinkers were usually free so long as they did not directly challenge the Emperor's legitimacy. And there was certainly nothing to prevent science from coming up. China was for most of its history wealthier, more literate, more educated, more centralized, more supportive of the arts, and more technologically advanced than Europe. But yet they didn't develop science proper. In lieu of a Church, China developed an enormous respect for tradition. This respect, while rarely (if ever) forcing freethinkers to recant, ensured that new discoveries would be cataloged alongside ancient nonsense instead of supplanting it.

I do think that the Reformation was, in a way, responsible for science--odd, considering that the early Protestants were thoroughly Medieval in mindset. The hows and whys aren't necessary in this post, given that I veer towards verbosity as it stands. But I also think that the Reformation was a unique event in history when considering all the political, philosophical, and religious factors.

This is where a vast amount of different hypotheses exist, and nothing actually is known. It's also where you want to place god.

That's where you're wrong. According to Steven Hawking, ""almost everyone now believes that the universe, and time itself, had a beginning at the big bang."" Once again, the singularity marks the edge of space time. Hawking says this is the consensus. Stop trying to muddle the waters.

&gt;You brag that your dogma accepts evolution, even though that's only a very recent development and it took many years for the church to change it's stance to the long existing scientific consensus that evolution is a fact. Before that, evolution was not accepted by catholic dogma.

Wrong. At least since the time of St. Augustine, the Church has been open to a naturalistic explanation of creation, taking Genesis in a more symbolic light. In 1950, Pope Pius XII emphasized that the Church does not condemn discussion about evolution. John Paul II called evolution ""more than a hypothesis"", and Cardinal Ratzinger, who is now pope, endorsed a statement from the Pontifical Academy of Sciences stating that evolution is accepted as a fact. The Church has always been open to such an interpretation, and there was no reluctance.

&gt;You also seem to forget about the whole mess with Galilei

If you study the case of Galileo, you will see that the Church didn't necessarily oppose him because of his discoveries. Galileo always pushed the envelope. At the time, it was widely thought that the earth stood in place by scientists of the day. Galileo's claims were controversial because he could not address a problem regarding stellar parallax. The pope basically told him to wait until further evidence on the matter could come forth, so Galileo published a work that basically called the pope an idiot. He also continued to push his then controversial ideas. Until then, the pope was pretty much Galileo's only friend in the matter, and Galileo ensured that ended.

&gt;Even when Pope Benedict XIV finally allowed his work to be published it still had to be censored

The only thing that was censored was the _Dialogue_, which is the work I mentioned calling the pope an idiot. Even then, it was only mildly censored for prudent reasons, not to cover up science.

&gt;I've heard about the catholic church starting universities so often. Every catholic always leaves out that they were highly censored.

t1_c2gusth,0,c2gws5s,"&gt;and if you're fighting near a planet (which is most likely)

You seem to be making a few assumptions yourself. For the sake of argument, why would space battles necessarily happen near planets?

I mean, any space battle that is likely to ever happen is going to happen entirely within our solar system (as faster than light travel is pure fantasy).

There are really only 2 worlds that are ever likely to be habitable in this system (Earth and Mars).

I suppose there are other potential destinations, Jupter's moons, asteroids, artificial habitats in Lagrangian points, but it would follow that the bulk of travel, commerce, and interaction would be between the two most densely populated regions.

You can't hide ships in space, so you can see when Mars has a revolution and sends a fleet your way. Why would you wait for them to get to Earth? You launch as soon as you are aware of their approach.

The fleets meet somewhere in the middle at very high velocity to the extent that they would pass right by each other in a matter of seconds.

As they pass they exchange fire, throw a lot of debris in their enemy's path, fire as many lasers, guided missiles, and nukes as they can and hope that they win.

That's of course assuming symmetrical warfare, which is far from assured.

Mars being a colony dependent on Earth in a way no European colony ever was. Even if thermoforming (taking thousands of years) is successful, the planet would simply lack the biodeversity, labour force, and industrial infrastructure necessary to compete with the well-established Earth. It's not like the Americas where there was an abundance of natural resources to fuel their revolution.

Personally I lean more towards highly asymmetrical warfare, between major powers or corporations and small groups, revolutionaries, terrorists, who, much like the September 11th hijackers, take full advantage of the dissemination and democratization of technologies. Just one example: 3D printers get better, eventually allow you to replicate most technologies in your basement.

If you thought we had a problem with kids building nukes out of old smoke detectors, imagine what it would be like in a future where technology has become even more dispersed.

Battles probably wouldn't be between fleets of ships, and I wonder if warships would even make sense in that context, at least our current thinking of what constitutes a warship.

They'd probably be entirely automated (just look at how quickly drones are taking over the air supremacy role in Afghanistan), with maybe a small command ship safely in back a few light seconds away with human minds watching over everything.

Of course it depends on your goal. A terrorist group, if they want to cause as much havoc as possible, the easiest way to do that is drop an asteroid on Earth or Mars. They don't need any warships, just some tugs.

If you're thinking of conflict between more political bodies, then you probably value Earth/Mars and don't want to destroy them, so the fighting is a little more restrained.

You rig up a way to throw rocks at relativistic velocities from far away. Far enough away that the only defense is to randomly move your ships; because you're engaging tens of lightseconds apart, they can't aim directly at the light of your ship because that information is already out of date.

Just offering an alternate point of view, a couple of different scenarios.

&gt;Source: [2] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks#Founding

Right after this quote and citation you made from wikipedia is the following:

&gt;It has been represented in public since January 2007 by Julian Assange and others. Assange describes himself as a member of WikiLeaks' advisory board.[20] News reports in The Australian have called Assange the ""founder of WikiLeaks"".[21] According to Wired magazine, a volunteer said that Assange described himself in a private conversation as ""the heart and soul of this organisation, its founder, philosopher, spokesperson, original coder, organiser, financier, and all the rest"".[22] As of June 2009, the site had over 1,200 registered volunteers[7] and listed an advisory board comprising Assange and eight other people.[23]

which contradicts your interpretation of your first source before you cited wikileaks:
&gt;Daniel Domscheit-Berg and Julian Assagne first presented the idea of Wikileaks at the Chaos Communications Congress. They were there together, announcing the start of the project.

&gt;&gt;Beginning at the Chaos Communications Congress of December 2009, where WikiLeaks‚Äô Julian Assange and Daniel Domscheit-Berg first presented their world-changing plans to a select audience of the planet‚Äôs most skilful and motivated hackers.

The start of the project could not have been in 2009 if wikileaks.org was registered in 2006 and assange acted as spokesperson since early 2007.

I've known guys on private servers that will just chain run raids with hour long lockouts.  One after another after another.

And I'm going to answer these a little out of order...

Private servers vary GREATLY between servers in ALL aspects.

As for money; I've seen some that had $300 custom sets for Donors (this was that Private server that the owner got sued for multiple millions) that people were very willing to pay for, and others that took donations but would only give out current tier gear, and others that didn't give out anything.
Other than donations, they do not cost anything, and donations are optional most of the time.

Worth playing also depends a lot upon the server.  Some are completely custom, I've been on some that are pure PVP with very well made custom BGs and Arenas, others are completely horrible and not worth playing.  All private servers have bugs though, none are 100% working, some get close, but none are perfect.
Almost all private servers are running on previous patches, there are a few on Cata, but they are not running well at all, many bugs, crashes and other issues.  
There are some that run Vanilla and TBC content as well, which can be good for those who truly liked those eras.

Population varies greatly upon the server, some servers have a community similar to Vanilla WoW where people know the good players and the good guilds.  I've been on others that had over hour long queues to get into them because of the amount of players though.

One thing to note about Private servers is the majority of players are Eastern European and South American.  I have not been on a single server that didn't have a strong Ukrainian/Russian/Iranian/Brazilian/Mexican presence.

The flow also depends on the server.  Most servers do focus on getting things faster than retail.  When looking at servers all of them will have x1, x3, x12, x40, etc.  These are the popular rates that are often seen, basically it means everything is done X times faster, so you'll gain 3 times experience, whatever.  There are often bugs in raids and servers will often advertise the fact that they have working raids that are properly scripted.  Lockouts are also quite a bit shorter.  At one point I was in a guild on a private server where we were raiding ToC 25H twice a day, as well as running countless 10H's for emblems.  I would argue that it was even tougher than retail at that point due to many bugs, Faction Champs required around 6-8 tanks for example due to them oneshotting anything else.  Servers vary from having things similar to Blizzard to others where the developers throw random spells on bosses so that they were completely different, and other servers where the bosses did nothing and were tank and spank.

And yes, they are against Blizzard's ToS.  They haven't shut down private servers since the great purge of 2009(maybe 2008?) where many of the top servers were shut down.  But much like pirating music, if one site is shut down the players and the developers flow to another.",3,True,1314931627,alliance-warrior,3,,True,ArtfullyUseless,0,,1427548687,t1_c2gwvgx,0,t3_k1ylb,wow,t5_2qio8,False
t1_c2gwqdx,0,c2gwwld,"I should start by saying that I completely agree that a powerful religion can--and in our single case study did--slow the spread and development of science. Agreed there. The Church definitely did not speed science along, nor did it sit idly by. But when we discuss why scientific thought (which I'll date to Copernicus and Vesalius by convention) only arose relatively recently, I don't think the Church is the main reason why. A force hindering its growth? Yes. A force preventing its creation? Not exactly.

I don't think the development of science is more likely under a nonreligious society. By my understanding, science itself does not seem to require much as a strict prerequisite to be invented: it needs empirical thought, it needs rationalism, and it needs experimentation. Accurate measuring tools of some sort and a system of mathematical reckoning are probably also necessary.

Those conditions are pretty easy to meet. There have been many societies of varying degrees of religiosity in human history; most since antiquity have had all of those preconditions. Yet most societies didn't invent science; they just had philosophers who looked at the world and philosophers who thought about the world and they were on equal footing. We can look back at old star charts and astronomical predictions and say, ""look, here is science,"" but keep in mind that those were used purely for astrology. They were used to support a superstitious worldview, not to build a new worldview on the basis of the evidence.

And that's what I'm trying to say, I think. The biggest impediment to science is not a malign church censoring thought; it is the human tendency to believe that what you already think is true regardless of what you learn. When people discover things that conflict with their worldview, their natural inclination is not to go back and make a new worldview, their inclination is to make it somehow fit together and go merrily on with their lives. Tradition, religion, and other forces of social conservatism certainly support this process, but aren't the only things driving it.

So why didn't science emerge except in Europe in the 16th-19th centuries? I think the answer is because science is not something humans naturally come up with under most circumstances. Why did it at all? I think the Reformation created the perfect political and philosophical environment in which science could have been created.

Who knows, maybe technological progress sparked by state competition would have eventually created such a critical mass of data that science was inevitable. I might well be wrong.

European governments worked very hard to try and kill this research that would undermine the profitable and politically popular AGW theory. If you are interested in AGW, you probably did not hear about this theory. It is not surprising if that is the case. 

2. In 09 the CRU was busted for fudging their data - which they referred to as ""hiding the decline"" in order to create a temperature graph that was more amenable to their position than would be provided by using actual temperature data. Than they lied about it and tried to cover it up. It came out in a series of leaked emails.

1. Christian domination was not the cause of the Dark Ages; it was a response to the complete collapse of all society and order with the decline and fall of Roman power. For economic and political reasons, Europe went from being citizens of a lawful, centralized government that maintained public works to being subjects of illiterate local warlords obeying no law but brutal force. There was a social vacuum, which the Church filled. I think it did a pretty good job of doing that for the first 700 years or so, but that's a discussion for another time.

2. The Roman empire wasn't really doing science. It did technology all right, but most Roman technology wasn't lost in the West--and nothing was lost in the East, which continued all the splendor, intrigue, art, philosophy, and militarism of the Roman Empire until 1453. The Byzantine Empire as we now call it (they just called it Rome) was enormously wealthy, enormously cultured, and supported art and thought while Western Europe stagnated in petty wars. It likely spent more on intellectual development and stimulation than any civilization short of China. However, it produced virtually no science, no art, no literature, and no philosophy that we care about today. It did little but rehash past glories in thought and in art, and devoted what creative energy it had to bickering incredibly pointless, tedious, and obscure points of metaphysical philosophy. It is impossible to read about Byzantine history and not marvel that the most splendid empire on Earth was torn apart several times, with riots and mass revolts, over the finer distinctions of ""depiction,"" ""veneration,"" and ""worship"" as regards icons.

I think the issue is far more politically charged than linguistic - cultural relativists who are reluctant to admit that one thing is better than another versus more absolutist leaning people who believe in immutable standards by which to measure human actions. 

I don't necessarily think that the second group's ""immutable standards"" are necessarily derived from religion, although in most cases it seems this way. I, for example, believe that we are ingrained with a certain social moral code that has evolved in humans to facilitate social living - there are huge benefits to being able to effectively participate in society. 

I would view this case through the lens of social interaction. A language should be standardized to enable effective communication. Does one word or phrase mean the same thing to one person as it does to another? I haven't studied AAVE or linguistics so I don't really know. 

From what I can tell, AAVE does not really add anything of much value, it's more a standardization of misuse of English. Just from looking over Wikipedia it looks like the dialect provides for less accuracy than standard English, for example the following table:


Phase	Example
Past	Pre-recent	I been flown it
Recent	I done fly ita
Pre-present	I did fly it
Past Inceptive	I do fly it
Present	I be flying it
Future	Immediate	I'm a-fly it
Post-immediate	I'm a-gonna fly it
Indefinite future	I gonna fly it

AAVE seems mostly to be the product of lack of education. It's called ""African American,"" but it's obviously only spoken by those on the lowest rungs of the socioeconomic ladder. Middle class African Americans don't speak AAVE. If this is the case then I think we are doing a disservice to young AAVE speakers to encourage it. 

Just like languages adapt and are assimilated by the prevailing forces, so too are cultures and customs. In this case I would argue that AAVE is a relic of inequalities in opportunity and education between African Americans and Northern Europeans on the American continent. Let it die. Don't perpetuate it. 

But I think it's good that people are out there opposing this view. There's a healthy medium. I'm sure you wouldn't argue that words should mean whatever we want them to mean, right? That defeats the purpose of language. On the other hand trying to resist the natural evolution of language is ultimately futile. I think it's a fight worth fighting when it's a matter of preserving accuracy. For example, the word ""literally"" in popular usage recently has almost completely lost its meaning in the sense of something being literal vs metaphorical. Would you argue that this is just a natural evolution and we should allow it to happen?

The assumption that one has a claim on another's wealth, life, security, rights, and so on, is inculcated from birth.  ""Fuck your dreams.  Fuck what you want.  I want something and I'm going to buy it with the money you saved up for your dreams.""

And as such I wonder what the point of arguing anymore is.  I don't know where you guys are from but I'm in the United States.  And I have to feel that if the war is lost here, and I believe it is - there's not much hope for Europe and the Commonwealth either.

This is not a libertarian world (substitute whatever you want for libertarian, I'm using it generally for the spectrum of individualist worldviews, including anarchism).  People don't want liberty.

They want free shit.  They want what they want, at *your* cost.  They want government as daddy protecting them from monsters under the bed, no matter what it costs.   

You can win an intellectual argument here or there, but generally speaking, the number of people who aren't basically thieving little weasels in this society is miniscule.  Shit, what can you even say to the progressive critics of the Tea Party when the point out the amount of Medicare and so on that the same ""anti-government"" people spend all their time ranting against?  All you can do is acknowledge the hypocrisy of the loudest and most visible advocates of smaller government.

At this point, I have to believe the only realistic option for liberty in my lifetime is the Free State Project.  I slagged it for awhile.  It has nutjobs, excesses, stupidity -- all of the things every movement everywhere has.

But it has become clear to me as I approach 40, in my 21st year of anti-statism, that the only way to win this war is to make it impossible for these leeches to do what it is they want to do.  I don't mean persuade them.  And as anarchists, I know you know what I mean when I say battling them at the voting booth is pointless.  Look at the current state of the Libertarian Party.

We have to build it.  That is the only way.  We need a fortress of liberty.  Of people who don't argue with our aggressors, but simply stand up to them and make the world they want impossible, at least in our neck of the woods.  We need to outnumber statists.

I envy those of you - and there are many, and I salute you - who participated in that discussion.  But it seems so fucking futile at this point.

This is not a libertarian country, and freedom is merely an abstract, formless abstraction to which people pay lip service - I especially include, and deride, conservatives here.

Because at least progressives don't pretend to give a shit about individuals.  Conservatives are the worst because they hijack the idiom of freedom, and adulterate it with terrible hypocrisy.

Atheists generally don't evangelize. Many can defend their position with a reasonable answer if confronted about it, but there's no motivation to go door to door handing out biology and physics text books that describe a universe that doesn't require any gods or magic to operate the way it does.

Personally, I don't believe in any gods because I've never seen a valid case made for their existence, and more specifically, the history of the Abrahamic religions is well recorded as having come from the same sorts of tribal mythologies as every other forgotten religion.

I'll attempt to very briefly paint the broad strokes of the history of your god.

Around 1200BC, virtually every tribe and city around the Mediterranean had it's own religion; people worshiped regional gods inspired by stories from previous generations and travelers, every generation traditions were lost and founded, ideas that became popular or served a purpose lasted longer than hair brained ideas, but it was generally a time of the exploration of mysticism. People didn't understand what governed the phenomena around them, the tides, the wind, or where it all came from.

A tribe from northern Egypt and Jordan, known as the Kenites worshiped a god called Yahweh. The Cannanite people too, had a god of this name within their Pantheon, which was headed by a high-god named El. In different regions Yahweh was known as the storm god, a mountain god, or a warrior god - this is the nature of belief at this time, every tribe and generation changed their ideas as per the opinion of their priests and holy men. 

From within Canaan, the Israelite and Judean cultures arose, and of the myriad of local folk lore, the Israelite people took Yahweh as their primary god, while the people of Judea worshipped El. Long story short, these two cultures melded into the ancestors of what we know today as the Jewish people, which necessitated a merger of their two religions, and a problem arose with who exactly their high god now was. Within this group were monotheists, polytheists, and everything in between. The new ""truth"" of the gods was decided by the priests with the loudest voices and most compelling arguments. God is known by many names in their writings, because the writers come from different beliefs, and the ideas of Yahweh and El are merged into a single entity. The Torah and other Jewish scriptures are the result of this need to formalize beliefs in a complex society, and would later be translated to become the Old Testiment of the Bible. They included mythology from the various cultural roots of the Israelite and Judean people, and because it was of various sources, there was contradiction and difference of opinion.

These people lived in country that was largely desert, and very difficult to prosper in without strict rules governing the behavior of the population, so religion grabbed a fast hold. What they did have going for them however was trade, they were the crossroads between europe, turkey, asia, and north africa. Culturally, they lived in the center of the world. Because of this, philosophy from the area quickly made it's way to Greece and Rome. This is the status quo for a few hundred years, the Jewish people flourish and develop a rich culture, based on strict adherence to their moral code.

Fast forward to the first century AD, and fringe groups begin to form within the Jewish faith, like the Nazarene, Jewish people who believe in a much more progressive world view. History and mythology are difficult to determine from each other at this point, but given Jewish and Roman records, one can draw a reasonable conclusion that a Nazarene man named Yeshua was executed under Pontius Pilate in Jerusalem for apostasy. Over the following century, the Nazarene and other religions consider Yeshua as a martyr for their cause, and tales of his life are created to paint him as a prodigal messiah. It's notable that by and large Jewish people did not accept him as the messiah, because he did was not recorded to have fulfilled any prophecies, to them he was just one of of numerous false messiahs.

Regardless, to the many cults that had grown to worship him, he was the real deal. 

A Jewish man named Saul was enraptured by the stories of the messiah, and the promise of eternal life in heaven, and began to compile and perpetuate the many varied and conflicting reports of Yeshua's life, writing much recorded missionary testimony to the various as-yet ununified messiah cults. Along with the tales and stories he learned, he perpetuated his own personal morality, often presenting it as the will of the messiah himself. These letters are the majority of what would become the New Testiment of the Bible. The messiah cult became an organised movement, and grew over the following centuries, despite the opposition of Roman rule. It appealed to the people, due to the promise of heaven, and they feared to turn from it, afraid of eternal damnation.

As the cult grew to Greece, it gained the name Khristos, meaning messiah, and in English is read as Christ. 

Fast forward again to the 4th century, at the battle of the Milvian Bridge, Constantine I adorned the shields of his men with a design of the crucifix, because of a dream he had, and won the battle despite the odds. From that day, Constantine converted to Christianity as thanks to the god who favored him in that battle, as did eventually the official religion of the roman empire. He developed the Edict of Milan, proclaiming Christians the right to practice their religion, in spite of the traditional roman religion. At the first Council of Nicaea he compiled what he saw fit as the proper collection of scriptures, with additions by his scribes, and entire books omitted at his whim. Roman and Christian mythology was married in a compromise that suited Constantine. Latin translations of this first truly modern Bible were commissioned. By this stage, Yeshua the Nazarene was translated to Jesus of Nazareth, a place that until Constantine, only existed on paper. There is no record of Nazareth prior to this translation.

The rest is largely history. The pope was installed in Rome and the Holy Roman Empire ruled Europe by the sword and cross. Much of Europe was given the choice to either convert to Christianity or die, so the many pagan traditions all but died out. Many crusades were launched from Rome to take Jerusalem in the name of the Holy Empire, countless Muslims were slain. Roman occupation of Briton installed Christianity as a religion there, and when the British Empire began to grow, so did Christianity once again, eventually on to America, where it is still clung to, for the promise of eternal life in heaven, and the fear of damnation.

t1_c2gx831,0,c2gxsk6,"&gt; Conceding one word breaches the integrity of the language. If ""you has"" becomes acceptable instead of ""you have,"" then where do you draw the line? Where is the line between English and not-English?

Why should you draw a line? Language changes. It's a fact. Some organisations, like L'Academie Francaise, attempt to regulate change. They're able to slow change, but change will happen despite a regulatory organisation. Besides, I would venture to say that there is no clearly defined line. Language is such a complex thing that it's impossible to change just one thing and make it a different thing.

&gt;I would view this case through the lens of social interaction. A language should be standardized to enable effective communication. Does one word or phrase mean the same thing to one person as it does to another? I haven't studied AAVE or linguistics so I don't really know.

Language doesn't need to be perfectly standardised, but it does need a modicum of standardisation in order to facilitate effective communication between speakers. Assuming you're an American or have watched some measure of American television, then you understand that ""you has"" means ""you have."" The only difference between the two is that the one is a different conjugation of the other. It's true that some things don't mean the same thing to others, but if people weren't able to explain such differences, how could you spread change? How would any slang spread?

&gt;From what I can tell, AAVE does not really add anything of much value, it's more a standardization of misuse of English.

On the contrary, it's not a misuse, it's sufficiently different to be called a separate dialect. It has grammatical and phonological rules that are quite different from those of Standard American English. What you call ""misuse"" is called in linguistics ""prescriptivism."" Linguistics is the study of language as it is, not as it should be. Thus, it's ""descriptive,"" not ""prescriptive."" Linguistic regulatory organisations prescribe, but in the end prescriptivism can only delay language change.

&gt;AAVE seems mostly to be the product of lack of education. It's called ""African American,"" but it's obviously only spoken by those on the lowest rungs of the socioeconomic ladder. Middle class African Americans don't speak AAVE. If this is the case then I think we are doing a disservice to young AAVE speakers to encourage it.

If AAVE is the product of education, it's because the language of education is Standard American English. You don't call a Native American/First Nations language part of the lower class simply because the language of education in North America is English in one form or another. In any society in which a diglossic situation exists, there's one prestige language spoken by the upper class (Standard American English--SAE, in this case,) and another language spoken by lower classes (AAVE). What it comes down to is that SAE is the standard language of the US and AAVE isn't.

&gt;Just like languages adapt and are assimilated by the prevailing forces, so too are cultures and customs. In this case I would argue that AAVE is a relic of inequalities in opportunity and education between African Americans and Northern Europeans on the American continent. Let it die. Don't perpetuate it.

This might be a relic of the oppression of Africans by Europeans in the New World, but Ebonics no longer means that. It's an inextricable part of the culture. To them, it doesn't represent the past wrongs committed against them, it's simply the language they speak, the way they've learned it. English is littered with French borrowings, yet English speakers don't look back at the time of French dominance with a leery eye. It happened, and now it's gone.

&gt;For example, the word ""literally"" in popular usage recently has almost completely lost its meaning in the sense of something being literal vs metaphorical. Would you argue that this is just a natural evolution and we should allow it to happen?

This is a good example. Certainly, many people of the youngest generation use it as a word meaning ""incredibly"" or ""truly"". Perhaps in the next 30 or 50 years, this word will come to take on that meaning IN ADDITION to the meaning it has now. Perhaps later, some other word will replace it in either (or maybe both) the former or the latter meaning. As I've been saying, language evolves. While even linguists as people might feel that such a change should NOT happen, as professionals, they observe with interest. I think that evolution should not be prevented.

Certainly, I agree that there's some good in regulation of language change, to ensure that language doesn't change so quickly that people of different generations have difficulty understanding each other. With globalisation, this has been achieved. No longer do we have villages that are isolated from others, which in the past were incubators for dialects that were markedly different from their neighbours mere kilometers away. The advent of modern technologies of mass communication, telephone, and other speech communication has meant that language will become increasingly standardised. But this change will happen slowly. So slowly that it's nearly imperceptible over a lifetime save for small changes like the common young generation's usage of ""literally"" in a context that is somewhat different from how standard English uses it. In short, the larger the community, the more slowed a change is.

He did so without authorization from congress under questionable pretenses (there was never a risk to the US), and he exceeded the time window he had to seek authorization from Congress. [Even Holder said it was illegal.](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43474045/ns/politics-white_house/t/libya-president-obama-evaded-rules-legal-disputes-scholars-say/#.TmBgz3BOlNA) There are plenty of us who oppose US war policy for Obama to completely subvert the mandated means of authorization is chilling.

&gt; If Kucinich wanted reliable information, the last place he would have gone was the Gaddafi regime. And the bombs the US dropped saved a lot more people than they killed.

Who said he thought he was getting reliable intel? If he was doing his own investigation, that seems like a perfectly valid thing to do. Were I Kucinich, I wouldn't trust US official intel, so it seems like a valid action to me. 

Regardless of what would have happened without US intervention, I don't think it is the business of the US to police the world. Maybe I just think that bombs are a pretty bad means of diplomacy. Plenty of bad shit happens in the world that the US does nothing about; I personally think that there is a time to intervene, but I think rapid action is rarely the best policy.

&gt;  So it's OK for private corporations to side with dictators against their own country, as long as the goal is oil profits. But if the American government supports a popular uprising against a bloodthirsty dictator, that's an atrocity.

No, they are all equally assholes. Don't forget that the US and Europe did plenty to keep Gaddafi around before. I'm just saying it is wrong to scapegoat when the blame should be shared all around.

t3_k21sr,0,c2gy1fn,"OK.  As near as I can tell, here's what happened.

FIRST, realize that plenty of gun-grabbers are simply ""hardcore statists"" who hold those opinions because they believe that their university-degreed butts are necessary to make decisions for ""the rabble"" who need to be controlled.  They don't actually believe in gun control as a crime-reduction measure.  I strongly suspect Dianne Feinstein of this, and God only knows how many more.

But there's also ""true believers"" in gun control, or the movement would have collapsed long ago.  And I think I understand what's going on there.

Starting in the 1960s the Dems became the party that talked more about racial equality.  They became linked in most people's mind to ""championing the plight of the black and brown"".  There's a bunch of reasons for this - Cesar Chavez and the farm union movement brought a lot of Latinos into the party, and Dr. King himself was there at the start of the black/Dem alliance.

Understand: I'm not saying any of this was a bad thing.  A lot of it was necessary.

But they ran into a problem.  How do you talk about the insanely high levels of black inner-city violence?  Again, not just ""what do you do about it?"" but *how do you even talk about it* without pissing off that voting block?

First, understand how serious the problem is.  Any given year about 55% of the murders committed in the US are committed by blacks.  (And of course most of those against blacks.)  And they only make up 15% of the US population.  If those murders were excluded from the US per-capita murder rates, our murder rate would drop to middle-of-the European-spectrum levels, supporting the idea that ""the violence isn't because of our guns"".

These black inner-city murder rates are an enormous problem for everybody.  ""Something needs to be done"" - but the Dems had painted themselves into a major ideological trap by preaching ""multiculturalism"" for years, embedding the very concepts deep into the school systems via the teacher's unions and the like.

The plain fact is, not all ""cultures"" are equal.  Some are more violent than others.  Some are less economically productive than others.  Some treat women like dirt (Arab culture in particular which isn't the same as ""Islam"").  The general US ""culture"" is frackin' insane where credit and debt are concerned!

The inner-city ""black hip-hop subculture"" (which obviously includes some whites - hi Marshall Mathers!) is by far the most violent culture in the US and is among the most violent in the world.  It did NOT get that way because of anybody's genetics!  Rather, it's the product of years of systematic destruction of the African-American family structure:

* Slavery didn't exactly help form stable families.

* Neither did job and housing discrimination that separated black men from their families and crashed their income levels.

* Or welfare laws that severely penalized any mother who had a guy anywhere near her life.

* Police racism and abuse made sure that problems got solved ""in the hood"" in an extra-legal fashion.

* Strict gun control laws made sure that black criminals had easy access to nearby unarmed prey, and as long as that prey was also black the cops didn't care.

* The ""War On (Some) Drugs"" was systematically rigged against minorities, proving to them (correctly, unfortunately) that they were despised by the powers that be.

OK, so all of this contributed to insane murder rates.  And it needs to be fixed at a cultural level, which is hard AND which can make a politican appear racist as hell.

Since a large chunk of the murders are in fact gunfire, blaming the guns starts to look like a viable alternative to actually fixing the culture.  And the ""blame the guns"" mantra plays well with that audience.  This is why, in 2000-2001, the NAACP strongly defended the Michigans bans on concealed carry without a hard-as-hell-to-get permit, never mind that the same law they were defending had been passed in 1926 at the specific request of the KKK after the Sweet family shooting and self defense aquittal.

Another interesting bit: go study Latino murder rates.  You'll find that stereotypes aside they're nowhere near black murder rates except in a few festering ""barrios"" in places like Los Angeles which were influenced by black culture and the ""drug war"" (gangs, etc.).  Overall, Latino family structures are in much, much better shape even when the income levels are on a par with the worst-off black areas, and it shows in the violence levels.  (Here in Tucson AZ, from what I can tell Latino family structures are in better shape than most white families, even when they're split by the US/Mexican border.)

Published August 31, 2011

**The mysterious substance known as dark matter may actually be an illusion created by gravitational interactions between short-lived particles of matter and antimatter, a new study says.
**

Dark matter is thought to be an invisible substance that makes up almost a quarter of the mass in the universe. The concept was first proposed in 1933 to explain why the outer galaxies in galaxy clusters orbit faster than they should, based on the galaxies' visible mass.

At the observed speeds, the outer galaxies should be flung out into space, since the clusters don't appear to have enough mass to keep the galaxies at their edges gravitationally bound.

So physicists proposed that the galaxies are surrounded by halos of invisible matter. This dark matter provides the extra mass, which in turn creates gravitational fields strong enough to hold the clusters together.

In the new study, physicist Dragan Hajdukovic at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Switzerland proposes an alternative explanation, based on something he calls the ""gravitational polarization of the quantum vacuum.""

**Empty Space Filled With ""Virtual"" Particles**

The quantum vacuum is the name physicists give to what we see as empty space.

According to quantum physics, empty space is not actually barren but is a boiling sea of so-called virtual particles and antiparticles constantly popping in and out of existence.

Antimatter particles are mirror opposites of normal matter particles. For example, an antiproton is a negatively charged version of the positively charged proton, one of the basic constituents of the atom.

When matter and antimatter collide, they annihilate in a flash of energy. The virtual particles spontaneously created in the quantum vacuum appear and then disappear so quickly that they can't be directly observed.

In his new mathematical model, Hajdukovic investigates what would happen if virtual matter and virtual antimatter were not only electrical opposites but also gravitational opposites‚Äîan idea some physicists previously proposed.

""Mainstream physics assumes that there is only one gravitational charge, while I have assumed that there are two gravitational charges,"" Hajdukovic said.

According to his idea, outlined in the current issue of the journal Astrophysics and Space Science, matter has a positive gravitational charge and antimatter a negative one.

That would mean matter and antimatter are gravitationally repulsive, so that an object made of antimatter would ""fall up"" in the gravitational field of Earth, which is composed of normal matter.

Particles and antiparticles could still collide, however, since gravitational repulsion is much weaker than electrical attraction.

**How Galaxies Could Get Gravity Boost**

While the idea of particle antigravity might seem exotic, Hajdukovic says his theory is based on well-established tenants in quantum physics.

For example, it's long been known that particles can team up to create a so-called electric dipole, with positively charge particles at one end and negatively charged particles at the other.

According to theory, there are countless electric dipoles created by virtual particles in any given volume of the quantum vacuum.

All of these electric dipoles are randomly oriented‚Äîlike countless compass needles pointing every which way. But if the dipoles form in the presence of an existing electric field, they immediately align along the same direction as the field.

According to quantum field theory, this sudden snapping to order of electric dipoles, called polarization, generates a secondary electric field that combines with and strengthens the first field.

Hajdukovic suggests that a similar phenomenon happens with gravity. If virtual matter and antimatter particles have different gravitational charges, then randomly oriented gravitational dipoles would be generated in space.

If these gravitational dipoles form near a galaxy‚Äîa massive object that would have a strong gravitational field‚Äîthe dipoles should become polarized.

This polarization would generate a secondary gravitational field that would combine with and strengthen the galaxy's gravitational field.

""My theory makes the gravitational field of a galaxy stronger‚Äîwithout dark matter,"" Hajdukovic said.

**Evidence for Dark Matter ""Very Compelling""**

Physicist David Evans called the new study a ""very interesting theoretical exercise,"" but he said he isn't ready to abandon dark matter just yet.

""The evidence for dark matter is now very compelling,"" said Evans, of the University of Birmingham, who leads the U.K. team for the ALICE detector at CERN's Large Hadron Collider.

For example, in 2006 astronomers unveiled a photo of two colliding galaxies known as the Bullet cluster that purportedly showed the separation of matter from dark matter.

A similar effect was observed in the Pandora cluster earlier this summer, said Evans, who was not involved in the study.


Hajdukovic said he is currently expanding his theory to account for these observations. His preliminary calculations, he said, suggest that ""what is observed in the Bullet cluster and more recently at the Pandora cluster may be understood in the framework of the gravitational polarization of the quantum vacuum.""

CERN physicist Michael Doser agreed that Hajdukovic's ideas are ""unorthodox"" but did not immediately dismiss the new theory.

""The mainstream view suffers from the lack of a detected dark matter particle, and so exploring a wide range of possibilities is at this moment perfectly legitimate, as long as they are compatible with all data,"" Doser said in an email.

Doser is a member of CERN's AEgIS experiment, which aims to measure the gravitational charge of antihydrogen, the antimatter version of hydrogen, and thus would prove whether matter and antimatter are gravitationally repulsive.

""In a few years,"" Doser said, ""we should definitely be in a position to confirm or refute [Hajdukovic's] hypothesis.""

The problem is not simply a numerical unemployment in general, the problem is the general disappearance of whole large categories of jobs that meant the backbone and stability of society through automatization and outsourcing: blue-collar factory workers, white-collar paper-pushers and bean-counters, and so on.

There will be some sort of a solution - automatization isn't exactly new - but probably not within the limits of the traditional education system, there will have to be major rethinking done what kind of job would a typical 21st century man do.

How this effect the bands is a large number of jobs used to be hunter, gather and textile based. Examples include fur trade, hand made textiles and meats. With changes in farming its now faster and easier to raise animals for skins vs hunt for them. Peopels diets have changed to basically fish, pork, chicken and beef. Geese and duck may still be eaten by some small sections of the country or by specific cultures like asian groups but generally outside of racial food perference its not prevalent. This reduced demand less money comes in to the reserves over time. Since there is little to do people begin to socially drink more and more which invites alcholism as a means of escape from boredom. The cycle continues for a generation or two and it becomes acceptable then expected.

To give you an example by uncle is from a northen Quebec reserve. His mother was born during a time when they were still nomadic. She was literally born in an animal skin tent during her life time of roughly 90 years she went from a group which was on the move usually every month or 2. The group was roughly 150 people this changed to a small city of 2000 and it grew to roughly 10,000.

Europeans have been in cities since before recorded history everything most modern civilizations have has been introduced slowly and compounded over generations of development. 

So now you have these people which entire life is changed around the industries they have developed are being eliminated by changes in manufacturing, farming and production. Without any prior generation knowledge to pass on which is applicable and you end up with a huge generation gap in terms of education. Which was further compounded by isolation.

t1_c2gyghl,0,c2gyprk,"&gt; This is just insane, or perhaps a little too ahead of the game. None of Apple's patents are central to making a tablet or a smartphone, and even where Apple has been successful in court the implications have been nowhere near supporting or maintaining a monopoly. You're hyping this up bigger than it actually is.

Except that Apple received an injunction in Germany to withdraw all Samsung Galaxy Tab devices from market... and are even seeking to put legal penalties on owners that do not return their tablets.

As for whether they are central to making a tablet or smartphone... They're claiming that a thin device, flat, rectangular device, with rounded corners, comprised mostly of a touchscreen is their trade dress or design patent (depending on jurisdiction).  That covers it all.

Example:

&gt;3,457,218 (""TD218"")""for the configuration of a rectangular handheld mobile digital electronic device with rounded corners""

&gt;the configuration of a rectangular handheld mobile digital electronic devicewith evenly rounded corners [the iPhone 4]""

Those are two of the trade dress claims Apple has filed against Samsung.  Tell me Apple is not trying to use overbroad claims to block devices.  

And if you say, ""Don't use rounded corners,"" then you are being absurd.

Another ridiculous trade dress claim:

But beyond that, they are seeking injunctions against every major Android manufacturer except LG in order to block their devices from sale.  They are not suing for licensing fees, they are seeking to block the sale of competing devices.

Notably, Samsung makes the exact same phone as the Galaxy S... but with WP7 on it.  The WP7 phone, which isn't a major competitor, isn't identified in the Apple lawsuit to block the sale of Galaxy phones in Europe.

Apple is specifically using their patents and claims of trade dress to push its strongest competitor out of the markets which are the most profitable for the company.

&gt; They're obliged to by the FRAND rules they agreed to when they received essential patents that utilize standard technologies. You said it yourself: ""Samsung and Motorola can't use those patents to block Apple from using those technologies"". That's what they're doing. That's their countersuit. That's why Apple is calling it anti-competitive, because it is!

Samsung's specific legal request regarding all of their patents, including the FRAND patents, is to (aside from fees, past royalties, punitive damages, etc) enjoin Apple from continued infringement.  With regards to the FRAND patents, Apple can cease infringing on those patents by licensing them from Samsung, per the FRAND agreement.  Samsung isn't obliged to separate that out into another suit that would have the exact same prayer for relief.  Nor is the court required, because of Samsung's lumping, to treat the FRAND patents as unencumbered.

Samsung has done nothing wrong.  If the court finds that Apple is infringing on the FRAND patents then the redress will require Apple to license them (for a reasonable and non-discriminatory fee) from Samsung or fuck off.

None of this is any different than if the FRAND patents were in a separate lawsuit.  What is different is that it forces Apple to deal with them concurrently, which is inconvenient for Apple.

That inconvenience pisses Apple off and they're calling it anti-competitive... even though it isn't.  Samsung, rightfully, can request the court to determine if Apple is infringing on those patents.  If Apple hasn't licensed them (and it's apparent they haven't) then they are infringing.

As Mueller points out, the FRAND patents aren't a powerful weapon against Apple.  All Samsung can get from having a court rule on them is some money.  Samsung can't use those patents to assert a monopoly.  Apple is lying through their teeth and needs to STFU.

Oh, it's a big issue. Libya is capable of much more. They have 10 Billion more barrels in proven reserves compared to Nigeria, and Libya is considered a highly attractive oil area due to its low cost of oil production (as low as $1 per barrel), and proximity to European markets, as well as the presence of large amounts of light sweet, which is preferred. They also have enormous stores of freshwater and natural gas.

Another important fact comes from Wikipedia: *""Most of Libya remains unexplored as a result of past sanctions and disagreements with foreign oil companies""*. Well, I guess now we can finally go exploring. 

&gt;Gaddafi wouldn't nationalize the production, the fallout for him would be far too severe and would break any favorable ties he had. I doubt any of the major players actually feared this would happen.

&gt; A value added tax (VAT) is a form of consumption tax. From the perspective of the buyer, it is a tax on the purchase price. From that of the seller, it is a tax only on the ""value added"" to a product, material or service, from an accounting point of view, by this stage of its manufacture or distribution. The manufacturer remits to the government the difference between these two amounts, and retains the rest for themselves to offset the taxes they had previously paid on the inputs.

&gt; The ""value added"" to a product by a business is the sale price charged to its customer, minus the cost of materials and other taxable inputs. A VAT is like a sales tax in that ultimately only the end consumer is taxed.


Each step in the chain except the final consumer essentially buy their goods VAT free and pushes the VAT onto the next step, due to the offset, and in the end everything is pushed to the consumer. At least that is how VAT works in most of Europe.

To explain further: Guy 1 make a good from scratch and sells it for 100. If the VAT is 10% he adds that to the price, i.e. final prize 110 and sends 10 to the tax office. Guy 2 buys the good and resells it for 200, i.e. final prize 220. He sends 20-10=10 to the tax office. In total 10% of 200 has been sent to the tax office and all this cost is pushed to the end consumer who pays 220 for the good. Without VAT in each step the cost would have been 200 for the consumer.",2,True,1314957757,,2,,True,BenderRodriquez,0,,1427549767,t1_c2gz112,0,t3_k037y,gaming,t5_2qh03,False

2. In order to make the enemy route, distract them with a frontal assault and then flank them with something else. Ignore spear units as they take up space, just use cheap samurai. When you hit them in the rear, manoeuvre your cavalry to hit them the moment they pull back. It will both maximise your kills and send them further into disarray as they are flanked on multiple fronts.

3. If you attack Koyoto, everyone attacks you. Don't be afraid of the reputation loss from trading with Europeans/Christianity because it all goes to shit mid-game anyway. Stock up on gunmen, use them to phase out bowmen. Guns are one hit kills (versus multiple hits with arrows) and a huge morale killer. European trading ships have cannons on them, and if you have cannons you'll never lose a naval battle.

4. Missionaries are more of a weapon than samurai are. Use them to build Christian influence in neighbouring provinces, then use them to incite a revolution in those provinces. With the rebels in power, you can take it with no loss of reputation from the original faction. 

5. Trading ports and provinces with a gold mine are the key to success. You can be running a 30k gold income every turn if you take every trading post, max the number of ships in them, and grab one or two gold mines. Invest in economy rather than warfare and you'll be able to spam waves of cheap units while staying afloat financially without foreign clan help, something that it crucial pending realm divide.

**[The world's melting pot: London has always been a multicultural metropolis](http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/the-worlds-melting-pot-london-has-always-been-a-multicultural-metropolis-1436687.html) - ROY PORTER**

*The truth is it isn't new at all. London always was a city of foreigners. For much of its history the percentage of Londoners born outside the capital was actually far higher than today. In a remarkable book, A City Full of People (Methuen), the historian Peter Earle establishes that around 1700, when Samuel Pepys was an old man, Daniel Defoe in his prime and William Hogarth but a boy, a clear majority of Londoners had not been born in the capital. Many had come from overseas: Huguenots from France, Jews from Spain and Eastern Europe, Scandinavians and Germans, Moors and other Mediterranean types. And there are flocks of Welsh, Scots, Irish, and people from the ends of England. Cumbrians and Cornishmen might not seem 'foreigners' to us, but that's how they were perceived at the time, with their different ways and dialects: one sailor around 1700 told a court he spoke 'English and Devon'.*

*A hundred and fifty years later, under Queen Victoria, things were much the same. Between 1841 and 1851, a third of a million streamed into the capital, representing a staggering 17 per cent of London's total population. Similar numbers arrived in the 1850s and 1860s.*

*The majority of these came from a few ethnic groups. Nearly 50,000 arrived from Ireland in the 1840s alone, fleeing the famine. By 1850, London's Jewish population had increased to about 20,000, and in the following fifty years, as refugees deluged in from central Europe, Poland and Russia, it had leapt to 120,000.*

*The city always had pockets of more exotic sorts. By 1800 there were several thousand Black Africans, mostly servants and sailors but also a few musicians, prize-fighters, gigolos and writers. Lascar sailors settled from South East Asia, and from 1800 Limehouse was acquiring its Chinese community; the notorious opium dens came later.*

*This ceaseless flow of migration shouldn't surprise us for a second. After all, Londinium was founded by the Romans, conquered by Saxons and Normans and developed as a commercial centre by Italian, Flemish and Baltic traders. It was always a honeypot for potential Dick Whittingtons (he came from Gloucestershire).*

*If the streets were not paved with gold, the capital always had work, and wages were good. So people poured into what a rather jaundiced 18th-century commentator called 'that great and famous city, which may truly be said, like the Sea and the Gallows, to refuse none'. Without migrants London would never have been famous for silks and watches (made by French craftsmen); it would have lacked ice-cream (made by Italians living in Finsbury) to say nothing of the music of Handel.*",5,True,1314958808,,5,,False,RitesOfTheGods,0,,1427549787,t1_c2gz2kz,0,t3_k28oa,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,False

http://www.michaelparenti.org/Tibet.html

Excerpt:

&gt; The Tibetan serfs were something more than superstitious victims, blind to their own oppression. As we have seen, some ran away; others openly resisted, sometimes suffering dire consequences. In feudal Tibet, torture and mutilation‚Äìincluding eye gouging, the pulling out of tongues, hamstringing, and amputation‚Äìwere favored punishments inflicted upon thieves, and runaway or resistant serfs. Journeying through Tibet in the 1960s, Stuart and Roma Gelder interviewed a former serf, Tsereh Wang Tuei, who had stolen two sheep belonging to a monastery. For this he had both his eyes gouged out and his hand mutilated beyond use. He explains that he no longer is a Buddhist: ‚ÄúWhen a holy lama told them to blind me I thought there was no good in religion.‚Äù Since it was against Buddhist teachings to take human life, some offenders were severely lashed and then ‚Äúleft to God‚Äù in the freezing night to die. ‚ÄúThe parallels between Tibet and medieval Europe are striking,‚Äù concludes Tom Grunfeld in his book on Tibet.

&gt;why the poverty? 

Many reserves are in remote areas, there is no work. They don't want to leave because of te stigma attached to leaving and if/when they do they face institutionalized racism and a much different society in which they are accustomed to living. 

&gt;Why the drugs? 

Well, thats two fold. When you're living in abject poverty and pretty depressing circumstances drugs and alcohol relieve the pain. The other reason is that during the time of colonization European traders used to take advantage of native traders by trading lots of cheap alcohol for expensive furs and pelts, the indigenous never having seen alcohol before quickly became addicted, whole tribes of alcoholics. This creates a cycle which is exasterbated by the depressing circumstances in which they now live. 

&gt;Why are the reserves dumps?

Well, the residents are dirt poor and have addiction issues so the maintenance of their properties are severely lacking. There's usually a few generations living in the same shack which should have been condemned a few generations back and there is a lot of corruption in band councils so maintenance of the reserve gets neglected as well. 

The reason these issues are even harder to fix is because most of the reserves who are facing these problems, because not all reserves have these problems, are remote and suspicious of outsiders. They have been living this way for generations so even if they were given the ""tools"" to fix these problems they wouldn't know how to change, many of them don't know another way to live.

2. The nation-state as a word and concept came in the 18 and 19th century sure, but Sweden has in practise been one since the early middle ages. Taken from wikipedia: *""The nation-state is a state that self-identifies as deriving its political legitimacy from serving as a sovereign entity for a nation as a sovereign territorial unit.[1] The state is a political and geopolitical entity; the nation is a cultural and/or ethnic entity. The term ""nation-state"" implies that the two geographically coincide, and this distinguishes the nation-state from the other types of state, which historically preceded it.""* I would say that this pretty much defines Sweden and Sweden going back nearly a 1000 years. Here too I would say as above, words are words.

3. He does not, he do however hold a few non-party-aligned political missions of diplomatic character. He represent Sweden.

4. When counting precentages of how many are of higher education Sweden will come on top since our educational system isnt as privatized as the US system, but this also allowes for ""idiots"" to gain higher education, for good or worse. In the US it is often the political, economical and sophisticated elite who gets college-level education due to its system. In short, Sweden probably has a higher precentage of highly educated people while the US has a higher quality of said education and the people educated. I do not have a good source for this, you only need to have a basic understanding of things to draw these conclusions.

5. I do not know if you live in a big city, outer suburbs or the countryside but surely you must agree that people in bigger cities tend to have a colder attitude against others while in smaller communities there's another sense of, well community.

6. EU not a very tightly knit union really. A better comparison would be the Soviet union and DDR. While the DDR indeed was a state of its own with an own government, an own army it was still entirely under the control of Moscow, just as Oslo was under Swedish control.

There is enough opportunity and diversity (of people, culture, climate, environment) that traveling within the US itself can be a rewarding experience (and cheaper too!)


2, 4, 5.  This kind of question seems to treat all Americans as one unified group of people. We are not.  This kind of simplification is something Americans are often accused of when talking about people from other countries.  The same people who condemn 'elitism' are not necessarily people who believe the USA is automatically the best in everything.

t1_c2gxz0c,0,c2gzap6,"&gt;Oh course the super rich pay a larger burden, but I'm talking about % of their income, not % of taxes paid in the US. Of course they pay more when they have that much more money, 1% of their income is more than a lot of poor people will pay in their lives I'd bet.

So you think the top 1% should have a 20% tax rate because they have 20% of the nation's income?  Guess what, they pay more than that too.  Again,  the upper class is overpaying by your standard.

&gt;And it has nothing to do with it being someone elses money, I would have the same opinion no matter how much money I had. I would be happy on $60k a year for the rest of my life with no issue. And if I was making billions a year, I would give all else above that $60k a year to my country and charities. I'd give away 99% of it, not a single issue on my end.

Good for you.  Where I live, $60k would barely cover a 2 bedroom apartment in a nice neighborhood.

&gt;Now I'm not saying we should force the uber rich to give away 99% of their income, but is 70-80% so bad? Really? With how much they make? Considering the poor giving away even 20% of their income absolutely destroys their families wealth? Same question with corporations in the US...

Yes, it is.  Why does society have the right to keep more of a person's earnings than the person doing the work?

&gt;And again, the poor contribute, stop arguing otherwise; they contribute something to their society and government. Whether you see a single penny of that from services you use personally means absolutely nothing. The fact is, they contribute, or at least a majority of them try and would probably like to be able to if they cannot.

A majority of them contribute nothing to the operation of most of the federal government.  That's what we have been discussing.  

Also, why do you assume that most of them would really like to contribute if they could, since they are also greedy, evil Americans, only looking out for themselves?

&gt;Also, if you say you contribute more for a person in your position than you would in any other country in the world, might want to look at Norway, lately rated the #1 place in the world to live and do business. I guarantee you would be paying even more in taxes there, yet somehow you would be happier apparently.

I was referring to my share of the burden, not raw numbers, though some members of the upper class in the US do pay near-European level tax rates once you consider state and local taxes.  The lower class in Norway also contributes, unlike the US.  By the way, I see no study backing up your claims about Norway.

Maybe they're happier as a group because everyone is pitching in, rather than having a group carrying the burden and a group of parasites always asking for more, but I'm quite happy where I am.

1) The USA is big (2.5 times the size of Western Europe), varied, and full of interesting places to travel.  Also, until very recently (2007-2009, depending on mode of travel), US citizens were able to travel to most nearby countries (Canada, Mexico, island nations such as the Bahamas) without a passport.  The US now requires a passport to reenter the country from any other, so US passport use should dramatically increase.

2) This is not true in my experience.

3) That seems to be a very complicated answer involving both poverty and cultural issues.  [Here's someone else's attempt to answer that](http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Why_are_so_many_African-Americans_in_prison).

4) That's probably true.  But is it unique to the USA?  Very few people seem to like being criticized by outsiders.  

5) The USA is very patriotic/jingoistic in many ways.

6) Yes, I think so, despite difficult economic times.  

* The US has a long history of absorbing huge numbers of immigrants.  Historically every single group of immigrants has been treated very, very poorly for a generation or two, but they then are considered part of the culture.   So for a newcomer arriving from a really bad situation, the American Dream would be possible.
* Unlike many third-world countries, it is entirely possible to start life in poverty and through hard work / study completely change your situation.  
* I think that this is because in the US there aren't really social classes, just economic ones, and movement between economic class is accepted.  
* Also someone attending only free public school can get a good education and then get grants/loans to pay for a good university.

They have some nice trains and long vacations - whatever, it's otherwise not a hugely different culture or power structure.

5) Elitism in that context refers to economic (or in some cases intellectual) elitism, and the belief that the average man is no better or worse than the 'elite' - and a country that promotes that belief is 'the best'.  Now, I'm perfectly aware that for 30+ years economic inequality has gotten way out of control and a lot of the world has caught up to or exceeded the US technologically / politically - but that hasn't exactly registered for some people out there.  See answer to question 1.

6) I guess it depends on your definition.  The FDR-era idea that a blue collar worker can get a nice white picket fence house in the suburbs and not stress about the basics of life (education &amp; health care) is one that's obviously not the same anymore as we've transitioned to a service based economy and have larger disparities of wealth (see answer to question 5) - but the larger dream of America is one of choice of lifestyle and privacy, which I think exists in the nation more than most (if not all) other western nations.",117,True,1314966610,,117,,True,Kman17,0,,1427549966,t1_c2gzg6u,0,t3_k2ch2,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,False

t3_k1xdg,0,c2gzidj,"About two years ago, my girlfriend and I had just started dating. About two weeks after we met, she had her aunt and uncle and cousins fly in from out west for a small family reunion-type thing. The family is mostly Eastern European so they drink. A lot. 

So it was a Sunday night and we're all sitting around a fire pit, drinking beer and wine and talking...it gets late and girlfriend decides she needs to go to sleep because she had to work in the morning (she still lived at home at the time).

Well, I had Monday off and girlfriend's now hammered mother, aunt, and uncle all implore me to stay and keep drinking. I thought, ""well, fuck it, what could go wrong?""

After another couple of hours, everybody starts to fall out...aunt and uncle go home, girlfriend's dad goes to sleep (also had to work) and its just me and GF's mom. (Also, this story isn't going in a sexual direction, as much as I now realize it sounds like it is.) 

So GF's mom says we should KEEP drinking. Well, I'm the FNG and don't want to tell the mom ""no"" so I agree to ONE more. We consume that last drink and now I am ready to head out. 

So GF's mom is typically very talkative and I happened to notice that just as I was leaving, she got eerily quiet. She was standing there, awake, looking at me as I was saying goodbye, just kinda looked a little...blank.

Then, just as I turned to close the door, she faceplants. On the hardwood floor. I mean she led with her face, completely limp, directly into the floor. She hit it so hard, in fact, that she woke up my GF and her husband.

At this point I am helping her off the floor and propping her up against the couch, trying to tell her to lie down somewhere so she doesn't fall again.

Fortunately, her husband came down and got her. At this point, she turned on me...looked at me with quite the scowl and said, ""who the fuck are you? I am with HIM"" gesturing towards her husband.

Oh, sure, we can levy taxes in the US and Europe to cut back on our usage.  Let's say that we in the US cut our emissions by 50%.  That reduces the world's budget by 2900 million metric tons.  Maybe we could get 600 MMT from Japan, 400 from Germany, 200 from the UK, 200 from France, 200 from Italy, 150 from Spain.  

In order to reduce the world's CO2 emissions, by under 5000 MMT, those 1st world countries will have to stop producing things.  We don't expend carbon dioxide for listening to our iPods, we expend CO2 in power plants and transportation.  If we are to cut our emissions by half, we've got to stop using 50% of our electricity, and stop traveling to and from work and/or shipping goods around.

So, in order to produce less CO2, the vast majority of Americans will have to drop their electricity bill, stop ~~going to~ traveling for work, and stop buying goods that have to be shipped.

I'm already there.  My Carbon Footprint is more like that of a person from a 3rd world country, but I have several advantages.  I drive less than 1000 miles per year, telecommute to work, live in a mild climate, tolerate large swings in temperature (thermostat on 85 in the summer, 55 in the winter), and I'm generally not all that impressed with material goods, so I don't do much shopping.

The problem is that I'm the minority, here.  The typical American makes half of what I do, must travel to his job (and many families have two working adults that have to travel to their jobs separately), and spends more on heating and cooling his home than I do.

So, in order to cut usage by 50%, we jack up the prices for electricity, natural gas, heating oil and transportation fuel, right?  That's the best plan.  How much of an increase in cost will be needed to cut usage?

Let's say it's 20%, just to have a number to work with.  You're right, the rich just go out to eat once less a month.  That takes care of 10% of the population.  How about the 16% of the population in the US who are now already on food stamps because they can't afford food?  How will increasing their burden by 20% affect their lives?

What about the 30% of the population who are just getting by now, who don't make enough money to put anything into savings, but are living okay?  Will a 20% bite into their usable income be able to be absorbed easily?  What will they have to do to cut back. They could stop heating and cooling their homes, or stop going to work.  Or they could stop buying extra goods and services.

What will happen to our economy if 50% of the people stop buying any goods or services that are not strictly needed for survival?  Our federal government just borrowed more than a Trillion dollars to dump into the economy because people were not spending enough money. It made just a tiny bit of difference, just enough to keep us from going into a severe depression.  

So, let's take your route and yank 20% (or more) of the income half the country needs to survive out of it just for the sake of reducing the world's CO2 budget by 10%.  You will collapse the economy and cause real harm to a minimum of 150 million people, but hey? it could reduce the temperature of the earth by 0.05 degrees, right?  Oh, wait, no.  It won't actually reduce the temperature of the earth at all, it will just slow the advance, because India and China combined produce somewhere around 9 Billion metric tons of CO2.",1,True,1314967515,,1,,False,deck_hand,0,,1427549996,t1_c2gzij7,0,t3_k09hh,worldnews,t5_2qh13,False

Despite this decline, the U.S. will still remain a great power on the world stage -- it simply won't be THE world power. 

Meanwhile, in Europe, I see one of two things happening: either the European Union completely collapses or becomes much, much more unified. This will all depend on whether the Euro is able to keep it together and the only way I see for this to happen is if the EU develops a continent-wide fiscal policy placed above those of its member states. A unified monetary and, now, fiscal policy will, in turn, pave the way for further political unification. 

North Korea will eventually collapse, leading to a flood of refugees into South Korea and China. The country's already held together with, basically, duct tape and paper clips. The question of whether North Korea falls is not a matter of ""if"" but ""when"" and ""how much damage will it do when it finally does?"" 

China is actually more difficult to predict than a lot of people seem to think. That its influence will grow over the next hundred years, that much seems certain.

t3_k2ch2,0,c2gzokq,"&gt;Question 1. I was talking to a Canadian guy last night who studied in California. He said it wasn't uncommon for a perfectly normal, healthy, well-educated American to not own a passport. When I thought about it I realised that I've travelled to many countries all over the world and met under 5 Americans. Question: Why don't you guys travel?

A lot of people do travel, but they stay within the U.S. Our states are much like European nations, and most are much larger than one entire country (land-wise) from Europe. Our ""average"" sized state is probably the size of one of Europe's larger countries. So really traveling out of country adds quite a bit of expense (passport plus other fees). I've traveled quite a bit, and I wish more would do so. I think it would change the course of this country (and the world). 

&gt;Question 2. I've heard that Americans take themselves very seriously. Even heard the US referred to as an 'irony-free zone'. Is this true? If not, why do people say this?

I don't think so. The humor tends to be different. We tend to be more ""optimistic"" I guess (that is how I heard it put once). But I guess it depends upon the person really. I'm pretty loose and relaxed, and know plenty like me. 

&gt;Question 3. Why are there so many African-Americans in jail?

Because the police presence in their neighborhoods tends to be stronger and most live in the ""inner city"", where crime rates tend to be higher as well. So generally they don't ""get away"" with as much as ""suburban white folk"" (even though drugs tend to be just as prevalent in suburbia). 

&gt;Question 4. You readily admit your country's short-comings among one another but when a foreigner says anything against the USA, Americans tend to turn ultra-patriotic and abrasive. Why?

Because, they mistake patriotism for nationalism. I am patriotic and love my country, which is why I will openly criticize my government, regardless of who is office because I want to see my country lead the world, not compete with it.

&gt;Question 5. Why is is that 'elitism' is frowned upon, but there are no qualms about claiming that the USA is the best country in the world?

See above. That and like most people in the world, we are hypocrites. 

&gt;Question 6. Does the 'American Dream' still exist?

In my opinion, no. It has become increasingly hard to traverse the social barriers that exist (mainly financial). Most people have a crushing debt by the time they leave college (myself included), and never really escape that. Part of the reason is we have gone more towards a consumerist model. Everything has cartridges, and needs refills, or something of the sort. So you are ""stuck"" in spending all the money you just earned on material goods and debt. They say now that it is called the American Dream because you have to be sleeping to believe it.",2,True,1314969548,,2,,False,madman86,0,,1427550079,t1_c2gzokq,0,t3_k2ch2,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,False

2. American culture can be very self-centered, self-important and arrogant. There is a tendency for America to mistakenly view itself as the best at areas in which it is average or below average. I believe this stems from it's isolation from the rest of the world, and the fact that for a long time (until ~WW2) the official governmental policy was non-intervention.

3. In my opinion, primarily the drug war. By keeping drugs illegal, the people who are most hurt are the lower-class, which tends to create a cycle where Blacks stay lower class because of cultural stigma, and the cultural stigma persists because the lower class is more likely to resort to illegal activities. It's a bit more complicated than that, but that's my basic perception.

4. I think this tends to be the case for any social group or nationality. Nobody wants their faults pointed out by somebody who doesn't share them. I don't see this as uniquely American.

5. Elitism within the country separates people into different social groups, and thus the non-elites resent the elites for the same reason Americans don't want their country's issues pointed out by foreigners.

6. The ""American Dream"" is largely just the concept that anybody can work their way to the top with enough luck and hard work. I believe this is likely true almost anywhere in the civilized world, America just made a bigger deal out of the concept.

&gt;The occupying power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies Article 49, paragraph 6 of the 

Fourth Geneva Convention


&gt;All measures taken by Israel to change the physical character, demographic composition, institutional structure or status of the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem, or any part thereof, have no legal validity and that Israel's policy and practices of settling parts of its population and new immigrants in those territories constitute a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and also constitute a serious obstruction to achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East 

UN Security Council Resolution 465 (1980-unanimously adopted)


&gt;That the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property which, under principles of international law or in equity, should be made good by the Governments or authorities responsible. 

UN resolution 194 (Article 11)


&gt;that the policy and practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967 have no legal validity and constitute a serious obstruction to achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East. 

UN Security Council Resolution 446


&gt;The EU has stated unequivocally for decades that the settlements in the OPT are illegal, but Israel continues to build them. Like any other state, Israel should be held accountable for its actions. It is the credibility of the EU that is at stake. 

Romano Prodi, Former President of the European Commission


&gt;The Council reiterates that settlements, the separation barrier where built on occupied land, demolition of homes and evictions are illegal under international law, constitute an obstacle to peace and threaten to make a two-state solution impossible. The Council urges the government of Israel to immediately end all settlement activities, in East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank and including natural growth, and to dismantle all outposts erected since March 2001.

The United States is the size of the European Continent, and unlike Europe, already contains pretty much every type of climate/terrain feature there is, we also didn't used to need them for travel to most countries on our continent (Canada, Carribean Islands, Mexico, etc). Travel to other continents is also often relatively expensive, being that we're across an ocean from everything but South America. As a result, it's not that it's impossible to travel to other countries by any means and tons of us do, but it's easy to see why we don't all when you remember that our country is like having from Moscow to Barcelona to Oslo in the same country.

This is due to changing fashions. Beauty preferences will change people's appearance in certain directions over time, but I don't think the timescale is long enough in this case.

There is the actual appearance-changing fashions ‚Äî makeup, hairstyle and clothes (makeup and hair in particular can subtly alter the perception of one's facial structure) ‚Äî and there's the selection process. Fashionable-looking people are pushed to the front, in the media and in the public, more so than unfashionable ones.

Beauty ideals change over time. For example, back in 18-19th century Europe, there was a long period where beauty was associated with certain ""regal"" characteristics. Dark hair, relatively thin lips, high cheekbones, large, heavy-lidded eyes. Thick, sensual lips was seen as a sort of asymmetry, like having a big nose.

If you look at women in US mainstream media the last 15-20 years or so, you will notice a weird predilection for a certain type, which I like to call the Cindy Crawford type: Prominent, square jaw, high cheekbones, long hair, long thin noses: [1](http://lauranachman.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/erika.jpg), [2](http://www.midlifebachelor.com/images/wotm/AlyciaLane2.jpg), [3](http://www.blgrr.com/link_images/img_460.jpg), [4](http://www.bittenandbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/nicole-lapin-is-a-hot-anchor.jpg).

Griechische Sonnenenergie f√ºr Deutschland?

31.08.2011: Die Idee von Bundesfinanzminister Wolfgang Sch√§uble, Solarstrom aus Griechenland im gro√üen Stil nach Deutschland zu exportieren, nimmt offenbar konkrete Formen an. 

Wie das Bundeswirtschaftsministerium PHOTON best√§tigte, hat der griechische Umwelt- und Energieminister, Georgios Papakonstantinou, dem Wirtschafts-Staatssekret√§r, Stefan Kapferer, bei dessen Aufenthalt in Athen in der letzten Woche Grundz√ºge eines Solarkonzeptes mit dem Arbeitstitel ¬ªHelios¬´ erl√§utert. Nach einer weiteren √úberarbeitung werde das griechische Ministerium das Projekt der √ñffentlichkeit pr√§sentieren. 

Von einem Teilnehmer der Athener Gespr√§chsrunde erfuhr PHOTON, dass schon mehrere deutsche Unternehmen Interesse an den Pl√§nen bekundet h√§tten. Um welche Unternehmen es sich handelt, ist noch nicht bekannt. Ein Vertreter des griechischen Solarverbandes Helapco sch√§tzt das gesamte Investitionsvolumen des ¬ªHelios¬´-Projektes auf 20 Milliarden Euro, 15 Milliarden f√ºr Solaranlagen und 5 Milliarden Euro f√ºr Netze nach Deutschland. 

Die Kraftwerke k√∂nnten eine Kapazit√§t von bis zu zehn Gigawatt erreichen, erkl√§rte er gegen√ºber PHOTON. Das entspricht in etwa der Gesamtleistung des Kraftwerkparks von Griechenlands Energieriesen, dem Staatskonzern Public Power Corporation (PPC). ‚Ä¶

First of all, Europe is not a uniform country or area with the same health system. Germany has a different population with a different demographic as say, Poland or Italy. 

Secondly, Germany (for example) has very many old patients with a seven years higher median age than compared to the United States (and a longer live-expectancy), which again goes to show, that if at all, german patients are usually even older than american patients [(Source)](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=demographic+germany+usa).

Add islands and territories like Hawaii and Puerto Rico, and then a place like Alaska, and a passport or visiting other countries isn't needed to still see a lot of stuff and do a lot of things. It's also much cheaper to stay in the US. Europe and Australia are the other ""First World"" hubs and they're very far away. 

2. This isn't true. America is vast and varied enough that it really depends on where you are within the country, to determine the kind of humor and ""seriousness"" of the population.

3. Black people have a tumultous, vicious circle kind of thing going on in the US. A disproportionate amount are born into bad situations/low socioeconomic conditions, so ""getting ahead"" and not turning to crime is a harder choice. They don't start out on a level playing field, so to speak. It's a mix of economic and cultural problems that's self perpetuating.

4. Honestly? Because everyone loves to hate America, and I get sick of it. I wouldn't expect people from other countries to be like ""Oh haha yeah my country totally sucks!"" and take abuse from foreign people, and I feel the same way about my country. I never asked to be an American citizen- my country has its problems, but for better or worse it is my country and people who act like America is the end all of first world evil piss me off. I also get annoyed at the assumption that Americans are obnoxious travelers- we may be a bit naive due to isolation, but it seems from actual polling of people that Americans are typically very friendly and polite. I guess in a nutshell it's just gotten to the point that America bashing is tired and bothersome, and it starts to reek of sour grapes. People should stop comparing their much smaller, much different countries to the plight of the USA.

5. ""Elitism"" is the idea that on a personal level, you're better than someone else. The whole American dream is that no matter what you're born into, you can drag yourself up if you just work hard enough. The fact that this our driving ideal and principle is what inspires the whole ""America, fuck yeah!"" mindset. Also, the US is pretty new, all things considered. White people have only been here for a few centuries, as opposed to thousands over in Europe. This means we don't really have the same deep well of culture to draw upon for our identity as a nation, thus we may cling a little illogically or fiercely to the few things we can.

6. I read a quote recently that said, ""The problem with America is no one thinks of themself as a poor person, but rather an embarrassed millionaire who's down on his luck."" That's pretty much our American dream- that every one of us can achieve success financially and socially and stuff, as long as we work hard and persevere. This unfortunately makes the middle and lower class easy to manipulate by wealthy people... Americans spend more time working than most other populations of developed nations (which is why the ""lazy American"" stereotype also pisses me right the fuck off), we hesitate to heavily tax the wealthy (because we might be them someday, right?!) and so on. But, rags to riches stories still happen frequently enough that yes, I think the ""American dream"" still exists, it's just going to evolve and shift.

t3_k2ch2,0,c2gzucb,"- We do travel, and we travel a lot, for both business and pleasure. That said, it is a longer trip for Americans because geographically we're a lot further away from other countries than say, Europeans or Asians. We can still easily slip over the borders into Mexico or Canada, but those now require passports (whatever, one's easy enough to get). Also, do bear in mind that the U.S. itself is a very large country and it's very possible to travel extensively without really leaving it's borders. It's very diverse no matter where you go.

- ""The irony-free zone""? Lol, that's new. But nope, I'm gonna have to disagree with you on this one. Americans are pretty funny and we love to laugh and have fun. Just look at our entertainment to see that for yourselves. As for the being too serious reputation, we definitely work hard, but I think we play way harder which makes up for that.

- As disgusting as it is to admit, there are still racial and social inequalities here in the United States. Unfortunately, African-Americans have earned a bad reputation as a result of these inequalities. In a nutshell, many African-Americans tend to be of much lower socio-economic status than other Americans. Poor people are less educated and (arguably) poorly provided for, and are therefore more prone to engaging in criminal behavior such as theft, drug-dealing, and murder. The same could be said of Hispanic-Americans or Asian-Americans, many of whom find themselves in the same category as African-Americans. **And if our government could just grow a pair, you'd see a lot more prosecution of white collar crime and there'd be a hell of a lot more white people in jail (where their self-indulgent, greedy spoiled asses belong)**.
- It's like having a little brother or sister. You can talk shit about them all you want, but if someone else says something nasty you're gonna step up and protect what you love. I readily admit my country has a lot of serious shortcomings, and I can handle a foreigner pointing that out to me. What I won't abide is commentary from someone who judges us as a whole by our gov't, who has never been to the United States, or who buys into crap about Americans just because it's cool to hate on us. It is very possible to have a productive conversation with an American about the state of our country, so long as you pay us the same respects we pay you in regards to your own home. 

- ""Elitism"" as it's referred to here in the U.S. is a talking point for political candidates who have a certain (usually more conservative) agenda. It's a way for ambitious would-be presidents to make education, success/wealth, and world-awareness seem like a bad thing. *If a person is ""elite"", how can s/he connect with the everyman, someone who struggles for what they have?* Keep in mind, there are a lot of Americans who still credit hard physical labor and straight-up Americans values for their success (we're talking farmers, laborers, ect.) and who don't necessarily believe education or worldliness is the only way towards a better life. Obama is continually referred to as an elitist because he had the nerve to go to Harvard and become a wealthy lawyer. People like Sarah Palin have convinced the blue collar worker down in the Appalachians that this is bad, because he's too smart or too rich to care for or understand their day-to-day problems. Whatever. The people complaining about elitism are the ones who continue to scrape the bottom of the barrel financially and intellectually.

- The American Dream still exists, but it's very subjective. Not all Americans want the same things. My American Dream is to continue doing what I love (I'm a teacher) for as long as I can do it. Financial success isn't really my greatest aspiration, but if I can someday buy a house and squeeze out a kid, everything's cool. Others only want money and they'll work hard to achieve that goal because it's their right to be successful.

No the prices in Europe are so high because you buy most of it from the middle east while America only gets 20% from there. America also showers the Saudis with gifts and gives massive subsidies to the oil industry.

What would I say if the prices did double? I would say good. If we ever want to switch to renewable energy than we need the government to stop interfering with the market and let the price come to its real value. That will make other energy sources much more cost effective and encourage massive investments into alternatives. 

That is all without mentioning that if we had invested the war funds into renewable energy, then by now, we wouldn't need a single drop of oil from the middle east.

t3_k2ch2,0,c2gzyc6,"&gt;Question 1. I was talking to a Canadian guy last night who studied in California. He said it wasn't uncommon for a perfectly normal, healthy, well-educated American to not own a passport. When I thought about it I realised that I've travelled to many countries all over the world and met under 5 Americans. Question: Why don't you guys travel?

We have most every climate, beautiful parks, all in an area where everyone speaks the same language and uses the same money- which simplifies travel for work-weary vacationers.  I can fly from NY to Florida for 99 bucks and sit on the beach for a weekend, or I can spend thousands to get elsewhere.  Kids are spoiled rotten, and are difficult to travel with.

&gt;Question 2. I've heard that Americans take themselves very seriously. Even heard the US referred to as an 'irony-free zone'. Is this true? If not, why do people say this?

We're wickedly heterogeneous.  Imagine if europe was one country, and where you'd still have regions, there were population centers of every nationality spread throughout.  It'd be much harder to agree on things.  These groups have coalesced and support themselves and thus it's difficult to rail on one piece without offending the sensibilities of someone.

&gt;Question 3. Why are there so many African-Americans in jail?

Drug laws created a prohibition situation where the black market is the most profitable economy.  Violent crime is a major part of black market economics (like with the mafia during alcohol, so too with gangs with drug prohibition).  As well, welfare subsidies have created a class of people (not just people of color) who subsist on government care.  Massively matriarchal, Males have few role models (fathers leave, no male school teachers), which creates a situation where boys don't really value the virtues of fatherhood.  The lack of role models leads to wayward youths, and thus violent crime.

&gt;Question 4. You readily admit your country's short-comings among one another but when a foreigner says anything against the USA, Americans tend to turn ultra-patriotic and abrasive. Why?

Same reason your family would do it.  ""I'm the only one allowed to discipline my kids"".

&gt;Question 5. Why is is that 'elitism' is frowned upon, but there are no qualms about claiming that the USA is the best country in the world?

Elitism, as you refer to it, isn't what you think it is.  It's not the jingoisitic ""America is the best!"" as I hear it referred to.  Elitism, as described, is really that academic 'holier than thou' attitude of the power classes.  The people who walk into institutions like schools and prisons and think that because they have a fancy degree, they are qualified to run the place- even though they have no direct experience in that area.  It's the idea, ""I'm better than you, so I know how to better run your life than you do"".  Individualism is a big deal.

&gt;Question 6. Does the 'American Dream' still exist?

Yes.  Definitely yes.  If you dedicate yourself, you can be what you want to be.  There's nothing really standing in your way save for yourself.  Certain political ideals say that 'because the parents are boorish and uneducated, the kids don't stand a chance', which is patently false.  A kid from any situation can (and they do) grow up to be whatever they really want, if they have the chops to accomplish it.  That said, they have to deserve it.  Just like in an MMO, you can reach the very top, but it takes dedication and skill.

Not a mental health issue as such, though it certainly seems to be seated in the brain, so either the brain has to get fixed or the body does. At present, the science of changing brain structures in living people isn't developed enough to enable surgeons change the brain structure of a male into that of a female, or vice-versa.

t3_k2ch2,0,c2h01hm,"One of the reasons that we don't travel is that most of us cannot afford it.  The wealth disparity in our nation is equivalent to the disparity in the Dictatorships in the worst parts of Africa.  That is not an exaggeration.  The top 20% wealthiest Americans capture over 60% of our national income, and the bottom 60% capture less than .3% of the income.  That means the majority of us Americans COMBINED earn less than 3 one thousandths of our nation's annual Gross Domestic Product.  Despite the fact that I earn many times what someone in a third world country might earn, my expenses are many more times what theirs are, and I have less ability to save than you'd expect.  As an example of this, I personally make around $X per year, while my living expenses, not including the debt I have to pay off from school loans and credit cards, are around $(X-400) per year.  Considering that it costs about $1500 for a round trip ticket from one of our international airports to London, and that many need to fly domestically to get to an international airport, as they are only located in major cities, it may cost, say $1800 to travel to and from Europe.  This does not include hotel stays, food, or tour/museum fees.  Just to save up for the flight, it would take me 5 years of all of my savings, if I never ate out, never got better food than canned soup, never attended a movie, and never bought anything else for myself beyond the very basic necessities.  This also assumes that my 27 year old car with 300,000 miles on it (482,803.2 km) does not break down for 5 years.  This is highly unlikely.

Edit:  Also, I get no paid vacation, so I'd need to save the extra money to pay the rent and bills while I am gone, which would be an additional $600 bucks or so if I take a 2 week trip.  Also, I am a entry level engineer, but the job market is so bad that unemployment in my field is hovering around 30% and its higher for entry level guys, so I cannot get a better job.

t3_k2ch2,0,c2h02l2,"1) Many people in America don't travel to other countries because of a couple reasons.  First of all, America is HUGE.  Like continental Europe huge.  We have world class beaches, world class skiing, hiking, biking, etc.  The differences between cities like New York, Miami, Los Angeles are so great, that they might as well be different countries.

The second reason is that it's expensive.  Up until a few years ago, you didn't need a passport to go anywhere in the carribean, mexico, and Canada.  Flights from the US to Europe are generally $1,000 bucks, and flights from the US to Asia/Australia are usually in the $1,800 range.  You can't buy a $200 rail pass and visit a multitude of countries.

2)  Never heard of this so can't really answer.  Might be about New Yorkers though.  They always seem to have a stick stuck up their ass.

3) Books have been written on this subject and I don't feel like getting into it.

4) It's the exact same way that I can admit that my sister is an idiot, but the moment you say that my sister is an idiot, I'm going to kick your ass.

5)  There is a difference between elitism and patriotism.  Not the same thing.

6) Yes the American dream does exist.  The American dream is the idea that anyone has the opportunity to improve their social standing and the government won't get in there way.  This doesn't mean that everyone who works hard will end up being successful, it's more of the thought of equal opportunity vs. equal outcomes.",1,True,1314973314,,1,,False,[deleted],0,,1427550259,t1_c2h02l2,0,t3_k2ch2,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,False
t3_k2ch2,0,c2h02v0,"1. America is huge, with an incredible amount of geographic diversity. Travelling from one state to another can sometimes be like going to another country (if you're going to the Deep South from anywhere else it's often like going to another planet). America also shares borders with only two countries. One of those countries is functionally the same as America (my apologies to Canadians), and the other is a place that people leave to come live here. 

2. The only proper retort to the ""Americans don't do irony"" canard is The Simpsons. Additionally, people often forget that sarcasm is a form of irony, and it is one in which Americans are adept.

3. Because 400 years ago some European assholes made deals with local African tribes to take their war prisoners away to use as slave labor. Those were the ancestors of the bulk of America's current African American population, and were only emancipated in 1865 (and only guaranteed the right to vote in 1964). African Americans are still largely an economic underclass, and just like any economic underclass that doesn't have access to the same educational and work opportunities as others, individuals sometimes turn to crime. Also, enduring racism plays a role.

4. We aren't talking shit about our country because we're self-hating, we're doing it because we're proud of our country and want to see it become better. Also, look at it this way: If I tell you that my mom can be a bitch sometimes, that doesn't give you the right to jump in and say ""Yeah, and she's ugly too!""

5. ""Elitism"" is one of those conservative code word that actually means something else. In this case it means ""being an educated liberal.""

6. That depends on what you mean by ""American Dream."" If you mean ""own a house and two cars and have 2.3 kids"" then no, but it was never a valid construction anyway. The ""American Dream"" ought to be more of a philosophical thing, the promise that no matter what your background is you have the freedom to pursue your own personal goals. Is this or has it always been the case? No, but it's not a bad place to start.

Basic training is designed to make you want to kill, to be ready for it, to anticipate it and almost yearn for it.  It may not be pretty, but the more you kill of them, the less there will be of them to kill you.  No one actually fights for their country, ever.  They join for their country, maybe, but they do not walk into combat b/c of patriotism.  No one charges a defensive position for their country, or jumps on a grenade for their country.  They do it for their fellow soldier and/or to survive.  We act like this  behavior is different than in previous wars in the last 10,000 years.  The goal is to kill someone, period, nothing else matters if you're a ground pounder.  I am not excusing or condoning their actions but sometimes if you are going to put a drunk person behind the wheel of a car, you can't be shocked when they hit something.  That is why rules of war are so hotly contested and important.  I am for removing ALL rules of war.  All the rules do is try to sanitize for public consumption, which leads to much more death, destructions and new wars.  War should be absolutely terrible for all sides, that way we will not go to war so easily.  Look at Europe, I think they got the idea after WWI and WWII.  We comparatively had an easy go of it in both wars.  Just enough to make it look easy and painless, except for the people getting killed.  You scrape off this idea of civilizing war and a civilized society will look for other options.  The Western world does not need war for anything right now, we make it small, quiet and painless so we have no problem sending troops any and everywhere.

t3_k2ch2,0,c2h04us,"I'm a European but I know the country very well, have lots of American friends, my SO is American, so let me give you an outsider's perspective:

1. Europe is tiny. Going abroad is cheap and easy. America is big and if you want to travel abroad (unless you go to Canada or Mexico), it will cost you a lot of money. If you spend that much money on travelling, you want to spend a longer time there to justify the expense. Americans typically have a lot less holidays than Europeans so for them long-distance travel is a lot more difficult.

2. This is not true. There are dicks everywhere. The Americans I know all have a very good sense of irony and sarcasm (unlike the residents of a few European countries). They have a bit different style of humour than continental Europeans.

3. This is a complex question and it's a consequence of historic and cultural circumstances. The obvious, but not very helpful answer is that there are many African-American criminals who get caught by the police and/or get sentenced by the courts to prison sentence.

4. America is big, there are many different kinds of people there. Some may get offended if you start criticizing their country and get defensive. Some will jump on the bandwagon and join you bashing America. I think there are plenty of people of both types here on Reddit. Personally, I'd be pissed as well if some foreigner would start bashing my country; that's the privilege of my fellow compatriots.

5. America is big, there are all kinds of people there and there are dicks everywhere. That being said, there's a healthy level of patriotism in America, just like in many other countries, such as France.

6. That depends on who you ask, but if you ask me, if you look at the start-up community in the Silicon Valley, it's obvious that yes, it still does.

t3_k2ch2,0,c2h05jq,"&gt;Question 1. I was talking to a Canadian guy last night who studied in California. He said it wasn't uncommon for a perfectly normal, healthy, well-educated American to not own a passport. When I thought about it I realised that I've travelled to many countries all over the world and met under 5 Americans. Question: Why don't you guys travel?

Another redditor has already said it, but I'll say it again:

The United States is huge. Many of us are raised in lower-middle class (or poorer) homes, and do not have much disposable income. I know that for me, as a child growing up in Maine, the thought of flying out of the country for a vacation was completely foreign. I didn't know anyone who had done that until I got to high school. Even flying to another state (Florida and California are popular destinations for many, many people) is expensive. My parents always took vacations either in our state or one nearby (nothing further away than New York).

I visited Canada many times before the passport requirement went into effect. I haven't gone there since. I can't afford a passport, and don't have the time or money to leave the country anyway. I only get two weeks of vacation a year, and since my company is small I can't take more than a few days in a row. That means I could literally never fly anywhere in my current employment situation.

TL;DR: Traveling to other countries from America is a lot more expensive than doing the same in Europe.

[They start at $895.](http://www.kayak.com/#flights/PWM-LON/2011-09-16/2011-09-23) I could never afford to blow that kind of money just to *get myself* overseas, let alone bring a friend or actually *do* something.

In my experience, due to the lack of vacation time, price of schooling, and a variety of other cultural factors, Americans seem much less likely to do large trips abroad.

On the other hand, you have a paper that was *just* published, also in PNAS, that says something very different.

* Whatever you have left over, throw $10,000 or 1 year's worth of expenses (whatever is higher) into a high yield savings account. Never ever touch this.

* Of the rest, even out your investments (A basic savings/checking account is fine for monthly expenses). If you are lucky and play it smart, whatever you invest into now, you should be able to keep and not draw from at the end of your college term.

t3_k2ch2,0,c2h06yp,"**Question One:**  America is a *huge* place.  I mean no disrespect when I say it, but many things that must be done in another country elsewhere (warm beaches, mountains, skiing, etc.) can be done by just driving to another state.  Also, the expense of intercontinental travel is prohibitively expensinve for many.  My flight to S. Africa was $5k.

**Question Two:**  It might be irony free, but our cup runneth over with sarcasm.

**Question Three:**  The disprortionate number of Black people in jail is due to all sorts of factors.  Lack of education, lack of oppotunity, poverty.  I don't believe racism has as huge a role as many believe, but it no doubt is a factor.

**Question Four:**  What 'elitism' means to me is a system of thought whereby one (small-ish) group of people believe they can really decide what's best for me.  Americans are generally a ruggedly individual bunch.  This is why government is generally distrusted and that our model of governance is not as 'social' as that of Europe.

t3_k2ch2,0,c2h075m,"1. As some others have said, America is large and there are some regions that differ significantly from others, even within a one or two hours drive in some cases. An alternative answer is that, like me, many Americans cannot afford the expenses of ""traveling."" In Europe, leaving the country means hopping on a train and riding for two hours; in America, going outside the country almost always means plane tickets, hotel expenses, etc.

2. I don't take myself seriously, but I suspect that the people who have told you that America is an ""irony-free zone"" are referring to either cable news or some people who are about as much fun to be around as an enraged moose.

3. This is a tough one, although the simplest way of explaining it is to say that a huge majority of African-Americans living in the U.S. are descendants of slaves, and that as a result they fit in at the very bottom of the socioeconomic ladder, meaning they live in poverty-stricken areas and have fewer education and self-improvement opportunities. Having grown up in a poor area myself, I can see how committing crimes would seem like the only way to pull yourself out of such a hellish place. There are other (probably bigger) factors, including the acceptance of crime in poor neighborhoods, but that's definitely a big one. In fact, that one's the basis for the argument for some sort of reparations to the black community.

4. Haha, I guess all people are guilty of this to a degree. Its just a matter of pride, I suppose, no matter how silly or unwarranted it is. I am no great patriot, and I'm saddened by how America seems to be shifting, but I still feel a twinge of pride when I hear the Star-Spangled Banner or see our flag. If nothing else, these things are reminders of the only place I have ever called home, and I guess my patriotism comes from that.

5. Again, I don't claim that America is the best country in the world. For about a 90 year period we were the biggest superpower in the world, but today its important to acknowledge that America - at the very least - is probably tied with China and the European Union in terms of global influence, and that if you took military might out of the occasion we'd probably be on the tier below those two. I don't have much insight into this question, I suppose - I dislike elitism and I dislike the ""America's #1"" chanters.

6. Sigh. No. You can still own a home and build a life for yourself, sure, but its nearly impossible now without soul-crushing debt. There are success stories, of course, but by-and-large American businesses will turn a profit by any means necessary, even if it means fucking you into the ground with a dildo made of bill payments and fees and collection agencies and razor blades.

Our country is fucking huge; Canada isn't actually that big, considering a large portion of it is winter wonderland that no one really goes to. We can be tourists in our own country; if you're from New England, going to the Deep South provides plenty of unique cultural experiences, for example. Also, America's geographical isolation really does mean that to travel to not Canada and Mexico, we have to use planes. Not like we can just take the handy trans-European rail to another country.

Question 2: I have no idea what you're talking about; sarcastic, or self effacing humor is pretty much the norm in any Western country at this point. Seinfeld? Hello?!

Question 3: Europe kept its slaves in colonies and ignores the problems of Africa now; we imported ours. This means for several hundred years, we worked pretty efficiently to create a complete underclass in terms of economic opportunity, cultural lineage, and education - that hurt takes time to undo, and one of the consequences of people with drastically reduced means that feel an alienation to a greater society means that they might very well consider breaking its laws as a way to enrich themselves as really not so bad. 


Question 4: Really, really depends on the person - there are plenty of Americans that have figured out its trendy and hip to sort of hate on Americana.

t3_k2ch2,0,c2h0bb5,"1.) Yes, as others have said already, the U.S. is quite a large country with many places to travel within it.  I'm 23, and I recently just got my first passport this year.  I haven't used it yet, but I'm hoping to sometime soon.  In America, you can often find quite a bit of people that have not traveled much or at all even out of their respective state.  I'm not sure why this is, because I love to travel, so I don't understand those people's justifications.  One of my goals, is not only to travel outside of the U.S., but I want to someday be able to say that I have visited all 50 states, which is actually quite uncommon in America.  Another reason why Americans might not travel internationally as much as you may find in other parts of the world, is that America is bound on either side by an ocean.  This makes it much harder and more expensive to just go visit other parts of the world.  In Europe for example, the number of countries one could visit more easily is much larger, because the area is denser, and you don't have to keep crossing a whole ocean every time you want to cross a border.

2.)  I am not sure where you heard that Americans take everything so seriously.  In my experiences, this is not true, and I would have no idea why people might say this.  I think the U.S. is full of irony.

3.)  I think the answer to this question is something that varies from person to person and from race to race.  The best answer is probably a collection of different ideas from different people.  I would also venture to say that this answer would vary from state to state.  The ideologies about poverty, culture, and race vary in each state.  There are still many people in the U.S. that have a problem with race.

4.)  Honestly, I don't really understand all the patriotism in this country.  I can see why people feel patriotic, but I don't understand why patriotism in the U.S. seems to be so much more extreme than what is seen in other countries of the world.  This is a quality about Americans that I don't like much.  A thought on your question though would be for me to ask you how you'd react if I said something negative to you about your country or your patriotism.  I think people like to just stick up for where they come from.

5.)  I think the answer to this question actually has a lot to do with the government in the U.S. and the media that is published around it.  An aspect of it actually almost seems like some sort of cycle, where the government wants the American people to believe that it is the greatest country in the world, and in return the American people will be happy and will feel no reason to try to overthrow the government system or refute it's actions in other parts of the world.

t3_k2ch2,0,c2h0c28,"1. Many reasons. I personally am 22 and just received my passport. However, without one I have traveled to Canada, Mexico, and all over the Carribean including going through the panama canal. Most Americans when they travel will usually travel to either another part of America or a tropical island. Everyone I have ever met dreams of traveling to Europe or somewhere else, but the time and money is usually just not feasible.

2. I can honestly say I have never heard of this? Irony and dry humor are core concepts of comedy here and well received. 

3. This is a complex answer but I'll try to generalize. A long history of being repressed in society has made many African Americans live in lower income areas which result in lifestyles more accepting of lower standards, crime, and low quality education. There is a direct correlation of poverty and low income to crime. There is also a prevalent thug culture, plus some think racism plays a factor.

4. Not everyone does this. However I would relate it to having a child. You may tell your friend that your upset your son is struggling in his math class, but if your friend responded by saying yea your boy sure is dumb, you would instantly defend him.

5. That is two very different things. Americans generally frown upon people claiming to be better than other people. Individualism and equality are core concepts of American ideals. However, to say America is the best country is just talking about something general, abstract. I think most people in my social circle would say this half jokingly, being ironic. I have met many people that do believe this, and I think its a large form of arrogance. To many people, America is less of a country with lines and a boundary,  but more of a concept of ideals. To be American is not to be from America, but to believe and uphold the traditional ideas and morals of what it means to be American. In that regard many people believe America is unique and great because of it.

6. In many ways yes very much so. Maybe not to other industrialized modern countries, but to other poorer ones. Many of my friends, schoolmates, and coworkers come from poor asian, african, and latin american countries that sacrificed heavily to come here for work, family or education. For these people, they have an opportunity to truly change their lives and families lives for the better. My friend Dimas comes from Honduras where as far back as his family can remember they have always been banana pickers. Dimas came here speaking no english, and wound up becoming a top salesman at a cell phone company. He made enough money to bring his whole family over, buy them a house, and give them a life they never dreamed of. That to me is the American dream.

t1_c2gzle5,0,c2h0c9w,"Yes, Saddam was about as much a tyrant as Khadaffi, and Iran as much in need of an domestic uprising. My point is that the US attack on Iran did lack every imaginable support in international law, and did not have any connection to any popular uprising, which the case in Libya, with ongoing attacks on civilian (and other...) protesters had.

I consider UN as a whole as more than just the Security Council, which despite it's imperialistic control was rather hesitantly pushed into an intervention by international and Libyan popular protests. You can't really make the case for others than possibly the French having actively pushed the idea of an intervention in the beginning of this process - with the Brits and Italians guarding their current - not so socialistic - economic interests in Khadaffi, and the Russians and Chinese panicking over any suggestion that tyrants don¬¥t have the right to kill their subjects. Even the club of surrounding autocrats, with Khadaffi an active member, was definitely hesitant - the Libyan protests as a part of the ""arabic spring"" not being their cup of tea either. This does not imply that more than a minority of the Libyan opposition is democratic, or that everybody will be happy in Libya for ever. My only point is that any socialist glorifying Khadaffi *because* he is under attack by NATO has lost his political bearings.

I never suggested that US imperialism is not always wrong, only that the US-NATO-intervention in this particular case can not be interpreted as equivalent to Iraq. Anybody with any political knowledge knows that practical politics always is a question of compromises with awkward partners, unless you¬¥re the Pol-Pot-kind of a socialist. Under the current realistic alternatives I can hardly see NATO as a worse partner for the Libyans than Khadaffi. Start with a basic body count: How many civilian Libyans has Khadaffi murdered? How many similar murders would NATO get away with without Arabic, European and American protests? Of course the money from oil and minerals of Libya ought to be fairly divided between Libyans, but that wasn't Khadaffis policy either.

2. I don't think this is true.

3. They commit crimes.  It has been shown that poor people are more likely to commit crimes.  Black people are more likely to be poor because they still haven't caught up from slavery times and 5 years ago when there were laws restricting their rights.  There is also a persistent anti-intellectualism in ghetto black culture where speaking proper English and reading books is considered ""acting white"" and looked down upon.

4.  Honestly, we are a very large country and we have many different types of people. We don't all do any one thing.  I think people get a bit defensive because it's similar to family.

Personally, I would love to travel and see Europe, etc. But airline tickets to those places are ridiculously expensive for alot of people (including myself). 

It has been said several times that the U.S is huge and is both geographically and culturally diverse. There are plenty of places in the U.S that I have not seen and am dying to (ex. I've only been as far west as Austin, TX). So, when I'm planning a vacation, I don't think overseas, because there is a ton of awesome places in my own country that I have never been too, and it is a hell of a lot cheaper to visit those than flying to Europe. I suspect many American's are in the same boat as me.

t3_k2ch2,0,c2h0cnr,"1.) The USA is large. You can go on a vacation every year for 20 years of your life and still have a long list of places you want to visit. You didn't used to need a passport to go to Canada or Mexico until just recently (last 5 years) so there wasn't much need unless you were flying abroad. Many Americans cannot afford to fly to Europe for vacation.

2.) Some are, some aren't. Many are very serious about their jobs and take success seriously. There is an attitude among many Americans that is you have to earn everything for yourself, don't accept (socialist) help from the government. I think it is mostly people who just take their job too seriously, they wrap up their self worth in their job and nothing else. This seems to be more common in the US than Europe.

3.) For historical reasons (Slavery, Jim Crow Laws, no Civil Rights) A larger percentage of Blacks are in poverty. People in poverty tend to commit more crimes and cannot pay for good legal defense to get out of it. Racism has also played a factor, although it is much better now, it seemed there was a time (especially in some states like Texas) where if someone was murdered or raped you could pretty much grab any black guy off the street and make it stick (this is an exaggeration). Texas had a really bad record of convictions in the 70's-80's and DNA evidence is exonerating many people on death row, most are black.

The war on drugs is also a big thing, blacks are convicted at a much higher rate and given harsher sentences. People with rich or politically connected parents can get charges dropped it seems.

These are generalizations of course.

4.) I don't think that is true. There are plenty of people here who are very critical of the US or recognize many of our faults. Some of the super patriotic types are like that, but they tend to be less educated in general. Also, as others have pointed out I think this is the case in every country, no-one wants to hear people badmouth their country. In my experience Israelis are the most offended by anything negative said about their country. I have known a few who talk about how much better things are in Israel, ask them why did they move to the US? Then they get quiet. This is just an example (not picking on Israelis), I think it is true of most countries.

5.) I think the elitism that is frowned upon is intellectual elites. There are many Americans who don't really value science and are more concerned with religion and moral issues. This is just one group though. There are plenty who value science, education, and rational thought. I think this sort of speak is used in politics more than anything else.

6.) Yeah, the economy sucks right now so buying a home in the suburbs with a picket fence is not easy for most people. Things should recover though. If you come here and start a successful business you can do very well for yourself.

Here's whats going to happen.  As the US moves to more and more draconian ""security"" measurements, another disaster is going to occur.  Be it a terrorist attack or my guess: a viral outbreak.  Eventually the US is going to shift to a complete police-state.  At the same time religious ideology is going to creep into the public conscious, causing the US to become more of a police-state theocracy.  This religious fever is going to cause political strife with the rest of the world.

Simultaneously the US's economy is going to start showing true signs of complete collapse, causing the world economy to shift away from the US.

Cue similar fiasco's as what happened in Iraq.  The US will start invading countries under the guise of ""terrorism"".  These countries will most likely be Muslim in majority.  This is going to cause a not-to-covert new crusade.  Political lines are going to be drawn, and allies are going to be confusing.  The traditional ""Western"" states are going to be split between the two.  Some are going to buy the US's terrorism line, while others are going to recognize the crusade and side against the US.

""Slowly"" other countries are going to be dragged into the conflict,  resulting in a normal world war.

From here there are one of two different results.  If the US-led side wins, the world is going to start shifting into a similar Christian theocracy.  Revolts will start rising, and as a result there is going to be a complete police-state across the world.  This will eventually fall, but not for another couple hundred years.

If the US-led side loses, there is going to be another world war.  The winning side is going to be split.  You are going to see half of this side want to establish a Muslim theocracy, while the other half want to continue a progressive style society (similar to Europe right now).

2.  I don't think this is more true of general people, but it's very true of many high-profile celebrities and politicians.  But watch the Daily Show or Colbert Report if you want to see how average Americans feel about irony and self-deprecation.

3. A long history of poverty and systematic oppression/under-education/discriminaion.  Some on the right would also say a long history of welfare discouraging the poor from working to get good jobs, some on the left would also say institutional racism among police and legislators.

    It's also worth pointing out that the recent (historically) trend towards privately owned prisons and the      'war on drugs' has drastically increased incarceration rates, especially among minorities and the poor; this is something that many Americans are upset about, and is becoming a topic that we are trying to address.

4. I think it's the difference between looking for places we could improve vs. saying we're worse than other countries.  We've defined ourselves historically in opposition to other governments - originally as democracy vs. royalty, more recently as free market democracy vs. communism, etc.  

    So for instance, it's one thing for Americans to point out that our health care system has problems and talk about how to fix them; it's another thing for a Canadian to say our system sucks and we should do it like they do, because many Americans have an idealistic belief in free markets over government controls, even if this is one situation where the private system is currently problematic and in need of an overhaul.

5. 'Elitism' is about one American saying they're better than the rest of us, and that they deserve more power/control because of it.  This is different from saying that collectively, our system is the best.

Most people can get a pretty large number of interesting and diverse excursions in their lifetime without ever crossing the border, and it's cheaper and easier.

4) Pride, probably? I don't know how to answer this, because I'm not in that camp. One of the best and most interesting political discussions I ever had was with a lovely French man I met at the Louvre (who spoke better English than my Creative Writing professor, I might add.)

5) Elitism is not really frowned upon in America; in fact, it's highly encouraged. There is some jealousy-oriented anti-elitism in the right group setting (read: Reddit), but few would pass on the opportunity to rub elbows with the rich and famous and subtly brag about the experience to the ""lesser"" folk.

6) It depends on how you define ""the dream."" I think class movement is still very possible in America, and happens regularly. I've personally witnessed several friends go from a lower class youth to upper class adulthood, and drag their parents along with them. That being said, some of the non-financial ""dreams,"" such as freedom of speech and expression, the right to fair, equal legal treatment, and the capacity to enact lasting cultural change are seemingly reduced in recent years. But, then again, my cursory understanding of American history seems to dictate that it was never really that ""dreamy"" to begin with, in regards to these facets of American dogma.

Ultimately, the real issue with foreign understanding of America, I find, is that it is hard to understand just how ludicrously diverse we are. As a resident of the northeast, I can say with confidence that Alabama felt very much like a foreign country with regards to culture and tradition (and to some extent, even language, despite us both speaking English.) The same is true for Arizona, Florida, Pennsylvania and Idaho...

America is enormous and filled with people that have originated from a host of different regions, and the racial and culture infusion continues to this day. And a common regional ancestry has incubated hundreds of subcultures that have great differences from other regions of the country. This division has setup an almost animosity between the regions and a sense of cultural elitism (the northeast hating the politics and culture of ""the south,"" and vice versa, for example.)

Because of this tremendous diversity, it is a challenge to outline what it is to be ""American."" I liken it very casually and in non-binding form to the difference between the Cockney area of London and Wales; same country, tremendous cultural differences.

That said, I don't think these qualities are uniquely American anymore.

t3_k2ch2,0,c2h0k65,"1) America is a very large country. Generally comprised of 50 states. Some of these states are the size of two or three other countries. IE Texas, California, Alaska. Americans tend to travel allot between states. Most Americans can't afford to fly over seas, and it's considered a very big deal if we do get to do so. 

If the USA was set up like Europe, where each state was independent and required a passport to go across boarders, then many more Americans would have a passport. However, since there is no need for it to travel between states we don't get it until we need it to travel outside of the country. If you ever get the chance to travel around the States, you will see that each state is very different geographically and environmentally, as well as the people are very different from state to state. Texans are very different then new yorkers for example. 

2. Many Americans take themselves seriously because that's the way our country operates. You have to put in the work to get what you want. However, that doesn't mean we are humorless. In fact, American are some of the nicest and funniest people you will come across. However, we don't take kindly to people who attack us in any respect. So if you aren't serious and making jokes about our country we will laugh with you. Mostly because we know it's true and can take a joke. If you are outright slandering our way of life, we will get angry.

3) This is kind of a loaded question. The majority of African Americans come from low-income neighborhoods. The American economic system sometimes makes it hard for these people to build their neighborhoods up out of poverty. The people do what they can to thrive, even if that means committing violent crimes or selling drugs. It's not right, that's just the way things are.

4) Even though our country has problems, we still love it. Not every American is like this, most want to find solutions to the issues and quietly work to do so. Often the media portrays us as flag waving maniacs, and some of us are. That however is not the majority of people in the US. 

This is our country. It may not seem like much, but it's ours. We will protect it in word and in action. Just like the people from any other country would. 

5) Elitism is a word that was constructed for people who have pride in their status. Most Americans are middle-to-lower class working people. We hate the word elite because in our constitution it says all men are created equal. However, America is a very competitive country. We love to say we are the ""best"" at what we do. We love to challenge other countries to beat us. It may come off as arrogant, and for some people it is. It's a strange double-standard that the general American Public has. 

6) The American Dream isn't dead. Most people aspire to own land, work hard, and make enough money to raise a family and have some fun. The problem is the media. It portrays the ""New American Dream"" as getting rich quick for doing little to nothing.

If you asked a few randomly selected Americans if they had been out of the country and where, most would say Mexico, Canada, or possibly a more popular European country like France or the UK.

Also, as others have said, the US landscape is really varied, so there's tons of places to see within our borders too.

2: I don't think that's true.

3: Complicated socio-economic factors, as well as some lingering societal racism. Also, some laws are indirectly racist as well...for example, mandatory sentencing for crack cocaine (more commonly used by the poor since it's cheaper, who are more likely to be African-American than the middle class and the rich) is dozens of times longer/harsher than mandatory sentence for powder cocaine (more commonly used by the rich and middle class, who are more likely to be white than the poor).

t1_c2h0dj4,0,c2h0ldg,"&gt; So folger's nicely fine-grained coffee is almost guaranteed to taste bad?  

Well, yes but not necessarily because it's fine ground. The reason that Folgers probably tastes bad is that it is *pre*-ground. Coffee looses freshness like you wouldn't believe...literally 10 minutes after grinding the coffee will have lost a huge amount of the aromatics that contribute to a really great taste. The only way to avoid this is to buy freshly roasted, whole beans, and grind them yourself with a decent burr grinder (not a blade grinder). This is not as expensive as it sounds: you can get a really good hand grinder for about ‚Ç¨30 ($45, but you could probably find it cheaper). I'm told the [Hario Skerton](http://www.amazon.com/Hario-Coffee-Hand-Grinder-Skerton/dp/B001802PIQ) is very good, and if you enjoy coffee it's a great investment.  

The second reason it might taste bad is an inappropriate brew method. French press, pour over, or drip methods use a coarse, or extra-coarse grind. A fine grind in any of these will overextract the coffee, as described above.  
However, espresso machines, moka pots, and the aeropress all use fine grinds, and can produce wonderful cups. The aeropress in particular is relatively new, and extremely popular. It's easy to use, easy to maintain, inexpensive, versatile, quick, and makes a wonderful cup.  

But regardless of your preparation method, the first step in any good cup of coffee is good beans. You will not find these in a supermarket. Try local ""third wave"" coffee shops or roasters, or i you'd prefer to order online, try [Sweet Maria's](http://www.sweetmarias.com/index.php) in the U.S., or [Has Bean](http://www.hasbean.co.uk/) in Europe.

t3_k2ch2,0,c2h0m1m,"**Question 1.  Why don't you guys travel?**

I have a passport, and I travel. I think it's safe to say that at least half of the people here have passports, but to be honest there really is no need to have one. Up until recently, Americans could travel across North American borders without passports. Furthermore, most Americans travel to other states. Our states are bigger than many countries in Europe. For instance, from Oslo, Norway to Stockholm, Sweden is the equivalent of me driving across my state (and not even exiting the state). I live in a pretty small state, too.


**Question 2. I've heard that Americans take themselves very seriously. Even heard the US referred to as an 'irony-free zone'. Is this true? If not, why do people say this?**

I'll have to agree that Americans are pretty serious, but we joke a lot too. I think it's safe to say a lot of Americans have a sense of humor. Otherwise, why would we be on Reddit? ;) And I've never heard us called ""irony-free zone"", in fact what does that even mean? Irony and humor are two separate things... are they not? They can work together or be independent of each other, you can have something funny that is not ironic and vice versa. On top of all that, Americans love to point out irony. Ironic, isn't it?


**Question 3. Why are there so many African-Americans in jail?**

Sadly, this is because we have allowed our country to enable somewhat of a police state in which - instead of addressing issues like a doctor would cure a disease, we only treat the symptoms. Instead of rehabilitating criminals and fighting crime, we are throwing people in prison and arresting them everywhere we can. Prisons have quotas to fill, and they are privately ran and financed. What does this mean? Profits. More prisoners = more profits. Furthermore, we have the most prisons in any country in the world. It's not that black people commit more crimes than white people, it's that the justice system allows more black people to goto jail than white people. Also factor in the most common occurrences of crimes these people commit, white people are statistically less likely to be involved in gang activity or drive by shootings, things of that nature (and I hope that doesn't sound racist, but it is more of a statistical thing really). But I do believe our system is very flawed (and possibly racist).


**Question 4. You readily admit your country's short-comings among one another but when a foreigner says anything against the USA, Americans tend to turn ultra-patriotic and abrasive. Why?**

When we speak negatively of our own country, it is because we have actually lived through it and been here to see it and experience it for ourselves. Most of the time when people from another place talk about people from yet another place, they are wrong (or not completely accurate, at least). Do all British people have bad teeth and eat crumpets and drink tea all day? Do all Canadians wear flannel shirts, have a pet moose, and drink maple syrup by the gallon? Those are stereotypes. The majority of things people say about America aren't facts about our countries flaws, such as ""Oh the economy is bad why don't they make more jobs"" or ""Why don't they secure their own borders instead of fighting in the Middle East"", those are legitimate flaws to point out. Instead, the usual flaws foreigners point out about us are narrowed down to the simple minded ""Der Americans are stupid and fat and only eat fast food"" or ""Americans are too serious..."". And those are stereotypes. I have been to England, and I never expected the people to fit a certain set of standards that I assumed they would have. I never expected to see people looking like Austin Powers walking around. I just saw them as regular people, whether they were from America, or England, or Morocco. Not stereotypes.


**Question 5. Why is is that 'elitism' is frowned upon, but there are no qualms about claiming that the USA is the best country in the world?**

Just because we claim to be the best country around doesn't mean we are the best country that could possibly exist, ever. It just means people think our country is better than the ones that exist currently (except possibly Switzerland). Just like you mentioned we admit our shortcomings, we know things are wrong - but we are still a lot better off than 90% of the other countries out there

**Question 6. Does the 'American Dream' still exist?**

I think deep down it exists in all of us, but most of us have made our new and own independent dreams... but they are all still pretty much the same things; just instead of a white picket fence and a house with kids, it's just the act of being successful and making something of yourself.

t1_c2h0c9w,0,c2h0met,"&gt;Yes, Saddam was about as much a tyrant as Khadaffi, and Iran as much in need of an domestic uprising. My point is that the US attack on Iran did lack every imaginable support in international law, and did not have any connection to any popular uprising, which the case in Libya, with ongoing attacks on civilian (and other...) protesters had.

The fact that there wasn't an uprising occurring in Iraq *at that given point in time* should not matter though if we acknowledge that both are dictators and that their oppression alone is enough to justify their removal from power.

&gt;I consider UN as a whole as more than just the Security Council, which despite it's imperialistic control was rather hesitantly pushed into an intervention by international and Libyan popular protests.

What international protests?  From what I remember there was the UNSC members, the rest of Europe for the most part, and the Arab League who were clamoring for an intervention.  Many Latin American, African, and other Third World leaders were strongly against it.  Hmm, wonder why that might be?

&gt;ou can't really make the case for others than possibly the French having actively pushed the idea of an intervention in the beginning of this process - with the Brits and Italians guarding their current - not so socialistic - economic interests in Khadaffi, 

The British did actively push for this intervention though, they recognized the rebels before even the US did.  The fact that they have economic interests with Gaddafi does not mean they can't make the calculus that they stand to benefit even more from the rebels.  

&gt;Even the club of surrounding autocrats, with Khadaffi an active member, was definitely hesitant - the Libyan protests as a part of the ""arabic spring"" not being their cup of tea either. 

Gaddafi has never gotten along very well with the Arab League.

&gt;This does not imply that more than a minority of the Libyan opposition is democratic, or that everybody will be happy in Libya for ever. My only point is that any socialist glorifying Khadaffi because he is under attack by NATO has lost his political bearings.

No one is ""glorifying"" Gaddafi.  We are simply stating facts.  And the fact is that Libya under Gaddafi has had the highest HDI in Africa, a very strong and generous social safety net, and despite some concessions has generally not been as submissive to the West as his peers in the region.  Whatever his flaws, these are facts, and they all point to Gaddafi being taken out largely due to Western colonial interests.  The rebels are fractured and amorphous, but their official leadership at this point is thoroughly neoliberal.  This is another reason to support Gaddafi over a NATO-backed neoliberal insurrection, and I think any socialist who wants to rush to the NATO line and uncritically condemn the man, to the point of spending more time blasting Gaddafi than NATO imperialists, has most assuredly lost his or her political bearings.

&gt;Under the current realistic alternatives I can hardly see NATO as a worse partner for the Libyans than Khadaffi. Start with a basic body count: How many civilian Libyans has Khadaffi murdered? How many similar murders would NATO get away with without Arabic, European and American protests?

That's a good question: How many civilians *has* Gaddafi murdered in the course of this uprising, actually?  How does this compare to the rebels and NATO?  It is interesting how you phrase it as a rhetorical question when the fact is you yourself probably do not have a reliable number for either figure.  At any rate body counts are not the best way of answering this question, the best way is to look at the ideology of the two sides.  When you say NATO and the rebels present a better alternative you are literally saying neoliberal colonialism is better for Libyans than a state capitalist system with many flaws but also strong publicly-owned institutions.

t3_k2ch2,0,c2h0obr,"1. The short answer is this is a really large country, and it manifests in 2 ways:
* If we are paid well, it's often in a city far away from our place of birth.  Couple that with our lowest-in-the-developed-world vacation time, and we wind up using vacation to see family at holidays.
* The country is so big, and there's so much to see that many people die without having seen most of it.  Add in that traveling to see family eats up about half of our vacation, it's more rewarding to just go see the Grand Canyon than take a trip to Europe (or any other country) for a week.

2.  I don't think this is true.  I'd need an example contrasting behavior in other countries to understand the question properly.

We're very self-deprecating, but maybe you mean our attitudes towards our country?  In that, we are not so self-deprecating, it's true.  Why? I'm not sure I can say, but I'd suspect it has to do with the mythology surrounding our involvement in WWI and WWII.

3.  To be clear, the majority in prison is white just like outside prison, but the ratio of minority/black to white is higher in prisons than outside.

It's big business.  If we spent the money to educate everyone properly, our crime rate would go down, but that would be money put into the government.  Instead, we leave whole segments of society, the poor, without any options save crime.  Then we spend billions on private security and private prisons to house these people.  That money goes to corporations.

Ultimately, the problems the United States have, including prison populations, boils down to being the most wealthy country on the planet.  We have so much money concentrated at the Federal level that everyone's spending money in legal bribes to get a piece of the action.  So the people suffer.

4.  It's a good question.  I could answer by saying if your sister is a whore, you might get angry and tell your friends what a whore she is, but then if your friends call her a whore, you yell at your friends.

It's also difficult to take criticism from other countries because few of them understand the amount of corruption that our wealth and power bring.  It fees a little like if a rich person looks at a poor person and says, ""Why don't you dress better?""  There's often a lack of understanding involved in the criticism.

5. You know, that's much more complicated than the question suggests.  We dislike elitism intensely in this country.  Many of us also dislike hearing people call the USA the best country in the world.  However, patriotism is the opiate of the disenfranchised masses.  Fully half of the population live below our incredibly low standard of poverty.  These people may live a life comparable to some third world countries, but by God, they're Americans!

1. Yes, I'd say it's mostly because of the expense/there are so many places to go inside of the united states. I'm not sure what country you live in, but if you divided your country's area into the US's area it would probably make a little more sense. However, Americans also do a lot of travel outside the states, so it seems odd you've only seen 5. 

2. This is just not true

3. Read the other guy's link

4. I find this to be oddly true, and do it myself. I guess I just feel like many parts of the world have such a low opinion of Americans, and I didn't do anything to deserve that, so I get defensive about it. That's my experience. 

5. Well as a result of 2 world wars that went in our favor and a LOT of natural resources, we had a pretty dominant position in the world for decades. I think this has resulted in Americans having inflated ego's about their country, and the way history class is taught in this country does not help. Most people get one semester of world history(that still focuses mostly on the U.S.), and learn nothing about the history of other places. 

6. I disagree with this guy here, and must say no. The fact of the matter is that America actually has significantly less social mobility these days than many western European countries because of how our economic and tax policies have tilted the board for the rich. Most people who are willing to become educated can come here and make a life for themselves though, and I think that that is okay, just don't expect to become rich.

He said it wasn't uncommon for a perfectly normal, healthy, well-educated American to not own a passport. When I thought about it I realised that I've travelled to many countries all over the world and met under 5 Americans. Question: Why don't you guys travel?

America is fucking huge. If I want to go to the beach, mountains, or anything in between, I can usually do so while staying in the country. International travel is usually far more expensive (with the possible exceptions of Canada/Mexico), so it's more of a luxury than travel in general.

&gt;I've heard that Americans take themselves very seriously. Even heard the US referred to as an 'irony-free zone'. Is this true? If not, why do people say this?

Some do, some don't. I don't think it's very different from anywhere else. That said, I've never heard that we take ourselves especially seriously.

&gt; Why are there so many African-Americans in jail?

It started with crack in the 80s, and it's pretty hard to break out of poverty when everyone you know is also in poverty.

&gt; You readily admit your country's short-comings among one another but when a foreigner says anything against the USA, Americans tend to turn ultra-patriotic and abrasive. Why?

Sometimes my sister really pisses me off, and I'll vent to my other sister, but if a random guy off the street tells me my sister's being obnoxious, I'm going to defend her. In any case, a lot of the criticisms (at least the ones you hear about on reddit) are far too hyperbolic and often are off-base.

&gt;Why is is that 'elitism' is frowned upon, but there are no qualms about claiming that the USA is the best country in the world?

It's a remnant of our past; we still feel like anyone who is an ""elitist"" is like a European noble who doesn't have to work as hard to get what they want. Most Americans feel like you can and should do anything you want as long as you work hard, and when they feel like someone has it easier, the majority of people don't like it. As far as claiming the US is the best, I think it's pride rather than elitism. We feel like, for all of our failings, we still have a pretty damn good country, with a system of government that's designed to give us the power.

t3_k2ch2,0,c2h0qfv,"1.) I'm a perfectly normal, healthy, well-educated American and I don't own a passport. Unless we're actually traveling abroad, there isn't really much need for a passport. Most people either have driver's licenses or state-issued ID cards, which are accepted as valid identification. Once I get a decent job and make an investment in my future, I'm heading to Europe for all kinds of traveling. My parents and I always talk about travel plans and we're on opposite ends of the spectrum. I want to go see all kinds of places in Europe, they just want to see America. It's more important for my mother to see the Grand Canyon, Mount Rushmore, and the Alamo than it is for her to see the Eiffel Tower or Big Ben. 

I'm from the East Coast. The most popular vacation destinations for East Coast families are the beaches (New Jersey, Maryland, New York, etc). I think people are less interested in travel for the sake of sightseeing. Most people are going on vacation to relax. Why fly to Europe when you can relax at the Jersey shore for a much lower price point?

2.) I think individual mileage may vary on this one. I don't really know anyone who takes themselves all that seriously. I've always thought that humor was pretty well-integrated into our culture. Americans-at-large are fine getting on each other's case and enjoying a bit of self-deprecating humor; however, they don't like it when outsiders joke about them, even if its in a harmless manner.

3.) The drug war. Despite what Obama has recently said, the drug war is most certainly a racially-motivated movement.

4.) Americans think they're perfect. It's part of the education process. From a very young age, you're told about how great America is and so on and so forth. There's no real concentration on any of the negatives of our history. Things like the Civil War, Westward Expansion, and the Cold War, when discussed in an educational setting, are always glorified and prettied up. I didn't hear a teacher criticize America for the first time until I was in college. People don't want to hear the negatives about America from others because they think we're perfect. (Spoiler alert: we're not).

5.) I actually don't think elitism is frowned upon by the general population. America is a competitive place (we compete over the dumbest things. Suburban neighborhoods are the best example of this [the idea of keeping up with the Joneses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeping_up_with_the_Joneses) .) This is because people here are just too stupid to realize the double-standard. I would wager that this has a lot to do with how we value our entertainers. You won't hear the population-at-large complaining about actors making millions of dollars because they have some justification (""Celebrities deserve that kind of money."") And, again, we're basically taught that America is perfect from a young age. Instead of realistically portraying the country's role in the international community, kids are force-fed hero worship and blind devotion to a system that gets glorified from a very young age. 

6.) I think that depends on what part of the country a person lives in. I'm from Philadelphia. I would say that most people here don't dream of great prosperity. The reality of this city is as such: do what you need to in order to get by. My parents' generation watched the American Dream die in some places (Pittsburgh/Detroit, for example) while they were growing up. I think the previous generations have passed that experience on. Sure, everyone has a dream, but I don't really know anyone who expects to become a millionaire or be able to retire at 40. This is not to say that Philadelphia is a depressing place - it really isn't; however, I feel like people here are a bit more aware of their daily situation and tend to live ""in the now"" rather than in some fantasy. I expect things are the same in the Rural South and maybe the Midwest. I've never lived out on the West Coast, but people out there seem a bit more interested in ""American Dream"" -style thinking. American cities are in decline, government budgets, across the board (local/city, state, federal), are in crisis, most of our biggest industries (aside from the entertainment complex) are failing, and our government is gridlocked in a two-party-pissing contest. Call me pessimistic, but I think the ""American Dream"" (as you understand it) is dead. ",1,True,1314978629,,1,,False,[deleted],0,,1427550571,t1_c2h0qfv,0,t3_k2ch2,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,False
t3_k2ch2,0,c2h0qiq,"1.  I have a passport, but true, most people I know don't.  A close friend of mine comes from a well-off family.  After he graduated from college his father offered to pay for him to spend the summer traveling around Europe, he declined.  Said he had no interest in going.  Seven years later I still don't know what to think about that.  
Cost and vacation time are also a factor - I suppose when you're young, single, and have no children it wouldn't be that difficult to plan an extended vacation.  If you only have a few vacation days per year I don't think most people want to waste a couple of them in airports, on planes, trains, etc. just trying to get back and forth.  Especially if you've got kids.  It's cheap to fly domestically, international flights are $$$. 
2.  Maybe in the Deep South, but that's nowhere you want to be anyways.  Never experienced this myself.
3.  Very complicated issue.  Lots of theories out there.  I grew up in a middle class/lower middle class black suburb of a major US city.  Lots of black guys I went to high school with wound up in prison.  The place wasn't that urban, that big, or that bad.  The first time I had a gun pulled on me I was 12/13, one of the guys lived in my own neighborhood.  I google searched one of their names about a year ago, the first response was a mugshot, lol. 
4.  Probably a question best asked to the more close-minded of us who you won't find on this sort of board.  Any American using reddit is a bit more enlightened than the standard pick-up truck driving slack jaw.  Might try asking this one on a 4x4 or Diesel truck forum.  It seems to me that very few of the masses admit shortcomings about their own party.  We've become very divided over our two parties with each side more than willing to point fingers while admitting absolutely no fault of their own.
5.  That's funny, never thought of it, going to have to use that on people.
6.  Depends on where you live and who you ask.  I've got a lot of thoughts on this, so I'll try to keep it short for now.  I was born into a really poor life.  The first ""house"" my family had was a travel trailer (what English speaking Europeans call a caravan) attached to the back of my father's truck.  I would eventually start a business and by the time I was 25 I was making almost triple the average US household income.  Now I'm 30 and the business has failed, lol, so I'm back where I started.  My political views lean right, I vote Republican, but identify more with the Libertarian party.  I think there is an accidental ""war"" on the middle and lower class.  I think it's becoming harder to achieve success than it has been in the past, you need to be more highly skilled, work longer, and accumulate more debt.

I had two different professors from different parts of Africa who said nearly the same thing.  One was a black man from Western Africa and the other was an Arab from Libya, they both said something like ""Americans don't know how easy they have it, if you can't make it here, you certain'y can't make it anywhere else.""

&gt;Since the loans are not available to you otherwise, the loans themselves are not opportunity cost.

We've been over this. Taking on debt - what happens when one takes out a student loan - is costly in several respects. For instance, having to make debt payments prohibits you from investing in other things, paying for other services (healthcare), etc. Try and wiggle out of it all you want, this is called opportunity cost.

Americans pay taxes comparable to some Europeans countries, and then on top of that they must cover student loans plus intrest for themselves, not to mention health care and other services.

What isn't true? That people with degrees don't get paid more? Your wording was awkward.

For myself, I've noticed that since I got married I've put less effort into looking attractive towards others because I'm no longer looking for anyone anymore. I'm not saying I don't shower or look disgusting, but the effort level goes down.

&gt;It's pleasing to see an attractive girl when I imagine how I look from an outside perspective

Is this not dressing to please others? But instead of actual physical people, it's the hypothetical person that sees you?

&gt;I'm not saying that our perceptions of what is attractive aren't morphed by society.

I suppose in the end this is just an argument by degrees, since instead of ""morphed by society"" I consider to be ""all but wholly determined by society"" (see tanning in the US/Europe vs. whitening in latin America/India, african neck lengthing, lip/ear extenders, etc.).

I think the thing that's really wrong is that somehow a desire to please others is conveyed as a sense of weakness/poor character trait. In reality all but a handful of actions that we do are truly done for the self (education, health and hygiene come to mind). Everything else we do for others sake, we say please and thank you, we don't spit on peoples rugs, we go to the bathroom in the proper location, we wear clothes at work, etc. Why is attractiveness such a thorny issue?

You wanna go shopping, see a movie, eat out at various restaurants, see historic sites, stroll through botanical gardens, watch wild animals, ride roller coasters? You can do all that here too. Americans can travel without leaving the country. Also, until a couple years ago, we didn't need a passport to travel to another nearby country. That being said, I got a passport 2 years ago before vacationing in Niagara Falls, Ontario, and will likely use it again in a few years or so to visit some of my husband's relatives in Europe.

2- Americans are individuals. Some are more serious than others. Many are rarely serious at all. I'm not sure why people would say that, except maybe for the general idea of political-correctness and trying to not offend anyone.

3- I don't know. Possibly because they are more often poor or lower class, which may lead to crimes out of desperation or ignorance. 

4- Americans are patriotic and generally loyal, or at least they don't like being insulted. I think that applies to individuals too. I'm gonna be a lot less offended if I say to myself ""I should probably drink less pop so I don't start gaining too much weight,"" than if someone else says ""hey, you're getting fat because you drink too much unhealthy pop.""

5- Because we are the best! Really, though I think it's because America is so large, we tend to think of ourselves as kind-of separate from the rest of the world.

2) Not true

3) My opinion it's not a white/black thing. It's a poor/rich thing.

t3_k2ch2,0,c2h0tpb,"As someone born in a foreign country (Sweden), but spent most of my life in the US at this point, maybe this gives me some perspective from both sides:

1. American is HUGE. People don't need to travel outside of the country to experience significant geographical and cultural variation. California alone is the size of Sweden, and about 4x the population. Also, traveling is often more difficult and expensive for Americans. In Europe it's no problem to drive between countries, or take a short flight. In American, it's a 6 hour flight simply to go from San Francisco to Boston.

2. I don't think Americans take themselves very seriously as a rule. It's hard to generalize for a country with 350 million people.

3. I don't know. A historian would probably be better qualified to answer this. I would guess that because African Americans historically faced discrimination, this led to more poverty in African American communities, and there is probably a correlation between poverty and criminality. Just a guess.

4. I'm sure this would be true to an extent with most countries. If someone came to your country, hadn't spent enough time there to really understand it very well, and then decided to tell you all the ways in which your country was no good... I'm pretty sure most people would be at least somewhat offended by this.

5. I think when Americans use the term 'elitism,' it's often used to mean 'snobbishness' ... the idea that you are better than someone else. This sort of attitude should be frowned upon everywhere =). Americans don't necessarily frown upon successful people. For example, the Kennedies, Vanderbilts, Belmonts etc... where all 'elite' families that were generally highly regarded and romanticized by the public. It's just the idea of person snobbishness that Americans seem to dislike. Most people take pride in their country.. otherwise why live there? The US does have things to be proud of.. excellent higher education universities, successful research and tech enterprises etc. Perhaps we get a bit carried away with the ""USA #1"" stuff though

6. Not sure. If by 'American Dream' you mean ability for people to become successful based on nothing more than intelligence and merit... then maybe. I know people who came to this country without much, and were able to achieve success. I'm sure this can happen with most countries though. /shrug",1,True,1314979293,,1,,False,Tyrr,0,,1427550616,t1_c2h0tpb,0,t3_k2ch2,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,False
t3_k2ch2,0,c2h0ty9,"Didn't read others comments, that being said...

1) I think this is a geographic concern. For example, if you live in Europe, you can pretty much travel to any other country in Europe fairly easily. That is to say, if you live in France, and want to go to Germany, it's a matter of a car ride to get there. From the US, it's a long plane flight and a major ordeal. Driving there is out of the question of course. We travel to Canada/Mexico much more because they border countries We only border two countries, so we don't travel much outside of that because of cost/hassle.

2 &amp; 4 &amp; 5) Never heard this (irony free zone) before. I think all three of these questions come down to a matter of human condition, and have nothing to do with the USA in general. People in a specific group have privileges within that group that outsiders do not.  I find this to be true on many scales, both large and small.

For example, I might tell you that I have a weird family, especially my nutso Aunt, and my sister is annoying, so I punch her in the arm when she gets annoying. All three things are OK for ""ME"" to say, because I'm in the family.

Now... if SOMEONE ELSE (not in the family) was to say that we were weirdos, that my aunt is crazy, or punch my sister's arm... I'd kick your ass from here to the North Pole.  So yes, WE can say that the USA sucks because... but YOU can't say it, unless you are perhaps very good friends with the person in question. In all cases, you defend your country first, same as you defend your family (even if they are crazy and annoying).

3) Questions like this are trouble. The short answer is that the majority of AA still live in low-income areas and usually not exposed to higher education and/or good jobs. Any population of any race/creed will have a higher crime rate under these conditions. There are also significant cultural biases that tend to exaggerate these conditions (e.g. Gangsters  are viewed as heroes). 

6) Yes. Any person with a dollar in his pocket and a dream can still become an overnight millionaire in the USA. Freedom is still very free. A lot of things may suck about the USA, however the majority of things are done right. Our rights are usually protected, and we do have the power to change things through our vote and our voice (if we are too stupid to do that correctly sometimes is another matter).

t3_k2ch2,0,c2h0u2s,"Question 1 (Passports) America is huge and if we had borders like Europe we would have crossed 5 different countries within one day and need passport.   That is why many American's don't have passports.  Also, flying just isn't fun.  America has a lot to offer for vacations.  We have Hawaii (no passport required) mountain ski resorts, lakes, rivers for fishing, city life - Seattle, New York, San Francisco - Until just a few years ago, didn't need passports for Mexico or Canada either.  Do you realize how far we can travel without a passport?  But I'm sure the numbersof unpassported Americans will be changing. However with the economy the way it is, airport travel will likely be down.

Question 2 (Irony) I think that depends on which part of the country you are in.  Those whose ancestors freely came to America (I said freely) chose to do so knowing they were going to have to work hard to achieve their goals in life.  Its in our blood.  We do take some things quite seriously, those who have worked hard and accomplished much, deserve to be proud for what they've done.  Then there are those who in their blood, didn't acquire that drive.    Hispanics today are some of the hardest working people I've ever met. They come here freely to work to better themselves.
    
Question 3 (jail)  Its not because of prejudice, its a lifestyle and lack of one.  After the Civil War, too many didn't know what to do with themselves once on their own in this big country.  Look at how life was in Africa, how their societies were.  It was just different than American society.  Then those freaking ugly low income 20 story high housing projects were built.. and kids were brought in a neighborhood where things took a turn for the worse.  Life in the projects is dodging bullets, having drugs offered daily, plus the crimes against each other personally.   Is it a lack of self worth within that race?  It sure would be nice to change that.  On a side note, there are more blacks in college than in prison.  http://martinricard.com/blog/2010/01/14/more-black-men-in-jail-or-college-an-old-fact-revisited/

Question #4 (patriotic and abrasive)  Same way it is with in-laws actually.  You can't critize your brother-in-law in front of your mother-in-law, but its okay for your spouse to do it.  Family members (Americans) can criticize each other but it naturally puts a person on defense if someone else does it.  Same thing if you move to a new city and criticize it in front of someone who was born and raised there.  I'm sure if we criticized Canada in front of Canadians it would have same effect..  And if we criticized France in front of a frenchman, we'd be spit upon.  (Kidding)

Question 5 (elitism) Best country as in it offers more to people.  Back in the 50's we were in a competition with Russia.  Proving we were better and what other way than by T.V. and showcasing our warm loving families..   Aw c'mon.. who really lived like The Beaver or Dad Knows Best?  No one had families like that and we all felt bad because our families at home were not like the ones on t.v.  Now we have skank t.v. like Jersey Shore etc.   Yeah..  I'm not sure who perpetuates we are elite except slick advertisers.  So there are certain things America is best for..  if you are traveling and need help, the police, etc are generally not as corrupt as foreign countries police force.  Our publice bathrooms are way nicer than many foreigh toilets!  Usually.  America would like to preserve a decent way of life, but unfortunately rules and regulations, gangs and drugs and those who want to demoralize all that they can, are ruining life as we know it.
  
Question 6 (American Dream) I never understood this what this phrase encompassed. Maybe its a throwback term from the 'we are better than the Russian's' era. To me its all just a personal dream.  I'd think as long as anyone, anywhere (any country) has a goal and seek to achieve it, they are getting their dream. So -insert your own country- dream is universal.

The issue is common ground. If you're different, you will not have many friends, especially if introverted. It's not your fault, really, it's just the side effect of being different.

Okay, let's say for the sake of argument, that you are able to defeat the military forces of the Roman Empire. You deliver a sound kicking to their collective asses.  

Then what?  

The Roman Empire was not simply the army. The army held the peace, the *pax romani*, in order to provide political and economic stability for much of Europe, West Asia, and North Africa. Without the Legion, these areas would degenerate in short order to an unimaginable state of chaos.  

Roads would be unpatrolled and very dangerous, and so would the seas. Trade and economic prosperity would evaporate. City would turn against city, and local ""brushfire"" wars would pop up everywhere.  

There would also be complete political havoc. Hatreds and prejudices kept at a low simmer by Rome would explode. But everyone one be united in a  single, common hatred.  

You. You've created a neat little power vacuum, and everyone who has hated Rome for centuries will think that the only thing standing in THEIR way of seizing power is YOU. You will be beset on every side by enemies that will never give you a moment's peace.

While China has a higher population, more of that population is concentrated at the older end of the spectrum. India, on the other hand, has slightly fewer people, but those people are typically younger. I too see problems with the long-term fallout of the one-child policy, which does hamper replacement population as you said, not only because of the fact that they're not having children at replacement rates, but because so many more of them are male. Not to say that India doesn't have its own gender imbalance issues to work out, but it won't be hampered by the additional demographic hardship that the one-child policy will lead to. Still, this all depends greatly on India's ability to capitalize on these factors, which is not at all certain. I predict that if it doesn't, India will be a regional player, absolutely, but won't be able to effectively extend its power that far. If it does manage to take advantage of these factors, however, India has the potential to not only match China but exceed it.

- China will crumble on the heels of social inequality between the rich east and the poor west, and possibly get divided

- The EU will become more irrelevant in global affairs, because of its inability to coalesce into a single unit

- The Koreas will unify relatively soon, and become a global powerplayer, along with Japan and Turkey, by about 2050

- The next cold war will be between the USA and Russia, as the latter uses their energy and mineral wealth to re-exert themselves on asia minor and Europe

I am however a massive supporter of their domestic civil liberties platform.  On that basis:
 
The Lib Dem grass roots have been far, far too harsh on their party.  The Lib-Dems were bowled a tricky wicket.  They could hardly have supported a Labour coalition, the four nation resentment would have been far greater, or so I believe, than even the backfire from the Lib-Con coalition and it would have stalled the country when throttle, in any direction other than which we were headed, was needed with regards to the domestic and international economic crisis.

What they did do was to shunt the Lib-Dems into the power seat, even if it is half-cheeked on a crowded, unpopular bus seat.  They had to do something for the country just like Clement Atlee did on the brink of war by giving succession to Conservative Churchill.  It might have been an abrupt compromise but they're actually more in the public middle ground now and in a better position for the future, if they stop the in-house bickering, to actually influence and secure a few more of their own principled policies. 

Let's not forget that David Davis, a hugely popular Conservative and potential future leader, refused to take a cabinet seat on the grounds on Tuition Fees.  Clegg missed a trick by not pushing for broadening national referendums, concession on the EU which they could have put off until another term with referendums on this term over tuition fees, but disillusioned Lib-Dem supporters are really missing a trick by continuing to treat their one of two real inside men as a pariah. 

He made a really tough call in a really tough situation and he didn't take the best racing line, but they shouldn't throw him under the bus for it.

3. Africans have fewer opportunities for work, and are targetted disproportionately by law enforcement.  Though is a very complex situation, the root, fundamental cause is racism.

Many of the first settlers of the Americas were the younger sons of landed gentry in the Old world, as well as Puritan settlers who were largely outcast from Europe. In those hard times the best way to prove yourself was to be as productive as possible, and often times culture took a backseat. Fast forward 200 years, and the ideals of the French Revolution and the Enlightenment took hold in the 13 colonies, and a nation was founded on those principles (ostensibly), one of the reasons being that having a hereditary elite wasn't good for the State. In the 19th century, one of the primary forces in American Literature was the school of Transcendentalism, and authors like Ralph Waldo Emerson in his essay ""The American Scholar"" proposed the creation of a new kind of national Art, one that didn't glorify the upper classes but rather the common people and their honest struggle to survive. A lot of critics say the Walt Whitman would come to fulfill Emerson's dream. As a result, disdain for elitism has been ingrained in American culture for a very long time.

As for why we're so quick to defend it, it comes back to the fact that we *were* one of the two major superpowers on the globe for 60-70 years. Our country was able to do things no other one had done before (building the Atomic Bomb, the moon landing), or at least never done on quite the scale (the federal highway system, the Internet) and many Americans still take pride in that. **The idea is that we, as a country of equal citizens, did impressive things that we think justify the moniker of ""greatest country in the world"", so we collectively claim ownership of them and ascribe the title to ourselves**, rather than a small elite. If you listen to JFK's famous ""moon"" speech, he uses the phrase ""*We* choose to go to the moon"". So yeah, that's my explanation for the disdain of elitism and the glorification of our accomplishments.",1,True,1314980324,,1,,False,Urizen23,0,,1427550682,t1_c2h0ymd,0,t3_k2ch2,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,False

Geographically we have some awesome mountains, red rock/desert, and beautiful beaches. It didn't take me long to visit most of the prominent and remarkable locations.

Then you have culture. There is basically one culture in the US. If you think this is not true, I kind of doubt you have ever traveled outside of the country much. Cultures are markedly different as you cross borders in Europe and many parts of Asia. Hell, even certain regions within a country have wildly varying cultures such as in China.

To sum it up, I don't buy that there is so much to see in the US that you never ever need to leave it. I personally feel there has been so much amazing alien feeling stuff to see in other countries, that travelling to those areas completely blows my travels within the US out of the water. I do know that our elitism about being the best country on Earth, which I think is complete bullshit, probably tends to destroy the image of any other country or culture besides our own.

They never left the base in places like Japan or Germany because to them, these countries do not compare to what they have been raised to believe is the most awesomest ever. 

One thing I can say is that I am glad that hardly anyone in the US likes to travel. We are typically loud, annoying, and love to be aggressive when drunk and honestly, I have been embarrassed by fellow Americans while abroad more times than I can remember.

t3_k2ch2,0,c2h0zb9,"Q1) Will it is true that the US is very large so the need to have a passport is reduced because until post 9/11 we didn't need to have a passport to go any where in North America.  A US drivers license would get you in to Canada and Mexico.  We can travel to tropical climates to winter ski areas for vacations all without the need for a passport.  Once the regulations changed after 9/11 the number of people having passports shot up dramatically.  I for one didn't have a passport until my early 30's but had traveled to 30 of 50 US states.  Each of these states are larger then a European country.

Also, in my opinion, American's don't care to travel because we do not have the cultural interactions like Europeans or Asians have  Our nearest neighbors are Canada and Mexico.  Canadian's are not that much different then Americans.  Currently, a lot of the Mexican culture is being overlooked because of immigration issues in the US.  All of this doesn't give us a general feeling of wanting to explore other cultures.  

The last reason I will call the August factor.  The majority of Europe is encouraged to travel because you have extended time off.  I've been working for a world wide company for the last 7 years and I've found that Europe shuts down for the month of August.  By laws most countries require employers to give 4-6 weeks vacation a year.  You are also allowed to take 4 consecutive weeks off in August.  In contrast the average American has 2 weeks off.  With only two weeks you tend to take 2 one week vacations or a mix.  It isn't until you've been with a company for many years that you earn 3-4 weeks vacation.

Unless you happen to live near a border (which will only get you to Mexico or Canada), your only good option is to fly, and that's expensive.  You could spend a day or two driving, but time off is rare enough that most don't want to waste it on travel.

 Which brings us to point number two.  All the civilized countries in the world have state-mandated paid vacation time for full-time employees - all except the US.  Most give 4-6 weeks paid vacation per year to even the lowliest retail workers.  In the US, a good chunk the workforce gets no paid vacation time whatsoever.

No, it's not a strawman argument. It is the CORE of my argument. That as long as we HAVE a military we should have conscription as it acts as a ""safety valve"" towards politicians who may want to use the military for some unsavoury things.

The Swiss, btw, seem to agree with me as they still have conscription, a country that isn't really well known for it's military might.

&gt; German military leaders and the German government agree, as do the governments of a whole lot of other countries, probably including your own. 

I am German, so yes they would. I also know WHY they wanted to get rid of it. They did so because it seemed like easy brownie points towards people like you. It also gets around this messy little thing of the German constitution that prohibits the Government from deploying troops outside of German territory or within a defence situation within NATO.

The current ability for Germany to deploy troops in Afghanistan etc. is legal Gymnastics but they could never force conscripted people to go, they had to volunteer and not many did.

If anything this proves my point that a full conscript army is less likely to go visit other countries ""on a mission"" than an all volunteer army.

History, btw, would bear that out too. 

&gt; What does it matter? Do you want to turn it into an ad hominem? Counter my arguments or STFU, the fallacies in your comments are getting boring.

Has nothing to do with ad hominem, but I find it amusing how you try to tell me why Germany is doing what it's doing when you haven't the foggiest about German politics or the debates during the 90s and early 2000s about the whole conscription thing.

But hey, I am the one who is spouting fallacies here. Sure.

As for why I asked? Because I have the strong feeling that you hail from the anglosphere and there is a much different attitude towards military, military deployment and ""individual freedoms"" than in the rest of Europe.

I second what many others have said that a 4-year university education is worthwhile, but would say that whether you go the CC route or not depends a lot on your personality. If you love to party, being a freshman on a 4-year campus will be great for your social life but bad for your grades. If you're not a big partier, go the CC route and live off campus with other people your age -- rent a room in a 4 or 5 bedroom house with other CC and University students and you'll get plenty of social interaction, parties, etc.

From Catholic come all Protestants. All non-Catholic, non-Orthodox christians are Protestants. (ignoring the fact that the word Orthodox just means homogenous or established; and ignoring all the Protestants who don't like being called Protestants!) Of the first generation of Protestants come Lutherans (originally mainly north Europeans) and Reformed Calvinists (originally mainly central and western Europeans- Switzerland, France, Holland etc.). Also at this point come the Arminians.

Of the next generation from the Reformers come Anglicans, Episcopalians, Puritans and Anabaptists. From Arminians come Molinists.

Next Generation from Reformed Churches come Presbyterians, Congregationalists and Baptists. From the Anabaptists come the Mennonites.

Next Generation from Anglicans comes Methodists, who also draw from the Arminians (from Catholics). This generation of Baptists gives us the Particular Baptists and the General Baptists. From the Mennonites come the Amish.

Next Generation from Methodists comes the Salvation Army. From the Lutherans and Catholics particularly in Germany came the Liberals. From the Baptists came the Millerites. From the Millerites came the Seventh Day Adventists.

After this, many start using the terms ""Evangelical"" (read: looser on the doctrine, tighter on the holistic historical connections with all christian denominations); ""Fundamentalist"" (read: absolute doctrinal tenets and a big broadside against all other views, no matter where they came from); and ""Liberal"" (Bible not to be taken seriously, history with a pinch of salt) to describe themselves. They are not sects or denominations per se, but they became the lines people drew up and divided themselves on. (More often each other!)

I own a passport and have since I was 13.  I've traveled to four continents, and I'm working on polishing off the last three before too long.

I don't know where you happen to live, but let's compare the US to Europe.

With a car, in Europe you can go from:
Paris to london in 5-ish hours.
Paris to Frankfurt in 6-ish hours.
Budapest to Prague in 5-ish hours.

Of course. It is important to realize that hospitality to strangers is taken pretty seriously in the Arab world. I can't speak to Libya specifically, but it is certainly not an uncommon thing for foreigners (who are friendly enough to bother with the locals) to be invited to eat and sleep with people. It is a tradition that has shrunk away in Europe (in England, for example, where I am from) as we have grown more distrustful, but clings strongly in many parts of the Middle East.

2)  Depends on the context.  Many Americans fancy themselves as patriotic and when they perceive an attack on their politics/society by foreigners, might take umbrage initially, probably borne of the US being the prime mover in foreign policy since WWII and thus being the target of more criticism.  There are Americans who react similarly to perceived attacks on their religion or preferred sporting team.  I find this pre-disposition in foreigners as well, though perhaps Americans are a bit more touchy about religion and their role in foreign affairs.  Also if you can get the conversation past the initial feather-ruffling you'll find most Americans have deep criticisms of US politics/society/foreign policy.


3)  Socio-economic reasons and racial profiling as well as some laws that seem to be racist/classist (e.g. radical difference in how crack consumption/distribution is prosecuted vs cocaine).


4)  See 1).  I think it's also informed by the 1st amendment being sacrosanct and a combative/intrusive press.


5)  That's because we ARE the best, because Jesus was American.  J/K.  We like the idea of egalitarianism, but in practice we seem to like the rich getting richer, the poor getting poorer, limited socioeconomic mobility, and the idea that the privileged gets perks.  I think this bias transcends national boundaries though.


6)  I think 'American Delusion' would be more fitting, though mayhap I'm being a bit of a pessimist.  I think socio-economic mobility of Western Europe has surpassed that of the US primarily due to tax and social entitlement policy.

In 1961, construction of the wall began. 

It existed until November, 1989, when massive political changes in Europe (the fall of Communism) brought about the political, and shortly thereafter, the physical end of the wall.

Many might say it's because America is huge, but of course there are incredible things in Europe, Africa, South America, Asia and so on that don't exist in the US, so that seems like an incomplete answer.

2. I would say the opposite is the case. I think Americans are into being proper and having good manners, but joking around is very common.

3. Very tough question. A big part are laws, like high punishments for drug possession, that primarily hurt the poor and black Americans are on average poorer and less well-educated than whites. If one is to be fare, racism probably plays a part in it, as white cops seem to target young black men.

4. I think it's like a family member. You might say your older brother is an asshole, but if someone else says it you stick up for your older brother. Beyond that I think Americans might be more patriotic than some other countries, even if they do criticize America.

5. I'm not sure. Maybe it is because Thomas Jefferson, an influential thinker in American history, and many others thought the decadence and ceremony of Europe were unnecessary so they were less formal. Nonetheless that seems like an incomplete answer.

6. Not really. Many foreigners, like Indians are only coming here for degrees and going back home for work.

t3_k2ch2,0,c2h1bcd,"&gt; **Question 1. I was talking to a Canadian guy last night who studied in California. He said it wasn't uncommon for a perfectly normal, healthy, well-educated American to not own a passport. When I thought about it I realised that I've travelled to many countries all over the world and met under 5 Americans. Question: Why don't you guys travel?**

Because we're a lot poorer than mostpeople think. The income divide here is insane. We also don't get the same unemployment and work-leave benefits that Europeans do. Most Europeans are aghast when they hear Americans saying that their job gives them THREE WHOLE WEEKS for vacation a year (how grand!). We are very tied into our work-lives.

&gt; **Question 2. I've heard that Americans take themselves very seriously. Even heard the US referred to as an 'irony-free zone'. Is this true? If not, why do people say this?**

I'm giving a bit of a raised eyebrow here. One of the hallmarks of American humor is self-deprecation. We like to make fun of ourselves as a comedic outlet usually strung together with cynicism and bravado. 

That being said, I assume it's mostly around nonamericans that you would see the 'serious' behavior. There are a lot of negative American stereotypes that Europeans and Canadians seem to love but are mostly based on hate of our politicians (we hate them more, we're just too divided to do anything about it). This breeds a lot of defense mechanisms. I kinda assume whenever I meet someone from Europe he thinks I'm going to be a fat gigantic asshole who talks like a hick lost for twelve years in the ozarks with nothing but a bunch of backwards opinions.

&gt;**Question 3**. Why are there so many African-Americans in jail?**

RACISM = D. Basically the 'War on Drugs' has been co-opted into  a  racial enforcement. While drug use is the same in white, latino, and black communities, the drug laws and busts take place primarily in black communities and searches are typically conducted on racial grounds. I would recommend reading ""The New Jim Crow"" if you really want to understand where all of that is coming from.

&gt; **Question 4. You readily admit your country's short-comings among one another but when a foreigner says anything against the USA, Americans tend to turn ultra-patriotic and abrasive. Why?** 

I haven't noticed this, but reference the 'defensive' status I see up above. It's also something that is changing drastically in the generations. The older generations were spoonfed the propganda and fear campaigns of the cold war, and thus hold a very patriotic view. But the younger generation who is realizing that they probably won't get medicare, decent paying jobs, homes, or an affordable education are beginning to turn decidedly unnationalistic.

&gt; **Question 5. Why is is that 'elitism' is frowned upon, but there are no qualms about claiming that the USA is the best country in the world?**

This kind of behavior is generally seen as a bit... red necked, so it depends on the part of the country you're in. Some people have just never seen the outside world and know nothing else. Ignorance.

&gt;&gt; **Question 6. Does the 'American Dream' still exist?**

As in do people want it? Yes. As in a large number of people can get it? No. You can read other people's opinion here on the thread about the American dream, but you can probably see it's a pretty emotionally charged subject. The truth of the matter is that the 'death' (really coma) that the American Dream is in is one of the most uncomfortable facts for Americans of today to come to terms with ideologically, as it demands a painful shift in our nation's ideals and goals.

t3_k19mi,0,c2h1fg8,"Players are employees of the individual clubs whose contracts run for a finite amount of time, they have no contracts with the individual leagues. A player can be transferred against his will as little as your boss can ""sell"" you to another company you don't want to work for (legally, players can also buy themselves out of contracts that have been running for three years or longer for compareably small sums based on their current wages [Webster Transfers] but this rarely happens). The only reason money exchanges hands between clubs when a player is transferred is that the receiving club pays the old club a sum to compensate them for dissolving the running contract with the player - sometimes that sum is freely negotiable, sometimes the option to dissolve the contract for a certain amount of money is part of the contract itself (in Spain these options are customary), but a lower sum can always be agreed upon. If a club wants to get rid of a player because they don't want to pay his wages anymore, they can offer the player a compensatory sum to dissolve the contract themselves (e.g. when R√°ul moved away from Real Madrid, Real still payed him about ‚Ç¨2Mio to compensate him for the lower wages he would get at his new club). If the player is at the end of his contract there is nothing his old club can do to keep him from signing with another team.

However, for a player to be eligible to play in a certain league, the club has to register him for that league and this registration only works under certain conditions. First of all, if the player is out of contract, he can be signed at any point, but the European leagues are only open for registration of players who change clubs mid-contract at certain periods that are not consistent for all over Europe. For most of the ""big"" leagues (England, Spain, Italy, Germany etc. - France where off-key by a month a few years ago but are back to ""normal"" now) these transfer windows are July 1st until end of August and the month of January, but there are other leagues (Russia, Norway, Sweden, Finland) which have different transfer windows due to the fact that their leagues start and end at different times due to their colder winters. The only transfer window that is of importance is the one of the club the player wants to join, meaning that a player could leave an English club and go to Norway if the Norwegian transfer window is open even if the transfer window in England is already closed.

Secondly, a player can not play for more than two clubs per season. Let's say a player plays the first game of the season for his old club, but goes on to move to another club in the pre-season transfer window. Things don't work out at the new club, so he wants to leave for yet another club in the mid-season transfer window. Technically any club can sign this player now, but this is unlikely to happen since they won't be able to register him with their league until the beginning of the next season because the player has already played for two clubs that season.

When it comes to registering the player for a European comeptition (Champions League/Europa League) they may not have taken part in that competition with another club in that half-season yet. So if a player plays the CL-qualifier with his old club and then moves on to a new club that has already qualified for the CL, the new club won't be able to register him for the CL until the next half-season even though they are able to register and play him in their domestic league.

Also, the FIFA has to declare a club eligible to sign new players in the first place - it's very rare that they do not declare a club eligible for that, but it does happen. FIFA previously banned Roma from signing new players for two consecutive transfer windows as punishment for encouraging players they were interested in to break their legitimate contracts with their old teams.

Loans mean that a player gets to register a player for their league even though he is still under contract with his old team. There can be different reasons for clubs and players to agree on a loan - for example, if a young player is already too good to profit from playing for the reserve team but yet not good enough to play constantly for the first team, a club might be inclined to let the player register with a team that will give him regular first team football. The reason for a loan could also be that a player hasn't gotten regular first team football in a while or might have a reputation as a trouble maker, so it will be hard to convince any potentially intrested clubs to sign the player on a permanent deal until they know how well he will perform/behave in his new club - these temporary deals most often include an option for the new club to make the deal permanent for a sum previously agreed upon.

Also, there are cases in which players are not under contract with a club, but with a third party (this is fairly common in South America with Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano being examples for players who started out in Europe while being under contract with a private company - though they were registred as players for West Ham, the company could and eventually would choose to sent the players to other clubs without West Ham being able to do anything about that or getting compensated for the loss of ""their"" players) or two different clubs only one of which gets to register their employee as a player for the current season (this is rather common in Italy, but unheard of in most other European leagues). These players are basically on different loan deals until their contracts with their employers come to an end.",1,True,1314983726,64,1,,False,Brotaufstrich,0,Werder Bremen,1427550898,t1_c2h1fg8,0,t3_k19mi,soccer,t5_2qi58,False

t3_k2ch2,0,c2h1hn9,"Question 1. I was talking to a Canadian guy last night who studied in California. He said it wasn't uncommon for a perfectly normal, healthy, well-educated American to not own a passport. When I thought about it I realised that I've travelled to many countries all over the world and met under 5 Americans. Question: Why don't you guys travel?

Answer: we do.  Don't know about you, but I've met plenty of Americans when I travel.  It is, however, harder for Americans to go to Europe - it's too damn far from here.  Think about how often your average European goes to the US - it's hard to make that kind of trip on a regular basis.

Question 2. I've heard that Americans take themselves very seriously. Even heard the US referred to as an 'irony-free zone'. Is this true? If not, why do people say this?

Answer: not sure, but they may be being sarcastic when they say that.

Question 3. Why are there so many African-Americans in jail?

This one calls for a long, long essay - but the tl:dr would be centuries of institutionalized racism, legacy of slavery, rebellion against social norms considered ""white"", gang affiliations, and disproportionate punishment for crimes typically committed by African-Americans.  

Question 4. You readily admit your country's short-comings among one another but when a foreigner says anything against the USA, Americans tend to turn ultra-patriotic and abrasive. Why?

Answer: I can make fun of myself, but if you make fun of me, it's offensive.  Same way as you can criticize your own country, but might bristle when someone else criticizes it.  

Question 5. Why is is that 'elitism' is frowned upon, but there are no qualms about claiming that the USA is the best country in the world?

Answer: ""elitism"" in this context implies educational/social-class elitism.  Many Americans do not like that because it would mean that some people are better than others - which contradicts their ingrained idea that all people are equal.  That's the kind of ""elitism"" that is frowned upon; American exceptionalism (i.e. ""the USA is the best country in the world!"") is just fine with most Americans.

Considering that the USA was the only country willing to accept me and my family in our flight from religious persecution, I have at least some sympathy for the American exceptionalist viewpoint.  

Question 6. Does the 'American Dream' still exist?

Answer: It did for me and my parents.  22 years ago, we came to this country with nothing but the clothes we were wearing, no English, and no jobs.  Now, my parents own a prosperous business; their house is paid for; they live a very nice life.  My small business is growing, and I, too, have a very nice life.

t3_k2ch2,0,c2h1hpv,"Answer 1: I have had a passport since I was 13, and love to travel.  But America itself is quite large with plenty of places to visit, and it can be expensive to travel to outside of say... NA/Europe.  A lot of us are ignorant and uninterested in other cultures.  Leads to us being less likely to travel.

Answer 2: Irony free?  I see hipsters all the time.  The U.S. has been the most powerful country for a while (I don't see that lasting long given the anti-reason/anti-science/anti-education forces gaining steam)... a lot of the patriotic rhetoric helps it go to some people's heads.  Also, when we travel abroad we get shit on by people left and right (even for stuff Canadians do/say, as they are usually identified as Americans... which made me laugh at past personal experiences when this came up in 'In Bruges').

Answer 3:  Combination of bad legal policy (drug policy especially), some discrimination, and what most people don't admit - certain negative aspects of African American culture that have persisted in many urban areas.

Answer 4: Personally, I defend general attacks on America that really don't hold up... the country is fairly diverse from state to state and region to region.  I find a lot of foreigners just jump on the hate-America bandwagon, but tend to not really know what they're talking about.  I own up to our faults... like the fact that Sarah Palin, Rick Perry, or Michelle Bachmann could even be considered remotely viable candidates for office.

Answer 5: Because in America ignorance is celebrated by a large percentage of the population now... just look at those who can't find Iraq on a map, don't believe in evolution, etc...

Answer 6: Aspects of it maybe.  Education is becoming more and more difficult/costly for everyone to get access to, and I feel that our quality of education is slipping (though still better than most countries I've had exposure to).  Our high school level education is crap though in my opinion.  Long term, I think this will work against us.

t3_k2ch2,0,c2h1hyz,"1 - The US is an incredible place to travel around. It has safe, cheap and easy independent road travel. The geography and variety are incredible. The people are not homogeneous: New Orleans is quite different to Seattle, probably in a  way that is underestimated by foreigners. The culture is obviously  not as diverse as you'd find by traveling internationally, but there's enough diversity to be interesting unless you demand extremes. You can and will have a good time culturally as long as you don't spend the whole time in the Raddison in Orange Country (and even there you'll have great personal service that is a vacation in itself to Europeans used to sulky waiters and desk staff).

Physically, the US is incredibly diverse and frequently extremely beautiful.  From the south west deserts to the Smoky Mountains to the beaches of Hawaii, with unique spots like the Grand Canyon. If you're looking for landscape and outdoor stuff, you can spend your whole life here.

If you like to see some deep history (more varied than aboriginal Americans) and particularly old architecture and cities, you need a passport. I love American traveling, but I need a fix of European capital city every now and again. Of course, this is very expensive and out of reach of most Americans just as San Francisco is out of reach of most Europeans.

If they are not wealthy, or they place higher utility on natural than cultural tourism, Americans have what they need right at home. 

Also, even top-20% income Americans often have miserably little vacation time from work. Losing two days of your one-week summer vacation in travel doesn't look so good.

(I'm a Brit now in BC, Canada and am lucky to travel for work frequently)

t3_k2ch2,0,c2h1n9q,"1.  Americans travel--just not internationally.  Look at a map.  The contiguous United States is *huge* and boasts a wider array of ecosystems and cultures than most other countries.  Further, unlike Europe, we don't belong to an economic/political block that allows for easy travel.  Getting out of the US is difficult for a number of reasons, including the aforementioned, and the fact that most other countries require travel over water--you need to get on a plane or a boat to get there, and that gets pricey.  Lastly, an anecdotal observation that it's not uncommon for a specific group to not have a passport isn't an indication that Americans generally don't travel.

2.  I don't find that to be the case at all.  My friends and I are extremely sarcastic/enjoy irony.  I couldn't tell you why other people believe this to be true, you'd have to ask those who assert it.

3.  This is an incredibly complex question, and there is no single accepted answer.  There are volumes of sociological research on the over-representation of minorities (primarily African American and Hispanic males) in the prison population.  To begin with, we should start with the fact that America has a great love affair with prisons--a full 1% of the US population is behind bars.  Beyond this, factors like latent or overt racism, disproportionate representation among the poor, disproportionate representation in urban environments, and cultural differences all add to the likelihood of African Americans being arrested, convicted, and receiving harsher sentences.  There are many studies that demonstrate that an individual being impoverished, un- or undereducated, and growing up in a single parent home are actual more effective indicators of the likelihood of ending up imprisoned than being African American.  It's simply the case that these factors tend to be more prevalent in the African American communities.  If you're really interested, I'd recommend doing some searching via Google Scholar.

4.  I don't know that this is the full truth.  I think part of it is the approach others take.  Further, as other posters have mentioned, this doesn't seem to be unique to Americans, but a general response to a perceived attack.  Someone attacks you, you become defensive.

5.  Elitism, as thrown about in the US, tends to be about the idea that Cultural Elites do not adequately represent the interests of average Americans because they cannot fully understand their lifestyle.  This concept is very different from being 'elitist' in the general sense.

6.  There is much argument over whether or not the American Dream has existed for the majority of US history--most would argue that it was never a possibility for the majority of Americans and was instead truly only available to middle class white americans and minority groups that are considered ""white"" to a certain extent (primarily Jewish populations, certain Asian subgroups, and certain Hispanic subgroups [namely, Cubans]).  America does allow for upward social mobility in a way many countries don't, but it also allows for extreme disparities in economic distribution in a way many countries don't.",5,True,1314985254,,5,,False,bears184,0,,1427551000,t1_c2h1n9q,0,t3_k2ch2,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,False
t3_k2ch2,0,c2h1nzx,"1) We're really uneducated and don't like foreign people, foreign food, or foreign experiences. 

2) Yes. I can't find the poll, but I read once that when polled about whether or not they thought they were someone important, something like 20% of teenagers in 1950 said yes. In that same poll today, something like 85% said they were someone important. That pretty much sums it up.

3) a) Black people are oppressed and poor. [25.8%](http://www.infoplease.com/spot/bhmcensus1.html) of African-Americans live in poverty vs. [10.8%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_American) of white Americans. Even having a [""black name""](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/29/national/main575685.shtml) means less chance of advancing in the workplace. Low income means greater crime. Crime means jail.

4) We are a great country. After spending time in Europe, I must say, there are some real fuck heads out there. Seeing how women are treated around the world is pretty sobering. That being said, we're violent, dumb, and fat, so I think I'd still rather live in Europe.

5) Hypocrisy is a deeply rooted American tradition. 

6) Yes. It's just that dreams don't come true. The only way to win in America is to figure out a way to scam people out of their money or entertain them. From finance to IQ tests, scams are pervasive. In entertainment, it's the National Football League and drugs. No one wants to invest in things that make things better or more awesome. 

I think a great deal of what this comes down to is this: We're fucking lazy. Most people I know don't actually want to *do* anything - they want to get wasted on a beach with a sexy lover and live out their days staring at sunsets. The only ambition they have seems to stem from that desire - get money, get sexy lovers, get beach, get drinks with umbrellas, be happy. Or the other group that thinks the only way to happiness is a few kids, a house, a dog, and a quiet life in the suburbs. In America, being a parent is an ""accomplishment,"" not unlike finishing college or owning a company. I know very few people who think, ""I want to revolutionize X industry and transform people's lives."" Maybe people have some half-assed idea for a product or service that could actually improve things, but no one ever does anything with them. I posted a thread about high speed rail a while back and a lot of the comments were like, ""fuck trains, i got me a car."" Instead of trying some new (better) way of traveling, they'll stick to the old way. Lazy. Hell, we're even too lazy to vote. We have so very few genuine moguls - people who want to be the head of an empire for the sake of the people and not themselves. If you just want to be Steve Jobs so you can sit on a beach all day, you don't actually want to be steve jobs.

I know people are going to jump on me that they're actually to ""busy"" - but from what I see, people don't know what busy means. I worked two jobs, took 20 credits in college, and still had time to make music, draw, write, and watch basketball. Oh and for a while there, I didn't have a car, so I rode my bike 20 miles (that's like 32km) a day. 

So it's not like all Americans are that way. It's just that a lot of our middle class is that way, and it's causing their slow decline to lower class. The mechanism for advancement is there, but no one is going to hand you something, which is something American's have a lot of trouble with. And that's not a swipe at liberals (I am a liberal). I think the biggest thing is, even if you had someone an opportunity, they're too lazy to take it. That's a problem.

Since 2008, the libertarian movement has inspired many young Americans who are disenfranchised by a tough economy and demoralized by the dual-party system to seek an alternate route in their political ideology. They're a crowd of socially liberal, anti-war (drug and terror), anti-government infringement ""rebels"" who believe in little government oversight in the discourse of business. As a progressive, I'm petrified by that thought: it's wholly idealistic, and even the most elementary of hypothetical examples yield some terrifying outcomes for those of whom that are not conditioned to being big entrepreneurs or have rich parents who give them good education (we see it partially manifested now, Ron Paul calling for ending FEMA, after it devastated Northern NJ, where I'm from; the repeal of Glass-Steagall under Clinton and it being conveniently omitted from any serious discussion about what's going on). Moreover, it showcases a terrible lack of knowledge on innovative development in the United States - they've dominated the narrative to suggest that government hampers innovation when in reality, it was the Military-Industrial Complex which has effectively created most of the major inventions (or contributed to them significantly) which our private sector utilizes today (not that I like the Military-Industrial Complex). Broadly, I'd like to know what you think of the philosophy AND the movement itself. Is it reasonable? What would it yield if applied today (i.e., if Paul becomes president)? 

Secondly, a Goldman Sachs memo was leaked yesterday to the WSJ, which suggested that the European banks are going to need a $1tn ""bailout"" to ensure that bonds are issued and liquidity is available. 

1) Do you think the Goldman assessment is accurate?
2) Assume it is. What happens if the United States doesn't bail out European banks?

1. Most people I know don't own a passport. I do and my wife does, but out of all of the people I know, I think only 4 or 5 people have ever been outside the country. Most people just can't afford it. I wish it was more like Europe where you can buy a train ticket and travel through a bunch of countries for like 100 euro. But for Americans, going abroad is a luxury.

2. Some do, but most don't. I think the level of stress and depression for most Americans is pretty high, and it seeps into every aspect of our lives. It's easy to lose our cool over something simple, but most times I feel like people would prefer to joke around and laugh at things than get mad over them.

3. Socially and economically the lower income neighborhoods are places of hopelessness, which breeds apathy, greed, and violence. This is true of all communities of various cultures and races, but I think there are more people in poor black communities that actually embrace the culture of violence and greed as the best way to live their lives.

4. I think this is more true of the internet than in real life. I've visited Western and Eastern Europe, Japan, the UK, and people have asked me about our short-comings and they are surprised when I don't defend our country or our government's actions. Some things are great about America and some are not so great, but that's true of all countries and I think that's where we can find common ground.

5. Are you saying the US *isn't* the greatest country in the world? Seriously though, everyone wants to think that their home is the best. I live near Philadelphia and have to listen to people from Chicago, Dallas, and Boston tell me all the time why their cities and/or states are better. I think Americans have a lot of hometown pride that is unique to our country because every state, and sometimes every city, seems to have its own culture. Also, I think it'd be hard to prove any one country can be the best in the world.

6. Yes, and it's for sale to the highest bidder. For many people in my generation (I'm 33), I think it will just be that - a dream, and it will get worse for the next few generations. I honestly believe I'll never be able to retire, will never be able to pay off the mortgage on my home, and will have to struggle my entire life. My parents had it tough but eventually overcame, as did their parents. But things are so bad economically now, that I sometimes wish things would collapse just to bring us all down to the same level for once.

""Developed countries"" is a synonym for Western cultures. That is, European and North American nations with populations originally descended from European peoples. Western people being chronically ""unhappy"" boils down to different understandings of how to become happy, and what it means to be happy.

Most Western nations are fueled by an economic system that prizes the individual's achievements above the group. This system reflects cultural values easily visible in common aphorisms: ""reach for the stars"", ""achieve your dreams"", ""be all you can be"".^1 

See also, for instance, the American ideal of the entrepreneurial businessman who starts from scratch and builds a successful corporation. Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffet, Jay-Z etc. American culture loves these figures, and they are well-represented in our cultural consciousness, because they perfectly embody the archetype of the Ideal Individual.

Westerners also live in a heavily media-saturated world. Values of the masses are very efficiently distributed to every corner and subculture. Dissension from the cultural value of individualism is ridiculed at every opportunity. The result is that most young people grow up with the idea that being self-sufficient and independently achieving wealth and/or fame for yourself is the number one goal above all others. Westerners want our own house, our own car, our own private vacation home, our own computer. Relying on others for these things is shameful and shows a lack of initiative. Weirdly, this quest to self-sufficiency tends to lead to bold economic developments and a large, diverse economy, so the values propagate themselves.

But there's a tradeoff. The focus on the individual tends to cause a certain loneliness. This loneliness is hard to pin down and tends to be politicized to death. Westerners are competing against each other for jobs, for sustenance, for the opportunity to play out their own psychodramas in the wider world and ""get a piece of the pie"". Families spend less time together and live farther apart. Americans typically only see their extended families at major holidays, and it is not uncommon to rarely visit parents and siblings.

The experience of being happy correlates closer to ""being surrounded by friends and family who love me and who I can depend on"". But Western culture offers the definition of ""being able to depend on myself for all my needs"", or, even worse, ""being able to get everything I want."" 

The latter two are great for driving an economy, but they don't work well for our psychological well-being. Human beings are fundamentally group dwellers. We are only content when we are able to care for one another. It's in our nature.

The attitude of Canadian companies now have the Americanized ""well, everyone else is doing it, so I have to do it too!"" excuse. Have to be competitive! Few are even attempting to display a facade of pride or integrity anymore. Why bother, when your catchy marketing campaign is all about [COMMUNITY! GOOD SERVICE! TOGETHER IS AMAZING!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE0rSA-4hKM)

It's a brilliant strategy, really. Slowly dismantle the Canadian roots of a company, give up the responsibility of being a good employer, don' think about the impact on the communities who rely on these jobs, and just spend money on advertising that promotes you are the exact opposite.

Why have legitimate values and responsibilities that cost money, when you can simply BUY and CREATE your own image? 

Many European countries are trying to bring jobs back to their own people. This does not necessarily ""doom"" the company to an inevitable destruction. I believe that many Canadians would choose to support companies that kept jobs in Canada, over their competitors who put profits above the lives of people. There are so many young people who would LOVE a job in a call center in this terrible economy (I'm one of them.) 

Imagine if companies realized this, slashed ridiculous advertising budgets, and tried to bring jobs BACK into Canada. Then they would have to actually compete with having more ""Canadian values"", instead of ""who can come up with the most catchy brainwashing marketing campaigns"". Companies that continue to ship jobs overseas need to be shamed and boycotted. We don't have to take this shit. We don't have to follow down the same crooked road that has led America to ruin. We can look to other countries that are trying to change the impact of outsourcing on its citizens.

While this might be true in relation to foreign aid given directly from the state (not taking into account our military commitments that have and continue to provide millions of non Americans with the luxury of freedom and the ability to breathe [see Korea]).

t1_c2gns08,0,c2h2duo,"&gt; For westerners anti-Zionism doesn't come from antisemitism but rather out of a sense of solidarity with a disenfranchised people

I disagree. Before the late 60's, nobody even talked about the Palestinians. Hell, the European left *loved* Israel, both for being a plucky socialist state, and due to some white (Christian?) guilt. The Scandinavians that are now calling for harsh boycotts against Israel, used to volunteer in the Kibbutzim.

The main instigator of Western left-wing anti-Zionism, is a massive campaign by the Soviet Union and the Arab states in the aftermath of the six-day war. Just about every anti-Zionist talking point (""the Israeli aggressors"", ""Zionism is racism"" , ""Israelis are Nazis"" and so on) comes from Soviet propaganda. The Soviets were experts in subverting liberal rhetoric for their cynical geopolitical aspirations.

As for anti-semitism, I agree that's not the cause, but it's a *very* powerful leitmotif. The Soviets had a rich history of antisemitism to draw on for their anti-Israeli propaganda, and they used it extensively. Later, the same kind of European (Russian, really) antisemitism was adopted by the Arabs, that had no such traditions of their own, and unfortunately, by some of the western left that should really know better. See how disturbingly popular are ancient antisemitic myths on reddit - the obsession with hidden Jewish conspiracies, the Jews controlling the USA, the world economy, the media... Not so long ago, this kind of talk was taboo outside of Neo-Nazi circles.

&gt; These anti-Zionists also more often than not don't advocate ""kicking the Jews to the sea"" but rather creating a Palestinian state in the west bank and Gaza

If that's what they think, then they have no idea what ""Zionism"" is. First of all, Zionism comes in many forms, including a left-wing liberal one. Second, the vast majority of the Israeli Zionist political spectrum, from the liberal Meretz and Labor, to the far-right Israel Beitenu, supports the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza. Would you call Lieberman, or for that matter, Sharon or Rabin anti-Zionist?

t3_k2ch2,0,c2h2dy6,"I'm going to answer these and not even read the other questions.  Don't want to contaminate *my* answers.  If background helps you understand my answers, I am a 4th-year college student in Oklahoma, majoring in physics.  Certainly the people I hang out with are a tightly-selected crowd, but, I think my answers would be as legitimate as any one other American's.

**Answer 1.**  *Why don't you guys travel?* We do, it's just that most of us do it here.  Remember that the Lower 48 is roughly the geographical size of, well, Europe.  Just this summer I took two trips and put about 5000 miles total on my car from them.  I don't commute, so, almost all of those miles are from the vacations.  It does blow my mind that people can be happy commuting and wasting 2 hours *every day* in their cars on the same old highways.

So that said, we do travel, but travelling internationally is *expensive*.  First off, because it's international, there's not so many excuses to go - there are plenty of conferences and attractions in the US, and, most people anywhere aren't likely to apply to foreign universities or jobs.  Second, passports are expensive (they're at $180 now right?) and international airfare isn't cheap either.  I have gone abroad but I just let my passport expire.

**Question 2.** *Why are Americans so serious?*  Some others are probably going to deny this, but yeah, I would say that we are a pretty serious nation.  There are lots of people who are at least moderately religious, so, you can't joke about God.  There's also a lot of people, whom I know at least, who have a pretty Puritan work ethic.  It's not even a ""well one day I'll get my piece of the pie if I keep working hard"" thing - people just believe that working hard is a Good Thing.  I don't claim to know where that comes from, or really if it's different than other countries.

**Question 3** *Why are there so many black people in jail?*  We have come a *long* fucking way, but remember that for the majority of black people in the US, as short as 50 years ago, their parents and grandparents weren't legally allowed to vote, eat with white people, go to the best schools, get certain jobs, and so on.  Pockets of *wildly* discriminatory America still exist today, and I don't just mean lone skinheads, but, realtors who won't sell to minorities; city schools which are as segregated as they were fifty years ago due to white flight; racist cops... it's all at least technically illegal now but there have always been people who the law doesn't do much to stop.  I don't want to paint the picture that all of America is racist, because it's absolutely not, but if 1 out of 50 people who *you* met treated you like shit, you'd be worse off too.

**Answer 4.** *Why do Americans try to put on being uber-patriotic to outsiders?*  For every legitimate expression of patriotism I hear, I also hear another five tongue-in-cheek ones.  As to the serious expressions, I think it's just simple psychology - they are trying to defend what makes them different from you.  I wouldn't read anything in to it.  I would say that most of us understand, at least dimly, that plenty of other countries have better healthcare, or education, or economies, but if we still think the US is better it's because they're not better enough or that our priorities are just different.  As an example, lots of European countries ban hate speech, and thus Germans and French don't have to put up with neo-Nazis doing pathetic rallies down the street.  I would *much* rather prioritize freedom of speech, even though in this instance it just enables people to loudly be stupid and threaten everyone else.

**Question 5** *Why is elitism frowned upon, but USA #1?* Elitism is frowned upon, but if there's the perception that you worked to get where you are, there's a lot of leeway.

**Question 6** *Does the 'American Dream' still exist?* This is pretty much every American novel, film, song, or debate.  At the risk of being exceptionalist, I would say yes, but careful not to think that ""Everybody getting a suburban house and 2 cars and 2.4 kids"" is *the* American Dream.  In the sense that many of the present generation are still growing up with big dreams, and also some of the ambition needed to pull them off, a firm yes.  Also there's still millions of immigrants, and my own communities even are visibly different ethnically than they were when I was very young.  I think that flux is a huge part of ""America"" if you will.

Batman:AC, Skyrim, BF3, MW3, Stronghold 3, Shogun 2, Civ V (on release), etc. Even the Deus Ex list price on Amazon if $50; Deus Ex is $50 on Steam! I also love your ""don't look at Steam prices"" maneuver.

I dont know about the US but in EU console games cost 60euro, pc games can always be found for 35euro brand new. All these games that you wrote could be bought for 35euro on launch. Let's take a look at amazon.co.uk(prices converted to US $ for your convenience)

**Skyrim**

63$ for 360

45$ for pc

**Batman AC**

61.4$ for 360

42$ for pc

**Battlefield 3 limited edition(it is cheaper than the non limited one, go figure)**

63$ for 360

48.48$ for pc

**Modern warfare 3**

69.65$ for 360

56.6$ for pc

---------------------

These are just the games that you wrote. Bf3 and mw3 are known to always be insanely overpriced for the pc. As you can see, the price difference of deus ex isnt the exception, it is the rule. In fact it is almost impossible to get discounted new console games, since prices almost never differ from the suggested retail price. On the other hand on pc games, the price can differ hugely between stores, especially online stores.

I used amazon.co.uk as an example, even though it isnt ideal. I have found bf3 for pc only 38$ elsewhere for example.

&gt;Not if you use Steam, or D2D, or any other digital distributor, and not if the boxed games need to register on Steam. Not sure about GFWL.

Noone is forcing you to buy them from those services. In fact as i mentioned in my previous post, it is often much cheaper to buy them from a retail shop. Also console games have started including ""1 use"" codes to limit used games' marketability.

&gt;I also love your ""don't look at Steam prices"" maneuver.

Games on steam are insanely expensive. Like retardly expensive. Steam used to have identical prices for all countries and charged you in $(and added VAT when necessary). Then a few years ago they started charging different prices for different regions and using 1$=1euro conversion for most games. So pretty much noone in Europe buys games from steam(unless there is a steam sale or it is some indie game), since you can buy games far cheaper at retail shops.

&gt;This is one of my favorite things about PC gaming, but it's also the biggest hidden cost. I spend way more money on PC gaming than I intend to.

The war with Egypt lasted a few days. Gaddafi would be an idiot to attack Egypt. Libya has less than 10% of the people that Egypt does.

The war with Chad was because of claims to territory occupied by Chad, which were initially recognized by Chad, but the recognition of which was later withdrawn.


&gt;He also sponsored the IRA and helped plot terrorist attacks on European soil, and orchestrated the Lockerbie Bombing

No evidence the Libyan government was involved in these attacks.

&gt;He sent Libyan troops to help preserve Idi Amin's brutal dictatorship in Uganda.

Did he know about the brutality of Amin's regime?

&gt;He actively suppressed Libyan Amazighs and encouraged anti-Amazigh racism, stripped Southern Cyrenaican Tribes of tribes of their citizenship and denied them education and healthcare

[The Southern Cyrenaican tribes (Toubou) were stripped of their citizenship because they had served as King Idris bodyguards.](http://books.google.nl/books?id=xdh6zYqoCk4C&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;dq=toubou+king+idris&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pHl7OfxDJ-&amp;sig=9boFwYFQj91bVpSdeHURbezH3X8&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=ZS5hTsrHJsWZOqKJgVI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA)

&gt;He expelled 30,000 Palestinian refugees from Libya just because they held talks with Israel.

Or was there more to it?

&gt;Gadhafi earlier had ordered hundreds of Palestinians, Egyptians and Sudanese out of Libya as a result of disturbances in the city of Benghazi in June. Reports from Libya at the time said those deported were Muslim fundamentalists. 

&gt;In 1994, he introduced cruel ""purification laws"" which punished theft with the amputation of limbs, and adultery with flogging.

How many times have these laws been used?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Libya

&gt;In practise, secular policies overrode religion as a source of law.[14] Thus, by 1990, Ann Elizabeth Mayer of the University of Pennsylvania described Gaddafi's actual progress towards the Islamisation of Libyan law as ""very modest"", and largely aimed not at reviving specific sharia rules, but enforcing public morality consistent with Libyan values.[11]

&gt;One area in particular in which Libyan laws are inconsistent with sharia is in the penal law, where the punishments are lighter than those mandated by traditional hudud, especially in the case of needy offenders. Mayer analyses this as leniency inspired by the Libyan government's socialist principles.

&gt;He forged alliances with some of the most bloody, and most brutal Arab dictators, and was one of the first leaders to congratulate Syrian tyrant Hafidh al-Assad on his 1970 coup, which plunged the country in misery for years to come.

The first years of Assad's rule showed no significant human rights violations.


&gt;He pleged to kill Libyan dissidents in exile and sponsored the Red Army Faction's terror campaign in Germany, and turned Libya into a major sponsor of terrorism

&gt;But on 24 February 2004, the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 reported that the new Libyan prime minister, Shukri Ghanem, had claimed his country was not responsible for Fletcher's murder (nor for the Lockerbie bombing). Ghanem said that Libya had made the admission and paid compensation in order to bring ""peace"" and an end to international sanctions.[14] Gaddafi was said to have later retracted Ghanem's claims.

2) Yes and no. People get irony but I think you have to put in time with people before you use it successfuly. They need to get to understand your baseline before they can catch your irony. I've wondered if this has anything to do with the fact that there are many different regional tones to conversation in the U.S.


3) Economic disparities that resulted from the majority of the African-Americans being brought to this country as slaves. Statistically African-Americans are poorer and the poor are more likely to commit street crime. Street crime is more likely to result in being caught and imprisoned. Rich people commit crime too, but it's more likely to be of the Bernie Madoff variety... and he was actually never caught. Turned himself in. Also depending on where you are there could be a racist bias in the courts.


4) Seriously? Many different groups will talk among themselves one way and will then be irritated when non-members try to participate. You can see this all the time with racial minorities who have ""reclaimed"" a slur to use for themselves and get upset when an outsider uses it. Also it is really 'effing annoying when people who have never lived in our country or even set foot in it think they know all about it through secondhand hearsay. It is exactly the ignorant elitism Americans get accused of all the time. Finally, when a person feels they are being singled out and attacked they tend to defend themselves even if they might agree with part of what the attacker believes.


5) There are qualms. Many people have them. However, the nature of extreme viewpoints like ""America is #1!!!!!"" is that they will be much more obvious to outsiders compared to those of moderates who say ""America... we're a partner in a global community."" Across the world the loudest people are heard the easiest.

I would argue that if you examine the people who truly live this philosophy out, they are generally isolated, miserable social pariahs or simply surrounded by fake people trying to exploit them. 

No one likes people that have that ""better than you"" attitude. 

While a lot of men pursue fake benefits of high ladder ranking, for women in this system there is no absolutely incentive to be ""highly ranked"". In fact beating a man at his own game may in fact be detrimental to her social standing. 

Unfortunately the perception of gaming communities at large is still that of alpha male centric competition (rather than passionate pursuit of self improvement or pure joy in the game). 

I could elaborate on the personalities involved here but I think I will cut it short and to the point: 

I think the true heart of the community is dedicating yourself to something you are passionate about and surrounding yourself with others who do the same. 

Women who follow their passions and pursue what they enjoy doing are hot in my opinion and worthy of admiration. I think there is something in the spirit of competition that draws that out regardless of gender.

This is because the US has to pay for the cost of developing these medications. For instance, in Europe, countries won't let Pharmaceutical companies charge more than a certain amount for medicine. In order to make enough money to fund development with capital, the US medicine prices are bloated. This happens to us because we leave ourselves open to it but it is part of an over all philosophy that has proven powerful throughout our history. Also, we can afford to take the burden on. But it's expensive here because it's cheap in other places. 

&gt; Yes, the US does do some good in the world. I'm not denying that. However, they do a lot more bad than good.

This statement is too vague to debate. 

&gt; Doctors are paid fairly well in other countries that don't adopt the for-profit model the US seems to cling to when it comes to health care. Take the NHS in England as an example. If you go talk to some of those doctors, they live fairly well without having to exist in a system that exploits the people who have no choice but to be in it.

""Fairly Well"". Let me ask you a question: How much money would you want in exchange for your entire twenties and early thirties? Keep in mind that once you do get even a slight bit of control over your life, you are on call 24/7 a day and must constantly continue learning, learning, learning to keep up with advancements in the field. A doctor is a doctor and only a doctor. If we don't start paying them accordingly, only a very select few will keep wanting to be doctors. Plenty of brilliant people are invested in the career because it was a meaningful life that could still net them a huge cash reward...without that, they'd have to be totally willing to sacrifice their whole lives to the cause. There are very few real human beings who would make that choice. 

&gt;There are so many countries in the world that are worse off than the ones the US has invaded. There are places in this world where genocide is taking place that you rarely ever hear of. Yet, the US doesn't seem interested in those countries. On the other hand, they seem very interested in fighting in countries that have something the US wants.
The motives of the US government in foreign relations are rarely if ever altruistic. From what we've seen, they're almost always motivated by material greed.

Actually, I'm referring to within the US. We fight for free speech here where many other countries are folding up and allowing all sorts of terrifying--to me--laws to be passed about who can say what, when, where, and how. We are invested in our constitution and though plenty of bastards try to route around it for their advantage, the population as a whole has a pretty good grasp its value and defends it. 

I disagree with tons of American foreign policy, and agree with tons of it. It's a whole other debate in and of itself.

That said I can understand your questions from both points of view - the Euro one as well as the American one - I'm American with more friends overseas than many you'd casually encounter.**

&gt;Question 1. I was talking to a Canadian guy last night who studied in California. He said it wasn't uncommon for a perfectly normal, healthy, well-educated American to not own a passport. When I thought about it I realised that I've travelled to many countries all over the world and met under 5 Americans. Question: Why don't you guys travel?

One answer some may not have touched on regarding lack of travel outside the US might be because Americans are afraid of culture shock. My mother lived/worked/traveled around Europe extensively before I entered HS. I obtained my 1st passport in 1990 to travel with my whole family to France. My mother raised us in a more European fashion so being served wine at meals was no shock, being left to explore Paris at 15 with a 13 year old sister was a known safe experience, my mother spoke some French [fluent in Spanish] and knew how get us over there. We may have had earlier passports, I can't recall, because we traveled to Jamaica/Mexico/other islands before we hit HS too but I'm uncertain what documents were needed for children. [ie: might've only had birth certs and my mom had a full passport - hers had pages stapled to it because she was so well traveled!] I got my 2nd passport in 2001 in order to travel to Japan alone. I am an exception though I do know many poor punk rock kids who have gone to Europe many times over due to band tours. In fact, most of my friends have active passports and take off on summer tours through Europe. Many Americans are not this fortunate, though. I think Americans see world travel as an excess of the very wealthy and limit their travel to the same 1,2,3 US spots for holiday. Americans are not a culturally diverse or exploitative people as a whole. Also many Americans are AFRAID to leave the USA. When I was planning to go to Japan following 9/11 my sister was like ""WHAT IF A TERRORIST ATTACKS YOU?"" I was like, ""in Japan?"" Really. I have a friend in Israel now and she was there during the Palestine / Israel suicide bombings. No American [99% of them] would never have gone to Israel as she did but her boyfriend, culture and religion are in Israel. So she went.

Also, we have student loan debt, uni debt, rising costs of healthcare, worthless money [exchange rates suck for us, rule for you!], people who pop out babies at 22, untreated mentally ill people who are depressed, corporations who don't allow holiday time and on and on.

&gt;Question 2. I've heard that Americans take themselves very seriously. Even heard the US referred to as an 'irony-free zone'. Is this true? If not, why do people say this?

I don't know however I think this can be said about a lot of other cultures. Maybe even worse if you're a Brit. or an Asian [Japanese] though I feel like a lot of cities in the US are different. I think urban areas are probably more youth centric v. smaller towns where young people are pushed to grow up/marry/get serious at a young age.

&gt;Question 4. You readily admit your country's short-comings among one another but when a foreigner says anything against the USA, Americans tend to turn ultra-patriotic and abrasive. Why?

I don't think this is different elsewhere. I've made light of the money in Canada and NOT been well received. Canadians have no sense of humor about their fucking loonies and toonies, dude. I'm pretty sure I'd be beat with a bat if I poked holes in their government system or their economic issues! I tried that a while ago and was told to fuck off.

&gt;Question 5. Why is is that 'elitism' is frowned upon, but there are no qualms about claiming that the USA is the best country in the world?

I think it's irony for some people. I think for others they've never left the US and believe what they see/hear/read. Many Americans don't go past US Newsbroadcasts for their news. That said, our collapse is effecting other nations in Europe. We are a lynch pin in world affairs but being such a large, diverse and rather young nation we move forward at a snail's pace compared to European nations that have established their shit [shit we used to establish ourselves even] long ahead of us. Basically we're like infants and very ME centered as a country. I think Europe and other developing nations are like the Moms, Dads and other extended family. We all gotta hang together but sometimes we act like total brats and shit our pants in public a lot :(

&gt;Question 6. Does the 'American Dream' still exist?

Yes but it's way less accessible than it was 200, 100 or even 50 years ago. I feel like one of the last bastions for it was the birth of the internet and HS drop outs making bank as IT professionals. In this modern world there aren't too many places a HS Freshman drop out can make enough to have a ballin' DC apartment and a brand new BMW than the early dot-com era of the 90s.",1,True,1314993637,,1,,False,[deleted],0,,1427551559,t1_c2h2tif,0,t3_k2ch2,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,False

You are begging the question. Libertarianism is better. Statism makes things worse. That's just asserting the same thing.

I don't know what to defend. China is doing fantastic. China is quite controlling. The US has the lead economy in the world and that position was build during the latter half of the 20th century when we were both highly regulated and heavily taxed. Germany is doing great. Not so free speech in Germany and 40% taxes as a percentage of GDP. (The US was in a great position after WWII, so the example of the US is not as compelling as others IMO.) 

Your Chile example is interesting. Compared with the US, Chile has comparatively low taxes compared with GDP, which agrees with your point. However, they also have a government ""Council on Innovation and Competition"" which is not so libertarian. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Chile#Economic_policies)

But if one measures government involvement by tax rate as a percentage of GDP, there are a lot of countries lower than Chile and, starting from the bottom, the lower numbered countries in this list tend to all be horrible.

t3_k2ch2,0,c2h2ygq,"1) Well, I sort of know what you mean, even as an American. It took me forever to learn how to drive (I just never had the desire), but I did travel out of the country when I was 16. So, ever since then whenever I've had to use some form of picture I.D., I use my passport. I've had a range of reactions to it. Most people are utterly confused. They think I'm scamming them. Some people will become very interested and comment that they've never seen a passport before. Often, I'll have to show the person where to look for my birth date. Of course, I do live in a midwestern state. Maybe my issues are regional. I don't remember it coming up at all when I was in NY or Chicago. 

As for why many Americans don't travel abroad much, people do go to Mexico and Canada fairly frequently. It's just not as convenient or economical to travel to other countries as it is in Europe. I've often writhed with jealousy at the idea of my European friends being able to hop a train to a new foreign local with relative ease. 


2) I've never heard the ""America is an irony free zone"" thing before. I don't really know whether or not that is true. I haven't run across it much. One thing I'll say is that people often do seem to get the definition of ""irony"" wrong. People often look to coincidence and call it ""irony."" I don't know that this is purely American though. 

3) I'm hesitant to answer this question without being armed with the facts. However, I will venture to give my opinion. You're right. Many African Americans are in prison. In 1999, the number of African Americans in prison neared the 1 mil mark. The factors at play are as complicated and, in some ways, as sinister as you would expect. First of all, America accounts for around 5% of the world population, yet we also account for around 25% of the world's incarcerated. African Americans make up around 13% of the American population. In 2006 the number of Americans living in poverty was around 36 mil, with African Americans making up almost 25%. There are several factors to this. To make it sound almost insultingly simple (sorry!), I would say that poverty begets poverty. You have less access to proper healthcare, decent education, work, and less opportunity. So, you have a culture of people who enter a vicious cycle of poverty. This is not a phenomenon that only effects African Americans, but it does effect a large number of them. Another more unsavory reason is that, in America, our laws are undeniably racist. The war on drugs has caused a discrepancy in how we prosecute crime. In my opinion. A person will get locked up in prison for drug possession, and the sentences are more likely to be much harsher to ethnic minorities. Meanwhile, drunk driving (I believe is just as dangerous) is often given a community sentence rather than time in prison. Add all of that to the fact that drugs and drug culture are more readily available in low income areas, and you've got a nice social Molotov cocktail that scorches poor ethnic minorities. All that being said, oddly, white women are way more likely to be incarcerated than any other female ethnicities. I don't know if any of that answered your question. By the way, America isn't the only place that punishes African Americans more harshly than Caucasians. England recently published a study identifying a discrepancy in how they prosecuted white sex crimes as opposed to black sex crimes. White criminals were often given community sentences, while black offenders were incarcerated.

4) I think everyone is defensive. I might complain about my sister (never really), but if you do I may just kick you in the shin. That being said, there are a lot of great things about America. There are just so many disappointing and frustrating things as well. 

5) Most countries tend to be egocentric. We have done some great things as a nation, but those days do seem to be behind us for the most part.

6) Everyone still thinks it does. I'm not so sure whether it does or whether it is an illusion keeping people from supporting each other.

Well, I didn't mean to say that.  I think that miracles (proper) aren't particularly common.  I would posit that most of those ""miracles"" we see coming out of the Fundies are based on coincidence (usually regarding money) or placebo (usually regarding general aches and pains).

I should point out that coincidence and placebo can still be the work of God, but they aren't miracles (that to which only a supernatural cause can be applied).

In order to do this thought experiment, we have to distinguish a few things.  If religion, specifically Catholicism, never existed in the West then things would be drastically different.  There would have been no one to fill the power void caused by the fall of the Roman Empire.  I posit that the early middle ages would have lasted a lot longer and been filled with much more brutal warfare (the Franks were able to gain control of a large chunk of Europe in no small thanks to the Church who gave them their initial authority.  Without this the Franks may have been fractured themselves or whatnot).  This one thing alone would drastically change the face of the Western World.

So if God did not exist (which is to say that religion was not discovered), I think we could say that things would be a lot different.

If religion still existed it might or might not be different.  For example, if God exists and there is one ""right"" religion, it is plausible to say that God acts to ""help"" that religion.  As such, were God to not exist, that one religion would have less influence (perhaps).  I say that that religion is Catholicism (and Judaism before it) and so the situation I presented earlier stands (inasmuch as thought experiments work).

This experiment really depends on how we establish the rules of it.  Does the religion which is true remain?  Is history the exact same as it was, just minus God?

I don't know if it really works, to be honest.",1,True,1314996282,,1,,False,dasbush,0,,1427551720,t1_c2h367d,0,t3_k249h,DebateAChristian,t5_2ryd5,False

t3_k2ch2,0,c2h36pl,"1) It is true that proportionately much more europeans hold passports than Americans. Americans do enjoy to travel but many (in my experience) like consistency in travel. Some people (especially where I'm from in West Virginia) will go to Myrtle Beach and only Myrtle Beach every year (maybe an occasional voyage to Disney World). But there are others, although we are the minority, who enjoy international travel, and have enough time off and money to afford such vacations. Now, there is a small minority of narrow minded conservatives who do not approve of the idea of international travel, especially in areas near where I live now in rural Kentucky, many of whom were almost offended in the fact that my wife and I chose Vietnam for our honeymoon instead of Gatlinburg. (for you Europeans Gatlinburg is Like DisneyWorld+Country Music and home to the famous Dollywood) But then again, this is a very small minority and does not reflect a total US view on international travel.   

2) I guess to understand irony you need some wit and/or intelligence and not everybody's got it. 

3)Poverty, Racism, Drug Trade, Socioeconomic Status, etc. 

4+5)Its a generalization about the US and I will retort with generalization. Europeans tend to be a bit more openly critical of the US than any other country. And there is a noticeable disdain towards Americans from some Europeans. Views from Europeans tend to be that we are ignorant, uncultured, and ethnocentric. These views are not all completely untrue but I would say that they are false for the majority (and I grew up in the middle of fucking nowhere west virginia). We do have culture in the US its just a very odd culture; Above ground pools, plastic lawn decor, American flags on everything, and thats just rural US. In regards to Americans saying ""US is the best country,"" it is simply our form of nationalism. I'm sure if you asked a Brit what is the best country on earth, he would probably not say Belgium, but would choose the UK. Americans, for all our faults, are patriotic and for the most part, love our country very much. Also, the US has been the most dominant economy in the world since 1945, after almost all competing countries' economies were destroyed by the war. We have also had the most dominant military in the world since the 40's as well. Both could contribute to the views of American exceptionalism.

When I say it sounds like pitch gibberish, I mean it. I have perfect pitch. In my experience, working with the composers, they had no knowledge of music theory or pitch relations or timbre or rhythm. They started at square one with synth, and started putting stuff together. They couldn't read sheet music. Again, this was just my experience.

Improvisation and experimentation has been much different in the past century than it was in the middle ages up to the 1900s. A violinist (say, in Mozart's time or Beethoven's or even Dvorak's) who was improvising had to stay within a set of rules, within a set of keys, and play in the time signature but with rubato. It was a soloists chance to show off how well they knew the rules, and how they could play within them.
