1) The article posted by abuali7866 completely ignores the fundamental ties between antisemitism and anti-Israelism and the reality that many veil their antisemitism by criticizing ""Israelis"" or ""Zionists"". This is a common thing for bigots to do lately - use carefully selective language to deflect such accusations. This does not mean that there is not legitimate criticism of Israel, but a lot of it - especially on the internet, where people don't have to publicly out themselves as bigots - is antisemitic, and places an unfair double standard on Israel, while ignoring far greater civil rights offenders around the world. This criticism also usually ignores the civil rights advantages that Israel has over every other nation in the middle east.

2) Sailer says ""I would take exception to one thing the author claimed, i.e., the ""near annihilation"" of European Jewry."" He also says ""At any rate, this is not near annihilation, and how the Germans rounded up and took fifteen million Jews prisoner and put them into camps which either killed them or entitled them to BEG compensation while they were also fighting Russia, France, Britain and the USA is quite a story.""

Being the highly destabilizing force they are, they either carve out an empire themselves--which is doomed due to resupply issues, or wage a shock-and-awe campaign designed to produce political capitulation and accommodation.  This is similar to what europeans did in central america with limited resupply capabilities.  I don't think there's any reason to believe a short campaign on Rome wouldn't be capable of doing this.  The Romans elite were highly politically sophisticated, and I doubt that they'd see a war of attrition as politically reasonable.  

The shock and awe is just qualitatively different than Hannibal's invasion.  That was dealing with a conventionally superior military force.  You can say all you want about the Romans being tactically intelligent--most of that tactical intelligence was concentrated at the top.

Are they really able to ship products to their third party distributors in Europe without incurring higher costs? This all could be caused by supply chain issues.

I don't own one of these, so I am not sure, but it could be possible that the product is made in one of their North American plants, which would easily show why the price varies so much.

The real deal is not that Americans can't afford college education, it's that our culture and society is much more diverse and distributed than most of Europe and/or Australia.

High school is easy here, and if you are low income and a minority getting your college paid for entirely is certainly not an unachievable feat if you are even slightly ambitious. The big thing is, a lot of people in American don't *want* to go to college and that's perfectly fine. Some people are just raised wrong or have cultural issues that tell them the best way to get rich and have a successful life is to thug out and start rapping or get drunk and redneck the hell out of yourself and garbage like that. I know tradesman such as machinists and electricians who make 60k a year and they aren't even 30, and they are some of the happiest people I know.  The fact of the matter is we are running out of tradesman and skilled laborers, so pay is going up dramatically every year for those types of jobs, and for some people who didn't care as much about high school as they should have paying for college with loans may not even be worth it if they can just enter a trade doing something they love.

I had just graduated college and thought this is the perfect time to do this, and I regretted never studying abroad.  I knew I was only going to go for 6 months, but I just packed up and left.  Australia is probably the easiest country for Americans to get work visas.  I applied online, it cost about $250, and had my visa in about 10 hours.  I would suggest you go to Melbourne first, it is the easiest city to find work in.  I moved into a hostel called ""Home Travellers"" in St.Kilda (a sort of suburb of Melbourne) and it was basically full of other backpackers working or trying to find work so they could just live in Melbourne.  You'll be amazed at how many people you meet who are trying to do the exact same thing you are.

I tried to find a job before I left, but that is pretty much impossible.  I would say that if you want a job, you'll find one.  you might not find a great one at first, but you just take what you can get and then keep looking.  I've played golf my entire life so I figured it would be pretty cool to work on a course there.  After being in Australia for a week, sending my CV to every course in the area, I had two job offers.  A week later I started working at Albert Park Golf Course.  I made $21/hour, no real responsibilities, and I got to work outside all day.

So I lived in this hostel for about four months, just working and trying to experience as much as I could.  I made so many friends from all over the world (I am planning a 6 month trip through Aisa and Europe to visit a lot of those friends now).  I saved up some money and then spent one month traveling around Australia, and one month traveling all over New Zealand.  The trip was amazing, and I just can't believe how we Americans miss out on this sort of traveling.  Backpacking to us is a month in Europe, when to the rest of the world it is probably a minimum of 6 months away.  

I was definitely scared to go by myself, but it turned out to be the best thing.  It forces you to initiate conversations, and I am now much more outgoing, confident person.  Pretty much every one of my friends is jealous of my trip.

Well, I would say definitely just do this.  Get your work visa, buy your plane ticket and just go.  You'll be nervous, and second guess yourself until you have a job, but just keep reminding yourself that so many other people do this exact thing (but Americans just don't hear about it).

The problem is, he (and his throngs of ass-kissing fans) think he has a universalized aesthetic eye and appreciation...but his vision is only realized in European fashion events, old/rich/usually white individuals, and places like New York, Milan, and Paris. Although he used to be a street photographer, his blog actually reveals a very very specific taste for old, preppy European men and/or ""acceptably white"" (ie Italian) models.  Occasionally he still posts ""quirky"" street fashions but since his site took off a few years ago, he mostly covers the typical high fashion events.

Among the ""quirky"" photos, he's included a photo of a homeless African American man that he praised for some bullshit color play of the man's denim jeans and his bag.  He has no comment on when white people appropriate ""ethnic"" wear (ie hipsters in LA with henna) but almost always focuses on the ""ethnic"" when witnessed on a person of said descent.

&gt;Are we talking about Common Law marriage, are we talking about Coverture? Are we talking about the Renaissance? Are we talking about Victorian England? The High middle ages? What?

Of course, you would be confused by the progress of human and individual rights over the course of two thousand years of human interaction in the West.  

&gt; I'll address one massive factual error. Women were never property. At worst they were wards like children are today.

The general tendency of human rights since the fall of the Roman Empire has been (with a few exceptions) towards more individual and human rights as time progressed.  If you look back to marriage and family law of ancient Rome, a wife certainly *was* property, along with her children, to the extent that a husband could in certain instances be judge, jury, and *executioner* to his entire family.  Did that statute remain static for 2000 years afterwards?  OF COURSE NOT.  But the foundational precepts of Roman law have remained a cornerstone of western marriage tradition.

&gt; I want you to attempt to prove your assertion that women were property with first order sources.

What??  Are you high?  I think you mean *secondary* sources here...

&gt; For example, you could attempt to find bills of sale from 'white female slave markets' in Europe

Oh.  No--you were trying to be serious.  Well, let me just hop on a plane to Avignon, take a few high quality pictures of some incredibly rare medieval French manuscripts about *femme sole* vs. *femme covert,* write a scholarly article about it, get it published, and then shove my personal copy of that article up your ass and light it on fire.  I'm not here to do your work for you.

Frankly, I'm boggled by the fact that you actually dispute the concept that women were property in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, when practically *everybody* except the pope was somebody's property.  It's so obscenely widely held that vassalage and peerage, apprenticeship, the Church, political leaders, the slave trade, witch-hunting manuals like the *Malleus Malificarum*, and other institutions had vastly restricted human rights for women, even below that of men, that you trying to deny it is an exceedingly extraordinary claim.  Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, so the onus is quite clearly on *you* to prove that women *weren't* property to be used at the behest of men, in the same way that men were property to be used at the behest of their noble lord, and later their state.

Please, tell me that [Lady Radegund](http://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/about-jesus-college/history/pen-portraits/st-radegund/) *wasn't* taken as a legal hostage and duly married in accordance with the Catholic Church in order to substantiate Frankish Catholicism in Thuringia in the 500's.  Please, inform me why the ancient tradition of [Turkish enslavement of Eastern European women](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_(Ottoman_Empire) ) (hey--they were white, too!) lasted until the 19th century, when those women obviously weren't being treated as property for the 2000 years prior.  I mean, it's not like we even get our term ""slave"" from [Slav](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery#Etymology), the group of haggard Eastern European tribes that were routinely pillaged for slaves, both male and female, during the Roman Empire and later Medieval courts.  

And please, provide me with some rationale for explaining why medieval marriage laws, vassalage, and peerage somehow did not apply to women, seeing as they were both bound by law courts, required to serve at the behest of their lords and ladies, and beholden to their guilds and nunneries.  I'm not saying that men didn't *also* have these same restrictions--they did.  But you're *insane* to think that the extreme dearth of individual freedom and self-determination that marks the slow crawl of western society out of the Dark Ages somehow managed to completely miss women, all the evidence to the contrary that has been piled up over decades of primary and secondary research.

Although they have apparently said that they won't do WW2 because it's overdone or whatever, if the AC series is going to eventually end up in the modern age, how can you avoid WW2 in the AC canon?

Plus, what do they expect to do when the inevitable modern-day AC comes around?

Either way, I hope they take their sweet ass time fleshing this series out. There should be absolutely no rush to get to the modern-day AC title.

For example, on the Austrian side of things, I hear a lot of hard money advocacy and the advocacy of a gold standard. I'm long silver myself, it's my only investment (Because I know gold and silver are in it's cycle and fiat currencies are having a crisis of confidence right now) But forcing hard money has been a bane in many an occasion. The destruction of colonial scrip, and the crime of 1873 are examples of this. Also, I've deduced that gold standards suck for the common man. Not only because of those aforementioned scenarios, but when used to represent gold and silver itself, governments will cheat gold, trying to issue more claim checks to gold (dollar bills) than there is actual gold in the vaults. They did it during the Bretton Woods system, they did it all over Europe during the world wars. It's why we're on a fiat standard now; Nixon de facto defaulted because of how the government kept cheating gold.

On the other hand, Keynesians have left me disappointed as well. I never understood the logic of throwing money at a failing system that, when even when you throw everything but the golden bars at the collapsing system, it still caves in on you. It's insanity in my eyes. The poster boy to him is of course, Paul Krugman, while wishing no disrespect to the man, his track record makes me seriously question his credibility as an expert and question whether he's a proxy of malicious system of propaganda. I admire his dedication at least, despite his mistakes, but he's the reason why I listen to investors and not to economists. Investors put their money where their mouth is, and have a stake on being right and competent at the shots they call.

This post is probably gonna warrant a downvoting from both school fans, given how rabid they both are. I guess my bottom line is that I don't trust either school of thought. I do seem to gravitate more towards Austrian, but this is subverted because of it's over emphasis on hard money with no exceptions. Both schools are far too dogmatic, and you can't be too dogmatic during a time of financial bust.

Suarez can play behind the striker, but I find him better as the out-and-out striker. In any case, he will be asked to do both, and that will take a toll on him physically, especially when you consider the fact that he has not had much rest over the summer. 

Downing too can play behind the striker, but that leaves our left wing empty. 

That leaves Henderson and Jonjo. Henderson has been played on the right so far, and has yet to get a chance to impress in a more central position for Liverpool.

This includes what many other countries report as stillbirths. In Austria and Germany, fetal weight must be at least 500 grams (1 pound) to count as a live birth; in other parts of Europe, such as Switzerland, the fetus must be at least 30 centimeters (12 inches) long. In Belgium and France, births at less than 26 weeks of pregnancy are registered as lifeless. And some countries don't reliably register babies who die within the first 24 hours of birth. Thus, the United States is sure to report higher infant mortality rates. For this very reason, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which collects the European numbers, warns of head-to-head comparisons by country. 

Having said that in other stats, Cancer, for example the Europeans do not record a patient as a cancer sufferer until the have a full blown neo-plasm. The US record potential cancers as cancer. particularly prostate. thus the US has a much better cancer record than Europe. however, if you record the mortality rate deads per capita. the USA is slightly worse.  

Its a dark world health stats.  Overall, the US is as good as any European country, theres not much in it, the astonishing thing is the cost per capita. Its well over DOUBLE the European average. USA is paying for a Rolls Royce and getting a standard town car. Europeans are paying for a standard town car and getting a standard town car.        
      
I might as well add that health care being ""free at the point of delivery"" is a great idea.  It really must take a lot of stress away.

Edit: Cancer citations and whatnot.

A quick look at the cancer figures show the 52% of female UK patients and 44% of males survive (2003 figs) survive 5 years compared to 62/66 for the USA. 
All well and good but the diagnosis rates of cancer are far higher in the USA, 470 per 100K V 370 per 100K in the UK.  **27% higher**.
Thats odd. 
The reason is Europeans do not diagnose cancer as being cancer until it is a full blown neo-plasm.

The mortality rate, the numbers who die of cancer per year tell a different story. 190 per 1000 die of cancer per year in the USA and 180 per year in the UK.  Statistically insignificant.  ( I've shown the UK and USA here as we can read English, France does better )

Christians had the complete run of Europe in parallel to the Arabs Caliphate during the dark ages.  It would be impossible to ""view the pursuit of scientific knowledge as an important"" and to have come up with absolutely **NOTHING** in terms of science for nearly a thousand years.  Christian Europe of the year 500 knew exactly the same thing as Christian Europe of the year 1200.  Not one single equation or principle of physics, science, medicine, biology, mathematics, astronomy came out of Europe during this time.  While at the same time, nearly every Greek text was being rewritten with new discoveries and analysis over in the Arabic empire (including the scientific method, algebra, the start of chemistry, the first theory of optics, a mapping of the human circulatory system, a complete revision of the Ptolemaic planetary system, a position-based number system, etc).

Even having established Universities as a system of learning the Europeans could not actually make any progress.  Why is that?  You just have to look at the actual curriculum of those Universities.  It was &gt; 50% religion.  And the rest was *pre*-Greek garbage.

When they recovered Aristotle, they invented ""Scholasticism"" (which today is just called ""Apologetics"") from which they made the oh so useful contribution to society called ""Ontological arguments"".  If they had really embraced logic for what it was, then why didn't they invent boolean logic (a very obvious next step) or algorithms?

They also bought into Aristotle's cosmology which supported a geocentric model of the universe, without any analysis whatsoever.  On this flimsy authority by association reasoning (and oh what an impressive demonstration of their understanding of his logic) they tried Galileo for supporting the Copernican/Aristarchus heliocentrism.  You don't find similar persecutions of science in other religions.

The Christians lost the knowledge of how to build aqueducts -- an important city design technology.  And in 700 years since the fall of the Roman Empire they were unable to recover or rediscover this fundamental idea.

These were the most backward people in the world.  And they *STILL ARE*.  They has centuries to try to improve their lot and they could do nothing without stealing knowledge from the outside.  The only thing that turned Europe around was a few curious kings basically *extracting* the knowledge of science from the Arabs, followed by the rise of humanism, empiricism and the corresponding rise of secularism.  They only started making their *own* discoveries in the 1500s.

Why was Peter Abelard persecuted by the church authority of the dark ages, when Thomas Hobbes was only censored?  By the time of Hobbes, the church's grip had loosened, as secularism was on the rise.  You were allowed to think, and respond to internal desires to satisfy one's curiosity, because the culture allowed for it, over the continuous objections of the fading church.

There's case after case of this.

The foundations of optics, mathematics, chemistry and history all come from the Arabs, the Greeks and the Hindus.  And yes, sometimes they were very religious.  But not Christian.  At least not until they could inherit a science that had already embraced empiricism (and therefore secularism) when their thinking could be mechanically removed from their religion.

This lead to the concept of ""compartmentalization"" as a way for the religious to participate in science.  I.e., acting as secularists when science was involved, since the content of Christianity is completely incompatible with science.

And this democracy failed many times. In the 18th century, it led to anarchy and rebellions, and later to the partitions of Poland and disappearance of the whole country, which was captured by the less democratic countries for sure. After it was rebuild in the interwar period, Piłsudski, our national hero who had a strong involvement in gaining indepencence and estabilishment of a republic in 1918, overthrew the government by force in 1926, which made Poland essentially a dictatorship, because of the fact that the democracy worked badly. Nowadays, it also works badly and most of the people realize that, but despite this fact the current estabilishment gets nearly all of the votes, because ""the other parties have no chance of getting into parliament"". And I think we will have another dictator some day.

This is how your policies work back in the real world:

anti-racist is a code word for anti-White.

Later at the Hotel, The younger and stronger members of our group were helping out by moving all the luggage from the bus to the hotel as quickly as possible, since the bus could be parked out front only for a very short time.

The sidewalk was insanely crowded so while carrying the heavy luggage, I began to loudly say 'Poisson! Poisson!' to the crowds in order to get through.

I don't understand how some are ready to deny the basics of the economy only to push their Big Govt/leftist agenda. Every single country who has cut the taxes experienced an economic growth in normal times and a smaller recession in times of crisis. 

Ever heard of China's ""Free economic zones"" established by Deng Xiaoping back when China was dirt poor? Countries like Japan or Switzerland have low taxes some countries in the EU have a flat tax. 


Here's a list of studies:


&gt;These findings imply that in our contemporary era of large government, high taxes lead to lower economic growth. When taxes go up, the growth in the income of taxpayers should decline. 

..........

&gt;Cashin (1995) found that each one percent increase in taxes as a percent of total output lowers output per worker by about two percent. To be sure, he observes positive effects of spending from taxes, but typically the positive spending effects are only about onehalf as large as the negative tax effect, which is about the same thing as saying that private sector spending is twice as productive as public sector outlays. A new study by Holcombe and Lacombe (2001) compares counties on both sides of state borders - and observes that high taxes impede growth.

..........

&gt;Using a complex general equilibrium model, German economist Bernhard
Heitger (1993) concluded that for “the most important OECD countries, taxation turns out to be growth-retarding. “ Roubini, Milesi and Gian (1998) concluded that “In general, the taxation of factor incomes...is growth-reducing.”

.........

&gt;[For the USA] The results ( Figure 3) show that the low tax states outperformed the high tax states by either measure. Income per person rose by 135 percent from 1957 to 1997 in the low tax states, compared with 120 percent in the high tax ones. Using the broader measure of growth, real personal income rose dramatically more in the low tax states, going up by an average of 315 percent, compared with 268 percent in the high tax jurisdictions. This implies that not only were individuals benefitting from faster income growth in the low tax states, but also that population growth was larger in the jurisdictions with lower tax burdens. In general, the lower the tax burden, the higher the rate of economic growth.

............


&gt;Looking first (figure 4) at the entire period 1957 to 1997, per capita real income growth was substantially higher (138 vs. 115 percent) in the 10 states with the lowest increases in tax burden compared with the 10 states with the greatest increase.

...........


&gt;While Sweden (and indeed virtually all continental Western European countries) were increasing their welfare states massively and increasing taxes from an already high 40.7 percent of total output in 1970 to 52.1 percent in l999, the British were revolting against the continued expansion of government, and the aggregate tax burden actually fell (modestly, to be sure) from 1970 to 1999. By the latter year, the British tax burden was 30 percent lower than that in Sweden, and about 20 percent below major European nations such as France. As a consequence, economic growth fell sharply in most Western European nations – but not in England. The fiscal revolution that began with Margaret Thatcher in 1979 was not reversed after she left office in 1990. Britain went from being the tired old lady of Europe to being an engine of growth.

Book 1: Emerson's Arithmetic

If the covers are intact and the binding is somewhat together, value would be somewhere between $20-30 USD. There's a copy of the [second series](http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=2745288478&amp;searchurl=an%3Demerson%26bi%3D0%26bx%3Doff%26ds%3D30%26recentlyadded%3Dall%26sortby%3D17%26sts%3Dt%26tn) on Abe, but it doesn't provide much information.

Book 2: Murphy's Lucian

If the cover is just a bit loose, it won't hurt the value much. If it is bound in the original publisher's cloth (usually black or grey) it will add a bit of value. I wasn't able to find a copy from that exact year, but more than likely it's the same edition as [this version](http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=1047998683&amp;searchurl=an%3Dmurphy%26bi%3D0%26bx%3Doff%26ds%3D30%26recentlyadded%3Dall%26sortby%3D1%26tn%3Dlucian%26x%3D0%26y%3D0), just a European edition. I'd actually give yours a bit more value, as it was probably printed from the original plates, and not an American copy of the plates. US reproduction plates from 1815 to about 1844 were not the best quality, and the book produced from them were often a little shabby and hard to read.

Book 3: Gradus ad Parnassum

Shame about the cover. You can get it rebound for about $150; in a fully restored state, it would be worth about $250 USD. [Here's a quick list](http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?bi=0&amp;bx=off&amp;ds=30&amp;recentlyadded=all&amp;sortby=1&amp;sts=t&amp;tn=Gradus+ad+Parnassum&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;yrh=1820&amp;yrl=1800) of similar editions.

Book 4: TACITI HISTORIARUM

I don't see a lot of antiquarian copies of this available, but a lot of reproductions. The older copies are going for $35-$65, but if I'm correct, that one doesn't have a cover, which hurts the value quite a bit. As is, $15

Book 5: Opera Interpretatione Et Notis

Looks like that copy is a little worn, but not too awful. Found a slightly earlier copy [here](http://www.abaa.org/books/251542165.html). That edition is a bit older, but more worn - split the difference and I think you have a reasonable value.

Book 6: Elements

This book is always in demand, I get collectors looking for older copies all the time. This particular edition looks like it has seen better days, and that will cut the value in half or so. The text seems to be all there, correct? That helps. The cover is pretty worn, looks like leather binding was done by an amateur, a proper rebinding wouldn't have curled and pulled away like that. Often, it was just a matter of the binder not having the proper chemicals available to him, so he had to make due with substandard materials. Anyway... [Abebooks has an earlier copy](http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=1493667761&amp;searchurl=bi%3D0%26bx%3Doff%26ds%3D30%26pn%3DWogan%26recentlyadded%3Dall%26sortby%3D17%26sts%3Dt%26tn%3Delements%26x%3D0%26y%3D0) from the same publisher for $375 - [but as you can see](http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=euclid&amp;bi=0&amp;bx=off&amp;ds=30&amp;recentlyadded=all&amp;sortby=17&amp;sts=t&amp;tn=elements&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;yrh=1815&amp;yrl=1790), any older Euclid will fetch a good price. In this condition, I'd say your copy is worth $85-$125 USD.

Plus his ego is ridiculous.  

Another thing that makes him look worse then he is, is that our coach always choose Bendtner, even when he is not fit and that have made him look worse then he is. We have other good strikers to choose from that would fit better then Bendtner against some opponents. 

On another note I think Arsenal butchered Bendtner and Arsene Wenger is playing him totally wrong. Bendtner should not be in Arsenal, but in some mid table team instead and should be played more as an Andy Carroll kind of strike, and not a Van Persie kind of striker or winger. He totally does not fit into Arsenals short passing, work the ball in to the box kind of play, he should be playing on a team that rapes the ball forward with a lot of crossing and long passes into the box ala Stoke.

This is patently ridiculous.  The black African cultures have been backward and degenerate since the beginning of time.

I don't know if you have somewhere to stay or if you will be at a hostel but I can say that 50 dollars a day will be a damn-near impossibility if you have to pay for lodging. Hostels will run you 20-30 at the minimum! Then you have to account for transportation, unless you walk of course. Food can be cheap but you will probably want to eat out and experience the culture a bit more. Additionally, you will be in a foreign country and are probably going to want to check out cool museums - that will cost you too. However I didn't go to Eastern Europe so I can't exactly say the pricing. Go to Berlin, seriously Berlin is dirt cheap and was my favorite city out of over 15. It was magical! The beer was fantastic and the food delicious.

My most memorable experience was being in Greece during the austerity measures and witnessing the riots. I also enjoyed the MASSIVE music festival called distortion in Copenhagen. The couchsurfing in Berlin was awesome - I stayed with the two coolest girls who showed me many interesting sites. Honestly - everywhere was so much fun.

This would drive down business waste.

&gt; Renegotiations would hurt the businesses in question and their providers. Almost doubling the minimum wage would probably force many to go under entirely.

Again, the statistics haven't born that out.  We did not see waves of businesses failing in the wake of previous minimum wage increases.  Probably maybe speculative statements notwithstanding.

What's more, there's nothing looking those admin/sales prices in stone.  Walmart, for instance, regularly makes use of its bulk purchasing power to get better rates.  They negotiate better real estate deals.  And they've been far more competitive than their rivals at Sears.

Meanwhile, Starbucks is known to pay its own baristas upwards of $13 / hr in some states.

http://www.glassdoor.com/Hourly-Pay/Starbucks-Barista-Hourly-Pay-E2202_D_KO10,17.htm

The notion that the business would collapse under the weight of salaries multiple locations *already* pay seems absurd.  We're not going very far outside acceptable range.

&gt; Furthermore, who is to decide that other expenses are ""business waste"" rather than just operational requirements?

I think that job goes to the businesses.

&gt;&gt; On the flip side, newly enriched employees

&gt; if they existed

Again, I'm baffled by the persistent belief that raising the minimum wage will not raise the wages of the people receiving minimum wage.  This dogged insistence that paying someone $15 / hr rather than $8 / hr won't have any impact on their salaries is downright bizarre.

&gt; Increased costs for businesses to pay a wage higher than what the market demands would offset any increases in income for some employees.

That makes no sense.  Assuming a business's operational budget is 30% of costs, doubling salaries should only affect 30% of the cost of the product.  Meanwhile, doubling the salary - for the employee - would result in a 100% increase in salary.  Even if employees did see their expenses rise 30% (and I'm not sure why big ticket items like rent, car payments, utilities would see a corresponding 30% rise either) they'd have 100% more money to pay it with.

&gt; It's just misdistribution of resources.

I think this is where we have a fundamental disagreement.  Paying your employees more money is not a misdirection of resources.  The national average wage is a vital foundation of a country's economic strength and flexibility.  If our citizens can't afford the products that the nation produces - if the majority of employees can't afford an Apple computer or a Ford truck or a Mr Gatti's pizza - then domestic business collapses and we become slaves of the foreign markets.

That's a bad place to be when you're watching markets like Europe (today) or Asia (in the 90s) implode.  Strong economies are ones that are internally self-sustainable.

&gt; Higher real wages are a good thing if they come from increased productivity. If they come from a price floor on labor, the higher wages just apply to fewer people anyway and are harmful to workers who get their hours cut or get fired, and to businesses which have to bear added costs.

That's the problem, though.  Productivity isn't pegged to wages in any meaningful way.  My boss can bill me at whatever he wants.  He's not obligated to tell me what that number is and he's not obligated to pay me more if my services increase business revenue.  When productivity goes up (and it's been rising steadily straight through the recession) employees don't see any commensurate wage increases.

And yet people are displaced all over the world all the time. Otherwise how do you think counties change over history? I wont get into a discussion whether Israel deliberately displaced Arabs in 48 or whether they left out of their own will as they were told by their own leaders. The truth is somewhere in the middle and there is no 100% proof either way.

If you want to treat '48 as some magical number that every one should return to, then why not go to the 1900 and the ottoman empire? Why not go to 100BCE and before Jews were kicked out?

It doesn't matter anymore what happened in '48, and should have no baring on today. Even if you say that Israel was a devil in '48 doesn't give anyone the right to throw out and displace the millions of Jews who now live in Israel and call it their home. It is no less evil (or even more so) then what you claim happened in '48.

Also how will you deal will a German that married a Pole, their kid married a someone who is half Italian half Yemenite, their child married someone who is a quarter American, a quarter Lybian, a quarter Palestinian (you know one of the Jews who were here before magic '48 came around and even before), and a quarter Russian?
This is not a theoretical question.

&gt; The question about the Zionists living in Israel: If your from Europe go to Europe, if your from Yemen, Iran, or Egypt then you must go back.

And who whill vouch for them not getting butchered?? There is a good reason that once Israel was created Jews, Bahá'í, Sudannese (sp?), Arab Gays, etc... have run to Israel so they can be treated as human beings.

&gt; Occupation is immoral and illegal.

More so then sending people to being bullied, being subject to pogroms and maybe even butchered?
What you are suggesting is no more immoral or illegal under the UN and international law (regarding refugees, revoking citizenship and more).

&gt; One more thing, the Palestinians who lost everything will have to go back and rebuild and start over, and its only fair that the Zionists should go back to their place of Origin and start over.

Maybe we should go to 1870's? See where everyone was back then? Maybe we should go back to the Ottoman rule and bring back everyone that the British threw out? And you think these Palestinians were here from the beginning of time? Many came during the Ottoman Rule, maybe we should see where they came from and throw them back as well! What makes '48 so magical?

&gt; There are Jews that Stand by the Muslims and argue that the Zionist state of Israel is 100 percent wrong, and they can prove that they lived in Palestine before the land thefts of Zionism started.

And there are Muslims that stand up against and argue that the state of Israel has a right to exist. And I can prove that Jews lived in Israel before this whole 'Muslim' thing even started.

&gt; and those who came under the banner of Zionism have tried to destroy all former bonds between the two

Except the Muslims that have treated Jews with strong anti antisemitism almost since their rise? (Like is quite plainly stated in the Qur'an?)

&gt; but the one's who have a longer attention span than just what happened in 1948 can tell you that the Jews in Palestine were only 3% of the population before the Zionist Machinations begun.

And if you read historical documents from the early 1800's from the narratives of historians who passed through this area you would see that it was mostly barren and the influx of Arabs/Muslims happened only towards the end of the 1800's.

In reality, I doubt this would happen. I suppose the most obvious one would be the worlds military research branches would immediately begin fashioning new super-weapons based on anti-matter, assuming we can cheaply create more as needed.

I expect NASA and ESA would begin exploratory flights, around our solar system, maybe to the nearest star but it would be slow going. Just because we have the means to travel faster than light doesn't mean we'd be ready for it. There would be a lot of tests I think on the effects of FTL travel on the human body.

Warp technology would be sold down to the mega-corporations who would then fashion a fleet of craft to work inside the solar system, flying to various moons and asteroids to claim mining rights in order to sell materials and minerals acquired from these places. 

I would speculate that as time went on territorial disputes would arise over which nations claim what throughout the solar system, though without significant advances in terraforming, beyond mining and the furthering of science setting down on other planets within the solar system would be worthless.

So let me break this down. 

1.) The church, through the Pope himself, encouraged Galileo to publish and discuss his hypothesis so long as he positioned it as a hypothesis, one of many plausible explanations for an observed phenomena. 

2.) Galileo, probably without any malice, managed to grievously offend the Pope by portraying him as foolish in the resulting book. 

3.) Having offended the Pope Galileo lost his protection. This created an opportunity for Galileo's enemies and detractors an opportunity to silence him.

4.) For largely political reasons Galileo was tried for Heresy. Having made an enemy of the Pope, who had supported him in discussing his ideas, having offended both scientists and religious parties with his radical new ideas, and having given his enemies the perfect opportunity to dispose of him, he was sentenced to house arrest and his publications were suppressed.

This is not simple. This is not easy. This is not at all like what you read in the History books. History does not and cannot conform to the ideological battles of the present. And in laying the conflicts of the present over the affairs of the past you debase yourself and cheapen your own beliefs. 

PS - Aquaducts are pretty cool. Christendom lost the technology. Then they invented shit like Flying Buttresses, in the 10th century, before the Crusades and during the height of the ""Dark Ages"". 

[Medieval Technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_technology#Agriculture)

Look at this. A lot of it seems obvious to us... Because we've been living with it for a thousand years. But shit like the heavy plow and the horse collar were revolutionary. They totally changed the landscape of Europe, allowing for higher population density and better food security. 

To the rest of you: 

This attitude, full of righteousness, confident in the Justice of it's position, and lacking an adequate background and understanding of the facts and complexities of the case, is exactly the kind of thing that makes religion so dangerous. 

Religion is not the belief in gods and demons. It is the adherence to a culturally significant ideology and belief system that defines the nature of the world. 

Secular Humanism, Progressivism, and other scientifically aligned belief systems strive for a world view in which rational inquiry is paramount, beliefs are second to evidence, and reality is accepted as being governed by fixed rules which can be revealed and understood through observation and experiment. Key to this system of beliefs is the ability to set aside old ideas in light of new evidence. 

The ""Dark Ages"" and the bugbear of a deeply technophobic Catholic Church that actively sought to supress scientific progress are just the sort of ideas that need to be set aside. These concepts arose out of the deeply flawed and limited historical investigations of the 19th and 20th century. We have much better evidence now. We can now say with confidence that the situation was not simple.

The Christian Church of the 4th through 16th centuries was made up of an enormous area covering most of Europe. It included millions of people, dozens of competing ideologies, numerous warring nations, vast cultural and religious syncretism, cultural exchange with Vikings, Rus, Goths, Huns, Muslims, Byzantines, Mongols, and others. What the Church did in Italy in 900ad is vastly different from what was done in central Gaul (Carolingian Renaissance), Ireland (monks preserving ancient texts), North Africa (Yes, there were Christians in Africa) and China (Yes, there were Christians in China. Nestorians, I believe.) 

Reducing this vast cultural diaspora, covering three continents, spanning a thousand years, encompassing tens or hundreds of millions of lives, to a mere statement ""Christianity is incompatible with science."" is foolish, shortsighted, dogmatic, and, in light of the available evidence, absolutely false. 

We strive to a better understanding of the world. We dismiss religion because we believe that evidence does not support religious claims. Religion is not an enemy. There are no enemies in Science, only discredited hypothesis and supplanted theories. ",True

Look, for the most part, Kucinich is one of the most likeable US politicians to me. But he is not perfect and in this case he actually did things which make me reconsider my position about him. The Saif al-Islam business is the most glaring. 

But I am not from the US. I'm from a minor European member of NATO. Our military did not lift a finger yet he wants to start proceedings against us somehow? What gives?

I've read my fill of Derchowitz, &amp; Benny Morris even though I staunchly disagree with their perspective on the issue.  Defining what anti-Semitism is not is much more feasible than defining what it is.  There will always be a level of subjectivity due to the very personal nature of racism, &amp; due to the somewhat vague understanding of modern Judaism.  With many defining themselves as Jews (even if they are atheists) the line between race &amp; religion becomes blurred.  There are Arab Jews, European Jews, Ethiopian Jews, all different races with one religion, &amp; in their case anti-Semitism would be discrimination against their religious identity.  For many Ashkenazi &amp; other types of Jews who no longer believe or practice the basic tenants of the Jewish religion, anti-Semitism would be an affront to their cultural identity.  Despite the somewhat vague nature of its definition, I cannot see criticism of a State's policies as anti-Semitism.  Saudi Arabia claims to be a Muslim state, but criticising their policies in not Islamaphobic (regardless of how oppressive &amp; ass-backwards most of their policies are).    

Here is [Noam Chomsky's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky's_political_views#Views_on_anti-Semitism) take on anti-Semitism, I tend to agree with it:

&gt;I grew up with anti-Semitism in the United States. We were the only Jewish family in a mostly Irish- and German-Catholic neighborhood, which was very anti-Semitic and pretty pro-Nazi. For a young boy in the streets, you got to know what that meant. When my father was first able to get a secondhand car in the late 30s, we drove to the local mountains and passed hotels that said ""restricted"" meaning ""no Jews"". That was just part of life. When I got to Harvard in the 1950s, the anti-Semitism was so thick you could cut it with a knife. In fact, one of the reasons MIT is a great university is that people like Norbert Wiener couldn't get jobs at Harvard-it was too anti-Semitic-so they came to the engineering school down the street. That was anti-Semitism. Now, it's a very marginal issue. There is still racism, but its anti-Arab racism which is extreme. Distinguished Harvard professors write that Palestinians are people who bleed and breed their misery in order to drive the Jews into the sea, and that's considered acceptable. If some distinguished Harvard professor were to write that Jews are people who bleed and breed and advertise their misery in order to drive Palestinians into the desert, the cry of outrage would be enormous. When Jewish intellectuals who are regarded as humanist leaders say that Israel ought to settle the underpopulated Galilee-meaning too many Arabs, not enough Jews-that's considered wonderful. Violent anti-Arab racism is so prevalent that we don't even notice it. That's what we should be worried about. It's in the cinema, advertising, everywhere. On the other hand, anti-Semitism is there, but very marginal.

And for folks who think Green Technology is the economic savior, be advised you probably don't understand enough about how innovation and technology works to really understand what you are hoping for.  

Grean Tech **is** one of the few ""shots"" the US has for a technology solution to either Peak Oil or to economic recovery, but pretty much everything else assures that placing those bets will be losers despite anything the entrepreneurs actually have or can do that is ""right on the money"".  

The ecosystem for engineering, manufacturing and technology innovation is badly, badly damaged by short-term thinking and emphasis on FIRE business profits and bailouts.

BTW: I'm an engineer involved in the upstream technologies for solar PV.

Why is this happening?  Well apparently no one bothers to actually look at numbers anymore.

[Asia’s Share of PV Cell Production to Reach 85% in 2011](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/k1h1b/asias_share_of_pv_cell_production_to_reach_85_in/)

These are the upstream suppliers to companies like SpectraWatt, the subject of the article.

And then what about the customer base for companies like SpectraWatt?

[Europe's share of PV product installations reached 79% in 2010](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/k1hf4/europes_share_of_pv_product/)

So notice the primary suppliers and customers are not even in the US so as a matter of supply chain logistics, you have to fly to Asia for everything and as a matter of sales logistics, you have to fly to Europe for everything, just to survive.  Your upstream and downstream supply chains are outside of your immediate geography.

The mostly logical start-up decision would have been to co-locate with suppliers in Asia or co-locate with customers in Europe.  The US is the last place to locate.  As ""logical"" as setting up in South America or Africa, which would be obviously ""not so much"".

You can bitch and complain about this.  You can beat your chest ineffectively and yell ""USA! USA! USA!"" but that all changes NOTHING.  The simple facts of reality are thus: America has *already* fallen way behind in technology related to Green Energy - this is evidence.  

You make a reality-based choice or you make a fantasy/faith-based choice.  Which one do you really think will work out better?  

I *know* in Washington DC there really are folks who completely believe the latter does - they think if you can will reality to be what you want it really will become reality.  In another age, these folks were simply and quickly locked up in sanitariums and asylums but today they run the US government and Wall Street.

I *know* there are also ""economists"" who claim you don't need manufacturing. They are 100% wrong because this is what happens when you don't manufacture.  If you don't play the game, you can't win at it.

**Manufacturing is the only economic activity that has the means, motive and opportunity to commit technological innovation.**

So, yes, the US must manufacture but the ways that has been pursued (or more accurately, randomly allowed to go fallow), will never work because there are deep structural reasons why this situation of supply and demand disintermediating the entire US has occurred.

After the shootings and the strange men following my girlfriend around and the being stuck without air conditioning for two or three weeks in the middle of a Texas summer, I was stuck with a roach motel that was charging double what was in the contract (convenient payment errors through their online vendor), with a $300 parking ticket, and with a rather nutty now-ex whose brother was threatening to kick my ass because she got high and decided that I was an assassin because I'm European and wouldn't pee in front of her (as I didn't have to pee, not because I'm European). 

So I trashed the place. I trashed it in ways that they still have to be cleaning up. I duct taped cheese and meat to the underside of things and turned off the air conditioning. I filled the bathtub with condiments and then with water. I mutilated the walls, turned the perishable-stocked fridge and freezer off, barricaded the door in such a way that it wouldn't open after I shut it and the windows in such a way that breaking them would be the only way into the flat. Then I left in the middle of the night and walked out on the bulk of my lease.

These were bad, exploitive people. I'm not normally a vicious person in any right, but I love knowing that I got my revenge to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars in damages with absolutely no recourse available to them (voided my renter insurance a week prior, not a US citizen, any contact information I gave them was throwaway or looped endlessly).

Here's how I fixed it:  
1) Do not run the repair tool (as some LoL forum posts indicated), it will cause you to redownload most of the patches.  
2) Change your network connection settings to use google's public DNS server instead of your ISP's.  
[How to switch to Google DNS](http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using.html). Since this worked for me, it's likely that some ISPs have bad DNS entries for the LoL servers for some reason (LoL switched IPs without updating public DNS entries, blah blah I forget the network details exactly... something like that). For the record, my ISP is Broadstripe.
Hope this helps.

Here is what I said:  

&gt;Regarding the article: whatever it ignores or doesn't ignore is certainly something you can discuss and critique. That you disagree with it, doesn't make it ""an anti-Semetic article."" You don't see the difference between critiquing an article and labeling it racist because it doesn't fit your narrative?

&gt;Regarding Sailer's quote, I have much of the same criticism-- he doesn't at all deny the Holocaust. You are crossing a line here, particularly with that quote you cited to. One should be allowed to make an intellectual argument with the regards to the details of an historic narrative without being tagged a racist. That you would characterize Sailer's concern over the use of the words ""near annihilation"" to him being a ""Holocaust denier"" is utterly absurd.

The ""same criticism"" I was referring to was the critique I had of your analysis of the article, which is to say: ""whatever it ignores or doesn't ignore is certainly something you can discuss and critique. That you disagree with it, doesn't make it 'an anti-Semetic article.'""  Meaning of course you have the right to agree or disagree with the points raised by the article and Sailer's comments but you should make those disagreements known without labeling them ""anti-Semitic.""

And what was it that Sailer said that was so offensive by the way?  He acknowledged a Holocaust and he acknowledged 6 million Jews died in the Holocaust.  All he claimed was that the Holocaust did not wipe out Europe's Jewish population and he based this on the claims of numbers of current Jews claiming to be Holocaust survivors versus the number of Jews said to have been killed by the Holocaust.  I have never made any kind of study or analysis of these issues, so I have no real opinion one way or another.  

How is what Sailer said racist?  Did you actually read what he said?  

If you want to genuinely engage in a discussion of this fine, but please do me a favor and engage me in a debate on the substance of the underlying issues rather than insisting I'm a racist.  I don't see the point in continuing this discussion if you insist on labeling me this way.  ",True

the *funny\** thing is that the problem is exactly the opposite. there are companies that ship food to africa, sell it there cheaply and destroy the local markets and farmers in the progress.

* the exported food comes from either overproduction, which is possible due to agricultural subsidies. afaik, lots of subsidies are based on production volume (but i'm no expert in that field, so that may not be true (anymore)) , so companies produce more than they can sell on their home markets and dump the rest for almost nothing on african markets (almost nothing is better than completely nothing).

* or it's the parts rich westerners (like us) don't want to eat. europeans love their chicken breasts, but the other parts ... not so much. so they (and the brazilians) ship a lot chicken legs to africa and sell it there for a lot less - around 2/3 to 1/2 the price of local chicken. the icing on the ace is that a lot of the cheap european dumpster meat goes bad on the way and poisons the customers. people are to poor to buy local chicken, local chicken farmers go broke: more poor people. poor people become sick because of spoiled meat: can't work, earns even less.

First thing, if my clothes are not matched to the period, I would make my clothes ragged, cover them with mud (to hide the material and design), and give myself a mugged look, so when asked I can claim to be a tradesman/traveler who was robbed/beaten.

That would make faking a name/place of origin much easier. Hard to claim you're from Westeros if you sound like a Pentoshi. Then I could offer to do some basic services/work, in exchange for food &amp; clothing. 

Once cleaned up, I can go to the next village over or start my new life there, as I ""try to remember who I am and how I learned what I know"". This also gives cover for not having a ready knowledge of local custom, slang, and various traditions.

Once I have some trust, or arrive at a new village, I would offer my services as a builder of structures and improvements to existing structures: reinforced concrete, notching/interlocking stone-work, canted plinths, round towers, shingles in place of thatch, insulation, caulk, stoves, etc.. up to late 18th century Europe levels. Not all at once or all in the same place, appearing to know too much can make people nervous.

I would introduce things like boiled water or refined alcohol subtly, describing it as a ""traditional medicine/practice from my village/town"", boiling water/distilling alcohol with something harmless sprinkled in it can make it more believable. If I can extract enough alkali's from hardwood ashes, I might  make bleach of some sort, or at least lye soap. These would get a reasonable amount of money, spread helpful knowledge but (hopefully) not enough to become a threat to anyone's lively-hood.

I'd experiment to see if charcoal can be made or a source of coal found (IIRC neither is mentioned in the books). If so, it won't take black-smiths long to start taking advantage of the increased heat, thus giving them better steel with an higher carbon content. It would also be a boon to mining operations in smelting/refining metal-bearing ores and could lead to the introduction of nikel, zinc, others, and various alloys you cannot produce with wood-fire-heat. Once I have a reasonable amount of $$, I would quietly collect components to see if I can produce basic explosives (gunpowder, nitroglycerin (if the above lye idea works), incendiaries, etc.., Most of which would be fairly primitive but, if chemistry works, I can then start small selling the magical material to mine operators, or quarries. Maybe the occasional, very discrete, sale to an ambitious lord.  

The key would be to spread (sell them the ""secret"" of how to do/make) enough knowledge to make a tidy bit of $$, then move on to another town, change my appearance and name, this will help avoid catching unwanted attention from a greedy lord, a jealous maester, or angry priest. I would hope to make a few close/trustworthy friends to travel with me until we are wealthy enough to retire, preferably someone that can teach me enough swordsmanship to survive an attempted robbery along the road.

 The constant travel and new places would suit my nomadic spirit and not being tied to a particular faction would make it easier to slip away when war comes near. Having a lord/patron would have some advantages but I'm bad enough at office politics to know I need to stay very far from win-or-die politics of Westeros.

tl/dr; I would fire all of my guns at once and explode into space.

Jusqu'à récemment l'âge de consentement était de 14 ans, et si on remonte plus loin l'âge adulte était de 15 ans, même au Canada (en Nouvelle France du moins). 

De plus, la définition scientifique de la pédophilie en tant que maladie mentale relève de la communauté scientifique, pas de la législature. Si on lit le ICD-10 où DSM-IV, on trouve que la pédophilie est déifinie comme une attirance sexuelle constante envers des enfants prépuberts (en générale, 13 ans et moins). 

Donc, la dame en question, dans un procès, pourra être accusé d'aggression sexuelle du fait qu'elle a eu des relations avec un mineur, c'est-à-dire que *selon la loi* un mineur ne peut pas consentir à des relations sexuelles avec un adulte. Mais elle ne sera jamais condamné comme pédophile, parce qu'aucun psychiatre n'est assez con pour ne pas savoir faire la différence entre quelqu'un qui est attiré par un jeune homme plein de testostérone et quelqu'un qui est attiré par un enfant qui mouille encore son lit.

&gt;Alors oui, quelqu'un qui aggresse sexuellement un enfant a inévitablement une attirance probablement sexuelle envers celui-ci, et ça fait de lui un pédophile.

Cette affirmation est complètement ridicule. Lisez plus haut. Selon la loi, toute relation sexuelle d'un adulte avec quelqu'un en bas de l'âge de consentement commet une agression sexuelle puisque ces derniers ne peuvent pas **légalement** consentir. Il y a cinq ans, quelqu'un de quatorze ans pouvait consentir. Maintenant, seulement des adultes peuvent consentir à d'autres adultes. Pourtant, seulement la loi a changé, pas l'habileté ou non à consentir des ados dans les faits.",True

While one could negate the entire premise of the post by showing how most private non-profit colleges are doing just fine, unlike newspapers, I'll give some direct critiques. Here's a few problems with it:

1. **Costs are going up isn't a problem** - While this is true, its not because hiring a professor or buying classroom space has becoming insanely more expensive. Colleges are now in an amenities war to attract the best students. New gyms. Nice dorms. Big science buildings. These have nothing to do with being unable to take advantage of the reduced cost of learning. American universities are far different than the rest of the world for the self-sufficient communities they are. There's a reason there aren't any European/South American style commuter schools at the top of the elite universities list. Its because students want to go to places that are really enjoyable to live for 4 years and pay for it. 

2. **Price =/= Cost** Colleges have increased tuition mostly because they've found that people can and are willing to pay more. They've found formulas that allow them to price descriminate very well and capture as much as a person can pay, which they've found is pretty darn high. They could charge less tuition, but why do that when they can add more to the endowment and build a new building with the proceeds.

3.**The point of college** - Mr. Harvard seems to have no clue what makes colleges like his his alma mater great. Its not professors who do great research or some curriculum that they teach differently or great education technology. Its the fact that a few thousand of the worlds smartest 12-22 year olds are interacting and living in close quarters every single day, consciously or subconsciously learning, bouncing ideas off each other, etc. 

Reading a newspaper online is more or less the same as reading one in person. Newspapers have slightly held on because there are some people that value the feel of a physical newspaper. 

Colleges are in no way the same thing as newspapers. The online version isn't a substitute for the physical one. Yglesias certainly could have watched his Harvard lectures over the internet, turned his paper in electronically, and lived in the woods in Montana. He wouldn't be nearly the same person without the peer effects elite colleges bring.

It's arguably the largest cap asset class that exists (outside of fraudulent debt derivatives of course :P). People seem to forget this. It's a difficult asset class to understand because you can't just buy it at the click of an internet broker. Because of that lack of understanding they are averse to it.

What I'm waiting for is a significant enough bust, and going into class B properties. These are properties that stray away from the suburbs into smaller towns and are better suited to lower incomes. I may use one unit of the 2-3-4plex to live in and rent out the rest, build my equity. These properties are nice because they don't appreciate or depreciate as sharply as the suburban median houses do.

It's been said that when these properties start to live, people have to live somewhere. They will move somewhere that accommodates their budget best; low income properties. Real Estate is interesting because it's an asset class you can go long in either a bull or bear market. You just have to be in the right type of real estate. That's the trick.

The reason why Real Estate is easy to get a loan for is because there's collateral! The lenders actually have something physical. That's the x factor to building wealth is how easy it is to leverage for a cashflow investment.

As for equities though I do disagree. It's been a dead cat bounce since 2008; inflation has just masked the gains XD compared to gold and silver, their doors have been completely blown off over the last 10 years. I still find them to be fundamentally overvalued, given their ridiculously high PE ratios and pitiful dividend yields on the indexes, along with what appears to be a deflationary dip. Banks especially. They're the ones that get whacked in a deflationary environments like a mafia target. Just look at all the european banks. Societe Generale, Bank of Ireland, National Bank of Greece, they've all fallen apart. The last crash in August we haven't had, since 2008. a 15% drop in such a short time frame. These banks refuse to give in for the mistakes they forced the public to eat, and because of it, god knows how many unforeseen consequences will come to the market.

I would only long stock with put options, and I'm long precious metals primarily because every other asset class (Stocks, bonds, real estate) is intoxicated with malinvestment and excessive leverage, as well as fraud and counter party risks across the board.

But the coup in Iran was completely created by foreign players, there was no serious talk of coup until Kermit Roosevelt and his team started planning, unlike the protest and crackdown that followed any talk of international involvement. You *could* argue that the protest were the result of NATO machinations but rebels seem to be equally made up of everyday citizens along with disgruntled generals and politicians. The Iranian coup was largely carried out by a handful of soldiers and military officers.

 Also Mossedegh was in the process of nationalizing the countries oil which would greatly cut into BP's (yes, *that* BP) profits, the company that pretty much had full control of Iran's oil and would pay rent on the wells. It was a really shitty deal for the Iranians as 70+ percent of the profits were leaving the country and the money that stayed in was largely going to individuals that appeased the British oil industry.

 From my understanding, Gaddafi cut some pretty rad deals with western oil companies in the last few decades, especially in Europe so its not like there was oil the west wasn't getting their hands on, in fact, I would argue that NATO countries were putting a lot the line by providing air support to this spontaneous and haphazard rebellion if oil was the chief concern. 

I have doubts about the legitimacy of this article as the NTC said just Monday that they would ""honor all existing oil contracts"" as-is (even from countries that were either neutral or supported Gaddafi). I don't know what percentage of Oil goes to France already but 35% seems more like the number for all Oil exports to Europe that already exist, so some contracts would have to be switched around if France was to get a better deal. 

IMHO the first real test of how stable the NTC is will be how they assimilate the Gaddafi Regime, like if it will be near seamless or if there will be Chzek style witchhunts for years to come.

Post:

At Gamescom, I had the opportunity to discuss the CE with the EU Namco team, who were more than happy to spell out EXACTLY how it's going to work.

The reason for the confusion is that the EU and US are getting slightly different things.

The US Collectors Edition consists of a metal case, with digital collectables, possibly a physical soundtrack and/or artbook. Because of the size of the metal case, the strategy guide has to be digital too.

The EU Collectors Edition is a folding cardboard-ey thing, you know what I mean. However, it comes with a physical making-of/behind the scenes thing, a physical art book, a physical soundtrack and a code for a digital strategy guide, because it made no sense to make two different guides for two different regions (looking at you, Atlus).

I will double check and update to see if the US one has any physical collectables, it's possible it doesn't.
Also worth noting is the fact that the EU version comes with codes for the digital versions of the art book/soundtrack etc as well as the physical ones.

As for alternative fuels in everyday transportation, it was actually private industry that destroyed the electric car back in the 90's.  There was a great documentary I watched called ""Who Killed the Electric Car?""  Some great digging was done in that documentary.  There's also another one more recently called ""Fuel"" (I think that was what it was called anyways) which talks about biodiesel being both easier and cheaper while having almost no environmental effects compared to gasoline.

*Note*:  I'm not an environmentalist per se, but I do not see logic, only greed, in why we as humans continue to harm the environment when we have the technology to not do it, while at the same time that technology is very affordable.  You have countries in Europe who are going to off of oil almost completely (save for the stuff that's used in plastics and everyday items) by 2030.

Homosexuality: This is hit on much harder in the Bible, a beast that Mormons enter into a lot more tentatively, well aware of the copious edits and alterings, as well as some just being not inspired by God. I'm comfortable with saying it is, yes, a sin, although nowhere near as much as it's hammered on. I don't see it as any worse than someone with a drinking problem or violent tendencies, it's not a guaranteed hell like it's so often pushed into by people. (Hell being another idea Mormons have a different opinion on.) This is probably the strongest thing that I have against the religion.

**Now the black priesthood ban is a very common misinterpretation.** First of all, it wasn't a sweeping ban against anyone with dark skin, several groups of blacks were holding positions within the church before the ban was removed. (Specifically in India, Philippines, and Aboriginals in Australia) If you look into it it said that the progression from gaining the gospel started with Jews to the Americans then Europeans and obviously the final removal of restrictions there in the 80s.

The reason for the ban is a curse put upon a specific bloodline from ancient times. Only a few specific bloodlines were blessed with being able to hold the priesthood(basically a position of power, the ones who could are typically referred to as ""The 12 Tribes of Israel""). That ban was later removed in the 1980s. Before then that group could still *join* the church I believe, although just not hold any position of power within it. Many were attending sessions and wanted to receive it soon before the ban was removed.

Agreed there. The Church definitely did not speed science along, nor did it sit idly by. But when we discuss why scientific thought (which I'll date to Copernicus and Vesalius by convention) only arose relatively recently, I don't think the Church is the main reason why. A force hindering its growth? Yes. A force preventing its creation? Not exactly.

I don't think the development of science is more likely under a nonreligious society. By my understanding, science itself does not seem to require much as a strict prerequisite to be invented: it needs empirical thought, it needs rationalism, and it needs experimentation. Accurate measuring tools of some sort and a system of mathematical reckoning are probably also necessary.

Those conditions are pretty easy to meet. There have been many societies of varying degrees of religiosity in human history; most since antiquity have had all of those preconditions. Yet most societies didn't invent science; they just had philosophers who looked at the world and philosophers who thought about the world and they were on equal footing. We can look back at old star charts and astronomical predictions and say, ""look, here is science,"" but keep in mind that those were used purely for astrology. They were used to support a superstitious worldview, not to build a new worldview on the basis of the evidence.

And that's what I'm trying to say, I think. The biggest impediment to science is not a malign church censoring thought; it is the human tendency to believe that what you already think is true regardless of what you learn. When people discover things that conflict with their worldview, their natural inclination is not to go back and make a new worldview, their inclination is to make it somehow fit together and go merrily on with their lives. Tradition, religion, and other forces of social conservatism certainly support this process, but aren't the only things driving it.

So why didn't science emerge except in Europe in the 16th-19th centuries? I think the answer is because science is not something humans naturally come up with under most circumstances. Why did it at all? I think the Reformation created the perfect political and philosophical environment in which science could have been created.

Who knows, maybe technological progress sparked by state competition would have eventually created such a critical mass of data that science was inevitable. I might well be wrong. But, as is true of most people, I don't think I'm wrong.",True

1. Cern did everything they could to table and kill the CERN CLOUD experiment that supported the hypothesis that 50-100% of all global warming 98-08 was a result of the sun and its affects on clouds. European governments worked very hard to try and kill this research that would undermine the profitable and politically popular AGW theory. If you are interested in AGW, you probably did not hear about this theory. It is not surprising if that is the case. 

2. In 09 the CRU was busted for fudging their data - which they referred to as ""hiding the decline"" in order to create a temperature graph that was more amenable to their position than would be provided by using actual temperature data.

1. Christian domination was not the cause of the Dark Ages; it was a response to the complete collapse of all society and order with the decline and fall of Roman power. For economic and political reasons, Europe went from being citizens of a lawful, centralized government that maintained public works to being subjects of illiterate local warlords obeying no law but brutal force. There was a social vacuum, which the Church filled. I think it did a pretty good job of doing that for the first 700 years or so, but that's a discussion for another time.

2. The Roman empire wasn't really doing science. It did technology all right, but most Roman technology wasn't lost in the West--and nothing was lost in the East, which continued all the splendor, intrigue, art, philosophy, and militarism of the Roman Empire until 1453. The Byzantine Empire as we now call it (they just called it Rome) was enormously wealthy, enormously cultured, and supported art and thought while Western Europe stagnated in petty wars. It likely spent more on intellectual development and stimulation than any civilization short of China. However, it produced virtually no science, no art, no literature, and no philosophy that we care about today. It did little but rehash past glories in thought and in art, and devoted what creative energy it had to bickering incredibly pointless, tedious, and obscure points of metaphysical philosophy. It is impossible to read about Byzantine history and not marvel that the most splendid empire on Earth was torn apart several times, with riots and mass revolts, over the finer distinctions of ""depiction,"" ""veneration,"" and ""worship"" as regards icons.

If ""you has"" becomes acceptable instead of ""you have,"" then where do you draw the line? Where is the line between English and not-English? 

I think the issue is far more politically charged than linguistic - cultural relativists who are reluctant to admit that one thing is better than another versus more absolutist leaning people who believe in immutable standards by which to measure human actions. 

I don't necessarily think that the second group's ""immutable standards"" are necessarily derived from religion, although in most cases it seems this way. I, for example, believe that we are ingrained with a certain social moral code that has evolved in humans to facilitate social living - there are huge benefits to being able to effectively participate in society. 

I would view this case through the lens of social interaction. A language should be standardized to enable effective communication. Does one word or phrase mean the same thing to one person as it does to another? I haven't studied AAVE or linguistics so I don't really know. 

From what I can tell, AAVE does not really add anything of much value, it's more a standardization of misuse of English. Just from looking over Wikipedia it looks like the dialect provides for less accuracy than standard English, for example the following table:


Phase	Example
Past	Pre-recent	I been flown it
Recent	I done fly ita
Pre-present	I did fly it
Past Inceptive	I do fly it
Present	I be flying it
Future	Immediate	I'm a-fly it
Post-immediate	I'm a-gonna fly it
Indefinite future	I gonna fly it

AAVE seems mostly to be the product of lack of education. It's called ""African American,"" but it's obviously only spoken by those on the lowest rungs of the socioeconomic ladder. Middle class African Americans don't speak AAVE. If this is the case then I think we are doing a disservice to young AAVE speakers to encourage it. 

Just like languages adapt and are assimilated by the prevailing forces, so too are cultures and customs. In this case I would argue that AAVE is a relic of inequalities in opportunity and education between African Americans and Northern Europeans on the American continent. Let it die. Don't perpetuate it. 

But I think it's good that people are out there opposing this view. There's a healthy medium. I'm sure you wouldn't argue that words should mean whatever we want them to mean, right? That defeats the purpose of language. On the other hand trying to resist the natural evolution of language is ultimately futile. I think it's a fight worth fighting when it's a matter of preserving accuracy. For example, the word ""literally"" in popular usage recently has almost completely lost its meaning in the sense of something being literal vs metaphorical. Would you argue that this is just a natural evolution and we should allow it to happen?

The farmland *is* capable of growing crops most of the time.  And people who lived there would be fine in drought conditions if they had a working government.  But, of course, they don't.

None of Apple's patents are central to making a tablet or a smartphone, and even where Apple has been successful in court the implications have been nowhere near supporting or maintaining a monopoly. You're hyping this up bigger than it actually is.

Except that Apple received an injunction in Germany to withdraw all Samsung Galaxy Tab devices from market... and are even seeking to put legal penalties on owners that do not return their tablets.

As for whether they are central to making a tablet or smartphone... They're claiming that a thin device, flat, rectangular device, with rounded corners, comprised mostly of a touchscreen is their trade dress or design patent (depending on jurisdiction).  That covers it all.

Example:

&gt;3,457,218 (""TD218"")""for the configuration of a rectangular handheld mobile digital electronic device with rounded corners""

&gt;the configuration of a rectangular handheld mobile digital electronic devicewith evenly rounded corners [the iPhone 4]""

Those are two of the trade dress claims Apple has filed against Samsung.  Tell me Apple is not trying to use overbroad claims to block devices.  

And if you say, ""Don't use rounded corners,"" then you are being absurd.

Another ridiculous trade dress claim:

But beyond that, they are seeking injunctions against every major Android manufacturer except LG in order to block their devices from sale.  They are not suing for licensing fees, they are seeking to block the sale of competing devices.

Notably, Samsung makes the exact same phone as the Galaxy S... but with WP7 on it.  The WP7 phone, which isn't a major competitor, isn't identified in the Apple lawsuit to block the sale of Galaxy phones in Europe.

Apple is specifically using their patents and claims of trade dress to push its strongest competitor out of the markets which are the most profitable for the company.

&gt; They're obliged to by the FRAND rules they agreed to when they received essential patents that utilize standard technologies. You said it yourself: ""Samsung and Motorola can't use those patents to block Apple from using those technologies"". That's what they're doing. That's their countersuit. That's why Apple is calling it anti-competitive, because it is!

Samsung's specific legal request regarding all of their patents, including the FRAND patents, is to (aside from fees, past royalties, punitive damages, etc) enjoin Apple from continued infringement.  With regards to the FRAND patents, Apple can cease infringing on those patents by licensing them from Samsung, per the FRAND agreement.  Samsung isn't obliged to separate that out into another suit that would have the exact same prayer for relief.  Nor is the court required, because of Samsung's lumping, to treat the FRAND patents as unencumbered.

Samsung has done nothing wrong.  If the court finds that Apple is infringing on the FRAND patents then the redress will require Apple to license them (for a reasonable and non-discriminatory fee) from Samsung or fuck off.

None of this is any different than if the FRAND patents were in a separate lawsuit.  What is different is that it forces Apple to deal with them concurrently, which is inconvenient for Apple.

That inconvenience pisses Apple off and they're calling it anti-competitive... even though it isn't.  Samsung, rightfully, can request the court to determine if Apple is infringing on those patents.  If Apple hasn't licensed them (and it's apparent they haven't) then they are infringing.

As Mueller points out, the FRAND patents aren't a powerful weapon against Apple.  All Samsung can get from having a court rule on them is some money.  Samsung can't use those patents to assert a monopoly.  Apple is lying through their teeth and needs to STFU.

In the last 10 years the production actually grew by about 50%, so the production capacity is not the issue here.

Oh, it's a big issue. Libya is capable of much more. They have 10 Billion more barrels in proven reserves compared to Nigeria, and Libya is considered a highly attractive oil area due to its low cost of oil production (as low as $1 per barrel), and proximity to European markets, as well as the presence of large amounts of light sweet, which is preferred. They also have enormous stores of freshwater and natural gas.

Another important fact comes from Wikipedia: *""Most of Libya remains unexplored as a result of past sanctions and disagreements with foreign oil companies""*. Well, I guess now we can finally go exploring. 

&gt;Gaddafi wouldn't nationalize the production, the fallout for him would be far too severe and would break any favorable ties he had. I doubt any of the major players actually feared this would happen.

[According to Reuters he was definitely considering it](http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/01/21/us-libya-gaddafi-oil-idUSTRE50K61F20090121)

2. The nation-state as a word and concept came in the 18 and 19th century sure, but Sweden has in practise been one since the early middle ages. Taken from wikipedia: *""The nation-state is a state that self-identifies as deriving its political legitimacy from serving as a sovereign entity for a nation as a sovereign territorial unit.[1] The state is a political and geopolitical entity; the nation is a cultural and/or ethnic entity. The term ""nation-state"" implies that the two geographically coincide, and this distinguishes the nation-state from the other types of state, which historically preceded it.""* I would say that this pretty much defines Sweden and Sweden going back nearly a 1000 years. Here too I would say as above, words are words.

3. He does not, he do however hold a few non-party-aligned political missions of diplomatic character. He represent Sweden.

4. When counting precentages of how many are of higher education Sweden will come on top since our educational system isnt as privatized as the US system, but this also allowes for ""idiots"" to gain higher education, for good or worse. In the US it is often the political, economical and sophisticated elite who gets college-level education due to its system. In short, Sweden probably has a higher precentage of highly educated people while the US has a higher quality of said education and the people educated. I do not have a good source for this, you only need to have a basic understanding of things to draw these conclusions.

5. I do not know if you live in a big city, outer suburbs or the countryside but surely you must agree that people in bigger cities tend to have a colder attitude against others while in smaller communities there's another sense of, well community.

6. EU not a very tightly knit union really. A better comparison would be the Soviet union and DDR. While the DDR indeed was a state of its own with an own government, an own army it was still entirely under the control of Moscow, just as Oslo was under Swedish control.

2, 4, 5.  This kind of question seems to treat all Americans as one unified group of people. We are not.  This kind of simplification is something Americans are often accused of when talking about people from other countries.  The same people who condemn 'elitism' are not necessarily people who believe the USA is automatically the best in everything.


3: Answers to this are complex and controversial.  Could be that lack of opportunity in the past and present has caused African Americans to become concentrated in poor urban areas that foster criminal behavior.  Could be that racism still plays a role in law enforcement.

I am not grandmastersmaterial, anyone who'd watch me playing a bad game would easily find mistakes; My gaming isn't spectacular enough to deserve viewers. I know they'd be there, because ""HOLY SHIT TITTAYS"" but I'm not interested in that. The reason you see a lot of girls that are attentionwhores in SC2 is because that's the kind of behaviour you reward. There is no such thing as not giving female attention because they aren't ""good enough"", and for any change to happen the community itself would have to start favor skill over gender, which is unrealistic at best. Becoming even a grandmasters player is an extreme achievement (at least in my opinion) and takes a lot of practice and effort. Why bother if you can get what you want without it? In the same way, the girls that are in masters/GM will most likely not say anything, because they never wanted the attention in the first place.

Turkey has tried to enter the game through its puppet government in north Cyprus, but because the TRNC isn't a valid national entity, the move has no political impact.

You can do a shocking amount of travel without a passport - and for a long time, travel to Canada, the Caribbean, and Mexico did not require a passport.  Anywhere outside North America is a long flight - I mean, look at a map - and that type of travel can be prohibitively expensive for a lot of people.

2) I've never heard this stereotype before, ever...  Americans have that perception of the Germans and Scandinavians.  I've found most Europeans find Americans to be outgoing and funny.

3) Poverty and crime is a vicious circle, and African Americans were badly discriminated against (and thus economically disadvantaged) until arguably the last couple decades.

4) Its the same psychology that allows you to yell at your own kid, but wouldn't tolerate someone else yelling at your kid.  It's hard to listen to from Europeans in particular, given their history of racism/oppression and the fact that for all their wealth they do about diddly-squat globally for promoting human rights then lecture US intervention in hindsight.  They have some nice trains and long vacations - whatever, it's otherwise not a hugely different culture or power structure.

5) Elitism in that context refers to economic (or in some cases intellectual) elitism, and the belief that the average man is no better or worse than the 'elite' - and a country that promotes that belief is 'the best'.  Now, I'm perfectly aware that for 30+ years economic inequality has gotten way out of control and a lot of the world has caught up to or exceeded the US technologically / politically - but that hasn't exactly registered for some people out there.  See answer to question 1.

6) I guess it depends on your definition.  The FDR-era idea that a blue collar worker can get a nice white picket fence house in the suburbs and not stress about the basics of life (education &amp; health care) is one that's obviously not the same anymore as we've transitioned to a service based economy and have larger disparities of wealth (see answer to question 5) - but the larger dream of America is one of choice of lifestyle and privacy, which I think exists in the nation more than most (if not all) other western nations.",True

If we make fuel use more expensive, that *will* impact the poor more than it will the rich.

Oh, sure, we can levy taxes in the US and Europe to cut back on our usage.  Let's say that we in the US cut our emissions by 50%.  That reduces the world's budget by 2900 million metric tons.  Maybe we could get 600 MMT from Japan, 400 from Germany, 200 from the UK, 200 from France, 200 from Italy, 150 from Spain.  

In order to reduce the world's CO2 emissions, by under 5000 MMT, those 1st world countries will have to stop producing things.  We don't expend carbon dioxide for listening to our iPods, we expend CO2 in power plants and transportation.  If we are to cut our emissions by half, we've got to stop using 50% of our electricity, and stop traveling to and from work and/or shipping goods around.

So, in order to produce less CO2, the vast majority of Americans will have to drop their electricity bill, stop ~~going to~ traveling for work, and stop buying goods that have to be shipped.

I'm already there.  My Carbon Footprint is more like that of a person from a 3rd world country, but I have several advantages.  I drive less than 1000 miles per year, telecommute to work, live in a mild climate, tolerate large swings in temperature (thermostat on 85 in the summer, 55 in the winter), and I'm generally not all that impressed with material goods, so I don't do much shopping.

The problem is that I'm the minority, here.  The typical American makes half of what I do, must travel to his job (and many families have two working adults that have to travel to their jobs separately), and spends more on heating and cooling his home than I do.

So, in order to cut usage by 50%, we jack up the prices for electricity, natural gas, heating oil and transportation fuel, right?  That's the best plan.  How much of an increase in cost will be needed to cut usage?

Let's say it's 20%, just to have a number to work with.  You're right, the rich just go out to eat once less a month.  That takes care of 10% of the population.  How about the 16% of the population in the US who are now already on food stamps because they can't afford food?  How will increasing their burden by 20% affect their lives?

What about the 30% of the population who are just getting by now, who don't make enough money to put anything into savings, but are living okay?  Will a 20% bite into their usable income be able to be absorbed easily?  What will they have to do to cut back. They could stop heating and cooling their homes, or stop going to work.  Or they could stop buying extra goods and services.

What will happen to our economy if 50% of the people stop buying any goods or services that are not strictly needed for survival?  Our federal government just borrowed more than a Trillion dollars to dump into the economy because people were not spending enough money. It made just a tiny bit of difference, just enough to keep us from going into a severe depression.  

So, let's take your route and yank 20% (or more) of the income half the country needs to survive out of it just for the sake of reducing the world's CO2 budget by 10%.  You will collapse the economy and cause real harm to a minimum of 150 million people, but hey? it could reduce the temperature of the earth by 0.05 degrees, right?  Oh, wait, no.  It won't actually reduce the temperature of the earth at all, it will just slow the advance, because India and China combined produce somewhere around 9 Billion metric tons of CO2.",True

He said it wasn't uncommon for a perfectly normal, healthy, well-educated American to not own a passport. When I thought about it I realised that I've travelled to many countries all over the world and met under 5 Americans. Question: Why don't you guys travel?

A lot of people do travel, but they stay within the U.S. Our states are much like European nations, and most are much larger than one entire country (land-wise) from Europe. Our ""average"" sized state is probably the size of one of Europe's larger countries. So really traveling out of country adds quite a bit of expense (passport plus other fees). I've traveled quite a bit, and I wish more would do so. I think it would change the course of this country (and the world). 

&gt;Question 2. I've heard that Americans take themselves very seriously. Even heard the US referred to as an 'irony-free zone'. Is this true? If not, why do people say this?

I don't think so. The humor tends to be different. We tend to be more ""optimistic"" I guess (that is how I heard it put once). But I guess it depends upon the person really. I'm pretty loose and relaxed, and know plenty like me. 

&gt;Question 3. Why are there so many African-Americans in jail?

Because the police presence in their neighborhoods tends to be stronger and most live in the ""inner city"", where crime rates tend to be higher as well. So generally they don't ""get away"" with as much as ""suburban white folk"" (even though drugs tend to be just as prevalent in suburbia). 

&gt;Question 4. You readily admit your country's short-comings among one another but when a foreigner says anything against the USA, Americans tend to turn ultra-patriotic and abrasive. Why?

Because, they mistake patriotism for nationalism. I am patriotic and love my country, which is why I will openly criticize my government, regardless of who is office because I want to see my country lead the world, not compete with it.

&gt;Question 5. Why is is that 'elitism' is frowned upon, but there are no qualms about claiming that the USA is the best country in the world?

See above. That and like most people in the world, we are hypocrites. 

&gt;Question 6. Does the 'American Dream' still exist?

In my opinion, no. It has become increasingly hard to traverse the social barriers that exist (mainly financial). Most people have a crushing debt by the time they leave college (myself included), and never really escape that. Part of the reason is we have gone more towards a consumerist model. Everything has cartridges, and needs refills, or something of the sort. So you are ""stuck"" in spending all the money you just earned on material goods and debt. They say now that it is called the American Dream because you have to be sleeping to believe it.",True

2. Nothing different from what it is today, only that the election process are somewhat more democratic (or less in some cases).

In Sweden, in order to maintain power you needed the support of the farmers rather than the nobility.

That said, it is a longer trip for Americans because geographically we're a lot further away from other countries than say, Europeans or Asians.

Also, do bear in mind that the U.S. itself is a very large country and it's very possible to travel extensively without really leaving it's borders. It's very diverse no matter where you go.

- ""The irony-free zone""? Lol, that's new. But nope, I'm gonna have to disagree with you on this one. Americans are pretty funny and we love to laugh and have fun. Just look at our entertainment to see that for yourselves. As for the being too serious reputation, we definitely work hard, but I think we play way harder which makes up for that.

- As disgusting as it is to admit, there are still racial and social inequalities here in the United States. Unfortunately, African-Americans have earned a bad reputation as a result of these inequalities. In a nutshell, many African-Americans tend to be of much lower socio-economic status than other Americans. Poor people are less educated and (arguably) poorly provided for, and are therefore more prone to engaging in criminal behavior such as theft, drug-dealing, and murder. The same could be said of Hispanic-Americans or Asian-Americans, many of whom find themselves in the same category as African-Americans. **And if our government could just grow a pair, you'd see a lot more prosecution of white collar crime and there'd be a hell of a lot more white people in jail (where their self-indulgent, greedy spoiled asses belong)**.
- It's like having a little brother or sister. You can talk shit about them all you want, but if someone else says something nasty you're gonna step up and protect what you love. I readily admit my country has a lot of serious shortcomings, and I can handle a foreigner pointing that out to me. What I won't abide is commentary from someone who judges us as a whole by our gov't, who has never been to the United States, or who buys into crap about Americans just because it's cool to hate on us. It is very possible to have a productive conversation with an American about the state of our country, so long as you pay us the same respects we pay you in regards to your own home. 

- ""Elitism"" as it's referred to here in the U.S. is a talking point for political candidates who have a certain (usually more conservative) agenda. It's a way for ambitious would-be presidents to make education, success/wealth, and world-awareness seem like a bad thing. *If a person is ""elite"", how can s/he connect with the everyman, someone who struggles for what they have?* Keep in mind, there are a lot of Americans who still credit hard physical labor and straight-up Americans values for their success (we're talking farmers, laborers, ect.) and who don't necessarily believe education or worldliness is the only way towards a better life. Obama is continually referred to as an elitist because he had the nerve to go to Harvard and become a wealthy lawyer. People like Sarah Palin have convinced the blue collar worker down in the Appalachians that this is bad, because he's too smart or too rich to care for or understand their day-to-day problems. Whatever. The people complaining about elitism are the ones who continue to scrape the bottom of the barrel financially and intellectually.

- The American Dream still exists, but it's very subjective. Not all Americans want the same things. My American Dream is to continue doing what I love (I'm a teacher) for as long as I can do it. Financial success isn't really my greatest aspiration, but if I can someday buy a house and squeeze out a kid, everything's cool. Others only want money and they'll work hard to achieve that goal because it's their right to be successful. Then there's someone else hoping he or she can learn enough English to get some sort of job to provide for a family. Someone else is still trying to move here to pursue their own American Dream.

1. Europe is tiny. Going abroad is cheap and easy. America is big and if you want to travel abroad (unless you go to Canada or Mexico), it will cost you a lot of money. If you spend that much money on travelling, you want to spend a longer time there to justify the expense. Americans typically have a lot less holidays than Europeans so for them long-distance travel is a lot more difficult.

2. This is not true. There are dicks everywhere. The Americans I know all have a very good sense of irony and sarcasm (unlike the residents of a few European countries). They have a bit different style of humour than continental Europeans.

3. This is a complex question and it's a consequence of historic and cultural circumstances. The obvious, but not very helpful answer is that there are many African-American criminals who get caught by the police and/or get sentenced by the courts to prison sentence.

4. America is big, there are many different kinds of people there. Some may get offended if you start criticizing their country and get defensive. Some will jump on the bandwagon and join you bashing America. I think there are plenty of people of both types here on Reddit. Personally, I'd be pissed as well if some foreigner would start bashing my country; that's the privilege of my fellow compatriots.

Here's one article, which is open access so you can read the whole thing: [On the earliest evidence for habitual use of fire in Europe](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/13/5209.full).  They argue that fire was not a *significant* part of the human repertoire until 300,000 - 400,000 years ago.

On the other hand, you have a paper that was *just* published, also in PNAS, that says something very different.  While the study I posted above relied primarily on evidence of fire, this one looks at changes in teeth brought about by changes in feeding habits. You can look at the abstract here: [Phylogenetic rate shifts in feeding time during the evolution of *Homo*](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/35/14555.abstract?sid=1bef6c47-9562-4739-9c70-499e144c9fb6).

I am not an expert in very early man.  As far as I have an expertise in cookery, it's within the last couple thousand years, not the last couple million years.  That said, the 1.9 mya argument is convincing to me.

I think this is mainly due to the size of America, which is huge when you compare it countries in Europe or the like.  Travel to other countries isn't really a necessity for us. I, personally, have only ever been in 3 states, so it's not really a big deal to not have a passport.

2.  I don't think this is really a stereotype of America per se, but rather just something that one country naturally thinks about another. I can't think of a country that I would say doesn't take itself very seriously.

3.  Well, some are there because they messed up, but that's not the only reason.  There are certain crimes, like robbery, that have seemingly exorbitantly lengthy incarceration periods.  Crimes like these typically occur more among African-Americans. In my sociology class, we were told this is a type of institutional racism.

4.  Personally, I'm willing to admit my country's faults; however, I feel like this goes back to question 2, in that I feel like this occurs in most countries.  With a sphere of influence as big as America's, it's hard not to feel like we're great.

5.  I honestly don't know this.  I have no problem with ""elitism,"" because I don't want a plumber for a president; I want someone who admits they're capable of running a country.  I feel like elitism is a sort of media term used to demonize certain political front-runners.

6.  I would say it does, though it doesn't really happen in a way that we're proud of.  Illegal immigration is a problem, but it definitely allows people access to better lives.  I don't feel like the America Dream will die; it just won't stand out as much once other countries develop democracy or whatever it takes to make their own version of the dream.",True

Here's whats going to happen.  As the US moves to more and more draconian ""security"" measurements, another disaster is going to occur.  Be it a terrorist attack or my guess: a viral outbreak.

At the same time religious ideology is going to creep into the public conscious, causing the US to become more of a police-state theocracy.  This religious fever is going to cause political strife with the rest of the world.

Simultaneously the US's economy is going to start showing true signs of complete collapse, causing the world economy to shift away from the US.

Cue similar fiasco's as what happened in Iraq.  The US will start invading countries under the guise of ""terrorism"".  These countries will most likely be Muslim in majority.  This is going to cause a not-to-covert new crusade.  Political lines are going to be drawn, and allies are going to be confusing.  The traditional ""Western"" states are going to be split between the two.  Some are going to buy the US's terrorism line, while others are going to recognize the crusade and side against the US.

""Slowly"" other countries are going to be dragged into the conflict,  resulting in a normal world war.

From here there are one of two different results.  If the US-led side wins, the world is going to start shifting into a similar Christian theocracy.  Revolts will start rising, and as a result there is going to be a complete police-state across the world.  This will eventually fall, but not for another couple hundred years.

If the US-led side loses, there is going to be another world war.  The winning side is going to be split.

I think perhaps it might work if you had an extremely restrictive constitution that governed what laws each level could pass - eg if the world government could *only* pass laws regarding human rights and global defence/peacekeeping, that would probably be fine.

This is something I've been thinking about for a while, and I think a model where each lower level can pass ever more restrictive laws, but requires a greater degree of consensus from its population could work out really well.

Some of these states are the size of two or three other countries. IE Texas, California, Alaska. Americans tend to travel allot between states. Most Americans can't afford to fly over seas, and it's considered a very big deal if we do get to do so. 

If the USA was set up like Europe, where each state was independent and required a passport to go across boarders, then many more Americans would have a passport. However, since there is no need for it to travel between states we don't get it until we need it to travel outside of the country. If you ever get the chance to travel around the States, you will see that each state is very different geographically and environmentally, as well as the people are very different from state to state. Texans are very different then new yorkers for example. 

2. Many Americans take themselves seriously because that's the way our country operates. You have to put in the work to get what you want. However, that doesn't mean we are humorless. In fact, American are some of the nicest and funniest people you will come across. However, we don't take kindly to people who attack us in any respect. So if you aren't serious and making jokes about our country we will laugh with you. Mostly because we know it's true and can take a joke. If you are outright slandering our way of life, we will get angry.

3) This is kind of a loaded question. The majority of African Americans come from low-income neighborhoods. The American economic system sometimes makes it hard for these people to build their neighborhoods up out of poverty. The people do what they can to thrive, even if that means committing violent crimes or selling drugs. It's not right, that's just the way things are.

4) Even though our country has problems, we still love it. Not every American is like this, most want to find solutions to the issues and quietly work to do so. Often the media portrays us as flag waving maniacs, and some of us are. That however is not the majority of people in the US. 

This is our country. It may not seem like much, but it's ours. We will protect it in word and in action. Just like the people from any other country would. 

5) Elitism is a word that was constructed for people who have pride in their status. Most Americans are middle-to-lower class working people. We hate the word elite because in our constitution it says all men are created equal. However, America is a very competitive country. We love to say we are the ""best"" at what we do. We love to challenge other countries to beat us. It may come off as arrogant, and for some people it is. It's a strange double-standard that the general American Public has. 

6) The American Dream isn't dead. Most people aspire to own land, work hard, and make enough money to raise a family and have some fun. The problem is the media. It portrays the ""New American Dream"" as getting rich quick for doing little to nothing. This comes from shitty reality television like Jersey Shore, The Real World, and other MTV abominations that display spoiled children acting like spoiled children and getting paid for being spoiled children. The sensationalized view of America isn't anywhere close to what real Americans are like.

I have a passport, and I travel. I think it's safe to say that at least half of the people here have passports, but to be honest there really is no need to have one. Up until recently, Americans could travel across North American borders without passports. Furthermore, most Americans travel to other states. Our states are bigger than many countries in Europe. For instance, from Oslo, Norway to Stockholm, Sweden is the equivalent of me driving across my state (and not even exiting the state). I live in a pretty small state, too.


**Question 2. I've heard that Americans take themselves very seriously. Even heard the US referred to as an 'irony-free zone'. Is this true? If not, why do people say this?**

I'll have to agree that Americans are pretty serious, but we joke a lot too. I think it's safe to say a lot of Americans have a sense of humor. Otherwise, why would we be on Reddit? ;) And I've never heard us called ""irony-free zone"", in fact what does that even mean? Irony and humor are two separate things... are they not? They can work together or be independent of each other, you can have something funny that is not ironic and vice versa. On top of all that, Americans love to point out irony. Ironic, isn't it?


**Question 3. Why are there so many African-Americans in jail?**

Sadly, this is because we have allowed our country to enable somewhat of a police state in which - instead of addressing issues like a doctor would cure a disease, we only treat the symptoms. Instead of rehabilitating criminals and fighting crime, we are throwing people in prison and arresting them everywhere we can. Prisons have quotas to fill, and they are privately ran and financed. What does this mean? Profits. More prisoners = more profits. Furthermore, we have the most prisons in any country in the world. It's not that black people commit more crimes than white people, it's that the justice system allows more black people to goto jail than white people. Also factor in the most common occurrences of crimes these people commit, white people are statistically less likely to be involved in gang activity or drive by shootings, things of that nature (and I hope that doesn't sound racist, but it is more of a statistical thing really). But I do believe our system is very flawed (and possibly racist).


**Question 4. You readily admit your country's short-comings among one another but when a foreigner says anything against the USA, Americans tend to turn ultra-patriotic and abrasive. Why?**

When we speak negatively of our own country, it is because we have actually lived through it and been here to see it and experience it for ourselves. Most of the time when people from another place talk about people from yet another place, they are wrong (or not completely accurate, at least). Do all British people have bad teeth and eat crumpets and drink tea all day? Do all Canadians wear flannel shirts, have a pet moose, and drink maple syrup by the gallon? Those are stereotypes. The majority of things people say about America aren't facts about our countries flaws, such as ""Oh the economy is bad why don't they make more jobs"" or ""Why don't they secure their own borders instead of fighting in the Middle East"", those are legitimate flaws to point out. Instead, the usual flaws foreigners point out about us are narrowed down to the simple minded ""Der Americans are stupid and fat and only eat fast food"" or ""Americans are too serious..."". And those are stereotypes. I have been to England, and I never expected the people to fit a certain set of standards that I assumed they would have. I never expected to see people looking like Austin Powers walking around. I just saw them as regular people, whether they were from America, or England, or Morocco. Not stereotypes.


**Question 5. Why is is that 'elitism' is frowned upon, but there are no qualms about claiming that the USA is the best country in the world?**

Just because we claim to be the best country around doesn't mean we are the best country that could possibly exist, ever. It just means people think our country is better than the ones that exist currently (except possibly Switzerland). Just like you mentioned we admit our shortcomings, we know things are wrong - but we are still a lot better off than 90% of the other countries out there

**Question 6. Does the 'American Dream' still exist?**

I think deep down it exists in all of us, but most of us have made our new and own independent dreams... but they are all still pretty much the same things; just instead of a white picket fence and a house with kids, it's just the act of being successful and making something of yourself.

* If we are paid well, it's often in a city far away from our place of birth.  Couple that with our lowest-in-the-developed-world vacation time, and we wind up using vacation to see family at holidays.
* The country is so big, and there's so much to see that many people die without having seen most of it.  Add in that traveling to see family eats up about half of our vacation, it's more rewarding to just go see the Grand Canyon than take a trip to Europe (or any other country) for a week.

2.  I don't think this is true.  I'd need an example contrasting behavior in other countries to understand the question properly.

We're very self-deprecating, but maybe you mean our attitudes towards our country?  In that, we are not so self-deprecating, it's true.  Why? I'm not sure I can say, but I'd suspect it has to do with the mythology surrounding our involvement in WWI and WWII.

3.  To be clear, the majority in prison is white just like outside prison, but the ratio of minority/black to white is higher in prisons than outside.

It's big business.  If we spent the money to educate everyone properly, our crime rate would go down, but that would be money put into the government.  Instead, we leave whole segments of society, the poor, without any options save crime.  Then we spend billions on private security and private prisons to house these people.  That money goes to corporations.

Ultimately, the problems the United States have, including prison populations, boils down to being the most wealthy country on the planet.  We have so much money concentrated at the Federal level that everyone's spending money in legal bribes to get a piece of the action.  So the people suffer.

4.  It's a good question.  I could answer by saying if your sister is a whore, you might get angry and tell your friends what a whore she is, but then if your friends call her a whore, you yell at your friends.

It's also difficult to take criticism from other countries because few of them understand the amount of corruption that our wealth and power bring.  It fees a little like if a rich person looks at a poor person and says, ""Why don't you dress better?""  There's often a lack of understanding involved in the criticism.

5. You know, that's much more complicated than the question suggests.  We dislike elitism intensely in this country.  Many of us also dislike hearing people call the USA the best country in the world.  However, patriotism is the opiate of the disenfranchised masses.  Fully half of the population live below our incredibly low standard of poverty.  These people may live a life comparable to some third world countries, but by God, they're Americans!  Citizens of the Greatest Country on Earth!™

6.  You'd have to tell me what you think the American Dream is.  As I understand it, TAD is home ownership, 2.5 children and a chicken in every pot.  Is it still alive?

He said it wasn't uncommon for a perfectly normal, healthy, well-educated American to not own a passport. When I thought about it I realised that I've travelled to many countries all over the world and met under 5 Americans. Question: Why don't you guys travel?

America is fucking huge. If I want to go to the beach, mountains, or anything in between, I can usually do so while staying in the country. International travel is usually far more expensive (with the possible exceptions of Canada/Mexico), so it's more of a luxury than travel in general.

&gt;I've heard that Americans take themselves very seriously. Even heard the US referred to as an 'irony-free zone'. Is this true? If not, why do people say this?

Some do, some don't. I don't think it's very different from anywhere else. That said, I've never heard that we take ourselves especially seriously.

&gt; Why are there so many African-Americans in jail?

It started with crack in the 80s, and it's pretty hard to break out of poverty when everyone you know is also in poverty.

&gt; You readily admit your country's short-comings among one another but when a foreigner says anything against the USA, Americans tend to turn ultra-patriotic and abrasive. Why?

Sometimes my sister really pisses me off, and I'll vent to my other sister, but if a random guy off the street tells me my sister's being obnoxious, I'm going to defend her. In any case, a lot of the criticisms (at least the ones you hear about on reddit) are far too hyperbolic and often are off-base.

&gt;Why is is that 'elitism' is frowned upon, but there are no qualms about claiming that the USA is the best country in the world?

It's a remnant of our past; we still feel like anyone who is an ""elitist"" is like a European noble who doesn't have to work as hard to get what they want. Most Americans feel like you can and should do anything you want as long as you work hard, and when they feel like someone has it easier, the majority of people don't like it. As far as claiming the US is the best, I think it's pride rather than elitism. We feel like, for all of our failings, we still have a pretty damn good country, with a system of government that's designed to give us the power.

&gt;The opportunity cost of going to school is not working and passing over that income.

and

&gt;Since the loans are not available to you otherwise, the loans themselves are not opportunity cost.

We've been over this. Taking on debt - what happens when one takes out a student loan - is costly in several respects. For instance, having to make debt payments prohibits you from investing in other things, paying for other services (healthcare), etc. Try and wiggle out of it all you want, this is called opportunity cost.

&gt;At any rate, regardless of all of that, the Risk associated with a loan is not an opportunity cost, which is what you stated.

Except not really. By some estimates, our total effective tax rate is as high as 40%.

http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Taxes/Advice/YourRealTaxRate40.aspx

Americans pay taxes comparable to some Europeans countries, and then on top of that they must cover student loans plus intrest for themselves, not to mention health care and other services.

&gt;That isn't true in Europe.

What isn't true? That people with degrees don't get paid more? Your wording was awkward.

No, our entire education system is grossly inadequate to keep the US optimally competitive into the next century, and student loan debt IS a huge problem.

Is this not dressing to please others? But instead of actual physical people, it's the hypothetical person that sees you?

I suppose in the end this is just an argument by degrees, since instead of ""morphed by society"" I consider to be ""all but wholly determined by society"" (see tanning in the US/Europe vs. whitening in latin America/India, african neck lengthing, lip/ear extenders, etc.).

I think the thing that's really wrong is that somehow a desire to please others is conveyed as a sense of weakness/poor character trait. In reality all but a handful of actions that we do are truly done for the self (education, health and hygiene come to mind). Everything else we do for others sake, we say please and thank you, we don't spit on peoples rugs, we go to the bathroom in the proper location, we wear clothes at work, etc. Why is attractiveness such a thorny issue?

Many of the first settlers of the Americas were the younger sons of landed gentry in the Old world, as well as Puritan settlers who were largely outcast from Europe. In those hard times the best way to prove yourself was to be as productive as possible, and often times culture took a backseat. Fast forward 200 years, and the ideals of the French Revolution and the Enlightenment took hold in the 13 colonies, and a nation was founded on those principles (ostensibly), one of the reasons being that having a hereditary elite wasn't good for the State. In the 19th century, one of the primary forces in American Literature was the school of Transcendentalism, and authors like Ralph Waldo Emerson in his essay ""The American Scholar"" proposed the creation of a new kind of national Art, one that didn't glorify the upper classes but rather the common people and their honest struggle to survive. A lot of critics say the Walt Whitman would come to fulfill Emerson's dream. As a result, disdain for elitism has been ingrained in American culture for a very long time.

As for why we're so quick to defend it, it comes back to the fact that we *were* one of the two major superpowers on the globe for 60-70 years. Our country was able to do things no other one had done before (building the Atomic Bomb, the moon landing), or at least never done on quite the scale (the federal highway system, the Internet) and many Americans still take pride in that. **The idea is that we, as a country of equal citizens, did impressive things that we think justify the moniker of ""greatest country in the world"", so we collectively claim ownership of them and ascribe the title to ourselves**, rather than a small elite. If you listen to JFK's famous ""moon"" speech, he uses the phrase ""*We* choose to go to the moon"".

In Europe, the countries are small and close together.  They're also linked by reliable and relatively cheap rail lines.  In the US, we don't have a national public transport system to speak of - let alone an international one.  Sure, there's Amtrack and Greyhound, but they're slow and, lets face it, pretty horrible.  If you don't live in a major city, you might have to drive several hours just to get to a train station.  Unless you happen to live near a border (which will only get you to Mexico or Canada), your only good option is to fly, and that's expensive.  You could spend a day or two driving, but time off is rare enough that most don't want to waste it on travel.

 Which brings us to point number two.  All the civilized countries in the world have state-mandated paid vacation time for full-time employees - all except the US.  Most give 4-6 weeks paid vacation per year to even the lowliest retail workers.  In the US, a good chunk the workforce gets no paid vacation time whatsoever.

We do travel, but you should realize that there is an incredible difference in land mass between the United States (Almost 10,000,000 sq km) and most countries.  I don't know where you happen to live, but let's compare the US to Europe.

With a car, in Europe you can go from:
Paris to london in 5-ish hours.
Paris to Frankfurt in 6-ish hours.
Budapest to Prague in 5-ish hours.

Where I live, in Boise, Idaho... here is a map of where I can get in five hours of driving:
http://www.freemaptools.com/how-far-can-i-travel.htm?address=Boise%20Idaho&amp;speed=50&amp;time=5&amp;accuracy=15

I can *barely* leave the state in five hours.  I can drive East for more than three days and not run out of United States.

Answer 2: I don't think so.  It's hard to make a statement about 300 million people.

Answer 3: I don't know.  It's probably a mix of many things.  I would guess that it involves poverty, education, culture, desperation, and the need for politicians to appear ""tough on crime"".  Maybe also racism.  I don't know.

Answer 4:  I think it may be the same reason you fight and bicker with your siblings, but when someone else starts trouble with your brother or sister, you rush to their aid.  No one hassles family except family.

Answer 5: Is there any nation that says, ""You know, objectively we're probably the 56th greatest nation on Earth.""  Of course not.  National pride, like pride in a Sports team or anything else involves hyperbole or exaggeration.

Answer 6: The American Dream is as alive as it ever was. The problem is it's always been half-dead.  Life is hard.  Dreaming you can make life better is universal.  America just had really good marketing to make everyone thing our dreams are... better.  ;)

I'd say the majority of well-educated Americans travel.  However the majority of Americans are not well-educated.


2)  Depends on the context.  Many Americans fancy themselves as patriotic and when they perceive an attack on their politics/society by foreigners, might take umbrage initially, probably borne of the US being the prime mover in foreign policy since WWII and thus being the target of more criticism.  There are Americans who react similarly to perceived attacks on their religion or preferred sporting team.  I find this pre-disposition in foreigners as well, though perhaps Americans are a bit more touchy about religion and their role in foreign affairs.  Also if you can get the conversation past the initial feather-ruffling you'll find most Americans have deep criticisms of US politics/society/foreign policy.


3)  Socio-economic reasons and racial profiling as well as some laws that seem to be racist/classist (e.g. radical difference in how crack consumption/distribution is prosecuted vs cocaine).


4)  See 1).  I think it's also informed by the 1st amendment being sacrosanct and a combative/intrusive press.


5)  That's because we ARE the best, because Jesus was American.  J/K.  We like the idea of egalitarianism, but in practice we seem to like the rich getting richer, the poor getting poorer, limited socioeconomic mobility, and the idea that the privileged gets perks.  I think this bias transcends national boundaries though.


6)  I think 'American Delusion' would be more fitting, though mayhap I'm being a bit of a pessimist.  I think socio-economic mobility of Western Europe has surpassed that of the US primarily due to tax and social entitlement policy.

I don't understand that either. Maybe Americans just don't have that globe traveling mindset. Many might say it's because America is huge, but of course there are incredible things in Europe, Africa, South America, Asia and so on that don't exist in the US, so that seems like an incomplete answer.

2. I would say the opposite is the case. I think Americans are into being proper and having good manners, but joking around is very common.

3. Very tough question. A big part are laws, like high punishments for drug possession, that primarily hurt the poor and black Americans are on average poorer and less well-educated than whites. If one is to be fare, racism probably plays a part in it, as white cops seem to target young black men.

4. I think it's like a family member. You might say your older brother is an asshole, but if someone else says it you stick up for your older brother. Beyond that I think Americans might be more patriotic than some other countries, even if they do criticize America.

5. I'm not sure. Maybe it is because Thomas Jefferson, an influential thinker in American history, and many others thought the decadence and ceremony of Europe were unnecessary so they were less formal. Nonetheless that seems like an incomplete answer.

6. Not really. Many foreigners, like Indians are only coming here for degrees and going back home for work. I would say the chances of getting educated and having a dignified career are the lowest they have been in the US in at least 50 years. I would say the real American dream probably officially died  for most sometime in the 70s and it was probably best for Americans in the 50s. Of course in the 50s that only included white men.

2) Yes. I can't find the poll, but I read once that when polled about whether or not they thought they were someone important, something like 20% of teenagers in 1950 said yes. In that same poll today, something like 85% said they were someone important. That pretty much sums it up.

3) a) Black people are oppressed and poor. [25.8%](http://www.infoplease.com/spot/bhmcensus1.html) of African-Americans live in poverty vs. [10.8%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_American) of white Americans. Even having a [""black name""](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/09/29/national/main575685.shtml) means less chance of advancing in the workplace. Low income means greater crime. Crime means jail.

4) We are a great country. After spending time in Europe, I must say, there are some real fuck heads out there. Seeing how women are treated around the world is pretty sobering. That being said, we're violent, dumb, and fat, so I think I'd still rather live in Europe.

5) Hypocrisy is a deeply rooted American tradition. 

6) Yes. It's just that dreams don't come true. The only way to win in America is to figure out a way to scam people out of their money or entertain them. From finance to IQ tests, scams are pervasive. In entertainment, it's the National Football League and drugs. No one wants to invest in things that make things better or more awesome. 

I think a great deal of what this comes down to is this: We're fucking lazy. Most people I know don't actually want to *do* anything - they want to get wasted on a beach with a sexy lover and live out their days staring at sunsets. The only ambition they have seems to stem from that desire - get money, get sexy lovers, get beach, get drinks with umbrellas, be happy. Or the other group that thinks the only way to happiness is a few kids, a house, a dog, and a quiet life in the suburbs. In America, being a parent is an ""accomplishment,"" not unlike finishing college or owning a company. I know very few people who think, ""I want to revolutionize X industry and transform people's lives."" Maybe people have some half-assed idea for a product or service that could actually improve things, but no one ever does anything with them. I posted a thread about high speed rail a while back and a lot of the comments were like, ""fuck trains, i got me a car."" Instead of trying some new (better) way of traveling, they'll stick to the old way. Lazy. Hell, we're even too lazy to vote. We have so very few genuine moguls - people who want to be the head of an empire for the sake of the people and not themselves. If you just want to be Steve Jobs so you can sit on a beach all day, you don't actually want to be steve jobs.

I know people are going to jump on me that they're actually to ""busy"" - but from what I see, people don't know what busy means. I worked two jobs, took 20 credits in college, and still had time to make music, draw, write, and watch basketball. Oh and for a while there, I didn't have a car, so I rode my bike 20 miles (that's like 32km) a day. 

So it's not like all Americans are that way. It's just that a lot of our middle class is that way, and it's causing their slow decline to lower class. The mechanism for advancement is there, but no one is going to hand you something, which is something American's have a lot of trouble with. And that's not a swipe at liberals (I am a liberal). I think the biggest thing is, even if you had someone an opportunity, they're too lazy to take it. That's a problem.

I think computing power continuing to accelerate is an assumption, but a reasonable one, based on the lessons of history. A crisis not slowing it down is also a reasonable assumption; wars and crises in the past haven't slowed down progress worldwide.

Flying cars aren't technologically that difficult- you can build one yourself for about the price of a luxury sedan- they're just impractical. You still have to have a pilot's license, and take off from an airport.

The things I'm most skeptical about are the timeline- we should be able to make pretty good projections about raw computing power, but Kurzweil's predictions on things like social technologies, advances in AI software, and nanotech are going to be less accurate- and whether strong AI is actually possible in principle. I think the fact that *we're* intelligent should be proof enough that artificial intelligence is possible, and most of the traditional arguments for why the human brain is special are bunk, but there are questions like, *is our intelligence Turing computable?* that cause me to pause a little bit.

1. Most people I know don't own a passport. I do and my wife does, but out of all of the people I know, I think only 4 or 5 people have ever been outside the country. Most people just can't afford it. I wish it was more like Europe where you can buy a train ticket and travel through a bunch of countries for like 100 euro. But for Americans, going abroad is a luxury.

2. Some do, but most don't. I think the level of stress and depression for most Americans is pretty high, and it seeps into every aspect of our lives. It's easy to lose our cool over something simple, but most times I feel like people would prefer to joke around and laugh at things than get mad over them.

3. Socially and economically the lower income neighborhoods are places of hopelessness, which breeds apathy, greed, and violence. This is true of all communities of various cultures and races, but I think there are more people in poor black communities that actually embrace the culture of violence and greed as the best way to live their lives.

4. I think this is more true of the internet than in real life. I've visited Western and Eastern Europe, Japan, the UK, and people have asked me about our short-comings and they are surprised when I don't defend our country or our government's actions. Some things are great about America and some are not so great, but that's true of all countries and I think that's where we can find common ground.

5. Are you saying the US *isn't* the greatest country in the world? Seriously though, everyone wants to think that their home is the best. I live near Philadelphia and have to listen to people from Chicago, Dallas, and Boston tell me all the time why their cities and/or states are better. I think Americans have a lot of hometown pride that is unique to our country because every state, and sometimes every city, seems to have its own culture. Also, I think it'd be hard to prove any one country can be the best in the world.

6. Yes, and it's for sale to the highest bidder. For many people in my generation (I'm 33), I think it will just be that - a dream, and it will get worse for the next few generations. I honestly believe I'll never be able to retire, will never be able to pay off the mortgage on my home, and will have to struggle my entire life. My parents had it tough but eventually overcame, as did their parents. But things are so bad economically now, that I sometimes wish things would collapse just to bring us all down to the same level for once.

Don't want to contaminate *my* answers.  If background helps you understand my answers, I am a 4th-year college student in Oklahoma, majoring in physics.  Certainly the people I hang out with are a tightly-selected crowd, but, I think my answers would be as legitimate as any one other American's.

**Answer 1.**  *Why don't you guys travel?* We do, it's just that most of us do it here.  Remember that the Lower 48 is roughly the geographical size of, well, Europe.  Just this summer I took two trips and put about 5000 miles total on my car from them.  I don't commute, so, almost all of those miles are from the vacations.  It does blow my mind that people can be happy commuting and wasting 2 hours *every day* in their cars on the same old highways.

So that said, we do travel, but travelling internationally is *expensive*.  First off, because it's international, there's not so many excuses to go - there are plenty of conferences and attractions in the US, and, most people anywhere aren't likely to apply to foreign universities or jobs.  Second, passports are expensive (they're at $180 now right?) and international airfare isn't cheap either.  I have gone abroad but I just let my passport expire.

**Question 2.** *Why are Americans so serious?*  Some others are probably going to deny this, but yeah, I would say that we are a pretty serious nation.  There are lots of people who are at least moderately religious, so, you can't joke about God.  There's also a lot of people, whom I know at least, who have a pretty Puritan work ethic.  It's not even a ""well one day I'll get my piece of the pie if I keep working hard"" thing - people just believe that working hard is a Good Thing.  I don't claim to know where that comes from, or really if it's different than other countries.

**Question 3** *Why are there so many black people in jail?*  We have come a *long* fucking way, but remember that for the majority of black people in the US, as short as 50 years ago, their parents and grandparents weren't legally allowed to vote, eat with white people, go to the best schools, get certain jobs, and so on.  Pockets of *wildly* discriminatory America still exist today, and I don't just mean lone skinheads, but, realtors who won't sell to minorities; city schools which are as segregated as they were fifty years ago due to white flight; racist cops... it's all at least technically illegal now but there have always been people who the law doesn't do much to stop.  I don't want to paint the picture that all of America is racist, because it's absolutely not, but if 1 out of 50 people who *you* met treated you like shit, you'd be worse off too.

**Answer 4.** *Why do Americans try to put on being uber-patriotic to outsiders?*  For every legitimate expression of patriotism I hear, I also hear another five tongue-in-cheek ones.  As to the serious expressions, I think it's just simple psychology - they are trying to defend what makes them different from you.  I wouldn't read anything in to it.  I would say that most of us understand, at least dimly, that plenty of other countries have better healthcare, or education, or economies, but if we still think the US is better it's because they're not better enough or that our priorities are just different.  As an example, lots of European countries ban hate speech, and thus Germans and French don't have to put up with neo-Nazis doing pathetic rallies down the street.  I would *much* rather prioritize freedom of speech, even though in this instance it just enables people to loudly be stupid and threaten everyone else.

**Question 5** *Why is elitism frowned upon, but USA #1?* Elitism is frowned upon, but if there's the perception that you worked to get where you are, there's a lot of leeway.

**Question 6** *Does the 'American Dream' still exist?* This is pretty much every American novel, film, song, or debate.  At the risk of being exceptionalist, I would say yes, but careful not to think that ""Everybody getting a suburban house and 2 cars and 2.4 kids"" is *the* American Dream.  In the sense that many of the present generation are still growing up with big dreams, and also some of the ambition needed to pull them off, a firm yes.  Also there's still millions of immigrants, and my own communities even are visibly different ethnically than they were when I was very young.  I think that flux is a huge part of ""America"" if you will.

*by Alison Weir*, September 01, 2011

Israel’s Jerusalem Post newspaper recently published an article calling Israel “The New Golden Country” for young people from around the world. It reports that Israel boasts an ever-increasing GDP, a strong currency, and “a lower unemployment rate than the U.S.”

The article fails to mention the well over $3 billion a year that American taxpayers have given Israel for years, nor the fact that some of this money has been used to develop industries that compete with U.S. companies, costing thousands of American jobs and adding to the American unemployment rate.

The story also omits the fact that Israel has periodically stolen U.S. technology, hurting the U.S. economy still more, and fails to note that support for Israel has cost Americans in the range of $3-$6 trillion and that these costs continue to escalate.

The article reports that many young Jewish American singles “are realizing that their future is in Israel. Since 2002, over 7,000 students and young professionals have made aliyah from North America and the UK … bringing with them their skills.”

Many of these new Israeli citizens, the article reports, then “telecommute to their home countries, commute to Europe, or consult globally,” adding to Israel’s economy.

The Israeli story states: “Many students and young professionals are drawn by the incentive of free tuition for a bachelor’s or master’s degree,” comparing this to the United States, where obtaining a degree can put many into significant debt.

According to the article, “Israel sits, quite literally, at the nexus of the world.” The newspaper reports: “This tiny nation is not only in the geographical heart of the globe and at the center of international attention. Israel is also at the very core of innovation, a leader in global commerce and technology.”

Again, the story fails to report the U.S. subsidy of such “innovation.”

In the past 10 years alone, Americans have given Israel the equivalent of approximately $200,000 per Israeli family of five. In addition, there have been weapons subsidies, loan forgiveness programs, special trade preferences, and other generous gifts from American taxpayers to Israel. In fact, despite being one of the world’ smallest nations, Israel receives more U.S. tax money than any other country.

On top of this, a multitude of organizations contributing money and assistance to Israel have been given tax-deductible status in the U.S., removing still more money from the American economy. For example, donations to the “Birthright Israel” program that takes Jewish American students on fun-filled holidays to Israel, convincing many to then “ascend” to Israeli citizenship, are deducted from taxes owed to the U.S.

When Americans become Israeli citizens they retain their U.S. citizenship, allowing them to continue to vote in U.S. elections. Such dual citizenship used to be illegal in the U.S., where it was felt that a citizen could have only one primary national loyalty (for example, in a war or other situations where interests diverged between two nations, an individual would have to choose which to support). It was only after Israel became a nation and many Jewish Americans wished citizenship in both countries that a 200-year American tradition was changed.

The Jerusalem Post article also neglected to mention Israel’s attack on a U.S. Navy ship that killed and injured approximately 200 Americans and caused the ship to be scrapped. Despite all evidence to the contrary, Israel termed this a “mistake” and gave the U.S. $6 million “compensation” for a ship valued at $40 million.

While U.S. news media, which are highly Israel-centric in their coverage of the Israel-Palestine conflict and portray Israelis as victims, the Jerusalem Post reports that “a recent Gallup survey on global well-being ranked Israelis seventh in the world in terms of happiness and satisfaction with their lives” (well ahead of the U.S.).

In considerable contrast, the Palestinian Territories, where the population has been living under Israeli occupation for almost 45 years, is listed as the 12th-lowest population in this well-being survey.

Miami Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the extremely pro-Israel head of the House Foreign Affairs Committee who has just introduced yet another bill on Israel’s behalf, has proposed that the U.S. end assistance programs to the Palestinian population, despite considerable poverty among Palestinian families, while continuing the American dole to Israel, even though Israel is listed among the world’s wealthiest nations.

The Jerusalem Post crows, “The back pages of daily newspapers are overflowing with last-minute vacation deals within Israel and abroad, and it is completely normal to find that your friend or coworker has just found a great deal to fly off to Europe for a long weekend.”

Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to suffer a growing economic crisis, numerous Americans have lost jobs and homes, schools are being closed, businesses have gone bankrupt, and many military families are subsisting on food stamps.

An increasing number of Americans are calling for an end to U.S. taxpayer subsidies to Israel. Some go even further, suggesting that it is time to reverse the money flow and demand that Israel begin sending back some of the billions of dollars it has received from American taxpayers over the past 60-plus years.

According to the CIA World Factbook, Israel’s current account balance is 29th in the world; the U.S. comes in at 196th.",True

*it's called mass deportation. It's very very likely for them to die in greater numbers than the Turks.* 

It's called ethnic cleansing and was part of the genocide. Maybe they didnt mean for so many Armenians but they sure didnt care that their policies were resulting in so many deaths. They just wanted the Armenians gone even if it resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths. Genocide. 

*No shit, and we just settled the fact that there was no intent since the Ottoman government was spending money to feed Armenians. This cannot be denied because it is what happened based on all sources, including American diplomats who were NOT on the side of the Turks.* 

Actually no. They were left to starve and to be killed by their Turkish neighbors. 

*I bet you, your parents told you about this story, and you read some blogs about how it all happened, and you never even read anything from anyone that tries to contradict it. This is dogmatic belief, to refuse to see the other sides' arguments.*

I bet your parents told you about this story and you read some Turk propaganda blogs. You never read any unbiased historically sources. This is dogmatic belief, to refuse to see the other sides of an argument.

*This is why when you are talking to me, you have no arguments, other than saying ""no it did happen."" You have no arguments because you are not educated in the subject. You have no arguments because you don't have the facts in your memory or know where to get them.*

This is why when you are talking to me, you have no arguments, other than saying ""no it didnt happen."" You have no arguments because you are not educated on the subject. You have no argument because you dont have the facts in your memory or know where to get them.  

*You hold me responsible because you are taught at a young age by your Armenian parents, through doctrine, that you must believe in the Armenian genocide, and anyone who denies it is RESPONSIBLE for genocide as well. You see me as just as guilty as TALAT PASHA himself, right?*

Actually I am not Armenian. Are you Turkish by any chance? 

*That's because your parents kept brainwashing you with these stories. They may have even told you the same old ""great grandpa who got killed by turks"" story, almost every Armenian family has those stories, and yet they are all alive, how interesting.*

I dont believe my parents ever brought this subject up. However, almost every Armenian family does have a story how a family member was killed by the Turks, because they were. It is similar to how Jews living in Europe during the holocaust have stories about how their family members were killed. Yet the are still alive, how interesting. You not only just disproved the Armenian genocide but your logic just disproved the holocaust. 

*It's in their doctrine. It's in their religion. It's a cult. The armenian cult to convince everyone that genocide happened.*

Being a victim of genocide is traumatic. Sorta like how current Judaism is defined by the holocaust or african americans in the US still remember slavery. 

* It keeps you unhappy knowing that you hate Turks, it makes you unable to form friendships with them.*

I dont hate the turks. Just people who are genocide apologist. 


Just so you know you have lost this argument. Not between you and I, but from a historical perspective. The genocide is well known. Sure Turkey might deny it, along with the other Islamic countries because they dont care about the Christian Armenians. Besides that it is accepted history. Some governments might not officially recognize it because they want Turkey as an ally, but they know what the Ottoman Turks did to the Armenians. You can try and deny it all you want, but educated people know what happened and the acknowledge is becoming more widespread by the day. You are on the losing side of history.

I proceed to explain the points in my own words

&gt;I am amused by how you simply restated what you already said in another form, as if doing so somehow gives it more validity.

No. You specifically requested it.

&gt;ICJ has severely exceeded its authority, abused the due process and rules of evidence, mishandled witnesses, and in general went out of its way in order to arrive to a prefabricated political conclusion. The ruling is corrupt to the core.

You have linked to a legal opinion arguing as much. But, this is just a legal opinion it cannot refute a decision made by a court after the fact.

&gt;Then you bring up the GCIV 1949 Art 49.6, which I already addressed, so it bears repeating. 

No. I did not bring it up at all. It only appears as part of a direct quote of your previous post. I know your position from your initial post, I quoted it in my last post, now you repeat it to me again. I will not repeat my response, I will only say your debating style is beginning to seem more and more like a series of maneuvers and red herrings designed to obfuscate and avoid the points at hand

&gt;All of this you'd know if you actually read the GCIV instead of googling up the opinions that match your prejudices. 

The problem is that what I have provided are not ""opinions"" they are an international court of Justice ruling, two security counsel resolutions, a general assembly resolution, and conclusions of the Foreign affairs counsel of the European Union. Of the two of us, it is you that are providing unsubstantiated opinions, mainly your own, but also one legal opinion by a certain Eli E Hertz, whom I can only hope you are not trying to pass of as an impartial arbiter.

&gt;These two statements of you directly contradict each other

You may say they do, but the two statements I made are facts:- 
1)the accepted definition of statehood comes from the Montevideo Convention of 1933, which spoke of four criteria for statehood: a permanent population; defined territory; government; and the ability to enter into relations with other states 
2)Palestine has already been accepted as a state by 117 nations Do you dispute that either is a statement of fact, and if so on what grounds?

&gt;It has been the opinion of the international community that has requested adjudication in 1919 and the results of this adjudication became treaty law in San Remo in 1922

Yea, so I looked up the conference of San Remo, it was Britain, France Italy and Japan basically cutting up the spoils of WW1. Article 95 states:-
&gt;....the Mandatory will be responsible for putting into effect the declaration originally made on November 2, 1917, by the British Government, and adopted by the other Allied Powers, in favour of the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine 

So yes, it is grounds for the establishment and validity of a Jewish state (which I have not questioned) with the proviso that "" nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine"" which can hardly be said to have been honored. It in no way gives Jews the right to unlimited expansion of their state within what was mandate Palestine. 

&gt;No, it is unable to act because of the fundamental prohibition to intervene in sovereign affairs that were revamped in the Lotus case 

OK so like the same thing that stopped them interfering in Iraq, Libya, Iran (1953), Nicaragua, Serbia etc. seriously? In any case I was referring here to political and diplomatic pressure, such as the resolution condemning settlement vetoed by the US back in February, there are countless other examples.

&gt;And you're wrong about that as well. Only states can become members in UN. Palestine is not a state. Making it a full member in the UN will not make it a state for the same reason that accepting a dog into a herd of sheep won't make the dog a sheep. 

This is just another red herring. my statement was

&gt;For Palestine, full International rights, including access to the international courts can only be conferred by the UN after full membership 

The UN charter explicitly backs this up:- 
&gt;The recognition of a new State or Government is an act that only other States and Governments may grant or withhold. 
&gt;States are admitted to membership in the United Nations by decision of the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council. 

As I stated, the only obstacle is the US veto. Whether you personally accept that they are a state or not is irrelevant. If they pass the security council and the general assembly they are entitled to international rights under the UN.

Having had these discussions with you it has only hardened my opinion that Palestinians have no option but to push ahead for recognition with the international community. It seems you have no intention of accepting a two state solution broadly along 1967 borders. In all likelihood the Israeli involvement in the peace process has been little more than a pretext to cover further expansion of settlements.",True

Frankly, I don't see Israelis rising up en masse and wantonly slaughtering their Palestinian neighbors. The Israeli government is stable enough to withstand the kind of large-scale power transfer that occurred in SA, and I think the fringe-y settlers are roughly comparable to the hard-line Orange Free State Afrikaaner splinter groups that held out after the fall of grand apartheid, but eventually fell into line out of sheer self interest when their movement collapsed. You'll have the same groups in the new Palestine, but they'll be short-lived, because most of the Jews will emigrate to Europe and the U.S.

This isn't the ""best"" option - that would obviously be a negotiated settlement, but I think that's highly unrealistic. The two sides are too implacably far apart in their demands for real peace.

I live in Massachusetts, so Canada is my only option unless I want to spend *hundreds* of dollars flying to Europe, Southern US (and crossing into Mexico), or the Carribean. Thus, I don't have a passport and don't really see the reason.

Keep in mind that the United States is far, far larger than Europe (and continental US is roughly the size of Australia). Going somewhere outside our nation's borders is often more trouble/money than it's worth. I can't afford to spend a few grand flying to Europe and dicking around for a week unless the I win the lottery.

**Answer 2:** Some of us take ourselves very seriously, but some of us can be very relaxed. Personally, I got picked on a lot. I got into a lot of fights and I get self-conscious and annoyed when someone pokes fun at me. I'm very tense compared to a lot of people I know, though.

**Answer 3:** Our nation still has something of a systematic discrimination against minorities. Keep in mind the USA is a country that still tolerates goose-stepping neo-Nazis and their ilk being out in the open with their hate.

**Answer 4:** I might appear abrasive and patriotic on the Internet when it comes to criticism of my country, but only because most of the foreigners (even here on Reddit) seem to look down on me simply because of my nationality. America is not the backwards hellhole a lot of people seem to think it is. I'm not going to lie and say everything here is fantastic because we've got a lot of shit we need to fix, but I really don't enjoy the snobbery a lot of non-Americans I run into seem to display when it comes to talking about Americans. It especially gets annoying because a lot of foreigners seem to think that just because I'm American that I have no right to criticize anybody because my government has made shitty decisions I had no real say in.

Amusingly enough, most of the foreigners I've met in person have been some of the most polite, enjoyable people to be around.

**Answer 5:** I would never claim the USA is the best country in the world. It IS, however, one of the better countries. Even our poor live in luxury compared to a lot of developing nations and I can deeply appreciate that. But anybody who goes around saying America is the best country ever is either a delusional moron who lives in a backwards hick town or is a naïve foreigner who still believes in the American Dream. We've got a long way to go before we can claim that title.

It's much cheaper traveling within the country itself. There are many great natural and artificial landmarks that are just as good as those in Europe.
2. Well, I have never gotten that sentiment from Americans in general. I have never heard America called an irony-free-zone. We might be a bit more uppity and less good-natured and laid back than Europeans. Americans are very... cold and unfriendly IMO. New York especially. It's a working city. The nice people here are all tourists on vacation or teenagers.

Not exactly what I meant. Here are a few examples:

Yesterday I couldn't decide on which set of headphones to buy. I asked the store clerk if he had any recommendations. He told me to try both out (buy them) and return one before 30 days for a full refund. If I even suggested doing that where I'm from in Europe, I'd be laughed out the country. 

My friend bought the most expensive TV walmart had when he was renting an apartment during an internship. He used it for 2 months...and returned it. No questions asked.

I frequently cancel hotel stays the day of arrival and am never charged or haggled (even though these hotels don't let you cancel within 2 days of arrival).

&gt;Your claim about Syria is even more ridiculous. By that standard, we back everyone we're not currently invading. Maybe you missed it, but our relations with Syria have been pretty nasty. We've had economic sanctions on them for years, a travel ban only recently lifted, and it's only in the last two years that we actually have a diplomat to their country again.

We didn't support them persay so much as we liked the devil we knew in Assad better than the unknown alternative.  Assad has always been good for Israeli security.  Our criticism was muted until it became internationally unbearable not to be critical.

The West loves dictatorships in the Arab world because democracy could bring regimes we don't like and would do more than the token opposition Arab regimes have for Israel.  Sure the west would rather the Arab world be full of liberal, peaceful democracies.  They just don't trust that it would.

Mine I guess? I can only really support policies based on my own views. 

&gt;If we were going by the US government's recommendation for the last 50 years, we'd be a bunch of morbidly obese, diabetic, walking heart attacks waiting to happen...oh wait.

Well...possibly. I'm not sure the government ever recommend people eat 6000-7000 calories or 200-300g of refined sugar a day. The main problem with government recommendations traditionally is they are unrealistic - if you follow them to the letter they are not *that* unhealthy in most cases. But I've very little sympathy for anyone who takes nutritional advice from the government anyway. It's a bit like asking the Department of Health for sex tips and then being annoyed when your wife never orgasms. 

&gt;Sorry, but government interference in a market is always a net loss. Even when it seems like they get something right, they absolutely do not.

The government is already intervening in the market though in so many ways it's unfunny. As I said, food prices as they are currently are heavily influenced by the US Federal subsidies and the EU Common Agricultural Policy. Opposing all government intervention in the market is of course a perfectly fine position to take but it's also not likely to end these practices overnight.

Let me put it another way. Lots of countries in Europe have a tax on all products, including food. If there was a suggestion for this tax to be eliminated for vegetables and fresh meats I would support this idea. Would this be government ""meddling""? Well...yes, I suppose it would but since they're already intervening anyway (by taxing everything) it seems perfectly legitimate to hope for a set of interventions which do the least amount of harm (in my opinion). 

Sure, you might say it'd be better if there was no tax on anything but that's not a likely short-term outcome. You might also say well there's no reason to make things worse - we've got all these subsidies / taxes / tarifs but let's not complicate the situation by creating yet more distortions - and I think that's a perfectly legitimate position to take too (and at times I lean this way) but it has the real-world effect of serving the status quo which is often far from ideal.

2. Not really.  There is a very large bit of comedy coming out of here, and there is a sense of humor amongst people with regards to every day life.  Americans are a bit defensive about Europeans trashing their culture, because it's very very commonly done by Europeans, and all of them with a smug self-satisfaction as though they were the first to notice that we have unhealthy fast food places here (etc.)

3.  Depending on whom you ask, it's either because many of them belong to a self-destructive subculture that glorifies crime and ""doing time"", or because we actively seek out and target African Americans for arrest.  Maybe a combination of the two.  Again, depends on who you ask.

4. Again, we get defensive, because it's relentless.  If people visiting your country took every opportunity to spit on it as soon as they saw something that they didn't like or that was different to them, you'd probably get that way too.  Youtube is littered with videos of Europeans visiting the US and criticizing everything that they see.  If, however, one posted a video of an American visiting France and doing the same, one would be flooded with comments about how ignorant and closed-minded that person was.  You don't see other cultures getting as defensive about things, because you don't see nearly as many situations where it would be warranted.

5.  Because there's a weird breed of patriotism here that is largely based upon fear, and because nationalism is very different than class warfare.  Elitism isn't frowned upon by the elite.  It's frowned upon by the non-elite.  So the two notions are pretty consistent.  In either case, it's fear and disdain for outsiders.  (Of course, I would add that the people you are describing are but a segment of our people.  The US is extremely varied in culture, opinion, etc. both by region and by individual.)

6.  The ""American Dream"" exists, but to most of us, it's no longer a dream.  It's an entitlement and something that we are owed by our society and way of life.  It's what we're promised in silent exchange for tolerating the abuses that we tolerate/perpetuate in the third-world, and for the disgusting things that our government does when no one is looking.  When we aren't able to live up to the ever rising standard of living here, we turn to politics and politicians to fix it for us.  They almost always fail.  We don't remember that.

But the snakes are starting to eat eachother. Masses of lawsuits we lodged against the TBTF banks, which has driven down their share prices, and is driving their need to recapitalise. Which will be impossible. When one of them fails, the others take a hit to their CDS holdings. So they need to recapitalise.

But all anyone cares about is their entitelments. What good is a social security cheque if it's minted in a dying currency?

Sorry people, but social security only works in one context. You must raise children to care for you. Anything else is based on the same principle but abstracted through taxes. There must be children to support the elders.

It worked in the war generation becuase there were far more baby boomers than old timers. Today the opposite is true. 

In short, we're fucked. It's every man for himself, and all the politicians are fighting about is the arrangement of the deck chairs.

Take a look around at the society you're in, because odds are, it won't last out the next couple of years without epic failures.

Not only did they us lethal force but many of the wounds were indicative of execution with close range shots to the head even after receiving multiple gunshot wounds.

The UNHRC also stated that there was sufficient evidence to prosecute on grounds of violation of the Geneva convention and violation of international law, in other words the raid was totally unlawful.

I think the majority of people who call Israel an Apartheid state are looking at what is going on in Gaza and the West Bank. If Israel will not permit them to have their own state, and insists on occupying and controlling those territories, then it ought to give those Palestinian residents Israeli citizenship. Why don't they do it? Because they're determined to keep Israel as a Jewish-majority state. That is the only way to keep Israel meeting ""European"" norms of democracy, and controlled by the Jewish portion of the population - so you can see the parallel there with Apartheid South Africa, where Apartheid was basically the White minority's way of keeping themselves in power, and disenfranchising the black majority.

&gt; All citizens of the state have and enjoy the same full rights - there is no denying this.

As of yet, I think this is largely true, and in Israel proper the situation is nowhere near as bad as it was for blacks in Apartheid South Africa. But for how long? Even looking only at Arabs in Israel proper, Israel faces a demographic problem. As the proportion of Arabs-Israelis increases, if they wish to remain a Jewish-controlled state, they will have to resort to Apartheid-like methods to remain in power. So already you are seeing proposals to make Arab Israelis take oaths of loyalty, bans on intermarriage, etc. etc. 

&gt; Know something we don't? Tell the women who can vote and drive, the gays who can serve in the army and marry, the Arabs who bash the government freely while serving in the Parliament and do so without censorship that they don't have the same rights to do these things like all other citizens in Israel

Why not just ask them? Many of them do say that they feel like 2nd class citizens. At the very least, saying that Israel is a Jewish state means what? That it's not really their country - they don't belong there. 

http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/07/world/middleeast/07israel.html

1st of all Gaza is not occupied any longer - it is being blockaded b/c their leadership is at war with neighboring Israel and they are [occasionally being provided weapons via the sea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Affair) - Israel left Gaza completely hoping for actual peace - no preconditions, just up and gone - and they got violence instead...

As it is, people living in the West Bank (Occupied territories) do not fall under the same laws as those in the naton itself... like I've said before in other comments, call the West Bank occupied, make arguments/discuss for/against it - but do not say Israel proper practices Apartheid, that is simply false on all accounts. There may be some discrimination as exists in all countries but there is no legal differentiation between any religion, sex, race or creed within the state itself.

&gt; they're determined to keep Israel as a Jewish-majority state. That is the only way to keep Israel meeting ""European"" norms of democracy, and controlled by the Jewish portion of the population

Would you (do you) have a problem with the UK? because the UK is essentially a theocratic democracy (there's a Christian monarchy). Whatever the population makeup, the UK will consistently remain a Constitutional Monarchy with a democratic Parliamentary system...

As such, there is nothing wrong with a democracy that has *theocratic subtext*, so long as the theocratic nature doesn't win out.... Nations have the right to choose how they are presented in the world; the US has Christmas as a national holiday! What about Hanukkah or Ramadan or Kwanza?

As the cords, like workmen hammering to construct a vast edifice, became louder, in a slow but inexorable buildup of strength and intensity, General Friedrich Ferch(german), Eighteenth Army's Chief-of-Staff, started getting reports that his troops were listening on the radio.

 

The performance was being relayed across the Soviet Union and by short-wave radio to the rest of Europe and the United States. The Germans later banned the symphony from being played in any territory they occupied. But for now, Frech sensed an opportunity. He ordered his long-range artillery to zero in on the Philharmonic.

 

But Govorov had anticipated im. The siege of leningrad was very much an artillery battle and the Germans knew the whereabouts of any significant buildings in the city. Their bombardment timetable had always targeted people who might be going to the theatre. However, the Russians had always been very good gunners, and Govorov, a specialist in counter-battery fire- silencing the enemy's artillery with your own- knew where the German batteries were.

 

As the majestic symphony played on, a massive and precisely targeted Russian artillery strike paralyzed the German guns. there is no doubt about this. Ferch ordered the initial German strike, but all the witnesses - and the elite of Leningrad were all there- confirm that no German shells landed anywhere near the concert hall. As the entire orchestra in the Philharmonic joined in, building the volume of the symphony, other parts of a wider 'orchestra', Leningrad's guns, joined in too.

 

Land-based artillery and the grey Baltic fleet battleships, their fire superbly directed, belched shells at the German positions. The moral and physical components of a nation's soul and fighting power fused in harmony, and the German guns were silenced. The words of Aleksandr Tvardovskiy's poem come to mind: ""nashi byut, teper' kayuk""- 'those are OURS firing. Now it's curtains...'.

 

Not quite. It would be another eighteen months before the curtains finally closed on the siege.

For me; Black Ops has to be the most disappointing Call of Duty game I've ever played. The sound engine is garbage. I can barely hear footsteps like I can in MW2 or COD 4. In Black Ops, footsteps sound like the pitter patter of tiny feet. Before they patched it, you could barely hear anything other than environmental sounds. Hell, gunfire sounded as if it was 5 miles away, even when it was literally just around the corner. The network issues are the worst. Hit detection is horrific. You get told you're on 4 bars, even when you're lagging. I remember having one game where I was 2 seconds behind everyone, even though I was the host. I can fire at someone without getting a hitmarker; only for him to turn around and seemingly insta-kill me. I've played on hosts that were on the west coast of the US (I'm from Europe) and MW2 still managed to find a way to keep me somewhat competitive. Another thing is the pace of Black Ops. It feels slower and my character figure feels as if he's walking in quicksand sometimes. Playing FFA is like looking for Anne Frank, as everyone likes to sit in their respective spots with Ghost and silenced Famas.

That's just another way of saying, ""I'm going to do whatever I feel is best, regardless of the evidence"". 

Also, I find it interesting to talk to gun owners about gun crime and gun accidents, because it brings out contradictory arguments. On the one hand, they argue that gun accidents are common only because of irresponsible use. Then they say that we shouldn't require licensing of gun owners and registration of guns, because that would make it difficult to obtain guns for home protection.

I'm not for banning all firearms, but I think that some weapons and accessories (the kind covered by Clinton's assault weapons ban, extended magazines, etc.) shouldn't be legal because they're almost never used for home protection and can be extremely lethal in the hands of a robber or mass murderer.

I also think that gun owners should be licensed and firearms registered because of the kinds of behaviors you describe. I don't think that would lead to tyrannical government taking over, for a couple of reasons:

1) The citizenry is already massively outgunned by the military in the U.S.  And as we saw in Iraq, IEDs are a much more effective means of fighting the American military than rifles and handguns.

2) Japan, Canada, and the nations of West Europe have had gun control for many years. They're still very democratic.

3) A lot of dictators manage to maintain power despite having very liberal firearms laws. The examples that come immediately to mind are Hussein's Iraq, Taliban-led Afghanistan, and present day Syria.",True

Neither is the nuke debate, and both are much more complicated problems than you're really admitting to here.

You can spin this as ""LOL America, your government is corrupt and ours isn't,"" but it's not shocking that the U.S. and Belgium don't necessarily have the same perspective on world events, and I think it'd be more honest to at least try to *consider* America's point of view for a moment. There's a legitimate moral question about the degree to which [European members allow NATO to subsidize their own defense budgets](http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htlead/20110615.aspx) while contributing a dwindling number/amount of troops, training, and resources, and that observation has been made by a number of European commenters as well.

Let's take Afghanistan, the issue under discussion here. Belgium contributes [the use of 521 troops to NATO in Afghanistan](http://www.isaf.nato.int/troop-numbers-and-contributions/belgium/index.php), one person to the training of the Afghan National Army, nothing to the training of the Afghan national police force, nothing to Provincial Reconstruction, and nothing to equipment donation, school/civic resource construction, or relief funds for Afghan locals. And the Belgian troops who *are* there are so hamstrung by politically-motivated rules of engagement that it's difficult for them to properly support other NATO troops. This is a complaint being made by many European contingents in Afghanistan, who are familiar with conditions on the ground and irritated by their home politicians' queasiness over the idea of anyone's arrival home in a body bag. You can't fight a war if the military's primary responsibility lies in saving some politician's career, and not the actual objectives in the field.

Viewed in this light, Belgium's actual contribution to NATO's efforts in Afghanistan is rather problematic. Belgium gets the privilege of saying it's doing its part while it functionally does very little -- and it's not the only NATO member in this position. I don't think it's surprising that the United States is ""frustrated"" with the current state of affairs, because NATO is rapidly becoming a latter-day example of the tragedy of the commons. ",True

In contrast, Spanish-speakers see the moon as being more like a woman, because in Spanish the word for moon is grammatically feminine (“la Luna”).

As I have come to understand it, it is deeply rooted in the European culture that the moon is female and the sun is male, just like silver/quicksilver is female and sulphur is male. This also shows in alchemy/certain ancient philosophies and finding the philosopher's stone. That the germans see the moon as male, is just one tiny thing that shows that they hold a rather special position in Europe. 

The key to creating the philosopher's stone - again: as I have come to understand it - is to find a formula to combine two things from the opposite side of the spectrum with something on the other side - mostly quicksilver (representing the moon, the female) and sulphur (the sun, male) and then you can change things from one end of the spectrum in the other, like for example changing lead into gold. But that is just one of the possibilities.   

You could change a man in a woman, change an old person in a young one etc. I have come to understand that this is a theme in the book 'Orlando', by Virginia Woolf, where a woman changes into a man and continues to live forever.

Basically, the world was confusing, so people made a bunch of arbitrary assertions that made it simpler to evaluate and act. Some of those are things like religion and political borders that most redditors recognize as arbitrary BS. But, they also said that people are individuals with a free will that transcends outside influences, which most people still agree with. Post-structuralists say that this core assumption really has no basis in the real world. That we're exceedingly the product of normalization by ""society"", where society is everything from media to schooling. Look deeper and you see that the agenda-setting done by things like media and school is generally done by a relatively small group of individuals, which means society is drawn towards their ideas of normal. These people are said to have ""biopower"". But of course, those people aren't transcendent of their upbringing either, so it's really like a totally inert object pulling things their way by weight.

Relevant to post-structuralism is the switch from top-to-bottom to bottom-to-top individuality. In Rome and Feudal Europe, the individuals were those in charge. You could be raised to the importance of an individual by the Emperor or the King, but you were usually an addendum to him. Most people weren't thought of as ""individuals"" but as members of a mob. Everyone knew everything about their leader. Whereas today, the masses are the ones who fill out censuses, we advertise ourselves on social media, our banks and local politicians know everything about us- but we know very little about the elite who tend to escape to their wealth-islands. 

That's significant to the Biopower thing because the ""myth"" of free will prevents people from feeling like part of the same pleb group. It's a sort of social-level divide and conquer tactic by the powerful. 

So here's what you have with a rapid-fire, high communication world, with the agenda setting in the hands of very few, and the people being easiliy influenced: very rapid normalization. Meaning, everyone becomes more alike. It's the social side of globalization, a term you're probably familiar with that shows how faster shipping, communications and general technology sharing essentially makes the world ""smaller"" because more people have more and more access to each other, each other's goods, and each other's technology.

And that's the platform post-modernist political thinkers come from, and their ideas for governance (or lack thereof in many cases) accept that as the reality from which one should build a society, rather than the modernist, individualism/nationalistic platform.

Sort of. Yeah. You could never actually explain post-structuralism to a 5 year old.",True

Another was Polish, parents came to America shortly before WWII. Also changed their names, and converted religion, and lied to their children about their history in order to assimilate. My grandmother only learned in her 60s that her family was once Jewish and again, can only guess about heritage.

To be brief, the issue is that Europeans came to Palestine and destroyed over 500 villages and removed the population from the land, and then declared their ""right to exist"" on the ashes of the people they massacred.

If you want peace it start through a recognition that all stolen land will be returned, and reparations paid. War crimes need to be addressed as well. Refugee's need to be able to come back to Palestine and too their homes(most of which must be rebuilt).

For example: Here is the story of Yalu. Yalu was a village that was massacred and annexed to Israel in 1967 and they turned it into a Park rather than give it back to the Palestinians. This is one of the horrible ways they expel the people from their land. They call it Canada Park.

First, that you find something offensive is not an argument against it's veracity.

&gt; Health care would be a positive right, because you would owe it to someone else. Someone else has to give it to you.

No, as I stated. It could be asserted that you are obliged to refrain from preventing a person from leading a healthy life. The right to life obliges you to refrain from taking action. That's the definition of a negative right. An obligation to refrain from action.

If I pluck an orange from a tree on your property to keep from starving and you walk across your property and shoot me for it, you have taken an action. 

You bring an extreme example, the case of someone taking all of your property for a few seconds of life, and claim it is absurd. However, that is no more absurd than the situation where you own all the food and water in the world and claim the positive right (""you are permitted to"") to enact violence or even murder in order prevent me from plucking a single orange from one of your many trees.

The fact is, what we have in both situations is a moral dilemma where two rights are in conflict. And like with all moral conflicts, they must be resolved through an evaluation of relative harms. 

It also demonstrates why a rationalist system of morals which assumes a single right takes absolute precedence over all others in all situations is inherently flawed. In your case, you assume the right to property takes precedence over all other rights and for the sake of argument I upheld the proposition that the right to life was preeminent. 

Finally, please consider that under your system of morals a feudal society of free peasants is a perfectly moral society. And, in fact, the very reason such societal structures are immoral is the extreme situation I describe above where one man owns all property. Just as the very reason that Communism is deemed immoral is your extreme example of one man being stripped of all his wealth. 

Social Democracies based on free market economy, the bar for modern just societies like the United States, Europe, etc., are the attempt to find a medium between these two morally untenable extremes.",True

• Our ""idols"" or pop culture celebs are getting younger and younger. I'm aware that the same thing is happening with the US (ex Disney channel) but they like to dress up and put make-up on young girls to make them look older. Here, elementary school age kids are seen in school uniform-like costumes, with no make-up on and generally going for the ""innocent virgin"" look. There is a really popular singing girls group here called AKB48 and all the girls wear high/middle school uniforms. And some of these girls are in their early twenties. 

• There are ""boy idols"" here far, far worse than Justin Bieber. Men in their thirties wearing skin-revealing, extravagant, bright-colored clothes singing cheesy pop crap. In groups. To me this is very, very disturbing. 

• Not to mention our highly innovative fashion section (cosplay, goth-Loli, harakuku style, ""gal""s - all of these are old but you can find people like them still on our streets). They're not WTF in a bad way though, just different. 

Finally, in my opinion Japanese girls spend too much time and money fussing over how they look. They spend an average $100 on their hair once a month, another $300 on their nails every couple of months, and wear too much make-up. People go to hair salons for the sole purpose of  getting their bangs cut. False eye-lashes and contact lenses to make your pupils look bigger have been the latest craze, and every girl on the street now looks like a gigantic-eyed anime girl straight off the mangas.

So Yes everyday investors would rather lend to the German government at below inflation rates than lend to Italy and get a 5% rate. Why? Because they know they will get their money back from Germany.

Are you sure those are the same investors?

&gt; Would investors prefer Eurobonds? Sure. But how is it going to happen? Germany and the northern states will not write a blank cheque for southern spending, they've said as much, repeatedly. Your solution is dependant on them doing just that and there is no political will for it and certainly not in the time frames required.

The limited bonds solution *hinges* on the fact that the percentage of GDP they can be used to cover is low enough not to risk a default.  Additional debt will come at a higher price than the same debt now once that thing'd be in place, the market will see to that. What Europe needs to get off off is accumulating debt and by now, *every* state has got the message that it'd better repay. Berlusconi not getting it doesn't mean Italy doesn't grok it. Germans will start to have higher wages (yay!) not to suck the other states dry (yes, we've been utter bastards by dumping wages -- even with union participation). Trust me, the unions are working on reversing that; not everything is state politics; and even if the SPD isn't in power the social democrats still are in power.

A two-speed Euro is an even more unviable option than bonds, because it's going against *everything* the EU is actually trying to achieve... not to mention that the politics required to decide who is in which camp are way more intractable than laying down sufficiently common fiscal politics, that is, the EU fiscal ""government"" option. Which, in any case, is in every way preferable to having the IMF have a say.

&gt; In the meantime europe is in recession and the clock is ticking.

Slightly off-topic, but relying on growth is pure hubris. Ever had a look at an exponential curve?

They probably wanted Turkey to do something completely different, and Turkey wanted them to declare PKK as a terrorist organization (win-win). Same thing going on with the Armenian Genocide. Armenian lobby wants US to declare that Turkey did the things they claim. But Obama denies it (I know Obama doesn't have that authority to declare whether Turkey committed those crimes, but he pressures the senate), simply because they need Turkey in the region. Funny thing is, before Obama was elected, he promised that he'll do everything he can do make the senate accept these charges against Turkey. Politics.

I do have this fear. We're not as a Muslim country as Iran, but I honestly believe that AK Party's secret agenda is to make Turkey more like Iran. The negotiations between EU and Turkey is on hold. Turkish media don't even make any news about EU anymore. We started full-membership negotiations at the same time with Croatia and I believe they'll be in the Union next year. According to the analysts, we have more than 10-15 years to be in the Union. And in my opinion, it's never gonna happen when AK Party is the ruling party. The worst part is, the people don't want to be in EU either. I don't know the country I'm living in for the past decade. And it really sucks. I'm studying in another country and when I graduate, I'd probably have tons of options to choose from. I can live in any other country, but my family nor my friends don't have that privilege.

That as long as we HAVE a military we should have conscription as it acts as a ""safety valve"" towards politicians who may want to use the military for some unsavoury things.

Well, it's cute that you can't conceive of having a military without conscription, but that only shows that you should start learning something about the world beyond the German border. Arguing that conscription is neccessary because a military is neccessary is an obvious non sequitur.

&gt;It also gets around this messy little thing of the German constitution that prohibits the Government from deploying troops outside of German territory or within a defence situation within NATO.

The legality of German military operations has nothing to do with whether they're performed by conscripts or professional soldiers. Nothing at all. You either know nothing about this or you're deliberately lying.   
Hoping for mutiny is not the way to go about preventing illegal wars in any case.

&gt;If anything this proves my point that a full conscript army is less likely to go visit other countries ""on a mission"" than an all volunteer army.

That just proves my point that an all conscript army is just a giant waste of money. Going on missions is pretty much the only thing the army has to do. If it can't do that we might as well stop pissing away billions of dol

Well, you were wrong. Please don't try to argue that most Germans hold the opinion, that you can just force people into useless labor and education camps 'for their own good' for years at a time with no justification but general paranoia about all politicians.

Instead, very quickly experiment with a bunch of visual changes in r/gameup, internally debate the best schedule changes in terms of how often we play games and at what time, and then roll it all in one big announcement with the caveat that this is all subject to change depending on how well it works.

That depends on the percentage of GDP the bonds would cover. I certainly very much doubt it'd be more than 70%, probably less. It's about wiggle room, not a carte blanche to accumulate debt on the community's shoulders.

More importantly, though, it gets national interest in their own banks more or less out of the way, like France coercing Germany into saving Greece just to save French banks. The risk could be shared in an actually controlled, and thus way less risky, way.

A ""Europe of two speeds"" is in some way needed, yes, but not in the north growing more than the south... but in the south growing more than the north to alleviate the imbalance.
