&gt;You say ""our culture"" but what culture are you referring to? I'm Irish living in London and I've found cultural differences even us close neighbours with the same language and a lot of the same entertainment media. 

   Ah yes, I find I have a bad tendency to confuse capitalist culture with actual culture.  That is to say, I have a false notion of us all living in a somewhat shared culture of imposed idols such as actors, athletes and politicians, advertising culture, consumer culture. 
   Whereas culture can and often is something foreign of these things.  
Im an english Canadian living in Vancouver, So although I see a lot of different culture on the outside, I don't necessarily participate in it, that is a lot of varied Asian cultures, Indian and Pakistani, some Middle Eastern and less so European immigration and African. 
  We have a good deal of sub culture that I have somewhat participated in - drug culture, music culture, art and so forth, unique to Vancouver. Of course internet culture as well is a new sort of frontier. 

&gt;If this is true, then are you saying it was ever different to this? Or wasn't it always that there are crowds of people who prefer the minority do a lot of the learning &amp; exploration and they will happily fund and follow?

Im saying it's not possible for me to know if it was ever different, So Ill suppose it was probably always this way. 
   There is a subtle point ive infused without clarifying. That is that knowledge was always considered very dangerous, perhaps the bourgeois to a lesser extent but more fundamentally the church viewed knowledge as something that must not fall into the hands of the common people - the very same with fascism and the rise of propaganda, that if the 'common people' or the 'proles', Us, ever gained access to the vastness that is human knowledge we would realize our equality and revolutionize the world. And so far things remain fundamentally the same, the same power structure, the same exploitation. 
   So its not so much that the crowd allowed the few to control them, they were goaded into it through psychological manipulation, through fear of god or force of arms. 

&gt; By the way, it's modern people or modern humanity but it hasn't been modern man in ages.

I stand corrected.

&gt; In any case, this is a classic rhetorical question with no answer at all.

True, only used the Greece reference as one of the foundations of the idea of the Republic and freedom of thought, the birthplace of western philosophy. Trying to appeal to your emotions ;P

&gt;Although you may be right about the education system, I don't believe you are right in thinking that this represents our willingness to learn. People may not always want to know ""the truth"" but I find that people do want to continue to learn, particularly those who are prevented from it.

Yes it seems that when something is is forbidden it is sweeter, I touched on this in the paragraph above and I want to tie my reply into some other things you said ...

&gt; I hear classical music because that's the station I choose.
&gt; I avoid ads but I agree that there are way too many ads. However, there are movements against these and places where there are no ads.
&gt; And then there's freedom, which you define in terms of politics alone.
&gt; Freedom is being able to move - mentally, physically and emotionally. A person in a jail cell can have a free mind.

Indeed freedom is all about choice, and I reconcile freedom with government because it seems to be lagging behind, because of the nature of the human race and this notion being discussed about - to put this bluntly and arrogantly - quite stupid, and happy that way.

  Now, usually I don't defend myself because offended people are much more honest, but I respect you so in the spirit of life in its true form, that is dancing, polarity, resonance, ill tell you that I know im not in the clouds with some men, Eg. Nietzche or more modern Zizek, nor artistically like Poe, Shakespeare ect ect. Ill (probably  [probably only because im not the same man I was yesterday, it would really be arrogant to assume I knew a man ive never met, my future self]) never be a great philosopher or thinker, but ill do my damned best.
  I see myself as what the bare minimum should be for intellect in our society, and its disheartening to see such a lack of enthusiasm from those I encounter everyday. 

  It seems government lags behind because of this - that if 51% of people don't give a damn if their system is corrupt it screws it up for the rest of us, this is how society, government, and culture become stirred together. So while we do have the limited freedom of personal choice, we are powerless in this system to create any real change, save some catalyzing hero to stimulate the masses. 
 
I deny only that this is pessimistic, for I see it as accurate. Narrow mindedness has always been a fault of mine. 

Might I bother you for your thoughts on this notion ?

I think TTR, TaT and TA are definitely different enough to be worth trying (and perhaps ordering). TaT is somewhat similar to TTR, but far from the same game. TA is completely different. That's why I own all three (well technically I own [TransEuropa](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/16267/transeuropa) and [Ticket to Ride Europe](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/14996/ticket-to-ride-europe) but they're very similar to their American counterparts). Are you from the US ? [Thoughthammer](http://www.thoughthammer.com/) should have the lowest US prices hands down, if there's anything you're looking to buy.

For light and fun I forgot to mention [Niagara](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/13308/niagara). Nice production value, uses the box as part of the game board setup. Check out some BGG pics to see what I mean: [1](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/119037/niagara), [2](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/60326/niagara), [3](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/60325/niagara).

PitchCar is expensive, large, heavy and a ton of fun. This may work for beer and pizza night ... but be wary of the amount of alcohol consumed. You're flicking wooden disks around. Size is definitely an issue. Also, with the components of the base game you can't really make cool/complicated tracks, so you need at least some the expansions ([1](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1526/pitchcar-extension) [2](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/25946/pitchcar-extension-2) [3](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38677/pitchcar-stunt-race) [4](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/25948/pitchcar-special-long-straights)). There is a smaller version called [PitchCar Mini](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/14254/pitchcar-mini) but I wouldn't recommend it. The discs are much smaller, they don't have the same feel, it gets too crowded with 3+ players, etc.
Wasabi! has a high production value. It actually comes with real small soy sauce containers, and looks very nice. I find it to be an average game though, so I wouldn't recommend purchasing it.

If you look at it from an RTS perspective, I don't know how much you'd enjoy Manoeuvre or Corps Command (or any other wargame for that matter). They definitely resemble the TBS genre a lot more. I can't think of a fully real-time boardgame, but I know a couple exist with real time elements.

You're asking me for a strategy game, but I don't know if you mean strictly wargame, or abstract strategy as well (Go, Blokus, [Ingenious](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9674/ingenious), [Dvonn](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2346/dvonn), [Yinsh](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/7854/yinsh), [Zertz](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/528/zertz), [Hive](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2655/hive)).

For abstract strategy, I find both Hive and Ingenious to be great. Hive is 2p only, Ingenious is 2-4. Ingenious also takes 2v2 (teams), which is quite a bit of fun as well.

For wargames, I'm currently very much into [CC:E](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/21050/combat-commander-europe) - a card-driven hex-and-counter wargame. It has a sort of real time element that you may like - when the opponent moves using a particular type of card (2 types of cards allow movement, and you can only react to one of them), you may shoot at him. That's as far as it goes for both players doing something at the same time. Be wary though, the rulebook is long. You will fumble through it for your first few plays. Without prior wargame experience you may find it daunting.

Another one would be [CoH](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/24800/conflict-of-heroes-awakening-the-bear-russia-194). I haven't actually played this one, but I know it has a similar real time element. Both players have 7 or 8 special action points, which may be used during the opponent's turn to interrupt it and do something. I think that something is limited to shooting, and once the points are gone they don't replenish.

What would a serious gamer play ... I'm not sure. The group I meet up with plays almost anything (some exceptions: SoC, Monopoly, Risk, Munchkin and anything else Steve Jackson, to name just a few). A lot of the [top ranked games on BGG](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame) get tabled. There's also a guy who buys almost every new game that looks interesting - they usually get tabled for a few weeks from release then put in the ""trade"" pile.

As for myself, my preferences always tends to change. Currently, I'd always play [Agricola](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260/agricola), [Goa](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9216/goa) or the above mentioned CC:E. Yes, the theme of Agricola is farming, but that doesn't bother me one bit. Agricola has been at the top of my list for a while, CC:E and Goa joined somewhat recently. On a side note, I'm currently a lot more focused on CCGs than boardgames. Magic is eating up a lot of my time, even though I'm playing strictly casual.

It would be equal to have 210 spots for everyone if Maori were equally represented socio-economically, as well as educationally (ie: poor results in high school etc). Whilst its easy to argue that Maori students should just ""do better"", its not always that easy. The effect of poverty, or being poor in a relative sense, makes it very hard to achieve well scholastically. For example, if your parents are poor you will live in a poor neighborhood and attend a poorer school. Chances are you wont do as well as someone who is living in a very affluent area and has books, stationary, tuition etc all provided for them. You dont get to go to uni because your family cannot afford it (or you dont have the results), so you use your high school education, if you even have one, to get a poor paying job. Have kids, cycle repeats itself. 

By introducing the ability to provide free tuition or extra spots to students who make a real effort and come from a less than privileged background, the governments aim with this policy is to try and break that cycle. It may not be perfect, and relies heavily upon the individual to make the right choices and such; but its better than nothing.

&gt; Treating people differently based upon their genetic ancestry is wrong, no matter how benevolent the intentions behind the policy.

The problem was, this is exactly what happened previously. Look up the policies of assimilation and integration adopted by the European government. 

The major issue people dont seem to get it that Maori are not guaranteed a spot in the course. They still have to have the required academic results too. It is simply designed to allow additional students into the course who historically do not often get into these courses. Its designed to help alleviate the disparity between Maori and Pakeha incomes/living conditions (for lack of a better term) etc. 

Its fine to argue for equality, but be sure to remember how European settlers treated the Maori, as well as the subsequent government policies imposed, and ask yourself if that could have any future consequences. 

If we want to go to extremes, Pakeha are now the victims of racism. Just be glad you're not being shot, or given diseases, or having your land taken. :)

&gt; You don't see any benefits to our recognizing that we are all human beings riding the same rock through space? 

I hail from *a people* that produced this (many centuries ago) as one of their *cultural expressions*:

بنی آدم اعضای یک پیکرند
که در آفرينش ز یک گوهرند
چو عضوى به درد آورد روزگار
دگر عضوها را نماند قرار
تو کز محنت دیگران بی غمی
نشاید که نامت نهند آدمی

Sons of Adam are members of one body
And their creation from one jewel
And when one member is pained
There is no peace for the others.
If you are not empathic to the pain of others
it is not permissible to call you Adamic (Human).


As a matter of fact I recognize that we are all human beings and each of the groups in *the human family* have the right to self determination and their own culture, and societal order.  I love Chinese culture and would like to see what the Chinese come with in the next 1000 years; same with the Persian; same with the Europeans. 

&gt; You find the petty squabbling between states amusing perhaps?

I find nothing ""amusing"" in war, and find even less to amuse myself when considering the *fact* that I live on a ""rock"" wherein the likely institutions and ""leaders"" of the ""inevitable"" one world (police) state are [lying murderous prostitutes](http://writtenbyhim.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/tony_blair_is_a_wanker.jpg) who show no restraint in their ceaseless acts of (""amusing"") aggression against fellow ""rock"" dwellers who do not wish to sign up for the distopian inevitable global state.

&gt; Or maybe you just like the fact that we (assuming you are from what is referred to as the western world) are on top?

No.  The up and down of civilizations is healthy overall.  Up today, down tomorrow.  (Repeat).  Results?  Glorious expression and flowering of *diverse* Human culture.  Its worked for the past few thousands years.  (As opposed to the ""inevitable"" distopia which even looks shaky on paper ...)

&gt; You don't feel the least bit frustrated with the fact that the lions share of the worlds resources are used to build weapons of destruction to use on our fellow human beings?

It doesn't matter what has gone before, the sons are not responsible for the sins of the father. Suggesting that any current policy be based upon the actions of the long past just seems an ingenious method of discrimination.

You seem to enjoy talking about in generalities. Rather than citing specific examples where I'm 'clearly' in the wrong, you just assert that you're the expert, and that I'm wrong.

I personally know people who are going to be emigrating from, and who have immigrated to the USA. I'd done digging regarding laws of Canada and a few misc European countries. There are a multitude of hoops to be jumped through - and often you are not going to be getting into countries without being skilled in a specific field they are lacking. Not to mention, if this country is a non-english speaking country, it's just going to be that much more difficult to find employment.

If you *read* my posts, you'll notice I never once said 'THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE' - I said it was going to be very, very difficult. What you seem to be ignoring is the part where the guys has kids, and the emotional connection to friends, family and life in general here. I still hold that it won't be a cakewalk to jump through all the hoops you need to emigrate - but on top of that you have to factor in how it will impact children, extended family, etc etc. This is _much_ simpler when you are single or at least without children. I am not sure of your situation, but I'd be willing to lay odds that you don't have kids.

At the time I was convicted, the US wasn't particularly liked around here. After 9/11 and the Bush era, it was even worse. I remember once when a bar fight started just because a guy was American. In the recent months it did change a lot however.

This is nonsense because most people don't know anything about the ""Bible"" anyway. People would get far more out of a good history or art book written by scholars who may *reference* the ""Bible"" (a story or 2 perhaps at the most).

Any deep, nuanced understanding (if that's possible on the subject) is the bullshit of scholars and is not really all that helpful.

The same goes here.

Who really cares if Shakespeare coined some oft-used English phrases. It's interesting, but doesn't really matter.

&gt; So I am interested in finding out what it's like living in a country with a dangerously high crime rate where murders/shootings/robberies are a common place occurrence.

Crime rate varies drastically by locality.  Overall crime rate may be fearsome, but this distills down to vast regions of extremely safe areas punctuated by the occasional terrifying (usually urban) neighborhood.

I life in Portland, OR, and I never fear for my life.  Well, usually never.  About the closest I get towards fearing for it is the odd bad driver.

&gt; Is this why America is a car heavy culture unlike every other developed country, so that people can commute in (relative) safety?

Canada's pretty car heavy too, you know, compared to Europe.  It's not about safety, it's about access to vast resources during the latter half of the 20th century yielding urban areas that were built specifically for the automobile.

Yes.  All the time.  It's warmer here, so more than Canada, usually.

Obviously, the major downside of such a policy is that it does mean you'll get social problems as if you are only letting well qualified immigrants in, they are going to get better jobs than the poorly educated groups in already present in society, which will crank up inter-community tensions, but compared with letting two generations die in poverty due to lack of tax incomes, it's the better of the two choices",False,8,,False,CraigTorso,True,1265021607,0,8,t5_2qh13,t1_c0jrxh7,c0jryhe,worldnews,0

True, but if someone was drunk they too wouldn't exactly be a reliable source (as you said). So in no circumstances would anybody be following your logic.

&gt;I'm sorry, but scientific testing has never demonstrated any effect in humans other than a subjective ""feeling""

.

&gt;A study in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol[78] concluded that a high concentration of thujone in alcohol has negative effects on attention performance. It slowed down reaction time, and caused subjects to concentrate their attention in the central field of vision. Medium doses did not produce an effect noticeably different from plain alcohol. The high dose of thujone used in the study was larger than what can currently be obtained, even in claimed ""high thujone"" absinthe that cannot be sold legally in the European Union. While the effects of this high dose were statistically significant in a double blind test, the test subjects themselves were unable to reliably identify which samples were the ones containing thujone.

But it's from wikipedia and the source gives a 404. 

&gt;If my quotations don't imply that there are no other drugs in there, they certainly do demonstrate that any other drugs don't do any of the things that absinthe is claimed to do

Who's claims are you talking about? Some people report clarity and according to my erowid link (which cites [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10725394?dopt=Abstract)) this is plausible.

My discussion of veal is not off topic -- cows have to be repeatedly inseminated to produce milk (it is a total myth that they will keep producing as long as they are milked) and a by-product of this is unwanted male calfs that end up as veal (the females can be used for milk production once they get older, the males are killed as they are not the same breed as those more ""suitable"" for adult-beef). In a discussion on animal rights, and this as a fact of the dairy industry, it is entirely on topic!

You need to educate yourself -- there is no such thing as ""humane"" animal farming. You may want to visit www.humanemyth.org; www.milksucks.com; www.notmilk.com for some more information.

If the calfs are removed from them (at much distress to both animals), they would be emptying the udders, not humans. 

A cow (and human) can only produce milk if the right hormones are flowing (i.e. its not a “as long as there’s something yanking on my tit I’ll keep producing milk” process – when the baby is removed, the motherly hormones stop and the milk dries up. Left to her own devices she would produce just enough milk to feed her calf (which is not a profitable amount) who would suckle for up to a year if out in the open. 

Calfs are taken away almost immediately, at most after a few days. To produce milk in profitable quantities a dairy cow must be made pregnant every twelve months…Here are some totally non-vegan related sources (i.e agri-science links) that explain why it is efficient to artificially inseminate cows:

The graph on this link is also a useful visual:

There are countless others, these are the first few generated by google. I also have a very good friend who grew up on a dairy farm (a so-called ""humane"" one) (parents still run it) - she confirmed that this is what they do. 

Insemination involves a man putting a whole arm up the arse of the cow to position the uterus, then sticking a long dropper into the uterus to inseminate, all the while the cow is contained in (and I kid you not) what is called a “rape cage”. The semen is obtained by forcing to bulls to “mate”…. It’s quite gross, you can see at humanemyth.org. (Yes, that is one way and there are other, some literally masturbate them – yet this is somehow different from bestiality? - and some use artificial vaginas).

Just in case you still think dairy is somehow good for the cows, here is a list of 50 scientific / peer-reviewed studies that deal with the negative impacts of dairy farming for cows (industrial and non-industrial techniques alike). In general, dairy cows live far shorter lives due to heart disease (which has been associated with moarning their calfs), and complications during pregnancy / birth as well as severe cases of mastisus. There are more out there, these are just the first 50 I could quickly locate.

The documents cover the period from January 2007 to November 2008 and show that Pelosi made the equivalent of 20 round-trips between Washington (Andrews Air Force Base) and San Francisco. That's an average of less than one round-trip per month. In contrast, former Speaker Hastert traveled home to his Illinois district virtually every weekend and, his former aides tell ABC News, he would almost always travel on military aircraft.

Whatever... were I to accept that those incidents could be blamed entirely on capitalism, and that similar incidents would never happen under a socialist system (which frankly, seems like an absurd suggestion), those incidents and others would still come nowhere NEAR the scope and scale of the travesties which have occurred under oppressive socialist regimes.  NOWHERE NEAR.  

&gt;What we have in the United States is not a functional capitalist system.

Considering how wealthy we are, I'd have to disagree.  Even with the dead weight of millions of deadbeats leeching off the productive capacity of the responsible citizenry, even though we have been actively transferring massive amounts of wealth to third world countries for some 20 years (one would think that would make socialists happy...), we still maintain an incredibly high standard of living.  That we not only generate such extraordinary amounts of wealth but manage to continue doing so while spinning out wealth to the rest of the world is indicative that our economic system is actually functioning pretty damn well.  

&gt;It is a corporate socialist state that takes orders from the extremely wealthy.

We are definitely heading in that direction, but I don't think we are there yet.  Take a moment and step back from everything - put yourself a hundred miles above the earth, above the constant din of politics, and consider what's going on below.  We still have a functioning democracy.  That everyone thinks we have already devolved into a corporatist kleptocracy does not necessarily mean that we are there... yet.  Frankly, I am reassured that people are getting pissed off, because it means that people are close to actually doing something about it.  Contrary to what so many socialists think (and hope for), I don't think the US capitalist system is about to collapse, or is even anywhere near doing so.  People are very concerned with the budget deficits (and rightly so), and I think Republicans will win many seats in the upcoming elections - and this time, if they don't actually do something about the deficits, people will start to REALLY get pissed.  I don't know the exact mechanism by which we will solve our problems, but I do think they will be solved.  

&gt;Sure, this country, in theory, might be the wealthiest in the world, but that wealth is tied up in an extremely wealthy corporate oligarchy. I find that repugnant.

That wealth is not all ""tied up"" in the wealthy.  Do you not live a relatively comfortable life?  Unless you choose not to, you probably do.  If you decided to start up your own business, run it well, invest in it wisely, and expand, you could ""tie up"" some of that wealth for yourself!  Then, if you wanted to spread it around, absolutely no one could stop you from doing so... except for socialists, who might decide THEY would be better at redistributing your wealth than YOU, and that therefore they should be privy to whatever you earn.  It is obviously true that the wealthy in the US control a disproportionately large amount of wealth, but it is also true that the standard of living of the average American is also high.  Egalitarianism is a worthy goal, but it is not as worthy as the maintenance of [natural rights.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_and_legal_rights)  (There is a large body of philosophical work which makes an essentially unassailable argument for the superiority of natural rights above all else - you should read it before you make up your mind that egalitarianism is more important.)  If you work hard, you too can become rich, and you can do what you want with your money.   When the rich become so rich that the average American suffers, as long as our democratic system still functions, the American people will do something about it.  Until then, it is basically a non-issue.

&gt;I think the functioning democratic socialist states in Europe, like Norway and Sweden, can show a different route.

Then I think you should go live there, instead of trying to convert the US to their system.

&gt;Dissemination of statist propaganda? That's unique to socialist states? Ironic. I find this country's right-of-any-center politics to smack of that same intolerance of dissent.

When I say 'intolerance of dissent,' I don't meant that if your ideas suck, people will shout you down to let you know that - I mean that if your ideas run contrary to the states' ideas, then you will be silenced by the state.  I don't mean that if your protest of globalization ends up getting out of hand that the police will show up in riot gear, thump a few heads, haul a few people off to jail and release them the next day - I mean that the authorities will do everything in their power to prevent protests from occurring, and will not wait for them to get out of hand before attempting to disperse them.  If you agitate for something the state does not want, you might just end up in jail or indefinite house arrest, or worse.  Democracy and capitalism go hand in hand both philosophically and historically, as do authoritarianism and socialism. 

And no, Norway and Sweden do not count - they are capitalist systems where the government controls some portion of the means of production.  They are farther on the slider of Socialism &lt;-----&gt; Laissez-Faire capitalism than we are in the US, but they are not socialist.  

Even if they were, people love to hold those up as what we can have here, but the comparison is not apt.  Norway derives a large percentage of it's revenues from natural resources, and Sweden has been benefiting from steady economic liberalization since the 80's.  All of the Nordic countries derive a good bit of revenues from resource production, actually.  Another factor is their relatively homogeneous populations: when your people all share a common culture, they tend to respect the system, and will take only what they need from it.  Conversely, when you introduce people who are not a part of that culture into that system and offer them access to your welfare, they will tend to abuse it.  The large influx of immigrants in the last decade is becoming a problem across Europe - and especially in the Nordic countries - and welfare reform is a big issue over there.  

Want to see what low taxation, free trade, fiscal conservatism, and a general tendency towards laissez-faire capitalism will do for a nation?  [Here you go.](http://tinyurl.com/y8qpqha)

The country that I mentioned two posts ago as the only socialist country in Europe is Portugal.  It is the economic opposite of Switzerland in just about every way, and as I mentioned, it has the worst economy on the continent.  

Of course, there's also the obvious examples of China and Vietnam, who both still claim to be socialist, but after they gave up trying to control their economies in the 80's, experienced explosive economic growth.  I doubt either will trend back in the direction of socialism, and if they do, they WILL falter.  History is replete with such examples of capitalism creating wealth where socialism has failed - all you have to do is open your eyes and see the obvious.

You agitate for the middle path, yet since you've read Marx, I'm sure that you know that the middle path is a step towards socialism, and socialism is just the middle path between capitalism and communism.  If I actually believed that socialists and liberals wanted to stop at such a middle ground, I would be more willing to listen to their proposals.  Since I hold no such delusions, however, I will continue to do whatever I can to drag the slider back to the right.

Speculating what would have happened if US didn't exist at all is in my opinion a bit too far-reaching. Let's leav history behind and think of world where US would be neutral. Like before the WWII.

Europe countries have no guts after WWII. Germans, even though they could mount quite an impressive military force, are so afraid of the past that they wouldn't do anything. French are worried about their own security and the only ones that would do something about Taiwan would be Brits who have however out-stretched their military might.

Eastern Europe would fall under the power of Russia, China would be way more aggressive and have lot larger country than now. Human rights would be forgotten.

Even though many, very many people all over the world hate US and their imperialist methods, I can't figure out any preferable alternatives. Yes, in a perfect world every country would deal with their own problems and trade wouldn't be based on politics but that's not going to happen anytime soon.

As I live in Estonia, formerly occupied by USSR I feel much safer knowing that Russia wouldn't dare to attack us and I belive Taiwanese feel about the same.

US politics aren't fair to all but life never is and they have to respect human rights to at least some degree. Something similar to Tiananmen Square massacre couldn't possibly happen in the US we know today and that means more to me than always treating everybody equally.

There's nothing objectively wrong about the viewpoint of US culture.

1) George W. Bush left America and Obama with a under-funded, half-complete, wishy-washy objective when it came to the Constellation project (as well as the Wars, prescription drug benefits, almost everything else). Obama is some sense is setting reachable objectives and coming to the sobering realizations we need to get real things done.

2) Doesn't the world want more joint-exploration into space instead of many redundant national programs? The International Space Station, the greatest feat of engineering in human history, probably wouldn't have been feasible without an international effort. I think at this point, the US has no problem joining with Russia, Europe, Japan, India or even China to send humans to explore the Moon, asteroids, and beyond. If these nations want to be the first to copy-cat the Moon landing, by all means go ahead. Eventually, perhaps the competitive environment of many different nations in space will spur innovation, but we can probably agree that right now, good and feasible space exploration means many countries with their stakes and contributions pooled together.

3) The slowest leg in the serial process in getting people to the Moon has been developing a new heavy lift rocket. Between NASA taking its time translating Saturn V technology for the new mission, and Congress procrastinating on financing it, the Moon mission is pushed further beyond the 2020 horizon. Commercialization of rockets may in fact mean a fresh, innovative look at the technology, faster delivery, and more time for NASA to allocate for stuff to do when we actually land on the Moon. It's a risky proposal, and there should be a backup plan for a heavy lift rocket if commercialization fails to deliver, but it is a step that I think inevitably would have been done.",False,2,,False,novalidnameremains,True,1265053463,0,2,t5_2qh16,t3_awqhb,c0jsrn4,technology,0

However, population studies have been done on Askhenazi Jews. Here are two for now.
http://www.pnas.org/content/97/12/6769
&gt;The “among populations” variance component (ΦST) for the Ashkenazi, Roman, North African, Near Eastern, Kurdish, and Yemenite Jews (the lowest ΦST value of the five population groups analyzed in Table 2) indicated that these Jewish populations were not significantly different from one another.

There's also [this MDS graph](http://www.pnas.org/content/97/12/6769/F2.large.jpg) which uses the frequencies of Y-chromosome haplotypes to map clusters of genetic affinity. You'll see the Ashkenazi datum point is clustered with other Jewish populations.

&gt;Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that Diaspora Jews from Europe, Northwest Africa, and the Near East resemble each other more closely than they resemble their non-Jewish neighbors. 
...
&gt;Our results indicated a relatively minor contribution of European Y chromosomes to the Ashkenazim. {...} The extremely close affinity of Jewish and non-Jewish Middle Eastern populations observed here (Tables 2 and 3) supports the hypothesis of a common Middle Eastern origin

[PDF - Go to Page 6 of paper](http://www.familytreedna.com/pdf/43026_Doron.pdf)

The study looks at two haplo-groups that are overrepresented in a frequency comparison between Ashkenazi Jews and western Eurasian populations. Then by comparing the Ashkenazi mtDNA sequences within the two haplo-groups against other mtDNA sequences from the same groups, you can infer when and when the Askhenazi population was founded.

So the study concludes that over half of all Ashkenazis have one of four sequenced mtDNA sequences in those haplogroups that have a likely Near Eastern ancestry. This is important while we know the historical expansion of Ashkenazi Jews started in the Rhine river basin, we don't know where the population was actually established.

&gt;Likewise,the distribution of HgN1b in southwestern Asia and North
Africa (Rando et al. 1998;Richard set al. 2000) supports a Near Eastern, rather than a European, origin for this Hg.It is noteworthy that our extensive sample set from the Caucasus (table5) does not offer any hint that the four dominant Ashkenazi mtDNA lineages might have arrived from this region. However,it can be concluded that, irrespective of where exactly the mutations deﬁning these Ashkenazi lineages arose,their expansion clearly took place during the time period of the sojourn of the Ashkenazi population in Europe",False,1,,False,[deleted],True,1265057461,0,1,t5_2qh4r,t1_c0jsa6q,c0jsxre,conspiracy,0

Also, if you can't afford insurance, and are mentally ill, you may want to look into medicaid. That's what those resources are there for. There's no shame in getting help if you need it.

However, one day I made the decision that I wasn't going to be on medication anymore and I wasn't going to be effected by mental illness, that was about 7 years ago and ever since then my life has been a roaring success. I identified what my ""triggers"" were and developed coping mechanisms. For me, it was my family, especially my mother (she was very abusive). Once she was out my life, it just got better and better. Employing the above mechanisms I have been able to live, and live happily, with my mental illness; and I hope the same for you.

I know where you are...I  have worked really crappy jobs, only to get fired from them. From the age of 16 to 23 my life was just a procession of failures. I have been where you are but life can be so much different. Honestly, from where I was to where I am now is amazing. I now make over €75,000 per year, working in IT in one of Europe's largest banks.

We were in parallel classes in our school, but never really talked or anything before getting together. We both went to an open day at the university in town to check out possible carreer possibilities and we met at some computer science presentation (was about game theory, really interesting but that's another story). We started talking a bit and it didn't take a genius to see she was madly in love with me. We fooled around at her place one day, but she didn't want to ask me out and make things awkward, so you can imagine how happy she was when I popped the question myself.

When I say madly in love I mean it, you can't imagine how good she was taking care of me. If I'd rub my leg she'd make sure I wasn't hurt, if I'd stay over there was alwyas breakfast waiting for me after some morning nooky, she even took me with her to visit the States one summer for free. Still, like every couple we had our ups and downs (slight case of bipolarism) but nothing too bad really.

The end of school was nearing and I already knew she was going to move back to the States so there was no future to us. Long story short, I managed to break up with her on our one year anniversary. And I had sex with her best friend the weekend after. That was her first time. I don't even know what I got into my head back then, something about wanting to see what else is out there or some bullshit like that. If I'd see my younger self I'd punch him in the face and then some. This was the biggest asshole thing I could have possibly done... She didn't eat for a week, she dropped out of school because she couldn't see me anymore, I think it's safe to say I broke her heart.


And the craziest thing is, that she forgave me in a way. We still chat online, send the occasional care package with Europe/US exclusives and a little post card. That really fucks with my mind sometimes. I always hear about people never being able to be on friendly terms with their exes, and wit hus we actually have a healthy friendly relationship going.

While a few British officers had started imitating French officers during the Napoleonic Wars who spotted the moustache that had learned from the Spanish that a man of resolution wore whiskers.

In India, the British discovered that their sepoys were not amused that their British had no moustaches. The sepoys believed moustaches to be a sign of virility. And they laughed at the bare-lipped British, thinking that they were effete and feeble.

The lower officers began sporting moustaches in the 1830s but it took quite some time for the officers to start wearing them. In 1854 moustaches were made compulsory for European troops in the Bombay unit of the army and were enthusiastically adopted everywhere else.

I believe the size of the British officers' moustache grew proportionately to the expansion of the British Empire. In England, an industry grew supplying items to maintain the moustache. In some cases, moustaches were even clipped and trimmed until they were curved like sabers and bristled like bayonets. Even British civilians began to stiffen their upper lips.

As the moustache became a symbol of British rule and superiority, the Indian servants of the Raj were forbidden to have fancy moustaches. The most symbolic of the Moustache Movement was a poster of [Lord Horatio Herbert Kitchner's]( http://www.sterlingtimes.org/kitchener.jpg) recruiting effort during the Great War in 1914.

In terms of hardware, the rules are simple: don't buy anything with a 528MHz Qualcomm or worse CPU in it - a genuinely ""smart"" phone should have a ""smart"" CPU that should cope with more than the occasional text message - and a feature-rich OS will place added demand on the CPU.

Which brings us to the second topic, the OS. The main Smartphone OSes right now are iPhone OS, Android, WebOS, Maemo, Symbian, Blackberry OS, and Windows Mobile. Of those, I've tried all of them except Maemo. Of those I've tried, WebOS is the nicest, followed by by iPhone OS, Android, WinMo, Blackberry OS, and last (and very much least) Symbian. The OS you chose will make two major differences - the general ""feel"" of the phone (intuitive UI, useful visual cues, general feel of ""slickness"" and user response), and availability of apps (iPhone leads, Android second, everyone else somewhere in the dumpster).

So. Where does all this lead? First, decide on a few key points like ""do I want a keyboard?"" - then decide on questions like ""is it the early '90s"" (which helps eliminate all Symbian devices). You should eventually end up with a shortlist of devices like the Palm Pre, iPhone 3GS, Nokia N900, and a couple of Android devices like the Motorola Droid or Google Nexus One. Final step: go try them out in person. I don't know about your country, but in the UK, you should have no trouble trying out a smartphone if you walk into a mobile network's high street store &amp; ask for a play. The phone which best suits you as an individual should rise to the top.

Personally, I have an HTC Hero (the proper EU model with a chin, not the gimped US version).

If I am wrong, please correct me. If yes though, then surely you must support the French or any other revolution that occurred in support of liberal (bourgeois) democracy. Historically speaking, those revolutions occurred because interests of the ascendent class, capitalists, came into direct conflict with those of the old order, the feudal aristocracy. Without those revolutions, the peasantry would have never been freed from the land or tithe, and as such, could not develop into the working class. Those revolutions were progressive in character. They brought greater freedoms and (near) universal suffrage to the masses. Ergo, without said revolutions, global capitalism, markets, and for that matter, the modern world, could not exist.

Incremental, e.g. parliamentary change, in the long run, is ineffective--that's why revolutions have a tendency to occur over and over. Typically, serious and necessary legislative reform only occurs due to the threat of revolution. The *threat* of violence through militant action is merely the impetus of change in those circumstances. George Lansbury, MP and leader of Labour from 1932-35, went as far as saying that the The Unemployment Insurance Act 1920 was ""not so much to safeguard the lives of men and their families but, as Lord Derby had recently told them, to forestall revolution"". Men in the army were included among the insured, because at the time, the government was not quite sure whether they would turn their rifles in the direction desirable to the government. That's merely one of many historical examples.

Besides, if you think I am acting as some sort of apologist for the Stalinist dictatorships of Eastern Europe, or elsewhere for that matter, you are mistaken.

But Y2K accomplished very little.  Y2K was from the standpoint of progress, entirely an unfortunately waste of technology.  To have to redo all those COBOL programs took millions of dollars and diverted it.   With out it, there could have been slightly reduced financial strain.   But more importantly, what could have been done with investment could have created far more room for growth.   All Y2K did was to rescue legacy systems.

The ""dot com"" boom and technology may look synonymous to some people.  But they aren't.   How do you blame the upsurge in growth of EU and Asian technology and networks after 2001 on the ""dot com"" boom? 
The creation of technology during that era was in no way false even though speculation clearly was inflated. 

&gt; IT infrastructure jobs have a bad habit of being the victims of their own success.

When? There is absolutely nothing in the entire history of automation to create that expectation.  

Inflated investment expectations and temporary inventories that we could not ship are no reason to conflate dot com and technology or IT technology.  The fact is, in technology wasn't really a boom at all.   Not in same sense as the housing boom where housing prices advanced far faster than what is natural.     Unless you consider that the technology ""boom"" started in about 1687...

&gt;Of course, we could just as easily recreate that effect with some other localized labor need. Just as soon as someone figures out what that need is. Maybe we'll get lucky and the next one won't be a temporary project.

There's a problem.  You're calling Y2K a temporary project which is true.  But you can't then call it the ""Clinton boom"" because we all had to deal with Y2K.   It had nothing to do with policy.  Y2K itself just meant that we threw away some of the benefit. 

From 1998 through Y2K and after, we had low unemployment month after month after month of 4.1%.. 3.8% ..3.9%.   Since 6/2001 we have had zero months of less than 4.4%, only 3 months at 4.4%.

However, the major difference I see between mainstream followers of various Abrahamic religions is that some tend to be more selective readers than others.  Each branch is comprised of innumerable tributaries of crazy, but I find that traditions touched by the history of the continent of Europe are more likely to allow a separation of civil and religious law.  

Furthermore, coexistence with a separate state and an intense history of global trade and colonialism has allowed a vast mixing of ideas.  The result of which is that religious people from cosmopolitan regions are able to ignore or emphasize certain parts of their ritualized gnosis over inconvenient parts.   The success of religious colonization always relies on moral suasion, and that requires a keen sense of the demands imposed by reality rather than fictions.

Islam is just as much fractionated by regionalized culture and hadith.  If a culture is insular, and has dealt itself a marginalized role in recent history, it is going to be xenophobic.  If economic trends have obliterated traditional expectations of each member of a generation's place and responsibility to their community, then there is going to be an intense reactionary political current.  

Essentially, Islam was in its death throes in the seventies in most places.  However, population pressures and regional politics have allowed it to surge into relevance once more.  You can't put the genie back into the bottle though.  The weight of the developed world is simply too great in terms of cultural dominance, economic possibility, and the wealth of accumulated human knowledge and ideas that inundate any society previously deprived of contact.  

Interestingly, these reactionary movements are dominated by youth, since in developing countries they usually comprise the bulk of the population.  The youth aren't renown for their great experience or wisdom, but for passion.  I have a feeling that political Islam, despite contemporary demographic trends, is simply a fad that will pass like any other failed ideology.

I don't really feel qualified to discuss whether or not Afro-American studies are racist; you can get degrees in European history and art just fine.

&gt;That it is politically palatable to not support similar services for male victims is a disgrace

I think you're exaggerating, to put it mildly. Has someone tried to get funding for a male shelter and got told to fuck off?

&gt;To carefully and systematically exclude one half of the population from this message is disgusting and deplorable. The implication that violence which targets men is acceptable - or at least more acceptable is inappropriate and wrong.

The thing is that those campaigns originate from a time when beating your wife used to be socially acceptable. I'm sorry you feel so threatened.

Also: fighting is allowed if not encouraged in hockey. I definitely get the impression that we're OK with *some* amount of violence between dudes.

&gt;Your suggestion that I believe judges should be more lenient during custody battles is further evidence of your narrow view. How on earth could you reach that conclusion?

Well... because I believe it's an area where men are genuinely discriminated against. Are you that one guy who believes ""feminazis"" are out to get you but also happen to think divorce court is perfectly fair?

&gt;It is my observation that you are so entirely blinded by your pre-judgement as to make your opinion meaningless.

""Opinions contrary to mine are wrong!""

While science is affected by the values of the ones doing the research, that doesn't necessarily make it bad: it should only affect the questions asked, not the answers, as long as the researcher values truth above what they want to believe (or are paid to show).

Most science has things that are not well understood, large or small variances between reality and predictions. Still, science represents our best understanding of absolute reality.

Back to the point... Over here, discrimination is illegal in most places.

Now sadly, as we all know, discrimination is still present on every step and said minorities do not, as a collective, live equally fulfilling lives.

These minorities build up a distrust and dislike for the majority over generations. After being reminded on every step for centuries that they're second class citizens, they huddle together in closed communities and look at any member of the majority with at least suspicion. If one of them becomes a famous football player, that doesn't change a fucking thing.

So.. What is reverse racism? It's this distrust of the majority by a socio-economically subordinated minority. It **is** racism by definition but it's induced through years of abuse rather than exercised as a luxury by a member of the majority.

Also, if the minority were to mysteriously rise to a position of social equality, so-called reverse racism would decrease dramatically, and the existing normal household racism would either stay the same or increase.

What we're seeing right now is China showing off its newly acquired muscle against a the current superpower and testing its boundaries. It's a diplomatic move where they gnaw as the US international supremacy while trying to force them to make a stupid move so that they can turn back to the rest of the planet and say  ""Look, the bully is being mean to me!!"". It's a strategy the US is not accustomed to fight so well since they've been used to be on top of a pedestal and it will take them some time for them to adjust but eventually they will.

Finally the ""war"" is already on, but this time it's economical and cultural. The best move for the US/west would be an heart and mind campaign on a planetary scale.

You don't need to predict anything. Earthquakes happen all the time. All you need to do is wait for one to happen and pull the trigger.

Earthquakes happen very regularly in the haiti area too so they probably timed it to one the happened somewhere near port au prince anyway.

I paid a total of $1100 for two full suits, a silk kimono, a wool and silk dinner jacket, three pairs of trousers, and six shirts.  Hand-tailored within three days to my exact measurements and customization specifications, three to four fittings, top notch material.  It's all a joy to wear.  The suits were $160 each (so a bit more than 100 euros).  Many Asian tailors will try to rip you off, trying to talk you into buying a suit with two or even one fitting sessions.

$1100 wouldn't even buy a pair of fully bespoke trousers of the same quality and materials in Europe (high-end tailors will charge around $5k for a full suit).  Until now, I'd thought the suits I'd bought when I started working for about the same as the whole clothing package (which I intend to have for years) were a great deal, super well fitting, comfortable, etc., but man...never again.

The downside is that if you want a well-cut suit, you really have to know what you're looking for.  I can go into Brooks Brothers and buy a Golden Fleece outfit, and I know it'll be well stitched, have great Super 180 wool, and generally last forever.  I can judge on the spot if a jacket fits reasonably well, and that's that; if it breaks, I bring it back and they fix it for me.  If I go to a tailor, though, I'd better (a) know the guy's reputable, (b) have time to try stuff on, and (c) know exactly what I'm talking about and looking for (most good Asian tailors I've seen will not proactively make suggestions, but will do whatever you tell them, so if you're slightly unsure or off the mark it can look like shit.)

In my country, it's about 50% though they are considered superior to the state-run schools. This is all mostly a purely historical affair, and the actual influence of the Church is minimal to non-existent. I went to a catholic primary school, a catholic high school and a catholic university. The only difference with the state-run schools are a higher education standard, a completely optional mass once or twice a year and about 5 mentions of the word ""God"" per month. Except in university, where I had one single 20 hour course on religious influence in society and the word was used slightly more frequent due to the many funny cartoons about creationism between slides.

Sorry to hear that.  It's just hasn't been that way historically.   Try and grok this: Relative to the rest of the world, telcos decimated the U.S.  IT network in 2001-2004.    Relative to Japan and Korea for instance... but also relative to EU, to China.  

U.S. status as ""the best network in the world"" declined and fell and was demolished over the past decade.  No wonder it's been hard on network admins.


Otherwise, total IT employees has grown at about 1.5% per year except  for generally minor downturns during recessions.  The 2001 recession was especially bad.  And it followed guess what?  Y2K....

http://www.beyondvc.com/it_spending.jpg



I'm not saying Y2K wasn't important.  It saved IT from chaos.  However, note that each time we ""save"" something ""from chaos"" it's very at a heavy cost to our economy.  

&gt;&gt;   But Y2K accomplished very little.

&gt; I saw programmers making money they hadn't seen in 20 years.

That's not an answer.  In 2008, we saw bankers and stock portfolio managers making more money than they ever have!   Certainly more money than their customers made...

What advancement in technology did Y2K accomplish OTHER THAN what was stated?   What did it achieve **OTHER THAN** saving legacy systems?   

It was expensive.  But it did nothing to create new technology.   Nothing at all.   The result of Y2K was not to advance into system integration in any way.  It in fact served rigidify enterprise integration, make it more brittle, and reduce the funding and willingness to later advance integration engineering.

Y2K was an enormous cost hit and resulted in inflexibility.    

&gt; By itself Y2k was responsible for billions in economic activity. 

A cost hit.  Achieving what?   Admit it.

&gt; Aside from the dust balls pulled out of retirement to fix old code, there was a massive investment in new equipment

Creating what new kinds of advances?

&gt; and a movement of labor across the job spectrum. 

Creating what?


&gt; It wasn't just the programmers coming out of retirement to fix old code. 

I agree - not ""out of retirement.""  But clearly it was fixing old code...  How can you say it wasn't?  Where did those jobs go after Y2K?  Not into software...  There was nothing for them to flow into.  Ever read Tracy Kidder's book ""Soul of a new machine.""  Little or nothing new was created by Y2K in comparison to the size of the field.

African children received especially horrible treatment from white American and European christian missionaries, and also local homegrown black African missionaries.  In the christian missionaries' boarding schools, orphanages, and medical clinics, wide spread abuses included murder, sexual abuse, being sold into slavery,  forced feeding of vomit and feces, other forms of torture, and severe beatings.   All christian faith missionaries usually establish an association in one or several villages to form a critical mass of whites to educate their own children, purchase food, share transportation, and form a common defense if the locals have a problem with any of the missionaries.  I knew some missionaries who operated in Africa in the 1960s as part of such an association; they were unhappy with the RCC priest.  He would select a beautiful child to accompany him on his monthly trips to see his superiors.  When he returned to the village, the child who left with him never returned, and there were no accusations or questions.  Just another black child disappeared in Africa under the charge of a white missionary -- no one cared.  The other missionaries kept their mouths shut about their suspicions (sexual abuse, followed by selling into slavery) because most of them had evil baggage, and if all were exposed, the African government would expel them all.  According to KW Daniels, all christian faiths have evil missionaries, not just the RCC.  
I look forward to a vigorous investigation in Haiti of these Baptist trafficking in children.  And, I suspect that KW Daniels does also.

She responded, ""Well, yeah... but so are a lot of things I do. I still tell lies and all that. No one is perfect. Who am I to judge a gay person for what they do? That's not my place.""

(2) The US is an artifically created nation. Its people never lived through the Middle Ages, which has resulted in a disconnect with people in Western Europa.

Both USican and European churches are socially conservative, but over here they're much more into making up for this by helping people. Indeed, even in my country (the Netherlands, 40% atheist) we refer to the ""Christian thing to do"" as something positive - helping someone in need.

I think the American left would like to think it is pushing the country more in the direction of European-style governance. However, they are in practice implementing a new version of it that is influenced by business interests more than the European system. The health care plan in the works a while back illustrates this perfectly: individual freedom is lessened by the government's mandate that people purchase health insurance. Rather than a solution that was made with the interests of the people in mind, they chose one with the interests of their corporate masters.

And while Europe is much different from the USSR or China, keep in mind that this thread is about socialism, a system which China and the USSR claimed to implement. As I said, Europe doesn't properly qualify as socialist. They may be closer to socialism on a political scale than the US, but European countries don't claim to be socialist or to implement socialism. They're social democracies.

*Also, I think a number of experts on both Russian and Chinese history would argue that the totalitarian nature of those governments had more to do with the people who enacted them than with socialism itself; e.g. especially in the USSR, socialism was in many ways just a populist appeal that allowed despots to cow the people.*

Christians seem compelled to lie to advance their religious agenda, which is now a purely political one.  I got this gem from christians:

&gt; Muslim Belief:
&gt; 
&gt; This is a true story and the author, Rick Mathes, is a well-known leader in
&gt; prison ministry.  The man who walks with God always gets to his destination.
&gt; If you have a pulse you have a  purpose.
&gt; 
&gt; The Muslim religion is the fastest growing religion per capita in the United
&gt; States , especially in the minority races !!!  Last month I attended my annual
&gt; training session that's required for maintaining my state prison security
&gt; clearance.  During the training session there was a presentation by three
&gt; speakers representing the Roman Catholic, Protestant and Muslim faiths, who
&gt; explained each of their beliefs.
&gt; 
&gt; I was particularly interested in what the Islamic Imam had to say.  The Imam
&gt; gave a great presentation of the basics of Islam, complete with a video..
&gt; After the presentations, time was provided for questions and answers.  When it
&gt; was my turn, I directed my question to the Imam and asked:
&gt; 
&gt; 'Please, correct me if I'm wrong, but I understand that most Imams and clerics
&gt; of Islam have declared a holy jihad [Holy war] against the infidels of the
&gt; world and, that by killing an infidel, (which is a command to all Muslims) they
&gt; are assured of a place in heaven.  If that's the case, can you give me the
&gt; definition of an infidel?'
&gt; 
&gt; There was no disagreement with my statements and, without hesitation, he
&gt; replied, 'Non-believers!' I responded, 'So, let me make sure I have this
&gt; straight.  All followers of Allah have been commanded to kill everyone who is
&gt; not of your faith so they can have a place in heaven..  Is that correct?'
&gt; 
&gt; The expression on his face changed from one of authority and command to that of
&gt; a little boy who had just been caught with his hand in the cookie jar..'
&gt; 
&gt; He sheepishly replied, 'Yes.'
&gt; 
&gt; I then stated, 'Well, sir, I have a real problem trying to imagine Pope John
&gt; Paul commanding all Catholics to kill those of your faith or Dr. Stanley
&gt; ordering all Protestants to do the same in order to guarantee them a place in
&gt; heaven!'
&gt; 
&gt; The Imam was speechless!
&gt; 
&gt; I continued, 'I also have a problem with being your friend when you and your
&gt; brother clerics are telling your followers to kill me!  Let me ask you a
&gt; question:  Would you rather have your Allah, who tells you to kill me in order
&gt; for you to go to heaven, or my Jesus who tells me to love you because I am
&gt; going to heaven and He wants you to be there with me?'
&gt; 
&gt; You could have heard a pin drop as the Imam hung his head in shame.  Needless
&gt; to say, the organizers and/or promoters of the Diversification training seminar
&gt; were not happy with my way of dealing with the Islamic Imam, and exposing the
&gt; truth about the Muslims' beliefs.
&gt; 
&gt; In twenty years there will be enough Muslim voters in the  U.S.  to elect
&gt; the President!
&gt; 
&gt; I think everyone in the  U.S.  should be required to read this, but with ACLU,
&gt; there is no way this will be widely publicized, unless each of us send it on!
&gt; This is your chance to make a difference...  
&gt; 
&gt; FOR GODS' SAKE !  SEND THIS ON !


##I replied:

 The story is based on an incident at a correctional facility in Missouri.  The
actual facts, however, couldn't be more different:

From [Snopes:](http://www.snopes.com/politics/religion/allah.asp)

&gt;According to Tim Kniest, Public Information Officer for the Missouri Department of Corrections, the event described was a training program prison volunteers, for which ministers from several faiths were invited to give presentations in order to acquaint prison volunteers with the varied religious beliefs of the inmate population. The man who gave the presentation about Islam was not a Muslim minister; he was an inmate pressed into service to present a short film on Islam and answer some questions when the prison's Volunteer Coordinator was ""unable to find Imam to speak."" Moreover, reported Mr. Kniest, the prison's Volunteer Coordinator said that ""The inmate did a good job,"" adding, ""He was asked &gt;a few questions that were beyond his ability to answer. But he was not asked anything like that question [in the editorial]"":
&gt;
&gt;*the Volunteer Coordinator at the prison said that no such exchange as the editorial reported ever took place. ""He certainly did not 'Hang his head in shame',"" according to Kniest. In fact, the inmate was thanked by the assembly before being escorted back to his quarters. Furthermore, the coordinator does not recall any questions dealing with jihad [Holy war] against the infidels of the world as reported in the editorial.  In the editorial the inmate is presented as an Imam, or Islamic minister, which he clearly was not.*

Even if you can look past the fact that people seem unable to avoid bare-faced lying in order to justify their 'faith', this is one of the most hypocritical comparisons of two religions written.  For example, the christian has a hard time believing that the Pope would order catholics to kill muslims.  *Yet throughout the middle ages, that's exactly what happened throughout christendom in Europe.*  Popes in the middle ages deliberated on whether or not killing muslims in the name of the lord was right or not, then decided it was okay and preached just that.  

The list of atrocities committed by christians in the name of their religion up to today would fill a shelf of books.  [The crusades took the lives of about 1.5 million nonbelievers, the roll of christianity across northern europe took the lives of about 2 million Saxon and Scandinavian non believers.](http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat0.htm)  The number of people burned for being witches is so high that historians have a hard time getting an accurate count.  M. D. Aletheia, in The Rationalist's Manual (1897): estimated that 9,000,000 were burned by christians for witchcraft.  That seems high to me, and others estimate it at only between 30,000 and 50,000.

So, like a true hypocrite, this idiot wants us to judge all of Islam by the
worst moments of some groups, but not christianity.  The bible also commands that non-believers be put to death (2 Chronicles 15:13) and for a host of other infractions: not listening to priests (Deut 17:12); swearing at your parents (Lev 20:9); following another religion (Deut 13:7-12); not being a virgin on your wedding night (Deut 22:20-21); so forth and so on.  But that's not an accurate representation of what the vast majority of christians believe and practice, any more than this sad little bag of lies is an accurate representation of what the vast majority of muslims believe. 

Even more two-faced, this just looks like a cheap fear tactic to whip up political action.  Which, by this account, is all christianity in the USA is about at this point.  Perhaps you can tell what a religion is really about by how often and how big the lies are that it compels its followers to engage in.

Accurate. Not poor.  And lets not make this like racism, sexism, or homophobia.  This is a disagreement in worldviews.

There may have been debate, but the idea that Europeans ""forgot"" or that Christians suppressed the fact that the world is round IS the myth. In fact, a Christian theologian who asserted the world was flat was viewed as a heretic.

The myth was started by Washington Irving in the 1800's and (as much as I wish this wasn't true) used by early proponents of the theory of evolution, including Darwin, to ridicule his opponents.

&gt;Research Octane Number (RON)
The most common type of octane rating worldwide is the Research Octane Number (RON). RON is determined by running the fuel in a test engine with a variable compression ratio under controlled conditions, and comparing the results with those for mixtures of iso-octane and n-heptane.
[edit] Motor Octane Number (MON)

&gt;There is another type of octane rating, called Motor Octane Number (MON), or the aviation lean octane rating, which is a better measure of how the fuel behaves when under load as it is done at 900 rpm instead of the 600 rpm of the RON[2][3]. MON testing uses a similar test engine to that used in RON testing, but with a preheated fuel mixture, a higher engine speed, and variable ignition timing to further stress the fuel's knock resistance. Depending on the composition of the fuel, the MON of a modern gasoline will be about 8 to 10 points lower than the RON. Normally, fuel specifications require both a minimum RON and a minimum MON.[citation needed]
[edit] Anti-Knock Index (AKI)

&gt;In most countries, including all of those of Australia and Europe the ""headline"" octane rating shown on the pump is the RON, but in Canada, the United States and some other countries,[which?] the headline number is the average of the RON and the MON, called the Anti-Knock Index (AKI). It may also sometimes be called the Road Octane Number (RdON), Pump Octane Number (PON), or (R+M)/2.
[edit] Difference between RON and AKI

&gt;Because of the 8 to 10 point difference noted above, the octane rating shown in the United States is 4 to 5 points lower than the rating shown elsewhere in the world for the same fuel. See the table in the following section for a comparison.

As someone who has traveled to Africa twice (Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya and Ethiopia), you shouldn't assume that there is one linear path to development. Africans were never on track to become a western power. They have a far more community based society then the west. Who knows where the continent would have ended up, but it certainly would not be in the position it’s in today... Edit: i would also like to add that Africa inst just a content of starving children and HIV/AIDs certain parts of kigali would make you believe your in Europe. 


&gt;The slaves were taken from their villages primarily because they were already behind the times.


NO. They were taken because Europeans established forts on Western Africa and made deals with African tribes to exchange guns (among other things) for slaves. The European powers lacked the military might at the time to venture inland themselves (despite their advanced weaponry). These African tribes then waged war further inland with other tribes and delivered the slaves to the Europeans. This process was incredibly destructive. It had nothing to do with being behind the times.  


&gt;The resources were not taken by slavers in America


I never claimed America was involved directly in colonialism. But since you mentioned Americas role perhaps you should look into the oil companies shady deals with African dictators (may of which are illegal according to international law).*source: the scramble for Africa’s oil (book). Or Riggs Bank (American) which was illegally laundering Equatorial Guinea's oil revenues for its president. These American companies are facilitating the conditions in Africa through illegal means. Now, how did the dictators get there in the first place? well look back to how most European powers handed over control to African leaders… 


&gt;You can't say slavery is responsible for it being a terrible place.


Yes, I can and I did. But I would like to add that colonialism was just as, if not more, destructive. Colonialism only ended ~45 years ago and left the continent in an unbelievable mess. Read up on how Belgium left the Congo or the Europeans role in creating and dividing the hutu and tutsi (ie Rwandan genocide). Do you honestly believe these events didn’t or shouldn’t have had any influence on modern Africa? I can give you many more examples if you want. This doesn’t even touch on the effects of neo-colonialism. 


&gt;The population has had plenty of time to rebuild, and plenty of able bodied workers should be available now.


Its like starting a race by giving yourself a 400 year head start and breaking your opponents legs.


Edit #2: I understand your reasoning (from other posts)... but i think your missing the point. It shouldn't matter if your family or my family had participated in slavery or not.

We need to examine how outside influences have, and are continuing to, unfairly treat these people and do something about it.

Microeconomics would argue with you on this point. You seem to be looking at market wages and the wage you need to pay your employees and then making this conclusion. The problem with that is that without payroll taxes, market wages would be higher. I can prove this, because I do a lot of independent consulting work via 1099 relationship. In such an arrangement, I am responsible for the full payroll tax. When I am asked for my rate, it is understood that I have one rate for 1099 relationship and a different rate for W2 relationship. This is due to a number of things, one of which is payroll taxes.

&gt; It is distributed across local, state and federal but an adequate accounting package tracks all of this.

How many individuals do you know that track their taxes with an accounting package? The reality is that most people don't even understand that their income tax rate only applies to the marginal amount above the lower tax bracket. And you want them to be able to understand their total tax picture? Pipe dream.

Over 90% of this earth believe in some form of God.    The only majorly practiced religion that comes the closest to being a positive force on this earth is Zen Buddhists.  (Certainly not the Jain's).

Then he has to pay a little under hundred Euro for his medical insurance, another twenty as broadcasting fees and no idea how much for his car insurance. Toss in the fees for mandatory inspections and repairs (much higher than anywhere in US, take my word for it).

So far, none of these things are optional and must be paid by everybody.

That said, it would be difficult to argue that either of those societies ever witnessed the growth of full-blown humanism, dependent as they both were on slave labor for their social stability.

There's more than simply correlation to tie the historical emergence of humanism to Christianity, and here, again, the question of slave society is useful as a reference point.  The Christian doctrine of the soul led tended to make slavery a much stickier issue than it was in earlier European civilizations, precisely because it threw so much emphasis on individual responsibility and moral choice.  As a result, the dissolution of the Roman Empire signaled the end of main stream slavery in Europe, at least until the 15th century when the opening of reliable slave channels to Africa and the New World provided a strong economic impetus and the racial differential on which the Atlantic Slave Trade thrived.

In other words, the formal link noted by historians is that Christianity served as an ideological crucible in which the importance of the individual, not as an economic or social unit but as a moral agent, could grow.

Music, for fuck's sake.

Published:

By: 
Emma Kemp

Stem celli biology is highly topical and is attracting great interest not only within the research community but also from politicians, patient groups and the general public. However, the standard of publications in the field is very variable. Papers that are scientifically flawed or comprise only modest technical increments often attract undue profile. At the same time publication of truly original findings may be delayed or rejected. At the recent EuroSyStem/EMBO Conference on Advances in Stem Cell Research there was much discussion about the peer review process. Peer review is the guardian of scientific legitimacy and should be both rigorous and constructive. Indeed most scientists spend considerable time and thought reviewing manuscripts. As authors we have all benefited from insightful referee reports that have improved our papers. We have also on occasion experienced unreasonable or obstructive reviews.

We suggest a simple step that would greatly improve transparency, fairness and accountability; when a paper is published, the reviews, response to reviews and associated editorial correspondence could be provided as Supplementary Information, while preserving anonymity of the referees. We note that this procedure has recently been adopted by The EMBO Journal. We wish to encourage other journals to follow suit and would like to hear your considered opinions.

This letter and your replies will be disseminated via the EuroSyStem website (www.eurosystemproject.eu) and EuroStemCell.org. You may post your comments directly at http://eurostemcell.org/commentanalysis/peer-review

I generally believe that there may have been a free-love hippie type of guy named Jesus. I don't think he had any superpowers as described by the bible. I don't think he was divine in any sense of the word. I feel that the majority of the stories where he is the protagonist are about as truthful as any of the other allegories in the bible. Which is to say, not at all. Jesus as protagonist may as well have been named ""Joe Everyman"". The point of trying to make him into a physical person and deify him came later and I do believe misses the point of what the bible was trying to teach. Historically the bible wasn't written until about 300 odd years after he was dead. Considering the state of literacy and the 'followers' who were the poor and downcast (and therefore completely illiterate in that society) the likelihood of any true story of this person making it to 300 years hence is pretty much nil. Paul Bunyan has more historical accuracy than Jesus in my opinion. Stop worshiping the man and start believing in what he stood for. That was what was supposed to be to point of Jesus. 

The contemporary Church in the US (or pretty much anywhere) is a fractured, perverted, self-serving economic entity which survives by convincing its patrons to donate in a tithe like system. The main church set itself up in the middle ages as the one and only way to access 'God' and the only way for redemption. The church still maintains that the only way to be a good person is through actions of the church; be it volunteering or donating. The ability for the individual to be their own salvation, their own God, threatens the church more than any pedophilic priests. The church today attempts to control its followers and exclude those who are different.

The premise was that it cost too much to develop new engines, so with lower sulphur content, the car manufacturers could instead import engines currently used in Europe, some of which get 70mpg. The dollar slid to the point where it no longer became economical to do so. 

Back in the late 70s, early 80s, diesel powered cars were common, but due to various economic factors, they fell out of favor. Partly due to diesel costing more than gas, and partly due to the shitty engines used.

There's his ideals that people take selectively (love thy neighbour, except abortionists and faggots, that kind of thing), the failed predictions that he made about the end times occurring in the generation of those who still lived. Some say that that describes the sacking of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 AD but the life expectancy was around thirty five to forty years at that time, and Jesus would have preached that around 28-30 AD, so either he was just scraping it, or he was just as wrong.
Oh, also, didn't rise from the dead. To be fair, the only people who 'saw' him were his disciples, and what is going to sound the best to the following Jesus amassed; ""Erm, yeah, he's dead, woops"" or ""We have seen him! He has resurrected! All hail to God!"" etc.?

First:  Very very divided. I was amazed how many long adjectives are employed to seperate the different groups. Just being protestant or catholic didn't seem to be enough.
Second: How very strong and influential it is in politics but especially in every day life. Compared to the US church  the churches of almost all other western countries are midgets. 
Third: I think that people mold their religion to fit their beliefs and morals instead of the  other way round. So the contemporary church is a good representation of what the current population wants to believe in.

[Economy of ancient Greece](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Ancient_Greece)

-  The economy of ancient Greece was characterized by the extreme importance of importing goods, all the more so because of the relative poverty of Greece's soil. Beginning in the 6th century B.C., craftsmanship and commerce (principally maritime) developed and became increasingly more important in the classical period.

[Ancient Roman Economy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome#Economy)

-  Ancient Rome commanded a vast area of land, with tremendous natural and human resources. As such, Rome's economy remained focused on farming and trade. 

-  In manufacturing, production was on a relatively small scale, and generally consisted of workshops and small factories that employed at most dozens of workers. However, some brick factories employed hundreds of workers.

[Economy of England Starting at Medieval Times](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_England#History)

-  In medieval times (c. 11th–15th century), the wool trade was the major industry of England and the country exported wool to Europe. Many market towns and ports grew up on the industry

-  [more about export economy](http://www.jstor.org/pss/2593912)

[Economic history of the Ottoman Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_the_Ottoman_Empire)

-  The first is the classic era (enlargement), which comprised a closed agricultural economy, showing regional distinctions within the empire.

-  The Ottomans saw military expansion and fiscalism as the main source of wealth, with agriculture seen as more important than manufacture and commerce.[1] Western mercantilists gave more emphasis to manufacture and industry in the wealth-power-wealth equation, moving towards capitalist economics comprising expanding industries and markets whereas the Ottomans continued along the trajectory of territorial expansion, traditional monopolies, conservative land holding and agriculture

[The Ancient Assyrians](http://ancienthistory.suite101.com/article.cfm/the_ancient_assyrians#ixzz0eQaEOIUQ)

-  The fertile soil of the region allowed the Assyrians to have a booming farming economy. As the empire grew into new lands, other industries were explored and exploited, including mining and forestry.

[Egyptian Economy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt#Government_and_economy)

-  Farmers made up the bulk of the population

-  Artists and craftsmen were of higher status than farmers, but they were also under state control, working in the shops attached to the temples and paid directly from the state treasury.

-   Below the nobility were the priests, physicians, and engineers with specialized training in their field. 

It's mostly wikipedia, and I know some ppl hate it as a source, so take it FWIW. Also, several of these empires were around for 500+ years, unlike America, right there around 225 or so. I picked time frames that  *I* thought were pre ""dominant empire"" since the OP stated ""been built on...""

It was very tragic the state of affairs in Ireland where even tipping a waitress was a shockingly positive event. 

The general disconnect, I *think* exists, is that the EU nations (and others) have had a very long history with certain ""permissions"" being given to their citizenry. The cultures build with many neighbors knocking on their door. Let me pause there to flip over to the other side of the pond. Much of the US builds up an individual as a sovereign man. So long as he does not breech the property of his neighbor he is free to do as he wishes. So if he wants, he can dig a moat, paint his house plaid and sleep through the day. If he decides to play music at 1AM at maximum volume, that carries over to his neighbor's domain and thus a violation. So there the border exists. 

People in Europe have had to grow up living next door to one another and in response are likely to have (I can't prove it, so it's speculation) developed social norms of compromise lest they have a fight break out. (WW1 was fun that way). Certain things must be sacrificed for peace between neighbors.

So the ideal case of the US citizen permits him to do pretty much anything he wants within his own land's boundary while a person of the EU has to play a bit role in a larger show. 

Now in the US, you start having people who are exceeding their bounds. A particular person doesn't like something and pushes their will against others and we'll run with smoking because its easy. Second hand smoke drifts off into some other person's space - the smoker is violating their boundary. A law gets passed to assert that its a dick thing to do and they then have to lock it away within their homes. Fine by me. Then you have the same person that was justifiably offended pressing the matter on as a health concern - pushing for law that now breaks into the boundary of the person; here is where the ""threat"" of socialism enters. In the US, we'll get a particularly nasty flavor of Socialism (ideas are always going to be tainted with a culture's interpretation of expression) where laws will remove more and more of what a person can and cannot do as a function of the consequences involved with funding the systems that are created. 

A person who starts off with the ability to smoke his cigar on his property, so long as it does not affect others is then told he has to pay for something to benefit him and those around him. If he does not pay, his property is taken and he's jailed. So it's a do-or-die extreme that he reluctantly participates in. Then because of others like him, the costs involved with the system which we was thrust into go up. Cancer is a bitch it seems. So now the law extends its reach not only to his pocket book but now to a past time - healthy or not. 

The person from a country which has a tradition of exchange between neighbors for the social good can't really ""get this"" because they're used to it. 

I'm sorry this is so long-winded, but I think I might have expressed the issue properly. The short form is that with the US, the core of a person's freedoms are enshrined in his property. For socialism to work, the government must invade that property and consume it or else it has no power. (So if Health-care was opt-in you would have a huge imbalance).

1426203172,0,t3_ax4b1,,t1_c0jvwv1,,"My honest opinion:

Christianity is simply one religion among many religions. There are so many religions today. There were many more in old times, which are not respected at all any more, and if you mention them (like Zeus, for example) people will laugh at the idea that they could ever be compared to supposedly deeper religions of today, like Christianity. But once they mattered to people every bit as much, and you can read it in the classics.

Religions rise and fall on their political associations, and they often have political content. Jesus got some of his appeal from opposition to Roman occupation; the Romans persecuted the Christians on a fundamentally political basis, driving Christianity's political success for a little while. Until Constantine (who killed his own relations horribly, and should never be spoken of as a good person) made Christianity the state religion and tore up Roman temples for patently political reasons. In Western Europe Christianity largely spread by Chieftains who were making similar political decisions, and by forcible conversions. Similar trends continued in South America. 

By the time we get to the official founding of the US, enlightenment thinking (cf. Voltaire's Candide) has established itself pretty well, and has a great deal of appeal to 13 religiously diverse colonies who see advantage in some form of association. And this a huge part of how the modern era of the West was formed, and things aren't all the same now in most of the west. But religion is still massively political, with the Republican party courting the ""religious vote"" (really encapsulating a collection of more-cultural-than-Biblical ideas, many of which are strongly political) - and the same blocs scratching Republican backs with official voting guides and so on. Guess what, they are publicly advocating for a theocracy. Well, what else is new? Religion is political. For all the spiritual posturing of religious people, the collections of beliefs which people get together to teach and reinforce direct violent force and the distribution of resources all the time. That is why Marx even cared about it (and he made his own religion, too).

If all this sounds decisively worldly, it is. What does it have to do with Yahweh? Well, who knows - what does it have to do with Apollo or Astarte, either?

So I believe about the contemporary church in any place. It is a worldly organization, it is people talking to each other, it is in some measure political, it can be used for good or evil and it can turn from one to the other quickly, it is no better than human beings are.

Everyone has something they want me to believe. But I'm not shopping around for something to believe. Believing isn't even something one can choose to do voluntarily; it's not like flexing a muscle. 

It was the Jews who set the rules which would have to be fulfilled to name someone the Mashiach. Since then, the church has come up with its own entirely different concept of the Messiah, which is plainly not at all fungible with the idea of the Jewish Mashiach, which I think any intellectually fearless and intellectually honest person (religious or not) can see that Jesus was NOT proven to be. Prophets and Messiahs are a dime a dozen historically. (Street of prophets in the Life of Brian.)

As for proving that Jesus was God, I feel that the case is worse. There is no contemporary evidence whatsoever; all the evidence for this is to come from the Bible. I have no particular problem with the Bible, but I have a large problem with judging its reliability by any means except by evaluating individual claims on their own light. I cannot see that any other approach would be really careful and honest, as we should all be with the truth. No amount of social pressure or supernatural threat will cause me to be any less careful, I look at the evidence. So let's get down to this: there is a canon of texts cobbled together by politicians a few hundred years after the death of Jesus, after Paul (even the synoptic gospels don't start until well after Jesus is dead and the movement has changed radically)... not all Christians have ever agreed on which texts, and certainly they have never agreed on how to interpret them, they differ fundamentally on almost every interpretive question even WITHOUT getting into the interpretations of say Jews or Muslims... all these texts in their languages have been translated by people with various political interests... new fragments are always being found and occasionally they are taken to indicate that whole beloved passages were forged...  I am supposed to take it that every single thing this book says on any topic is absolutely authoritative, without further evidence, and *on that basis alone* I am supposed to take it that this man said he was God. Which isn't even all that plain when I read it myself. It is only said plainly by later authors in the New Testament, and there is absolutely no unequivocal or even very suggestive mention of Jesus being God in any of the Torah. It doesn't work. It's not an argument that Jesus is God, or for any of the rest of these claims which are demonstratedly solely by appealing to the authority of the Bible. Nor, of course, would it make any sense to circularly take the Bible's say-so as proof of the Bible's authority. 

This is without needing to maintain anything about whether the Bible contradicts itself or is immoral, which arguments I leave to others. I treat the Bible by the same standard as all the thousands of scriptures people have regularly devised, from the Vedas and the Avesta down to the writings of Ellen G. White, or Osama Bin Laden, or L. Ron Hubbard. If you want to prove something, you have to prove it. But I am happy to take anything good or true in any book, because good and true are the standards to learn from, and no book or person can be merely *defined* as only producing good or true.

Now, in addition to this I have some deeper objections with the usual doctrines taken to be necessary in Christianity. I find it deeply objectionable and basically idolatrous to say that any human being is God. I can never abide the contemporary Christian idea that there is anything greater in value than what is good. And what is good can never be so simply because some cosmic strong-arm wields incentives or punishments, it is always and forever the same as itself and independent of all people. I can't accept that any voluntary agent with a mind remotely of the same image of a man could be good and also fully in control of all the natural disasters which affect all the innocent beings, it does not make any sense to me.

Even if I were ""on the market,"" shopping for some religious identity to give myself and provide me with my cultural politics, I could still never accept a religion which said that a certain historical man was God, and that man created everything, and that everyone has to believe x, y and z about him or be tortured eternally (as if that were a reasonable punishment for not self-deceiving, or as if it were a proportional punishment for anything at all save torturing others eternally). So I am not up for grabs as a potential convert to fly a flag for your community, whatever it is. Though I've changed my mind and realized things many times, I have never had any sort of conversion experience, don't put stock in them and don't plan one.

But if you have something true to say or if you are participating in the good then I think you are relating to the rest of us as a brother or a sister in a universal and totally limitless brotherhood, and what is there for me to complain about as far as that?

The poor ""ghetto"" area I grew up in (Oakland, CA notorious for very high capita/murder) was a direct effect of government trying to ""help"". I'm not very out of touch of reality. No, they teach you how to be an obedient worker in high school and that the government is the greatest thing ever (mainly due to statist control of the public schooling system). When in fact, the government creates the problem

Ah, the old ""Go live in Somalia"" rhetoric favored by statists. First of all, I'm not an anarchist. Second of all, I think the role of government should be constrained to protecting individuals from aggression and that it may only act to preserve property rights and individual liberty. I could give you dozens of links as to why Somalia isn't anarchy but that won't convince you. I'll give you a link that provides some statistics. [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/8ieq0/someone_posted_this_video_somalia_libertarian/c09dpp6)

I don't want to eliminate my government because it's unrealistic and unpragmatic. I want to drastically down size my government.

That's the entire point. The complexity of human behavior is too difficult to control or mathematically model it. It ignores human action and motivation.

I love how every statist tries to convince me I don't know what is best for me and I'm just brain washed by a company. I don't watch T.V. I run ad blocker. 

&gt;They spend billions of dollars a year making us think about the world in a particular way

Sounds like the government. At least a company can't force me to buy their product, or give them money with no return.

&gt;So even when trying to boycott a large corporation you will likely fail because of the diversity of products a given company might sell/profit from.

Sounds like they have a good business plan then.

&gt;Thus government. The idea is that a group of people can come together and accomplish things that no individual could. 

USSR ended up great, just think how much the collective could accomplish...

&gt;Who cares what a bunch of men said about government more than two hundred years ago. More importantly, who cares about an interpretation of what they said two hundred years ago. An interpretation that says these guys believed that the only point of government (period) is to protect property rights and individual liberties. An interpretation that is frankly, probably wrong.

I do. Sorry, you can't invalidate a set of ideas based on how old they are. Also, the constitution gives the government much more power than to protect property rights and individual liberties. On which basis do you call this wrong? An irrational burst of emotions? If you want to use force or coerce anybody into doing something I have the moral high ground, period.

&gt;With you libertarians it's like witnessing the birth of a new religion with the American constitution as a bible

I don't support a lot of things in the constitution, but it is the supreme law of the land and the most important document in our nation's history. If you don't know the huge difference between a fictional supernatural religious text and a document that clearly defines the role of the government then you obviously cannot think properly. What do I need the government for? If I don't want to receive their services I should be able to opt out of them. The government is a catastrophic failure in the U.S. all our social programs far outweigh our ridiculously expensive military and are merely unfunded liabilities so far in red tape they'll have to print money to pay for them.

What about every time I don't get to use a government service I pay for? You clearly don't realize my issue and I don't think you will. You don't know how to read the fine print. All the services you provided could be done by private organizations just as well if not better, they'd just be paid according to which services I used. 

I have. I was born in Western Germany on a U.S. military base. I've been to all of Europe, I lived in Russia for 2 years. I've been to Japan. What is your point? Are you trying to justify your position based upon the popularity of your idea?

Actually, Britain just started using the word ""concentration"" for it.  The idea of concentration-camps go back pretty far -- The Romans ran camps for internment of Carthaginians, as well as Gaulic and Germanic tribes that in modern terms would be called Concentration-Camps.  I'm sure the Greeks, Persians, Indians, Chinese, Babylonians and Egyptians were doing similar things as well.  

There are no new things under the sun.  

&gt;The Mongols, famously, were all about the slaughtering and the raping and the heads on spikes.

For somebody who claims to understand nuance, that is very much an un-nuanced way of looking at it.  The world they lived in was much more violent and about the raping and the killing than the modern world.   In 12-14th century every nation and political group around the world -- including the Chinese Empires (there were three big ones at the time)...Well, all the Empires, Nations, City States -- were all about killing and, in modern terms, barbaric.

The Mongols, one can claim, did some things that were very important.   They put China in touch with Persia, India, Egypt, and Europe.  Everybody in the Old World (save sub-Saharan Africa) knew about each other on more than a rumor-level because the Mongol empire was so large (including China, Korea, Persia, Iraq, Northern India, Central Asia, future Russia, and even parts of Poland and Hungry, etc.)  So, everybody knew for the first time in history that the Chinese, and others, had good stuff to trade for.  At other points in the past there were trade contacts, but the Mongols brought it into the open big-time. 

Much of that trade lead to the Europeans starting to read old texts of Roman and Greek writers again.  Texts that they got mostly from the Byzantine Empire, but also from Arab and Catholic Monastic sources.   And that contributed to the Renaissance.  

Then the Mongol Empire Collapsed, trade networks broke down and Europe couldn't get stuff from China or India as easily as before.  And then the Ottomans stepped in and really clamped down and turned off European trade with those beyond the Ottoman lands.   So, the Europeans had to look for another route to East Asia and India.  And that lead to the Portuguese and Spanish sailing south and east.   

And that way lead the Modern World.  ",False,1,,True,davidreiss666,True,1265163616,0,1,t5_6,t1_c0jvbmq,c0jvy95,reddit.com,0

First there was Christianity.
Then came more organized Christianity shortly after. St. Augustine suggested it be called ""catholic"", meaning universal.

Several ""heretics"" tried to make their own flavors of Christianity. They were killed.

Next, the orthodox (In Eastern Europe) decided that the pope didn't have authority of the church on Earth, and that it was only God with any authority over the church like that. Essentially Catholic, minus the pope. This was called the first schism from the church.

The catholic church became tyrannical, many people died, and people who didn't know Latin were officially left out of the loop.

Then, Martin Luther decided that everyone was worshiping wrong, and that the only true means of revelation was the bible (catholics also believe tradition is also a means that God reveals things). To prove his points, he removed several books in the bible that went against his beliefs, and started Lutheranism.

After Martin did his thing, everyone decided everyone else was worshiping wrong (and some people wanted divorces). They all started with Martin Luther's formula, and continued creating new branches, all with some personal flavor. They were called protestants.

The Catholic church responded by holding the council of Trent, where they decided everyone has to die. Unfortunately, not everyone did. So these branches continued to live.

Arguments started, and the protestant branches split some more. Protestantism doesn't have a central authority to answer to, so anyone who wants to, with any number of people to follow can start their own branch.

3. No preference. I was carefree. 

4. From sixteen to seventeen I was curious about opiates. Now I'm curious about psychedelics. 

5. Use: MDMA, LSA, alcohol, caffeine, painkillers when I get migraines, marijuana very infrequently.   Not fond of: ""hard"" drugs like heroin and cocaine, ketamine, recreational painkillers, and most hard alcohol. 

6. Generally at night in a social setting, rarely before dusk otherwise. This is primarily on the weekends.

7. I prefer a social setting with extroverted, intelligent people I can trust. 

8. Funerals, when performing a C-section, flying a helicopter, flying a space shuttle, disarming high explosives, being away from any source of clean drinking water (dehydration), and when meeting with foreign diplomats in an effort to prevent total nuclear war between the US and Russia. 

9. I turn off anything that could be used to say stupid things (save for the computer when drinking, as it's fun as hell to have conversations with other drunk people). 

10. My anti-anti drug is MDMA. I love it when listening to music, preferably on surround sound, and in a setting that allows for dancing.

This may seem overly pedantic, but so be it.  In fact, *all* languages evolve and English is far from special in that regard.  What English does have going for it is that for a variety of reasons (having to do with geography, I would argue, more than anything else) it is, by European standards an exceptionally bastardized language; it is technically a Germanic language, but it's definitely the ""red-headed step-child"" of the Germanic family (Afrikaans and Yiddish are also kind of weird, but for different reasons).  For one, English uses word-orders and progressive tenses in a way that it almost certainly borrowed from its Celtic neighbors since they don't occur anywhere else in the Indo-European languages --certainly not in any other Germanic language-- and for another, somewhere between Old and Middle English, it got stripped of a lot of case indicators and gender that still exist in any respectable Germanic language.  Then, to complicate matters, English was also invaded with a great pile of Latin-based words through the Normans who were speaking a bastardized (Viking; basically stripped-down) version of French.  

So, in a nutshell, English is basically a Germanic language that has lost a lot of its Germanic grammar, that uses weird Celtic constructions and progressive tenses, that has a bunch of Latin inherited from Vikings who spoke shitty French, that for the last few hundred years, courtesy of The Royal Society, has become the language of science, and that in the last 200 years has absorbed an insane amount of new vocabulary as a consequence of the fact of the British Empire being one of the largest imperial concerns in history.

The Neanderthals were nothing like the Nazis. The Neanderthals were empathetic and buried their dead in beautiful ceremonies. They loved music and might have created the world's first flute, which modern humans then inherited and took from them. 

The Neanderthals would have kicked the @ss out of any Nazi attempting to round them up. Even the weaker and fairer sex: female Neanderthals, could have given the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger a fight for his life. The females would have outrun our fastest male runners... with powerful lungs and body-frame, and vastly longer strides.

One anthropologist I heard on VPN radio, pointed out that modern humans settled Australia, before they settled Europe. The reason? Because Neanderthals kicked our @ss, and blocked our entry into Europe, and told us to get back to Africa! 

That anthropologist argued that it was only after the ice-age wiped out and softened the Neanderthals, that modern humans were able to move into Europe. 

So I don't see your point in comparing Neanderthals to Nazis. Neanderthals were more passionate, and compassionate, and respected their dead and loved ones, and they kept us from ravaging Europe and the world.

I would consider this to be markedly superior to any of the current systems, which is why I'm a fan of unschooling.  Want to make a kid stupid?  Send 'im to school.

&gt; Yes, but its also been suggested that children who grow up in the west are likely to have a delayed maturity because 'childhood' (i.e. a state of no responsibility) has been extended all the way to the end of college.

Neil Postman ascribes it to the growing complexity of modern society.

Back in the hunter-gatherer era, you could be a functioning adult at 7.  Basically, you just had to know whose toes not to step on, how to ask what things are good to eat and which aren't,  and so forth.  Fluency in the spoken language approaches fluency in the culture.

In the early literate civilizations, well, things were a little more complicated.  You had the Bible, the Vedas, the Five Classics, or whatever else your society produced.  You had mathematics, however rudimentary.  Fluency in the culture demanded some forms of literacy.  These things required more active learning, even a sort of prescribed curriculum (however simple, such as religious education or on-the-job training).  You might be considered an adult at the age of 13 or so, where you can read from the holy texts at a particular ceremony.

The classical civilizations raised the bar a little bit more.  There was more differentiation of profession -- you could be a merchant (not easy), a warrior (not easy), a philosopher (not easy), a teacher, a politician, and on and on and on.  You had to be at least mildly acquainted with each of several schools of thought simply to function in society; to actually be a professional required years of work, either as an apprentice, an assistant, a student, or something else similar.  The age of adulthood crept up a little further.

In the medieval times in Europe, after literacy receded, we also saw a regression in the standards for adulthood.  It did not go back quite so far as it was in the hunter-gatherer times, but it was not quite as high as it was in the early literate cultures.  You might be considered an adult at ten or so, when you had grasped the general arrangement of society, some limited amount of Scripture that you could learn (given that you heard it in Latin), and so on.  Ephebophiles would find this to be a happy time.

As the literacy of the general populace rose (not only in reading and writing but in math, science, and so forth), the age at which one was considered an adult continued to advance.

It's still advancing today.  You can be thirty and barely an adult.  I don't see this as a result of ""coddling"" children, but as a result of the high degree of specialization (and the years of work required to obtain that specialized training) now common in our societies.  We expect much the same things from children of a certain age that we always have -- that they be able to consider others' feelings and property by the time they're eight or so (the social aspects of society), that they display some awareness of how society works by the time they're about ten, and so on.

Although the average age of marriage has varied over time, it has not varied as widely as we might think.  In ancient Greece, men tended to marry in their twenties or early thirties.  In the middle ages, men tended to marry in their twenties or early thirties.  Today, men tend to marry in their twenties or early thirties.  Women tend to marry younger (much younger, when allowed by society), although there are some, ah, patriarchal and sexual reasons for that.  What I take from this is that despite the changing concepts of the age at which adulthood comes, the reasons that compel us to have relationships persist at certain biological ages.  Most people do not have consensual sex before they hit puberty.  Most pubertal sexual experiences, in man, apes, mammals, cuttlefish, and sexual creatures in general, tend to be fumbling, awkward, and ultimately unsuccessful.  I think it's unrealistic to assume that in 2795 B.C.E., there was a magical time where all the women were blushing virgins and all the men were Lotharios.

Given these ideas, I don't believe that the average adult today is more or less mature than a hundred years ago, or a thousand, or ten thousand.  Differently skilled, dealing with different issues, and with different concepts of their aims in life.  I'd say the same for children... I don't think that learning about mathematics is all that different from learning how to kill a rabbit from fifty paces.  I expect the children of cavemen were whiny, self-absorbed little brats too, and that their parents suffered greatly.

- John Adams (1735-1826; 2nd President of the United States)
---------------------------

&gt; ""It is my opinion that if the liberties of this country – the United States of America – are destroyed, it will be by the subtlety of the Roman Catholic Jesuit priests, for they are the most crafty, dangerous enemies to civil and religious liberty. They have instigated MOST of the wars of Europe.""


- Marquis de LaFayette (1757-1834; French statesman and general. He served in the American Continental Army under the command of General George Washington during the American Revolutionary War.)
---------------------------

&gt; ""The war [i.e., the American Civil War of 1861-1865] would never have been possible without the sinister influence of the Jesuits.""


- Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865; 16th President of the United States)
---------------------------

&gt; ""The Jesuits are a MILITARY organization, not a religious order. Their chief is a general of an army, not the mere father abbot of a monastery. And the aim of this organization is power – power in its most despotic exercise – absolute power, universal power, power to control the world by the volition of a single man [i.e., the Black Pope, the Superior General of the Jesuits]. Jesuitism is the most absolute of despotisms [sic] – and at the same time the greatest and most enormous of abuses…""


- Napoleon I (i.e., Napoleon Bonaparte; 1769-1821; emperor of the French)
---------------------------

&gt; ""Between 1555 and 1931 the Society of Jesus [i.e., the Jesuit Order] was expelled from at least 83 countries, city states and cities, for engaging in political intrigue and subversion plots against the welfare of the State, according to the records of a Jesuit priest of repute [Thomas J. Campbell]. …Practically every instance of expulsion was for political intrigue, political infiltration, political subversion, and inciting to political insurrection."" (1987)


- J.E.C. Shepherd (Canadian historian)

The Nazi regime was controlled by the Jesuits. Hitler came from a Roman Catholic family and praised the Jesuits in Mein Kampf. Hitler was brought to power by Franz von Papen, a Knight of Malta. Himmler (Head of Hitler's SS) was a Knight of Malta. Goebbels (Head of Hitler's Propaganda Ministry) was trained at a Jesuit college. Gehlen (Hitler's Intelligence Chief) was a Knight of Malta. Hitler's allies were almost exclusively Roman Catholic. They included Franco, who had many Opus Dei members in his government and who kissed the Pope's hand, and Mussolini, a Knight of Malta who was advised by a Jesuit priest. Another of his allies, Tiso, was a Roman Catholic Priest. Hitler's financiers (Abs and Thyssen) were Knights of Malta. Hitler said ""Above all I have learned from the Jesuits. And so did Lenin too, as far as I recall. The world has never known anything quite so splendid as the hierarchical structure of the Catholic Church. There were quite a few things I simply appropriated from the Jesuits for the Use of the [Nazi] Party."" he also said ""In [Heinrich] Himmler [who would become head of the Nazi SS] I see our Ignatius de Loyola [Founder of the Jesuits and the first 'Black Pope']"".


Fidel Castro, the Communist Dictator of Cuba, is an undercover Jesuit. He attended three Jesuit schools and went on to graduate from a Jesuit 'preparatory' university (Where his brother, Raul, also attended). From here, he went to law school. After graduating from law school, he joined the Christian Democrat Party, which was actually a Roman Catholic party that was founded under Pope Pius in the 1920s. Cuba is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic now, and Roman Catholics are allowed to join the 'atheist' Communist party. Alberto Rivera, the former Jesuit priest who came public (now dead), said that Castro is a 4th degree, professed Jesuit.


Communism was created by the Jesuits. Karl Marx was trained by Jesuits for nearly 30 years at the British Museum. Vladmir Lenin was trained by Jesuits in Geneva, Switzerland. Joseph Stalin was educated by Jesuit monks at Tiflis Seminary in Georgia. Mao Se Tung was Jesuit-trained and put into power by a Jesuit priest.

The Jesuits control the US Military. The head of the Defense Department, Robert Gates, was Jesuit-trained at Georgetown University, as was his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld. Peter Pace, the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was Jesuit-trained at Georgetown University. The current Chair and Vice Chair of the Joint Chiefs are both Roman Catholic. David Petraeus and George W. Casey, Jr., the generals who commanded US forces in Iraq, were both Jesuit-trained at Georgetown University.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is a Jesuit operation. The first director was Tom Ridge, a devoutly Roman Catholic Knight of Columbus. The real power behind the DHS was John C. Gannon, the head of it's intelligence unit. Gannon was Jesuit-trained at the College of the Holy Cross and is a member of the Jesuit Volunteer Corps. The deputy director of the DHS from 2005-2007 was Michael P. Jackson, who was Jesuit-trained at Georgetown University. Bush's first pick for the second DHS director was a Roman Catholic man. In the end, he chose Michael Chertoff, who is married to a Jesuit professor (Meryl Chertoff). Under Chertoff, the head of the DHS' immigration was Emilio T. Gonzalez, a Knight of Malta. The new DHS director (Under Obama) is Janet Napolitano, who was Jesuit-trained at Santa Clara University.


 The PATRIOT Act was written by Viet Dinh, a Roman Catholic professor at Georgetown University, the Jesuit University of Washington DC.


The current head of the CIA was Jesuit-trained at Santa Clara University. The current head of the DOD was Jesuit-trained at Georgetown University. The current head of the DHS was Jesuit-trained at Santa Clara University. The current head of the ATF was Jesuit-trained at Boston College High School.


Blackwater (Changing it's name to 'Xe') was founded by Erik Prince, a devout Roman Catholic. It's Chief of Operations (until recently), Joseph E. Schmitz, who previously worked for the Pentagon as the former Inspector General of the Department of Defense is a Knight of Malta an Opus Dei and Jesuit trained at Georgetown Preparatory School and Georgetown University and was also a Professor there. Author Jeremy Scahill linked the Knights of Malta directly to Blackwater. Blackwaters founder, Erik Prince is also a Knight of Malta and has recently been implicated in the murder of individuals who were cooperating with federal authorities investigating the company. A former employee also alleges that Prince ""views himself as a Christian crusader tasked with eliminating Muslims and the Islamic faith from the globe,"" and that Prince's companies ""encouraged and rewarded the destruction of Iraqi life.""


 At the center of the Iran-Contra scandal were Ronald Reagan, George H.W Bush, William J. Casey, Robert Gates, Oliver North, and Alexander Haig. All of them, with the exception of Robert Gates (who himself was Jesuit-trained) were Knights of Malta. Casey and Haig were Jesuit-trained, as well, and Haig's brother, Francis, was a Jesuit priest.

One thing you could do in computer science would be to write a Genetic Algorithm, every day, as quickly as possible.  At night, right before resetting, you could memorize the DNA of the best organism, and seed the following day with it.  I'm not sure what problem you could meaningfully solve, but this would be a way to do it.

If something like Amazon EC2 existed, you could leverage a really amazingly large amount of computation.  Another thing you could do would be to decrypt anything - search through keyspace sequentially, and each night memorize the last key you used, and each morning start from there.  Eventually, you'd break anything breakable - factor any prime, etc.  Also, you could *eventually* guess any password.  Actually, you probably wouldn't need to search sequentially - you could just use a physical random number generator to seed you.

Um - back to the fun stuff...  I would certainly watch every movie at every video store I could get to.  Listen to every song I possibly could.

I might experiment with surviving terrible injuries - cause massive physical harm to myself, and try to learn how I could best survive them on my own.  Granted, I'd only learn ""surviving the first 24 hours,"" but that'd still be impressive.

So he unfolds a piece of paper from his pocket, puts it down on his lap and reads it for instructions on how to give a back message.  This was some mix of hilarious, sad and creepy. We referred to the guy afterwards as ""premeditated backrub man"".

At the time I was getting fiddle lessons from a woman who shared a house with several students.  PBM used to hang out there with them sometimes.  Then one of her housemates told me they banned him from coming over, after he admitted to them that he went through their garbage and could tell when she was having her menstrual cycle, showing them a little calendar he kept. He timed his visits to her different parts of her cycle. 

Ew.

Eventually I realised that the friend I knew PBM from was also a creep.  The guy came out of the closet (no problem there, we suspected....) and became more sexually active (again, no problem).  But it was the more-explicit-blow-by-blow accounts that he relished describing to us, even when we said we didn't need the details.

But worse: friend-of-PBM would meet somebody at a party or bar, and tell us how he had a crush on some guy, and write 20 page sexually explicit love letters to the guy, and read copies of them to us.

Friend-of-PBM became a nudist. He'd walk around his house naked all of the time. He would visit your house, when your parents were over, and decide to strip naked. Then maybe decide to go outside to your backyard and start fiddling himself in the rain.

Friend-of-PBM also had this habit of tackling people he had a crush on. He'd run up to them, give them a bear hug and knock them over. Extra awkward when he was naked. Or just met the guy 10 minutes ago.

One time I'm sitting in a cafe with a close girlfriend, and she breaks out into tears and tells me a story about this guy who drugged and raped her on a date. Then who shows up, and invites themselves to sit at our table, oblivious that we are having a personal and intense conversation, but Friend-of-PBM, with PBM, and a third guy, who happens to be the date rapist.

This is cathartic, but if I go on further, you might want literary eye bleach.

Needless to say, Friend-of-PBM was quickly dropped from our circle of friends. One of my friends (the one who had the unfortunate fiddly visit above) made up a whole story of moving to Europe, and whenever he ran into the guy in the street, happened to mention he was home visiting his folks, who moved to another house anyway, etc.

Creepy people don't seem understand social mores. It's one thing to violate social boundaries (everybody does it to a degree), but they don't seem to understand that these boundaries and expectations on behaviour exist at all.
I consider it a kind of mental illness.

I also learned the hard way that creeps tend to hang out with each other, and because of their lack of social boundaries, tend to hang out with groups of young non-conformist types (punks, hippies, etc., in their 20s), who are  ""inexperienced"" and so tolerate their creepiness for a time.

I also learned the hard way that if you hang out with creeps, people think you're a creep.

However his ""facts"" about what happens when you mix races and how it harms the mixed offspring is false. His two examples of sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis are iffy. Both of these diseases are recessive, that means  you have to get a mutated version from BOTH your parents. Africans do not have the cystic fibrosis gene and Europeans do not have the sickle cell anemia gene (well if you want to get technical some souther Europeans do); so if both parents carried their races ""mutant gene"" there is no way their child would have either disease because it is autosomal recessive.

And if you really want to know about how great it is to keep things ""pure"" and separate out the races ask the Ashkenazi Jews about Tay-Sachs disease. It too is autosomal recessive but because they kept things ""pure"".... really gave them an advantage. Fortunately for them today they have genetic testing and prenatal testing that prevents the birth of these children. It really is a horrible way to die and they do die, nothing you can do about it; even with the best of care the kids don't live much past five.

So that is how the guy is trolling, I agreed with him until he started talking about keeping the races ""pure"" and categorizing them as different species.

Using the EU poverty line set at 60% of median income, the findings reveal that in 2007 almost 16 out of every 100 people in Ireland were at risk of poverty. The 2008 edition of the CSO’s Statistical Yearbook indicates that out of approximately 1,050,000 children in Ireland aged less than 18 years, 19% are classified as being at risk of poverty. This amounts to approximately 200,000 children. More than half of all those at risk of poverty in Ireland today (55.9%) live in households headed by a person who is outside the labour force (i.e. people who are older or ill, or have a serious disability or are in caring roles). These are Ireland's most vulnerable people and they depend completely on social welfare payments for survival. There was an increase in the ‘at risk of poverty’ rate for older people. The rate rose from 13.6% in 2006 to 16.6% in 2007 (Source: EU-SILC survey, 2007).

This is such complete speculative conjecture and bullshit, I just have to step in and respond.

Do a little bit of *research* on the history of the FDA.  If the 'free market' was so great at creating organizations to solve problems like these ... then *why* didn't the free market step in and develop an independent safety rating agency before the [Elixir sulfanilamide poisonings of 1937](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_sulfanilamide)?  This was *not* the first time something like this happened ... food and medicine poisonings happened in our country for a very long time before 1937 -- but somehow the free market did *not* step in to magically solve the problem.  So the government did.

Perhaps a good thing -- as in the 50's-60's, a German company was pushing a new drug *hard* trying to get it into the US market.  The FDA agent reviewing it was reluctant to approve it.  As a result, the United States avoided the [Thalidomide posionings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide#Birth_defects) that left thousands of babies deformed all across Europe.

It's fallacious to assume because maybe the FDA isn't perfect in every thing it does, every single time - that therefore it has never served any benefit nor protected anyone.

Don't blame the population for wanting the government to step in and protect them against the worst of corporate excesses ... blame the 'free market' for not reacting quickly enough to resolve the problems before the government steps in.  

In the case of Underwriters' Laboratories (the favorite Libertarian example) - the market came in early and provided a solution.  That's great.  As long as they are never tainted, I have no issues with them as a private entity, providing that function.  But, as we saw during the financial implosion last year, even supposed ""neutral"" Wall Street credit rating agencies were slapping AAA ratings on packages of shit.

My point is simple and direct: There are more than one or two sides to these issues.  And even attempting to boil them down into a 2-sided debate is not just disingenuous, but stupid.  

&gt;You then respond pointing out that those empires were products of less enlightened, more violent times, which - as we like to think of ourselves as more civilized now - is a clear argument why America's behavior is often unacceptable even compared to historical empires.

More than just wrong.  Willfully wrong.  The United States is the current major power of the day.  And major powers, weather you are willing to understand it or not, are not normal average players on the political stage.   Lots of nations like to use Propaganda and say ""We aren't like that"" when they damn well know that the major power of the day is acting that way ON THEIR BEHALF.  

Example: The Iraq War.   Some people say that the Iraq war is about Oil, but refuse to understand who's buys the Iraqi oil.  Iraqi oil goes to Europe, India and China.  It does not come to the Untied States.  

That war.... weather Europeans want to acknowledge it in public or not, was primarily about European Oil rights in the Middle East.  European Oil rights that are being protected by the United States on their behalf.  

It is not about American oil rights in the Middle East.  American Oil from the Middle East comes primarily from Saudi Arabian ports on the Red Sea.  

In short, it is about protecting the economy of the EU and the major emerging economies of India and China.  Bush was an inept player at the game of International Power Politics.  He thought he could snap his boots and people would fall into line.  He didn't understand it was much more about holding hands and convincing people that it was their own idea all along.  

And yes, Protecting the European, Indian and Chinese economies is in the interest of Americans.   The world economy is way too intertwined.  The US can't have a go economy is Europe sucks, and vice versa.  Same goes for China and India.  One part of the world suffers, and we all suffer in the modern world.  

The Iraq war is still stupid.  It's outright unwinnable unless we kill every single Iraqi.   And we can't and shouldn't do that.  But it's not a simple issue.

- Do not think of work as trading time for money. Think of it as a performing labor for money, and labor takes some of your time. Ideally you want to be working in a job that values your commitment in work over your commitment in time.

- If you want to forge your own path, expect to get harassed.

If you're in a career job and you have a truly creative idea for a project, expect that it will be rejected immediately, then you'll have to revise it and try again.

- Invest your time and energy in new experiences. Young people are tragically unable to see that the things they invest their time in will have a lasting outcome in a few years. A new phone or clothing is only beneficial on a very short time-line. Getting drunk with your friends is fun, but the real experience there is having memories that you forged with your friends. Learn to think in terms of experiences that will have a *lasting* impact. I saved up money to go travel in Europe one summer, and I still think about it to this day. Read widely, get interested in new hobbies and keep growing the list of experiences you have had.

- Don't quit your job out of frustration. If you leave a job, have another one lined up, and make sure the transition to the new job will solve at least ONE of the problems you had with the old job.

As I got closer, I realized one thing: she was damn dirty. So dirty in fact I at first thought she was a hobo. She looked like she had been wearing the clothes she had on for days. Her clothes was covered with dust and even mud. She looked like she sweat a lot and didn't take a shower in days.

I stopped next to her and considered the idea of driving away for a moment. She was simply repulsive. Now, to be clear: she looked VERY cute behind all this dust and dirt and stains on her skin, although a bit thin and small, but even her hair was terribly dirty. I finally decided to take her and uphold what I said to her earlier (give her a lift, host her for a few days, etc). I immediately knew my car would never forgive me. She would without a doubt get my seat and entire car dirty.

She smelled terrible; so bad I discretely opened the window to ""get some fresh air."" I introduced myself to her and she told me who she was in a few words. I wished to myself she did not try to shake my hand. It looked like she did not even wash that.

I drove quite fast and she spoke little. She seemed depressed, maybe a bit sad. As we arrived, the last thing I wanted is her going around and getting my whole apartment dirty, so I immediately said: ""Want to take a shower?"" Boy, was I subtle... She immediately agreed and I took her to the bathroom (thanks God, close to the entrance, each of her step left some mud or whatever on the floor). I told her to put her clothes in a white bin (honestly I felt like simply burning them, I Would have to wash them for an hour with nothing else) and to step in the shower. She looked at me for a few seconds, looking even sadder. For the first time, her eyes were directly plugged into mine, and I could feel everything about her.

I realized I was an idiot, told her I was sorry and prepared to leave the room; obviously, she did not want me there as she was taking a shower. I said: ""Sorry, I'm gonna go..."" I stopped there for a second, thought and said: ""...unless... I don't know, you want me to stay and take a shower with you?"" I said that half-jokingly, with a smile. She kept her serious face, nodded, and took my hand. 

It was incredibly weird at first. We had never met. We had chatted one hour only. She was there, all dirty, inside a stranger's house. I only knew her first name (Julia). And she wanted to take a shower with me. 

But there was a problem. I did not dare to even take her clothes off. She was just too dirty. I removed my shirt in good faith and put it in the white bin. She removed her shirt as well. I removed my socks, and she did too, mirroring me. I removed my pants and watched her remove her; I was getting incredibly horny. There was just something... Something so spontaneous, so great about it. We were both in underwear, and I smiled. I was shy, too. I finally removed my underwear and she did as well. Then we stepped in the shower together and I started the water. All this time she did not say a word. She had a way with gestures, moves...

The water fell on her face, getting rid of some mud or whatever she had on her face. I still did not want to touch her, her body was just so dirty. She had not taken a shower in days, maybe week. Then followed one of the best sexual experiences of my life.

I started to wash her, part by part. It was incredibly rewarding. I started with her face, gently pushing soap. Then I got down, washed her body, her arms and her legs. Some dirt was just too solidly put on her body and I had to use a brush. It must have taken me over an hour. Her hair was particularly something to wash. At the end it was all soft and beautiful. The whole experience was just so great, I feel so excited... It's hard to explain with words.

At the end, she was an extremely beautiful, and attractive woman. And all this time she did not say a word. We started kissing, I led her to my bed, and we had sex. Protected, of course. It was perhaps the best sex in my life. She moved swiftly, never talked, and could go at it for hours. It was terribly good.

She stayed with me for a almost a week. She would shower a few times a day, like she really enjoyed it, like she really enjoyed the hot water on her body, the feeling of being nice and clean, and every time after we would have sex. My electricity bill must had been crazy this month. Then she asked for a ride to the airport, flew away, and I never saw her again.

I never found out exactly why she was so dirty and talked so little. I knew she came from a far, eastern Europe country and loved to travel around the world. I knew she had to take a train, a bus and a plane to get here, which took days, and forced her to sleep at the various stations. I suppose these days, without any place to shower or rest, are the reason she was so dirty. I still dream about this whole experience.

Point of disagreement: You are railing against reality.  Education costs money, and HS grads cannot appreciate the value of money.  They will be exploited by loan agencies, whether they are private or governmental.  

I guess my knee-jerk libertarianism didn't like your opposition to privatization.

You define ""a real slave society is? One where anyone who's not independently wealthy is forced to take on tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt just to be allowed to get a job.""  My perspective is that people have to be responsible for their own choices, and choosing to work at a job that requires a college degree, does in fact, require paying for a college degree.

To go further with this, college is mostly a place where smart people are herded to get older and hopefully more mature.  Most jobs do not require skills that can only be developed in college.  In Europe, for example, productive people in similar jobs are far less likely to have a degree than their US counterparts.  So the degree mostly means that the person who earned it was willing to do so, not that they can actually *do* anything the non-degreed person can't do.

Employers hire college grads because of correlation (smart people go to college).  In fact, employers want to hire smart people, but have very few tools to distinguish them.  Moreover, employment law specifically forbids the use of IQ tests as ""discriminatory.""

In fact, the over-availability of student loans has been tremendously inefficient for society in general, encouraging students to take on unsupportable loans.  It *is* unfair to them that they must do so, yet that is the structure of our society.  Most non-technical learning is done out of a love of learning, and a need for a degree.  The stuff you love to learn you could just as easily have learned at home, on the Internet, or in bookstores.

The ultimate proof of this is that MIT put **all** of their course offerings online, for free.

It took another black guy who was in the room to say, ""No, it's not weird. He's from Canada, it's different up there.""

I'll admit there are a lot of stereotypes that have some level of validity to them. For instance, Asian drivers are oft chastised in my city (Vancouver) for being poor drivers, but usually that's because a lot of them are immigrants that aren't accustomed to our traffic laws.

IMO, being racist isn't a matter of identifying someone of a particular race when you first meet them, but rather assuming that because they are a particular race that they will act in a certain way.

Again, I think it's very different in Canada because people don't really act out how they're expected to by race out here as much. I know plenty of people who are of asian, persian, afghan, jamaican, and european descent who all act exactly the same - like Canadians. There's no ebonics, no difference of language, no difference of career or social stature. It's a pretty level playing ground around here.

The ONE exception around here that I find is with Native Canadians. But even in those cases, just because I've seen so many people of so many different skin tones interact so well on both professional and personal levels, I never really assume that any one person that I meet is going to automatically revert to that persona, until they start acting like they will.

If you're sitting in, say, Berlin, then you are within a few hours of London, Istanbul, Morocco, Reykjavik - and airfare is still reasonable in Europe, and trains are quite comfortable and cheap.

You just can't see such a diversity of cultures anywhere else - and you can fit in.

Going to China, Japan or Korea is a completely different story.  You'll always be a visible foreigner, and these cultures are far more monolithic, particularly since the languages are so impenetrable to a Westerner.

I said that they are not genetically more distant or diverse between Japanese individuals, than they are in relation to Koreans, Chinese, Mongolians, etc. The Japanese are a distinct ethnic group, which makes them somewhat like a large extended family; each Japanese person is more closely related and genetically similar to every other Japanese  person (assuming they're of purer Japanese blood) then they are to people outside their Japanese ethnic group, such as the Koreans. However, if I recall correctly from a Japanese study, the Japanese are more closely related to the Koreans, then they are to Chinese groups such as Manchu and Han. But they are all closely related to each other as you follow their origins; the same is true for European groups, and other groups such as American Indians who originated from a small group in Siberia before branching out into different ethnic groups.

As far as leading studies and theories go in Japan related to their origins, they believe they originated from the mainland (Korea is the likely candidate) and moved into the islands of Japan; there they encountered the indigenous population (believed to be the ancestors of present day Ainu). Overtime they exterminated and mixed with the indigenous population, leaving little or no unmixed Ainu in present day, particularly after the efforts against them in the 19th century and early 20th century. Older experts (e.g. ones prior to discovery of DNA) thought that the Ainu (and their ancestors) may have been related to the Caucasoid group (such as Europeans); more recent studies seem to lead to the theory that they were actually an older Mongoloid/Asian group that became isolated on the Japanese islands, making them somewhat of a proto-Mongoloid/Asian people. If this is true then the Japanese people originating in the mainland mixed with another ethnic group of their race (as far as current results show, but it depends on how far back they were isolated from the others on the mainland). This gives the Japanese more diverse origins as an ethnic group, but they are still more closely related to one another in their ethnic group, then they are to other ethnic groups such as Koreans.

Japanese, Koreans, Mongolians, Tibetans, Han, Manchu and some other groups in Asia are part of the same race.

&gt;Eliminating the sole rival superpower is not in their interest? Hahaha, oh wow.

No, a long and bloody war with mass death and destruction was not in their interests, particularly when the non nuclear military might of both sides made the outcome so uncertain.

&gt;The entire world. If the USSR fell, capitalism would rule, as it does today. If America fell, communism would rule.

Domino theory? Still? Why didn't Communism continue to spread south after the loss of the Vietnam war? Communism was still bound to fail because of the serious structural problems it contained, this is why China has moved towards capitalism without falling.


&gt;Kruschev announced ""We will bury you"" to the U.S. 

You mean he announced ""we will dig you in"" (different meaning, implies outlasting rather than destroying), and later clarified he was talking about the supposed inevitable collapse of Capitalism at the hands of the proletariat?

&gt;He positioned nukes in launching distance of every major city on the East Coast in '62.

Yup, that's MAD, still doesn't show any sign that his aim was the invasion of America (America did the same thing without wishing to invade and conquer Russia). 

&gt;Do you actually believe nukes hit each other in the air and ""cancel out""?

&gt;They use nuclear weapons as a threat to obliterate the invading force's cities. What good is getting a handful of divisions into your enemy's country if your capital and industrial centers are vaporized?

I thought that was perfectly clear, but I'll explain yet again. Under MAD, if I launch nuclear weapons, the other side will also launch nuclear weapons too, and we will both face annihilation. This is an unacceptable outcome for both sides, therefore neither side can launch weapons and this means the nukes of one side 'cancel out' the threat of nukes from the other side. 

If I launch a land war, probably over a small piece of territory, the risk and loss of that war to the other side is far less than the surety of the destruction of all their major cities (hell, even the loss of Western Europe wouldn't have been worse than America's destruction from America's perspective), therefore they cannot with any seriousness threaten to launch their nuclear weapons in response.

Well then you're a fool if you actually believe nuclear weapons have no effect on sovereignty.  Nukes and the MAD doctrine were the primary reasons WW3 could not be waged.

Actually, reality is that the majority of European states offer flat-out *free* education at their state universities.   And in the grand scheme, it's really not that expensive.  The amount of money we'd need to redirect to pay for the education of qualified adults in our country would only be the tinest percentage of our military budget.

In most countries in the world, ""Student loans"" are loans to make it so that students don't have to work while they're going to school.  We're almost alone among the civilized nations in expecting people to put themselves in debt for years for the sake of becoming productive members of society.

&gt;To go further with this, college is mostly a place where smart people are herded to get older and hopefully more mature. Most jobs do not require skills that can only be developed in college. 

&gt;In fact, the over-availability of student loans has been tremendously inefficient for society in general, encouraging students to take on unsupportable loans. It is unfair to them that they must do so, yet that is the structure of our society.

So you seem to agree with me here that this situation is wrong...  but I'm unclear on what you're suggesting we do to fix it.  You're right, in a perfect world, a college degree *isn't* required to be an office drone.  But society currently says it is because, as you say, it's a halfway useful way of distinguishing between smart people.

The problem, then, is it means that schools form a gatekeeping role that, once again, *money* is required to pass through.  Either you have to be independently wealthy, or you have to be willing to enslave yourself to the bank for years.  But this doesn't ACTUALLY prove you're smart - it just proves you can come up with money.  

My solution, as you can surmise, is to make state Universities free for citizens.  Not only would that mean that suddenly money is *no significant barrier at all* to the best and smartest being able to carve out their place in society, but it would create an immediate downward pressure on the prices of the private universities that, frankly, have gotten out of control.

As I said in another reply to someone, because of the importance our society places on college degrees, the demand for education is pretty much inelastic.  Only a radical shift in pricing schemes will be able to provide any sort of reliable change in the accessibility of college.

The hard cold truth, whether you like it or not, is that the international community did not recognize Palestinian arabs' claims for the whole of mandate Palestine. If you do not recognize the legitimacy of this decision (and as your own link states, Arabs in general did recognize the UN's right to decide the fate of Palestine), then I don't see how you can demand protections of international law. If you do, in principle, acknowledge international law, then you have to acknowledge some basic facts about it. Europeans had the privilege of allowing jews to settle in Palestine because they won Palestine in war - that is a fact. A legal right for jewish people to settle in Palestine - including West Bank - exists and is derived from the same authority the League of Nations and then UN held over the Palestine question; this is also a fact. It does mean, exactly as I said, that the jews have a right of settlement anywhere in Palestine.

What it does *not* mean, however, is that jews had any rights to harm or displace arabs. Virtually every legal paper out there that deals with the resolution of conflict between zionists and palestinians explicitly demands that rights of the palestinians be preserved. Your own link mentions that in regard to Jerusalem. We are talking here about social and religious rights - but **not** political rights because, again, the international community did not recognize palestinian political rights. And, if jews had no right to harm the arabs, why exactly did Naqba happen?

And here I would ask you a question, you being (I presume) an authentic palestinian arab who would be able to give a honest answer from what his people believe: how do you think this conflict started? You were most certainly educated about this; I want to know what kind of education they gave you. 

&gt; Also, Israel doesn't have a right to exist

Israel has a right to exist. Some would argue that this is because Israel is the ancient national homeland of the jews. Others would argue that it is because Israel has the capacity of turning you into dust. Opinions aside, fact is that Israel already exists and is not going anywhere. On our side, we are desperate for the conflict to end. We have made countless concessions throughout the years which we hoped will bring us closer to the end of this pointless war, but on every step we were deceived and the result was the opposite of what we sought. As long as the meme that Israel ""doesn't have a right to exist"" persists in your society, the reconciliation is impossible. And since you live not that far from me (how far, really? 100km? That is not far at all), can you honestly look at Israel and at your place and say that if the war goes on forever, Israel will break first?

I talk to many Americans in real life everyday.  I don't think I know a single person who doesn't think that Europe (and the rest of the world) hates us.  My anecdotal evidence is just as meaningless as yours.

Patriotism isn't nationalism.  We do have many nationalists in our country, but you make it sound like patriotism is a bad thing.  I may have just misunderstood you though.

I don't understand your 9/11 comment.  Are you saying that a lot of people don't know 9/11 was on September 11th?  Do you have a source?

The coffee suing case was blown up by the media.  The woman spilled coffee into her lap and received third degree burns on her genitals.  She underwent two years of medical treatment.  She sued because McDonald's kept their coffee 50 degrees (F) hotter than anybody else, which is why it was able to give her third degree burns.  Their argument was that it was grossly unsafe for them to be serving coffee this hot, which is somewhat true.  The case isn't as stupid as it's made out to be.

The US doesn't have a bigger budget than the rest of the world combined, but it is about a third of the total military spending in the world.  The US is 27th in military spending as a percentage of GDP.  Do you have a source for your NASA statistic?  I agree that our military budget is disgustingly large and we need to divert that to universal healthcare, but I'm just trying to clear up the facts.

The message from Israel has been consistent and perfectly clear, they have not wavered or changed positions even once. The message is that the Pals can't have what they want, not by asking, not by paying, not by sanctions, and not by force. Operation cast lead demonstrated that Israel will blast right through human shields to reach its intended targets. Hamas cannot hide behind children any longer lest they too become casualties. Israel is in this to win and will do WHATEVER it takes, and has, and will do so far into the future. Oh sure they will offer a couple soldiers up as patsies, but don't think it would be so different next time the IDF responds to rocket fire from Hamas. Maybe the UBERmoronic Pals should reconsider their strategic position and get realistic? Or they can try to fight some more and experience more IDF wrath. You see, they blew it, and whatever they get in the end if anything will be a mere fraction of what they were offered in 2000. ""Ehud Barak offered Arafat an eventual 91% of the West Bank, and all of the Gaza Strip, with Palestinian control over Eastern Jerusalem as the capital of the new Palestinian state"" They refused. THEY REFUSED and started doing Suicide bombings! So now look at them!! Today, at best they would get well under 91% of the West Bank, and East Jerusalem is not even up for discussion, and never will be again. They had their chance, now they must live as they are until some Islamic republic offers them safe haven as they will find no comfort near Israel. Secondly, Israel is well prepared for any action taken by other nations in support of Palestinians. They are not stupid, they know how Europeans feel, because that is how Israel was created. Israel does not fear the EU, it has good ties with Russia and China, and is in no immediate danger. They can draw this out for decades and they can do so without even flinching, and they will. Pal kids on the other hand have no future whatsoever thanks to Arafat refusing the only good offer they will ever see presented to them. Any responsible Pal parent would do all they could to leave Israel and find a new home in greater Islam. Unfortunately, the rest of Islam does not want them either. Perhaps we should make a new Palestinian state in Europe in the same way in which Israel got formed in the middle East. What's the matter Europe, you don't want Palestinians in your neighborhoods either? If they care so much, where's the offers? Anyhow when they are not hating on Israel or making suicide bombing plans they are busy killing each other. Fuck them, and Fuck you! Seriously! Whatchya gonna Bitch? HUH? What?

Rather in the same way that few whites in the western world are good at separating Koreans from Japanese from Chinese, few East Asians are able to distinguish a French person from say, a Briton.  Those that are aware of the difference often assume that everyone white speaks English.  In China I met Germans who could barely communicate intelligibly in English employed as English teachers -- their only qualification?  White skin.  I also met Chinese-Americans who were bilingual and bicultural who could not get a job despite being (one would think) vastly more qualified because they didn't fit Eastern conceptions of what an English teacher is supposed to look like.

Then there's the other disturbing reality: a sizeable percentage of people who go to teach English in East Asia (Japan/Korea/China) are white guys with Asian fetishes who are in fact motivated by sex.  If you have any Asian friends, you might have heard them say that western conceptions of Asian beauty are very far removed from Asian conceptions of Asian beauty -- a girl who makes it as an Asian model in say, the US will look decidedly different from one who makes it in Asia.  Nothing surprising there -- it's cultural.  In the US and Europe, where Asians are the minority, just being Asian has an exotic appeal, and often that is a big part of what motivates people to describe these models/actresses as ""pretty"".  In Asia everyone is Asian, and things that most westerners don't pay any attention to (like whether your eyes are single or double lidded, or what shape they are, or the height of the bridge of your nose, or whatever) are very important in determining what is attractive.

Simply put, ugly Asian girls (by Asian cultural standards) are often regarded by virtue of their exoticity as attractive.

Well, that works both ways.  Terribly unattractive white men are seen as exotic in the east, and men who had very little chance of ever making it in their home countries suddenly find droves of Asian girls who are more than happy to try it with them.

Now, there's really nothing wrong with this.  When I worked in China, we used to joke about how you'd see an ugly Chinese girl with an ugly white guy, and neither would be aware of the other's unattractiveness from the perspective of his own culture.  That's nice, right?  Ugly people have feelings too.

The problem is the motivation.  A lot of these guys come to Korea or China or whatever expressly to take advantage of this, as it were.  It's like a kind of long-term sex tourism.  They don't really want to teach English, and like I said before, are rarely qualified to do so.  They want to fuck Asian girls, and they do.  Eventually they screw one of their students and get fired, and move on to the next school.

Now, doing this for a year or two when you get out of college might be sort of understandable, why not sow your wild oats, but a lot of these guys are in their mid-30s and totally detached.

&gt;Nukes and the MAD doctrine were the primary reasons WW3 could not be waged

You keep stating this as if it were self evident. I do not take it on faith that the Soviets would have engaged in all out land war were it not for nuclear weapons, and I challenge you to produce something that proves that they would have. 

&gt;And if you really believe nuclear weapons don't ensure sovereignty, why is North Korea and Iran pursuing them? Just to piss us off? No. They want to make sure no one fucks with them, as we proved we would in Afghanistan and Iraq

That's a completely different situation, those two countries are taking advantage of their status as 'rogue nations' or irrational players in international politics to cause fear that they may make a launch regardless of the consequences. The reality is that even if they did make a launch in response to an invasion, the counter attack they would receive would completely overwhelm any benefits or destruction caused by their fairly pitiful nuclear weapons (which may well not even reach their target/s).

&gt;His aim could not be invasion because we had nukes ensuring our independence. Which is my entire point that you seem to be transiently advocating for and against.

I'll clarify what I am arguing. My position is that in the case of superpowers, nuclear weapons are only useful to counter other nuclear weapons (and because it is so hard to know every facet of your enemies nuclear arsenal, you only need to have enough to create the illusion you might have more), they have little effect on land wars and thus do not ensure independence.



&gt;Exactly. Which is why no direct conflict broke out, or will break out, between nuclear powers

What? You just completely ignored my point about nuclear weapons not being an effective deterrent against a land war in a MAD situation, go back and answer it please.

I can make an equivalent comparison by saying that most of the people I encounter on the internet are on 4chan, and that 95% of the people using the internet are homophobic, sexist, racist men who get their kicks spending countless hours on the internet frustrating and infuriating people. Many of them are from the UK by the way. Kind of an unfair study, isn't it?

Next, is the issue of military spending. In the '09 issue of SEED Magazine, there was an interview with Scientist and former Science Advisor to the President,  John Mauberger. Mauberger pointed out in the interview that:

*""About a third of the world’s R&amp;D is performed in North America, nearly all of it in the US. About a third in Europe and about a third in Asia...Many countries pursue science as soft power, but America is unique among nations in this respect. After World War II, the US alone had the remaining economic capacity to develop the opportunities presented by science. Consequently, the world sent its aspiring scientists to us...""*

The US is in a unique position because it has formed a capitalist approach around science. As a result, there is massive incentive for scientific pursuit inside the US that has helped the world on a global level - this has occurred on the corporate level, but also on the government level, as a lot of military spending is in R&amp;D.

As for socialism - I'm not about to enter into a debate about socialism, and its effectiveness. I can say from my own experiences of living in Canada for 23 years that there are many many flaws in Health Care, Education, and Transportation. To state that there are no problems would be complete ignorance. There is no perfect system out there as I see it, and it's a subject I made part of my own University education - studying the differences between Canada's public system and America's private system.

I'll end with one cautionary note that I hope you won't take as insult - but to state that you have no respect for 51% of the US is practicing the same kind of ignorance that you claim to despise in the US. ",False,2,,False,otiose321,True,1265254767,0,2,t5_mouw,t1_c0jy48x,c0jye9g,science,0

Great Powers don't get to the top by sharing, they get there by a ruthless drive to be #1. I'd be interested to hear of a historical example of two great powers who *both* set aside their drive for power and shared their spheres of influence- without first beating the crap out of each other and in stalemate having no alternative but to work together. While in the nuclear age a WW2 style all-out total war may be out of the question, it's naive to rule-out some kind of destructive wasteful conflict between the US &amp; China this century; there aren't enough resources in the world for both of them, one of these two countries is going to get screwed by the other on access to resources, not to mention that China's never getting back the money it sunk into the US, that won't go over well.

This is telling.  If I could give you a piece of advice:  If you're in a home where people pray before meals, bow your head and go along, even if you don't happen to believe in god.  I bet a lot of people call what you are saying ""racist.""  You can most likely avoid this by replacing the word ""race"" with the word ""tribe"" in your speech.  Further, you're making a fundamental mistake when saying traditional concepts of race correspond to actual sub-species of humans.  For example, Colin Powel is ""black,"" but he has no African ancestory to speak of.  By failing to recognize that actually existing notions of race do not correspond to actually existing sub-species, you're coming off as a racist.  

So replace race with the word tribe.  There are three main human tribes, Africans, Europeans and Asians.  There are sub-tribes within each tribe, and some sub-tribes are hybrids.  There are also sub-sub-tribes.  The fact that the actual situation is inconvenient for the lazy diction of lay taxonomy should be expected as this is a scientific issue - people descend from the people they descend from and are in some significant part determined by their ancestors in a typically complex way.  

&gt;The point remains the same, as there are many more inherited weaknesses and illnesses aside from Sickle Cell Anemia.

Advantages are inherited as well, and I would be very surprised if any sufficient body of scientific evidence existed to establish that the disadvantages of cross-tribal adoption outweigh the advantages.  History, for it's part, shows that ancient tribes exchanged members at a limited but appreciable rate.  

&gt;Many of the races are quite distant from each other genetically, particularly Blacks as they were for vast majority of their history stuck in sub-Sahara Africa with little or no contact with other races.  It comes as so surprise that mixing more distant DNA comes with abnormalities, as we see the same thing in other animals; the difference being that humans have not diverged far enough to cause the infertility issue.

absorbing animation and VFX (Visual Effects) content much faster than ever
before. All this prompted us to reformat the existing animation education system.

Screen Studio, Live Action Studio and Sound Studio into the delivery model
makes our students ‘studio-ready’ from the very day they complete their
graduation. We also have a faculty panel from abroad who visits our centres on
regular intervals. We have become the world’s 11th ‘Authorised Training Centre’
for Autodesk’s Smoke and Flame, which is the entertainment industry’s de-facto
standard for high-end compositing and VFX. In fact, we are one of the few
education centres in the world where with Smoke and Flame integrated with our

AG: How is the concept of CG Mantra evolving in India?
AR: We have received extremely heartening response from students as well as
the industry experts. Majority of our students are those who spent three to nine
months in other animation training institutes and migrated to CG Mantra after
seeing the learning environment. Retraining market is another segment that is
being tapped by us successfully. My own experience of running NIIT operations in
Europe and Middle East has been of immense help when designing the franchise
model for CG Mantra.
AG: How many centres do you presently have? What are the future target
locations for your expansion?
AR: We are not at all in a hurry to set up large numbers as soon as possible. Our
expansion is based on the Hub and Spoke concept. Every hub will have all major
facilities and support three to four spoke centres. As a proof of concept we have
set up a hub and spoke combination in Delhi. We will replicate this model in all
metros. Besides this, we will be setting up spoke centres only in Tier-II cities.",False,1,,False,v_varun16,True,1265260921,0,1,t5_6,t3_axv14,c0jyjpc,reddit.com,0

The only expensive thing in HK is the rent.  My friend has a 300 Sq ft studio apartment in a old building Central (Main business district and bar/restraunt area) for 6000HKD, around 850 USD.

You can live extremely cheap in Hong Kong if you live like a local, which is the best way to live in any city.  I can get a really really really good meal in Hong Kong for under for 3 USD, whether this be a Siu Mei with rice (Roast pork, duck, chicken served on rice) or Noodles with meat balls/fish balls all with an ice lemon tea, and I guarentee you this tastes ten times better than that new flash expensive hip Chinese eatery that just opened downtown, wayyyyyy better.  
I have been to ""The best Chinese Restaurant"" in many international cities, and the hole in the wall in HK does it better every time, for a fraction of the price.  How much do you pay for dinner? There is no mandatory tipping here, and if you do people are more than happy with the 1USD.  In Tokyo, they refuse tips, its like you have to run away from them, I had the coolest concierge dude at my hotel, I had to shove money in his pocket and run!

Supermarkets are pretty cheap, local markets are hella cheap and good, that's where I get my food. Well not me...My helper, Rowena ( I don't like the word maid).  Tons of good cheap shopping I guess, but I don't like that shit.  
Computer components are cheap as it is all made across the border and in Taiwan.  Something I have seen in the PC mall near my house for 5 USD I have seen the same thing in PC World in London for 20 Pounds, this was at a time when the pound was nearly 2x1 on the USD, that shitty usb hub cost nearly 40 USD. I nearly spat my drink everywhere when I saw that

Now onto travel.  A 12 mile cab ride here costs about 11 bucks.  Thats the cheapest cab I have taken in a first world country.  Hell the cabs in Bali, Indonesia cost more! 

The MTR or 'Mass Transit Railway"" is the best and cheapest public railway system I have ever been on.  One stop on MTR = 0.6 cents USD One stop on London Underground = 6.3 USD.  Granted it has not been around as long as the London Underground or Tokyo Underground, it is much cleaner, efficient, cheaper, than all.  The trains are twice as wide as the London Underground. 

Now, buses, whatever you get the point, they are cheap as hell...And there are too many of them!

Now Media...
Video games, half the cost of the US and UK.  They have to fight piracy so the price we pay now is already too much...
Movies / DVD same deal as above.  Blu Ray is standard pricing.
Cinema Ticket for Saturday night, 10USD or 6-7 for Student - average...

&gt; My solution, as you can surmise, is to make state Universities free for citizens.

My solution is the opposite.  End all subsidies for education.  Privatize both University and primary school education for all citizens.  Our society will continue to prosper with half as many Bachelor's degrees.  This is exactly the point of the free MIT education example.  Motivated students can learn for free.  All others are wasting their own time and other people's money.

Ultimately, the problem with free education is that needs are unlimited, but means to fulfill them are limited.  People need food, shelter, clothing, and entertainment too.  Do you propose to provide unlimited amounts of those to all citizens?

The fact is that a country should still be allowed to reject an application for immigration if they do not believe the person will accept their culture.

We are instrumental surf mixed with thrash, horror, eastern european, and progressive strands of music.  So I guess we're avant-garde-ish and generally play these types of venues (all ages clubs, bars where cover bands would get shit thrown at them, indie bookstores, house parties, etc).  We're broke but generally have 100 or so people at most of our shows.    

I'm 28 now, I've been in bands that have played out since I was 16 (Alabama has a lax ""entertainers' law"" that allows minors in bars if they're in the band).  During undergraduate college, I was in a cover band to make money and played one or two gigs a week.  I've done a few tours in various bands, and I'm currently playing about every two weeks if you average it out annually, not counting touring.  In terms of proficiency, I'm a good enough musician to play in front of people, and there's a ""playing in front of people"" proficiency (talking to the audience, what to do when amp tube blows, when string breaks, when backup guitar string breaks, when wiring in club is criminally hazardous, when clubowner doesn't want to pay you, how to position amps in relationship to room acoustics, etc.) that you start to develop over a while.  I'm passionate about the music I write and take gigs seriously, but I don't expect Lovecraftian-speed-surf-horo songs to get turned into ringtones anytime soon, so my aspirations are to get the band to a level of notoriety that will allow us to tour annually and keep playing.  (In terms of money, anyway, we do better selling shirts than CDs or gig payments).  

Obviously, Alabama and the Southeast are WAAAAY different than NYC.  I generally prefer playing smaller towns when on the road because those are places where people are stoked to have something to do.  Last tour I went on, we went all the way from Alabama the LA in 2 weeks, and the best fucking gig we played was Hattiesburg, Mississippi.  I've never played in NYC, but gone out to LA, New Orleans, and Austin and have heard the NYC scene compared to these, inasmuch as:

(1) like LA, there is an entire industry based on ripping off small town hicks that want to play shows [i.e. ""pay-to-play"" bullshit; no free tab at the bar; ""we'll pay you if at least 35 people show up and say specifically they're here to see your touring band, who has never played in LA before and is third on the flyer.  and we'll pay you half of the door from those 35 or more people.""]. 

(2) Like New Orleans and Austin, there is too much fucking music and too many bands, so people won't necessarily come out just to see you unless they either know you, know your band, or have some reason to think it will be fun.

(3) Like all 3, there are so many hipsters that see so many bands that there is a level of cynicism that also prevents people from coming out or giving a shit about new bands. 

But that doesn't mean you can't get in there, it just means you've got to do your research.  Like, where do people who listen to your type of stuff go to drink?  Where do these people hang out otherwise (where do you flyer?), etc.   Although, once again, I've never been to NY, it seems that if you have a good gig and enough people show up, most bars are more than happy to have you back (and generally pay you more).  Also, obviously, find similar bands that seem a little more established (but not too established), and try to hop on one of their gigs (offer to play for free).  As someone who's been in a band, you probably knew most of that stuff already, though.

This is a completely reasonable method of organization in the Europe Marx was writing in.  Beyond the ability to strike and bargain collectively, the political and social advantages of unions were needed (prior to the modern welfare state): you'd have literacy education, lectures, drinking clubs, social welfare (prior to insurance), some protection from harassment by cops or mercenaries, legal representation, etc.  Much of this has been co-opted by the modern state, but a clear example of it in action in the U.S. somewhat recently were the Black Panthers, who organized their own schools, breakfast programs, and safety patrols in their neighborhoods.  In other words, the idea is to form a type of ""dual-power,"" or something that (1) fills a current social need of the people involved (2) can serve as a loose administrative / social framework post-revolution.  

The Paris Commune, which Marx commented on, was self-organized by workers who elected representatives, and drafted and enforced their laws.  Similarly, the various versions of Russian Marxist and revolutionary parties used unions this way (a soviet is a council of workers who elect a delegate who communicates / operates with other elected delegates, and delegates could be voted out at any time), although the soviet-council power structure began to be undermined by the Bolshevik ""democratic centralism,"" expedited by the Civil War around 1918 (and it only got worse from there, see, for example, the Krondstat uprising).    Although he was a brutal son-of-a-bitch during the Civil War, once he got booted from the Soviet Union, Lev Trotsky continued to organize Internationals, as sort of a counter-weight to the Comintern, up until his death.  

She is right, there are a lot of people who have questions about who would ""direct"" the revolution, and it probably wouldn't happen all at once.   This is a complicated problem of tactics that changes with the time and place, and you generally have to deal with problems like government informants, leftists' tendency to disagree (see Marx's rift w/ Bakunin), national borders and latent nationalist sentiments of what is supposed to be an international movement.  It isn't easy.  

But she's dead fucking wrong that people aren't capable of self-organization.  Perhaps she's talking in light of modern U.S. society.  She might have something of a point there, because the landscape of power, work, and politics have drastically changed since the 19th century (I know she's a sociologist and not an historian, but you'd think she could understand historical context / continuity).  But there's no reason the U.S. would be the front-runner in revolutionary politics (we've never been), and there's no reason that workers wouldn't organize other places in reaction to U.S. imperialism.  Oh, wait, that was what the entire 2nd half of the 20th century was... 

So if she thinks Marxism and the working-class are so fucking harmless, ask her why Pinkertons and the goddam CIA and FBI exist.

Anyway, here are some precursory readings from Marx that shouldn't take you too long and there are links for you to go as far as you want.

As for the question of should you speak up in class or not...  Well, that's up to you, but you're not just talking to her, you're talking to the entire class, right?  I'd say it's worth awkwardness or lower grades to get the point across and into other peoples' heads.  If you have reason to suspect she's grading you based on your political beliefs you have recourse to report her and get the grade adjusted (although that's a pain in the ass, so make sure you write good papers or whatever).

**Shift refuses to hand out European bank transaction details to Washington**

The Belgium based business Swift, which processes international payments, refuses to hand over banking details of EU citizens to the USA to assist the war on terrorism, says a Swift spokesman in German newspaper Handelsblatt.

An agreement was made which required the company to provide the details starting February 1st. However, Swift will not adhere to this agreement, says the spokesman: ""As long as the European parliament does not approve of this agreement, it will not go in effect.""

Swift is based in Terhulpen and processes transactions for over 8000 banks all around the world. According to the spokesman, Swift stopped sharing European banking details on January 1st. Swift first wants a legal basis to be in place.

Late November last year, the European ministers of Justice decided to push through Swift its agreement with the USA. It was supposed that the banking details would be shared for 9 months, starting February 1st 2010. European parliament protested fiercely, it was not consulted which would be required by the Treaty of Lissabon. The ministers of Justice pushed the agreement one day before the that treaty went into effect. But according to Swift, the agreement should require approval from the parliament.

The head of the European parliament, Jerzy Buzek, has already said he plans to undo the agreement. The parliament will make its decision on February 10.

Erm... No? Granted, the UK imports quite a bit of food, it hovers around 50% of total consumption, but then it also exports about half as much as it imports.  The reasons for that are partly price and more often availability... Last time I checked there were quite a lot of things that we can't grow in the UK, or at least not without a vast amount of waste and additional costs..

&gt;The UK used to grow all the food it need and plenty more

The UK hasn't been self sufficient since industrialisation and it is somewhat contentious to suggest that it was before then.  Even in WWII, when the UK was working hard to be utterly self sufficient it still relied on imports and rationing.   

&gt;due to EU rules we are no longer allowed too..

What isn't 'allowed'? Food production? Exporting the excess? I would love to see the legislation that bans either.

&gt;Is this progress?

Is this reporting from the Telegraph? Seriously, it is progress, that is why you can buy bananas in the shops, or strawberry's in winter, or Orange juice or anything else that we cannot grow here all year round.

PS; the bit about healthcare, do as the British and others did, put senior doctors/nurses/medical-union people, in charge of the building of the NHS, it worked in Europe. You have regional health authorities which administer the hospitals in their district/state/county. The only thing that comes from gov then is money.

A good percentage of the people working in the medical insurance industry will have medical experience or qualifications, yet they are wasting their lives/time on paperwork and claims. Theres better ways to employ trained people in an industry.

The medical world has had a triage system in place for generations, they know how to ration and allocate resources to patients that need it now, tomorrow or never. So its not likely that a complete meltdown of the US medical industry/hospitals would occur in a transition to a NHS system. On the contrary we are seeing hospitals close down now due to medical bills being unpaid, a situation that doesn't happen under a NHS system, where hospitals are built and run according to patient needs in populated areas. If theres attempted cutbacks due to some penny pinching politician interfering, patients and public soon scream blue murder and remedy things.

1. As a Indian I gotta mention these types of prayers would never happen in India. As far as I understand, even the Hindu right wingers here do not wish to give religion a place in the public sphere; their politics is more about identity and communalism. 

2. Perhaps its my atheist upbringing in a Hindu home, but I definitely have never heard such a prayer being offered by any Hindu. This prayer is being offered to a ""transcendent being"" or deity supreme; the Indian religious tradition is aware of the distinction between the deity supreme and lesser gods for close to 3 millenia now; but almost 99% of Hindus still worship personal gods and not ""deity supreme"". ofc, the personal gods are avatars or connected to the supreme being in some way or another; but there still is a distinction. Almost all Indian temples are dedicated to one god or another; but the deity supreme does have a place when we do what are called *yagnas* or *havans* but that happens rarely and not part of daily prayer ( of those who do that). Again I am not sure if everyone prays at *yagnas*.

3. Its funny how Americans Christians would point out to GOD having being mentioned in their declaration of independence as proof of theocratic founding of their nation, but should shout ""Jesus Christ"" when they heckle someone invoking the same ""creator/God/supreme being"".   

4. Just shows why the American revolutionaries never gave God a place in their document they wrote. They knew that even if they dedicated a nation to the glory of ""God"", Americans/people would still end up fighting which God that meant! They were all of different denominations and knew a thing or two about religious strife during the reformation etc in Europe.

This from a person that speaks a language that wasn't written before a pupil of [Martin Luther](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther) (the european guy, founder of Lutheranism, not M. L. King) decided to write the bible in said language - rest is history, as they say.

Arabs had big influence on [the algebra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_algebra), the word is even based on Arabic word *Al-Jabr*, meaning  something like restoration - exact meaning is lost to history.  

Sad thing of course is, that religions tend to embrace education when it suits their needs and vice versa, but that's not a surprise.

More sinister trend is, that there seem to be some factions (read ""those who talk about intelligent design"") that are quite openly anti-education. Most of what western civilizations have, is rooted on education. Civilizations rise and fall depending of it, I think history has proven this.

The greatest influence on the thinking of Mr. Marx was Capitalism's best freind, Adam Smith. Now if your prof is like like most profs she's likely never read either Smith or Marx but is spouting drivel she heard from her own professors. In studying psychology I found the same ignorance when profs gave their erroneous views on Freud. 

Much of what developed during the industrial revolution was predicted and ridiculed by Smith. The period was a wierd mix of circumstances. Most people don't realize that both Smith and Marx were writing about what they saw in England and in a lesser extent in Europe as a whole. Niether man knew much of the economic affairs of the rest of the world and neither one was prescient as to the structures of today. People don't realize how liimiting that view was when we consider that communication and travel were limited. England at the time was still under a fuedal system of entitlement and obligation which led to the social and economic structure of the day. That fuedal system actually made the exploitation of workers in the cause of economic expansion more effective than in other parts of Europe that had tossed off fuedalism. The *workers revolution* envisaged by Marx was to be an excise of feudal obligation and the rise of capitalism as espoused by Smith, in which the workers have control of thier own production for their own best benefit. 

Trying to give your prof an education is likely a waste of time as she has a piece of paper that declares that she knows all truth. Better to read Smith and Marx yourself, give her a low teaching evaluation, and be the wizer.  ",False,3,,False,OortCloud,True,1265295756,0,3,t5_2qjii,t3_axv2c,c0jz3hd,socialism,0

This is particularly the case when the sentence carried out is seen to greatly tilt away from established standards of international human rights.

&gt; *The supposed sound of the first character has a clear similarity with the name ""Hun"" in European languages. Whether this is evidence of kinship or mere coincidence is hard to tell. It could lend credence to the theory that the Huns were in fact descendants of the Northern Xiongnu who migrated westward, or that the Huns were using a name borrowed from the Northern Xiongnu, or that these Xiongnu made up part of the Hun confederation. As in the case of the Rouran with the Avars, oversimplifications have led to the Xiongnu often being identified with the Huns, who populated the frontiers of Europe. The connection started with the writings of the eighteenth century French historian de Guignes, who noticed that a few of the barbarian tribes north of China associated with the Xiongnu had been named ""Hun"" with varying Chinese characters. This theory remains at the level of speculation, although it is accepted by some scholars, including Chinese ones.

No shit.  The potential damage of invading North Korea or Iran far outweighs invading some dinky country like Uzbekistan or Somalia.  

The whole fucking point of nukes is to make any benefits from invasion pale in comparison to the nuclear damage inflicted.  How do you not understand this?

They have little effect on proxy wars, because those land wars are relatively insignificant.  If the USSR commenced a land invasion into places that mattered like West Europe, we'd launch our entire arsenal.

A land war can only work in places that are insignificant, like Vietnam, Korea, Afghanistan et al.  MAD covers all formalized Spheres of Influence for the USSR and USA.  Eisenhower coined the term ""massive retaliation"" in response to any Soviet aggression into Europe.

That's why these land wars never occurred in places that mattered.  MAD prevented them.  This is such a simple concept...

&gt;About what percentage of young people (say, in their 20's or younger) would you say are practicing Catholic or otherwise religious and serious about it?

In their 20s or younger? I'd guess less than 5%. However there'd be a lot of people who'd say ""Catholic"" when asked just because they got baptised; and go to church once a year (at Christmas, maybe Easter) without really believing half the stuff they're told.

&gt;Does anyone take the whole ""you're not supposed to have sex until you get married"" thing seriously anymore, or is casual sex their just as common and accepted as elsewhere in Europe?

No-one really takes the ""no sex before marriage"" thing that seriously, as I said most aren't religious and that would have been the only reasoning for it.
Even among religious people I'd find it hard to believe that they'd be against anyone having sex before marriage, perhaps they'd be against sex outside of a serious (monogamous and heterosexual) relationship, but probably not before marriage, although I've never really asked someone. Like wise I doubt most would be against contraception.

One night stands are also very common, there is a bit of ""oh she's a bit of a slut"" but I'm not sure you can blame religion on that. Likewise there are people who don't like the idea of one-night stands but for personal and not religious reasons (myself for one).

Influences of Roman law
The term ""common law"" is often used as a contrast to Roman-derived ""civil law"" (connotation 2), and the fundamental processes and forms of reasoning in the two are quite different. Nonetheless, there has been considerable cross-fertilization of ideas, while the two traditions and sets of foundational principles remain distinct.
By the time of the rediscovery of the Roman law in Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries, the common law had already developed far enough to prevent a Roman law reception as it occurred on the continent.[30] However, the first common law scholars, most notably Glanvill and Bracton, as well as the early royal common law judges, had been well accustomed with Roman law. Often, they were clerics trained in the Roman canon law.[31] One of the first and throughout its history one of the most significant treatises of the common law, Bracton’s De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae (On the Laws and Customs of England), was heavily influenced by the division of the law in Justinian’s Institutes.[32] The impact Roman law had decreased sharply after the age of Bracton, but the Roman divisions of actions into in rem and in personam used by Bracton had a lasting effect and laid the groundwork for a return of Roman law structural concepts in the 18th and 19th century. Signs of this can be found in Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of England,[33] and Roman law ideas regained importance with the revival of academic law schools in the 19th century.[34] As a result, today, the main systematic divisions of the law into property, contract, and tort (and to some extent unjust enrichment) can be found in the civil law as well as in the common law.[35]",False,2,,False,camopdude,True,1265315907,0,2,t5_6,t1_c0jzpg9,c0jztpw,reddit.com,0

On the basis of cognate pronunciation and Septuagint readings, some identify Keneh bosem with the English and Greek cannabis, the hemp plant.

There are, however, some authorities who identify the 'sweet cane' with cinnamon bark (Radak, Sherashim). Some say that kinman is the wood, and keneh bosem is the bark (Abarbanel).

In early 1945 the Red Army was in the process of overrunning the Germans, who only a year ago had been seen as having the best led, best equipped, most formidable military force on Earth. Zhukov was within a few hours drive by tank of Berlin while the conference was going on.

The Americans and the British were still slogging across the Continent. And while it was conceivable Patton or another general could have been given the resources to ""race"" to Berlin and potentially score a symbolic victory, there was no sensible military objective to be gained by attempting to forcibly co-occupy Eastern Europe with the Soviets. It would have been obvious to Stalin that we had a political objective. The Grand Alliance, such as it was, would have fallen apart, probably violently, and possibly starting another full-scale war. All before the Japanese had been defeated, and after years of a war that the American public was naturally hoping to conclude as rapidly as possible.

In order to believe that Yalta could have turned out differently, you have to believe we could have marched into Poland and scared the Soviets out.

Worked for FDR (who had licked the Depression even before WW2 broke out -- look at the jobs and Dow plots for 1940/1941), worked for Ike, worked for Nixon, worked for Reagan (spend-to-recovery is about the only part of Reaganomics that actually works -- cutting taxes certainly doesn't reduce deficits, what crazy person came up with that?).

Bush is/was pretty notorious for throwing finely nuanced systems up into the wind.  Fiscal conservatism was one of those things -- reining in taxes, declaring war, and pushing new entitlement programs is the trifecta of fiscal stupid, and G.W. ""Drunken Sailor"" Bush did all three.

When that happens people put some wire to bypass the fuse and make sure that the extra electricity consumption doesn't bring the fuse box down. The fuse box in our apartment was that kind with the dual-metal blades, the idea is that the metal gets hot when there's a short-circuit and because the blade is made of two different materials, one of them will dilate more than the other causing the blade to lift and stopping the current flow. My guess is that this works slower than the classic burning kind of fuses which caused the substation fuse to burn out first ...

Apples and oranges comparison - they do not really live in a ""land of plenty"" scenario.  That does not say that these foods are necessarily good for them - just because you're not overweight does not mean your body isn't suffering from the inflammatory and oxidative effects of the phytates, lectins and gluten in grains.

A problem with agriculture is that it allows for more people to survive on less - you have explosions of populations of people that can subsist on nearly nothing because they do not have to work as hard physically for our food.  This leads us to the massive slum populations in places like India and, for example, many places in Africa, where agriculture was introduced, populations explode, famine becomes the norm.

And grains are very new to our diet.  *Homo sapiens sapiens* has been around for 200,000 year, possible more.  Most evidence points to agriculture being around 10,000 years old, making grain, at most, a part of diet for 5% of our history.

An unfortunate byproduct of agriculture is that it disassociated reproductive fitness from physical fitness and dietary adaptations - how healthy someone is and/or able to adapt to the world around them becomes less a factor of whether or not they will reproduce, completely derailing evolution as we have known it.

So what has happened is that we've added a new food source and have not really had selective pressure to adapt to it.  So we don't, really.  This is why 1/3 of the population has more-than-baseline reaction to gluten, though really everyone has some measure of sensitivity to it.

There may be some cultures more adapted to eat grains, similar to how Northern Europeans and the Masai are more lactose tolerant than the general populace (though both cultures are VERY fond of ingesting FERMENTED dairy, in which lactose reaction is less prevalent anyway).   I am not aware of them, though rice as a grain is relatively innocuous (still far from ideal as a food), and perhaps Asians have adapted somewhat.

1426205219,0,t3_ay2po,,t1_c0k08cj,,"No common and concise definition exists for fascism and historians and political scientists disagree on what should be in any such definition.[15]

Paxton wrote that fascism is:

a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation or victimhood and by **compensatory cults of unity**, energy and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.[26]

Relation to Religion-

The attitude of fascism toward religion has run the gamut from persecution, to denunciation, to cooperation,[177] to embrace.[178] Stanley Payne notes that fundamental to fascism was the foundation of a purely materialistic ""civic religion"" that would ""displace preceding structures of belief and relegate supernatural religion to a secondary role, or to none at all"", and that ""though there were specific examples of religious or would-be 'Christian fascists,' fascism presupposed a post-Christian, post-religious, secular, and immanent frame of reference.""[179]

According to Payne, such ""would be"" religious fascists only gain hold where traditional belief is weakened or absent, as fascism seeks to create new non-rationalist myth structures for those who no longer hold a traditional view.[180] The rise of modern secularism in Europe and Latin America, and the incursion and large-scale adoption of western secular culture in the mid-east leave a void where this modern secular ideology, sometimes under a religious veneer, can take hold.[180]

Many fascists were anti-clerical in both private and public life.[181] Although both Hitler and Mussolini were anti-clerical, they both understood that it would be rash to begin their Kulturkampfs prematurely, such a clash, possibly inevitable in the future, being put off while they dealt with other enemies.[182] Hitler had a general plan, even before the Nazis' rise to power, to destroy Christianity within the Reich.[183][184][185]

The leader of the Hitler Youth stated ""the destruction of Christianity was explicitly recognized as a purpose of the National Socialist movement"" from the start, but ""considerations of expedience made it impossible"" publicly to express this extreme position.[183] In Mexico, the Red Shirts were vehemently atheist, renounced religion, killed priests, and on one occasion gunned down Catholics as they left Mass.[186][187][188][189][190]

According to a biographer of Mussolini, ""Initially, fascism was fiercely anti-Catholic"" — the Church being a competitor for dominion of the people's hearts.[191] Mussolini, originally an atheist, published anti-Catholic writings and planned for the confiscation of Church property, but eventually moved to accommodation.[177] Mussolini endorsed the Roman Catholic Church for political legitimacy, as during the Lateran Treaty talks, Fascist Party officials engaged in bitter arguments with Vatican officials and put pressure on them to accept the terms that the regime deemed acceptable.[192] Protestantism in Italy was not as significant as Catholicism, and the Protestant minority was persecuted.[193] Mussolini's sub-secretary of Interior, Bufferini-Guidi issued a memo closing all houses of worship of the Italian Pentecostals and Jehovah's Witnesses, and imprisoned their leaders.[194] In some instances, people were killed because of their faith.[195]

The Ustaše in Croatia had strong Catholic overtones, with some clerics in positions of power.[196] The fascist movement in Romania, known as the Iron Guard or the Legion of Archangel Michael, preceded its meetings with a church service, and their demonstrations were usually led by priests carrying icons and religious flags.[citation needed] The Romanian fascist movement promoted a cult of ""suffering, sacrifice and martyrdom.""[197][198]

In Latin America, the most notable fascist movement was Plinio Salgado's Brazilian Integralism. Built on a network of lay religious associations, its vision was of an integral state that ""comes from Christ, is inspired in Christ, acts for Christ, and goes toward Christ.""[199][200][201] Salgado, however, criticised the ""dangerous pagan tendencies of Hitlerism"".[202]

Hitler and the Nazi regime attempted to found their own version of Christianity called Positive Christianity which made major changes in its interpretation of the Bible which said that Jesus Christ was the son of God, but was not a Jew; they further claimed that Christ despised Jews, and that the Jews were the ones solely responsible for his death.[citation needed] By 1940, however, it was public knowledge that Hitler had abandoned even the syncretist idea of a positive Christianty.[203]

The Catholic Church was particularly suppressed by Nazis in Poland. In addition to the deaths of some 3 million Polish Jews, 2 million Polish Catholics were killed.[204] Between 1939 and 1945, an estimated 3,000 polish clergy (18 percent) were murdered; of these, 1,992 died in concentration camps.[204] In the annexed territory of Reichsgau Wartheland it was even harsher than elsewhere. Churches were systematically closed, and most priests were either killed, imprisoned, or deported to the General Government.

The Germans also closed seminaries and convents persecuting monks and nuns throughout Poland. Eighty percent of the Catholic clergy and five of the bishops of Warthegau were sent to concentration camps in 1939; in Chełmno, 48 percent.[204] Of those murdered by the Nazi regime, 108 are regarded as blessed martyrs.[204] Among them, Maximilian Kolbe was canonized as a saint. Not only in Poland were Christians persecuted by the Nazis. In the Dachau concentration camp alone, 2,600 Catholic priests from 24 different countries were killed.[204]

One theory is that religion and fascism could never have a lasting connection because both are a ""holistic weltanschauung"" claiming the whole of the person.[177] Along these lines, Yale political scientist, Juan Linz and others have noted that secularization had created a void which could be filled by a total ideology, making totalitarianism possible[205][206], and Roger Griffin has characterized fascism as a type of anti-religious political religion.[207] Such political religions vie with existing religions, and try, if possible, to replace or eradicate them.[206]

That's one way to put it. Seriously: Can you imagine President Truman telling the Soviets that he'd nuke Moscow if they didn't restore the Polish government-in-exile? Speak softly and carry a big stick is one thing, but that would have been insanely disproportionate. Communism perpetrated a lot of evil on the world, but nothing quite so nakedly, maliciously destructive.

&gt; They wouldn't have had to threaten them with nukes - just with war. Nukes were still taken as an usable weapon before the advent of MAD.

Nuclear weapons at this point were solely strategic (hence ""strategic bombing"", SAC, etc.), tactical weapons wouldn't be developed for some time to come, and even if they had been available, it's unlikely that they would have been decisive. A war with the Soviets would have meant hundreds of thousands of U.S. casualties. Heck, even if we did start picking off cities, it's not like there was much left standing in them at that point anyway, and their conventional forces surely would have retaliated brutally in Europe.

EDIT: Long story short: The only way to have prevented the outcome of Yalta would have been, ironically enough, to give Stalin exactly what he demanded so forcefully in 1942 and beyond: A second front. If the Allies had launched an invasion of Western Europe in 1942 and it had been successful, there's a chance they could have gotten to Berlin and even Eastern Europe before the Soviets.  In his heart, Hitler believed the West would ultimately be on his side as he slaughtered the Communists in the East, and it's unlikely he would have thrown all his forces into Western Europe if he felt the tide turning against him.

But a successful second front in Europe in 1942 seems almost fanciful for a host of reasons. Who knows? Maybe if the U.S. and Britain had been willing to accept the level of casualties that the Soviets suffered they could have given it a go.",False,5,,True,twoodfin,True,1265329124,0,5,t5_2qh53,t1_c0k02gw,c0k09rd,history,0

1426205243,0,t3_awqla,,t1_c0k0a8v,,"&gt; This is telling. If I could give you a piece of advice: If you're in a home where people pray before meals, bow your head and go along, even if you don't happen to believe in god. I bet a lot of people call what you are saying ""racist."" You can most likely avoid this by replacing the word ""race"" with the word ""tribe"" in your speech. Further, you're making a fundamental mistake when saying traditional concepts of race correspond to actual sub-species of humans. For example, Colin Powel is ""black,"" but he has no African ancestory to speak of. By failing to recognize that actually existing notions of race do not correspond to actually existing sub-species, you're coming off as a racist. 

Telling of what? I actually live in predominately non-religious but highly liberal area, though it might as well be the same given how close-minded and ignorant both the left-wing and right-wing typically are (I consider myself more of a Centrist). In a liberal area if I point out something that Blacks do better than Whites, people would agree; if I point out something Whites do better than Blacks, they would say I'm “racist”. The documentary “A Conversation about Race” provides a fairly good example of this.

I understand that most people have a skewed perception of race, primarily due to the propaganda and indoctrination in our education systems and mainstream media, but I'm not so sure the real issue lies with the words used. Perhaps I'm wrong and new words are needed in order to get people to pay attention to information rather than scoff at it as “racist”. 

Colin Powell is predominately Black, but White admixture can be seen (such as his skin pigmentation, thinner lips, etc). I would be inclined to label Colin Powell as just a mulatto (mixed), but his children, grandchildren or great-grandchildren may be Black if mixing continues with more pure Blacks. The warped perception of what is “White” or “Black” can be seen with Obama, who is considered to be Black, despite him being half-White and half-White, thus he is a mulatto. 

&gt; So replace race with the word tribe. There are three main human tribes, Africans, Europeans and Asians. There are sub-tribes within each tribe, and some sub-tribes are hybrids. There are also sub-sub-tribes. The fact that the actual situation is inconvenient for the lazy diction of lay taxonomy should be expected as this is a scientific issue - people descend from the people they descend from and are in some significant part determined by their ancestors in a typically complex way. 

There are actually more than just three main races/sub-species/tribes. Historically, prior to the propaganda and suppression of science after WW2, there were approximately four main groups recognized. These were: Caucasoid (Europeans/Whites, Arabs, etc), Mongoloid (Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, etc), Negroid (“Black” groups), and Australoid (Papuans, Australian Aborigines, groups in India, etc). There was also a later addition called the “Capoid” race/sub-species, which the Khoisan/Bushmen of Africa belong to (who are not “Black”). There are some past (and present) attempts at further re-categorizing the races/sub-species including possibly making American Indians separate; they were historically classified as Mongoloid but they have been separated for so long that they may have diverged far enough to be their own race/sub-species. Polynesians are another group worth research. However scientific research into this area has been suppressed, and people risk losing their careers or reputations, so they usually avoid it. It is very sad that we have something like this happening in this day and age; it is a lot like the people that were suppressed or killed for saying the Earth was round and orbited the Sun.

&gt; Advantages are inherited as well, and I would be very surprised if any sufficient body of scientific evidence existed to establish that the disadvantages of cross-tribal adoption outweigh the advantages. History, for it's part, shows that ancient tribes exchanged members at a limited but appreciable rate. 

It is possible for the advantages to be inherited yes; it could go either way with inheriting the advantages or disadvantages, but I haven't read anything on whether one is actually more likely to occur than the other so I can't say for certain. 

However, it is very likely that the mixing would result in a mediocre and unremarkable group. This can already be seen in “contact” areas where mixing has occurred (typically through wars and conquest). The mixed groups show a historical trend in being mediocre and paling in comparison to the races/sub-species of their origin. If you examine nearly every mixed group, such as Turkic people of Central Asia, just about everything they claim as part of their own culture is something adopted from either side of their origins (Caucasoids, Mongoloids). Nearly all the civilizations, inventions, and culture comes from the more pure and original groups, with the mixed groups copying the “parent” races' advances. The more pure people also seem to be viewed as the most beautiful (subjective, but it still has merit). 

I see no advantages in mixing our races, or ethnicities within the races, as any coordinated or large scale effort. Each race, and even the ethnicities within a race, offer their own strengths, weaknesses and different thought processes that contribute and balance out our species as a whole. Some races and ethnicities may be better or worse at certain things than others, but everyone has a place as part of humanity. 

So many people proclaim to support “diversity”, but in reality what they're supporting is the genocide of our unique and diverse races, ethnicities and cultures in favor of a bland, mediocre and homogenous race of humans. Real diversity is what we have, distinct races, ethnicities and cultures; all of which should be protected, preserved and kept as pure as possible so that each one can continue evolving and advancing in their own right.

The fact is, social engineering just doesn't scale all that well, unless it happens to coincide with popular sentiment.  You can rant on about how GM ""social engineered"" us into becoming a car-centric society by buying up transit lines and shutting them down, but the fact is, when they pushed us in that direction, we went along willingly.  Individual mobility is a hell of an empowering thing.  It must be, or drivers wouldn't put up with the consequences they already have to deal with.

My own belief is that the way to solve the dilemma is by forcing motor-vehicle drivers to pay something closer to the true costs of a car-centric society.  If gas were $8/gallon, people wouldn't insist on living 15 miles from their workplaces, and we wouldn't be debating how to ""force"" people onto the trains.  Right now, though, we have this ridiculous schizoid approach that satisfies almost nobody except for Sound Transit employees.

You don't need to enslave people with guns - simply isolate them from the ability to legally feed themselves, and wait for them to sell their children.

As for peaceful beliefs, they didn't have to fight often, before the 20th century. They were, if I understand this correctly, MUCH admired by the mongols - a driving military force in the area. They had all the protection they needed. They 'outsourced' their protection, and cultivated none of their own.

When the early 1900s came about and every european power with a single ship was putting flags on a piece of land that didn't disappear underwater for more than 300 days a year - tibet was done for. ultimately a few world wars gave tibet some breathing room - until china had stabilized just enough to realize - there was no way they were going to let a non-communist power establish a toehold on that side of the himalayas.

Ultimately as regrettable as Minoa, or Phonicia, or any of the thousands of others of lost cultures... bad timing, bad placement, no effective force capable of resisting foreign incursion.

and if you get the chance, noam chompsky has lots to say about tibet.

Now, I've presented a reasonable alternate view of things. I will grant that I have used a wide brush to paint quickly this view... but I have drinking to get to. 

Before the drinking, and as gently and diplomatically as I can possibly put this; just because lots of people feel the way you do, doesn't make it true. It doesn't make it false either - not claiming that for a second. But often, because views are popular, people don't feel the need to defend them.

And occasionally... once in a great while, when forced to defend popular beliefs... one finds they are unable to - that's usually about the time they start repeating them louder.

There is tons of peer reviewed research backing up this data.  As for the historical evidence, that dates back to the Egyptians and Greeks:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8363200.stm

Hippocrates researched the causes and cases of heart disease in ancient greece.  You're welcome to look up the references yourself.  It is difficult to go back much before this time.  But I can guarantee you that simple glucose, refinened sugars, trans fats and McDonalds burgers didn't exist back then.

Your entire argument is one of a giant conspiracy.  I'm sorry, I really have no time for such things.  You seem, like most people nowadays, to believe that science is so easily thwarted by powerful 'interests'.  This appears to be an American condition and one held by those who have no background in science.  In the rest of the world science is conducted seriously and mostly impartially.  Scientists are naturally flawed; just like you or me.

EU banking data deal with U.S. becomes a damp squib

Stage victory for Europe's Data Protection:  The Swift agreements regarding bank data sharing with the U.S. will not be implemented right away as planned. The Belgian financial services provider Swift, which provides the data, denied until further cooperation with European and American authorities.  Now comes a bilateral arrangement?

BRUSSELS.  The controversial new EU agreement on the transfer of European banking data to U.S. terror investigators has run into a hurdle. Without a clear and reliable legal basis, no bank records would be delivered, said a Swift spokesman in Brussels.  So far, there has been neither a request nor a transfer of such data (by the U.S.). 

The blockade is supported by the BvdB (Federal Association of German Banks). ""Until now, customer privacy was not adequately secured,"" said association spokesman Thomas Schlüter. The banking industry has put a lot into ensuring that access to such data will be withheld from the U.S. authorities.  According to Schluter, the association is not in a hurry to implement the agreement.  Swift must decide how to proceed. 

Data transfer was to have begun on Monday 

Swift is an international association representing approximately 9000 banks, central banks and other financial companies.  Their computer servers carry more than 15 million transactions worth an estimated six billion dollars daily.  In the Swift agreements, the EU promises the U.S. to provide bank account details on request, to hunt down suspected terrorists.  (According to the agreement,) the data transfer was to have begun on Monday. 

But nothing came of it: ""We will not apply the new agreement,"" said a Swift spokesman yesterday. So far, the agreement lacked the approval of the European Parliament, which, according to the Lisbon Treaty, has a voice in internal affairs. ""As long as the EU Parliament has not approved the agreement, it is not in force,"" said the spokesman. Therefore, no data could be transmitted. MEPs (Members of European Parliament) will take up the matter on 10 February, a refusal is likely. 

Access to European bank transfer information has been suspended since 1 January, Swift said. Since the beginning of this year, data has been processed on servers located in the Netherlands and Switzerland - not (on servers in) Washington DC (which was up until recently the practice). Therefore, U.S. terror investigators, who gained access to such coveted data after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 without any clear legal basis, must now do without such data.  Even European services analyze the findings. 

The EU Commission and the Council of Ministers in Brussels have expressed their support for Swift Agreement and have warned about a ""lapse of security"". German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière (CDU) argued that such groups as the ""Sauerland Group"" (purported German islamic terrorist cell) had been identified using banking information. The German Federal Criminal Police, however, expressed doubt and criticized the ""considerable material and human effort"" required (to evaluate such data). 

Massive invasion of privacy 

The interruption is a victory for data protection.  European Data Protection Supervisor Peter Hustinx has repeatedly warned about the tapping of data from Swift.  (He expressed the opinion that) the agreement is a massive grab into the private sphere. ""It's about the private lives of all Europeans, who do bank transfers within Europe."" The processing of commercial data for law enforcement purposes violates a fundamental principle of the protection of information, (it must be purpose-bound).  Furthermore, the benefit is not proven. 

The Council of Ministers, which had negotiated and finalized the agreement, reacted calmly to the suspension of data transfer. This was a decision of the Swift company, a spokesman said. It was expected that the situation would be clarified with the vote of Parliament in the coming week. However, there was no ""plan B"" if the agreement fails, an EU diplomat conceded. Perhaps the United States would then seek a bilateral solution with those countries in which the Swift servers with European data are located. That would weaken data privacy even more, the diplomat said. 

Swift is also concerned about this. The U.S. could try to get at the data via bilateral agreements, the company says.  The Americans have already done it this way; especially Belgium, where Swift is headquartered, has come under pressure. Such an approach would, however, raise new questions, Brussels said. Any bilateral agreements must be legally sound and assure data privacy. 

""We shall turn our attention to the relevant political, legal and data protection authorities to resolve the problem,"" announced the Swift spokesman.  Thus begins (what could turn into) a months-long tug of war, with an unclear finish.  Certain is only that the EU needs to renegotiate the agreement again.  The current, controversial text is only valid for the next nine months.  This spring, the EU Commission intends to submit a new draft, which should then lead to a definitive agreement. 

The European Parliament is anything but unhappy about the anticipated delays. ""We have to be patient - we can do without these Swift agreements, until our demands are met,"" said the FDP (German Free Liberal) representative Alexander Alvaro. ""I welcome Swift's announcement that it will no longer convey European bank data to the U.S. government,"" rejoiced the Green politician Jan Philipp Albrecht. The Parliament will no longer be ignored. 

Parliament had repeatedly complained that they were not involved in the Swift negotiations. Besides Liberals, Greens and Social Democrats, Christian Democrats had also spoken out against the agreement. It would create a ""glass (transparent) citizen"", said the CSU MEP Markus Ferber. However, it is unclear whether Ferber's colleagues from Southern and Eastern Europe see it that way as well.  There, data protection is not as much an issue.",False,3,,False,neptoon_,True,1265350967,0,3,t5_2qh13,t1_c0jyszz,c0k0up2,worldnews,0

Sticker price of things seemed about the same, maybe 20% higher (ie. a lunch that would be worth $10 US dollars cost about $10 or $12 pesos, meaning $3-4 USD.  At first I stayed in a hostel and looked for a place.  I ended up finding a place in the barrio Congreso with the recommendation by some girls that I had met the first time I spent a week there during college while travelling.  I can't remember the exact price of the apartment but I think I payed something like $300USD/month.  I lived with 3 others (a Swiss, a Mexican, and an Argentine).  I'm remember that payed more than the Mexican and Argentine roommate, but I thought the price was fair for myself.  When I showed up, I spoke little-to-no Spanish.  I enrolled in some spanish classes for 3-4 hours a day, primarily motivated by the urge to not make a fool of myself every time I opened my mouth (this happened constantly).  I can't remember the price of the classes but it was pretty fair as well (if I had to guess I'd say that it was somewhere near $150-$200 a month).  I also bought a classical guitar and took some guitar lessons.

No Arguments, no Intreaties, nor Tears of their Friends and Relations, could persuade many of them to leave their new Indian Friends and Acquaintance; several of them that were by the Caressings of their Relations persuaded to come Home, in a little Time grew tired of our Manner of living, and run away again to the Indians, and ended their Days with them. On the other Hand, Indian Children have been carefully educated among the English, cloathed and taught, yet, I think, there is not one Instance, that any of these, after they had Liberty to go among their own People, and were come to Age, would remain with the English, but returned to their own Nations, and became as fond of the Indian Manner of Life as those that knew nothing of a civilized Manner of Living. And, he concludes, what he says of this particular prisoner exchange “has been found true on many other Occasions.”

Benjamin Franklin was even more pointed: When an Indian child is raised in white civilization, he remarks, the civilizing somehow does not stick, and at the first opportunity he will go back to his red relations, from whence there is no hope whatever of redeeming him. But when white persons of either sex have been taken prisoners young by the Indians, and have lived a while among them, tho’ ransomed by their Friends, and treated with all imaginable tenderness toprevail with them to stay among the English, yet in a Short time they become disgusted with our manner of life, and the care and pains that are necessary to support it, and take the firstgood Opportunity of escaping again into the Woods, from whence there is no reclaiming them.

There was always the great woods, and the life to be lived within it was, Crevecoeur admits, “singularly captivating,” perhaps even superior to that so boasted of by the transplanted Europeans.

&gt; They were the foundation on which the Chinese military resistance rested. They fed the troops, oiled the machines, tended to the soldier's children, maintained the roads, etc. and thereby, indirectly, were responsible for the killing of Japanese invaders. 

So tell me, what justification would you offer for the way that the Japanese speared and slaughtered infants.  What justification can you offer for the torture they inflicted that want beyond simple nullifying a Chinese military resource (as you see civilians).

&gt; Of course, we don't hesitate to drag through the mud those poor, defenseless countries with no means of retaliation (see: Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, etc.).

The war we engaged in against Iraq and Afghanistan is far removed from the ""total war"" you describe in Japan's invasion of China.

You seem to forget or ignore that many wars were waged in which such atrocities did not occur.  Take the American Civil War, which despite the extreme scorched earth policy, still never became a slaughter of civilians.  Or consider the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Spanish-American war, the allied invasion/occupation of Germany in WW2, the Winter War, the many wars between the UK and France, or basically any other war between European nations barring Germany's holocaust.

Such barbaric slaughter may have been a part of war back in the days of swords and shields, or in wars between very different cultures or a developed culture versus primitives, but it's hardly a fixture of modern or even recent western warfare.

It is unfortunate that Indian culture has been marginalised. That their peoples were massacred and driven off their lands. I think social programmes meant to help them are a worthy cause.

EDIT: thinking on it, I think core of the issue (or what upsets me about it, I guess) is that admission is regulated by ancestry.

I'm not familiar with the process of approval for medical devices but for drugs I can agree it's a very long and annoying process for a lot of companies.
It also depends on whether you're seeking approval in the EU or US as under the FDA approval can take around 10 months, and in the EU it generally takes about 8 months, but the PDUFA or EMEA date can be delayed if more testing is needed in which case the drug is withdrawn from approval application and goes back to Phase III testing which is a long and expensive process itself. Also sometimes companies can fail laboratory testing during approval which results in a complete response letter.

It can also depend on the advisory committee of both the FDA or EMEA as the decision can often follow the advice of the committee, if the committee doesn't find the application worthy they usually tend to follow suit.

Sometimes pharmaceutical companies can form a joint acquisition or merge completely in order to fund the drug approval process.

Basically put, you're absolutely right. If you leave the country you can't come back but they won't come looking for you either on charges like you've got.

The world, with a few exceptions, will quite happily listen to and deal with Dubai or Iran and their allies, most places have diplomatic representation in Iran and business dealings with Iran, so Dubai being a 'collaborator' is somewhat moot. Dubai also happens, as a part of the UAE to be a signatory to the treaty of Rome, unlike the US for example, and so a party that sees the ICC and the warrants it issues as valid, along with a hundred or so other nations (including most of Europe).

I think the main point is that whilst Saudi is a US ally and has in the past played a role in trying to get Dubai to move from it's pro-Iranian position, it is probably that Dubai has gained more from its pro-Iranian stance than it has lost.  Moreover Dubai would have 'fallen' to the same degree regardless, it is true that Saudi could have 'helped' more if Dubai had been willing to collaborate with it and the US, but again, that is arguable.  Lastly, Dubai largely seems to be helping Iran get around US imposed sanctions, not UN sanctions, and it is acting as an intermediary for Western and European companies (and seeing a benefit...), US sanctions (like those against Cuba) are generally ignored by most of the world, partly because there is a lack of agreement as to their necessity (otherwise they would be part of the UN sanction set) and partly because it would go against their own interests..

The point is that people in Africa are not ""stupid"", but under-educated and under-privileged. Pretty much the entire continent has been severely abused and exploited by the more ""developed"" nations - and this in very recent history. The Europeans and Americans made big business out of carving up large parts of the continent into separate states, which bore no relevance to existing tribal divisions, and then dragged out natural and human resources (in the form of slaves) for their own benefit. As we moved on out of those dreadful days these arbitrary states were ""handed back"" to local rule. The new rulers of these countries attempted to emulate the barbaric tyranny of their prededcessors and as a result we have an large number of corrupt and dysfunctional countries ion Africa where life often hard, painful and short.

So it's unfair to characterise poorly-educated Africans as ""stupid"" because they are victims of circumstance, and we, in the more developed nations, bear a huge responsibility for that.

I speak from experience by the way, having lived for part of my childhood in Ghana in West Africa. Nowadays we would call people from the country ""Ghanaians"" but actually their cultural roots stem from various pre-colonial kingdoms, including the *Ashanti* who you may have heard of. The Ghanaians are fine people, predisposed to a certain infectious kind of friendliness, and they are certainly not ""stupid"". The state of Ghana has been turbulent since it gained independence from the British in 1957 and has suffered a series of coups and changes of government, which has made life pretty tricky.

Pick any country in Europe.  How long would it take to drive from the furthest point in that country to it's closes neighboring country?  Now take the United states.  How long would it take to drive from the furthest point in in the US to it's closest neighboring country (all two of them because the us is so fucking big)?

Can you see a difference?  Would that affect perception?

What percentage of Europeans have been to another country?

What percentage of Americans have been to another country?

Do you think that would have an affect on perceived size?

Comparing American's perception of a continent they've probably never been to is silly.

Europe is only 8% bigger than the United States.  Not much of a difference, especially considering you're comparing one country (the United States) to an entire continent made up of 50 countries (including the Vatican).

BTW - Americans are notorious for being ignorant of world geography because they just don't give a shit.  It doesn't affect their daily lives.

You are absolutely correct, if you want a house in Toronto, you'll have to pay extra for it for the reasons you mentioned. 

Are houses cheap in Toronto? The affordable average 10-20 year old house with 2 floors and 2 garages and about 3000 sq ft. are probably about $350-650,000 depending on the address (pulling numbers out of my head). That is about 4 million Yuan (RMB), for a house that is in one of the largest cities in Canada.

Comparing to China, a house in one of the largest cities, you name it, Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, or wherever, the price of a house that is about 3000 sq ft / 300 sq m, would cost about from 10 million Yuan which is about $1.5 Million CDN and goes upwards, with the quality / workmanship untested against time, and generally quite far from the city core.

So Chinese view these houses in Vancouver or Toronto as absolute bargain. 

Even with the land tax and yard maintenance along with H2O + gas + electricity, buying a house still beats buying a condo unit because of a condo's maintenance fee alone which escalates every year as the building requires more and more money to maintain (elevators go up and down quite a bit), while condo units still gets hit with property tax just the same as a house.

Even if the green belt (Toronto) gets permission for housing, being so far away from city core will only attract those who can't afford to be in and around the cores, and those who can stand the commute. 

Although you are right that many local folks are being forced into debt, or unnecessarily higher debt due to higher housing prices, however, the wealth effect is still there to offset it. It's a bitch however, to newly weds, students entering the job market, or those who haven't bought a house yet prior to the current boom.

So with the reasons you have listed above, what could be the ""equalizer"" that will dampen the market? My guesses are the following.

1) Ownership / Residency rule change. (Not likely but hey...who can guess what politicians think?)

2) Interest rates increase. (Somewhat likely but if it's not big changes, the effects will be muted)

3) Job market deterioration. (Somewhat likely)

4) Crash of Chinese economies (which means the US crashed too as China earns much from export to US, which means Europe crashed too as Europe also relies on US for export revenue) (somewhat likely and this will drain the flood of buyers and money available for properties in Vancouver and Toronto in particular) 

5) Changes in immigration laws / number of immigrants accepted (not likely, as Canada need the youth replacement for the aging population and foreign money coming into the country)

6) Crime rates swell around housing belts. (somewhat likely if economy keeps being clogged and job market goes down) 

7) Natural disasters / epidemics such as a repeat of SARS or similar. (likely but effects are temporary, or at least I hope)

Its theoretical development can be characterised in alternative schools and successive stages. These especially include the early works of the 1st-2nd centuries CE (such as the Heichalot texts and the earliest existent book on Jewish esotericism Sefer Yetzirah); the Medieval flowering of the 12th-13th century CE (of which the main book is the Zohar); and early-modern developments, including the mystical revivals of 16th century Safed (especially of Isaac Luria), and 18th century Eastern Europe (new Hasidic popularisations of Kabbalah).

one goes through enough experience in life while growing up, though, to know that it's not ok to make fun of people in cruel ways.  making fun of fat people gets old, it's the most uncreative way to make jokes and possibly the easiest target one could choose to make a joke about.

this joke is funny though, despite your sensitivities.  i think the real comical value in the joke is not so much that she's fat but that she's clearly such and oddball in the group and totally managed to fuck up the picture because she couldn't jump with the rest of them. i feel really bad that people are so disrespectful to you.  but many humorous things posted here can be offensive.  i've been offended a few times by jokes on reddit, as well.

some people have no regard for the emotions of others... jokes labeled [pic] are usually done at someone else's expense.  i think the reason why people find it acceptable and easy to make fun of certain subject matters (such as being fat) has to do with the perception that those people ""can help it but they choose not to"".  it's in the same spirit of how we make fun of jersey shore type people, ignorant tea party protesters, etc.

i'm not saying it's right, this is just the way that people are able to reason it.  the root cause of obesity can be different from people to people (genetic and psychological components apply), but the mechanism for storing fat in the human body is very simple: calories in, calories out.  this is scientific and undisputed... you can only get fat if you eat more than your body is able to cope with. different people have different metabolisms, but with a reasonable diet (ie one that's low in refined sugars, low in processed and fatty foods, and a bit higher in greens and fruits), 99% of the cases of obesity would likely disappear (compare white americans with european ancestry to europeans with similar genetic compositions but way different diets, and it's easy to understand that diet is a huge part of the problem).

it's unfortunate that your friends and others pick on you.  that is inexcusable behavior and those people should learn how to treat others with respect.  but there is only one realistic way to make the teasing go away permanently, and that would be to lose some weight.

i don't mean to be hard on you, but it is a lot easier to change yourself than to change society.  not to mention all of the health benefits you would get by losing weight.

whatever the case, you have choices in life, dude.  being fat is not a disability... but if you believe it is, then ultimately you will always pity yourself and turn it into one.  be fat and be happy... or if you can't be happy by the way you're treated when fat, lose weight and see what results you get.  and them dump all your friends for being such assholes

 I'll try and be brief

* Museums - The museums in London are free as they are government funded. You should definitely go to the Natural History Museum which, in my humble opinion, is one of the most beautiful building I've seen and an amazing museum. Give yourself time though! Nearby is the also awesome science museum and the Victoria and Albert museum, depending on what takes your fancy. This leaves you near Kensington (a rich area) where you can head into the British institution that is Harrods (big, upmarket, famous department store) and Harvey Nicks. Also if it's a nice day you're right by Hyde Park so take a stroll, it's gorgeous (and on a Sunday has speaker's corner in the top right which is where people stand on boxes and have crazy opinions and can be funny...) If you like the sound of parks then visit Regent's Park, one of the nicest parks I've seen (on a nice day at least). Also I'd be a failure if I didn't mention the gorgeous British Muesum, but go in with an agenda, there's too much to see! Also the museum of everything is a great museum near Camden which has loads of random found art.

* Markets - London is famous for its markets. On a Saturday or Sunday head to Camden Market (in the trendy area of Camden) for a massive market with all the retro clothes, quirky cult stuff, food and suchlike you can handle. You'll get lost but it's great fun I think. If you like antiques/the film Notting Hill/seeing George Orwell's house go to Portabello road market, it's usually packed but has some gorgeous antiques and cool collectibles and books etc. really nice area! Also Spitalfields near Liverpool Street is a lovely market with some really cool restaurants etc.

* Nightlife - If you want clubs there's the best club in the world (fabric) but I'll assume you don't (ask if you do). If you head to Camden you can find some great intimate gigs, usually in upper rooms at bars where there's often a few gems. Also if you head to Soho and go to the Arts clubs you'll have a wonderful time in a nice social setting. Google Trisha's and see if it takes your fancy.

* Other stuff - sure see the eye and the gherkin and big ben etc. but don't forget to walk all around soho and covent garden, there's some really nice little side streets that will take you off guard and can be really charming. For instance St Christopher's Place jst off Oxford Street (the biggest shopping street in the world - busy!) is a gorgeous little hideout with some lovely eateries.

I'm sure I've forgotten stuff so I'll edit if I think of things.

Any questions just ask!

Edit:

* Bookshops: Ok this might not be a big one but there's some great bookshops in London. On Piccadilly there's the oldest bookshop in the UK (Hatchard's) and the biggest bookshop in Europe (Waterstone's) next to each other! And just on Charing Cross Road nearby there's (amongst 20 + other bookshops) Foyles, the famous independent bookstore which is much-loved. While you're in Piccadilly why not visit the gorgeous Fortnum and Mason for amazing food and luxury goods (it's really nice!) and since you're in the west end go see a musical! There's many famous musicals running at the moment. Just next to Piccadilly Circus is Leicester Square, which is famous for its cinemas (12+ cinemas on or around Leicester Square). I've got off topic (bookstores!) but go see a film there, why not. You can also visit and awesome geek culture store Forbidden Planet just between Soho and Covent Garden which leads me to my next bookstore recommendation - 'Gosh' - it's a world famous and amazing comic bookstore. My final recommendation is the London Review Bookstore which is an amazing bookstore for academic texts.

Edit2:

* Random stuff. If you're here for chinese new year, or even if not, you should definitely visit china town. If you like pretty things visit Kew Gardens (though it's a bit out of the way). If you like shopping go along Oxford Street (and Westfields if you've got the time) and Regent Steet/Bond Street (upper class shopping that is, though RS has the awesome National Geographic store). If you like candy go to cyber candy near Covent Garden for awesome retro and rare chocolate and sweets. If you like tailoring go to Savile Row! If you like a peculiar mix of sleaze and hipness go to Soho (well just go anyway, it's nice). If you like pizza get Pizza Hut whole meal for £5 or go to Jazz Pizza Express and if you like hummus go to hummus bros.!

&gt; Medieval man was superstitious, believing that witches and demons walked the earth doing evil deeds. The church became a central part of medieval life and in its quest for power, preached that the old ways of worship were evil.
&gt;
&gt;Medieval man thought the cat had supernatural powers and any misfortune was blamed on them. Anything from sour milk to an outbreak of disease was blamed on our furry friends. 
&gt;
&gt;When the Bubonic Plague began sweeping across Europe in 1351 the superstitions of the day pointed the fingers of blame at cats. Hundreds of thousands of cats were destroyed. The sad truth was that the plague was carried by ticks that were attached to rodents that the cats would have caught thus helping to control the disease. The superstitions of the day actually helped the disease. 
&gt;
&gt;Cats were even thought to be witches in disguise, running in the darkness of night to perform evil acts. Cats were burned, boiled, stoned, flayed, stabbed, gutted, dropped from high places, hanged, impaled and buried alive with an almost religious fervor.
&gt;
&gt;To own a cat during these times was risking ones life as many an old lady was accused of witchcraft simply because she kept a cat as a companion. Throughout these bleak times, however, some did remain loyal to the furry feline.

[The History of Human-Animal Interaction](http://www.libraryindex.com/pages/2149/History-Human-Animal-Interaction-MEDIEVAL-PERIOD.html):

&gt;Cats came under suspicion for a variety of reasons. Unlike dogs, they did not behave subserviently toward humans. This was considered unnatural, because it violated the biblical view that humans should have dominion over animals. Also, cats were very active at night and engaged in loud, raucous mating rituals. Though cats had always behaved in this manner, to the superstitious minds of the Middle Ages, cats were practicing supernatural powers and witchcraft. Most accused witches were older peasant women who lived alone, often keeping cats as pets for companionship. This guilt by association meant that roughly a million cats were burned at the stake, along with their owners, on suspicion of being witches.
&gt;
&gt;In the early thirteenth century Pope Gregory IX (1145–1241) declared that a sect in southern France had been caught worshipping the devil. He claimed the devil had appeared in the form of a black cat. Cats became the official symbol of heresy (or religious beliefs not advocated by the church). Anyone who showed any compassion or feeling for a cat came under the church's suspicion. By the beginning of the fourteenth century, Europe's cat population had been severely depleted. Only semi-wild cats survived in many areas.
&gt;
&gt;In 1347 the bubonic plague swept across Europe. Called the Black Death, it killed twenty-five million people (nearly a third of Europe's population) in only three years. Thousands of farm animals died as well, either from the plague or from lack of care. The death rate peaked in the warm summer months and dropped dramatically in the wintertime because the plague was being spread to humans by fleas on infected rodents. The plague revisited Europe several more times over the next few centuries. In addition, millions of people are thought to have suffered from food poisoning during the Middle Ages because of the presence of rat droppings in the grain supply. Centuries of cat slaughter had allowed the rodent population to surge out of control.",False,2,,True,MoonPoint,True,1265399429,0,2,t5_2qh61,t3_ayh68,c0k1uz4,WTF,0

That you think the group ""black,"" as meant by English speaking America, has scientific significance.  It doesn't.  People who think it does generally are called racists.  

&gt;In a liberal area if I point out something that Blacks do better than Whites, people would agree; if I point out something Whites do better than Blacks, they would say I'm “racist”. 

Your liberal friends are making a mistake by agreeing with you.  For example, descendants of African slaves who spend 5-10 hours a day playing basketball from the time they are five tend to be more successful in the NBA than descendants of European colonists brought up playing soccer or baseball.  This is not scientific justification for saying ""blacks are better than whites at basketball.""  There was a time near the turn of the century when all the best basketball players were jewish kids from New York.  There was a wrongheaded belief that jewish people were somehow superior atheletes that went along with it.  

&gt;Australoid (Papuans, Australian Aborigines, groups in India, etc). 

Always thought they were part of the mongoloids, you may very well be right, though.  

&gt;However scientific research into this area has been suppressed, and people risk losing their careers or reputations, so they usually avoid it.

You've trailed into the passive voice.  Who's doing the suppressing?  By what means?

&gt;Nearly all the civilizations, inventions, and culture comes from the more pure and original groups, with the mixed groups copying the “parent” races' advances.

You're making a very broad claim based on anecdotal evidence.  And there are ready counter-anecdotes.  Take the Turks for example.  They happen to be tough as nails when it comes to fighting wars.  All the great ""Arab"" or ""Muslim"" military men of the last millenium were Turks.  Saladin was a Turk, his army were Turks.  In WW1 they may have lost their Arab colonies, but they fought off the toughest people in the history of mankind, the British Empire, and saved their independence.  

So, obviously, a question like this must be answered by very detailed scientific inquiry.  

&gt;The more pure people also seem to be viewed as the most beautiful (subjective, but it still has merit).

The only science I'm aware of on that subject says people whose facial features are most in accordance with the golden ratio (phi=1.616...) are seen as the most beutiful.  Things like skin color, hair color, eye color and whatnot do not affect the perception.  

&gt;It is possible for the advantages to be inherited yes; it could go either way with inheriting the advantages or disadvantages, but I haven't read anything on whether one is actually more likely to occur than the other so I can't say for certain.

That's sort of the rub of things.   

&gt;So many people proclaim to support “diversity”, but in reality what they're supporting is the genocide of our unique and diverse races, ethnicities and cultures in favor of a bland, mediocre and homogenous race of humans. Real diversity is what we have, distinct races, ethnicities and cultures; all of which should be protected, preserved and kept as pure as possible so that each one can continue evolving and advancing in their own right.

I think you misunderstand biology.  There's a line in a movie called Bullworth where Warren Beaty says ""We need to start fucking until we're all the same color.""  You seem to think that would be a bad thing.  Well, rest your heart at ease:  Even if we all started fucking we wouldn't end up the same color.  The human race would become infinitely more diverse than it is now, with a long continueum of appearences.  It would take highly controlled breeding, draconian government enforcement that people of certain heritage mate to produce offspring with a predesired tribal make-up, for us to all end up the same color.

No, there are terrorists who threaten to kill them. They still have the right to do whatever they want under the state, hell, some even get state protection.

No, not really. Depends on the hadith of course, but fundamentally Jihad is only to be used in defense of the Ummah.

&gt; Can you claim and justify, therefore, that Muslims in non-Sharia states are not enemies of the state?

&gt; Emotional attachment to the imperial system on the other hand, can safely be ignored in favor of the metric system's above benefits.

The metric system has little benefit over the imperial system.  The factor of 10 thing could easily be replicated in the imperial system; just measure everything in microinches, kilogallons, etc.  The Mars mission didn't fail because of a problem converting feet to miles.  It failed because of a problem converting pounds to Newtons.  The advantage of the metric system is that the whole rest of the world uses it.

We could define everything based off of Planck units (but make the 10^0 unit something macroscopic).  But no one would use pseduo-Plackian units even if they were superior because of the change-over cost.

&gt;In any case, you'd have to prove one language to be superior to all the others in efficiency, ease-of-mastery, and lack of intellectual barriers inherent to it, before you could choose one that you wanted all people to learn.

You don't need to demonstrate that one system is better than the other.  You just demonstrate that the status quo (two systems) is worse than the target (one system, which ever it may be).

&gt;There are hundreds of languages currently in use on this planet, and you can't just convince people to change over, as most of them have an emotional attachment to their first language.

It's not just emotional attachment.  It's very *expensive* to train people to speak multiple languages.  People in Europe are more likely to invest in learning multiple languages than people in the US because the former interact with several languages on a routine basis.  In the US, you can drive 1000 miles in every direction without needing anything but English.  It has nothing to do with Americans being more emotionally attached to English.

You are absolutely right that the people who need to be taking the stairs are the ones in the elevator. The problem is the incredibly easy access to the elevator, or the scootercart at Walmart, or the moving sidewalk, or whatever. My point is that if we can just 'tweak' things so that taking the stairs is the 'easier' or 'cheaper' decision, a lot more people would take the stairs. There are lots of ways to do this: Make the elevator inconvient to get to, make it only available for handicapped individuals, make it cost 25 cents, [make walking up the stairs fun](http://www.break.com/usercontent/2009/10/music-stairs-1463936.html)! 

Similarly, if we made [options for people who sit at a desk all day to be active](http://www.treadmill-desk.com/) available and socially-acceptable (I think right not a low of the patients I see would raise their eyebrows if I were to get a treadmill desk and invite them to walk with me while we talk about their child, sadly), people would be more active at their desks! 

If we designed communities *that people wanted to live in* where residents could actually get places they wanted to go by walking rather than driving, and made driving expensive and inconvient (e.g., raise gas taxes, or limit parking), people would walk more - right now the town I live in, like a lot of towns nowadays, doesn't even have sidewalks! 

And if *convenient, high calorie* food cost less and was easier to prepare than a package of mac &amp; cheese (fruit does not have very many calories; meat takes a while to cook and is certainly more expensive), then people would buy food that is better for them. If we encouraged people go home for lunch - e.g., adopted a more Southern European attitude towards the midday meal - people would also be more likely to go home and prepare something nutritious rather than nuking yet another Hungry Man Dinner disaster.

Oh really.

Then how do you explain the Crusades? The Spanish Inquisition? Conversion or death for the natives of the Americas when the Spaniards and Portuguese arrived in the New World? Biblical defense of Western slavery?

At what point, exactly, did our civilization stop ""forming""? Where exactly are you drawing the line between uncivilized and civilized? Because *everywhere you would draw that line, I can and will find a religious atrocity that came afterward*.

Furthermore, you appear to have completely ignored the part where I said these atrocities were depicted *favorably*. You do not seem to appreciate the implications of that. Let us take the war crimes of Moses, for example, where he sent in his armies to slaughter whole cities, save for the young women who were gang raped and/or enslaved. Traditional Christian doctrine holds that these atrocities are acceptable *because God ordered Moses to do those things*. God cannot order an immoral act.

It's also very insulting to the Jews to basically characterize their Torah as a work in progress. But you are clearly very comfortable with such a bold implication.

&gt;Religion or should I say ethics, helped in lessening that.

Bullshit. I just told you what Biblical ""ethics"" are. Biblical ethics are little more than doing what this god tells you to do, or else.

Let me tell you about ethics and morality. It's about doing the right thing even when no one is going to notice or care. It's about doing the right thing even when the wrong thing would have a much greater reward. It's about knowing *why* the wrong thing is wrong and the right thing is right. The Bible does not really teach these things. The Bible tells me to follow orders. The Bible tells me to be obedient. There is no illumination or lessen there. I've gotten better advice from a fortune cookie.

&gt;Imagine if people continued fighting and went down the Darwinian path. We'd have multiple Hitlers and our species would have likely went extinct.

We *have* had multiple Hitlers. They wore the robes of the Catholic Church when they sent armies of soldiers and civilians to sweep through Europe even before they reached Jerusalem fight the Saracens over control of the city during the Crusades. Tens of thousands of Jews were killed by French zealots roaming the countryside as they headed south and east.

To say nothing of what the Crusaders did to the city in 1066.

They wore the robes of the Catholic Church when they accepted hundreds of slaves from Hispaniola, who were sent across the Atlantic back to Europe in the belly of a ship where hundreds more of them died of starvation and disease before they arrived.

There were an estimated 100 million people living in the Americas when Columbus landed. 300,000 on Hispaniola alone. That island was wiped clean within a few years. Its people were killed, tortured, mutilated, and infected with disease.

They stood in the Oval Office of the White House when they declared the doctrine of Manifest Destiny: that God wanted the United States to stretch From Sea to Shining Sea, never mind that the land was already occupied by millions of people. They ordered their armies to slaughter defenseless civilians when they refused to leave their ancestral homes. And they wore the cloak of supernatural edict to protect themselves from the spray of blood and guts.

And speaking of Hitler in particular, let me offer you [a choice quote](http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/quotes_hitler.html):

&gt;“My feeling as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded only by a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was his fight against the Jewish poison. Today, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to shed his blood upon the Cross. As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice. And as a man I have the duty to see to it that human society does not suffer the same catastrophic collapse as did the civilization of the ancient world some two thousand years ago — a civilization which was driven to its ruin through this same Jewish people.

&gt;“Then indeed when Rome collapsed there were endless streams of new German bands flowing into the Empire from the North; but, if Germany collapses today, who is there to come after us? German blood upon this earth is on the way to gradual exhaustion unless we pull ourselves together and make ourselves free!

&gt;“And if there is anything which could demonstrate that we are acting rightly, it is the distress that daily grows. For as a Christian I have also a duty to my own people. And when I look on my people I see them work and work and toil and labor, and at the end of the week they have only for their wages wretchedness and misery. When I go out in the morning and see these men standing in their queues and look into their pinched faces, then I believe I would be no Christian, but a very devil, if I felt no pity for them, if I did not, as did our Lord two thousand years ago, turn against those by whom today this poor people are plundered and exploited.”

Was he actually a Christian? *It doesn't matter*. He was able to use Christian doctrine to lead Germany into war.

(The passages you cite I don't find particularly apalling--how is it antisemitic or controversial at all to assert that the Jews have distinct interests?  Isn't that a truism?)  Apparently he's also a holocaust denier and has been linked to neo-nazism.  Whoops!  Wasn't expecting that!  Looks like I picked the wrong historian!  (What does a neo-nazi gain from arguing against the US dropping of the atomic bombs?)

But let's not fall for an ad hominem here.  He could still be right on this issue; I'd argue he is.  He cited many historians throughout the piece, and surely not all of them are crack-pots.

[Gar Alperovitz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gar_Alperovitz):
&gt;Although Japanese peace feelers had been sent out as early as September 1944 (and [China's] Chiang Kai-shek had been approached regarding surrender possibilities in December 1944), the real effort to end the war began in the spring of 1945. 

Okay, the scholasticism of this Alperovitz character has been called into question on precisely this issue.  I'm not sure why he would lie, but it's worth bearing in mind that he's at least been accused of it.

Next up is [Walter Trohan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Trohan) who, according to the article, ""revealed that on January 20, 1945, two days prior to his departure for the Yalta meeting with Stalin and Churchill, President Roosevelt received a 40-page memorandum from General Douglas MacArthur outlining five separate surrender overtures from high-level Japanese officials.""  The Chicago Tribune seems to acknowledge an [article with a headline](http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/475703002.html?dids=475703002:475703002&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Aug+19,+1945&amp;author=WALTER+TROHAN&amp;pub=Chicago+Daily+Tribune+\(1872-1963\)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=1&amp;desc=BARE+PEACE+BID+U.+S.+REBUFFED+7+MONTHS+AGO) that amounts to as much.  How do you respond to this dossier?  The Japanese weren't enthusiastic enough in their entreaty for peace?  They needed to be nuked into submission?

Next cited is [Harry Barnes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Elmer_Barnes), also a holocaust denier with neo-nazi sympathies.  (What's up with all these holocaust deniers?  For the record, I am not a holcaust denier.)  Barnes claims that: ""The authenticity of the Trohan article was never challenged by the White House or the State Department...""  Can we accept the Trohan article as true or not?  Apparently its legitimacy is cast in doubt?  By whom?  Why would Trohan lie?

Edwin P. Hoyt:
&gt; The atomic bomb is indeed a fearsome weapon, but it was not the cause of Japan's surrender, even though the myth persists even to this day.

Dennis D. Waynstock: 

&gt;By April 1945, Japan's leaders realized that the war was lost. Their main stumbling block to surrender was the United States' insistence on unconditional surrender. They specifically needed to know whether the United States would allow Hirohito to remain on the throne. They feared that the United States would depose him, try him as a war criminal, or even execute him ...

&gt;Unconditional surrender was a policy of revenge, and it hurt America's national self-interest. It prolonged the war in both Europe and East Asia, and it helped to expand Soviet power in those areas.

Are *all* of these accounts biased?  *All* of them baseless?

Now, why don't you provide an inscrutable source demonstrating that the Japanese were hell bent on forcing the Americans into a land invasion?  That they offered absolutely no hope for a peaceful resolution?  And even if they were unwilling to submit to an unconditional surrender--so what?  We had incapacitated their military machine.  They were no longer an imminent threat.  Why the urgency?  Why not let them stew over their options and let them come to their senses without the application of violence on our part?  Come now, let's see you provide an inscrutable source for all this.

The way I see things, the US government and military had an incentive to use Japan in order to make a point to the world.  This is something that is often done in history--and still done today.

The last *real* economic upturn we had was after WWII, and it was fueled by political changes (don't pretend it had anything to do with ""wartime full employment""); when your country emerges as a superpower and the entire world decides that your currency is the medium of choice for trade, it causes a bit of a windfall to the producers in that country. The US was nouveau-riche. So what did we do? We spent. We spent on programs to increase the quality of life; we spent on nifty gadgets to amuse ourselves; occasionally we even did something sensible and spent on infrastructure that might actually pay back in the long run. We spent more than we could produce for ourselves, but that was cool -- everyone knew that the dollar was as good as gold, and the US wasn't in danger of disappearing before we could make good on our promises, so the credit was forthcoming.

What couldn't be foreseen was that this would continue indefinitely. Everyone knows that if you get into debt, unless it was to buy something that makes you money, then you need to have a lean period later on while you repay the debt. Buying on credit is a way of taking from your future self -- you get to have something today, but you have to give something up tomorrow, and the next day, until the loan is repaid, to make your payments. Postwar Americans never really could get behind this concept; they thought it was a real bummer. So we just kept on spending our *future* production because hey, Social Security is nice, and electronics are nifty, and having a house out in the country is awesome! And who cares that the portion of the economy that goes to just paying interest is on the rise? More credit is always forthcoming!

And there's a fiction among the ""civilized"" nations of the west that this is the way it should be, and will continue indefinitely, when it was really a fluke. Now we live in a world with the EU and Japan and India and China and a progressive (more or less) Middle East and a modernizing Africa and even the *existence* of superpowers is in question; the US makes less and less of anything the world wants, and buys more and more...

Basically, in the long run, we're deep in a hole, digging deeper, and the only ways out are another major political upheaval (with results impossible to predict), or massive devaluation of the dollar.

*With one bottle of whine and counting I should be posting this to /r/Drunk.*

Because how it works is that, say 1 billion is create by the fed and loaned to the banks. (And that is the only place where US$ can come from. Yes, that money in your wallet, the money the US owes to china, everything.)

These banks have to pay interest on that, money they take from the people/companies they lend their money to. The interest is there, for one part, to control the value of the money. (If you could just go there and take whatever you want without having to pay anything for it, money would loose it's value quickly.)

The problem now is, at some point the first dollar was created by the Fed and given into circulation. It went to the banks, from there as a loan to a company which payed someones salary. However that first $ already had interest attached to it, which must be payed back. 

And there is only one place where that additional money, from the fed, as a loan, with interest.

So there is simply too much money floating around, generating a HUGE amount of interest that is to be payed back to the fed. (And the moment you suck ""Fuck it, I am just not paying that money back"" the dollar will loose it's value. You're broke.)

When this system was invented they saw a big problem with political influence. The idea was to prevent politicans from screwing around with the value of the money just to win an election. So the fed, and any bank running the fiat system, is exempt from government regulations.

Ok, so now money is generated with dept attached to it, to control it's worth. The question now is, what happens with this additional dept?

Here in europe the situation is that the interest money flows back into the national budget of the different countries.
We build roads and schools from it, so to speak.

In the U.S. it's a bit different. Any private bank must hold a certain amount of their capitalization in shares of Fed. That % is the minimum.

This is also where the returns from the interest goes to. (Yes, by proxy it's banks sucking their own cocks and we're the jizz, or paying for the blow and hookers and the rest of that party, or something like that.)

Where it gets into the realms of conspiracy theories is when you start asking the questions ""Who owns the most of the fed?"" or ""So what happens when you, as a bank, buy more than the minimum of the fed?""

The base line is that there are two things happening here, people that are not elected are wielding power over your country with private interests (although it's only one part of puzzle, compared to the lobbying going on) on the bright side nobody can afford to just drop the dollar. Not the bank, China or whomever.

So there is no big clash right ahead, however on the long run, just bringing more money faster into play gets you closer to the point where the system breaks down. (Because of the dept there will, at some point and in theory, 1'000'000 dollar bills that you use to pay for, say, bread.)

1426206327,0,t3_ayh68,,t1_c0k2lvf,,"You make many good points, but I have some things to add. First, there is little recorded violence against Jews in the HRE until the time of the crusades. Though there was negative feeling toward them, as you say, because of usury laws, this did not translate into violence until around the 11th century. 

Second, I've never heard of Germans blaming Jews for corruption in the catholic church, though there was much blame put on Jews for the bubonic plague, which surfaced periodically beginning in the 1340s around the time you seem to be talking about in point 3.

Third, Jews were either expelled from or massacred in many German cities beginning about this time in the 14th and 15th centuries and continuing until the beginning of the Reformation. Thus, by the 16th century, most Jews who still remained in Germany lived in the countryside. This leads me to my next point:

Fourth, antisemitism after the Napoleonic Wars was largely a result of Jews moving back into cities now that they were allowed to do so. As you said, you had to condense a lot of history into a small space, but I think it is a big mistake to say hatred of Jews was a simple displacement of Catholic/Protestant tensions. 

Fifth, when you say ""the German people blamed the Jews for undermining the war effort"" you are using quite a broad brush. Again, I understand more as I write this your point about condensing history, but a large part of the German population blamed their performance in the war on other factors. 

Sixth, your point number seven contains the most controversial material of your statement. Historians dispute to what extent antisemitism was a factor in Hitler's election to chancellor. I tend to believe that people accepted it as a traditional part of right wing politics in Germany, and didn't give it much thought, voting for Hitler for other reasons. Also, one must keep in mind that despite his broad support, many of the people thrown into concentration camps were non-Jewish opponents of the Nazis, like Socialists and Communists. 

Finally, it was not only revenge that motivated the Nazi Party's actions against the Jews of Europe. They sincerely thought that the Jewish ""race"" (not religion, and here is where things are different in 1941 as opposed to 1348) was corrupting the German ""race."" It was an insane, biologically racist idea that led to the Holocaust, and although this may have had roots in the long history of anti-Jewishness in Germany, it was distinctly different. This is important for the moral lesson of WWII in Europe, which proves biological racism's fallacy. ",False,6,,False,rob_jeebs,True,1265425525,0,6,t5_2qh61,t1_c0k26rc,c0k2lvf,WTF,0

Half of all of the Christians in the world (roughly a billion people) are Catholic, and most of them are moderate (apart from, say, African ones but that may be due to a lack of education, not self-inflicted ignorance). The American south is a sad anomaly, but as a whole Christianity isn't that crazy, nor has it been since the reformation. If you look at Europe, a vast majority of the Christians there are moderates, and they embrace secular ideas. Even among Christianity the American evangelism is frowned upon. 

I was raised in Canada, a relatively moderate country. The Christians I've seen are often as progressive and irreligious as agnostics. When I was younger, I've never heard of someone refusing scientific truths like evolution before until I read about it on the web. The whole idea seemed shocking to me.

Only in the Anglo-western sphere is Global warming a left vs right issue. For the rest of the world it is rich vs poor. Developed Nations vs. Emerging Economies. IP/Technology rights holders vs Product Producers that they run deficits with.

The capacity for developed economies with their ~3% economic growth rates to increase carbon output is far less than a country that does not have a fully formed industrial base, which is growing at 9-12%. Indonesia alone has 250 million people (to the US's 300 million), what happens if in 50-60 years they develop on par to the US? Not to mention the billions of India and China. The US economy, and even that of Europe would be dwarfed. Meanwhile these economies are running trade deficits to the developing and emerging economies, because they buy more cheap products that those economies buy services and technology from the Western Nations. What is the power elite in the developed nations to do?

Climate treaties do two things, 1) they stifle the development of the emerging economies more than western economies, maintaining the Wests dominance, 2) require emerging/developing nations to buy IP and technology from the west, offsetting the trade imbalance that the west has with the emerging economies. Basically it creates demand for all the ""knowledge"" the ""knowledge economies"" have.

I grant that I have a working belief that gravity will be here tomorrow, but that is a personal position, not a scientific one.

As far as using the past to prove the future, you may be interested in [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability). Until the arrival of whites in Australia, European people could be certain the on waking the day would not present a black swan.

&gt;Can you say the same about climate ""science"", given that it is a field that has never been studied in the past and is still in its infancy with respect to the myriad inputs and results that influence earth's climate?

It is less certain than gravity for me, yes, but not less than other branches of 'science' that commonly used, notably economics.

Amongst the excess of words you've used, you mention an increase in cloud cover from increased temperatures. Do you have any evidence that higher absolute humidity with increased temperatures (interesting that you accept it here) will result in increased cloud cover? Clouds require cool air for the water to condense.

&gt;All I ask is that you prove to me beyond a reasonable doubt that catastrophe is the ONLY possible outcome from increased CO2 emission, and do so by showing historical proof of just such an event occurring on earth in the past.

Beyond a reasonable doubt is a legal test and is not relevant here. Not only that, you challenge is ridiculous, both because the past is not necessarily a good indicator of the future and particularly the absence of events in the past does not predict their absence in the future - a case in point is that you have most probably not died in the past, but you are pretty certain to be mortal.

&gt;As best as I can tell, life has existed on earth for several billion years through much more dire times than these, 

Try 3.5-4By, with the vast majority of that time not including complex organisms (green plant photosynthesis only started 1.2Bya).

&gt;and I suspect that humanity will prove to be better than dinosaurs at dealing with future changes.

That's my point; we've just discovered that there's an ocean of study we call ""climate science""... we are as of yet very far from finding Australia let alone Bouvet Island.  Perhaps as climate science matures, my opinion of it will change but for now, it is far too fledling for me to invest heavily in.  

&gt;Do you have any evidence that higher absolute humidity with increased temperatures (interesting that you accept it here) will result in increased cloud cover? Clouds require cool air for the water to condense.

The air is always pretty damn cool at 20000 feet, so I'm not overly concerned about CO2 hampering condensation.  Clouds don't form at sea level with any regularity outside of London.  Shit, most hurricanes develop at the equator between the Amazon and the Sahara, so I'm gonna venture that your argument is invalid.  

I have never said that I don't accept that earth may be warming, because only a fool would suggest that earth ought to have an absolute mean temperature given how wildly the climate has fluctuated throughout history.  

My argument has always been that the results of mankind's influence on global climate are yet unknown and given the law of unintended consequences (proven by that other ""science"" you mentioned, namely economics), it would not surprise me if burning fossil fuels in fact causes the world to COOL in the long term.  We just have no way of knowing how earth will respond because we have no previous history of industrialized, fuel-burning humanity to judge by.  The Romans, for all their might, couldn't even deforest Germany for crying out loud.  

Surely you could be right and I could be wrong, but can't we at least agree that the oceans a century from now will still be about where they are today?  Can't we at least agree that Norwegians will still vacation in Thailand rather than sit under a palm tree on Oslo beach?

The cardinal rules are as follows: Wherever all of the tourists go, you don't go.

If you're in Paris, take a walk around the Latin district, and explore a bit. One time when I was in Paris, wandering around the Latin district late at night with some friends, we saw several large groups of well-dressed Parisians walk into an unmarked building, one of the countless old buildings, but this one was slightly unique. We asked the next group of people heading in a few minutes later, what was going on in the building, and they said that there was a very obscure but high-class and exquisite restaurant in the basement of the building. We went in and they were *not* kidding. This place was amazing, we got some of the best food in Paris, and it was in an old wine cellar, and there was a man playing a violin and another man on a piano. It was incredibly cool and was one of the highlights of my trip France. When in Rome, grab some gellato and walk around the old parts of the city at night, admire the fountains and scenery, those kinds of moments are what turn ""trips"" into truly amazing adventures.

Eastern Europe -- Estonia, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, etc.  I would wander around, live on a shoestring budget, hike around in the woods, attempt to get laid, and purchase escort services when I don't succeed.

Chile -- ditto the above, combined with taking an epic trek through Patagonia and making sure to catch sight of some penguins.

Kazakhstan, Turkey and Mongolia seem interesting too, although I'm not exactly sure what I would do there -- probably more of the same.
