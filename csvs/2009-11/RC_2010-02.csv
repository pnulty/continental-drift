Today I tried this in a parking lot:

It is true that if you turn your key only one position you can still drive the car without power steering or powerbreaking, but if you turn it two positions then everything shuts down and anitheft protection locks the steering wheel.

I'm worried that people going at high speeds may turn the key one position too much and thus ending up with a locked steering wheel at 120 KMH.

From what I know almost all cars over here (Europe/Spain), do have this Lock protection. 

Now, Would the same happen at high speeds? Maybe the car has a way to detect if you're driving too fast and therefor disable the lockup. Yet I wonder if that's likely with all the electronics shut down.",,False,4,,False,DanielTaylor,True,1265021046,0,4,t5_2qqjc,t1_c0jqcyc,c0jryan,0,todayilearned

Speculating what would have happened if US didn't exist at all is in my opinion a bit too far-reaching. Let's leav history behind and think of world where US would be neutral. Like before the WWII.

Europe countries have no guts after WWII. Germans, even though they could mount quite an impressive military force, are so afraid of the past that they wouldn't do anything. French are worried about their own security and the only ones that would do something about Taiwan would be Brits who have however out-stretched their military might.

Eastern Europe would fall under the power of Russia, China would be way more aggressive and have lot larger country than now. Human rights would be forgotten.

Even though many, very many people all over the world hate US and their imperialist methods, I can't figure out any preferable alternatives. Yes, in a perfect world every country would deal with their own problems and trade wouldn't be based on politics but that's not going to happen anytime soon.

As I live in Estonia, formerly occupied by USSR I feel much safer knowing that Russia wouldn't dare to attack us and I belive Taiwanese feel about the same.

US politics aren't fair to all but life never is and they have to respect human rights to at least some degree. Something similar to Tiananmen Square massacre couldn't possibly happen in the US we know today and that means more to me than always treating everybody equally.

Now, people in Afganistan and Iraq would probably disagree and I somewhat agree to them but it is very difficult for me to trade my own freedom and happiness to that of Iraqis. Besides, they had quite awful living conditions even before US invasion. And yes, I can almost always find exuses for my questionable morals :) Sorry about that.

However, population studies have been done on Askhenazi Jews. Here are two for now.
http://www.pnas.org/content/97/12/6769
&gt;The “among populations” variance component (ΦST) for the Ashkenazi, Roman, North African, Near Eastern, Kurdish, and Yemenite Jews (the lowest ΦST value of the five population groups analyzed in Table 2) indicated that these Jewish populations were not significantly different from one another.

There's also [this MDS graph](http://www.pnas.org/content/97/12/6769/F2.large.jpg) which uses the frequencies of Y-chromosome haplotypes to map clusters of genetic affinity. You'll see the Ashkenazi datum point is clustered with other Jewish populations.

&gt;Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that Diaspora Jews from Europe, Northwest Africa, and the Near East resemble each other more closely than they resemble their non-Jewish neighbors. 
...
&gt;Our results indicated a relatively minor contribution of European Y chromosomes to the Ashkenazim. {...} The extremely close affinity of Jewish and non-Jewish Middle Eastern populations observed here (Tables 2 and 3) supports the hypothesis of a common Middle Eastern origin

[PDF - Go to Page 6 of paper](http://www.familytreedna.com/pdf/43026_Doron.pdf)

The study looks at two haplo-groups that are overrepresented in a frequency comparison between Ashkenazi Jews and western Eurasian populations. Then by comparing the Ashkenazi mtDNA sequences within the two haplo-groups against other mtDNA sequences from the same groups, you can infer when and when the Askhenazi population was founded.

So the study concludes that over half of all Ashkenazis have one of four sequenced mtDNA sequences in those haplogroups that have a likely Near Eastern ancestry. This is important while we know the historical expansion of Ashkenazi Jews started in the Rhine river basin, we don't know where the population was actually established.

&gt;Likewise,the distribution of HgN1b in southwestern Asia and North
Africa (Rando et al. 1998;Richard set al. 2000) supports a Near Eastern, rather than a European, origin for this Hg.It is noteworthy that our extensive sample set from the Caucasus (table5) does not offer any hint that the four dominant Ashkenazi mtDNA lineages might have arrived from this region.

They saw me coming but did not make any accommodation for me. I got as far on the side of the bridge as I could without turning sideways, but they still didn't give me any space. So I just ran right into one of the bitches. Her entire gaggle began cursing me in Italian, ""maleducato"", etc. I didn't give a fuck. To me, they were the rude ones.

And no, these weren't 100 year old women, they were in their sixties, definitely young enough to give a young nigger his space.

1426201960,0,,t3_aw23x,t1_c0jtcf9,"By ""liberal"" I assume you mean liberal in the sense of laissez-faire markets, similar to the British Liberal party before the rise of Labour, during the 19th century. If I am wrong, please correct me. If yes though, then surely you must support the French or any other revolution that occurred in support of liberal (bourgeois) democracy. Historically speaking, those revolutions occurred because interests of the ascendent class, capitalists, came into direct conflict with those of the old order, the feudal aristocracy. Without those revolutions, the peasantry would have never been freed from the land or tithe, and as such, could not develop into the working class. Those revolutions were progressive in character. They brought greater freedoms and (near) universal suffrage to the masses. Ergo, without said revolutions, global capitalism, markets, and for that matter, the modern world, could not exist.

&gt; I'm for incremental changes

Incremental, e.g. parliamentary change, in the long run, is ineffective--that's why revolutions have a tendency to occur over and over. Typically, serious and necessary legislative reform only occurs due to the threat of revolution. The *threat* of violence through militant action is merely the impetus of change in those circumstances. George Lansbury, MP and leader of Labour from 1932-35, went as far as saying that the The Unemployment Insurance Act 1920 was ""not so much to safeguard the lives of men and their families but, as Lord Derby had recently told them, to forestall revolution"". Men in the army were included among the insured, because at the time, the government was not quite sure whether they would turn their rifles in the direction desirable to the government. That's merely one of many historical examples.

Besides, if you think I am acting as some sort of apologist for the Stalinist dictatorships of Eastern Europe, or elsewhere for that matter, you are mistaken.

Middle east would explode being the main oil source and Africa.. well.. diamond, coal, uranium, you get my drift.

What we're seeing right now is China showing off its newly acquired muscle against a the current superpower and testing its boundaries. It's a diplomatic move where they gnaw as the US international supremacy while trying to force them to make a stupid move so that they can turn back to the rest of the planet and say  ""Look, the bully is being mean to me!!"". It's a strategy the US is not accustomed to fight so well since they've been used to be on top of a pedestal and it will take them some time for them to adjust but eventually they will.

Finally the ""war"" is already on, but this time it's economical and cultural. The best move for the US/west would be an heart and mind campaign on a planetary scale. Unfortunately the US starts with a large handicap and the mindset of a dominant bully used to make himself respected with tomahawk and embargos.

Lincoln freed the slaves, Washington won a defining moment in history, and Teddy Roosevelt gave this as his foreign policy speech:

&gt; There must be no effort made to remove the mote from our brother's eye if we refuse to remove the beam from our own. But in extreme cases action may be just)fiable and proper. What form the action shall take must depend upon the circumstances of the case; that is, upon the degree of the atrocity and upon our power to remedy it.

I suppose you could say that Teddy Roosevelt committed atrocities toward Cuba, which he stated along with Panama and other countries in the foreign policy speech, but I couldn't find anything definite. Maybe you're talking about the Spanish-American war and the Rough Riders? Whatever happened, he wasn't a president then and it was a war.

&gt;  the United States seized the area from the Lakota tribe after the Great Sioux War of 1876-77. The Treaty of Fort Laramie from 1868 had previously granted the Black Hills to the Lakota in perpetuity. Members of the American Indian Movement led an occupation of the monument in 1971, naming it ""Mount Crazy Horse"".

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rushmore

&gt; At the outset of the project, Gutzon Borglum had persuaded South Dakota state historian Doane Robinson the presidents would give the work national significance, rejecting Robinson's initial suggestion that the sculpture honor the West's greatest heroes, both Native Americans and pioneers.

Hand-tailored within three days to my exact measurements and customization specifications, three to four fittings, top notch material.  It's all a joy to wear.  The suits were $160 each (so a bit more than 100 euros).  Many Asian tailors will try to rip you off, trying to talk you into buying a suit with two or even one fitting sessions.

$1100 wouldn't even buy a pair of fully bespoke trousers of the same quality and materials in Europe (high-end tailors will charge around $5k for a full suit).  Until now, I'd thought the suits I'd bought when I started working for about the same as the whole clothing package (which I intend to have for years) were a great deal, super well fitting, comfortable, etc., but man...never again.

The downside is that if you want a well-cut suit, you really have to know what you're looking for.  I can go into Brooks Brothers and buy a Golden Fleece outfit, and I know it'll be well stitched, have great Super 180 wool, and generally last forever.  I can judge on the spot if a jacket fits reasonably well, and that's that; if it breaks, I bring it back and they fix it for me.

Ignorance is why young women strap bombs on their bodies and teenage boys can beat to death another young boy tied to a fence.

In the christian missionaries' boarding schools, orphanages, and medical clinics, wide spread abuses included murder, sexual abuse, being sold into slavery,  forced feeding of vomit and feces, other forms of torture, and severe beatings.   All christian faith missionaries usually establish an association in one or several villages to form a critical mass of whites to educate their own children, purchase food, share transportation, and form a common defense if the locals have a problem with any of the missionaries.  I knew some missionaries who operated in Africa in the 1960s as part of such an association; they were unhappy with the RCC priest.  He would select a beautiful child to accompany him on his monthly trips to see his superiors.  When he returned to the village, the child who left with him never returned, and there were no accusations or questions.  Just another black child disappeared in Africa under the charge of a white missionary -- no one cared.  The other missionaries kept their mouths shut about their suspicions (sexual abuse, followed by selling into slavery) because most of them had evil baggage, and if all were exposed, the African government would expel them all.  According to KW Daniels, all christian faiths have evil missionaries, not just the RCC.

There is ugliness to be found, like the Crusades, gay-bashing, or protesting outside abortion clinics. But there is also beauty, like the thousands of songs and works of art, the compassion of thousands of people working for charities and the bloodless democratic revolutions in Eastern Europe in 1989, largely organized by churches. 

But as many redditors have already pointed out, all Christians pick and choose the peices of the Bible that they want to follow. Evangelicals take the bits about not having pre-marital sex and sodomy and ignore the parts about giving away all your worldly goods. Liberal churches embrace the parts about charity and giving, but ignore the nastier bits.

I have a friend who I think is the only real Christian I have ever met. She did all the things a Christian in America is supposed to do to be a part of the community: go to church, be a part of a Bible study group, abstain from pre-marital sex, listen to Christian rock, all of that. 

But the hypocrisy so many redditors in this thread are complaining about is totally absent in her. She lived the life I think Jesus would have wanted people to live. While in college, she spent almost every weekend distributing clothes and food to the homeless. She spent her spring breaks volunteering in post-Katrina New Orleans, and she paid her own airfare to get there. Last year, she sold/gave away all of her worldly possessions except for a hatchback, her laptop and some clothes and is currently traveling the United States volunteering for a variety of causes. 

My wife asked her once. ""Do you think homosexuality is a sin?"" Most of our friends are gay, and my wife and I marched in favor of a recent ballot measure supporting gay marraige, so we're pretty pro-gay. 

She responded, ""Well, yeah... but so are a lot of things I do. I still tell lies and all that. No one is perfect. Who am I to judge a gay person for what they do? That's not my place.""

Why can't more Christians be like her, following Jesus's word the best you can in your own life, but not forcing others to do the same?",,False,2,,False,jonsayer,True,1265128592,0,2,t5_2qh1i,t3_ax4b1,c0juqml,0,AskReddit

Something that would ease their progression and take some of the heat out of the flames directed against them from Israel (and vice versa).  It would mean Israel wouldn't have the PR nightmare of aid going through it; controlling Gaza's ports and airspace and it would mean the blockade would end at midnight of the agreement.  I don't see any reason why trade routes shouldn't pass through EU member Cyprus.  Greece, Britain and Cyprus certainly wouldn't have economic issue with it.

Don't make mistake; Israel's Arab population would swell with European Arabs just as Palestine swelled with Jewish immigrants before Israel's declaration of independence.

Mr Berlusconi: If Israel wants to join either the EU or the EEA then it would quickly become either an Arab majority, and with it no longer being able to claim to be a Jewish state, or dumping democracy - which in itself would get it excluded.

&gt;Research Octane Number (RON)
The most common type of octane rating worldwide is the Research Octane Number (RON). RON is determined by running the fuel in a test engine with a variable compression ratio under controlled conditions, and comparing the results with those for mixtures of iso-octane and n-heptane.
[edit] Motor Octane Number (MON)

&gt;There is another type of octane rating, called Motor Octane Number (MON), or the aviation lean octane rating, which is a better measure of how the fuel behaves when under load as it is done at 900 rpm instead of the 600 rpm of the RON[2][3]. MON testing uses a similar test engine to that used in RON testing, but with a preheated fuel mixture, a higher engine speed, and variable ignition timing to further stress the fuel's knock resistance. Depending on the composition of the fuel, the MON of a modern gasoline will be about 8 to 10 points lower than the RON. Normally, fuel specifications require both a minimum RON and a minimum MON.[citation needed]
[edit] Anti-Knock Index (AKI)

&gt;In most countries, including all of those of Australia and Europe the ""headline"" octane rating shown on the pump is the RON, but in Canada, the United States and some other countries,[which?] the headline number is the average of the RON and the MON, called the Anti-Knock Index (AKI). It may also sometimes be called the Road Octane Number (RdON), Pump Octane Number (PON), or (R+M)/2.
[edit] Difference between RON and AKI

&gt;Because of the 8 to 10 point difference noted above, the octane rating shown in the United States is 4 to 5 points lower than the rating shown elsewhere in the world for the same fuel. See the table in the following section for a comparison.

Then he has to pay a little under hundred Euro for his medical insurance, another twenty as broadcasting fees and no idea how much for his car insurance.

So far, none of these things are optional and must be paid by everybody. Only now do we start adding things like train tickets or fuel, electricity and heating bills, food and so forth, most of which are significantly higher than in the US. There are some cheap things too, like French wine, but compared to 1.35 Euro/litre you spend on fuel or 7 Euro (reducible by buying monthly tickets) for a one-way tram ticket to the office in suburbs, it doesn't really matter.

There's more than simply correlation to tie the historical emergence of humanism to Christianity, and here, again, the question of slave society is useful as a reference point.  The Christian doctrine of the soul led tended to make slavery a much stickier issue than it was in earlier European civilizations, precisely because it threw so much emphasis on individual responsibility and moral choice.  As a result, the dissolution of the Roman Empire signaled the end of main stream slavery in Europe, at least until the 15th century when the opening of reliable slave channels to Africa and the New World provided a strong economic impetus and the racial differential on which the Atlantic Slave Trade thrived.

In other words, the formal link noted by historians is that Christianity served as an ideological crucible in which the importance of the individual, not as an economic or social unit but as a moral agent, could grow.

Which is to say, not at all. Jesus as protagonist may as well have been named ""Joe Everyman"". The point of trying to make him into a physical person and deify him came later and I do believe misses the point of what the bible was trying to teach.

[Economy of ancient Greece](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Ancient_Greece)

-  The economy of ancient Greece was characterized by the extreme importance of importing goods, all the more so because of the relative poverty of Greece's soil. Beginning in the 6th century B.C., craftsmanship and commerce (principally maritime) developed and became increasingly more important in the classical period.

[Ancient Roman Economy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome#Economy)

-  Ancient Rome commanded a vast area of land, with tremendous natural and human resources. As such, Rome's economy remained focused on farming and trade. 

-  In manufacturing, production was on a relatively small scale, and generally consisted of workshops and small factories that employed at most dozens of workers. However, some brick factories employed hundreds of workers.

[Economy of England Starting at Medieval Times](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_England#History)

-  In medieval times (c. 11th–15th century), the wool trade was the major industry of England and the country exported wool to Europe. Many market towns and ports grew up on the industry

-  [more about export economy](http://www.jstor.org/pss/2593912)

[Economic history of the Ottoman Empire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_the_Ottoman_Empire)

-  The first is the classic era (enlargement), which comprised a closed agricultural economy, showing regional distinctions within the empire.

-  The Ottomans saw military expansion and fiscalism as the main source of wealth, with agriculture seen as more important than manufacture and commerce.[1] Western mercantilists gave more emphasis to manufacture and industry in the wealth-power-wealth equation, moving towards capitalist economics comprising expanding industries and markets whereas the Ottomans continued along the trajectory of territorial expansion, traditional monopolies, conservative land holding and agriculture

[The Ancient Assyrians](http://ancienthistory.suite101.com/article.cfm/the_ancient_assyrians#ixzz0eQaEOIUQ)

-  The fertile soil of the region allowed the Assyrians to have a booming farming economy. As the empire grew into new lands, other industries were explored and exploited, including mining and forestry.

[Egyptian Economy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt#Government_and_economy)

-  Farmers made up the bulk of the population

-  Artists and craftsmen were of higher status than farmers, but they were also under state control, working in the shops attached to the temples and paid directly from the state treasury.

-   Below the nobility were the priests, physicians, and engineers with specialized training in their field.

It was very tragic the state of affairs in Ireland where even tipping a waitress was a shockingly positive event. 

The general disconnect, I *think* exists, is that the EU nations (and others) have had a very long history with certain ""permissions"" being given to their citizenry. The cultures build with many neighbors knocking on their door. Let me pause there to flip over to the other side of the pond. Much of the US builds up an individual as a sovereign man. So long as he does not breech the property of his neighbor he is free to do as he wishes. So if he wants, he can dig a moat, paint his house plaid and sleep through the day. If he decides to play music at 1AM at maximum volume, that carries over to his neighbor's domain and thus a violation. So there the border exists. 

People in Europe have had to grow up living next door to one another and in response are likely to have (I can't prove it, so it's speculation) developed social norms of compromise lest they have a fight break out. (WW1 was fun that way). Certain things must be sacrificed for peace between neighbors.

So the ideal case of the US citizen permits him to do pretty much anything he wants within his own land's boundary while a person of the EU has to play a bit role in a larger show. 

Now in the US, you start having people who are exceeding their bounds. A particular person doesn't like something and pushes their will against others and we'll run with smoking because its easy. Second hand smoke drifts off into some other person's space - the smoker is violating their boundary. A law gets passed to assert that its a dick thing to do and they then have to lock it away within their homes. Fine by me. Then you have the same person that was justifiably offended pressing the matter on as a health concern - pushing for law that now breaks into the boundary of the person; here is where the ""threat"" of socialism enters. In the US, we'll get a particularly nasty flavor of Socialism (ideas are always going to be tainted with a culture's interpretation of expression) where laws will remove more and more of what a person can and cannot do as a function of the consequences involved with funding the systems that are created. 

A person who starts off with the ability to smoke his cigar on his property, so long as it does not affect others is then told he has to pay for something to benefit him and those around him. If he does not pay, his property is taken and he's jailed. So it's a do-or-die extreme that he reluctantly participates in. Then because of others like him, the costs involved with the system which we was thrust into go up. Cancer is a bitch it seems. So now the law extends its reach not only to his pocket book but now to a past time - healthy or not. 

The person from a country which has a tradition of exchange between neighbors for the social good can't really ""get this"" because they're used to it. 

I'm sorry this is so long-winded, but I think I might have expressed the issue properly. The short form is that with the US, the core of a person's freedoms are enshrined in his property. For socialism to work, the government must invade that property and consume it or else it has no power. (So if Health-care was opt-in you would have a huge imbalance).

1426203172,0,,t3_ax4b1,t1_c0jvwv1,"My honest opinion:

Christianity is simply one religion among many religions. There are so many religions today. There were many more in old times, which are not respected at all any more, and if you mention them (like Zeus, for example) people will laugh at the idea that they could ever be compared to supposedly deeper religions of today, like Christianity. But once they mattered to people every bit as much, and you can read it in the classics.

Religions rise and fall on their political associations, and they often have political content. Jesus got some of his appeal from opposition to Roman occupation; the Romans persecuted the Christians on a fundamentally political basis, driving Christianity's political success for a little while. Until Constantine (who killed his own relations horribly, and should never be spoken of as a good person) made Christianity the state religion and tore up Roman temples for patently political reasons. In Western Europe Christianity largely spread by Chieftains who were making similar political decisions, and by forcible conversions. Similar trends continued in South America. 

By the time we get to the official founding of the US, enlightenment thinking (cf. Voltaire's Candide) has established itself pretty well, and has a great deal of appeal to 13 religiously diverse colonies who see advantage in some form of association. And this a huge part of how the modern era of the West was formed, and things aren't all the same now in most of the west. But religion is still massively political, with the Republican party courting the ""religious vote"" (really encapsulating a collection of more-cultural-than-Biblical ideas, many of which are strongly political) - and the same blocs scratching Republican backs with official voting guides and so on. Guess what, they are publicly advocating for a theocracy. Well, what else is new? Religion is political. For all the spiritual posturing of religious people, the collections of beliefs which people get together to teach and reinforce direct violent force and the distribution of resources all the time. That is why Marx even cared about it (and he made his own religion, too).

If all this sounds decisively worldly, it is. What does it have to do with Yahweh? Well, who knows - what does it have to do with Apollo or Astarte, either?

So I believe about the contemporary church in any place. It is a worldly organization, it is people talking to each other, it is in some measure political, it can be used for good or evil and it can turn from one to the other quickly, it is no better than human beings are.

Everyone has something they want me to believe. But I'm not shopping around for something to believe. Believing isn't even something one can choose to do voluntarily; it's not like flexing a muscle. 

It was the Jews who set the rules which would have to be fulfilled to name someone the Mashiach. Since then, the church has come up with its own entirely different concept of the Messiah, which is plainly not at all fungible with the idea of the Jewish Mashiach, which I think any intellectually fearless and intellectually honest person (religious or not) can see that Jesus was NOT proven to be. Prophets and Messiahs are a dime a dozen historically. (Street of prophets in the Life of Brian.)

As for proving that Jesus was God, I feel that the case is worse. There is no contemporary evidence whatsoever; all the evidence for this is to come from the Bible. I have no particular problem with the Bible, but I have a large problem with judging its reliability by any means except by evaluating individual claims on their own light. I cannot see that any other approach would be really careful and honest, as we should all be with the truth. No amount of social pressure or supernatural threat will cause me to be any less careful, I look at the evidence. So let's get down to this: there is a canon of texts cobbled together by politicians a few hundred years after the death of Jesus, after Paul (even the synoptic gospels don't start until well after Jesus is dead and the movement has changed radically)... not all Christians have ever agreed on which texts, and certainly they have never agreed on how to interpret them, they differ fundamentally on almost every interpretive question even WITHOUT getting into the interpretations of say Jews or Muslims... all these texts in their languages have been translated by people with various political interests... new fragments are always being found and occasionally they are taken to indicate that whole beloved passages were forged...  I am supposed to take it that every single thing this book says on any topic is absolutely authoritative, without further evidence, and *on that basis alone* I am supposed to take it that this man said he was God. Which isn't even all that plain when I read it myself. It is only said plainly by later authors in the New Testament, and there is absolutely no unequivocal or even very suggestive mention of Jesus being God in any of the Torah. It doesn't work. It's not an argument that Jesus is God, or for any of the rest of these claims which are demonstratedly solely by appealing to the authority of the Bible. Nor, of course, would it make any sense to circularly take the Bible's say-so as proof of the Bible's authority. 

This is without needing to maintain anything about whether the Bible contradicts itself or is immoral, which arguments I leave to others. I treat the Bible by the same standard as all the thousands of scriptures people have regularly devised, from the Vedas and the Avesta down to the writings of Ellen G. White, or Osama Bin Laden, or L. Ron Hubbard. If you want to prove something, you have to prove it. But I am happy to take anything good or true in any book, because good and true are the standards to learn from, and no book or person can be merely *defined* as only producing good or true.

Now, in addition to this I have some deeper objections with the usual doctrines taken to be necessary in Christianity. I find it deeply objectionable and basically idolatrous to say that any human being is God. I can never abide the contemporary Christian idea that there is anything greater in value than what is good. And what is good can never be so simply because some cosmic strong-arm wields incentives or punishments, it is always and forever the same as itself and independent of all people. I can't accept that any voluntary agent with a mind remotely of the same image of a man could be good and also fully in control of all the natural disasters which affect all the innocent beings, it does not make any sense to me.

Even if I were ""on the market,"" shopping for some religious identity to give myself and provide me with my cultural politics, I could still never accept a religion which said that a certain historical man was God, and that man created everything, and that everyone has to believe x, y and z about him or be tortured eternally (as if that were a reasonable punishment for not self-deceiving, or as if it were a proportional punishment for anything at all save torturing others eternally). So I am not up for grabs as a potential convert to fly a flag for your community, whatever it is. Though I've changed my mind and realized things many times, I have never had any sort of conversion experience, don't put stock in them and don't plan one.

But if you have something true to say or if you are participating in the good then I think you are relating to the rest of us as a brother or a sister in a universal and totally limitless brotherhood, and what is there for me to complain about as far as that?

Actually, Britain just started using the word ""concentration"" for it.  The idea of concentration-camps go back pretty far -- The Romans ran camps for internment of Carthaginians, as well as Gaulic and Germanic tribes that in modern terms would be called Concentration-Camps.  I'm sure the Greeks, Persians, Indians, Chinese, Babylonians and Egyptians were doing similar things as well.  

There are no new things under the sun.  

&gt;The Mongols, famously, were all about the slaughtering and the raping and the heads on spikes.

For somebody who claims to understand nuance, that is very much an un-nuanced way of looking at it.  The world they lived in was much more violent and about the raping and the killing than the modern world.   In 12-14th century every nation and political group around the world -- including the Chinese Empires (there were three big ones at the time)...Well, all the Empires, Nations, City States -- were all about killing and, in modern terms, barbaric.

The Mongols, one can claim, did some things that were very important.   They put China in touch with Persia, India, Egypt, and Europe.  Everybody in the Old World (save sub-Saharan Africa) knew about each other on more than a rumor-level because the Mongol empire was so large (including China, Korea, Persia, Iraq, Northern India, Central Asia, future Russia, and even parts of Poland and Hungry, etc.)  So, everybody knew for the first time in history that the Chinese, and others, had good stuff to trade for.  At other points in the past there were trade contacts, but the Mongols brought it into the open big-time. 

Much of that trade lead to the Europeans starting to read old texts of Roman and Greek writers again.  Texts that they got mostly from the Byzantine Empire, but also from Arab and Catholic Monastic sources.   And that contributed to the Renaissance.  

Then the Mongol Empire Collapsed, trade networks broke down and Europe couldn't get stuff from China or India as easily as before.  And then the Ottomans stepped in and really clamped down and turned off European trade with those beyond the Ottoman lands.   So, the Europeans had to look for another route to East Asia and India.  And that lead to the Portuguese and Spanish sailing south and east.   

And that way lead the Modern World.  ",,False,1,,True,davidreiss666,True,1265163616,0,1,t5_6,t1_c0jvbmq,c0jvy95,0,reddit.com

Sounds like they taught you the history they wanted you to believe, and I do find teaching anti-biblical doctines under the guise of Christianity to be sinister.

Here's a few quotes for you.
---------------------------

&gt; ""My history of the Jesuits is not eloquently written, but it is supported by unquestionable authorities, [and] is very particular and very horrible. Their [the Jesuit Order’s] restoration [in 1814 by Pope Pius VII] is indeed a step toward darkness, cruelty, despotism, [and] death. … I do not like the appearance of the Jesuits. If ever there was a body of men who merited eternal damnation on earth and in hell, it is this Society of [Ignatius de] Loyola.""


- John Adams (1735-1826; 2nd President of the United States)
---------------------------

&gt; ""It is my opinion that if the liberties of this country – the United States of America – are destroyed, it will be by the subtlety of the Roman Catholic Jesuit priests, for they are the most crafty, dangerous enemies to civil and religious liberty. They have instigated MOST of the wars of Europe.""


- Marquis de LaFayette (1757-1834; French statesman and general. He served in the American Continental Army under the command of General George Washington during the American Revolutionary War.)
---------------------------

&gt; ""The war [i.e., the American Civil War of 1861-1865] would never have been possible without the sinister influence of the Jesuits.""


- Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865; 16th President of the United States)
---------------------------

&gt; ""The Jesuits are a MILITARY organization, not a religious order. Their chief is a general of an army, not the mere father abbot of a monastery. And the aim of this organization is power – power in its most despotic exercise – absolute power, universal power, power to control the world by the volition of a single man [i.e., the Black Pope, the Superior General of the Jesuits]. Jesuitism is the most absolute of despotisms [sic] – and at the same time the greatest and most enormous of abuses…""


- Napoleon I (i.e., Napoleon Bonaparte; 1769-1821; emperor of the French)
---------------------------

&gt; ""Between 1555 and 1931 the Society of Jesus [i.e., the Jesuit Order] was expelled from at least 83 countries, city states and cities, for engaging in political intrigue and subversion plots against the welfare of the State, according to the records of a Jesuit priest of repute [Thomas J. Campbell]. …Practically every instance of expulsion was for political intrigue, political infiltration, political subversion, and inciting to political insurrection."" (1987)


- J.E.C. Shepherd (Canadian historian)
---------------------------


The Nazi regime was controlled by the Jesuits. Hitler came from a Roman Catholic family and praised the Jesuits in Mein Kampf. Hitler was brought to power by Franz von Papen, a Knight of Malta. Himmler (Head of Hitler's SS) was a Knight of Malta. Goebbels (Head of Hitler's Propaganda Ministry) was trained at a Jesuit college. Gehlen (Hitler's Intelligence Chief) was a Knight of Malta. Hitler's allies were almost exclusively Roman Catholic. They included Franco, who had many Opus Dei members in his government and who kissed the Pope's hand, and Mussolini, a Knight of Malta who was advised by a Jesuit priest. Another of his allies, Tiso, was a Roman Catholic Priest. Hitler's financiers (Abs and Thyssen) were Knights of Malta. Hitler said ""Above all I have learned from the Jesuits. And so did Lenin too, as far as I recall. The world has never known anything quite so splendid as the hierarchical structure of the Catholic Church. There were quite a few things I simply appropriated from the Jesuits for the Use of the [Nazi] Party."" he also said ""In [Heinrich] Himmler [who would become head of the Nazi SS] I see our Ignatius de Loyola [Founder of the Jesuits and the first 'Black Pope']"".


Fidel Castro, the Communist Dictator of Cuba, is an undercover Jesuit. He attended three Jesuit schools and went on to graduate from a Jesuit 'preparatory' university (Where his brother, Raul, also attended). From here, he went to law school. After graduating from law school, he joined the Christian Democrat Party, which was actually a Roman Catholic party that was founded under Pope Pius in the 1920s. Cuba is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic now, and Roman Catholics are allowed to join the 'atheist' Communist party. Alberto Rivera, the former Jesuit priest who came public (now dead), said that Castro is a 4th degree, professed Jesuit.


Communism was created by the Jesuits. Karl Marx was trained by Jesuits for nearly 30 years at the British Museum. Vladmir Lenin was trained by Jesuits in Geneva, Switzerland. Joseph Stalin was educated by Jesuit monks at Tiflis Seminary in Georgia. Mao Se Tung was Jesuit-trained and put into power by a Jesuit priest.

The Jesuits control the US Military. The head of the Defense Department, Robert Gates, was Jesuit-trained at Georgetown University, as was his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld. Peter Pace, the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was Jesuit-trained at Georgetown University. The current Chair and Vice Chair of the Joint Chiefs are both Roman Catholic. David Petraeus and George W. Casey, Jr., the generals who commanded US forces in Iraq, were both Jesuit-trained at Georgetown University.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is a Jesuit operation. The first director was Tom Ridge, a devoutly Roman Catholic Knight of Columbus. The real power behind the DHS was John C. Gannon, the head of it's intelligence unit. Gannon was Jesuit-trained at the College of the Holy Cross and is a member of the Jesuit Volunteer Corps. The deputy director of the DHS from 2005-2007 was Michael P. Jackson, who was Jesuit-trained at Georgetown University. Bush's first pick for the second DHS director was a Roman Catholic man. In the end, he chose Michael Chertoff, who is married to a Jesuit professor (Meryl Chertoff). Under Chertoff, the head of the DHS' immigration was Emilio T. Gonzalez, a Knight of Malta. The new DHS director (Under Obama) is Janet Napolitano, who was Jesuit-trained at Santa Clara University.


 The PATRIOT Act was written by Viet Dinh, a Roman Catholic professor at Georgetown University, the Jesuit University of Washington DC.


The current head of the CIA was Jesuit-trained at Santa Clara University. The current head of the DOD was Jesuit-trained at Georgetown University. The current head of the DHS was Jesuit-trained at Santa Clara University. The current head of the ATF was Jesuit-trained at Boston College High School.


Blackwater (Changing it's name to 'Xe') was founded by Erik Prince, a devout Roman Catholic. It's Chief of Operations (until recently), Joseph E. Schmitz, who previously worked for the Pentagon as the former Inspector General of the Department of Defense is a Knight of Malta an Opus Dei and Jesuit trained at Georgetown Preparatory School and Georgetown University and was also a Professor there. Author Jeremy Scahill linked the Knights of Malta directly to Blackwater. Blackwaters founder, Erik Prince is also a Knight of Malta and has recently been implicated in the murder of individuals who were cooperating with federal authorities investigating the company. A former employee also alleges that Prince ""views himself as a Christian crusader tasked with eliminating Muslims and the Islamic faith from the globe,"" and that Prince's companies ""encouraged and rewarded the destruction of Iraqi life.""


 At the center of the Iran-Contra scandal were Ronald Reagan, George H.W Bush, William J. Casey, Robert Gates, Oliver North, and Alexander Haig. All of them, with the exception of Robert Gates (who himself was Jesuit-trained) were Knights of Malta. Casey and Haig were Jesuit-trained, as well, and Haig's brother, Francis, was a Jesuit priest.

Basically, I would want to learn every skill, trade, profession, that anyone in town could teach me.  Languages, martial arts, medicine, etc.

You would have absolutely no need to eat.  I'm pretty sure I would try to spend a few years not eating or drinking.

One thing you could do in computer science would be to write a Genetic Algorithm, every day, as quickly as possible.  At night, right before resetting, you could memorize the DNA of the best organism, and seed the following day with it.  I'm not sure what problem you could meaningfully solve, but this would be a way to do it.

If something like Amazon EC2 existed, you could leverage a really amazingly large amount of computation.  Another thing you could do would be to decrypt anything - search through keyspace sequentially, and each night memorize the last key you used, and each morning start from there.  Eventually, you'd break anything breakable - factor any prime, etc.  Also, you could *eventually* guess any password.  Actually, you probably wouldn't need to search sequentially - you could just use a physical random number generator to seed you.

Um - back to the fun stuff...  I would certainly watch every movie at every video store I could get to.  Listen to every song I possibly could.

I might experiment with surviving terrible injuries - cause massive physical harm to myself, and try to learn how I could best survive them on my own.  Granted, I'd only learn ""surviving the first 24 hours,"" but that'd still be impressive.

Another redditor recommended learning lottery numbers for that day, sports teams, etc.  Basically, anything you could possibly bet on.  I'm pretty sure I would do that.  Call a bookie in Europe, where you could bet on anything - bet on everything that happened that day.  Stocks, horse races, etc.

I would try to weasel my way into getting the phone number of someone in Hollywood who I could talk into giving me millions to make a movie.  The same way Phil learned to ""play"" Rita.

Point of disagreement: You are railing against reality.  Education costs money, and HS grads cannot appreciate the value of money.  They will be exploited by loan agencies, whether they are private or governmental.  

I guess my knee-jerk libertarianism didn't like your opposition to privatization.

You define ""a real slave society is? One where anyone who's not independently wealthy is forced to take on tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt just to be allowed to get a job.""  My perspective is that people have to be responsible for their own choices, and choosing to work at a job that requires a college degree, does in fact, require paying for a college degree.

To go further with this, college is mostly a place where smart people are herded to get older and hopefully more mature.  Most jobs do not require skills that can only be developed in college.  In Europe, for example, productive people in similar jobs are far less likely to have a degree than their US counterparts.  So the degree mostly means that the person who earned it was willing to do so, not that they can actually *do* anything the non-degreed person can't do.

Employers hire college grads because of correlation (smart people go to college).  In fact, employers want to hire smart people, but have very few tools to distinguish them.  Moreover, employment law specifically forbids the use of IQ tests as ""discriminatory.""

In fact, the over-availability of student loans has been tremendously inefficient for society in general, encouraging students to take on unsupportable loans.

The ultimate proof of this is that MIT put **all** of their course offerings online, for free.

Actually, reality is that the majority of European states offer flat-out *free* education at their state universities.   And in the grand scheme, it's really not that expensive.  The amount of money we'd need to redirect to pay for the education of qualified adults in our country would only be the tinest percentage of our military budget.

In most countries in the world, ""Student loans"" are loans to make it so that students don't have to work while they're going to school.

So you seem to agree with me here that this situation is wrong...  but I'm unclear on what you're suggesting we do to fix it.  You're right, in a perfect world, a college degree *isn't* required to be an office drone.  But society currently says it is because, as you say, it's a halfway useful way of distinguishing between smart people.

The problem, then, is it means that schools form a gatekeeping role that, once again, *money* is required to pass through.  Either you have to be independently wealthy, or you have to be willing to enslave yourself to the bank for years.  But this doesn't ACTUALLY prove you're smart - it just proves you can come up with money.  

My solution, as you can surmise, is to make state Universities free for citizens.  Not only would that mean that suddenly money is *no significant barrier at all* to the best and smartest being able to carve out their place in society, but it would create an immediate downward pressure on the prices of the private universities that, frankly, have gotten out of control.

As I said in another reply to someone, because of the importance our society places on college degrees, the demand for education is pretty much inelastic.  Only a radical shift in pricing schemes will be able to provide any sort of reliable change in the accessibility of college.

The hard cold truth, whether you like it or not, is that the international community did not recognize Palestinian arabs' claims for the whole of mandate Palestine. If you do not recognize the legitimacy of this decision (and as your own link states, Arabs in general did recognize the UN's right to decide the fate of Palestine), then I don't see how you can demand protections of international law. If you do, in principle, acknowledge international law, then you have to acknowledge some basic facts about it. Europeans had the privilege of allowing jews to settle in Palestine because they won Palestine in war - that is a fact. A legal right for jewish people to settle in Palestine - including West Bank - exists and is derived from the same authority the League of Nations and then UN held over the Palestine question; this is also a fact. It does mean, exactly as I said, that the jews have a right of settlement anywhere in Palestine.

What it does *not* mean, however, is that jews had any rights to harm or displace arabs. Virtually every legal paper out there that deals with the resolution of conflict between zionists and palestinians explicitly demands that rights of the palestinians be preserved. Your own link mentions that in regard to Jerusalem. We are talking here about social and religious rights - but **not** political rights because, again, the international community did not recognize palestinian political rights. And, if jews had no right to harm the arabs, why exactly did Naqba happen?

And here I would ask you a question, you being (I presume) an authentic palestinian arab who would be able to give a honest answer from what his people believe: how do you think this conflict started? You were most certainly educated about this; I want to know what kind of education they gave you. 

&gt; Also, Israel doesn't have a right to exist

Israel has a right to exist. Some would argue that this is because Israel is the ancient national homeland of the jews. Others would argue that it is because Israel has the capacity of turning you into dust. Opinions aside, fact is that Israel already exists and is not going anywhere. On our side, we are desperate for the conflict to end. We have made countless concessions throughout the years which we hoped will bring us closer to the end of this pointless war, but on every step we were deceived and the result was the opposite of what we sought. As long as the meme that Israel ""doesn't have a right to exist"" persists in your society, the reconciliation is impossible. And since you live not that far from me (how far, really? 100km? That is not far at all), can you honestly look at Israel and at your place and say that if the war goes on forever, Israel will break first?

The message from Israel has been consistent and perfectly clear, they have not wavered or changed positions even once. The message is that the Pals can't have what they want, not by asking, not by paying, not by sanctions, and not by force. Operation cast lead demonstrated that Israel will blast right through human shields to reach its intended targets. Hamas cannot hide behind children any longer lest they too become casualties. Israel is in this to win and will do WHATEVER it takes, and has, and will do so far into the future. Oh sure they will offer a couple soldiers up as patsies, but don't think it would be so different next time the IDF responds to rocket fire from Hamas. Maybe the UBERmoronic Pals should reconsider their strategic position and get realistic? Or they can try to fight some more and experience more IDF wrath. You see, they blew it, and whatever they get in the end if anything will be a mere fraction of what they were offered in 2000.

THEY REFUSED and started doing Suicide bombings! So now look at them!!

They had their chance, now they must live as they are until some Islamic republic offers them safe haven as they will find no comfort near Israel. Secondly, Israel is well prepared for any action taken by other nations in support of Palestinians. They are not stupid, they know how Europeans feel, because that is how Israel was created. Israel does not fear the EU, it has good ties with Russia and China, and is in no immediate danger. They can draw this out for decades and they can do so without even flinching, and they will. Pal kids on the other hand have no future whatsoever thanks to Arafat refusing the only good offer they will ever see presented to them.

The reality is that even if they did make a launch in response to an invasion, the counter attack they would receive would completely overwhelm any benefits or destruction caused by their fairly pitiful nuclear weapons (which may well not even reach their target/s).

&gt;His aim could not be invasion because we had nukes ensuring our independence. Which is my entire point that you seem to be transiently advocating for and against.

I'll clarify what I am arguing. My position is that in the case of superpowers, nuclear weapons are only useful to counter other nuclear weapons (and because it is so hard to know every facet of your enemies nuclear arsenal, you only need to have enough to create the illusion you might have more), they have little effect on land wars and thus do not ensure independence.



&gt;Exactly. Which is why no direct conflict broke out, or will break out, between nuclear powers

What? You just completely ignored my point about nuclear weapons not being an effective deterrent against a land war in a MAD situation, go back and answer it please.

1426204428,0,,t3_awqla,t1_c0jyjby,"&gt;I just chose Sickle Cell Anemia because it was the only typically Black disease that came to mind.

This is telling.  If I could give you a piece of advice:  If you're in a home where people pray before meals, bow your head and go along, even if you don't happen to believe in god.  I bet a lot of people call what you are saying ""racist.""  You can most likely avoid this by replacing the word ""race"" with the word ""tribe"" in your speech.  Further, you're making a fundamental mistake when saying traditional concepts of race correspond to actual sub-species of humans.  For example, Colin Powel is ""black,"" but he has no African ancestory to speak of.  By failing to recognize that actually existing notions of race do not correspond to actually existing sub-species, you're coming off as a racist.  

So replace race with the word tribe.  There are three main human tribes, Africans, Europeans and Asians.  There are sub-tribes within each tribe, and some sub-tribes are hybrids.  There are also sub-sub-tribes.  The fact that the actual situation is inconvenient for the lazy diction of lay taxonomy should be expected as this is a scientific issue - people descend from the people they descend from and are in some significant part determined by their ancestors in a typically complex way.  

&gt;The point remains the same, as there are many more inherited weaknesses and illnesses aside from Sickle Cell Anemia.

Advantages are inherited as well, and I would be very surprised if any sufficient body of scientific evidence existed to establish that the disadvantages of cross-tribal adoption outweigh the advantages.  History, for it's part, shows that ancient tribes exchanged members at a limited but appreciable rate.  

&gt;Many of the races are quite distant from each other genetically, particularly Blacks as they were for vast majority of their history stuck in sub-Sahara Africa with little or no contact with other races.  It comes as so surprise that mixing more distant DNA comes with abnormalities, as we see the same thing in other animals; the difference being that humans have not diverged far enough to cause the infertility issue.

&gt; My solution, as you can surmise, is to make state Universities free for citizens.

My solution is the opposite.  End all subsidies for education.  Privatize both University and primary school education for all citizens.  Our society will continue to prosper with half as many Bachelor's degrees.  This is exactly the point of the free MIT education example.  Motivated students can learn for free.  All others are wasting their own time and other people's money.

Ultimately, the problem with free education is that needs are unlimited, but means to fulfill them are limited.  People need food, shelter, clothing, and entertainment too.  Do you propose to provide unlimited amounts of those to all citizens?

**Shift refuses to hand out European bank transaction details to Washington**

The Belgium based business Swift, which processes international payments, refuses to hand over banking details of EU citizens to the USA to assist the war on terrorism, says a Swift spokesman in German newspaper Handelsblatt.

An agreement was made which required the company to provide the details starting February 1st. However, Swift will not adhere to this agreement, says the spokesman: ""As long as the European parliament does not approve of this agreement, it will not go in effect.""

Swift is based in Terhulpen and processes transactions for over 8000 banks all around the world. According to the spokesman, Swift stopped sharing European banking details on January 1st. Swift first wants a legal basis to be in place.

Late November last year, the European ministers of Justice decided to push through Swift its agreement with the USA. It was supposed that the banking details would be shared for 9 months, starting February 1st 2010. European parliament protested fiercely, it was not consulted which would be required by the Treaty of Lissabon. The ministers of Justice pushed the agreement one day before the that treaty went into effect. But according to Swift, the agreement should require approval from the parliament.

The head of the European parliament, Jerzy Buzek, has already said he plans to undo the agreement. The parliament will make its decision on February 10.

The UK hasn't been self sufficient since industrialisation and it is somewhat contentious to suggest that it was before then.  Even in WWII, when the UK was working hard to be utterly self sufficient it still relied on imports and rationing.

The greatest influence on the thinking of Mr. Marx was Capitalism's best freind, Adam Smith. Now if your prof is like like most profs she's likely never read either Smith or Marx but is spouting drivel she heard from her own professors. In studying psychology I found the same ignorance when profs gave their erroneous views on Freud. 

Much of what developed during the industrial revolution was predicted and ridiculed by Smith. The period was a wierd mix of circumstances. Most people don't realize that both Smith and Marx were writing about what they saw in England and in a lesser extent in Europe as a whole. Niether man knew much of the economic affairs of the rest of the world and neither one was prescient as to the structures of today. People don't realize how liimiting that view was when we consider that communication and travel were limited. England at the time was still under a fuedal system of entitlement and obligation which led to the social and economic structure of the day. That fuedal system actually made the exploitation of workers in the cause of economic expansion more effective than in other parts of Europe that had tossed off fuedalism. The *workers revolution* envisaged by Marx was to be an excise of feudal obligation and the rise of capitalism as espoused by Smith, in which the workers have control of thier own production for their own best benefit.

Influences of Roman law
The term ""common law"" is often used as a contrast to Roman-derived ""civil law"" (connotation 2), and the fundamental processes and forms of reasoning in the two are quite different. Nonetheless, there has been considerable cross-fertilization of ideas, while the two traditions and sets of foundational principles remain distinct.
By the time of the rediscovery of the Roman law in Europe in the 12th and 13th centuries, the common law had already developed far enough to prevent a Roman law reception as it occurred on the continent.[30] However, the first common law scholars, most notably Glanvill and Bracton, as well as the early royal common law judges, had been well accustomed with Roman law. Often, they were clerics trained in the Roman canon law.[31] One of the first and throughout its history one of the most significant treatises of the common law, Bracton’s De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae (On the Laws and Customs of England), was heavily influenced by the division of the law in Justinian’s Institutes.[32] The impact Roman law had decreased sharply after the age of Bracton, but the Roman divisions of actions into in rem and in personam used by Bracton had a lasting effect and laid the groundwork for a return of Roman law structural concepts in the 18th and 19th century. Signs of this can be found in Blackstone’s Commentaries on the Laws of England,[33] and Roman law ideas regained importance with the revival of academic law schools in the 19th century.[34] As a result, today, the main systematic divisions of the law into property, contract, and tort (and to some extent unjust enrichment) can be found in the civil law as well as in the common law.[35]",,False,2,,False,camopdude,True,1265315907,0,2,t5_6,t1_c0jzpg9,c0jztpw,0,reddit.com

Apples and oranges comparison - they do not really live in a ""land of plenty"" scenario.  That does not say that these foods are necessarily good for them - just because you're not overweight does not mean your body isn't suffering from the inflammatory and oxidative effects of the phytates, lectins and gluten in grains.

A problem with agriculture is that it allows for more people to survive on less - you have explosions of populations of people that can subsist on nearly nothing because they do not have to work as hard physically for our food.  This leads us to the massive slum populations in places like India and, for example, many places in Africa, where agriculture was introduced, populations explode, famine becomes the norm.

And grains are very new to our diet.  *Homo sapiens sapiens* has been around for 200,000 year, possible more.  Most evidence points to agriculture being around 10,000 years old, making grain, at most, a part of diet for 5% of our history.

An unfortunate byproduct of agriculture is that it disassociated reproductive fitness from physical fitness and dietary adaptations - how healthy someone is and/or able to adapt to the world around them becomes less a factor of whether or not they will reproduce, completely derailing evolution as we have known it.

So what has happened is that we've added a new food source and have not really had selective pressure to adapt to it.  So we don't, really.  This is why 1/3 of the population has more-than-baseline reaction to gluten, though really everyone has some measure of sensitivity to it.

HFCS in US is still more expensive than sucrose on free international market. Without government intervention in form of both tariffs and subsidies, it would be even cheaper to add sugar to foods than it is now.

US government policies on sugar and corn are just special interest groups taking taxpayers money, they don't result in lower prices.

No, they use sugar. EU annual production of sucrose is 18.6mln ton vs 0.3mln ton of isoglucose (as HFCS is called there), and there's not much in terms of import due to excessive tariffs. Isoglucose/HFCS is only about 1.5% of EU sugar consumption.

You don't need to enslave people with guns - simply isolate them from the ability to legally feed themselves, and wait for them to sell their children.

As for peaceful beliefs, they didn't have to fight often, before the 20th century. They were, if I understand this correctly, MUCH admired by the mongols - a driving military force in the area. They had all the protection they needed. They 'outsourced' their protection, and cultivated none of their own.

When the early 1900s came about and every european power with a single ship was putting flags on a piece of land that didn't disappear underwater for more than 300 days a year - tibet was done for. ultimately a few world wars gave tibet some breathing room - until china had stabilized just enough to realize - there was no way they were going to let a non-communist power establish a toehold on that side of the himalayas.

Ultimately as regrettable as Minoa, or Phonicia, or any of the thousands of others of lost cultures... bad timing, bad placement, no effective force capable of resisting foreign incursion.

Before the drinking, and as gently and diplomatically as I can possibly put this; just because lots of people feel the way you do, doesn't make it true. It doesn't make it false either - not claiming that for a second. But often, because views are popular, people don't feel the need to defend them.

EU banking data deal with U.S. becomes a damp squib

Stage victory for Europe's Data Protection:  The Swift agreements regarding bank data sharing with the U.S. will not be implemented right away as planned. The Belgian financial services provider Swift, which provides the data, denied until further cooperation with European and American authorities.  Now comes a bilateral arrangement?

BRUSSELS.  The controversial new EU agreement on the transfer of European banking data to U.S. terror investigators has run into a hurdle. Without a clear and reliable legal basis, no bank records would be delivered, said a Swift spokesman in Brussels.  So far, there has been neither a request nor a transfer of such data (by the U.S.). 

The blockade is supported by the BvdB (Federal Association of German Banks). ""Until now, customer privacy was not adequately secured,"" said association spokesman Thomas Schlüter. The banking industry has put a lot into ensuring that access to such data will be withheld from the U.S. authorities.  According to Schluter, the association is not in a hurry to implement the agreement.  Swift must decide how to proceed. 

Data transfer was to have begun on Monday 

Swift is an international association representing approximately 9000 banks, central banks and other financial companies.  Their computer servers carry more than 15 million transactions worth an estimated six billion dollars daily.  In the Swift agreements, the EU promises the U.S. to provide bank account details on request, to hunt down suspected terrorists.  (According to the agreement,) the data transfer was to have begun on Monday. 

But nothing came of it: ""We will not apply the new agreement,"" said a Swift spokesman yesterday. So far, the agreement lacked the approval of the European Parliament, which, according to the Lisbon Treaty, has a voice in internal affairs. ""As long as the EU Parliament has not approved the agreement, it is not in force,"" said the spokesman. Therefore, no data could be transmitted. MEPs (Members of European Parliament) will take up the matter on 10 February, a refusal is likely. 

Access to European bank transfer information has been suspended since 1 January, Swift said. Since the beginning of this year, data has been processed on servers located in the Netherlands and Switzerland - not (on servers in) Washington DC (which was up until recently the practice). Therefore, U.S. terror investigators, who gained access to such coveted data after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 without any clear legal basis, must now do without such data.  Even European services analyze the findings. 

The EU Commission and the Council of Ministers in Brussels have expressed their support for Swift Agreement and have warned about a ""lapse of security"". German Interior Minister Thomas de Maizière (CDU) argued that such groups as the ""Sauerland Group"" (purported German islamic terrorist cell) had been identified using banking information. The German Federal Criminal Police, however, expressed doubt and criticized the ""considerable material and human effort"" required (to evaluate such data). 

Massive invasion of privacy 

The interruption is a victory for data protection.  European Data Protection Supervisor Peter Hustinx has repeatedly warned about the tapping of data from Swift.  (He expressed the opinion that) the agreement is a massive grab into the private sphere. ""It's about the private lives of all Europeans, who do bank transfers within Europe."" The processing of commercial data for law enforcement purposes violates a fundamental principle of the protection of information, (it must be purpose-bound).  Furthermore, the benefit is not proven. 

The Council of Ministers, which had negotiated and finalized the agreement, reacted calmly to the suspension of data transfer. This was a decision of the Swift company, a spokesman said. It was expected that the situation would be clarified with the vote of Parliament in the coming week. However, there was no ""plan B"" if the agreement fails, an EU diplomat conceded. Perhaps the United States would then seek a bilateral solution with those countries in which the Swift servers with European data are located. That would weaken data privacy even more, the diplomat said. 

Swift is also concerned about this. The U.S. could try to get at the data via bilateral agreements, the company says.  The Americans have already done it this way; especially Belgium, where Swift is headquartered, has come under pressure. Such an approach would, however, raise new questions, Brussels said. Any bilateral agreements must be legally sound and assure data privacy. 

""We shall turn our attention to the relevant political, legal and data protection authorities to resolve the problem,"" announced the Swift spokesman.  Thus begins (what could turn into) a months-long tug of war, with an unclear finish.  Certain is only that the EU needs to renegotiate the agreement again.  The current, controversial text is only valid for the next nine months.  This spring, the EU Commission intends to submit a new draft, which should then lead to a definitive agreement. 

The European Parliament is anything but unhappy about the anticipated delays. ""We have to be patient - we can do without these Swift agreements, until our demands are met,"" said the FDP (German Free Liberal) representative Alexander Alvaro. ""I welcome Swift's announcement that it will no longer convey European bank data to the U.S. government,"" rejoiced the Green politician Jan Philipp Albrecht. The Parliament will no longer be ignored. 

Parliament had repeatedly complained that they were not involved in the Swift negotiations. Besides Liberals, Greens and Social Democrats, Christian Democrats had also spoken out against the agreement. It would create a ""glass (transparent) citizen"", said the CSU MEP Markus Ferber. However, it is unclear whether Ferber's colleagues from Southern and Eastern Europe see it that way as well.

Dubai also happens, as a part of the UAE to be a signatory to the treaty of Rome, unlike the US for example, and so a party that sees the ICC and the warrants it issues as valid, along with a hundred or so other nations (including most of Europe).

I think the main point is that whilst Saudi is a US ally and has in the past played a role in trying to get Dubai to move from it's pro-Iranian position, it is probably that Dubai has gained more from its pro-Iranian stance than it has lost.  Moreover Dubai would have 'fallen' to the same degree regardless, it is true that Saudi could have 'helped' more if Dubai had been willing to collaborate with it and the US, but again, that is arguable.  Lastly, Dubai largely seems to be helping Iran get around US imposed sanctions, not UN sanctions, and it is acting as an intermediary for Western and European companies (and seeing a benefit...), US sanctions (like those against Cuba) are generally ignored by most of the world, partly because there is a lack of agreement as to their necessity (otherwise they would be part of the UN sanction set) and partly because it would go against their own interests..

You are absolutely correct, if you want a house in Toronto, you'll have to pay extra for it for the reasons you mentioned. 

Are houses cheap in Toronto? The affordable average 10-20 year old house with 2 floors and 2 garages and about 3000 sq ft. are probably about $350-650,000 depending on the address (pulling numbers out of my head). That is about 4 million Yuan (RMB), for a house that is in one of the largest cities in Canada.

Comparing to China, a house in one of the largest cities, you name it, Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, or wherever, the price of a house that is about 3000 sq ft / 300 sq m, would cost about from 10 million Yuan which is about $1.5 Million CDN and goes upwards, with the quality / workmanship untested against time, and generally quite far from the city core.

So Chinese view these houses in Vancouver or Toronto as absolute bargain. 

Even with the land tax and yard maintenance along with H2O + gas + electricity, buying a house still beats buying a condo unit because of a condo's maintenance fee alone which escalates every year as the building requires more and more money to maintain (elevators go up and down quite a bit), while condo units still gets hit with property tax just the same as a house.

Even if the green belt (Toronto) gets permission for housing, being so far away from city core will only attract those who can't afford to be in and around the cores, and those who can stand the commute. 

Although you are right that many local folks are being forced into debt, or unnecessarily higher debt due to higher housing prices, however, the wealth effect is still there to offset it. It's a bitch however, to newly weds, students entering the job market, or those who haven't bought a house yet prior to the current boom.

So with the reasons you have listed above, what could be the ""equalizer"" that will dampen the market? My guesses are the following.

1) Ownership / Residency rule change. (Not likely but hey...who can guess what politicians think?)

2) Interest rates increase. (Somewhat likely but if it's not big changes, the effects will be muted)

3) Job market deterioration. (Somewhat likely)

4) Crash of Chinese economies (which means the US crashed too as China earns much from export to US, which means Europe crashed too as Europe also relies on US for export revenue) (somewhat likely and this will drain the flood of buyers and money available for properties in Vancouver and Toronto in particular) 

5) Changes in immigration laws / number of immigrants accepted (not likely, as Canada need the youth replacement for the aging population and foreign money coming into the country)

6) Crime rates swell around housing belts. (somewhat likely if economy keeps being clogged and job market goes down) 

7) Natural disasters / epidemics such as a repeat of SARS or similar. (likely but effects are temporary, or at least I hope)

Also, if you are dead set on naming the culprits, then do talk to the guys who were hiring these banks in first place. Everyone in 2007 thought this thing can never turn - it takes 2 parties to borrow money (and yes, I am also blaming people who took out mortgages at $1mm on a salary of $50k). It's always sad that there are a lot of people that are caught in the middle of it, but the bubble was going to burst at some point. The question I have is that how have we made sure that it does not happen again? Where are all the banking laws/regulations that everyone was dead set to put in place after 2007? Why are we focused on bonuses instead of fixing the system? Bonuses are only the symptom, not the driver. I am pretty confident that we'll see another bust in a couple of years otherwise.

one goes through enough experience in life while growing up, though, to know that it's not ok to make fun of people in cruel ways.  making fun of fat people gets old, it's the most uncreative way to make jokes and possibly the easiest target one could choose to make a joke about.

this joke is funny though, despite your sensitivities.  i think the real comical value in the joke is not so much that she's fat but that she's clearly such and oddball in the group and totally managed to fuck up the picture because she couldn't jump with the rest of them. i feel really bad that people are so disrespectful to you.  but many humorous things posted here can be offensive.  i've been offended a few times by jokes on reddit, as well.

some people have no regard for the emotions of others... jokes labeled [pic] are usually done at someone else's expense.  i think the reason why people find it acceptable and easy to make fun of certain subject matters (such as being fat) has to do with the perception that those people ""can help it but they choose not to"".  it's in the same spirit of how we make fun of jersey shore type people, ignorant tea party protesters, etc.

i'm not saying it's right, this is just the way that people are able to reason it.  the root cause of obesity can be different from people to people (genetic and psychological components apply), but the mechanism for storing fat in the human body is very simple: calories in, calories out.  this is scientific and undisputed... you can only get fat if you eat more than your body is able to cope with. different people have different metabolisms, but with a reasonable diet (ie one that's low in refined sugars, low in processed and fatty foods, and a bit higher in greens and fruits), 99% of the cases of obesity would likely disappear (compare white americans with european ancestry to europeans with similar genetic compositions but way different diets, and it's easy to understand that diet is a huge part of the problem).

it's unfortunate that your friends and others pick on you.  that is inexcusable behavior and those people should learn how to treat others with respect.  but there is only one realistic way to make the teasing go away permanently, and that would be to lose some weight.

i don't mean to be hard on you, but it is a lot easier to change yourself than to change society.  not to mention all of the health benefits you would get by losing weight.

whatever the case, you have choices in life, dude.  being fat is not a disability... but if you believe it is, then ultimately you will always pity yourself and turn it into one.  be fat and be happy... or if you can't be happy by the way you're treated when fat, lose weight and see what results you get.  and them dump all your friends for being such assholes

&gt;If you look at the actual numbers you will quickly realize that more people are trying to get to the USA, and more people are denied entry to the USA than the number of Israelis that are denied entry to a particular muslim country...

That's because no Israeli even tries to enter a Muslim country (other than Jordan and Egypt), because it's impossible with an Israeli passport or an Israeli stamp in your passport. 

Muslim states will bar Israelis and passports with Israeli visas 100% of the time (if they see it), whereas country-of-origin is only a factor in determining visa or entry eligibility in other countries. 

&gt;You can have your Israeli citizenship revoked for telling the truth about Israel.

Many nations have a clause about revoking citizenship for treason. This has never been invoked for ""telling the truth"" or any such nonsense and is reserved for things like  selling off secrets to enemy states.

You don't just change document over.  You change tools/equipment, software, manufacturing orders, industrial plants, vehicles, dials/readouts, hard-coded circuit boards, etc.  Above all, you change *people* who have been used to operating in a certain system.  That's very expensive.

&gt; Emotional attachment to the imperial system on the other hand, can safely be ignored in favor of the metric system's above benefits.

The metric system has little benefit over the imperial system.  The factor of 10 thing could easily be replicated in the imperial system; just measure everything in microinches, kilogallons, etc.  The Mars mission didn't fail because of a problem converting feet to miles.  It failed because of a problem converting pounds to Newtons.  The advantage of the metric system is that the whole rest of the world uses it.

We could define everything based off of Planck units (but make the 10^0 unit something macroscopic).  But no one would use pseduo-Plackian units even if they were superior because of the change-over cost.

&gt;In any case, you'd have to prove one language to be superior to all the others in efficiency, ease-of-mastery, and lack of intellectual barriers inherent to it, before you could choose one that you wanted all people to learn.

You don't need to demonstrate that one system is better than the other.  You just demonstrate that the status quo (two systems) is worse than the target (one system, which ever it may be).

&gt;There are hundreds of languages currently in use on this planet, and you can't just convince people to change over, as most of them have an emotional attachment to their first language.

It's not just emotional attachment.  It's very *expensive* to train people to speak multiple languages.  People in Europe are more likely to invest in learning multiple languages than people in the US because the former interact with several languages on a routine basis.  In the US, you can drive 1000 miles in every direction without needing anything but English.  It has nothing to do with Americans being more emotionally attached to English.

Then how do you explain the Crusades? The Spanish Inquisition? Conversion or death for the natives of the Americas when the Spaniards and Portuguese arrived in the New World? Biblical defense of Western slavery?

At what point, exactly, did our civilization stop ""forming""? Where exactly are you drawing the line between uncivilized and civilized? Because *everywhere you would draw that line, I can and will find a religious atrocity that came afterward*.

Furthermore, you appear to have completely ignored the part where I said these atrocities were depicted *favorably*. You do not seem to appreciate the implications of that. Let us take the war crimes of Moses, for example, where he sent in his armies to slaughter whole cities, save for the young women who were gang raped and/or enslaved. Traditional Christian doctrine holds that these atrocities are acceptable *because God ordered Moses to do those things*. God cannot order an immoral act.

It's also very insulting to the Jews to basically characterize their Torah as a work in progress. But you are clearly very comfortable with such a bold implication.

&gt;Religion or should I say ethics, helped in lessening that.

Bullshit. I just told you what Biblical ""ethics"" are. Biblical ethics are little more than doing what this god tells you to do, or else.

Let me tell you about ethics and morality. It's about doing the right thing even when no one is going to notice or care. It's about doing the right thing even when the wrong thing would have a much greater reward. It's about knowing *why* the wrong thing is wrong and the right thing is right. The Bible does not really teach these things. The Bible tells me to follow orders. The Bible tells me to be obedient. There is no illumination or lessen there. I've gotten better advice from a fortune cookie.

&gt;Imagine if people continued fighting and went down the Darwinian path. We'd have multiple Hitlers and our species would have likely went extinct.

We *have* had multiple Hitlers. They wore the robes of the Catholic Church when they sent armies of soldiers and civilians to sweep through Europe even before they reached Jerusalem fight the Saracens over control of the city during the Crusades. Tens of thousands of Jews were killed by French zealots roaming the countryside as they headed south and east.

To say nothing of what the Crusaders did to the city in 1066.

They wore the robes of the Catholic Church when they accepted hundreds of slaves from Hispaniola, who were sent across the Atlantic back to Europe in the belly of a ship where hundreds more of them died of starvation and disease before they arrived.

There were an estimated 100 million people living in the Americas when Columbus landed. 300,000 on Hispaniola alone. That island was wiped clean within a few years. Its people were killed, tortured, mutilated, and infected with disease.

They stood in the Oval Office of the White House when they declared the doctrine of Manifest Destiny: that God wanted the United States to stretch From Sea to Shining Sea, never mind that the land was already occupied by millions of people. They ordered their armies to slaughter defenseless civilians when they refused to leave their ancestral homes. And they wore the cloak of supernatural edict to protect themselves from the spray of blood and guts.

And speaking of Hitler in particular, let me offer you [a choice quote](http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/quotes_hitler.html):

&gt;“My feeling as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded only by a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was his fight against the Jewish poison. Today, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to shed his blood upon the Cross. As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice. And as a man I have the duty to see to it that human society does not suffer the same catastrophic collapse as did the civilization of the ancient world some two thousand years ago — a civilization which was driven to its ruin through this same Jewish people.

&gt;“Then indeed when Rome collapsed there were endless streams of new German bands flowing into the Empire from the North; but, if Germany collapses today, who is there to come after us? German blood upon this earth is on the way to gradual exhaustion unless we pull ourselves together and make ourselves free!

&gt;“And if there is anything which could demonstrate that we are acting rightly, it is the distress that daily grows. For as a Christian I have also a duty to my own people. And when I look on my people I see them work and work and toil and labor, and at the end of the week they have only for their wages wretchedness and misery. When I go out in the morning and see these men standing in their queues and look into their pinched faces, then I believe I would be no Christian, but a very devil, if I felt no pity for them, if I did not, as did our Lord two thousand years ago, turn against those by whom today this poor people are plundered and exploited.”

Was he actually a Christian? *It doesn't matter*. He was able to use Christian doctrine to lead Germany into war.

[Gar Alperovitz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gar_Alperovitz):
&gt;Although Japanese peace feelers had been sent out as early as September 1944 (and [China's] Chiang Kai-shek had been approached regarding surrender possibilities in December 1944), the real effort to end the war began in the spring of 1945. 

Okay, the scholasticism of this Alperovitz character has been called into question on precisely this issue.  I'm not sure why he would lie, but it's worth bearing in mind that he's at least been accused of it.

Next up is [Walter Trohan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Trohan) who, according to the article, ""revealed that on January 20, 1945, two days prior to his departure for the Yalta meeting with Stalin and Churchill, President Roosevelt received a 40-page memorandum from General Douglas MacArthur outlining five separate surrender overtures from high-level Japanese officials.""  The Chicago Tribune seems to acknowledge an [article with a headline](http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/475703002.html?dids=475703002:475703002&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Aug+19,+1945&amp;author=WALTER+TROHAN&amp;pub=Chicago+Daily+Tribune+\(1872-1963\)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=1&amp;desc=BARE+PEACE+BID+U.+S.+REBUFFED+7+MONTHS+AGO) that amounts to as much.  How do you respond to this dossier?  The Japanese weren't enthusiastic enough in their entreaty for peace?  They needed to be nuked into submission?

Next cited is [Harry Barnes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Elmer_Barnes), also a holocaust denier with neo-nazi sympathies.  (What's up with all these holocaust deniers?  For the record, I am not a holcaust denier.)  Barnes claims that: ""The authenticity of the Trohan article was never challenged by the White House or the State Department...""  Can we accept the Trohan article as true or not?  Apparently its legitimacy is cast in doubt?  By whom?  Why would Trohan lie?

Edwin P. Hoyt:
&gt; The atomic bomb is indeed a fearsome weapon, but it was not the cause of Japan's surrender, even though the myth persists even to this day.

Dennis D. Waynstock: 

&gt;By April 1945, Japan's leaders realized that the war was lost. Their main stumbling block to surrender was the United States' insistence on unconditional surrender. They specifically needed to know whether the United States would allow Hirohito to remain on the throne. They feared that the United States would depose him, try him as a war criminal, or even execute him ...

&gt;Unconditional surrender was a policy of revenge, and it hurt America's national self-interest. It prolonged the war in both Europe and East Asia, and it helped to expand Soviet power in those areas.

Are *all* of these accounts biased?  *All* of them baseless?

Now, why don't you provide an inscrutable source demonstrating that the Japanese were hell bent on forcing the Americans into a land invasion?  That they offered absolutely no hope for a peaceful resolution?  And even if they were unwilling to submit to an unconditional surrender--so what?  We had incapacitated their military machine.  They were no longer an imminent threat.  Why the urgency?  Why not let them stew over their options and let them come to their senses without the application of violence on our part?  Come now, let's see you provide an inscrutable source for all this.

The way I see things, the US government and military had an incentive to use Japan in order to make a point to the world.  This is something that is often done in history--and still done today.

The last *real* economic upturn we had was after WWII, and it was fueled by political changes (don't pretend it had anything to do with ""wartime full employment""); when your country emerges as a superpower and the entire world decides that your currency is the medium of choice for trade, it causes a bit of a windfall to the producers in that country. The US was nouveau-riche. So what did we do? We spent. We spent on programs to increase the quality of life; we spent on nifty gadgets to amuse ourselves; occasionally we even did something sensible and spent on infrastructure that might actually pay back in the long run. We spent more than we could produce for ourselves, but that was cool -- everyone knew that the dollar was as good as gold, and the US wasn't in danger of disappearing before we could make good on our promises, so the credit was forthcoming.

What couldn't be foreseen was that this would continue indefinitely. Everyone knows that if you get into debt, unless it was to buy something that makes you money, then you need to have a lean period later on while you repay the debt. Buying on credit is a way of taking from your future self -- you get to have something today, but you have to give something up tomorrow, and the next day, until the loan is repaid, to make your payments. Postwar Americans never really could get behind this concept; they thought it was a real bummer. So we just kept on spending our *future* production because hey, Social Security is nice, and electronics are nifty, and having a house out in the country is awesome! And who cares that the portion of the economy that goes to just paying interest is on the rise? More credit is always forthcoming!

And there's a fiction among the ""civilized"" nations of the west that this is the way it should be, and will continue indefinitely, when it was really a fluke. Now we live in a world with the EU and Japan and India and China and a progressive (more or less) Middle East and a modernizing Africa and even the *existence* of superpowers is in question; the US makes less and less of anything the world wants, and buys more and more...

Basically, in the long run, we're deep in a hole, digging deeper, and the only ways out are another major political upheaval (with results impossible to predict), or massive devaluation of the dollar.

Militarily they had no equals during their expansionary period. Their professional army would not be matched in Europe in efficiency, speed, strength, and size until the modern era.

Though there was negative feeling toward them, as you say, because of usury laws, this did not translate into violence until around the 11th century. 

Second, I've never heard of Germans blaming Jews for corruption in the catholic church, though there was much blame put on Jews for the bubonic plague, which surfaced periodically beginning in the 1340s around the time you seem to be talking about in point 3.

Third, Jews were either expelled from or massacred in many German cities beginning about this time in the 14th and 15th centuries and continuing until the beginning of the Reformation. Thus, by the 16th century, most Jews who still remained in Germany lived in the countryside. This leads me to my next point:

Fourth, antisemitism after the Napoleonic Wars was largely a result of Jews moving back into cities now that they were allowed to do so. As you said, you had to condense a lot of history into a small space, but I think it is a big mistake to say hatred of Jews was a simple displacement of Catholic/Protestant tensions. 

Fifth, when you say ""the German people blamed the Jews for undermining the war effort"" you are using quite a broad brush. Again, I understand more as I write this your point about condensing history, but a large part of the German population blamed their performance in the war on other factors. 

Sixth, your point number seven contains the most controversial material of your statement. Historians dispute to what extent antisemitism was a factor in Hitler's election to chancellor. I tend to believe that people accepted it as a traditional part of right wing politics in Germany, and didn't give it much thought, voting for Hitler for other reasons. Also, one must keep in mind that despite his broad support, many of the people thrown into concentration camps were non-Jewish opponents of the Nazis, like Socialists and Communists. 

Finally, it was not only revenge that motivated the Nazi Party's actions against the Jews of Europe. They sincerely thought that the Jewish ""race"" (not religion, and here is where things are different in 1941 as opposed to 1348) was corrupting the German ""race."" It was an insane, biologically racist idea that led to the Holocaust, and although this may have had roots in the long history of anti-Jewishness in Germany, it was distinctly different.

Only in the Anglo-western sphere is Global warming a left vs right issue. For the rest of the world it is rich vs poor. Developed Nations vs. Emerging Economies. IP/Technology rights holders vs Product Producers that they run deficits with.

The capacity for developed economies with their ~3% economic growth rates to increase carbon output is far less than a country that does not have a fully formed industrial base, which is growing at 9-12%.

Meanwhile these economies are running trade deficits to the developing and emerging economies, because they buy more cheap products that those economies buy services and technology from the Western Nations. What is the power elite in the developed nations to do?

Climate treaties do two things, 1) they stifle the development of the emerging economies more than western economies, maintaining the Wests dominance, 2) require emerging/developing nations to buy IP and technology from the west, offsetting the trade imbalance that the west has with the emerging economies.

1426206547,0,,t3_aypek,t1_c0k32sm,"Edit: This is my personal experience of living in the UK, which is in some ways not a very typical European country.

I am not required to have, nor carry, nor show to any agent of the state at any time any form of ID. 

I am not required to fill in a tax return.

It is very unlikely that any police officer I speak to will be armed. I have spoken with a police officer involuntarily exactly twice in my 38 years. One of those times was because a neighbour had seen my motorcycle used on what you would call the sidewalk (long story, but this was actually true). I was given a ticket (but no fine) and warning that if a second such complaint was received the bike would be impounded.

I once crashed a motorcycle and shattered an elbow in the process. A government run ambulance came and picked me up, no questions asked, and took me to a government run hospital. I lived there for a week while my elbow was rebuilt using titanium. No pre-autorisation required, no charge afterwards.

Bars can more-or-less set their own opening hours but need a good reason to open early in the morning. Some of them find that that reason. No-one need show ID to enter a bar. Alcoholic beverages of any kind can be openly sold by any kind of shop. Some urban areas that have had a problem with public drunkenness have banned drinking alcohol outdoors.

Any kind of shop can sell fireworks.

Prostitution is legal (but almost everything _to do_ with prostitution isn't).

People recognised by the government health service as opiate addicts can be prescribed methadone replacement therapy (I think—but am not certain—at no cost to themselves). It is not illegal to be an addict. The equivalent of Tylenol No. 1 is available without prescription.

Handguns are illegal (so only criminals have them, it's true, but handgun crime is still rare). Shotguns are legal but you need a good reason to obtain a shotgun licence. Non-repeating rifles are legal but you need an extremely good reason to obtain a firearm licence. There's a guy working in my office who has one. I grew up in the country and pretty much every farmhouse had at least a shotgun in it. It is illegal to carry a knife with a fixed or locking blade longer than 3 inches.

All those travelling in a car must use seat belts, all those travelling by motorcycle must wear a helmet meeting one of a couple of different government standards. It's pretty much impossible to buy a helmet that does not far exceed those standards. Every vehicle on the road must be taxed, that tax is used to maintain the roads. Every vehicle used on the public roads and more than three years old must pass a very basic test of mechanical integrity at a government testing station once a year. Cars sold here are, at the insistence of the government, amongst the most difficult to steal in the world. The government runs a laboratory to assess and rate vehicle security systems.

Everyone who watches live broadcast TV must buy a licence to do so, and the fees from that fund free-to-air public service broadcasting. This paid for every David Attenborough documentary, most of that stuff on Masterpiece Theatre, Doctor Who, Monty Python, the original of The Offfice, Ali G, Top Gear, the original of the thing that you know as ""All In the Family"", the original of the thing that you know as ""Cosby"".

If I lose my job through no fault of my own then I'm are entitled to claim a (very basic) allowance. If I lose my home I'm are entitled to (very basic) housing. If I cannot work through chronic ill-health then in addition to free health care I will also receive a (fractionally less basic) allowance. Employers may not discriminate on race, age, disability nor religion. 

Forgot something: everyone is entitled to one (exactly one), very heavily subsidised attempt to get into a university. If you can get Oxford or Cambridge (for example) to accept you as a student then a big chunk of your costs will be met out of taxation and a chunk more from extremely cheap loans. There is only one private, for profit university in the country.

In my area, negative attitudes towards whites are more passive. Only with whites directly involved in tribal affairs do cries ring out. Often, spouses of tribal members apply for high-profile positions in the government or are recognized for their immense contributions, and the older generations will protest. My father held a job with the tribe and had to deal with complaint on a regular basis directly without subtlety at his Caucasian background. The same attitudes amplify with some tribes, to the point that whites are outwardly hated (American Northwest), usually by the older generations. In kind, some tribes experience this to little or no degree at all.

I realized there was no point in trying to classify music with such granularity.

Tunisian are very friendly to each other  (in our way), family and neighborhood are vey important in our tradition and religion, so we know all our neighbors and of course our big families that we meet in the two islam's festival. To foreign we are also friendly, Tunisia is a touristic country, so we got used of seeing them. Same goes for America, although we hate your gouvernment and your politic of invading Afghanistan and Iraq and helping Israel.   
Somtimes, after a unpopular move by the US, the public will start hating the US in itself (not the individuals), and you would see in times of high unpopularity a happiness when something bad happens there (as the economic crisis where people rejoiced, and even some started paying the bill of all the people sitting in the caffé after hearing in the news that some banks got broke). So yes most of the time the US is highly inpopular in Tunisia, but it's the same in all Arabic countries, Tunisia is minimal in comparision to middle east where people hate the US from their hearts (and they have some damn good reasons).

""How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism[72 virgins, I'm assuming] deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. 

The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property, either as a child, a wife, or a concubine, must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. Individual Moslems may show splendid qualities - but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilization of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilization of ancient Rome.""

Englands primary concern was keeping Europe balkanized and preventing one country from gaining to much control of the continent.  France was their main concern in this respect  and as a result they were enemies.  With a growing German threat and finally unification, France had a natural enemy on the continent, which allowed England to not concern itself so much with France. Germany would soon become what France once was and England would take the logical course of action.

Russia emerged as a power in the 18th century and became very involved in European Affairs.  At first England would use Russia as a counter to France, but this started to change in the 19th century as what would become Germany, namely Prussia gained strength.  Russia also began encroaching more deeply into Europe and things like the Crimea war happened, which given the geographical position of the Crimea, was a threat to European stability.

*Facepalm.*

I'm unsure if you're strategically pretending to be stupid or just mightily confused:

0. Production quotas != import tariffs or quotas. (This might well be sufficient, but I'll go on.)

1. Farming in the EU, as in the US, to a significant degree relies on agricultural subsidies.

2. Agricultural subsidies are crutches, artificial supports for uncompetitive products and/or production environments.

3. Limiting agricultural subsidies by imposing production quotas in conjunction with your subsidies (cf. [CAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy)) to ensure you won't be pressured to further and excessively subsidise uncompetitive products in the future is *limiting* the crutches, i.e. it amounts to *removing* artificial supports.

4. If you're an EU farmer and/or HFCS manufacturer, there is, to the best of my knowledge, nothing to stop you from churning out as much HFCS as you like, as long as you make do without subsidies and don't come to your government for help with what you're doing.

5. How you managed to equate the *addition* of crutches that is the imposition of import tariffs and quotas with the *removal* of crutches that is making EU-internal subsidies conditional to adherence to production quotas is beyond me.

Bullshit.

You either choose to go for empowerment, or you choose to play the victim.

Your attempt to have both -- and to push the ""guilt"" button -- doesn't fly with me.

Your statement ""tens of thousands of years of living a certain way"" is utter BS.  To begin with, the people living today have NOT been ""living a certain way"" -- and they definitely haven't been doing so for ""ten thousand years"".

I doubt you can even define what you mean by ""living a certain way"" -- do you mean the Plains Indian Horse culture?  Hardly ten thousand years old because horses were introduced to America by the Spanish.

Now if you want to bitch and moan about the fact that epidemic plagues wiped out the vast majority of Native Americans, I will have no disagreement with a statement of that as a verifiable fact. But as those occurred centuries ago (on the order of 4-5 centuries) they have about as much right to complain as do Northern Europeans have to complain about the Black Plague in the 14th and 15th century.

*Play the victim if you want, but then your people are destined to remain in pretty much the situation they are in -- to use YOUR phrasing, ""stuck on a reservation"".*

&gt;What if someone told you, and your family to get off of their land, learn English, dress appropriately, and farm or get a job after tens of thousands of years of living a certain way which is the anti-thesis of western culture?

Got news for you dipshit. Many of ancestors WERE driven out of their land -- first they had to abandon their old lives (in a land they had lived for centuries) move to Russia/Ukraine, learn a new language, build entirely new communities; only to DRIVEN OFF THAT LAND, so they embarked AGAIN, this time across oceans with their families packed into steerage with little more than what they had on their backs -- to arrive in a new country where they had to learn an entirely new language, and somehow figure out how to travel thousands of miles to a desolate landscape to attempt to scrape out a living and build new homes and new communities.

The problem is that while the EU is capable of speaking with one voice on the issue of Israel the US is not.

The EU is united with one voice over the need to disengage from the current Middle Eastern engagement but unsure about how to do so without leaving the region in a mess, and leaving its ally the US over-exposed.

Yes, but assuming that an anarchist society had the broad approval of the citizenry, it would always be able to amass more force to quash internal problems.

The mafia does not work currently because it is able to acquire more force than the police (it can't), it works because it can be run at arm's length and the leaders can insert a level of plausible deniability that makes it very difficult to rein in, and witnesses as well as victims can be easily intimidated.

&gt;No, he didn't, but Stalin apparently did, as did Pol Pot and Mao. Well, I suppose the latter two didn't quite have the landmass necessary to hide a chain of prisons - they just executed those who they thought might be sentimental towards things like food, like the capitalist swine they obviously were.

This, again, embodies the exact point I was trying to make when I mentioned Marx. Karl Marx was a sociologist. Stalin was a dictator.

Your arguments are very sound, but you are not providing an argument to what I am actually saying. Do you know the difference between socialism and communism? Or Marxism and Maoism? Have you read Das Kapital? Have you ever opened a political science or sociology book? Or are you just going by your conclusions from the history book (which were written by the victors)?

&gt;No? Well then show me ONE communist system that was not totalitarian, that did not silence dissidents, propagandize its populace, that allowed freedom of speech like capitalist nations do. Of course Marx did not PLAN for things to work out that way, but when you concentrate power in the hands of a few, bad things tend to happen.

http://directory.ic.org/records/communes.php

I believe I also mentioned the fact that some socialist states (and when I say 'state', I mean 'country' in layterms. Political scientists say 'state' to make the distinction between a 'nation', a 'state', and a 'nation-state' like America) consistently rank in the top 20 states. I don't think that ONE example is good enough to merit a sound argument, but you invited me to show you ONE communist system that does not silence dissidents.... ,etc.

Sweden. 

But I really don't know what you mean by communist. If a commune isn't communist, and a swedish *kommuner* isn't communist, are you sure we are talking about the same definition of communism? And again, I'm going to fall back on secret argument #22, that I think you are uneducated in political science, and you are only going by what you have learned by consuming American media (and I'll even give you the history book, although I've already stated that the victors write the history).

&gt;No, you fool. I put 'faith' into capitalism because it has created more wealth in the last year than communism created in the last century. 

If you are going to talk about political systems and wealth, you may want to study economics. Your using the wrong term, once again. You're not talking about communism, you're talking about a command market economy. And don't pull your true Scotsman fallacy out of your hat, because I'm not denying any more that Kim Jong Il sucks ass than you are that communism = socialism = command market = totalitarianism.

&gt;I put 'faith' in capitalism because both historically and philosophically, it is the system most compatible with the concept of natural rights, which I hold sacred above all else.

If you are going to talk about political systems and liberty, you may want to study political science. Your using the wrong term again. You're not talking about capitalism, you're talking about Liberalism.... I am not denying any more that John Locke was an enlightened individual than you are that democracy = freedom = capitalism = liberalism.

&gt;I put 'faith' in capitalism precisely because it does not require me to have 'faith' in it for me to believe it works - I can see with my very own eyes that it actually works pretty fucking well, as is evidenced by my incredibly high standard of living, which is higher than 99.99% of people who have ever walked the earth. Capitalism obviously works. Communism, to date, has failed miserably every time it has been tried.

Faith is stupidity, justified. You do not use faith to base your deductions on. You use evidence. The evidence you have provided, your high standard of living, better than 99.99% of people who have ever walked the earth is fabricated in your own mind to supplement your argument. What standard of living are we talking about? Which index are we using? Just like how you measure distance in meters or mass in kilograms, you can use a handful of different indexes to measure standard of living.

 Some people just go by [GDP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)), but if you go by that, China will be near the top. China has a particularly shady human rights track record, so it makes no sense to use GPD, per capita or per nation to measure standard of living. You will agree with me because this evidence supports your argument. We can conclude that GDP is not a good way of comparing standard of living.

The [Heritage Foundation](http://www.heritage.org/Index/) ranks economic freedom. But again, if you are going to go by the economy (command economy vs free market), China and Chile have higher ranks than the US. That can't be right. The US is the best, right?

Or we could go by the [Freedom House](http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=363&amp;year=2009), but again, what is up with Northern Europe? They are certainly socialist nations, but why are they considered free?

Because your understanding of sociology, political science, and economics is limited to your narrow American mindset. You think that communism is socialism is a command market economy is totalitarianism. You don't have the capacity to see that even America has socialist (which in your mind is synonymous to communist, and for the sake of my argument we can continue with that assumption) programs. Social security?

Is it justifiable that a dental chair should cost $25k? if enough people decide not to buy it, and find someone cheaper that'll quickly change.

Problem is, we (here in america) have become accustomed to purchasing stuff on credit. 25k? no problem, think about all that you're going to charge your patients? or so the supplier suggests.

I have another cousin who lives in Belize where people have a really high standard of living. Healthcare is free for every citizen, and hospitals are clean, modern. Procedures are done right away and there are not bureaucracies when it comes to taking care of a patient.

Starting from the last link from WebMD.com, the point of the document is that there are genetic disorders unique to the population. That wouldn't be surprising considering that they practice endogamy, ie they marry within the group. Endogamy isn't an issue in of itself, but due to the relatively small population squeezed into a genetic bottleneck, it accelerates the rate of genetic errors. This can be studied in any medieval European royal family with the Hapsburg Lip as an example where royal intermarriage choked the inflow of new genes and generationally, their chins began protruding more as the lower jaw grew faster.

That said, you claim that the Ashkenazi and Middle Eastern Jews have different genes based on this list of diseases specific to the Askhenazi Jews.

1426207810,0,,t3_ayjoj,t1_c0k5r1t,"This apparently what happens when I try to write a personal letter:

I noticed and delighted to a number of the novel's subtle allusions to comics, both intentional on the part of Mr. Chabon and imagined by myself. You may be aware of them as well. But I'm going to tell you about them anyway. 

The first such allusion was the character of Josef Kavalier. I knew of his funny book inspirations before I cracked the cover. A Mr. Jim Steranko1 was a hugely influential Silver Age artist who had a career as an escape artist before introducing Pop Art to the pages of Nick Fury: Agent of SHEILD. A man mentioned a handful of times in the novel and thanked for everything in its Author's Notes by the name of Jack Kirby  even created the super escape artist Mr. Miracle based on the mysterious Steranko.  Mr. Miracle was created in the seventies though. I think the waning zeitgeist left in the wake of the death of Harry Houdini makes the advent of The Escapist in the 1930s genius. Even though it was accomplished with considerable hindsight.

It makes sense in the context of the novel for a well trained Eastern European Jewish immigrant to be enamored with the American pencil and panel story but it's not entirely historically accurate. Mr. Chabon correctly describes most Golden Age art as, well, shit. Joe's work seems to be based in part on that of WIll Eisner. Eisner was a pioneer of the artform. One of the first artists to break out of the little rectangles, spell out the name of the lead character with the city's buildings, tell the story from the perspective of regular Joes in the streets and alleys the hero stalked and numerous other innovations. He also pioneered the graphic novel with A Contract with God, a Jewey story not unlike Joe's golem epic. The industry's top award is named after him. It's a shame that they let Frank Miller's crazy ass turn Eisner's The Spirit into a cinematic abortion last year.

The aforementioned Jack Kirby (born Jacob Kurtzberg) and his early partner Joe Simon also appear to form the Joe Kavalier pastiche. Both were early luminaries of the industry like everyone else from that period who is still remembered. In 1941 Kirby and Simon created Captain America. His debut issue features Cap seeming to infiltrate a secret Nazi war room to deliver a powerful right cross to the Fürher's chin while stormtroopers futilely fire their machine guns at the hero. Simon and Kirby worked for three of the big companies of the Golden Age: National, Timely and Fawcett. They created The Newsboy Legion and The Boy Commandos for National, which appear to have inspired Kavalier and Clay's boy adventurers The Four Freedoms. At Fawcett, Simon and Kirby worked on Captain Marvel, a character with the wisdom of Solomon and strength of Hercules who was eventually defeated, not by Mr. Mind or Dr. Sivana, but the lawyers of National Publications. 

Almost universally, creators such as Kirby were mistreated by publishers and even other creators, many times worse than Sammy and Joe. The creators of Superman, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, had their byline restored in the seventies  when, on the eve of Richard Donner's blockbuster Superman movie, a lawsuit caused Warner Brothers a PR nightmare when it revealed a near blind Shuster was idling in a California nursing home. They were given a modest pension in addition to the restoration of the creators' byline. Batman co-creator Bill Finger has never had a byline and his name is largely forgotten by people who've seen Nolan's Dark Knight with its forty foot tall ""Batman Created by Bob Kane"" title card. Kane was the artist of the duo and his ideas for Batman weren't particularly spectacular. His original design featured a domino mask like that worn by Robin and Green Lantern. Finger suggested the cowl. He also helped develop characters important to the Batman mythos such as The Joker, Robin and The Riddler. Jack Kirby had most of his Silver Age thunder stolen by the boisterous and omnipresent Stan Lee. They worked in what became known as ""The Marvel Method"" where synopses were provided for the artist, like Sammy did for Rosa's romance books. It's arguable, but now well accepted by certain devoted nerds, that Kirby came up with the better ideas while Stan, through sheer force of personality, got the credit and eventually the Emeritus position with Marvel. Frustrated, Kirby left for DC in the seventies to draw as well as script his New Gods epic which was canceled before completion due to low sales but has become an important aspect of the DC Universe. 

The book is littered with specific coded and explicit references to my sweaty nerd brethren regarding the characters we obsessively study and the meatier people associated with them. Mr. Chabon riffs on the X-Men, animal themed characters who eventually came to be and a brief mention of Timely's new-at-the-time Sub-Mariner and original Human Torch when Joe and Sammy are trying to create their own Superman. Martin Goodman is mentioned, publisher of Timely, which became Atlas and later Marvel where Jack Kirby returned to help imbue the superhero with a pathos that would revolutionize the artform. National Publications/Dectctive Comics, later DC, effectively kills The Escapist through litigation. Sammy's father, The Mighty Molecule, bears more than a passing resemblance to Al Pratt, The Golden Age's Atom. The Atom was just a strong guy of diminutive stature who took to underwear perversion and was a founding member of The Justice Society of America along with Wonder Woman (of whom I'm sure you've at least a passing knowledge). The Atom was also a Jew (probably not originally stated as such though). He sired a hero who also punched people's faces while wearing long underwear years later. 

This is not an uncommon occurrence in the universe of mystery men (the DC universe at least) and it's referred to as a legacy character. After the great evil of the twentieth century had been all but vanquished and the attention of children and immature adults such as myself had turned to stories of crime, pirates and horror for four color entertainment, superheroes other than Batman and Superman really did become very scarce. Possibly more so than in Mr. Chabon's novel. In the mid fifties, rather than creating entirely new characters, DC began reworking its characters from the Golden Age. Beginning with The Flash, no longer a college student who inhaled ""hard water vapors,"" now an entirely different person, a police scientist who was doused with esoteric chemicals and struck by lightning. The Green Lantern became a galactic policeman who drew his power from an ancient race of aliens and their technolgy rather than a train conductor with a magic ring. Hawkman went from a human archaeologist to an alien umm.. policeman again. But he went back and forth between these two origins so many times a moratorium was placed on him until someone could figure out what the fuck was going on with him. There's also a modern trend of legacies. There have been four canonical Robins and the original is currently running around dressed like a bat. And Captain America's little buddy Bucky is carrying the shield and wearing the flag after recovering from a decades long case of off panel death. Tom Mayflower would have been an early though not unprecedented2 example of a legacy character.

I actually wrote a college paper defending violent video games and movies by citing an event from the end of the book: the ""eminent"" and all-too-real Fredric Wertham's appearance, as well as the Senate committee he inspired. The committee is largely seen now as an attempt to run William Gaines and his EC Comics3 line out of business. They mostly published  horror comics including Tales from the Crypt. This actual Senate testimony is oft quoted because it's pretty damn funny:

	KEFAUVER (holding up an especially gory EC Comic title): “This seems to be a man with a 	bloody ax holding a woman’s head up, which has been severed from her body. Do you think 	that is in good taste?”
	GAINES: “Yes sir, I do for the cover of a horror comic. A cover in bad taste might be defined as 	holding the head higher so that the blood could be seen dripping from it.”
	KEFAUVER: “You’ve got blood coming out of her mouth”
	GAINES: “A little.”

After the Senate felt it had sufficiently appeased its constituents, the industry began policing itself with the Comics Code Authority. It banned a number of things' depiction, from drugs to bad guys winning but notably most any occult reference. This effectively put EC and Gaines out of the comics business. But William Gaines changed the dimensions of his one comedy title, Mad, in order to reclassify it as a magazine.

Wertham is called out for idiocy in the book. Batman and Robin is not a ""wish dream of two homosexuals living together"" (well, maybe the movie with that title is). But, I'm not sure of this, he did pick up on one bit of scandal with actual substance. Wonder Woman's original weakness was being put in bondage. Her creator, himself a notable psychologist, William Moulton Marston was supposedly into the bondage found today in self proclaimed dungeons. He was also a polyamorist. But Wertham also claimed that Wonder Woman was a lesbian so picking up on some intentional kinkiness hardly gives his book credibility.

First, freedom. There are plenty of democracies out there, and the Al Qaeda-esque groups aren't attacking all of them. In fact, they probably would prefer democracy in certain Arab countries. They would probably get more support from a democratically elected government in Saudi Arabia than the monarchy they have now. Also, when was the last time you saw them bombing Brazil, South Korea, or other democracies that don't send troops overseas?

Second, religion. Yes, they would probably like it if the whole world converted to their own brand of Islam. But no, that's not their primary goal. If religion was their goal they wouldn't be bombing 'Christian' countries like the US. They would be attacking the more athiestic, nonreligious countries like China, or definitely North Korea. North Korea is a Stalinist state that tolerates no religion except worship of Kim. Yet when was the last time some Islamic terrorist group bombed them?

The reason they chose the US primarily, and Western Europe/westerners in general, is simple: what they see as foreign meddling in their 'holy land.' Quite simply, we have troops in the Middle East and we give significant military support to Israel, which they see, rightly or wrongly, as a colony/crusade/whatever.

Now at various times we've had what we've believed to be very good reasons to support Israel and have troops in the Middle East. Whether to liberate Kuwait from Saddam, protect our oil supplies, control the influence of Iran, any number of things. 

The thing is, these people are religious nutjobs. We have have a fair number of nutjobs in our own country, so it's not something unique to them. Still, these people think this particular plot of dirt is sacred, granted by the all-powerful omnipotent creator of the universe to the followers of Islam. Anyone who isn't a Muslim and sets foot there is an invader, a heretic, etc., and should be attacked with the utmost effort.

Now this doesn't excuse what they do. The people who planned and executed 9/11 did that themselves, whatever their motives, there is no excuse. Still, we have to consider this in our geopolitical calculations. As long as we have a military presence in the Middle East and continue to support Israel, we WILL be attacked. It's that simple. Is it worth it? Well, probably not.

For what it's costing us in money alone, 700 billion/year in defense spending, it wouldn't be too difficult to render the Middle East irrelevant. Even if you just take a third of the budget, $200 billion/year. You could quite easily build enough electric car charging stations, algae biofuel production, whatever, to completely replace every drop of imported oil. The technology exists to phase out oil; oil is just cheaper than the alternatives. However, the price at the pump doesn't include all the cost in blood, treasure, and international conflict it takes to ensure a reliable supply. And let's not kid ourselves.

There are only like 5 or so major studios in Oslo, and they're barely over 20 people.

&gt; I was hoping that you'd be mature here and accept that you were unaware of how the tearm ""health"" was used in the field of evolution.

Why don't you enlighten me with some credible sources. 

&gt;  Features like facial symmetry, large breasts, big muscles, height, healthy looking hair, healthy looking eyes, healthy looking skin, wide hips, long legs, certain scents, etc etc... We are also able to enhance these features with things like make-up, jewellery, perfume and other things.

Yes, make up, and perfume can be used to enhance bodily features, but not jewelry. That is just ridiculous. In fact burka can be attractive to men. Just like some men in west like nice girls and geeky book worm type girls, many men probably feel that traditional woman with burka is more pure 

&gt; The exact same things that make me think it's unacceptable for any New Zealander to do

But you would not think that white New Zelander is not a New Zelander, that he does not have a right to his opinions, or that he does not belong in a country. 

&gt; Radical Muslims get away with repressing women in ways that would quickly see any non-Muslim appearing in court. We turn a blind eye to the misogyny and crime happening in their communities. We shouldn't be doing that. They should be expected to live up to the same standards that everyone else, from many varied cultures, have no problem living up to.

You actually believe that Muslims have it easy in the west? WTF! They are continuously discriminated against. In Europe Muslims life in ghettos and slums and they face continuous discrimination, violence and mistrust.

&gt; I would certainly hope so. Some of the Orthodox Jews can be terribly repressive to women, and if they're oppressing their women to a point in violation of the law, they too should be denied citizenship.

Well this Muslims man did not break any laws, so should he have gotten his citizenship? 

&gt; I think that the fact most attention is on the Muslims is because they seem to be repressing their women much more, and in a much more public fashion than others do. 

I have seen no reason to believe that. Women are oppressed all over third world, but for some reason focus seems to be on Muslims, more than other ethnicities. Oppression of women depends on education and standard of living, and as long as you keep advocating discrimination and targeting of Muslims, longer they will stay poor and primitive. 

&gt; It's not quite that women do things that don't make sense. Once you understand that many women (possibly for the evolutionary reasons proposed as an answerfor Stockholm syndrome) are passive, and will do things to not make males angry, then it makes sense why they'd do some things that they'd be better off not doing. 

But just because it makes sense to you, that does not mean that this is what is happening. You totally seem to ignore the fact that you have to prove your claim. Instead of proof, all you give are more claims and then you berate me for not believing you. You have given me no reason to believe. Anyone can make claims and argument. 

Almost everyone would be uncomfortable in public wearing nothing but underwear. Therefore it makes sense that a woman that grew up wearing burka would feel uncomfortable in a lesser state of dress. There is no need to resort to abuse and stocholm syndrome when simpler and more likely explanation is readily available. Just like any guy in the west would feel uncomfortable wearing womans dress in public, burka wearing woman may feel uncomfortable dressing in a way she is not used to. 

Just as some women wear burka, other women wear jewelry. Poking a hole in the ear and hanging a piece of metal will in no way enhance any of their bodily features. So why do women do it? Because that is a cultural norm. And explaining individual cultural norms with evolution is silly. 

&gt; Wearing the burka or niqab, they'd certainly be better off not doing as it can have terrible health effects.

Freedom, independence, and rebellion against (unreasonable) authority are at the forefront.  These themes the movies pretty much bludgeoned the viewer to death at different points, but that doesn't make them less valid.  Pirates love the open ocean, the freedom inherent in it, the self-sufficiency.  The idea that one is beholden to no one.  Except, pirates are beholden.  To the elements, each other, and themselves.  As mentioned, they are not lawless, though when you put enough people together that don't like authority, you will have bumps, as we have.  The stances against authority, tyranny really, are also evident.  The most poignant scene for me was at the start of the 3rd one, where the guy is reading off the list of suspended rights, and hanging everyone.  Like I said, bludgeon.

Now the inevitable counterarguments.  First my favorite, which this post mentions.  Now, I do give credit for saying that we ***don't*** pillage and murder.  But do we seriously think that that is gonna be the first impression people get?  And more to the point, does anyone believe that we are yoking ourselves to such terrible things by embracing a name?  I am hesitant to label, but I can only conclude that someone taking that stance is just a troll.  The assertion is that ridiculous to me.  Yes pirates were not nice people.  Ok worse than not nice.  Whoopie shit.  I don't know if you follow the news, but the US is not exactly nice on all fronts either.  And some of the people we do business with?  Downright evil.  So how about a little perspective?

Now about the European Pirate Party.  Yeah, it seems pretty clear there is some inspirational link there.  So what?  It's not what we stand for.  Someone pointed out that it's not even in our platform.  And why should it be?  I think on that front, as an aside, we should focus more on fair use.  But we now symbolize something greater; we stand for more than a few free movies.  We are leading the charge against the tyrannies of corruption, demagoguery, and disconnection from the people.

This [here](http://www.primermagazine.com/2009/learn/the-science-of-sexy-how-evolution-drives-our-lust) seems like a rather good article on the subject.

&gt;Yes, make up, and perfume can be used to enhance bodily features, but not jewelry. That is just ridiculous. In fact burka can be attractive to men. Just like some men in west like nice girls and geeky book worm type girls, many men probably feel that traditional woman with burka is more pure

I do not think that the burka would be a sign of purity, but rather one of subservience. A woman that will acquiesce to wear such a thing is likely to be very passive, which unfortunately most males prefer (I myself prefer strong minded obstreperous and intelligent women).

Certainly there is more than just physical appearance that we humans find appealing. Many women seem very attracted to men that can make them laughing. And bookworm girls, are for me, certainly my type (I really must try to spend more time at the library to try to meet a nice girl). It would seem, given the largeness of human brains, that intelligence is an appealing trait, there seems to have been a rather rapid evolution in the size of the human brain, or it could just because that it offered increased survival benefit rather than direct sexual appeal.

&gt;But you would not think that white New Zelander is not a New Zelander, that he does not have a right to his opinions, or that he does not belong in a country.

If the person, whether European, Asian, Indian, Maori, Hindu, Muslim, Christian, or whatever, has citizenship then they're a New Zealander. We would often say that someone is ""not a New Zealander"" in the kind of not-a-true-Scotsman way, if their opinions and actions are considered unbecoming of a New Zealander. Being a modern secular society we value free speech, sexual equality and freedom, we despise racism and bigotry, etc. If you're not a citizen, and you want to be, yet you despise our values and engage in the kinds of actions that we despise, then I wouldn't have a problem with you being denied citizenship. Down in the South of New Zealand we have problems with a very conservative Christian cult, the exclusive Brethren, who are very oppressive towards women. I don't think that we should tolerate that. But just because we do, does not mean that we should tolerate further oppression of women, it may be hypocritical, but the problem is our tolerance of this Christian cult, not our intolerance of oppressive Muslims.

&gt;You actually believe that Muslims have it easy in the west? WTF! They are continuously discriminated against. In Europe Muslims life in ghettos and slums and they face continuous discrimination, violence and mistrust.

The moderate Muslims find they have no problems. These religious ghettos are in large part problems that they have caused themselves, just like horrible crime riddled Christian neighbourhoods. Most Muslims have life very easy in the West, because we in the West wish to allow people the freedom to believe what they want, so long as it doesn't violate some of our basic values such as sexual equality. The Muslims that claim persecution are typically problematic Muslims, just the same as the problematic Christians that claim persecution. When either Christians or Muslims are claiming persecution because the law punishes them for their bigotry towards homosexuals for instance, then they've brought it upon themselves. Religion is no excuse for violating the basic principles that we have in modern societies.

&gt;Well this Muslims man did not break any laws, so should he have gotten his citizenship?

If he made his wife dress this way, and there is good reason, as I've been saying all along, to believe he has. Then he has broken laws.

&gt;I have seen no reason to believe that. Women are oppressed all over third world, but for some reason focus seems to be on Muslims, more than other ethnicities. Oppression of women depends on education and standard of living, and as long as you keep advocating discrimination and targeting of Muslims, longer they will stay poor and primitive.

This is because you live in the States (at least you seem to have indicated that) and from what I know, burka or niqab clad women are very rare. You have not seen these very public displays of oppression. If you had lived in a very multicultural society, where people of many cultures had all got along very well, and then one group came along and refused to become a part of it and started oppressing their women in very public ways, I think you too would have a problem with it. Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists and others can in general get along in our society in New Zealand without problem, but the radical Muslim communities which have been growing want to increasingly cut themselves off from this society and ignore laws that try to guarantee things like sexual equality.

&gt;Just as some women wear burka, other women wear jewelry. Poking a hole in the ear and hanging a piece of metal will in no way enhance any of their bodily features. So why do women do it? Because that is a cultural norm. And explaining individual cultural norms with evolution is silly.

We chose the boat for its small size; the smaller boats generally seemed to have the better guides, plus you wouldn't have to wait for some fat tourists to get into the 18 boats for massive field trips to shore (plus, screaming kids tend to scare animals).  I don't recall the exact itinerary, although I've been meaning to plot it from my map sometime; if you're very interested, I can check through my photo archive (loads) and give you the island names.  It was a counterclockwise 7-day itinerary in any case.  The guide, crew, and other guests were great -- even the kids were very well behaved and interested.  My only regret is not having had my 5DMkII along (I was still on my 350D with a single 17-85mm and I _still_ haven't gotten around to rating, geotagging, and sorting all my photos from that massive trip.)

&gt; While it is widely assumed that the word ""football"" (or ""foot ball"") references the action of the foot kicking a ball, there is a historical explanation, which is that football originally referred to a variety of games in medieval Europe, which were played on foot.[1] These games were usually played by peasants, as opposed to the horse-riding sports often played by aristocrats.

So while the rest of the world calls it ""football"" and assumes that means a foot kicking a ball, it is actually because peasants used to play it on foot rather than on horse like the rich people.  That variety of games (American football, soccer, and rugby) all originated there and have a stake to the name ""football"".

I'll call it football and soccer when discussing with a fellow American for our sake of clarity.  If I talked to someone from any other country, ""football"" is the universally known term for our game of soccer so I would abide by that term.

Linked to that is America's adoption of the position of King of The World, in order to export your religion and import other people's oil. Again, Britain (well, England) and Europe went through all that centuries ago and it was pretty miserable by all accounts.

All humans are of one species. Of course there are no dividing lines, otherwise they couldn't mate effectively and produce offspring and you'd have to divide between humans and other kinds of humans. Yet there are clear differences from one defined race to another.

Maybe you don't quite understand much about biology but take a look at [this](http://www.uwgb.edu/heuerc/2D/Color_circle_%28hue-sat%29.png).

On this picture you see colors, all colours you are able to see within the visible spectrum of ligt are basically the same: A certain wavelength of electromagnetic radiation.

Now choose any one colour of these and move your finger, you will notice that the change from yellow to orange isn't that big of a step... but moving from yellow all the way to blue makes a huge difference.

The same applies to everything within nature and especially good to genetics and evolution as humans evolve step by step, always carrying with them their old genes. You can mix them up pretty well, as well as you can mix up yellow and orange, yet they are clearly different. They can reproduce and combine like colours: Take an African and an Asian genotype and its offspring will look a bit African and a bit Asian. Add a Caucasian type and its offspring bears 3 kinds of distinct racial features.

If you exmine the children of a north African and a south European, you won't get a much different looking offspring as it is similar to mixing yellow with another kind of yellow.

O DEMOEX e o piratpartiet são dois partidos políticos diferentes
registrados na suécia. E DEMOEX e piratpartiet não tem quase nada em
comum. Primeiro que o piratpartiet é uma organização pautada por
princípios políticos e o demoex é uma organização pautada por MÉTODOS políticos. Podemos considerar o demoex como uma metodologia despolitizada já que não escolhe prioridades e princípios políticos. A idéia do movimento dos partidos piratas no mundo se baseia nessas prioridades de se levar certas questões que são importantes para o século XXI mas que são negligenciadas nos parlamentos. De fato, a idéia da democracia direta é negligenciada também, mas ela vai de encontro com a própria idéia de Partido Político e a idéia de
representatividade dos parlamentos. O demoex pode ser comparado a uma propaganda anti-cristã dentro da igreja católica, para tomar um
exemplo. O demoex também não se propõe a estabelecer prioridades, como estabelecer uma nova política para a Propriedade Intelectual ou para a liberdade de expressão porque depende de todo um hal de fatores que fazem as pessoas, que votarão diretamente nas questões, escolherem uma questão como prioritária. Nesse sentido, o demoex é uma expressão diferente da mesma idéia de parlamento que temos atualmente cujo as frentes políticas de maior expressão (como os social-democratas) tem um hal de prioridades amplo e difuso. Considerando que o piratpartiet tenha um conjunto de prioridades específicas e bem pontuais, aplicar um sistema demoex de política é adotar outra estratégia que não é propriamente a escolha de prioridades mas a escolha de um método que se presupõe que irá levar as prioridades. Mas isso não ocorre, como expliquei.

Além disso, existe uma série de críticas ao demoex, visto por alguns
como apenas um projeto acadêmico, e por outros como ""um site na
internet"". De fato, a crítica principal é o reduzido número de
participantes das votações online que não chega nem perto do total de
pessoas que elegeram o representante demoex nas eleições comuns. O que acontece é que o sistema de votação representativa é muito mais
expressivo com relação ao número de participantes que as posteriores
votações online que ocorrem no ""ambito"" do demoex.

Isso tudo me faz entender que esse não é o momento de uma democracia líquida ampla tendo em vista que isso exige uma outra cultura. Isso exigiria uma cultura livre, algo que estamos um pouco distantes. As pessoas gostariam sim de participar de votações diretas, no entanto, não é apenas essa questão do método. O que ocorre atualmente no Brasil são eleições diretas (mesmo que de representantes) e as pessoas ainda não ""aprenderam a votar"" na maioria dos casos. As pessoas tem pouca informação sobre a política e o governo é pouco transparente. Sequer a política faz parte do cotidiano, exceto de maneira vaga no telejornal.
Então, eu acredito que antes de um MÉTODO  ou uma máquina, as pessoas tem que ser capazes de operá-la. Tem que ter autonomia para decidir as as questões, ou seja, ter informação sobre essas questões. Sem isso, o que vai se criar é apenas uma versão reduzida do que o nosso parlamento (camara+senado) que de fato, negligencia muitas questões.

Basically, kids in Europe learn how to form sentences out of their component parts, and put those parts together into the proper structure. Once it comes to learning English, all they need to do is to learn some new words, and the way the construction methods differ between the two languages.

British kids, right, like, don't learn stuff like that, like adverbs and verbs and that. It's all, like, what they know, yeah?

My point is, that without a proper grounding in how a language is supposed to work (which European children receive and which British children do not), then learning a second language is impossible. For at least thirty years, probably longer, British schools have been failing to teach children how the English language works. Because of this, such teaching needs to be provided during the learning of the second language, but since British children do not learn these lessons with the benefit of a proper grounding in English, the information they get from them has no context.

Didn't Israel make nukes and give the world the middle finger already? Don't they give the world the middle finger every time the UN passes a resolution against them, usually dealing with their occupation of Palestine and their constant violation of their rights as human beings? 

The fact of the matter, according to all of the people who would actually know, is that Iran is enriching uranium for their civilian nuclear power plant projects, which they are trying to make so they can use *that* for energy and free up more fossil fuels for export so they can grow their economy and stop being a mostly 3rd world nation. What the US and Israel wants them to do is give all of that up over *fear*. 

&gt;We all know that Israel will be the first to suffer should Iran get its hands on some nukes.

First of all, that's bullshit because Iran isn't stupid. Even if they *did* get nukes they wouldn't use them against a nuclear armed Israel because that would be national suicide. You can think they're all crazy extremists over there, but that's just the bigotry talking, nothing factual. And who will be the first nation or people to suffer at the hands of *Israeli* nukes, huh? Did you know they have a nuclear first strike policy?

&gt;History has taught us that the world does jack shit until something horrible happens

If you've ever taken a history class about the Arab-Israeli conflict like *I* have (several times), then you'd understand that the crazy assholes who created and are now running Israel *are that horrible thing that's happening*. They're bringing *all* Israelis down with them too, which is unfortunate since many are not so evil (but many are).

&gt;while it's all occuring right under their noses yet again.

Yeah, except this time it's the *Israelis* who are behind it, not the victims of it. Did you read that article about why the Jewish Holocaust victim is a supporter of Palestinian rights? Yeah, there's a *reason* for things like that. Israel is an apartheid, almost Nazi-like, rogue state. The whole world, save the US, recognizes that. If there was something of value with Israel's borders, or if the Palestinians had enough political power in countries like the US or Britain, then we'd have dealt with Israel long ago. However, since there is nothing to gain by such action, it will never happen, no matter how much it *should* happen.

&gt;This is an act of defense. If the world won't stop Iran, Israel has to.

You don't see how Orwellian comments like that are? Israel has to attack Iran for *self-defense?* Iran has made zero offensive threats against Israel. Israel has made dozens. Who's threatening whom?

Budget as much as possible. Save save save save save. Spend as little as possible while traveling, but NEVER pass up an opportunity because it may be a little more expensive (within reason). Chances are this is your one shot to Skydive in the Alps (a couple hundred in Interlachen) or zipline through a canyon, or spend days wandering the Louvre, Go caving, etc.   Always have backup cash. 

Eat cheap most of the time, but always splurge for one ""good"" meal in each locale you visit. The gastronomy is one of the best parts of traveling. Do this smart though; a local vineyard in Germany or France can have better food than the fancy restaurant in Munich or Paris, for much less as well...

Have an Itinerary of things that are important to you, and plan to throw it out the window. Know where you want to go and what you would like to see; but you will be meeting people and sharing the experience with these people will be amazing. Be open to their suggestions. Meet other backpackers and pick their brains. See where they have been and what they recommend. They will give you much better tips than Lonely Planet ever could. 

If you can afford it, get an unlimited Eurorail. Being able to hop a train whenever you like opens up a world of spontaneous travel. Also, when money gets thin you can start to schedule overnight trains. Book a couchette (there is a reservation fee for this; typically around 20$), and spend the night on a train. Not only are you getting somewhere, but you are also getting cheap accomodations!

Buy groceries! Streetfood adds up!  Most hostels have kitchen facilities you can use. Go buy some pasta and sauce. Ramen. Bread and hard cheeses and a Hard meat (Salami keeps well in a backpack)  When you see free condiments (Jelly, mayo, kethup packets, etc) take some and keep them in a ZipLock. You would be amazed at how good a day old baguette and salami can taste when you are starving after a long day of travel. Also, buy beer for the Train rides; have a couple bottles in your pack. It's a great way to make friends (offer them said beer)

Scan in copies of your Passport, Credit Cards, ID's, Plane Tickets, and any other official document you are carrying. Upload to your WebMail.  If your bag/moneybelt gets stolen you can access these in your WebMail and print out copies. This will GREATLY expedite your local consulate getting you a new copy of the documents. 

Meet locals, befriend them. You never know who will offer you a couch, a meal, a deal, or a lifelong friendship. 

Be open to new experiences (obviously)

and about a million other tips. 

Keep in mind you are going where many other people have gone before; and that people are generally decent human beings. Dont be stupid, don't put yourself in dangerous situations, and just be smart. It's a lot less scary than you think!!
