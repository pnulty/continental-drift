Only if you compare nameplate power capacity, *maybe*, which is meaningless since wind has a third the capacity factor of nuclear.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor#Typical_capacity_factors

E.g.:

$4.03B for new 1.0 gigawatt wind farm:

http://uk.reuters.com/article/behindTheScenes/idUKTRE4BI1V120081219

$5.1B for new 1.65 gigawatt nuclear reactor:

http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/08/17/europe/energy.php

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamanville_Nuclear_Power_Plant

But adjust for capacity factor: the reactor will average some 1.4 GWe, whereas the wind farm will average 0.4 GWe at most. So in this comparison, the wind farm is about three times more expensive in construction cost.

As for amortized lifespan costs, see for yourself:

It seems like giving me ""a link for Islamic antisemitism in the 19th century"" is kind of like *you* ""making the mistake of thinking the Palestinans and the Jews are separate races or people"", not me. The truth is, *they* think of themselves as different races or people, Semitic as they both are. I guarantee both sides would deny that they are related to each other, so what it comes down to is just a battle of two different religious groups, which makes sticking up for either side rather pointless. They're both religious fanatics who depend on faith instead of reason and that goes to explain why they're so completely dysfunctional.

And, if they're both the same ethnic group and most of the Jews left after the Romans conquered Israel... they're fighting themselves. Only, most of the ones that stuck around converted to Islam, so they see them as a different ethnic group (which is half-true because the Jews that left in the Diaspora undoubtedly bred with the Europeans and the Jews that stayed undoubtedly bred with the Persians). So, basically, it just goes back to religion, and yes, I agree, the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians is like two children fighting over who gets to live in their dead parents house.

The first is that American culture, by definition, values expenditures at the individual level --whether it be for charity or otherwise-- over expenditures on a governmental level.  More so than any other industrialized nation, the US as a whole distrusts its government's ability to spend charitable money wisely.  I don't say that this is a good or a bad thing, I simply observe that it is so.   

The second point to make is that the US spends more on military expenditures than all other industrialized nations combined.  One can make of that what they will, but the fact is, that since the US is acting as a sort of global policeman, all the other industrialized nations are not obliged to spend accordingly.  This means that they have, not necessarily *more* to give, but rather, a bit more lee-way.  In all fairness I think it ought to be taken into consideration before we issue blanket condemnations of what we imagine the US is or is not.  

The dirty truth is that US military power is *exactly* what keeps the global trade system functioning.  It's a role that the US inherited from the Royal Navy after WWII, and one that is, at least on Reddit, a largely thankless task.  You take away US military power, and who will fill the vacuum?

Of course, there are multiple sides to this coin as well. It is true that American military dominance is necesarry to contain nuclear powers on the Asian main-land, but this is not the main focus of the US military policy.
The burden the US has to carry is only a fraction of the burden it chooses to carry. 

The criticism towards US policy concerns those cases where the need for military action (whether offensive or defensive) is not very clear. Terrorism is the primary example. The primitive reaction that satisfies our hormones is to strike back, but in reality there is hardly anything a soldier can do to decrease this threat. Yet there is quite a lot active diplomacy and public relations (e.g. charity) could achieve in this case. In many ways it is barbaric to choose military action when that is not the best option. The 'liberal' view expressed by most reddit users is simply to resist the barbarism and make the right choice.

This should not be confused with the European view. Due to their fortunate lack of a military burden their policy and mainstream view aligns with the liberal view.

While I certainly don't want to defend Hamas it appears the Rafah crossing was closed off by Israeli mandate after hamas took control because Israel does not recognize Hamas while the open Rafah crossing was a negotiation between Israel and the Palestinian authority.

also 
from B'Tselem:

&gt;Also, Israel could close the crossing down by preventing the EU monitors from getting to the crossing, given that the agreement stipulated the crossing would not be opened in the absence of the monitors. When Israel informed the monitors of a security warning that necessitated closing of the crossing, the monitors did not take their positions at the crossing and it remained closed. Since the abduction of Cpl. Shalit, Israel has used this method to prevent orderly movement at the crossing. In doing so, it imposes an almost total siege on the Gaza Strip, with nobody entering or leaving.

I wouldn't put it past hamas, if the Palestinians aren't feeling desperate enough to give Hamas their support then hamas would probably find a way to create that desperation.

business,t1_8329,,0,1428222227,False,t3_7mro1,,t1_843c,t5_2qgzg,"It works like this. In a country goods and services are produced and traded. Via the central bank and commercial banks of that country money is injected (as debt) into society to accommodate for the trading of those goods and services.

Here's a small example:
If there would only be 2 people and 2 goods in a country, the goods being 1 fish and 1 potato and someone would borrow $100 in that country's economy from a bank, then there would be 1 fish, 1 potato and a $100 bill in that country.
Consequently the fish or the potato would be worth $100.
The number 100 however does not matter here, what matters is that there is only 1 piece of paper in circulation that has 100 stamped on it which functions as a medium of exchange.

The problem however starts here. When the central bank starts printing 10 hundred dollar bills. Then the fish and the potato become worth 10 hundred dollar bills and thus $1000.
Technically the fish and potato have the same value, namely 1 fish is worth 1 potato when traded without a currency as a medium of exchange. However what has dropped in ""value"" is the paper bill. 1 paper bill is no longer worth 1 fish or 1 potato.

And that's the key between currency values. The value of a currency is measured by how much goods and services are produced by the country/economy of the currency versus the produced amount of that currency.

Comparing this to the dollar and pound means that the central banks of the US and UK started printing more money in the last period. Much more than the expansion of goods and services in their countries. The EU also expanded their money supply, so the Euro also devalued, however the US and UK printed so much more money in proportion to the EU, that the Dollar and Pound declined even faster than the Euro. That's why people see the Euro as a stronger currency, because with 1 Euro you can buy more goods or services in the EU than you can buy in the US with 1 Dollar.

So the numeric value of a currency is the proportional link between the amount of goods and services which can be traded for that currency versus the amount of goods and services that can be traded for in another currency.

If all loans in society would be paid back to the banks, there would be no money in society. People would have to barter goods and services.(directly trade them)

Now you might ask yourself. If all money in society is a pool of loans, then where do the people get the interest to pay those loans? Because banks don't just want their money back, they want interest on top of it.

Here's the answer. Every year banks produce more and more money to give out more and more loans. It's called expansion of the money supply. That yearly expansion of the money supply is what people pay their interest with.
The rate at which the money supply expands is called inflation and if the rate of inflation is higher than the rate of expansion of goods and services, then a currency becomes worth less than before.

The paper money you know today was for hundreds of years something else. It wasn't ""money"" it was a paper receipt.

price for Europe is tied to the price of oil with some lag, that is, current price depends on average price of oit about a half year ago. price for Ukraine is fixed and is somewhat discounted comparing to European -- partially because Ukraine won't be able to pay full price, partially to keep Ukraine geopolitically loyal to Russian, and partially because Russia also gets discounted transit price.

as Ukraine gets more aligned with western countries and less loyal to Russia (it even partially supported Georgia in recent conflict), it gets less discounts each year and is going to end up with a full market price in a few years.

this year Putin offered price of $250 per thousand cubic meters, that seems to be a discounted price comparing to 2008 European prices, but prices for 2009 would be much lower as oil prices got lower in the end of 2008, so this price Putin offered is not discounted at all. at same time Gazprom demands deeply discounted transit prices. so it is no wonder that contracts were not signed -- Russia's offers are deeply disadvatageous. and Ukraine cannot find any other gas supplier.. but it has some reserves, at least..

why did Russia offer such disadvantageos contract prices is a question. to punish Ukraine for messing with Georgia and NATO? to lower it afterwards to look generous? end up with compromise solution?

another possibility, Russia is afraid from getting hit from lower oil prices, and therefore wants to make new contracts as profitable as possible.

as for Ukrainian debt, it have payed for all gas delivered through the year, indeed, but Russia claims some more $600m as penalties for late payment. while they might be technically correct, this year conditions were pretty bad -- global crisis, credit crunch etc., Naftogaz was not able to get a loan to pay for the gas to make reserves in winter (it has to make reserves for the winter when consumption is higher, but it has troubles financing it as consumers to not pay in advance), and get a huge hit from hryvna devaluing; and it cannot quickly move to a higher, ""market-value"" prices for consumers because there are lots of poor people who won't be able to afford heating their houses then, and bussiness cosumers already got huge hit this year from shrinking demand for their products.. so bitching about late payments in such situation is not very good, and it might mean worsening relations between countries.

P.S. one more clue on why Gazprom wants Naftogaz to pay all debts in full ASAP -- it have offered to make advance payment for transits so this money can be used for repaying debt. besides that, this in-advance payment will make transit price fixed and low for year 2009. so it seems it doesn't really need that money, they just want to have higher profits in 2009.",True,,85sq,True,0,1230829222,killerstorm,28,28,0

* Eastern Europe will catch many by surprise. Russia an Ukraine will be in dire straits however, most new EU members will post GDP growth figures in the 3-6% range.
* USA will remain in the doldrums with housing prices falling and recovery not appearing on the horizon until the 4Q 2009. Canada will keep the US company in misery but with less turmoil and slower price declines. Unemployment there will be consistently higher than in the US however.
* China will suffer in the first half of 2009 mostly by feeling lack of external demand. This will force them to spend some of their surplus at home to drive up the demand domestically. They may engage in some sort of massive public works program.
* Ireland will be the biggest economic casualty among the EU15 nations. Their newfound wealth will be exposed as a Ponzi scheme much like that of Iceland. The UK will be shafted but not as bad as Ireland. Germany will be relatively unscathed as their cultural aversion to credit means they've flushed out of the system most of the shite credit.
* There will not be a large conflict in the Middle East. Also there won't be a terror attack of any significance in the western world. India-Pakistan relations will be the most serious international crisis of 2009. Followed by tension between Russia and one of her neighbors. Either Poland or Ukraine.
* A disruptive technology will come along and boost interest in internet startups. This will most likely be an application of weak AI in pattern recognition. Most likely some sort of pattern recognition algorithm that will find application in network security and data mining of all social data gathered by web 2.0 companies like facebook or reddit.
* Clean energy will remain the unfulfilled promise. The most worthwhile alt energy projects will be around boosting insulation not generating electricity from wind and sun.
* Obama will be hailed as a miracle worker because of a lack of an all out collapse in the US economy. His stimulus will add to debt and provide a bit of cushion for the worst affected states but will do little else to boost the economy. He will make one rookie mistake in foreign relations for which he will be castigated by the right wing talk radio. The republicans will manufacture a mini scandal connected with his stimulus plan.

2. When Q4 numbers are released, they will be devastating. We closed out the Dow with a 34% loss in a year. I'm aware that basic indexes are not the best indicator of economic prosperity - but in this case they will be the canary in the cage.

3. At least another 50 banks will fail. There was a post from LewRockwell.com a while ago - and while I generally dislike their posts due to lack of concrete information - they ran the Texas ratio on a rather huge number of banks. I can not dispute their numbers, as those numbers are the same ones that I come up with. If this is true, we have banks hovering over 400 on the ratio. I can not underscore how major that is enough times without it becoming a strike tag.

4. Oil will continue to step down, creating problems in the Middle East nations that need the price to be $(X) per barrel without risking deficit. As this is going on, Russia will begin to tighten the grip on non-Arab oil for EU nations. 

5. The Q4's should force many more major chains to go into a state of bankruptcy, failure, or eligibility to be bailed (or bought) out.

6. At least 10 major cities will declare bankruptcy.

7. Housing will not bottom this year. An additional $10k to $20k loss on house values will start to weigh on home owners who begin to see no foreseeable end in sight to the loss of their home investment.

8. The dollar will begin devaluing in Q2'09.

9. California is going to bleed in a way that only multiple millions of dollars will tourniquet. 

10. The mainstream media will continue to focus as little on this as humanly possible. Reporting from our adventures in the sand will be a historical novel in comparison to the lack-of-fact fable that is reported. So - on a bright note, at least some things will stay the same.

You really shouldn't push AIDS as a dangerous issue to white hetro people. It just isn't, and no amount of P.C. MTV spots makes that true. Herpes OTOH, is rampant in suburbia, and gross enough to make kids wear rubbers is shown as a large risk to them.

* Eastern Europe will catch many by surprise. Although Russia and Ukraine will be in dire straits, most new EU members will post GDP growth figures in the 3-6% range.
* USA will remain in its doldrums with housing prices falling further and recovery not appearing on the horizon until the 4Q 2009. Canada will keep the US company in misery but with less turmoil and slower price declines. Unemployment there will be consistently higher than in the US however.
* China will suffer in the first half of 2009 mostly by feeling lack of external demand. This will force them to spend some of their surplus at home to drive up the demand domestically. They may engage in some sort of massive public works program.
* Ireland will be the biggest economic casualty among the EU15 nations. Their newfound wealth will be exposed as a Ponzi scheme much like that of Iceland. The UK will be shafted but not as bad as Ireland. Germany will be relatively unscathed as their cultural aversion to credit means they've flushed out of the system most of the shite credit.
* There will not be a large conflict in the Middle East. Also there won't be a terror attack of any significance in the western world. India-Pakistan relations will be the most serious international crisis of 2009. Followed by tension between Russia and one of her neighbors. Either Poland or Ukraine.
* A disruptive technology will come along and boost interest in internet startups. This will most likely be an application of weak AI in pattern recognition. Most likely some sort of pattern recognition algorithm that will find application in network security and data mining of all social data gathered by web 2.0 companies like facebook or reddit.
* Clean energy will remain the unfulfilled promise. The most worthwhile alt energy projects will be around boosting insulation not generating electricity from wind and sun.
* Steve Jobs will die of recurrent pancreatic cancer
* A completely synthetic life form will be created in a lab. Most likely by transplanting 100% artificial DNA into a vector like e-coli. That or it will be an RNA based very primitive proto cell capable of replicating and dividing
* Obama will be hailed as a miracle worker because of lack of an all out collapse in the US economy. His stimulus will add to debt and provide a bit of cushion for the worst affected areas but will do little else to boost the economy.

You just **cannot** be too green. For God's sake, before humanity came along there were a lot more forests and green lush fields than there are now! You seem to think that parking lots and motorways *improve* the look of a place? That is completely retarded, motorways are an eyesore and contribute to noise and light pollution disturbing the local wildlife. 

If nature has put those colours together, then they don't clash. Have you ever seen the Orion Nebula? Beautiful, positively amazing. The galaxy has a far wider range of colours than Earth, why don't you go and pave over that?

&gt; Personally I think some of those walking routes (in the lake district, peak district etc..) would benefit from being properly paved, in fact if they were properly paved and widened sufficiently they would become very popular country drives and be a real benefit to the economy.

Part of the fun of going for a walk is meeting nature - next you're going to recommend guard rails and shops along the route. If you can't walk along the current lovely stone and mud paths, then you aren't much use as a walker. If you expect everything to be paved and widened for your convenience then you aren't much use as a contribution to society either.

&gt; If this concrete is as effective as it seems, then it would be a shame not to use as much of it as possible. The British should stop using outdated technology like brick and stone for walling their houses and slate for roofing.

Outdated technology? Are you serious? Brick and stone are coming back in style, after the 70s had an outbreak of ugly concrete blocks all over the place. 

&gt; Switching to concrete and then hiring local artists to paint the desired texture on would be far more pleasant and would permit more diversity (and again benefit the local economy), especially if existing buildings, say those over 50 years old, could be demolished and replaced by these 'eco-crete' dwellings.

But won't painting over the concrete negate its surface area, therefore reducing the carbon dioxide that it emits? The only way this can be used effectively is on motorways and roads, cancelling out the emissions from cars. Brick and stone houses are wonderful and add real charm to a community, and depth to the buildings. Mere paintings cannot convey this beauty; merely one of the reasons I dislike American wooden houses, all painted to look like gumdrops.

&gt; the current insistence on all this greenery and keeping 'historic' buildings in place is just political correctness gone mad, indeed it is largely due to foreigners from Europe dictating to us (and in some cases coming over here and taking our jobs!).

Let me interpret why I think antisemitism annoys people. The term ""antisemitism"" annoys people because it succinctly reminds European (and other) nations what they have done repeatedly to Jews not just 60 years ago but also in Stalin's Russia, and in Spain a few hundred years earlier. 

Here's a timeline of antisemitism:

http://wapedia.mobi/en/Timeline_of_antisemitism

Most people know about German antisemitism because it is probably the biggest crime against us in absolute terms, but they don't remember what happened in other countries. Almost every European nation, with no exception so far as I know (Serbia maybe?), has committed tremendous acts of violence and oppression against their communities of Jews. This has gone on, not just 60 years ago, but for centuries. 

But my point was that it wasn't limited to Europe. Starting with the Romans in the first century and onward in every century, including ethnic cleansing by the prophet muhammed in the 7th century.

Given this history, I think Jews should demand a certain amount of understanding. So I think I'd like to communicate two things:

First, take it easy on people when they bring up the issue of antisemitism. Some people, like myself, are not using it to shut down argumentation, but rather to remind people that if the people of the world has anything in common, it's that it's good to attack Jews. I see much of the criticism against Israel as unfair and a simple repetition of age-old lies that tend to blame the victim (the victim being the Jewish state now). 

Second, if one does wish to criticize Jews or Israel for their actions in their struggle for peace, please provide a reasonable alternative that will clearly lead towards peace. Then we can argue academically over whether that proposal could work. If there is no clear alternative, then any criticism is just an attack on the Jewish state, and in that case, all you are doing is helping to destroy it. 

If helping to destroy the State of Israel is not an act of antisemitism, I don't know what is.",True,,8epb,True,0,1230861860,abhoffman,1,1,0

But I guess you know something these folks do not. I want real research on AIDS.  You want to stick with the statis quo that hasn't resolved shit in 20 some years.  You would rather a select few be able to study aids while dissenting scientist are not able to because they disagree.  What kinda of fuckin science is that?  You would rather call names and not even explore other options.  Have you ever thought mainstream academia could be wrong.  It's happened in the past.  Why is that not a possibility here?

In fact, the HIV epidemic in Africa is spread mostly through heterosexual sex-- I suggest you check out an interesting book called *The Wisdom of Whores*. Basically, you're right: HIV isn't a huge threat to a lot of Americans/Canadians/Europeans because it isn't very prevalent in heterosexual communities there. However, in South Africa, the single most dangerous event in a young man's life is to get married to a girl with a high viral load--a situation which is, unfortunately, very common and very dangerous. You're right in that it isn't honestly that risky for most straight Americans, but you're right for the wrong reasons. It's harder to transmit, sure, but it's also quite unlikely that you would run into someone (or multiple people) with a high viral load in the US within your dating circle, which is the main reason it's so uncommon.

&gt;These figures are hypothetical; exact population figures are impossible to ascertain. [source](http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570777/native_americans_of_north_america.html)

I find it hard to believe that if the population wasn't exactly known how it could be known the number that were killed. I don't argue that many thousands, if not millions, were killed over a period of several hundred years, but it still does not fall in the realm of genocide. Besides, Spain, England, Canadians, and the French all also had a hand at doing damage. I know you haven't denied this, but I'm pointing it out anyway. I would also like to point out that the natives did plenty of fighting amongst themselves as well, not that it forgives anyone else for what they've done, but let's quit pretending there's a good and bad side to all of this.

As for the biological warfare, I am also under the impression that there is no proven or accepted story of Europeans intentionally killing the natives with disease. It's a fact that many more natives died from disease than from intentional killings, but let's not confuse accidents with intent. It would have been impossible to predict, with the understanding they had of disease then, that the natives would be so susceptible to European diseases.

**Immigration**

According to official records, 367,845 Jews and 33,304 non-Jews immigrated legally between 1920 and 1945.[56] It was estimated that another 50–60,000 Jews and a small number of non-Jews immigrated illegally during this period.[57] Immigration accounts for most of the increase of Jewish population, while the non-Jewish population increase was largely natural. These figures have been supported by later studies[58], though estimates of Arab immigration have been disputed.[59]

Initially, Jewish immigration to Palestine met little opposition from the Palestinian Arabs. However, as anti-Semitism grew in Europe during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Jewish immigration (mostly from Europe) to Palestine began to increase markedly, creating much Arab resentment.

The British government placed limitations on Jewish immigration to Palestine. These quotas were controversial, particularly in the latter years of British rule, and both Arabs and Jews disliked the policy, each side for its own reasons. In response to numerous Arab attacks on Jewish communities, the Haganah, a Jewish paramilitary organization, was formed on 15 June 1920 to defend Jewish residents. Tensions led to widespread violent disturbances on several occasions, notably in 1921, 1929 (primarily violent attacks by Arabs on Jews — see 1929 Hebron massacre) and 1936–1939. Beginning in 1936, several Jewish groups such as Etzel (Irgun) and Lehi (Stern Gang) conducted their own campaigns of violence against British military and Arab targets. This prompted the British government to label them both as terrorist organizations.*

The U.S. is not going to fall like Rome did because... the economy is globalized.  If the U.S. falls (barring any extreme violent events), it will because the whole world is falling.

Ahmara: gold, like anything else, is only worth what people are willing to pay for it.  It's less attached to the U.S. than the dollar, but as stated already, if the U.S. economy went into total collapse, the rest of the world would also be in pain.

Ford is looking have a positive net profit (right now they're living off of cash-on-hand from leasing/selling assets) in 2011 (http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081202/AUTO01/812020408).  They're working on the North American Ford Verve/Fiesta as well as a new line of plug-in/hybrid vehicles (the Ford Escape is one of the largest percentage improvements in economy from a hybrid conversion).  Ford began their restructuring a while ago (versus GM and Chrysler who are just trying to now but don't have the money and can't secure the loans [without the government bailout]).  I think Ford would be a decent investment.

Look at everything in the world and try to exploit ideas that will have future demand - alternative energy companies are looking pretty good right now (the green movement is finally gaining traction in the government).

Rantisi also stated that ""the Nazis received tremendous financial aid from the Zionist banks and monopolies, and this contributed to their rise to power"", and accused the Jewish owned Berlin-based investment bank Mendelssohn &amp; Co. of funding the Nazis, calling it a ""Zionist bank"".[105]

For one, any new translations from the old texts have to be approved by the Holy Synod, or else they are invalid. Also that protestant book didn't have the sign of the Cross on it's covers, and some key phrases were modified so that they could be used against the orthodox teachings of the Holy Tradition. Why did they do that? Because Protestants are guided by the [Sola Scriptura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_scriptura), so everything in their bible MUST reflect their personal beliefs and critiques to the Orthodox Church. Not everyone should interpret the Bible, as it takes some level of spirituality to understand (You don’t take a 10 year old and try to teach him Integrals, they are steps that need to be followed.

Not that it is false,  but it's a bit reactionary and especially suspect in the ""Facts"" used to write this article since everything else is put forth faltering fact.

Please do,  post some information that one can take as fact, with quotes from actual statesmen in denmark that refer to multiple assailants.    The CCTV recording shows but one.   Mid 20s (not youth) attacking the israelis.    


I don't know what YOU'RE smoking.   But only 2 out of 50 sources I've read from GNS show any mention of multiple assailants,  and all of those seem to assume the youths were the assailants rather than the 27 yr old who had been preceded (by days)  by youths harassing the victims.   This harassment by the youths was also not restricted to just the two shot and seems to be a completely separate situation.

Also,  I am not trying to defend this guy,  I simply want to point out that its not likely some Arab influenced attack in so much as it wasn't something he planned with a group of like minded individuals,  but rather a mentally unstable arab who felt he had a cause.

Price of not learning lessons

I MUST express my shock, horror, disappointment and sadness at the situation in Gaza where hundreds of people have been killed by Israeli forces while the international community does nothing. Hundreds of people have been killed in the last few days on top of those killed each year. The media portrays people as ‘extremists’ or ‘terrorists’. Does this include the majority of victims who are babies, young children, women and the old – bombed or shot in their homes? There are innocent Israeli casualties inflicted by Palestinian retaliation, but these are disproportionate compared to the massive fatalities inflicted on the Palestinian civilian population by the Israeli government. Every life is precious. Every day, Palestinians are denied a basic right to education or die as result of check-points when they cannot reach hospitals. I have spoken to people who have visited Gaza and the ‘refugee camps’ where Palestinians are forced to live. There are many parallels to be drawn between these and the horrific concentration camps of the Second World War and the de-humanising treatment of the people. Do the suffering and horrors inflicted on European Jews before and during the war justify our silence at the treatment of Palestinians? How long must the people of Palestine suffer and pay this price for Europe’s guilt? Is the continuous humiliation and suffering caused to the Palestinians so different to that inflicted on the Jewish population across Europe before and during the war? We rightly commemorate Holocaust Memorial Day at the end of January. We say we must remember the past so these horrors are not repeated. But have we learnt its lessons or do they not apply to Israel? Can we continue, through our collective guilt, to turn a blind eye to abused becoming abuser? Everyone, every colour, race and religion, the young, old, men or women, is entitled to human rights, freedom, dignity.

The Jews had a puny kingdom that existed for a short time 3000 years ago which then got its puny ass kicked by all the regional powers. That doesn’t make it Jewish land! And there are strong doubts about the actual extent of Jewish ancestry of Ashkenazim, for example.   

&gt; Both people can exist on it. Besides, the evidence that the people who lived in Palestine for ""millenium"" is lax and contradictory. It is a fact that a lot of ""palestinians"" are foreigners just like we are.

Ok then, let me put it differently. The Pals are the descendants of all the cultures that have settled, lived and ruled over the region over the millennia eg. Phoenician, Israelite, roman, greek, arab, turk etc. That gives them a much stronger claim to the land than recent European immigrants with dubious links to the area.
 
&gt; If you do not live in a sovereign state with borders, and if you do not have a national identity, you are just sitting on a piece of land. You have no say who settles down next to you.

Actually by virtue of the fact that they have been living there for generations it is quite understandable for them to be concerned and choosy about who to settles in their neighborhood ( would you and your neighbours be perfectly fine if a crack dealer settled next door to you and opened a brothel?).  It also makes it to all intents and purposes their land. You don’t get to pretend that your own convenient criterion for land ownership is objectively valid. Most sane people intuitively realize the long history and presence of the Palestinians in the area makes it their land.  

&gt;Palestine was always occupied by different powers. It is historically unfortunate for the arabs of Palestine that they never had a sovereign state but they never even planned one until jews came, and they never had a chance for one until jewish state rose.

The Jewish state didn’t simply rise, it was imposed on the natives and most were expelled to make way for it. The Zionists created the Palestinian identity through their actions. 

&gt; Ideally every people would not have to resort to force to get what they want. Israel exists and any future plans should include that as a basic premise.

I agree with you but Israel must return to the 67 borders, demolish the settlements and accept or compensate all the Palestinian refugees. It should also compensate all the Palestinians for all the suffering it has caused them

&gt;Incorrect. They only started to protest when racists started spreading rumours and exaggerations about the zionism and jews, in order to radicalize the population.

You're incorrect not I. The Arabs were remarkably tolerant towards the incoming Jews until the Balfour declaration when their true sinister intentions became apparent.  

&gt;An injustice was done to them just after an injustice by them was done to us. 

Which one was that? 

&gt; Some of them were actually evicted. Some fought. Most ran.

Most were ethnically cleansed in a violent and planned campaign. Let’s try to be accurate here. Please go read the relevant works of Finklestein and Pappe.   

&gt; The was majority that did not now resides in Israel as legal citizens and wants no part of any ""palestinian"" aspirations. It is not being oppressed.

Those living in the occupied territories are most definitely being oppressed by any reasonable definition of the term. 

&gt;No. Post proof.

[Sure](http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/maps/1900s/1920-73israel.jpg)

&gt; The truth is that Palestine is not a small box from which you have to remove people in order to put in some other people. 

Exactly, yet that’s exactly what the Zionists intended and have done. 

&gt; It is the historic homeland of the jewish people and jewish people will fight to death anyone who denies that to them, even their own brothers. The tragedy of arab dispossession from Palestine could have been prevented if arabs didn't resort to violence,

The Zionists instigated the violence by intending to dispossess the natives of their land and creating their own country on it. They instigated the violence in their violent campaigns of ethnic cleansing. And they instigated the violence by finally illegally creating Israel.

For intracontinental travel I'd definitely recommend hitchhiking. It's easier than you'd think, safer than you'd imagine (at least if all you have to go by is Hollywood horror movies), and the people you meet are often more interesting than the places you go. Oh, and it's free, too!

Getting from the Americas to Eurasia/Africa (or even Australia, Iceland, Greenland or various other islands around the globe) can be more difficult to do for free but still very doable. There are tons of places online where you can find work on a boat in exchange for a free ride (typically as a helping hand on small privately-owned leisure vessels) and I've also heard of people having great successes simply walking around ports (you say you're in California, right? San Francisco would probably be the best bet in the USA) offering to work on fishing/cargo ships in exchange for passage. Of course, if you're not feeling that adventurous and don't mind spending a few hundred dollars, you can always take a plane. No shame at all in that, though I'd still highly recommend conventional land travel when merely traversing a continent. Planes are expensive and boring and if you abuse them you'll become more of a tourist than a traveler which has always been a big turn-off for me. 

Beyond actual travel expenses, sleeping on a budget can range from free to very cheap -- especially as a recent high school grad (lower standards!). As mentioned in another post, CouchSurfing seems to be a very cool service (I've never used it personally) and with some skillful use of public library internet access I'd imagine you'd be able to set yourself up with accommodations even while on the road. Of course there's the option of carrying a sleeping bag and tent/tarp on your pack, which is what I've done in the past but may be difficult or unfavorable if you're not the camping type (during winter months, I'd suggest being at or below ~35° latitude if you're following this method... personal experience here). Hostels in Europe and Asia may be a good idea (never tried 'em) if you're willing to pay a bit and share living space, you're also bound to meet some interesting people. The USA has no real equivalent of the hostel, at least in most cities I've been to. I'd stay away from hotels/motels because they're overpriced, boring, and homogeneous. My junior year in high school I went on a road trip with some friends from Chicago to NY to LA and then back, staying only at chain motels like Super 8, Motel 6, etc... If there's any way to suck the life out of an otherwise adventurous trip, this would have to be it.

Now, the last and foremost is food, the third and most important member of the traveling trinity (a way to get around, a place to sleep, and something to eat). If you want to save up your paychecks for two years for this trip, spend most of your hard-earned money here. Unlike getting rides and sleeping outside or couchsurfing, you're going to have a very hard time getting food for free. Assuming theft and begging are out of the question (they are for me, but I won't impose my morality on others) the only feasible method of getting food without monetary exchange that I can think of is dumpster diving. 

Ah, I can write a whole new block of text about dumpster diving alone but I'll give you the tl;dr version. Dumpster diving isn't as gross as you think it is. Most dumpsters aren't as gross as what you see in cartoons (but some are... again, personal experience) and your main goal isn't really pre-eaten food scraps but rather whole perishable food items that were tossed because they've passed their peak of freshness. We're talking stuff like day-old bread (not uncommon to find a garbage bag full of bread with nothing else, which is not gross at all), canned foods that 'expired' a week ago even when they're probably still fine for another year, etc... A 15 minute gleaning of food from a dumpster behind a bakery or small grocery store (most large megagrocery stores have impenetrable dumpsters for liability reasons and because they love tossing out tens of thousands of calories of food per day) can yield as much grade-A (okay, maybe B+) food as your pack can hold, easily several days worth. A useful skill to practice in the weeks before your trip is eating less to adjust your metabolism ahead of time. While at home I work out a lot and regularly consume 4000+ calories per day, but give me a week or two of preparation and I can easily cut that down to 2000 calories per day without any cut in physical performance or a feeling of hunger. Lowering your food consumption will make your life a lot easier, that's for sure.

If you're not willing to dumpster dive, there are other good ways to eat well on a minimal amount of money. Whatever you do, DO NOT go to restaurants too often -- you'll be dead broke within a month. In the USA, you're looking at an easy $10-15 per meal plus tip, and more if you want something better than a pre-made &amp; unthawed burger at IHOP. Fast food offers a better bang for the buck, but that's incredibly boring and you'll feel like crap after a while. Sandwich shops can be a good idea (five dollar footlongs!) in terms of both calories/dollar and nutritional value (a sandwich with a lean meat, lots of veggies, cheese, and whole wheat bread covers four out of the five food groups) but I doubt you'll want sandwiches thrice daily for a year.

Going to grocery stores and doing a little cooking for yourself is probably the best idea. Bring along a portable butane stove ($20 for a decent one and butane is super cheap) and you can buy some dried beans and rice and cook them up for less than a quarter per meal. Canned corn is also cheap and good and my very brief online investigation shows that beans, rice, and corn together provide all essential amino acids so you needn't fret over a diet low in animal protein. Eggs are another great budget food (cholesterol is insignificant when you're abstaining completely from modern junk food) and you can cook them nearly any way you'd like with your butane stove and a portable pot/pan. If you hit up a grocery store near closing time, you may be able to get that day's bakery goods at a heavily discounted price, if not for free. Same thing goes for their deli and produce section, just ask the clerk about it and take advantage of whatever deals they offer. Independently owned bakeries work well with this method, too, so be sure to check them out when you come across them. If you come across a good deal then fill up your pack (I will come back to the issue of your backpack later) with several days' worth of food. Unless your trip is very boring, you will not be able to go to a grocery store every day so preparedness is key. Most of this advice is U.S.-centric but applies to varying degrees elsewhere, as well. Eating in Western Europe is going to be more expensive, so prepare for that. If you make your way to South America, Africa, or Asia (except Japan, ahhh! Tokyo is the least friendly city on earth to a traveler on a budget) you'll be surprised at how cheap food is. The open-air market is almost nonexistent in America but a common sight in other parts of the globe, and is a very good source of cheap food.

What makes it Jewish land is jewish people's undisputed and deeply rooted cultural, religious and ethnical connection and aspirations to it, not a particular event.

&gt; That gives them a much stronger claim to the land than recent European immigrants with dubious links to the area.

No, it is a casual rationalization that is applied because it is currently convenient to do so.

&gt; Actually by virtue of the fact that they have been living there for generations it is quite understandable for them to be concerned and choosy about who to settles in their neighborhood ( would you and your neighbours be perfectly fine if a crack dealer settled next door to you and opened a brothel?). 

Concerned? Yes. Choosy? No. You do not get to choose your neighbours unless you live in a community with rules, in case of nations a sovereign state; if there are no rules, the only means of enforcement of your choice is might, which they did not have either. Freedom of movement, remember?

&gt; It also makes it to all intents and purposes their land. You don’t get to pretend that your own convenient criterion for land ownership is objectively valid. 

In absence of formal declaration, the only way to determine ownership is force of violence. This is the exact thing arabs tried to use and they failed at it.

&gt; The Jewish state didn’t simply rise, it was imposed on the natives and most were expelled to make way for it.

After they resisted its creation by violence, yes, though ""expelled"" is not an accurate description. From historical perspective, this isn't different from any other recently formed nations.

&gt; I agree with you but Israel must return to the 67 borders, demolish the settlements and accept or compensate all the Palestinian refugees. It should also compensate all the Palestinians for all the suffering it has caused them

I agree almost completely. I also believe Israeli businessmen would be smart to invest in the new Palestine as soon as things stabilize. However, there will be no return to 1967 unless Israel is convinced that there will be no more attacks. Otherwise, Israel will keep intimidating arabs until they renounce the violence as a primary tool of negotiation.

Whether these attacks are morally justified or not is immaterial for us. We had too much violence against us to care. Justice will be talked about at the negotiation table, and there will be no negotiation under terrorist fire. Hamas and PLO know this very well and used this to abort the Oslo accords, because their genuine goal is to prolong the conflict. We see this as aggression and an attempt to create war, and we react accordingly.

&gt; You're incorrect not I. The Arabs were remarkably tolerant towards the incoming Jews until the Balfour declaration when their true sinister intentions became apparent.

Their ""true sinister intentions"" did not include either murder or transfer of arabs. They did include a creation of jewish national home in Palestine, which I hold to be an irrevocable right of the jewish people that needs no justification.

&gt; Which one was that?

The arab riots which British refused to subdue, and which had every sign of the same attitude jews received in Europe and Russia; and subsequent invasion of 1948 which was intended to slay all jews in Palestine.

&gt; [Sure](http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/maps/1900s/1920-73israel.jpg)

This map, as all modern maps, falsely assumes that anything that is not occupied by jews belongs to arabs. By 1940, JNF has legally acquired 6% of useful land. The rest was taken when arabs fled during 1948 invasion, siding with the invaders, which invalidated any rights we would've respected. What you see on the first map is these 6%. Now, how do you explain 25% of arabic population in Israel?

&gt; Exactly, yet that’s exactly what the Zionists intended and have done.

Nonsense. It is absurd to think that jews would want to do something that was done to them for nineteen centuries. Select quotes from zionist extremists to support that notion are a bane of the uninformed. Radical transferism was only gaining traction after the very events you failed to name, and it was not in the end the cause for arab flight from Palestine - though it was, I admit, the cause for the rumours and panic.

&gt; The Zionists instigated the violence by intending to dispossess the natives of their land and creating their own country on it.

That is rationalization of violence. When violence becomes employed, reasons behind it cease to matter. We had every right to create a country, and arabs had the choice of accepting it or fighting it and facing the consequences of failing in such a fight. It is a fact that violence was unleashed by arabs.

&gt; Most were ethnically cleansed in a violent and planned campaign. Let’s try to be accurate here. Please go read the relevant works of Finklestein and Pappe.

Pappe's and Finkelstein's theories are only in part correct - there *was* ethnic cleansing but nowhere near the scale both claim; additionally, Pappe himself admitted that he was only interested in the ideological perspective of his works and not its factual accuracy; better yet, other historians have heavily criticized him for outright fabrications he relied on to create a picture of total and intentional dispossession of arabs.

I admit that I have not read either in depth. I intend to do so, my reading list is long.

&gt; and could have been repaired if western superpower wars didn't intervene.

PLO and the technique of violent resistance was created by KGB, through use of its presence in Egypt. Arafat was trained by KGB in the same type of ideological warfare KGB used to cause wars in other countries. The greatest ""palestinian"" leader of all times was not, ironically, a ""palestinian"" himself, and all of his work was always consistent with a single goal: *prevention* of meaningful dialogue and creation of arab state in Palestine unless such state could be used to consume Israel.

&gt; Your theory is utterly wrong again! But keep trying.

I still want you to say out loud that it is the arabs who made the choice to respond with violence.

No, none of that makes it Jewish land any more than Palestinian land since  they also have intense religious, cultural and ethnic connections to the area. Cultural aspiration means nothing. I am not entitled to your house and car if I aspire for it really hard. It is also tenuous in light of the fact that many Jews are clearly foreign to the region, are recent immigrants and possess dubious ancestry. So we are left with the fact that Jews aspire for the land really hard.  That simply isn’t good enough justification for Jews to evict the natives who have unbroken roots and a presence going back at least a millennium and taking their place.   

&gt; No, it is a casual rationalization that is applied because it is currently convenient to do so.

There is nothing casual about it. It is only casually dismissed by Zionists like you because it is inconvenient.

&gt; Concerned? Yes. Choosy? No. You do not get to choose your neighbours unless you live in a community with rules, in case of nations a sovereign state

Nonsense. The idea that the Palestinians lived in communities and societies without a set of rules is not only ridiculous but patently racist. Your ignorance or unwillingness to acknowledge them doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. I think you should go and consult some basic anthropological primers. 

&gt; if there are no rules, the only means of enforcement of your choice is might, which they did not have either. Freedom of movement, remember?

Since your above arguments about Pals lacking rules is blatantly ridiculous your argument  comes down to might makes right… which is a total non sequitir and not fit to be invoked in a rational discussion. 

&gt; In absence of formal declaration,

And what exactly is a formal declaration? Is your understanding of the term “formal declaration” culturally independent?  The Pals claimed it to be their land, why is that not good enough? After all they have a presence in the region going back at least a millennium if not longer.

&gt; he only way to determine ownership is force of violence.

So the Zionists overpowered the natives so they deserve the land? Fuck off. 

&gt; This is the exact thing arabs tried to use and they failed at it.

And they were fully justified in doing so since outsiders were hell-bent on slapping a country for themselves on their ancestral lands without their consent and happy to use violence to achieve their despicable aims. Your argument is again based on a reprehensible notion of might makes right, which is not only a non-sequitur but rejected by all civilized peoples as an immoral doctrine to live by.    

&gt; After they resisted its creation by violence,

The creation of Israel was illegal and without the consent of the native majority and achieved through the use of terror and violence against the natives, so they damn well had the right to respond through violence

&gt; , yes, though ""expelled"" is not an accurate description.

No , it is an a very accurate description

&gt; From historical perspective, this isn't different from any other recently formed nations.

That is very debatable and you have not presented any evidence to indicate this is so. But even if it had a figment of truth to it it is a glib appeal to tradition or common practice hence logically fallacious and a crap moral justification.  

&gt; However, there will be no return to 1967 unless Israel is convinced that there will be no more attacks.

Since the land doesn’t belong to them they should return to 67 borders without any stipulations. This would be wise since the occupation itself is a primary cause of Palestinian anger and violence

&gt; Otherwise, Israel will keep intimidating arabs until they renounce the violence as a primary tool of negotiation. 

Israel will keep intimidating the arabs to stop them being angry and violent about the brutal Israeli ethnic cleansing, oppression and occupation they have been experiencing? That makes a whole lot of sense.

&gt; Whether these attacks are morally justified or not is immaterial for us. We had too much violence against us to care.

I understand that Zionists give scant care for moral issues. It would explain how they commit atrocities against the Pals and continue to defend and justify it.  

&gt; Justice will be talked about at the negotiation table, and there will be no negotiation under terrorist fire.

Who says that? Many nations including my own (UK) have successfully engaged in negotiation while under terrorist fire with terrorists. 

&gt; Hamas and PLO know this very well and used this to abort the Oslo accords, because their genuine goal is to prolong the conflict. 

Blame the Israeli electorate for electing the murderous war criminal Sharon. The Pals were quite content with carrying on the negotiations.

&gt; We see this as aggression and an attempt to create war, and we react accordingly.

Electing a murderous war criminal who had recently desecrated holy ground was a direct affront and signifies that the Israelis were not willing for a real peace. Israel is responsible for the breakdown of peace talks and the second intifada.

&gt; Their ""true sinister intentions"" did not include either murder or transfer of arabs.

That is very debatable.

&gt; They did include a creation of jewish national home in Palestine, which I hold to be an irrevocable right of the jewish people that needs no justification.

It doesn’t matter what you hold.  The natives, the majority of the population, did not agree to the idea.  They rejected it. An impartial observer would see this erases any justification for Israel’s creation.

&gt; The arab riots which British refused to subdue, and which had every sign of the same attitude jews received in Europe and Russia;

Nonsense. The Jews in Europe or Russia weren’t trying to institute a pure Jewish nation there.   

&gt; and subsequent invasion of 1948 which was intended to slay all jews in Palestine.

The invasion in 1948 was in response to the huge refugee crisis caused by the Zionist ethnic cleansing which was already under way in Palestine. The creation of Israel also had no legal basis in international law and an act of flagrant aggression against the surrounding nations. 

&gt; This map, as all modern maps, falsely assumes that anything that is not occupied by jews belongs to arabs. By 1940, JNF has legally acquired 6% of useful land.

It doesn’t matter, it demonstrates conclusively that most of the land that Israel now sits on did not belong to the Jews. 

&gt; The rest was taken when arabs fled during 1948 invasion, siding with the invaders, which invalidated any rights we would've respected.

What are you babbling about? Most of them were forcefully evicted in a deliberate campaign of ethnic cleansing.

&gt; Nonsense. It is absurd to think that jews would want to do something that was done to them for nineteen centuries.

That is the nature of Zionism like all forms of racism. History records that that is exactly what happened. Your incredulity cannot stand as an argument. 

&gt; That is rationalization of violence. When violence becomes employed, reasons behind it cease to matter. 

What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Stop talking in riddles.

&gt; We had every right to create a country, 

That is what you keep repeating but there does not seem to be any persuasive reason to think so. On the other hand there are very many good reasons for thinking the exact opposite.

&gt; and arabs had the choice of accepting it or fighting it and facing the consequences of failing in such a fight.

Nonsense, the forceful and unconsensual imposition of a Jewish state by European immigrant on the Arabs was unjustifiable regardless of whether the Pals picked up arms to defend their rights or not. Rape and theft is wrong whether the victim chooses to defend him/herself physically or not.

&gt; It is a fact that violence was unleashed by arabs.

No, it isn’t. Sorry to disappoint you.

&gt; I admit that I have not read either in depth. I intend to do so, my reading list is long.

Well, then their arguments and conclusions stand until you do read them in more depth. 

&gt; PLO and the technique of violent resistance was created by KGB, through use of its presence in Egypt. Arafat was trained by KGB in the same type of ideological warfare KGB used to cause wars in other countries. The greatest ""palestinian"" leader of all times was not, ironically, a ""palestinian"" himself, and all of his work was always consistent with a single goal: prevention of meaningful dialogue and creation of arab state in Palestine unless such state could be used to consume Israel.

I have no time for kooky conspiracy theories. 

&gt; I still want you to say out loud that it is the arabs who made the choice to respond with violence.

You can sing it from the mountain tops but it doesn’t make it true.

I frequent a site that is dedicated to American football and rugby, the vast majority of the members are from Europe and are footballers (rugby and american). We have this discussion several times a year and the majority of the people agree that American football is the rougher sport.

The big difference is the tackling. In rugby you actually tackle the player. You grab them below the shoulders but above the knees and you wrap your arms around and drag them to the ground. In American football you HIT the player anywhere on the body and throw them to the ground. 

American football is a game of yardage. You want to lay a hit on the player and put them on the ground hard because every yard counts. Because you have the pads their entire body is open to be tackled.

Rugby, by comparison is a game of possessions. You just need to drag the player to the ground. The lack of pads means there are much more rules for tackling. You can't hit the player because if you fail to wrap up the person you are tackling it isn't a valid tackle. You can't tackle above the armpits and you also can't tackle at the knees.

If you watch the games you will see it. In American football the tacklers will ""tee off"" on the ball carrier. They basically dive into the player to deliver a hard hit and stop them in their tracks.

I have played rugby, it is a very rough sport. It just isn't rough the way American football is. Both games require an incredible amount of toughness and incredibly large balls to play them competitively, though.",True,,91z5,True,0,1230945113,Stooby,6,6,0

Before the introduction of the Arabic notation, multiplication was difficult, and division even of integers called into play the highest mathematical faculties. Probably nothing in the modern world would have more astonished a Greek mathematician than to learn that a large proportion of the population of Western Europe could perform the operation of division for the largest numbers. This fact would have seemed to him a sheer impossibility. Our modern power of easy reckoning with decimal fractions is the almost miraculous result of the gradual discovery of a perfect notation.""

&gt; I understand that Zionists give scant care for moral issues. It would explain how they commit atrocities against the Pals and continue to defend and justify it.

The people who claim to represent the ""Pals"" have indicated through words and acts that their final goal is not a settlement with jews but full recapture of Israel. They may denounce the legitimacy of Israel under international law, but that does nothing to actually alter that legitimacy. If they don't want to play by everyone's rules, we'll play by their rules: eye for an eye, until such time that terrorism stops. The ""atrocities"" are miniscule compared to virtually any major conflict, and opponents of zionism can never explain why they are so attached to this particular instance of mutual injustice and want to govern it by the rules they have never applied to anyone else. Of course, most of them are very bad at acting and turn out to be banal low intelligence supremacists who can not reconcile their own misery without having a specific object of blame.

&gt; Who says that? Many nations including my own (UK) have successfully engaged in negotiation while under terrorist fire with terrorists.

I didn't know IRA had as its stated goal installation of Irish religious regime over the whole of UK, and that it was enabled and directed by a foreign nation whose goal is to establish Irish religious regime over the entire world, and that it had underneath it vast body of religious nonsense that justified slaughter of all infidels in the name of Irish god.

&gt; Blame the Israeli electorate for electing the murderous war criminal Sharon.

Sharon was elected because Israeli needed a leader with violent reputation to retaliate against terrorism. This is the exact same thing that happened with Hamas. Irony much?

&gt; The Pals were quite content with carrying on the negotiations.

Which ones? Rabin's? Ho-ho-ho. Arafat deliberately inserted suicide bombings before every round of negotiations to prevent the implementation of Oslo accords. You don't cut the branch you're sitting on.

&gt; Electing a murderous war criminal who had recently desecrated holy ground was a direct affront and signifies that the Israelis were not willing for a real peace. Israel is responsible for the breakdown of peace talks and the second intifada.

I won't bother explaining you how ""desecrated holy ground"" is one of the recent inventions designed to keep the conflict alive. Suffice is to say, no one will be willing to concede anything when facing crazy fanatics with suicide vests.

&gt; That is very debatable.

As long as it's ""debatable"", don't state it as a fact.

&gt; The natives, the majority of the population, did not agree to the idea. They rejected it. An impartial observer would see this erases any justification for Israel’s creation.

No, what they in fact did was sell what land they got from the British to jews, and then demand it back with guns. Well, to be fair, the people who got the land were absentee landlords and the people with guns were the arabs, but if you want to go by modern conventions as you indicated above, that's a ripoff, and it was only enabled by British double promises.

&gt; Nonsense. The Jews in Europe or Russia weren’t trying to institute a pure Jewish nation there.

That's because Palestine is the appropriate place for a pure Jewish nation (and ironically, no one is ""pure""). Besides, in Russia a ""pure Jewish"" nation was created for them, by mass expulsion out of the sight of purer russians.

&gt; The invasion in 1948 was in response to the huge refugee crisis caused by the Zionist ethnic cleansing which was already under way in Palestine. 
 
It was not huge and it was not already underway. It was still a civil war which was against initiated by arabs as a continuation of previous violent conflict that was as well initiated by arabs, and from which people were fleeing. Arab countries didn't want any of the ""palestinians"" and turned them away. Their objective of war was joint slaughter of jews, so that Palestine could be sliced up for everyone's benefit. 

&gt; The creation of Israel also had no legal basis in international law and an act of flagrant aggression against the surrounding nations.

Wrong. Law of Belligerent Occupation (Hague Conventions 1907); also: 

""Article 95 of that Treaty [between Allies and turks] drew an essential distinction between the status of Mesopotamia and Syria and the status of Palestine. The first two countries were provisionally recognised as independent States, whereas, in regard to Palestine, no mention was made of independence nor was there any reference to the assistance and advice of a Mandatory. The article referred only to the administration of the country by a Mandatory chosen by the Principal Allied and Associated Powers, without making any reservation in regard to the character of the administration"" - minutae of Permanent Mandates Commission, June 1930.

This in turn is authorized by Charter of League of Nations, chapter 22.

British were free to do what they saw fit and what they saw fit was national jewish homeland. No amount of moralization can undo that.

It was also not an act of aggression against the surrounding nations, who, being surrounding nations, had no standing to claim casus belli; unless, of course, you do not wish to distinguish between ""palestinian"" arabs and the rest of arab nations, in which case ""palestinian"" national identity is completely invalidated with prejudice, again leaving us with a conflict of mights at which jews prevailed. Their war was a war of aggression with the purpose of annihilating the jews.

""It doesn’t matter, it demonstrates conclusively that most of the land that Israel now sits on did not belong to the Jews.""

No, it demonstrates conclusively that land on which the jews resided before 1948 was legally obtained from Mandate powers, church donations or purchase from arabs.

&gt; What are you babbling about? Most of them were forcefully evicted in a deliberate campaign of ethnic cleansing.

And your proof of that is of course Ilan Pappe, who admitted that he composed his entire theory to fit a premeditated agenda?

&gt; History records that that is exactly what happened. Your incredulity cannot stand as an argument.

Which history would that be, then?

&gt; &gt; That is rationalization of violence. When violence becomes employed, reasons behind it cease to matter.
&gt; What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Stop talking in riddles.

It is supposed to mean that, when you initiate aggression, you bear the consequences. In cases of war, you bear it with your own life.

&gt; That is what you keep repeating but there does not seem to be any persuasive reason to think so

The British had legal standing to turn over the country to the jews. Jews legally purchased lands from arabs beyond those received from the British. Jews also have a deep intrinsic connection to the land that drove them there in the first place. Which part of this is not persuasive to you?

&gt; Nonsense, the forceful and unconsensual imposition of a Jewish state by European immigrant on the Arabs was unjustifiable regardless of whether the Pals picked up arms to defend their rights or not.

It was certainly justifiable by international law, and also by persecution of expulsion of jews in arab countries, in Europe and Russia, and especially so by Palestine civil war and 1948.

&gt; No, it isn’t. Sorry to disappoint you.

Yes, it is. There was no serial violence between jews and arabs in Palestine before the Husseini riots, and Husseini riots were slaughter of jews by arabs.

&gt; Well, then their arguments and conclusions stand until you do read them in more depth.

No. If you want to use them as a base for discussion, you will have to either wait until I read them, or show me how they are composed and what are their major conclusions so that I can refute them.

&gt; I have no time for kooky conspiracy theories.

It is not a kooky conspiracy theory. Go to the WSJ site and search for Ian Pacepa. Russians decided to enter the Middle East in the fifties to counter the perceived american threat. Cairo-born Arafat was shipped to Moscow from Egypt, where he was born (so much for ""palestinian"" nationalism) where he studied and was recruited by KGB, by confession of then chief of Romanian intelligence service who was on KGB's payroll. Russians had strong presence of ""military advisors"" in Egypt, and they are the ones who enabled Egypt to attack Israel militarily in the first place. In seventies, Israel has conducted special operations to steal and analyze classified military equipment from Egypt that was made by russians. When he returned to middle east, he became a ""palestinian"" nationalist, and founded PLO with KGB's funding. This is also the exact point at which the idea that ""palestinians"" are descendants of biblic philistines emerged, as a rationalization to reinvigorate the struggle of arabs against Israel.

&gt; You can sing it from the mountain tops but it doesn’t make it true.

Then I will for the fifth time ask you to name me the exact point at which the relation between arabs in Palestine and jewish immigrants became violent.

Obviously 'reasonable' here highly dependent on the citizen's circumstances and the acts engaged in by the state.

I can understand that as an individual moving against the status quo, it may not feel like any positive outcome is likely. However, no action will definitely fail to improve the situation. Reasonable actions would be to consistently write to your 'representatives' to show that you actually care about the things that they do in your name, and argue your position with others to get them involved as well. This is why people here (on both sides) are arguing their positions.

The involvement in policy discussion by citizens is essential for a functioning democracy; it seems that all our Western governments are more elected dictatorships than true democracies - since participation by the people (except at election time) is not appreciated. I'll add that while I don't have much time for the US, I have a great deal of respect for the stated philosophical positions of some of the people involved in establishing the US - particularly Paine and Jefferson (and later Thoreau) who held a similar position to the one I have stated above - these all argued for various levels of civil disobedience (if you disagree with policies, don't break the law, but make the state's life as difficult as possible).

I understand the difficulties that a single person would face (particularly in the US where the electoral system seems - and probably was - designed to prevent actual democracy of the masses) in standing against wrongs by the state. But to not act leaves a person tainted  - just think about how people asked how it was possible for good people in various dictatorships to allow them to continue (Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, East Germany, most of Eastern Europe etc.).

Edit response to late additions:
I agree that you weren't involved in setting up the system, but other nations (New Zealand for example) have found that they are able to address issues of disenfranchisement by revising the electoral system, something that has resulted in a much greater level of citizen involvement.

At first the Ancient Roman government was very oppressive and restrictive. It was a republic, but mostly just by name. Because Roman law was built on by Romes ancient prehistory culture, which said that the man of the house literally owned everything. Meaning that any man of a household could sell his family as wives to other men, as sex slaves, work slaves or even kill his own family if he were merely bored with them. The republic was mainly for show at first, as everything was secretly controlled by the corrupt senate which oppressed the people.

But as time went on, the people became more and more cultured and empathetic. The control a man had over his family was abolished, the killing of anyone for no good reason was murder and servant slaves were legally considered a family member of their owner, and slaves had full Roman citizen rights (despite still being slaves). Roman law evolved to protect the people more and more over time until corruption and oppression wasn't even tolerated anymore. Sure the system was very bad, and the atrocities at the coliseum alone were terrible, but on the whole ancient Roman government really was by Roman people for Roman people and the Roman people and culture really did flourish because of it. In fact Rome was on course for a golden age of fast cultural and scientific advancement. At least it was until the nation ultimately fell apart for economic reasons.

The only reason the Roman empire ended was because of drastic weather changes over the centuries which caused havoc on agriculture. So food was scarce and too expensive for everyone to buy, so many moved away. The economy then weakened and the Roman armies could not be maintained (unlike barbarian armies, roman soldiers had to be paid, constantly trained and provided with armor and weapons of uniform quality, all of which was very expensive. But with suddenly not enough money for the massive armies they used to have, and the ineffectiveness of the every shrinking in number legion units vs the very agile horseback archers of unseen before skill was too much for the Roman army to bear. The ancient Romans were quickly crushed by the many nearby barbarian armies from Germanic and Asian countries.

But the effect of the ancient Romans survives today. All modern law has origins in ancient Roman law, especially throughout Europe, and the constant modern evolution of this age established laws means that we should be hopefully over time fine tuning our laws into fair ones that protect the people (of course some countries find ways to abuse modern law to abuse citizens and take away their rights, but that's not the laws fault, it's a sign of a corrupt system that is using the law (laws don't oppress people, people who make and can change laws oppress people).",True,,95iy,True,0,1230957314,[deleted],0,0,0

which is it? do they or do they not love eachother?


&gt; The word atheism is one of those toys, and you play their game by using it.

Theism doesn't own words, especially one who is defined as belief in it.
How is me saying to a theist that I'm a atheist different from them telling me they believe in (a) god? 
The latter might very well be considered a ""nice"" or ""good"" thing to do, whereas atheistic statements for some demented reason is often considered ""evil"" or hurtful.

As you referred to earlier, Sam Harris advocates not using the term atheism, and while he might have arguments up his sleeve that might sway me, that article certainly didn't. 
As much as I like the author, he defeats his own purpose by turning pulling an ""atheistic viewpoint"" out of thin air in scientific argument, reminding me of the following quote by Bill Bailey:

&gt;“I don’t know anything about Afghanistan, but I know it’s full of terrorists, speaking as a mother.” So what is this ""speaking as a mother"" then? Is that a euphemism for ""talking out of my arse""? ""Suspending rational thought for a moment""? As a rational human being, Al-Qaeda are a loose association of psychopathic zealots who could be rounded up with a sustained police investigation. But speaking as a parent, they’re all eight foot tall, they’ve got lasers under their moustaches, a huge eye in their foreheads and the only way to kill them is to NUKE every country that hasn’t sent us a Christmas card in the the last 20 years!! Speaking as a mother.

Lovely isn't it?

&gt; tl;dr: You're an idiot who is more concerned with grand battles against indomitable foes than with actually advancing a cause you claim to support.

If I can't believe that humanity could eventually be free of theocracy and other global evils, what fights are worth fighting?
Thanks for showing me love by the way. are you sure you're not a christian?

The book referred to above (which I own) is a fascinating collection of essays on history, liberty, and economics.

Hoppe does make the convincing argument that as far as governments go, a limited monarchy in which the king or queen has only the royal estate to spend for government finances and war and must keep the nation in good condition to pass down to his or her heirs tends to protect personal liberties much better than democracy. He makes this observation while comparing the monarchies of Europe pre-WW1 to its democracies post-WW1.

Aristotle also lived in a unique time and civilization where numerous variations of both monarchy and democracy were in practice, depending on the city-state. I believe he also noted that 20,000 people was about the ideal population for a country.

The GDP is measured by consumption and increases when people take out consumer loans.

You are saying that since Americans eats the most, they are the wealthiest, they are the most important. It's not true. The numbers are lying to you because you haven't dug deep enough to figure out what the numbers really mean.

Macroeconomic statistics like GDP are very very easy to misinterpret. These misinterpretations are the foundation of economic ignorance in the first world. America has the identical problem to Europe, Canada and Australia. 

I may be patronizing and offensive and for that I am sorry, I don't want to make enemies. However, ignorant is ignorant. I think you are a valuable person and I think your misunderstanding is extremely common, and common to all people who get their information from the mainstream media and even popular books on economics. The problem is just that they are the wrong books.

You gotta start at the very bottom if you want to intellectually understand what is really going on. It is hard to do it intellectually, much easier to do it logically using a simple argument like I made about the desert island. If you don't understand macroeconomic theory and the various schools to their core, you are just going to confuse yourself.

Sound macroeconomics has it's basis in fungible microeconomics. People seeking to understand economics logically need to understand that it is the relationships that matter and not the content.

Ala. Doctor Reactivated for Iraq War at 68

Posted on: Monday, 19 July 2004, 06:00 CDT

DECATUR, Ala. - At 68, many people are slowing down. Not John Wicks: He's going to Iraq. Wicks, a psychiatrist, has been called out of military retirement by the Army to fill a shortage of mental health experts needed to help soldiers cope with combat. He could be gone as long as a year.

The Army hasn't told Wicks what his exact assignment in Iraq is, or where in the country it will send him.

""I believe that the morale in general is not that good since the scandal at that prison,"" he said, referring to the allegations of abuse at Abu Ghraib prison. ""When morale is high, you have fewer of these kinds of problems. And when morale is low you have more.""

Wicks, who is beginning a week of training in Texas, will have the rank of colonel. His previous military experience includes two years active duty with the Marines and 18 years in the Alabama National Guard.

Wicks is a veteran of the U.S. war with Iraq in 1991, but his wife said things are different this time.

""In Desert Storm, he was in the 109th Evacuation Hospital and they had drilled together for years,"" said Jan Wicks. ""He felt good about going with this team that he knew. He doesn't have that support this time.""

Wicks figures he will be among the oldest U.S. soldiers in the Iraq war. Martha Rudd, a spokeswoman for the Army at the Pentagon, said she has no way of knowing if Wicks would be the oldest. She said she had heard of one other doctor who was 68 and went to Iraq.

Wicks' latest assignment started with a postcard the Army sent last fall that explained the need for specialists and asked if he felt he was fit to serve.

""I stuck the thing in my pocket and carried it around for several weeks agonizing on how I should respond,"" he told The Decatur Daily in a story Sunday. ""The truth is I consider myself fit to serve, so that's how I marked it and sent it back.""

""My wife said 'You'll never hear from them.' Well, it was no time at all till I heard from them,"" Wicks said.

Wicks said recruiters initially hinted he could go to Europe or a stateside base to relieve a younger psychiatrist who would go to Iraq. The Army even gave him three choices should that scenario play out, and Dr. Wicks chose Italy, Germany and England.

""Well, I now wonder if this was just to get me hooked. Because there's no way I'm going to Italy or any of these places,"" he said. ""I'm going to Iraq."" ",False,,99jx,True,0,1230974697,jordanlund,6,6,0

Sort of a twisted way to see responsibility don't you think?

America has a most twisted psyche when it comes to violence and sex. Violence is ok while sex is forbidden.

High infant mortality rate, high teenage pregnancy and high gun crimes don't make a culture a good one. Have a gander over to Europe. The only country which is almost as fucked up and twisted is England which has some of its own issues to deal with (teen pregnancy).

And dude: get off your fucking high horse for your own sake. 16 or 14 is pretty normal of a time to lose your virginity and well...also have a lot of partners. You may not like that (I don't) but you will have to live with it.

All cultures have it, all people have it, and this is where science comes from.

Now of course, there is a cultural explanation for the fact that science was born in the India/Orient/Europe cultural continuum. The explanation is that these people had numbers on their side: they were a very large pool of humans with relatively easy methods of communication. This enabled them to spread information about how to avoid cultural and cognitive biases, as well as how to properly isolate factors from each other. They were lucky to have the means to do this, but the goal, as opposed to the means, was everybody's.

Point 1.) Financially stable US states, at some point, will be called upon by the Federal Government to support the faltering less stable states in some way.

Point 2.) The individuals that run these states currently (and always will) have their own personal interests and assets invested into the success of their own state.

Point 3.) These states (not all) will refuse these Federal government decisions.

Point 4.) Depending on the severity of the Federal govenment's sanctions against these states (overly severe knowing the US) for refusing, the states will seek support from outside the US (for municipal financing and the like).

Point 5.) As the Federal sanctions become more severe these states will eventually become unofficialy  dependant on foreign entities [governmental and commercial] (and will actually be recieving better deals). These states will no longer need the Federal government for any tangible reason.

Point 6.) These states will enforce their own borders to keep out refugees (residents) from other states becuase of a lack of resources to go around. These states will eventually quit paying dues and taxes--due to no longer recieveing help from the federal govenment and an inability to pay. 

Ponit 7.) The Federal government (effectively bankrupt) will be unofficailly left with nothing but unstable states and so it will do drastic rethinking and reorganizing.

Point 8.) Reality sets in, and the federal government is left with no choice but to redraw borders.

New York seeks help from Europe.
Alaska is (financially) taken over by Russia.
Texas seeks tangible help from Mexico.
Illinois/Wisconsin/Michigan seek help from Canada.

I actually find it somewhat plausible. 

But I have a little more distance. Whenever I see war or violence, what I see is two or more nationalistic cultures oppressing _their own_ people into violence.

Although I tend to think that the Israeli's have the upper hand in the last 20 years, their play is understandable (not excusable!) given the history. 

It's funny how the americans always get blamed for helping Israel, instead of Europeans (i'm dutch) for creating this monster. If Israel is frankenstein, we are its Dr. Frankenstein.

The underlining issue however, is no different from what started the first world war, which lead to the second, which led to Israel.  It's the idea of nation-state. One nation - one state - one shared identity.

It doesn't mix with morale of individual actions. The grey area between the cultural identity and responsibility and the individual identity and responsibility contains the logic of killing innocent people for being part of the larger cultural identity.

But currently, I don't see the nation-state idea going away; although over time; i'm sure globalisation will destroy it. (at it's own price off course).

What you as a person as a can do, is get rid of any flag any national symbol and tell yourself you are your own person. If you don't want to be responsible for ANY action your country does in your name. Stop being part of that country. I'm saying break the rules. I'm say _forget_ them. 

In my opinion, very few israelites or palestines can be considered innocent. Although I think they can all be forgiven for what they have let themselves and their families become. It hasn't been easy for anybody over there. I'm not sure I would have the strength to be bigger.

My initial reaction was to the video was 'what the fuck did israel do?' ... but then I remembered. They didn't have a poll in Israel about this attack. I'm not even sure 'the people' have all the facts. I'm not even sure the governments do. And some will hate, yes. Should we blame them? I think so. But it won't change anything. Hate is like the economy, more pointing figures leads to more pointings fingers. One bomb is like a big moral investement into hate. And that will trickle down and spread around.

It's actually pretty complicated, so I'll just let Wikipedia explain:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_It%27s_Made

&gt;Hosts:

&gt;* Lynne Adams - Season 6 - (2006 - present)

&gt;* June Wallack - Season 5 (2005)

&gt;* Lynn Herzeg - Seasons 2 - 4 (2002 - 2004)

&gt;* Mark Tewksbury - Season 1 (2001)



These would be all for the Canadian version of the show. Two versions are made, in French (for airing in Quebec and the Maritime Provinces) and in English (for the rest of Canada).



In the US, it's redubbed once again:
&gt;Additionally, a different voice-over track is recorded for U.S. audiences by Brooks T. Moore (Seasons 1-8, 2001-2007, 2008-present) or Zac Fine (2007-2008). The main difference in the versions is that the U.S. host gives units of measurement in United States customary units instead of metric units. At one point in the U.S. run, a subtitled conversion was shown on-screen over the original narration instead.



&gt;In September 2007, the 9th season began airing on Science Channel, along with new openings, graphics, and soundtracks. In addition, Zac Fine replaced Moore as the narrator. However, the eleventh season, which started airing in September 2008, reinstated Moore as the narrator and reverted to a previous title sequence and soundtrack.



And again in the UK:

&gt;In the UK, rest of Europe and S.E. Asia, the series is narrated by Tony Hirst. All episodes have been shown in the UK on the UK Discovery Channel.

Hamas was shooting the vast majority of rockets - as many as 60-70 rockets a day - in the period leading to the current operation.

Most terror organizations support their sympathetic population in some way. That's usually the reason why they're sympathetic. Al-Qaeda operated schools and social services in certain areas of Afghanistan. So does Hezbullah in southern Lebanon, etc.

Moreover, to complicate matters: many Palestinians support Hamas not only because of the schools etc., but because of its radical, uncompromising agenda of killing all Jews in Israel.

Hamas has been starved for funds for a very long time. But the population supports it. Why?  Because Hamas's enemies - the US, Israel, a few moderate European democracies - are also perceived as the enemies of the Palestinians.

Hamas is a large organization, with vast support networks throughout the world. It's disheartening to see it become the pet cause of so many Islamic organizations, some of which are ostensibly moderate. But that's exactly what's happening.

&gt;On November 23, 1937, Saudi Arabia's King Ibn Saud told British Colonel H.R.P. Dickson: ""Our hatred for the Jews dates from God's condemnation of them for their persecution and rejection of Isa (Jesus) and their subsequent rejection of His chosen Prophet."" He added ""that for a Muslim to kill a Jew, or for him to be killed by a Jew ensures him an immediate entry into Heaven and into the august presence of God Almighty.""

Also, when Hitler introduced the Nuremberg racial laws in 1935, he received telegrams of congratulation from quite a few representatives of the Arab world. One of his most ardent supporters during the war was the Mufti of Jerusalem.

The situation of Jews in Arab lands reached a low point in the 19th century. Jews in most of North Africa (including Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Morocco) were forced to live in ghettos. In Morocco, which contained the largest Jewish community in the Islamic Diaspora, Jews were made to walk barefoot or wear shoes of straw when outside the ghetto. Even Muslim children participated in the degradation of Jews, by throwing stones at them or harassing them in other ways. The frequency of anti-Jewish violence increased, and many Jews were executed on charges of apostasy. Ritual murder accusations against the Jews became commonplace in the Ottoman Empire.

&gt;By the twentieth century, the status of the dhimmi in Muslim lands had not significantly improved. H.E.W. Young, British Vice Consul in Mosul, wrote in 1909:

&gt;The attitude of the Muslims toward the Christians and the Jews is that of a master towards slaves, whom he treats with a certain lordly tolerance so long as they keep their place. Any sign of pretension to equality is promptly repressed.

&gt;The danger for Jews became even greater as a showdown approached in the UN over partition in 1947. The Syrian delegate, Faris el-Khouri, warned: ""Unless the Palestine problem is settled, we shall have difficulty in protecting and safeguarding the Jews in the Arab world.""

&gt;More than a thousand Jews were killed in anti-Jewish rioting during the 1940's in Iraq, Libya, Egypt, Syria and Yemen. This helped trigger the mass exodus of Jews from Arab countries.

Even back in 1968 Syrian schoolchildren are taught to hate Jews. The Syrian Minister of Education wrote in 1968: ""The hatred which we indoctrinate into the minds of our children from their birth is sacred.""

After the Six-Day War in 1967, the Israelis found public school textbooks that had been used to educate Arab children in the West Bank. Some portrayals of Jews:

&gt;""The Jews are scattered to the ends of the earth, where they live exiled and despised, since by their nature they are vile, greedy and enemies of mankind...""


&gt;""We shall expel all the Jews from the Arab countries.""


&gt;""The Jews of our time are the descendants of the Jews who harmed the Prophet Muhammad. They betrayed him, they broke the treaty with him and joined sides with his enemies to fight him...""

Sadly as we are all aware the accusations levied at Iraq at the time that it was in material breach of that resolution (specifically with regard to WMD) and indeed the failure of the US and UK to gain agreement that Iraq was indeed in breach (the security council was divided...) would suggest that enforcement action was not required. Indeed the US and its allies currently claim that their action was on a humanitarian basis and intended to address Iraq's internal issues (specifically Saddam's rather brutal regime) rather than in response to a failure on the part of Iraq to meet its obligations.

Lets not pretend that Iraq had or was producing WMD's at the time when it was claimed by the US (Iraq undoubtedly had WMD previously and has used them in the past, weapons that were both of domestic origin and weapons sourced from its western allies to be used against Iran) or that the war in Iraq was justifiable on the basis of UN resolutions or as a defensive move.  Of course Israel's violations of existing UN resolutions are really of no concern either, they don't really address the current crisis, not to mention that the process the UN security council would need to go through to sanction Israel (or indeed Palestine) is not likely to fail due to veto's by permanent members on behalf of the combatants.

The UN should arrive at a new resolution that ensures that both the Palestinians and Israelis no longer face a threat from each others military and militants.  Such a resolution should make it possible for the international community to safeguard both Palestine and Israel and prevent the suffering that is ongoing due to the cycle of reprisal and revenge attacks that are now commonplace.  

Realistically Israel is in breach of its obligations under international law (in the way it is using its military now and in the way it has been treating the Palestinians) and Hamas and Fatah (And any number of other militant groups) have clearly been attacking civilian targets and acting in an illegitimate manner.  Neither side seems to want to ceasefire and actually pursue peace, so it seems logical that, if possible, the international community (such as it is) should impose a peace on both parties, using force if appropriate.

As a final note I will add that the last part of the above statement is clearly a pipe dream.  There does not exist a will to interfere in the region in a manner not sanctioned by the US, any action by (for the sake of argument) the EU, Russia or China would be resisted by all sides and condemned by the US, as such it is (regardless of how popular it would be with their own populations) extremely unlikely.",True,,9r6p,True,0,1231042929,ajehals,2,2,0

As I said, Orwell's feelings about Communists are well known, and both extracts I quoted (1984 and the _Animal Farm_ preface) are typical of his comments. Are you aware that he ""spied"" on British socialists, and named 35 people he accused of being ""crypto-Communists"" to the British Secret Service?

http://www.nybooks.com/articles/16550

In the 1984 passage he's not ""singling out the left"" for condemnation - he's saying that, despite the comtemporary adulation shown towards Stalin and the Soviet system by writers like George Bernard Shaw, that they're just the same as the Nazis. That's not letting Fascists off the hook (this was immediately after WWII), but it is a condemnation of the pro-Soviet movements in Europe who claimed the Communist system was different from the Nazi system. Orwell thought otherwise. 

&gt; I think that's not as subtle as he intended it - he was an extremely nuanced writer and thinker.

Neither ""subtle"" nor ""nuance"" are words I would choose to describe any of his writing (and I've read a lot of it). He was forthright and principled, especially in _1984_ and _Animal Farm_ - another obvious critique of the Communist system. But whatever you think, he surely wasn't so ""subtle"" and ""nuanced"" that he'd write contradictory material to somehow fool people into thinking the opposite of what he's written. What he's condemning is the willing blindness of much of the left wing (of which he considered himself a member) towards the atrocities of the Communists system - he says this explicitly in the Animal Farm extract above. 

Unfortunately much of the modern left is equally blind today. And their revisionist attitude to _1984_, that it somehow lets Communism off the hook - that despite his obvious intent, he's _not_ talking about a Communist England under an Uncle Joe figure - is a perfect example of this thinking.

He talks about the common myths of mankind and how different cultures on different continents that never met had very, very similar religions/myths.

From wikipedia:

Accordingly, Campbell believed the religions of the world to be the various, culturally influenced “masks” of the same fundamental, transcendent truths. All religions, including Christianity and Buddhism, can bring one to an elevated awareness above and beyond a dualistic conception of reality, or idea of “pairs of opposites,” such as being and non-being, or right and wrong. Indeed, he quotes in the preface of The Hero with a Thousand Faces: ""Truth is one, the sages speak of it by many names."" which is a translation of the Rig Vedic saying ""Ekam Sat Vipra Bahuda Vadanthi.""

Campbell was fascinated with what he viewed as basic, universal truths, expressed in different manifestations across different cultures. For example, in the preface of The Hero with a Thousand Faces, he indicated that a goal of his was to demonstrate similarities between Eastern and Western religions. In his four-volume series of books ""The Masks of God"", Campbell tried to summarize the main spiritual threads common throughout the world. Tied in with this, was his idea that many of the belief systems of the world which expressed these universal truths had a common geographic ancestry, starting off on the fertile grasslands of Europe in the Bronze Age and moving to the Levant and the ""Fertile Crescent"" of Mesopotamia and back to Europe (and the Far East), where it was mixed with the newly emerging Indo-European (Aryan) culture.",False,,9vf6,True,0,1231062453,troubleondemand,3,3,0

No one wants peace less than the Israelis. The Israeli mindset is fuelled by conflict and violence.

And he is correct that science are metaphors. It's a way of explaining observations. But for some engineers, gravity or pressure are not metaphors or explanations but truths. And that's really bad if you try to find things out, but of course irrelevant if you want to build things and just use the best known concepts/tools. That's why some engineers really don't know what to think of relativity, quantum mechanics or any of the more recent attempts to describe what happens where the concepts/tools they are used to, don't work. At least if they don't have to use these concepts. For example most civil engineers I know ( I don't know many, I admit) already ""know"" that string theory is wrong, because atoms are little dots and not strings, just like 50 years ago they knew gravity doesn't bend space, because a heavy piece of metal doesn't bend space either.

What you say about religion is at least not the modern European (Catholic or Protestant) Christian understanding of the bible. If you don't understand the bible literally but as metaphors, it isn't a holy text God literally gave them.

We can't know *anything* for sure! But if we have to choose from two ""metaphors"", choosing the totally unfounded one that is contradicted by tons of evidence (like Creationism) over a scientific (like Evolution) one, that explains best what we know, is really dumb.

You can only see when it's false, and use this information to find a better one.

Remember that keeping an army up needs lots of money and that money you get both from the US and from the trade with Europe, if you loose either your economy and military will collapse.

What you don't notice is that your neighboring Arab countries are not democracies. Their governments maybe either bought by the Americans or they try to object against Iran's influence, but their citizens for sure don't like what is happening in Israel.

The problem with Israels nuclear weapons is that nobody knows how well they work or will they work at all. The thing with nuclear weapons is they when they get older they start to decay and if Israel hasn't gotten info either from US or from France about what happens to those weapons in time, Israels nuclear weapons are a card unknown. You also don't count in that as the Arab countries develop they will get better technology and better defensive capabilities including working air and missile defense and when they get that then Israel nuclear weapons are more or less useless.

Israel is living in borrowed time because its a tiny country with 7 million people while its surrounded by hundred million more or less unfriendly Arabs. That is not a formula for success.

First, many economists consider a pure market as a non-zero-sum game. Therefore, you would need to conclude, following your own logic, that selfishness is good because ""it benefits the group and is entirely rational in non-zero-sum scenarios.""

Consequently, selfish and altruistic behaviours are both ""good"". So what's the point discussing this?

Second, there's a third option between (pure) altruistic and (pure) selfish behaviour, namley what I'd like to call ""selfish altruistic"" behaviour.

The third option is typically used in theoretical biology to explain why ants, for example, appear to be altruistic from an evolutionarly point of view: they do so because genes that favour altruistic behaviour favour themselves by improving the likelihood of survival of the queen which is a close relative to any ant.

In short, selfish altrustic behaviour may described as ""Other person wins, therefore you win, too.""

In fact, you used this explanantion yourself when you speculated that your friend - when saved from the bear -- is likely to reprociate the favour. This is like saying: ""It makes sense to attack the bear and save my friend, for he might do the same thing for me, too, one day."" This is not pure altruistic behaviour, this is selfish altruistic behaviour.

Third -- and most important --, your argument falls short because you argue from the ""group's point of view"". Strictly speaking, any ""group"" is an abstract concept that has no will, no emotions, and no rationality. In other words: A group is not a person, so why should anybody act as if it were?

You said: from the group's perspective, it doesn't matter who dies. But the group has no interest, whatsoever. It can't make judgments. It can't act. In summery, it only exists in our imagination. So why should anybody care about the group's perspective? It's just a metaphor!

Therefore, all arguments that claim rationality from a group's point of view fail: To act rational, you need to have preferences (wishes, needs). But what are the preferences of a metaphor? It has none, therefore it can't act rational.

Of course, peope will be quick to assume arbitraily preferences for the group. But usually it's just their own preferences, hidden in the rhetoric. For example, you stated the ""group"" is indifferent who dies. But what makes you think so? You also said, the group prefers that both live and none dies. But what makes you think so? The group is a metaphor, therefore we could also assume it prefers everybody to die and none to live. It's just as likely.

You may say that the preference of the group is simply an aggregation of the member's preferences. Unfortunatly, it can be shown that just three members may have preferences that cannot be simply aggregated, see  [Arrow's Impossibility Theorem](http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/arrow.htm).

So: All I can take care of is my interest, my judgements, and my actions. Therefore, I'll run when a bear attacks. And I have no problem with my friend trying to run as fast as he can, too.

For maybe, we both are fast enought to out-run the bear. In fact, it's more likely to survive by out-running a bear -- humans are made to run -- than by attacking him. This way, my and my friends individual selfish actions may result in -- what you called -- a ""HUGE social benefit"": we both survive.

For these reasons I don't agree with your conclusion: Selfishness may also be rational in the long run.

Additionally, you failed to prove that pure altruistic behaviour is ""rational"", at all.",False,,a14t,True,0,1231094167,Rufus_22,2,2,0

There is, let us say, a certain filthy rookery in Hoxton, dripping with disease and honeycombed with crime and promiscuity. There are, let us say, two noble and courageous young men, of pure intentions and (if you prefer it) noble birth; let us call them Hudge and Gudge. Hudge, let us say, is of a bustling sort; he points out that the people must at all costs be got out of this den; he subscribes and collects money, but he finds (despite the large financial interests of the Hudges) that the thing will have to be done on the cheap if it is to be done on the spot. He therefore, runs up a row of tall bare tenements like beehives; and soon has all the poor people bundled into their little brick cells, which are certainly better than their old quarters, in so far as they are weather proof, well ventilated and supplied with clean water. But Gudge has a more delicate nature. He feels a nameless something lacking in the little brick boxes; he raises numberless objections; he even assails the celebrated Hudge Report, with the Gudge Minority Report; and by the end of a year or so has come to telling Hudge heatedly that the people were much happier where they were before. As the people preserve in both places precisely the same air of dazed amiability, it is very difficult to find out which is right. But at least one might safely say that no people ever liked stench or starvation as such, but only some peculiar pleasures en tangled with them. Not so feels the sensitive Gudge. Long before the final quarrel (Hudge v. Gudge and Another), Gudge has succeeded in persuading himself that slums and stinks are really very nice things; that the habit of sleeping fourteen in a room is what has made our England great; and that the smell of open drains is absolutely essential to the rearing of a viking breed.

But, meanwhile, has there been no degeneration in Hudge? Alas, I fear there has. Those maniacally ugly buildings which he originally put up as unpretentious sheds barely to shelter human life, grow every day more and more lovely to his deluded eye. Things he would never have dreamed of defending, except as crude necessities, things like common kitchens or infamous asbestos stoves, begin to shine quite sacredly before him, merely because they reflect the wrath of Gudge. He maintains, with the aid of eager little books by Socialists, that man is really happier in a hive than in a house. The practical difficulty of keeping total strangers out of your bedroom he describes as Brotherhood; and the necessity for climbing twenty-three flights of cold stone stairs, I dare say he calls Effort. The net result of their philanthropic adventure is this: that one has come to defending indefensible slums and still more indefensible slum-landlords, while the other has come to treating as divine the sheds and pipes which he only meant as desperate. Gudge is now a corrupt and apoplectic old Tory in the Carlton Club; if you mention poverty to him he roars at you in a thick, hoarse voice something that is conjectured to be ""Do 'em good!"" Nor is Hudge more happy; for he is a lean vegetarian with a gray, pointed beard and an unnaturally easy smile, who goes about telling everybody that at last we shall all sleep in one universal bedroom; and he lives in a Garden City, like one forgotten of God.

Such is the lamentable history of Hudge and Gudge; which I merely introduce as a type of an endless and exasperating misunderstanding which is always occurring in modern England. To get men out of a rookery men are put into a tenement; and at the beginning the healthy human soul loathes them both. A man's first desire is to get away as far as possible from the rookery, even should his mad course lead him to a model dwelling. The second desire is, naturally, to get away from the model dwelling, even if it should lead a man back to the rookery. But I am neither a Hudgian nor a Gudgian; and I think the mistakes of these two famous and fascinating persons arose from one simple fact. They arose from the fact that neither Hudge nor Gudge had ever thought for an instant what sort of house a man might probably like for himself. In short, they did not begin with the ideal; and, therefore, were not practical politicians.

We may now return to the purpose of our awkward parenthesis about the praise of the future and the failures of the past. A house of his own being the obvious ideal for every man, we may now ask (taking this need as typical of all such needs) why he hasn't got it; and whether it is in any philosophical sense his own fault. Now, I think that in some philosophical sense it is his own fault, I think in a yet more philosophical sense it is the fault of his philosophy. And this is what I have now to attempt to explain.

Burke, a fine rhetorician, who rarely faced realities, said, I think, that an Englishman's house is his castle. This is honestly entertaining; for as it happens the Englishman is almost the only man in Europe whose house is not his castle. Nearly everywhere else exists the assumption of peasant proprietorship; that a poor man may be a landlord, though he is only lord of his own land. Making the landlord and the tenant the same person has certain trivial advantages, as that the tenant pays no rent, while the landlord does a little work. But I am not concerned with the defense of small proprietorship, but merely with the fact that it exists almost everywhere except in England. It is also true, however, that this estate of small possession is attacked everywhere today; it has never existed among ourselves, and it may be destroyed among our neighbors. We have, therefore, to ask ourselves what it is in human affairs generally, and in this domestic ideal in particular, that has really ruined the natural human creation, especially in this country.

Man has always lost his way. He has been a tramp ever since Eden; but he always knew, or thought he knew, what he was looking for. Every man has a house somewhere in the elaborate cosmos; his house waits for him waist deep in slow Norfolk rivers or sunning itself upon Sussex downs. Man has always been looking for that home which is the subject matter of this book. But in the bleak and blinding hail of skepticism to which he has been now so long subjected, he has begun for the first time to be chilled, not merely in his hopes, but in his desires. For the first time in history he begins really to doubt the object of his wanderings on the earth. He has always lost his way; but now he has lost his address.

Under the pressure of certain upper-class philosophies (or in other words, under the pressure of Hudge and Gudge) the average man has really become bewildered about the goal of his efforts; and his efforts, therefore, grow feebler and feebler. His simple notion of having a home of his own is derided as bourgeois, as sentimental, or as despicably Christian. Under various verbal forms he is recommended to go on to the streets—which is called Individualism; or to the work-house—which is called Collectivism. We shall consider this process somewhat more carefully in a moment. But it may be said here that Hudge and Gudge, or the governing class generally, will never fail for lack of some modern phrase to cover their ancient predominance. The great lords will refuse the English peasant his three acres and a cow on advanced grounds, if they cannot refuse it longer on reactionary grounds. They will deny him the three acres on grounds of State Ownership. They will forbid him the cow on grounds of humanitarianism.

And this brings us to the ultimate analysis of this singular influence that has prevented doctrinal demands by the English people. There are, I believe, some who still deny that England is governed by an oligarchy. It is quite enough for me to know that a man might have gone to sleep some thirty years ago over the day's newspaper and woke up last week over the later newspaper, and fancied he was reading about the same people. In one paper he would have found a Lord Robert Cecil, a Mr. Gladstone, a Mr. Lyttleton, a Churchill, a Chamberlain, a Trevelyan, an Acland. In the other paper he would find a Lord Robert Cecil, a Mr. Gladstone, a Mr. Lyttleton, a Churchill, a Chamberlain, a Trevelyan, an Acland. If this is not being governed by families I cannot imagine what it is. I suppose it is being governed by extraordinary democratic coincidences.

Therefore, you would need to conclude, following your own logic, that selfishness is good because ""it benefits the group and is entirely rational in non-zero-sum scenarios.""

Eh? 

Zero sum scenarios are *""my gain comes at your lose""* situations. The total sum of utility cancels each other out and results in zero. A good example is the Prisoner's Dilemma.

Non zero sum scenarios are ""my lose is your lose, my gains are your gains"". The total sum of utility results in a positive or negative number (non-zero).

The optimal strategy in zero-sum scenarios is selfishness. Either my gain comes at your lose or your lose comes at my gain....which means I want to be selfish and gain for myself because the alternative is my lose. 

Conversely, the optimal strategy in non-zero-sum scenarios is co-operation. If I wish to gain, I must co-operate with you and we bother gain.

So I'm not sure we're on the same page here...

There is a difference between ""selfishness"" and ""self-interest"". All actions are self-interested in both scenarios but not all actions are selfish.

Selfishness is explicitly doing something that benefits you at the expense of other people.

Altruism is the opposite of Selfishness and is explicitly doing something that benefits others at the expense of yourself. 

Selfishness is blameworthy. Altruism is praiseworthy.

&gt; your argument falls short because you argue from the ""group's point of view"". Strictly speaking, any ""group"" is an abstract concept that has no will, no emotions, and no rationality. In other words: A group is not a person, so why should anybody act as if it were? You said: from the group's perspective, it doesn't matter who dies. But the group has no interest, whatsoever. It can't make judgments. It can't act. In summery, it only exists in our imagination. So why should anybody care about the group's perspective? It's just a metaphor!

Are you high? &lt;3

What about the country you live in? Is that not a ""group""? What about the laws that govern the country you belong to? Are they not representative of values of ""the group""? What about culture? What about politics and social dynamics? Sure, they are ""abstract concepts"" but they are very real abstract concepts which we as human beings have adopted and they describe ""the group"" and have causal implications.

Human beings are social creatures. We have been living in groups since the first instance of our species. It is incredibly fallacious to claim ""the group"" exists in **our** imagination and claim it has not real life implications.

If you want to argue epistemology and claim *""The only thing I know is that I exist""* then fine, you can be as selfish as you want and be entirely rational. I just warn you that you're going to be one delusional and lonely person.

I'm being cruel though and you've made some insightful comments.

1) Genes.

Altruism is typically explained and justified through the ""self-interests"" of our genes. I suppose we can accept that angle of analysis. It only strengthens my claim that Altruism is good because it is intrinsic to humanity.

However I still think selfishness is irrational. Selfishness is counter-intuitive to our collective mentalities and is an irrationally short-sight version of self-interest.

Selfishness is NOT self-interest (assuming we adopt Robert Wright's definition). 

I'm not sure what you're trying to say when you say you haven't read Ayn Rand or Robert Wright because you're European....Don't Europeans read books anymore? You don't need to read a book, just google the names and get a general gist of their theories...

According to [Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/selfishness), it means ""concerned excessively or exclusively with oneself : seeking or concentrating on one's own advantage, pleasure, or well-being without regard for others.""

Note that ""without regard for others"" does not make any assumptions about their well-being! Others may be better even though I'm selfish.

This is a very common when there are positive network effects: I may like to have a beautiful garden. When I'm selfish, my efforts to create such a garden are independent of whether others like it or not.

Let's say you like my garden and receive pleasure by having a look at it. Then, you're better off although I'm selfish.

Being selfish has nothing to do with other's well-being. Sometimes, my pursuit of being better-off may affect other's negatively, sometimes positively, and sometimes not at all.

Using this definition, you can't say whether being selfish is good or bad, in general (and presuming you're judging actions by their consequences.)

So, maybe this is what you (and Robert Wright) means when talking about self-interest. I just followed the more common definition.

You also got to be careful about non-zero-sum games: Let's say I want to sell something for at least $15, you want to buy it for at most $25. Whatever the price of the transaction, society will be better of by $10.

But nowhere it's been said that any of us will be better off: we might agree on a price of $25 and you may accept since you make no loss. We might also agree on $15 and I may accept since I make no loss. A non-zero-sum game is not strictly a win-win situation for both. It may also be a win-no-loss situation.

Sure, people are social animals and the fact has consequences. We somehow need to organize the social lives. However, that doesn't mean that the concept of decision making can be applied to a construct called ""group"" or ""society"". The ""group"" does not make decisions and it does not act according to them.

Of course, being part of the conflict, you will see the 'enemy' as being worse then yourselves. Just count the victims made, and then I am not even talking about other ways of suppression. 

&gt; the army which has so far produced ridiculously low number of innocent civilian casualties.

We are talking about hundreds in the last week. How many innocent victims Israeli victims from Hamas rockets? How many houses destroyed?

&gt; I hope no more civilians get killed, but if they do, I am going to only blame Hamas for it

Israel kills civilians, Hamas is to blame? This is not making any sense. 

&gt; I asked you a direct question.

I gave you quite an understandable answer: if you want to be 'right' in the eyes of the world (and you apparently want to be), then you should keep the violent responses proportional. 

&gt; We are at war and our civilians are under a daily threat of death.

There are more people dying from traffic accidents then from Hamas rockets. Nevertheless I do understand that Israel wants to end it. But As I said: Israeli violence is provoking more violence. The Palestinians already have almost nothing to lose. The Israeli attacks will only bring more people over the edge of believing in islamic theocracy and returning the violence. Only people in trouble turn to religion and the deeper the trouble the more radical the religion.

In other words: the Israeli approach is not going to bring you peace nor safety. You are not winning a war, you are not even at war. Israel is basically violently invading a refugee camp that it has created itself and has mostly locked of from the rest of the world. The people from this refugee camp send some toy rockets over the borders, which sometimes do some damage and rarely kill someone. But remember Israel has treated them very badly. 

&gt; Unilateral withdrawal to 1967 border as a result of Hamas pressure would forever seal the arab terrorism as a working technique to control the western interests

I am sorry, but being from Western Europe, I see no 'western interests' lost, even if the country of Israel ceased to exists. Israel is not some sort of Western outpost in the Arab world. The founding of Israel is in hindsight more like a historic mistake for which the West is paying dearly. 

The Arab world is complicated enough without Israel.

Maybe you don't care about my opinion or maybe you think that I would think differently when I was in Israel or maybe you'd even want to convince me of your opinions. 

My point is however that Israel has lost over the years my respect. I know that I am not alone in this. This whole discussion started with the ""Israeli explanation department"". Personally I feel that much of the Israeli aggression is beyond explanation.

It is not that I particularly like Hamas or any islamic inspired violence. But it would be nice if Israel either stopped claiming being 'western' or started behaving themselves a bit more civilized. That includes trying to see the human side of Palestinians and understand why Hamas is getting the support it is getting. Israel creates the support for Hamas.

This is a military conflict. Just because it is playing out on civilian territory does not mean that the operation should be aborted. Justification of our actions is 8 years of rocket fire on Sderot; dozens of suicide bombings totalling hundreds of victims, kidnapping of our soldier, and many many more things Hamas and friends did in the past without any repercussion. If we limit the response to ""proportional"" Hamas can sustain war against Israel indefinitely. Is this an acceptable outcome to you? To us it is not. It is absurd to propose that Israel fights ""fair"" in the war that consists entirely of dirty tricks.

&gt; Israel has been treating Palestinians very poorly, to say the least. It is no wonder that they protest and it is no wonder that the protests escalate if Israel responds the way it does.

True, but why exactly are they exempt from the rules of initiation of aggression and military conflict? Because Ilan Pappe says so? I'm sorry, no one is going to sacrifice the citizens or national security because of a condemned conspiracy theory. Since when protesting equals fighting? If you attack someone, you accept the consequences of the fight, do you not? If you protest, the truth is on your side, is it not?

&gt; All I am saying is that Israel takes the wrong path in choosing military violence as a solution.

It is *not* a solution, or *the* solution. It is a military operation which is meant to nullify Hamas capacity to shoot rockets. Antizionists here will list you all the names for it: genocide, nazism, racism, massacre, rape, atrocity, whatever, but the fact remains that this has nothing to do with any of these things **any more than other military conflict**.

&gt; You might succeed in creating a temporal drop in actual violence towards Israel by harming the organization structure.

So the only solution is to surrender on whatever terms Hamas dictates, is that what you're saying? That because of our moral values, we should allow the enemy to dictate terms of the surrender because the enemy is using civilians to protect themselves? And if this works for Hamas this time, what if the next time they demand Tel Aviv be purged of jews? Are we going to turn over Tel Aviv? That's absurd.

&gt; I would like to avoid to make it an issue of Jews and to refer to the Holocaust

Yes, you are correct, Holocaust has nothing to do with this although, you must understand, for Jewish people it is impossible to remove it from their perspective. The people who suffered it are still alive and they still tell their tales.

My point was not this. I have very carefully examined nearly every reddit submission related to Israel since the war started. I see very clear patterns in the talking points, I see the same arguments and unfounded accusations that were used in every single case Israel went to war; but above all, I see that underneath most of this criticism of Israel is not a genuine intent to protect the gazans or help them, but a sinister coordinated attempt to villify Israel and peddle traditional conspiracy theories, which are oh so popular in the arab world. Electronic Intifada, Uruknet, Rense, WhatReallyHappened et al - all the arguments about Israel are emanating from there, and these are hate sites manned by racists, who do not mind at all lying and perverting the truth because, according to their reasoning, if jews didn't do something bad then they are about to so might as well make it up. The storm of anti-Israel submissions to reddit and other social sites serves one purpose: to make people think that it is a completely legitimate idea that Israel should be abolished, and that jews are evil people. This *is* antisemitism, it is acting through deception and distortion and it is racism in its purest form. It is something that scares and sickens me. 

&gt; And I even do not think that this is a sign of desperation but of planned bad intentions of the Hamas leadership.

It is, and there is no way to fight it other than by burning it out with fire. We have tried everything. We have arab countries lining up eager to open discussions between Hamas and Israel RIGHT NOW; but what does Hamas do? They hide in their holes and lie about how many IDF soldiers they killed.

&gt; The thing is that you have to offer an alternative to the people who have brought Hamas to power.

The alternative has been offered to them. Many times. This time, it was offered to them that they cease firing rockets and IDF withdraws. But no, said Hamas, what do we care about the people whom we make targets? We're more interested in more martyrdom for the great cause of liberation of Palestine. Then, they went into hiding and left the population around their rocket piles to be bodies.

My personal genuine wish is complete cessation of hostilities and independent state for the arabs, but this simply can not happen as long as there are unaccountable terrorist groups running the show. You give them a finger and they gnaw off your head, and then proceed to urinate on your dead body.

&gt; Israel has the power to end the violence.

True. Sometimes it is so obvious to me that I feel I should say fuck it and start my own peace movement. But this can not be in the form of a sudden onset of pacifism in the middle of mass attacks on Israeli citizens. Arabs have committed no less cruel atrocities against us; why is it that on their side there is not a single voice of radical pacifism like there is in Israel, Europe, USA and even on reddit?

So for the average joe, he's 401K is going to be shitty in a down market and good in a up market.  So, I think they are catering to that.


2.  I'm not an expert, but from what I understand: 

A)  A lot of it is political.  Big firms had to 'pay' for a seat (so they could get on the floor and trade).  So they bought a ton of seats in the 80s or 90s and then when the tech caught up, these big firms didn't want to lose their ""investment"" on those seats.  

Since they are big customers, they can influence the exchange to an extent.  If all your big customers have bought seats and want to keep those seats, it would be bad business to move everything electronic at once and fuck over your best/biggest customers.  So they do this half assed attempt that doesn't work to well, but pacifies the big companies that paid a lot of money for those seats.



B) for odd lots and big trades, people want to talk to a real person (to work a deal, to spread out the execution, etc) and not just cram a 250,000 quantity buy order into their electronic terminal.

There is probably a few others reasons also.  A lot of it has to do with ""history"".  Legacy crap that is hard to get rid of.  I think anyone that works in IT has been involved in a system like that before.  The market systems are huge though, so no one really wants to do a complete overhaul [i guess].

There are a few 100% electronic exchanges.  The biggest I know of [USA at least], is ISE - it's an option exchange.

I also believe that there are some Europe and Asia systems are 100% electronic.

I am against the actions of both Israel and Hamas. Both sides have demonstrated nothing but contempt for the lives of their own people and their enemies.

Hamas is simply the sad byproduct of the failures of the last twenty years by both Israeli and Palestinian leaders. The incompetence and corruption of Fatah, Israel's unwillingness to give even an inch when it comes to settlements, closure, and occupation. The total lack of commitment to achieving peace. Now you have Hamas, which is counterproductive to both Israeli and Palestinian security and any hopes each have for living in peaceful states of their own.

I went through and opened every hidden comments link and I still cannot find it. So I'm just going to post this at the top level.

The comment kicking this off was something like:

&gt; the US has been fucking with foreign countries for about the last thirty years...

30 years? Try over a hundred years... 150 even... No, the entire fucking history of this country is drenched in blood: murder, rape, theft, biological warfare, psychological warefare, occupation, humiliation, and mutilation.

[This bit from Bowling for Columbine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pg1QuYv__wY) sums up just a small fraction of our murderous ways. And don't give me any BS about Michael Moore being a blowhard... he's just the messenger. All of these actions are public record at this point. But there are also centuries of slavery and mistreatment (to put it mildly) of African and Native Americans on our record. And we are actually going **backwards!** In 2003 we invaded a sovereign nation on the basis of completely fabricated propaganda. This was not only immoral but completely illegal by our own laws and the international laws that WE PUT INTO PLACE in the after math of WW II, saying that ""to initiate a war of aggression is the supreme crime against humanity"".

Please note that I'm not trying to attack you here; I think we are coming from the same ballpark. Your use of ""30 years"" just provided me with a convenient jumping in point. I am actually quite stunned at the overall tone in this discussion. I had foolishly started to think that there were some smart, reasonable people in this website's audience. If there are, they seem to be a tiny minority today (I think this is actually due to otherwise relatively smart and progressive thinkers being duped by decades of Israel's propaganda).

First off, the fucking rockets from Mexico (or Canada) analogy: a better one would be that the Paiute are launching rockets from the Warm Springs Reservation in Oregon towards Portland. Note that I'm just picking on the Paiute as an analogy for the militants launching the rockets; not trying to insinuate that the Paiute are more militant than other confederated tribes. Hamas is not going to abandon those firing the rockets by publicly condemning their actions, but it is certainly the case that not all of Hamas -- and definitely not all Palestinians -- endorse their actions. However all the confederated tribes in Warm Springs would suffer our wrath.

And we also need to make a little adjustment to the current Warm Springs situation to make this analogy fit more closely. Pretend that we had not only pushed the confederated tribes onto the reservation (forcing them from their ancestral lands and killing many in the process), but also built a wall around it, denied anyone from leaving, and stopped the flow of goods (medicine, food, building materials, etc.) into the reservation. (I think we have actually done some of this stuff at times, but I don't have the data handy... and I think US/Warm Springs relations are quite warm at this point... we're happy to give them lots of our money in return for fireworks that are just a couple notches below pro and for the adrenaline rush of ""beating the odds"".) The tribes would be living with double-digit unemployment, raw sewage in the streets, rampant disease and malnutrition, and the ever-present threat of their loved ones being obliterated before their eyes by a ""surgical strike"" from Portland.

We would be demanding that the tribes recognize the right of the United States of America to exist (which, for the purposes of this analogy, they would be denying). We would tell the whole world that we are just protecting our own, responding to unwarranted aggression from terrorists (Native Americans were the classic ""terrorists"" for most of the 19th century... labeled as such by invading Europeans who were certainly doing plenty of terrorizing). And then we would be reluctantly ""forced"" to kill hundreds of people in the reservation with our weaponry that is light years more sophisticated than anything the Paiute have.

But really, I shouldn't even be stooping to the level of analogies or wasting bits on excuses and justifications. The solution to all this is breathtakingly simple (as in ""not complex""), seems to be the hardest thing for the vast majority of the human race to accept. We are taught it in kindergarten, but most of us never really learn it, or if we do, we forget it before high school. This idea is simply (in the oft-repeated words of my father) ""be a peacemaker, not a troublemaker"".

If everyone followed this simple belief, the world would be a much, much happier place. Our political leaders profess to following this, but their actions are quite different, generally with the bullshit qualification that ""we have no other choice"". Israel would not have nearly the level of military sophistication the do had the US given them such [disproportionate aid.](http://www.ifamericansknew.org/stats/usaid.html)

And, yes, I realize that the Palestinians should be expected to follow this tenet as well. However, another nugget of wisdom from my father is that ""you are older, so you have to set the example"". This was especially poignant to me because I am the middle brother, so I both benefited from and was endlessly frustrated by this law in our household.

But even when I was was frustrated to no end by it, I knew deep down that its logic was irrefutable: the only way to break a cycle of violence is by a unilateral decision to stop. And as outside ""fathers"", we should admonish both parties to stop, but lean on the stronger party -- the one with more to lose -- to set the example. This means not only putting an end to naked aggression, but also putting an end to the passive aggression (the blockade, the propaganda, etc.) In fact, the most assured way for the conflict to end *immediately* is for Israel -- which has far more wealth and resources -- to accommodate *and aid* the Palestinians.

Rather than demand that the Palestinians acknowledge Israel's right to exist, they should be saying ""we fully understand your deep-seated passion for this land because we feel it strongly as well; what could we help you with in order that we might live together in peace and harmony on this hallowed ground?"" They should then do **exactly** what the Palestinians ask them to do, and if they cannot or if the Palestinians say ""there is nothing you can do; get the fuck out"", the Israelis should live up to their religious beliefs and take the moral high ground. They should then appeal to the international community, not for help in forcing Palestine to submit to their will, but for kindness, compassion and someplace to live. They should maintain this belief forever, not with the hope that the Palestinians will someday be shamed into relenting.

Of course, this also applies to the party with less to lose (the only thing Palestinians have left to lose at this point is the argument). However, having nothing to lose also means having little to offer. Israel is a wealthy country with strong industry and lots of high tech know-how. They have a much better chance of making co-existence work by using their wealth as an incentive.

Of course, the US can never ask Israel to do this, because we would have to put our money where our mouth is. However, we could certainly stop giving Israel [so much aid](http://www.ifamericansknew.org/stats/usaid.html) without an outright condemnation of their actions. Hey, we could bail out at least another two or three banks with that money. Hell, for that matter we should shutter most of [our more than 700 military bases around the globe](http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0115-08.htm) and bring all those soldiers home. If they need a job we can put them to work **rebuilding** our decaying infrastructure instead of destroying the infrastructure of others using mind-bogglingly expensive weapons.

But anyway, this is getting very long. I realize that this is a pipe dream. People who successfully follow humanism are certainly and sadly a minority. I myself fail, because I don't think I could bring myself to let someone kill me to avoid committing an act of violence.

However, we can say for certain that contributing to endless discussions of ""who is more justified"" and ""who is the aggressor"" and the like does not help solve the problem. It is probably the greatest gift of the internet to society that we are now more connected than ever before; it is becoming easier and easier for people to speak out and to larger and larger groups. If we use that power to preach a message of peace over and over and over, it will gradually take hold. It is not always the easiest thing to do, but it is the *good* thing to do.

Now where is the anti-semitism?

For the entire history of the Lesser Jihad against Israel, the promptings of that war from Islam itself have been largely obscured, obscured most of all from the Israelis themselves.

The original opposition of the Arabs to Jews buying land from landowners was naturally muted as long as the Arabs needed Western power to help them against the Turks. But as the earliest leader of the local Arabs -- they were not then, not until after the Six-Day War, renamed the ""Palestinians"" -- the mufti El Husseini -- made clear, it was Muslims who opposed them, and it should be a common Muslim cause. It took quite a while. Arabs under French rule in North Africa, or miserably poor, and certainly distant from, whatever happened in Mandatory Palestine, would hardly have been in a position to participate in the Lesser Jihad, much less something wider in scope. The Dutch ruled in the East Indies; the British controlled India -- in neither place did the Muslims possess the wherewithal to dream more dangerous dreams. Jihad never went away -- how could it? -- but the wherewithal to conduct Jihad was lacking.

In 1947, the Bishop of Beirut, Moubarac, understood clearly the Muslim basis of the Arab assault on Israel. His speech can be found in Bat Ye'or's Islam and Dhimmitude. The Jews of Israel, however, saw the conflict as one of Arabs who were opposed to the Jews. They knew very little, almost nothing, about Islam. They also knew that many of the local Arab Christians were echoing the sentiments of local Arab Muslims, and assumed, wrongly, that this meant that it was the ""Arabs"" who were hostile to them. They failed to realize that many of the local Arab Christians were classic dhimmis, who had accepted and internalized Muslim attitudes. That this phenomenon was observable in many communities of non-Muslims under Muslim rule was simply not understood.

The rhetoric of the 1948 attack contained all kinds of allusions to Islam. Azzam Pasha, Secretary-General of the Arab League (and great-uncle to Ayman al-Zawahiri) promised a massacre like that of the Mongols when they conquered the Jews. The still-weak Arabs, however, needed outside help, diplomatic and economic. They were in no position to start muttering darkly about a Jihad against the West.

Pan-Arabism, with which one associates the name of Nasser and then later of Saddam Hussein, who also saw himself as the Arab champion, the Saladin of our age (it didn't matter that Saladin, another native of Tikrit, was a Kurd), was merely a realistic (for its day) subset of pan-Islamism. It was the Arabs who needed to be unified first, and no one could think beyond that goal. Nasser was hardly a Marxist. He was a local despot, with great appeal to Arab youths. This is one of the themes, played on a little too insistently and a little too plangently, by Fouad Ajami in his ""predicament"" of the Arabs, his ""dream palace"" of the Arabs shtick that very carefully avoids the subject of Islam.

The ""secularists"" were never that secular. If Nasser, and then Sadat, treated the Ikhwan, the Muslim Brotherhood, as a menace, it is because they were a menace to them -- a political rival. But this did not make Sadat, in particular, a ""secularist"" (he actually favored, at times, the Muslim Brotherhood). Saddam Hussein was a Ba'athist because it allowed him to continue to pretend to have a regime open to all, Kurds as well as Arabs, Christians as well as Muslims, Shi'a Muslims as well as Sunni Muslims. And some of them were part of the government. But the real power remained that of Sunnis, and modern Iraq was essentially a Sunni despotism, mild under the monarchy, harsh from Qassem through to Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein knew perfectly well that the Shi'a far outnumbered the Sunnis, and that the opposition to him was most dangerous in the Shi'a mosques. It was to his advantage to minimize the political role of Islam, therefore, but whenever it suited him, he invoked Islam and Muslim history. The battles he spoke of when attacking Iran were the old battles against the Persians by the Islam-bearing Arabs. He was building the largest mosque in the world. He commissioned a Qur'an calligraphed using his blood for ink. He put a Qur'anic phrase on the flag of Iraq. Whether or not he was a deep Believer (he is now apparently reading the Qur'an with great intensity), he was certainly a Believer.

Against Israel, the rhetoric, the attitudes, the entire refusal to contemplate the permanence of an Infidel sovereign state, can all without difficulty be ascribed to Islam. The local dhimmis, such islamochristians as Hanan Ashrawi and Naim Ateek and others, promote the Muslim view and Muslim demands. That may confuse a few, but it should not confuse anyone familiar with the phenomenon.

The war against Israel is not an ""ethnic"" nor a ""tribal"" war by Arabs against Jews. When rants against Israel are repeated in Pakistan, or by Mahathir Mohamed in Malaysia, or by the assorted Islamic groups in Indonesia, one sees clearly that what is going on is prompted by the belief-system of Islam. It is a war against a non-Muslim state, by as many Muslims as care to participate. Some may have in the past been held in check by their own dislike of the Arabs. The Iranians and the Turks both make insistently clear that ""we are not Arabs"" and then go on to speak contemptuously of the Arabs. For a while, the national interests of Iran, as defined by the Shah and his advanced if corrupt coterie, included fair treatment of non-Muslims, and a reasonable attitude toward, even a kind of quasi-alliance, with Israel. Something of the sort seems to have developed, later on, between not Turkey but rather between the keepers-of-the-Kemalist-flame in the Turkish army, and some of its secularists, and Israel.

To assume that the war between the Arabs and Israel is ethnic or tribal ignores the rhetoric, the appeals, the views of Muslims as expressed through time and space. It ignores the simplest and most obvious truth: the entire world in the end belongs to Allah and his people, the best of people. And Israel, a sovereign state run by Jews, is a particular affront, not only for where it is situated (seeming to break up the continuity of one uninterrupted Arab Muslim landmass, as Arab Muslims see it -- for them the Maronites, the Copts, the Berbers, the Kurds, have no rights, hardly exist in what Arabs, with a little help from ARAMCO, began decades ago calling ""the Arab World"" -- a phrase that misleads, but stuck, so that it keeps on misleading), but because the traditionally despised Jews, despised because they had no power (unlike the local Christians, who at least could look to powerful co-religionists in Western Christendom) were in charge of that sliver of land.

The war of the Arabs against Israel is a ""religious"" war if we consider Islam to be a religion. It is promoted by, it springs from, the tenets, and attitudes, and atmospherics, of Islam. The Muslim Arabs know this. Other Muslims know this. Islamochristian Arabs pretend that it is not so. And the Israelis, of course, prefer not to recognize that it is so, because such recognition would also lead them to conclude, inexorably, that there is no end to this war, and that negotiations are merely occasions for Arab duplicity, as Muhammad (""War is deception"") demonstrated in his own treaty of Al-Hudaibiyya, which he made with the Meccans in 628 A.D., and broke 18 months later, when his side had increased its power. That, as Majid Khadduri notes, is the basis of Muslim treaty-making with Infidels. It always has been; it will remain such.

And the Muslims are not taught to permit Infidels to remain with some sliver of land where their rule will prevail -- especially not on land once held by Muslims. So the recognition by the Israelis of the true nature of the war against them would also force them to conclude that not only are treaties largely pointless, but that there is no end to this, for the size of Israel is irrelevant to its acceptance by the Arab Muslims. If it further shrinks, however, it may tempt an attack, and the only way the peace can be kept is if the Arabs have an excuse not to attack. That excuse can be found in the idea of ""Darura"" or ""necessity,"" which can be invoked to justify inaction by Arab regimes.

Muslim Arabs, local (""Palestinians"") and non-local, understand perfectly why Israel will never be accepted and must in the end disappear. They differ on the instruments through which this may best be achieved. They differ on the amount of time it will take -- there are the Rapid Jihaidsts of Hamas, and Hezbollah, and the Slow Jihadists of Abbas's PLO. But the understanding of what the end result must be, at some point, is shared by all of them.

It is the Israelis, or many of them in the ruling elites, who refuse to see what is staring them in the face. It's too upsetting. It would require seeing control of the ""West Bank"" as indispensable -- control of the marches, of the invasion route, of the aquifers necessary for Israel to live. It would require ending the participation in the farce of this ""Palestinian"" people that the Israelis themselves refer to without any seeming understanding of the way that they thereby promote the ""two-tiny-peoples"" business, that which since the 1967 War began with the careful creation of the ""Palestinian people"" and has been so relentlessly used to present as a matter of competing nationalisms what is, in fact, a classic Jihad. Classic in aim, that is, but not classic in its instruments. For as with Western Europe, outright military conquest is unlikely.

Other methods are being employed and you can see them in France, Britain and even here in the US.  Just think about it.

Various delegations of Syrians and Iraqis attended the Nuremberg party congresses; and there was much pro-German sentiment in Egypt.

&gt;Nazi propaganda broadcasts from Berlin and Stuttgart, as well as broadcasts from fascist Italy, added fuel to the ongoing anti-Jewish campaigns. The Mufti's radio broadcasts were some of the most violent pro-Axis broadcasts ever produced. He had at least six stations - Berlin, Zeissen, Bari, Rome, Tokyo and Athens. He used these radio broadcasts to tell Muslims across the world to commit acts of sabotage and kill the Jews.


&gt;Hitler made it clear that the project of killing Jews was by no means confined to Europe. As he explained to the Mufti, ""his hopes of military victory in Africa and the Middle East would bring about the destruction of Jews in the Arab world."" In November of 1941, Hitler informed the Mufti at a meeting in Berlin that he intended to kill every Jew living in the Arab world, including those in Palestine, as well as ""Syria, Iraq, Iran, the Arabian peninsula, Egypt and French Northwest Africa."" Hitler asserted that, in the event of a German advance into the Middle East, the German objective would be the ""destruction of Judaism"" in Palestine.

[Hate speech](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Hate_speech) is banned in the UK and many other European countries.

[Blasphemy law](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Blasphemy_law_in_the_United_Kingdom) is now historical, but it was still rather unpleasant.

Going down [Wikipedia](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Censorship_in_the_United_Kingdom), there are some things that I've heard of before, and some I haven't:

The UK definition of obscenity is rather wider than the US, and includes anything that has a ""tendency to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences, and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall"".

The UK [Terrorism Act 2006](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Terrorism_Act_2006) makes it illegal to glorify terrorism.  This sort of thing might have been severely looked down upon in the US after 9/11, but the federal government would not ban it.  Even if speech is *very* unpopular, there's a high bar to protecting it.

The US has never attempted to ban videogames, even highly objectionable ones (WP lists Carmageddon as one that was blocked in the UK and only later allowed).  There have been (failed) attempts to create US federal regulation schemes, but not to outright ban.

The UK has had [recent attempts to censor Internet content at the ISP level](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_United_Kingdom) (which recently created problems for Wikipedia).  Australia has seen similar attempts.  In the US, such attempts  get shot down pretty early.

On the other hand, it's not all one-way; for example, US broadcast law (only applying to old analog unencrypted signals, which you can't really choose to skip when

Why should it? My point is that having free press/speech isn't much good if it isn't exercised. Conversely, having a few specific restrictions on speech isn't necessarily a problem if, in practice, the press and public speech in general isn't adversely affected. 

We can quibble over specific laws if you like, but the overall impression I've gotten of European countries is that they are at least as free as the US in practice.

We'd lose a town or city, that's war, but then the total combined UN forced would eliminate that nation from the map. We'd probably just go straight imperialistic and conquerer the nation and the European nations would all look the other way.

As far as it's people, we'll if they wanted human rights they shouldn't have made unprovoked attacks with nuclear weapons.

I think that's how a real man handles it. You don't live in fear of these things. You walk softly and carry a big stick. So the stance isn't we are going to stick our heads up every nations ass looking for nukes. The stance should be, nuke us and your nation belongs to us and your people can face the next major exodus.

In the long run there is no possible way we can monitor and stop every nation in the world from getting WMD, especially biological weapons which are arguably far more deadly than nukes and thousands of times harder to trace where the payload came from. 

Our only real solution in the future is to stop making enemies because technology will allow WMD creation for any corporations or nation with a few million dollars. You'll be able to literally  make a genetically engineered biological weapon in your basement. ",False,,aeai,True,0,1231134588,[deleted],1,1,0

But without that, they'll never gain western support. The reality is we feel bad for the underdog, but no so much the one that suicide bombs and purposely targets civilians. 

It's sad, and Israel and the US may kill many more people with their large scale wars, which Palestine clearly cannot fight. However, that's still no excuse to target civilians.

Die like a man, charge an armed target and let Israel keep bombing. If the world saw Palestine without it's terrorist tactics, they would like them and they embrace them as the underdog who needs help.

But there is a def rift there. Western nations have agreed upon rules of war because we've fought so many wars and we've used every evil tactic around. Still suicide bombing is beyond even the tactics of WW1 and targeting civilians 
specifically and all the time is embarrassing to the Palestinian cause. 

At some people Palestinians need to get made at the tactics these 'Freedom Fighters' are using because you know damn well their tactics are greatly increasing the odd of civlians deaths on your side. Such as first targeting civilians and then secondly hiding in civilian areas. 

Well if you just didn't target civilians with hit and run tactics and instead die fighting military targets, like real men, most of this wouldn't be happening. 

Sounds condescending, but it's completely true. Land wars happen, we can blame that on human nature. Targeting civilians is just a disgusting and pointless choice than can ONLY possibly perpetuate this conflict endlessly, which is what your 'Freedom Fighters' actually want. Because, without this conflict they've known all their lives, what else would those rebels have? Their lives are literally based around dissent from Israel. 

So, it appears to me neither side wants peace, pretty much at all, at least in no serious protest in the streets style.

Did you see the American protests? We protested the Iraq war left and right, doesn't stop our President because that's the way our government is setup, but our protests were the largest and most frequent of any nation. 

One thing American's didn't do to stop the war is resort to domestic violence. 

So call us what you will, but Israel and Palestine's conflict really has nothing to do with the US nor does the tiny 4 billion a year we give Israel make a huge difference in overall economy. 

So, while making westerns feel guilty is one tactic that might help create pressure against Israel. You do understand that until groups within Palestine stops targeting civilians, such as buses, train stations, bar mitzvahs. Until then the west isn't going to care all that much. Personally I don't blame them. There is no reason to resort to those tactic. Israel is not invading and committing genocide against you. Tell these people in Palestine, targeting of civilians is barbaric and can only ensure the war goes on forever. 

And to what end, will Palestine fly a jumbo get into some Israeli skyscraper or large event and then trigger an all our response, giving Israel the excuse they've been waiting for. AND will western nations care, probably not because you're targeting civilians and we all know masses of Palestinians agree with these tactics.

At the same time the western world will pressure Israel to stop, this time, because it's advances are seen as unjust. If these rebels pull off a large scale attack like 911, western powers will not hold Israel's chain and they will inflict as much devastation as they can while we look the other way. 

Lets face it, Israel hates Palestine. The only real thing stopping them from pushing your people into the sea is the UN and the worlds eye. However terrorist like tactics don't exactly make us revel in guilt or philanthropy.

The big difference isn't how many citizens you kill, it's just the simple fact the goal is specifically to kill masses of random civilians. No real purpose or goals, just kill as many as you can. Even the US at it's worst has never done that. We did firebomb whole German cities and civilians, but it was their industrial center and crippled their war output. And of course we also bombed Japan with nukes, but again that was a rare and special situation with the US fighting a two front war and the first use of nuclear weapons. However, it was an odd target choice I'd say at the least, but it did end the war and allow more focus on Europe and then helping rebuild. But those are real wars, and world wars at that. Not pathetic bickering over the same useless land over and over again. Palestine has it's chance, but in time the world will just become numb to this constant conflict and distance itself from both nations. I would like to see all US or all UN aid cut off to Israel permanently. They don't need out money and every time they go to war they prove that. 

If Palestinian rebels want to attack Israel, why can't they attack real targets? People are expendable and renewable. You can't hurt Israel by killing their civilians. 

Palestine's smartest move is to just take it, don't attack back and in time the UN will move in. The key is not resorting to targeting civilians. ",False,,aep6,True,0,1231136066,[deleted],-17,-17,0

Surprisingly, justice happened.  It should have happened for the slaves in the USA back in the late 1800's, but we torpedoed that.

In any case, your idea that you can ""punish"" a country by declaring a new ""homeland"" for someone else's people - whose permission you don't have either - has four problems.

1.  Its opens up the entire fucking continent to a victim-fest.  Spanish inquisition?  (Muslims would have a case their, too)  Eastern European pograms?  Do you remember the Dreyfuss Affair?  Throughout Europe, Jews would hide every Easter, because Christians would put on Passion Plays, and then go kill them som' Jews.  The Crusades killed a percentage of Jews in Europe unseen until the Inquisition and Holocaust.  Don't even start with the Roma - they don't even *have* a homeland.

2.  Punishing a country out of national vengeance means punishing their descendants.  If you're going to fuck over *anyone* a hundred years from now, ask the victims.

3.  Jewish Nationalism never really ""started"" or ""ended"".  Jews were easy to hate because they were ""apart"" from every political system they lived in.  They refused to be assimilated.  They were a cohesive group identity that has only two factions: Ashkenazi and Sephardic.  Almost all Jews nowadays have some Hebrew blood, thanks to intermarraige, and Jews consider themselves a nation like another other group of people.

What? Are you claiming that from the 1800s and to now the Jews in Israel have killed hundreds of thousands of Palestinians? You very clearly need to give sources to that incredibly outlandish statement.

&gt; Notice how you completely ignored the word occupation.

You do know what the intifada is, right? That is not the occupation, but the uprising against the occupation. So there's nothing to notice, thank you.

&gt; Also notice how you think there is absolutely nothing wrong with killing 10,000 people.

Well, you certainly know how to built straw men and give me opinions that I do not have. If you want an honest debate, then stop subscribing me opinions that I quite clearly do not have and have not even expressed. It's a rather insulting claim at that, too.

&gt; Well you are acting as an apologist for it so obviously you see nothing wrong with it.

What? What makes me an apologist? Are you reading from the fact that I support the right of Israel to exist that it then automatically follows that I have no qualms with the killing of thousand upon thousands of people? You're being incredibly dishonest.

&gt; What better way to punish them by taking their land and giving it to the jews?

If you may have noticed, the European project is not about punishing people because of what happened during the war, but overcoming it. Anyhow, it seems rather impossible to force people to accept a country if they do not want to live there. The project of a Jewish homeland in Germany is entirely infeasible, no matter what punishment you think the Germans need.

&gt; Again arabs are willing to live next to israel despite all the arabs israel has killed and continues to kill even to this day.

Well, I'd certainly say they aren't willing to live next to Israel. You certainly don't sound like you'd be willing to if you were Arab either.

&gt; Israel has been killing arabs for forty years. Did you know that?

The bloody buggers of this conflict have been killing each other for a hundred years, did you know that? The conflict is idiotic, the killings tragic and the whole thing messed up.

Only a few decades earlier Turkey threw out all the ethnic Greeks and Armenians who hadn't been killed already in order to create a more pure Turkey, and these people lost everything and had to start again in a new country...yet they never became a cause like this.

In the context of history, the focus that this one particular cause has received - far larger than genocide in Rwanda and Darfur, far larger than regular genocidal behaviour in Burma - seems incredible.

There's no reason to assume that such things aren't part of the reason for such a huge balance of focus being given to one particular issue. Something's kinda odd there.

There is still a deep wound in Palestinians and loathing from the surounding Arab states that is fueling this whole thing and Israel's refusal to acknowledge this is what keeps it going. 

Ultimately, the deed is done and the key to a solution is for Israel to accept and stop their refusal of having Hamas at the negotiating table.

Many redditors have made up their mind, then fight tirelessly for their side, refusing to listen to new evidence when it becomes available.

I agree to a point, and yes, there is usually a prevailing 'opinion' that tends to dominate major issues on reddit.  While there are those that will bash needlessly, I think on the whole it's too simplistic to paint people as simply criticizing shared religion or other groups simply because that's what they are.

While it might seem like that sometimes, I think that the majority of people still maintain the intent to attack what they see as 'wrong' or 'destructive' behavior.

Scientology isn't attacked simply because it's an unorthodox 'religion' - it's attacked because it's a religious front for a commercial organization designed to extract money from people.  There's enough evidence to support the fact that the entire thing was fabricated by Hubbard (and continued by characters such as Miscaviage) as a business venture, to sink a battleship.

Likewise, people (although it did get a bit extreme) largely attacked republicans during the last election for dragging American politics to new lows that had never been seen before.  The bracketing of Obama as a muslim, a man with terrorist connections, anti-American, friend to religious nutters.  All this deserves utter contempt because it's insulting to the intelligence of American voters.  To actually describe someone who is a democratically elected Senator of the United States as a person who ""hates America"" is beyond childish.  It's morally bankrupt.

As for anti-Israel stories, well you tell me.  Who's dying out there?  I don't see many headlines reporting that another 100 Israelis, including innocent civilians, have lost their lives. European leaders have called for it to stop.  Fairly restrained people like Ban Ki Moon (head of the UN) have called for it to stop - he's a former Korean minister who refused to meet Hamas when he visited the middle east recently - what possible reason would he have for being anti-Israel?  He's just calling for what he thinks is the right solution.

Yes, grouping people is dangerous.  As a resident of Japan, I *frequently* get involved in fairly heated arguments with people who make statements like ""The Japanese are racist"" because it groups the entire nation under one category which is just wrong.  In fact I had a huge humdinger of an argument utterly refuting this kind of behaviour only within the last couple of weeks.  You're right in principle, but I think that each case needs to be taken on its merits - what are the facts here?  Who is doing what to whom?  Then make your judgement.  If Scientology, the Republicans or Israel are doing something good, then there's nothing to talk about.

However, at some point of evolved civility violent uprising is reserved only as the last resort and this certainly is not it. 

You are letting the same emotion that makes police violent guide your judgment. You are intolerant to their corruption and you want to solve it through violence. 

A smarter solution would be something like what kopbusters did. You can bust cops on your own. Get some cameras and mics in your car and stream them to a secure internet server... perhaps a nice offshore VPS or just anywhere because local cops aren't powerful outside of their own state.

Plus you can then sue and make thousands of dollars. Just go look suspicious and then have a little attitude with the cop and he'll probably overstep his bounds and you'll have it in tape.

The Internet is; that's what ad-blockers are for.  It's also a symptom of an economic system that has exceeded any natural capacity to absorb additional products.

I never understood the Krispy-Kreme IPO.  What's the long term cash flow potential of that business model?  Food profit margins always suck.  There are only 3 (maybe 4 or 5 for some) meals in a day, 365 days in a year, 400M people in the US.  And you certainly aren't going to have every person eating KK at every meal of the year - it's not Demolition Man &amp; Taco Bell.  Run the numbers and you can't grow for very long - yet that's what required.

And of course all the constant advertising is fatiguing.  Like food consumption, humans have a finite amount of attention per unit time.  They have a finite amount of disposable time per year.   

Clearly attention is a resource no different than money or physical or virtual.  Ergo, attention is a finite personal resource that is literally stolen by advertising.   What they are doing is no less theft than downloading IP or stealing your wallet.  Getting constantly mugged for your wallet is fatiguing also.

Advertisers in broadcast media long ago over-saturated and over-stayed their welcome in our attentions.  They don't seem to get this - you kill the golden goose eventually even if you boil the frog slowly (how's that for mixed metaphors).

This is why people are actively seeking substitutes such as Tivo, bit-torrenting stuff, MP3 players, the web, no watching or listening to MSM broadcast radio or TV, etc., etc.  When it comes to basic threats, what is a licit or illicit substitute becomes irrelevant to relieving the pain or threat.  

This is also why black markets and white markets aren't really any different except by virtue of artificial construct of law - remember law is responsible for legislating pi to be 3, so concern about reality is always secondary for the law.  It's also the law that allows the ""first blood"" theft of us, so it deserves little respect.

Cities have long been sources for intrusive adverting and can be just as fatiguing.  Somewhere there was I guy who Photoshopped or literal covered every commercial sign in a city in Europe.  The impact of incredible.  

I'm not sure if nature is automatically better but it's certainly evolutionarily ""normal"" in terms of stimulus.   Certain specific forms maybe better than others but compared to the assault of modern advertisers, anything is marginally better.

For example, why do we like nicely trimmed lawns?  Maybe because savannah grasslands that were well-trimmed by migrating herds and which had only a few solitary trees couldn't hide predators so we evolved a connection to our dopamine pleasure center from seeing ""safe"" environments so we would seek them out.

When I first went to Europe it felt very different just to look at while traveling by train.  It felt more calming and clean.  I finally realized that it was because most towns in Germany and the Benelux have power lines below ground.

Of course genetics play a role in those things, that's a given, genetics plays a role in *everything* we do and are, but it tells us nothing about a person's dietary habits.

America's obesity problem (I assume that you acknowledge that the US has one), and any other nation's obesity problem, is *not* down to genetics. Neither is it down to the ""prejudices"" of ""bigots"" redefining what body type, weight or mass is healthy. America's obesity problem is down to what Americans eat and how much of it they eat.

If obesity were principally down to genetics, then Europeans would be suffering from it too, but they are not, at least, not to anything like the same degree (although the UK is doing its best to follow the US example). The Germans eat very heartily, but they have nothing like the obesity problem that the US has, the French famously love their food and drink, but you don't see many Vito Spatafores or Bobby ""Bacala"" Baccalieris in Paris (or elsewhere in the country). Ditto the Scandanavians. 

None of this is bigotry or prejudice. The US has developed a particular nutritional culture, that culture has produced the results we see today. Getting angry with others for pointing out the obvious, claiming that existing standards need to be overhauled because so many US citizens now fall foul of them isn't going to cut much ice outside of the US, and it's clear that it doesn't cut much ice with a large swathe of the US population. 

Your claim that genetics is behind the obesity problems in the US is palpably wrong, and like many, I suspect that much of that thinking at least, is propagated by the food industry itself, attempting to justify its role in the poisoning and partial disablement of many millions of US citizens.

&gt;Ultimately, the situation was difficult to begin with. Israel was not created under peaceful terms. In fact, it was created by rather ruthlessly taking over land and fighting with their neighbors to expand their land, which ultimately set the stage for this gorilla war that is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict we see today: kinda like a shotgun wedding. There is still a deep wound in Palestinians and loathing from the surounding Arab states that is fueling this whole thing and Israel's refusal to acknowledge this is what keeps it going.

Well, that unfortunately misses some of the context from the time, such as the role of Nazi propaganda in building up anti-Jewish sentiment and the idea of getting rid of them from the middle east too.

It also gets far more focus from the UN than have other human tragedies such as Burma. The difference in the count of resolutions against Israel vs Burma is huge. And yet, statistically speaking, the tragedy befalling Burmese has been much larger. 

I've heard many left-leaning people bemoan the lack of coverage for tragedies in other countries compared to local events, sure. Hence the Onion's headline along the lines of '50,000 brown people die in a country somewhere'. 

One just has to wonder why the Israel issue in particular became so huge. Especially given the Turkey one didn't, yet they weren't too far apart in time. They were both similar...

And as I noted, is it merely coincidence that most of Europe disliked Jews at one time or other (many countries expelled them), as did Arab countries (accelerated in part thanks to Nazi propaganda)...? I have no idea, but it's been interesting reading recently how Nazi propaganda affected Arab sentiment toward Jews...

Not only that, but why did the surrounding Arab countries drive their Jews out and take their land - around four times the amount of land in Israel - yet since then don't want them to live in Israel either?

Well, maybe that's partially true, but you can't claim it's universal among the Jewish population of Israel. There's also a lot of Eastern European DNA among those who emmigrated from Europe. That doesn't mean there's no justification for Israel's existance - there is - it's just that the DNA part is not quite as ironclad as you say.


&gt;We got that land because it's our homeland and we'd been building it up for 70 years, not because the Europeans felt guilty.


Again it's not as simple as you imply. You leave out that the percentage of Jewish people in Palestine not that long before the war (1922) was significantly less than 10% (according to census figures provided by the UN). Moslems were by far the majority, with even the Christian population being larger than the Jewish one. And the Jewish population of the area had been fairly miniscule ever since the time of the destruction of the Second Temple in the first century A.D. - you have to admit, that's a very long time. At the time Israel was created, the large population of Jews was still a fairly new phenomenon in the region.

Further, you leave out the really inconvenient part: that the *Palestinians and **their** ancestors* had been living in the land in the interim. That's nearly 2000 years, far longer than the biblical nation of Israel, upon which you base most of your claims, existed. It appears to me that Israel and it's supporters have convinced the world that the only valid criteria for deciding the conflict is ""who was there first,"" but there's no reason why ""who was there longest"" or ""who was there most recently"" or ""who was there in the greatest numbers"" are not also legitimate criteria, and those are criteria that can result in a different answer.

Also - let's not fool ourselves - there *was* some guilt involved in the United Nation's decisions and earlier ones made by Britian and the U.S. That's not the only reason for Israel's existance, but it did play a part.

Still, in my view, Israel within the pre-67 borders has long been a fait accompli. If Israel would be content with only that much land - far more than the original state of Israel contained - peace would have a chance.

It's really not our fight, has nothing to do with it, we can't stop it peacefully. It's been happening since Roman times one way or another for the Jews. 

Why is EVERYTHING America's fault and problem ? 

The rest of the world needs to man up a little. Europe wanted Israel created much more than the US, mostly because they didn't want them 'damned jews' immigrating into their lands. 

I think America minded immigrating Jews the least, but then again since we had an ocean between us we probably only got the richest jews :P Man it's good to not be connected to asia. 

Yea the US gives Israel about 4 billion a year sometimes more sometimes less, but that's not enough to run a nation or military. 

More importantly if we didn't give Israel 4 billion a year, they'd still be able to beat the living hell out of Palestine, just for fun, while economically trumping them by many times.

In other words, Palestine can't beat Israel even with us aiding them as we do Israel and pulling aid from Israel. Israel has it's own economy and well trained military. I'm sure the US has helped them out, but we don't control them nor is aid somehow the tipping point in this conflict. 

All that has to happen for Palestine to get full western support is for their fighters to stop targeting civilians and ideally stop suicide bombing. 

Do that and westerns can associate with you. If you don't you're like the next thing down from the Nazi's in our minds. 

I know, we kill lots of civilians, but we don't target them specifically trying to kill as many as possible. That mentality is not something the west will ever be interested in getting along with or accepting. That's what makes American's want to go wipe Islamic nations and not really give a damn. 

Sure, you can't fight a modern war. But, cmon attack armed targets. That mentality is also why in general America fear the idea of any Islamic state getting nukes. But certainly Iran and Palestine are completely different. 

Still, targeting civilians is like using chemical weapons or biological weapons. It's the bottom of the barrel of morals. And sadly Palestinian 'freedom fighters' are doing for what, a land war. It's not as if theirs backs are against the wall and Israel is wiping the Palestinians from the earth and so they resort to suicide bombing and attacks on civilians. 

No, they just do it for fun.. yaaa haw. Lets fight and endless war. They like it. Both sides likes having this endless conflict.   It's exciting, it's something to blame all your troubles on, it's proof of your nationalism. 

I say, let them go at it. The higher oil goes the sooner we'll be out of the middle east forever. Plus WTF can we really do to stop these two. Like Israel really just attacks unprovoked. Of course they are getting wailed on with missiles. Maybe not actually doing much damage to Israel, but it scares them and makes them want to retaliate and they more than have the means.

Palestine knows it's poking the fucking hungry lion and does it anyway. So, I feel sorry for the underdog, but I could care less who's land is who's or if they fight it out forever. It's both their people's responsibility to end the violence, not ours.

It's not like Israel asked Bush and the American people if it was ok for them to attack Palestine for awhile. All we can do is deny them aid and most politicians want the jewish vote a lot more than the Palestinian. Sad, but true. 

More importantly, denying them aid would change things just a little bit less than absolutely nothing.

There are a number of causes/items of note.

* Satisfaction with a lower productivity.

* Lack of ethnic and cultural diversity leads to simplified bureaucratic burden.

* Similarly, bureaucratic burden increases with the size and distribution of the population.

* Socialism has been implemented ""with a braod stroke"" twice.  In China and in Russia.  Russia's economy exsanguinated itself. China has switched to a fascist economic model.

* Europe, on the other hand, is comprised of several ethnographically insular, geographically miniscule nations -- none of which are also required to carry the burden of their own militarized defense (the entirety of Europe has been ""riding on the coat-tails"" of the Pax Americana, for good or ill.)  Despite this, Germany and France are set -- for varying reasons -- to face the imminent collapse of their economies.  

* Europe in general is handling the economic collapse **vastly** less readily than is America.

&gt; Are other countries filled with better, more educated people?

There are more highly educated individuals with American college doctorates than any other nation's.  That being said, we also tend to have a higher problem with semi- and pseudo- literacy than just about any other modernized nation.  This despite a reliably higher per-capita spending pattern than most other nations.  Education isn't the problem -- it's part of the symptom.

&gt; Or do they just have better regulations and rules governing their democracy?

I will freely concede that the Parliamentary system is likely better than the Presidential.  At the very least, it discourages the ""Winner-Take-All"" system we're stuck with.

Israel provoked the rise of extremism in Gaza (starving them made Hamas even more pppular, they aknowledged this but did nothing), 60 years and Peace talks didn't progress, nothing changed for Palestinians, except few settlers removed just to give the impression that there's progress, Israel succeded not in Peace, just in propaganda, that they did achieve perfectly

and the only argument zionists use is ""what would do another country if they were attacked?"" to that i say Israel is still occupying Palestine which doesn't make them a country yet but an occupying force.

The fact that ""full-blown COMMUNISM, you dumb fuck"" has completely failed in the two instances it has been tried is only corollary proof that socialism requires other things additively in order to endure: in other words -- it doesn't work.

&gt; Wait, so your only two examples of Socialism are extreme communist implementation?

Aside from the entirety of Europe which was the primary thrust of my comment?  Yup.  You got me. Guilty as charged.

&gt; So what you're trying to say, is that the concept of real ""socialist"" programs and principles elude you? 

By no means.  This should be clear from the fact that I directly referred to the economic model of the US as 'fascist'.

&gt; Health Care, real Social and Employment Assistance, drug clinics and homeless aid; to name a few things that are working for other countries, REALLY FUCKING WELL I might add.

I refer you to my previous comment.  Then, consider: Germany's healthcare system is losing doctors; and the average age of said doctors is increasing at a much faster rate than is that of the general population's average age.  France's medical system is quite literally hemorraghing funds... and that is **with** the dual-system where individuals are allowed to both pay for the socialized system *and* buy their own care on top of that.  The UK, AU, and NZ systems have wait periods that are downright monstrous in many cases -- and they use several obfuscation tricks to try to conceal this like deferring the wait to the ""pre-registration"" period.  There's a ***reason*** why you're roughly twice as likely to survive cancer as a US citizen as you are as a EU citizen.

Drug clinics are, similarly, very easy to come by when you displace all the costs of research onto foreign nationals.  Which is exactly what the socialized systems have been doing with the threat of nationalized formulas.

Meanwhile, us here in the US have to face the continued and advancing Corporatization of our economy -- something I have ranted and railed against time and time again.

&gt; Stop listening to the bullshit on TV and think for yourselves, most Americans haven't the slightest clue about how badly they're fucking themselves.

The last time I got my information from the TV, or from the mainstream media, even, I was twelve years old.  It's been a very long time since that was the case.

&gt; The ""government"" parties and big businesses are simply taking advantage of your natural ignorance and stupidity.

I reiterate: America's economy has been turning fascist since 1886.

&gt; It is all your fault.

I beg to differ.

None of this changes, however, the simple fact that socialism as a mechanism ***isn't*** working well for those nations which have implemented it.  This is masked by their radically reduced HFoG signature.

Back then (just like now), the economic situation in Palestine was very bad compared to the US, and only the die hard zionists were willing to make this choice.

Don't fool yourself with the nonsense Israeli propaganda of overwhelming force.   Overwhelming force is when you  bring so much force that either your opponent is not able to react, or if he does resist then there is small localize damage.  This is what happens when Police decides to arrest a difficult person.  They bring lot of officers to over power the subject,  that is not exactly the same as beating you to a  pulp each time they pull you over.  

Israel is bringing in overwhelming destruction, hoping for the shock and awe that many idiots before them tried.   For a historical parallel..... If you can see any difference between what is happening in Gaza today and what happened in these pictures, I like to know.

&gt; Jews were barred from the Western Wall at least part of the time Jordan had control.

The best you can come up with is that in some period in history Jews were not allowed to go to this wall?

For your information, prior to World War I there was no Jordan.  Jordan, like Israel is a legacy of British and French colonialism in middle east.    British recognized the importance of Middle East they applied divide and conquer tactic.   

Furhtermore, Do you realize that for most part Mosque is off limit to Palestinians?   

What is worst is that Palestinians can't even  go from village to a village, or even go to sea to catch a fish, people die in Isreali check points on the way to  hospitals.... There is not even basic daily life without constant harassments from Israeli army, or the Zionist terrorist (aka settlers).     It seems that the only connection Palestinians have to the Mosque is a picture they hand from their rooms.

Did Jews ever lived in the middle east like how Zionist have forced the Palestinians to  live?

You are right, I am bigot toward all form of hateful ideology.   


&gt; by not calling for the immediate destruction of the state of Israel, I must therefore don't think it's that big of a deal.

&gt; But it saddens me that your absolutes are so rigid, 

I think any one with any sense of humanity should call and end to the ideology that is governing Israel.  Is that rigid?    As you said , in my opinion, Israel's action is on par with Nazis,  I would expect every Jewish person to applaud my rigidity in that there are people like myself (many of them indeed are Jewish)  that wont just look the other way.     Didn't WW II teach us that we should not be silent?    People died in the concentration camps because most people were not rigid.  Too many people were looking for ""shades of meaning""  while atrocities were being committed.

The real roots were Christian/Judaism clashes, and the fact that a lot of Jews (and Jewish culture) promoted a sort of cultural isolationism and avoidance of intermarriage and the like, which didn't lend itself well to eventual integration.

The Holocaust showed up because Germany was:

* experiencing a lot of class issues due to the fallout from the collapse of the aristocracy and the ever-increasing rise of the professional class

* was clobbered by the Great Depression.  It hadn't had a great economy since WWI, but the Great Depression drove unemployment up to 30% and saw desperation around the country.  Combine that with the fact that Jews (disproportionately represented in the professional class) were doing relatively well and the rise of hard-right nationalism as a way to shake off the humiliation of the Treaty of Versailles, and you've got an explosive mix.

Also, remember that the Holocaust *wasn't* what the Nazis originally wanted to do.  They came to power based on dislike of the French and the Versailles-imposed penalties (loss of the Rhineland, crippling war debt payments) and culture and class-driven dislike of Jews.  The [Madagascar Plan](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Madagascar_plan), the original intent, was to exile Jews (and take their land and property, which would help fuel the war economy).  Unfortunately, France (which didn't really want Jews much more than Germany did) and claimed Madagascar, told Germany to shove off.  Once World War II started, Germany (which was relatively weak from a naval standpoint), there was no real chance to go ahead with the Madagascar Plan, and hence the [Final Solution](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Final_Solution) came into being.

Zionism in the post-World War II Europe was just a good fit for most parties.  It solved the problem of huge numbers of Jewish refugees that Germany definitely didn't want, Europe didn't want, and the US didn't want in at least the sort of numbers that they were showing up in.  It made Jewish nationalists estatic -- they could establish a Jewish-dominant state.  The need for numbers to establish control over the lands would cause pushes to get Jews to immigrate to Israel from around the world, making various other nations with anti-semetic sentiment (France, Russia, etc) quite happy.

The only people who weren't enthralled were the Palestinians.  They'd lived side-by-side with Jews for thousands of years, and the initial small settlements were okay, but having the sum total of Europe and Asia's Jewish population dumped on top of them (and actually outnumbering them) was a bit much to bear, especially when they'd had nothing to do with the things producing the refugees and the countries who had were unwilling to do much themselves to resolve the refugee issue.

You might as well post a sign at the airport entrance saying ""Only people wearing red hats will be searched."" 

Taking the assumption that all terrorists are Muslim (for the sake of argument), it's not ""racial"" profiling, it's religious profiling. You can't do religious profiling at a checkpoint, because it's not something you can spot easily. It's like gay profiling. You have to rely on either signals or the honesty of the person, and a Muslim terrorist trying to get through a checkpoint isn't going to be wearing a keffiyeh and a two-foot long beard. There are all kinds of Muslims, they're not all dark brown with long beards. There are black African muslims, Eastern Asian muslims, and yes, European muslims who look just like everyday White Joe American. Racial profiling is just going to make it that much easier to sneak through these people. 

This may have worked when al-Qaeda was a small group completely made of Saudi arabs, but our wildly successful effort after 9/11 to completely piss off the entire Muslim world has put the idea into  Muslim heads from every continent that America can, will, and must be defeated. 

Of course, it's put the idea into plenty of non-Muslim heads as well. There IS one valid reason to consider Muslims as a separate case - their strong faith in an afterlife. If you compare that to a McVeigh-style domestic terrorist, they are going to try to not be there when the bomb goes off. This prevents them from engaging in suicide attacks, which are much easier to do. 

The one good thing is that Americans are so fearful. I said right after 9/11 that there wouldn't be another attack by Muslims for a long time. It's sort of like vowing revenge on someone, but not carrying it out - they're always looking over their shoulder, never knowing when the next one will be. Unfortunately, that means all this security nonsense is working, albeit indirectly - the root word of ""terrorism"" is of course ""terror"" - when Americans stop acting terrified, they'll know we need another dose. Until then, they can just hang out, building resources, and watching us squirm. 

The most effective thing the government is doing to prevent another terrorist attack is actually keeping everyone scared. All the security measures in the world will never stop a wave of determined terrorists. However, the constant blanket of fear it creates by serving as an in-your-face reminder makes further efforts on their end somewhat unnecessary. ",True,,b9mz,True,0,1231248482,senatorpjt,3,3,0

Khalid Mish'al is the head of the Hamas political bureau:

For 18 months my people in Gaza have been under siege, incarcerated inside the world's biggest prison, sealed off from land, air and sea, caged and starved, denied even medication for our sick. After the slow death policy came the bombardment. In this most densely populated of places, nothing has been spared Israel's warplanes, from government buildings to homes, mosques, hospitals, schools and markets. More than 540 have been killed and thousands permanently maimed. A third are women and children. Whole families have been massacred, some while they slept.

This river of blood is being shed under lies and false pretexts. For six months we in Hamas observed the ceasefire. Israel broke it repeatedly from the start. Israel was required to open crossings to Gaza, and extend the truce to the West Bank. It proceeded to tighten its deadly siege of Gaza, repeatedly cutting electricity and water supplies. The collective punishment did not halt, but accelerated - as did the assassinations and killings. Thirty Gazans were killed by Israeli fire and hundreds of patients died as a direct effect of the siege during the so-called ceasefire. Israel enjoyed a period of calm. Our people did not.

When this broken truce neared its end, we expressed our readiness for a new comprehensive truce in return for lifting the blockade and opening all Gaza border crossings, including Rafah. Our calls fell on deaf ears. Yet still we would be willing to begin a new truce on these terms following the complete withdrawal of the invading forces from Gaza.

No rockets have ever been fired from the West Bank. But 50 died and hundreds more were injured there last year at Israel's hands, while its expansionism proceeded relentlessly. We are meant to be content with shrinking scraps of territory, a handful of cantons at Israel's mercy, enclosed by it from all sides.The truth is Israel seeks a one-sided ceasefire, observed by my people alone, in return for siege, starvation, bombardment, assassinations, incursions and colonial settlement. What Israel wants is a gratuitous ceasefire.

The logic of those who demand that we stop our resistance is absurd. They absolve the aggressor and occupier - armed with the deadliest weapons of death and destruction - of responsibility, while blaming the victim, prisoner and occupied. Our modest, home-made rockets are our cry of protest to the world. Israel and its American and European sponsors want us to be killed in silence. But die in silence we will not.

What is being visited on Gaza today was visited on Yasser Arafat before. When he refused to bow to Israel's dictates, he was imprisoned in his Ramallah headquarters, surrounded by tanks for two years. When this failed to break his resolve, he was murdered by poisoning.

Gaza enters 2009 just as it did 2008: under Israeli fire. Between January and February of last year 140 Gazans died in air strikes. And just before it embarked on its failed military assault on Lebanon in July 2006, Israel rained thousands of shells on Gaza, killing 240. From Deir Yassin in 1948 to Gaza today, the list of Israel's crimes is long. The justifications change, but the reality is the same: colonial occupation, oppression, and never-ending injustice. If this is the ""free world"" whose ""values"" Israel is defending, as its foreign minister Tzipi Livni alleges, then we want nothing to do with it.

Israel's leaders remain in the grip of confusion, unable to set clear goals for the attacks - from ousting the legitimately elected Hamas government and destroying its infrastructure, to stopping the rockets. As they fail to break Gaza's resistance the benchmark has been lowered. Now they speak of weakening Hamas and limiting the resistance. But they will achieve neither. Gaza's people are more united than ever, determined not to be terrorised into submission. Our fighters, armed with the justice of their cause, have already caused many casualties among the occupation army and will fight on to defend their land and people. Nothing can defeat our will to be free.

Once again, Washington and Europe have opted to aid and abet the jailer, occupier and aggressor, and to condemn its victims. We hoped Barack Obama would break with George Bush's disastrous legacy but his start is not encouraging. While he swiftly moved to denounce the Mumbai attacks, he remains tongue-tied after 10 days of slaughter in Gaza. But my people are not alone. Millions of freedom-loving men and women stand by its struggle for justice and liberation - witness daily protests against Israeli aggression, not only in the Arab and Islamic region, but worldwide.

Israel will no doubt wreak untold destruction, death and suffering in Gaza. But it will meet the same fate in Gaza as it did in Lebanon. We will not be broken by siege and bombardment, and will never surrender to occupation.

That was Dec 30th.  It's been paid.

&gt;I'm certain the fines for late payments were on the contract they signed. 

Untrue, the fines are based on a contractual even which has not occurred - Ukraine owes no fines.

&gt;It can be reduced to a difference of outlook: Do you expect oil prices to rise to $60 a barrel this year, or to drop back down to between $30 and $40 a barrel? (Oil has surged in the last two trading days to about $46 a barrel because of the fighting in Gaza.)

&gt;In Europe, natural gas prices follow oil, and Russia is clearly of the consensus view that oil will average somewhere in the neighborhood of $60 a barrel this year. That corresponds to a natural gas price of about $350 per 1,000 cubic meters. (Here’s the loose formula to get the natural gas price: divide the oil price by six, then multiply the result by 35.3).

&gt;Hence the claim by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin that the demand by Gazprom, Russia’s natural gas behemoth, for $250 per 1,000 cubic meters from Ukraine this year amounts to a “humanitarian gesture.”

&gt;Ukraine, however, has embraced oil’s most recent price band. It’s arguing that oil will average $40 a barrel this year, or $235 per 1,000 cubic meters of natural gas. That’s precisely what Ukraine has counter-offered to Gazprom.

&gt;(As a separate matter, if Europe truly is paying $500 per 1,000 cubic meters, as Gazprom has claimed, it is seriously overpaying. That corresponds to $84-a-barrel oil.)

&gt;(Another baffling issue is Russia’s claim that it’s owed a $600 million late fee on top of the $1.5 billion natural gas bill that Ukraine already has paid. That’s a 40% penalty, and Ukraine is only a month late.)

&gt;The subtext is the nature of the two countries’ contract, which is based not on the spot price of natural gas, or a forecast, but a formula that lags current prices by eight months. In other words, when Gazprom is retorting that it in fact could charge Ukraine $418 per 1,000 cubic meters if it so wishes, that’s Russia’s estimate of the price of natural gas last May.

http://www.businessweek.com/blogs/russia_oil_politics/archives/2009/01/russia-ukraine.html

Unless you are a Russian agent, you know this is political payback for Ukraine daring to talk back to Russia this past summer over the Georgia war.

Don't be naive here - Russia isn't the good guy in this.

EDIT: Also, nymex spot gas is $215 per 1000cm, so please do tell me why Russia feels $400 is the 'market price'.

We implore and beseech our Jewish brethren to realize that the Zionists are not the saviors of the Jewish People and guarantors of their safety, but rather the instigators and original cause of Jewish suffering in the Holy Land and worldwide. The idea that Zionism and the State of ""Israel"" is the protector of Jews is probably the greatest hoax ever perpetuated on the Jewish people... It has been the age-old intention of Zionism to intentionally stir up anti-semitism anywhere possible, and even more commonly, to take advantage of any Jewish suffering anywhere in order to enhance its cause.

The small dead bodies were laid next to one another on the tiled floor of the morgue corridor, the blood drained from their cheeks. One had a bandage still wrapped around his head, another lay with his mouth half-open in his oversized, bloodstained clothes.

For a week the Samouni family had taken shelter in their small, single-storey home in Zeitoun, south-east of Gaza City, and there they survived wave after wave of Israeli bombing and artillery strikes. Then came Israel's ground offensive, the next phase in what Israel argues is a necessary and justified battle against the Palestinian militants firing rockets out of Gaza.

The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, promised an ""iron fist"" for Hamas and said he would treat the civilian citizens of Gaza with ""silk gloves,"" though the Palestinians of Gaza know perhaps better than most that there are few silk gloves in war.

The Samouni family woke on Sunday morning to find themselves surrounded by camouflaged Israeli troops and dozens of tanks, who had set up a position in the rubble of what was once the large Jewish settlement of Netzarim. As dawn broke, the soldiers seized control of the highest buildings in the district and ordered several of the neighbours into the Samouni family home and there a dozen of them waited, without food and without water.

""All day Sunday there was shooting and bombing. We didn't have anything to eat, we didn't have water to drink - our water tanks had been damaged in the fighting,"" said Wael Samouni, 32, who on a normal day would be manning his stall at the vegetable market. ""We couldn't sleep.""

He stepped out of the house briefly and saw a man shooting an M16 assault rifle. He mistook him for a Palestinian militant. Samouni shouted at him: ""Please don't come here. They'll kill us. Go away."" But as the gunman turned round, it became clear he was an Israeli soldier. The soldier shouted back in Arabic: ""Bring me your ID."" Samouni disappeared back into his house and decided not to venture out again.

They passed another night under the bombing and artillery strikes, grateful to have made it through to morning. Samouni remembered sitting in the crowded living room yesterday, surrounded by his neighbours, wondering how much longer they had to endure. It was 6.30am.

""We were sitting and suddenly there was bombing on our house and everyone started to run. There were three rockets. I have no idea where they came from,"" said Samouni. The rockets, believed now to be tank shells, hit the building and brought it crashing down. ""I looked to my side, took hold of my boy Mohammad and I started to run. As I ran I looked back and saw on the floor my mother, two cousins and three of my children. All dead,"" he said. Samouni and the others ran from the house, some raised white cloths as flags and they made it to a patch of safe ground where they were taken to hospital by car.

Yesterday, as three of his children were laid out dead on the hospital floor, Samouni was in a bed upstairs in the Shifa hospital, recovering from wounds to his legs and shoulder and comforting his son Mohammad, five, who had suffered a broken arm in the shelling and had just woken after his operation. He was still unsure exactly how many of his 10 children had died.

""It's a massacre,"" Samouni said. ""I'm 32 years old and I've never seen such things as this. I couldn't help myself or any of those around me. We just want to live in peace.""

At his bedside was his brother Nael, 36, who lives in a house close by. His wife and daughter had been in Wael's house yesterday morning at the time of the shelling: both were killed.

""I wanted to go and join them the night before, but it was too dangerous to go out. If anyone moved he would be shot,"" Nael said. ""Then when I heard the bombing this morning I saw people running. I saw an injured man fall to the ground. I ran to help, but there was an Israeli sniper in the house next door who shouted: 'Leave him alone.' We couldn't rescue anyone.""

As he ran, Israeli troops fired over their heads and then ordered them to lift up their shirts to show they carried no weapons under their clothes. ""We just made it out and here to the hospital,"" Nael said. Then, in a moment of anger, he pointed the blame. ""Hamas is responsible for this. They are starving us, now they are killing us,"" he said. ""They asked the Israelis to enter but where is the resistance? They are hiding. All the leaders of Hamas are underground. It's just the civilians confronting the Israeli army. I don't like Hamas and I don't want them ruling Gaza.""

Hospital officials believe nine people were killed in the Samouni house, including at least four children. But they were not the only civilians to die at the hand of the Israeli offensive yesterday. Just north of Gaza City in the Shamali district, a missile struck a three-storey apartment block in the middle of the night - home to three brothers, their families and their father. It hit the roof and dropped down to the basement, destroying half the building and killing Amer Abu Asha, 47, along with his two wives, three sons and one daughter.

Yesterday his brother Samer Abu Asha, 50, sat outside on a plastic chair under a green awning. Neighbours came to shake his hand and offer their sympathy before slipping away quickly to avoid the next missile strike.

The family were not asleep at 1.30am yesterday when the Israeli missile struck - the noise of the bombing had been too much. In the moments after the attack there was such confusion no one knew who or how many had died.

""We started searching but it was hard with the dust, the darkness and the smoke,"" said Abu Asha. Neighbours told them bodies had been taken to the hospital, so they rushed to the Shifa in Gaza City, only to be told no one from their family had been admitted. ""We went back home and searched everywhere,"" he said. Finally they found his brother Amer lying on a patch of ground outside the house, mortally wounded, his stomach ripped open. ""We started to search for others under the rubble. We found arms, legs, half a head,"" he said. ""We didn't find a complete body.""

Abu Asha admitted that another brother in the family - but one who did not live in the building - was in the Hamas military wing but said he could not account for the bombing. They had received no warning. ""It's unjust. They are targeting civilians, children, old women,"" he said. ""Some European and Arab countries are supporting Israel in this terrorism. They want to crack down on Hamas, but Hamas is not in the houses. It's on the front line. Go there and kill them. Not us.""",True,,bjbx,True,0,1231272709,Boab1917,1,1,0

And we can't forget they've been under an occupation that's gone on for over 4 decades now. I deplore the violence, but need to ask the question once again: What can Israel reasonably expect when it occupies another people? Should the Palestinians simply give up on their dreams for freedom because they're not convenient for Israel? And don't tell me it's because of Palestinian violence, because I know you're familiar enough with the situation to realize that the Palestinians did not resort to violence in any major way in the early years of Occupation.

I think these approaches make sense:
*Professor Bernard Avashai at TPM Cafe:*
&gt;The point is, the rise of Hamas is a cautionary tale about trying to do quickly with military force what needs to be done over a generation with reciprocity. All along, Israel might have made a strong statement of a different kind. It might have endorsed the obvious features a two-state solution, like the ones worked out with President Clinton just before he left office in 2001. It might have helped strengthen the Palestinians' immunity to Hamas ideology, creating a stronger civil society, new businesses, new schools, new Palestinian cooperation with international peace-keepers and investors.

&gt;Israel might have meanwhile announced, say, that it can know the precise location from which each Hamas missile is launched, and that it would bomb that location exactly ten minutes after each launch, giving surrounding citizens a chance to flee--and creating a mounting incentive for civilians to resist Hamas cadres using their homes as cover. One can think of any number of creative ideas that project strength, decency, and hope. This is not, well, rocket science.
http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/01/06/rocket_science/#more

Here's another article that, while perhaps not offering ways to stop Hamas, puts the situation in a larger framework:
*Steve Clemons at the Washington Note:*
&gt;I told him that in my view America's increasingly consequential failures to generate stability in the Middle East is like an eroding levee in New Orleans -- and those levees at some point are going to fail leaving Israel quite vulnerable unless Israel and other stakeholding neighbors achieve a different equilibrium in the region. . .and soon. There is great doubt around the world in the ability of America to pursue and achieve its objectives -- and this doubt has consequences for Israel's national security calculus, whether it is acknowledging it or not.

&gt;...But as Brzezinski said, the Israelis and Palestinians have proven unable to rise to a level of strategic, forward-looking maturity to solve this problem and others now need to stabilize the situation, engage in a credible peace negotiation process that involves the other major Arab stakeholders, the US and Europe.
http://www.thewashingtonnote.com/archives/2009/01/watching_death/

And this may be the best of the three articles:
*Daniel Levy at TPM Cafe:*
&gt;In this respect it is reminiscent of the dynamic in Lebanon in 2006 where it took 33 days to get a U.N. Security Council Resolution (1701) and an end to violence. This time on day 10, things may, in some short-term respects, look good for Israel but this is unlikely to be the case by day 33.  An America that again sits on the sidelines and does not help work towards an urgent ceasefire is doing Israel no favors. 

&gt;So what needs to happen next? The elements for a ceasefire are known - ending the rocket strikes, violence and military incursions in a sustainable way, ending the blockade on Gaza, preventing new arms from entering Gaza and international monitoring for these arrangements/border crossings -- now they need to be stitched together.  For that to work, Hamas needs to be a party to the ceasefire arrangements.  The alternatives - ongoing Israeli occupation, Israel handing control to the PA or international/Arab forces are either highly unrealistic or highly undesirable and dangerous.  However, if Israel does get tempted to go for regime change and removing Hamas then these become the only options that are left, and Gaza will descend into the kind of lawless chaos which is a gift to al-Qaeda style Salafists and will create a Somalia on its doorstep.

The latter article is especially good and offers some good rebuttals to many of the claims I've seen being made here at reddit.

You:
&gt;How about, the people who lived where what is now Israel?

How about them? They are now called Palestinians, but there was no group that called themselves that in 1948. The notion that they somehow deserve their own land seems odd to me, it seems like a very modern notion of nationalism. In 1948 there were Palestinian Arabs and Palestinian Jews, but no ""Palestinians"". The big issue for most of the last 100 years was whether Arab nationality was more important that Islamic nationality. Very few of the borders that we see today as set lasted more than 50 to 100 years. For example the biggest reason Lebanon is a separate country is that France (for reasons that would seem odd today) wanted influence/control of Syria and so a line was drawn that we see as the Israel-Jordan/Lebanon-Syria borders. Under the Turks that was all one place. (Well, it was for some time and at various times, borders moved a lot.)

So, no, the Palestinians are not taking the blame for Europe or for the Arabs. The Palestinians are Arabs and take the blame for their own actions.

&gt; ""They are ready (to make a deal),"" Al-Assad told CNN's Cal Perry in an exclusive interview. ""They were ready, they are ready. Today, the factors have changed so the requirement will change at the same time.  
&gt;   
&gt; ""We cannot talk about the same condition, like what happened a few years ago. Otherwise, we'll keep moving from a cease-fire to another conflict to another breaking of this cease-fire and so on. The more blood you have, the more difficult to talk about peace will be.""  
&gt;   
&gt; Al-Assad met with French President Nicolas Sarkozy earlier Tuesday. Sarkozy appealed to Al-Assad for help in bringing about a halt to the conflict in the Middle East -- an Israeli incursion into Gaza following eight days of Israeli airstrikes.
&gt;   
&gt; Palestinians point to the action as evidence of Israeli aggression; Israel maintains it was defending itself from repeated rockets fired into the southern part of the country by Hamas militants in Gaza.
&gt;   
&gt; Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, but receives backing from Syria, which considers it a resistance movement. Exiled Hamas leader Khalid Meshaal lives in Damascus.
&gt;   
&gt; ""The support is political, the support of their cause,"" Al-Assad told CNN. ""They are under aggression ... actually what they do is respond, they don't start. So we support their cause. We support the Palestinian state, independent Palestinian state, and we support their position to defend themselves."" *
&gt;   
&gt; Earlier Tuesday, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair said that any cease-fire in the Gaza conflict will require ""clear and definitive action"" to halt the smuggling of weapons and money into the Hamas-ruled Palestinian territory.
&gt;   
&gt; ""If there is strong action on that front, so that Israel feels it has achieved something -- namely the end of the smuggling of weapons and finance to Hamas -- then I think it is possible to resolve this reasonably quickly,"" Blair told CNN.
&gt;   
&gt; "" If that doesn't happen, if we're not in that position, then obviously it's going to go on.""
&gt;   
&gt; Blair is now the envoy of the Mideast Quartet, whose members -- the United Nations, United States, Russia and the European Union -- are attempting to find a resolution to the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
&gt;   
&gt; He is one of several European officials now in the region in an effort to bring an end to the Israeli campaign against Gaza.
&gt;   
&gt; Sarkozy met Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to press for a 48-hour humanitarian cease-fire -- a plan Olmert's government considered and rejected last week. And a European Union delegation will also meet with Palestinian and other regional leaders during its visit.
&gt;   
&gt; But Olmert spokesman Mark Regev said any cease-fire must guarantee ""real quiet"" -- and prevent Hamas from replenishing and expanding its arsenal.
&gt;   
&gt; ""Before the last cease-fire with Hamas began, Hamas had missiles with a range of 20 km (13 miles),"" Regev said. ""By the end of the cease-fire, the range of the missiles grew to 40 km. Israel does not want the next cease-fire to allow them to get missiles with a range of 60 km.""
&gt;   
&gt; Hamas won control of the Palestinian Authority parliament in elections in 2006 and wrested control of Gaza from Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party in 2007. But it refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist, and Israel, the United States and the EU consider it a terrorist organization.

&gt; Meanwhile, Arab foreign ministers met at the United Nations to work up a U.N. draft resolution calling for Israel to stop its offensive in Gaza and for Hamas, which rules the territory, to cease firing rockets at the Jewish state.

Don't really know where the hell Mr. Crazy got ""Galabekian"", but one possibility looks to be [Maranao](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maranao) (apparently an ethnic group with a language of the same name in the philippines), where ""gal*e*bek"" and ""gal*e*bekian"" seem to be meaningful (maybe something to do with ""doing work""), based on spotting it [here](http://www.tamano.info/pananadem/) \(Ch04\) and typing galebek into that site's dictionary [here](http://www.tamano.info/glossary/) 

I do not actually speak Maranao in the slightest, no particular idea what those sites are about, that's just a random guess based on an idle (very idle...) google search - but just maybe he's a Maranao crazy ...or maybe it's just coincidence.

**edit** :
Er. Actually, Mr. Crazy seems to have moved from just calling *himself* ""Sergei Galabekian"" (thus sounding eastern european rather than filipino I guess. Might even be his real name) in early [2007](http://www.tmz.com/2007/01/05/justin-enlists-scarlett-johansson-for-video/) (in comments) to claiming the ""original"" Scarlett's last name is Galabekian in late 2008.

That sounds like a certain progression. But not exactly in the good, on the meds now, direction, more the direction of someone whose increasing mental illness may well eventually lead him to try to kill the ""clone"" of his ""lost wife"", the ""original"".

The weird emphasis on ""christian"" also kinda sounds like he found out she's actually jewish - not an issue for normal folk but might be causing a bit of cognitive dissonance for someone with a particularly bigoted outlook who finds themselves attracted to her.  Attracted to her but she's jewish? Simple, decide she's a clone of an unknown ""decent christian"" woman, conditioned to be evil by a shadowy military-industrial complex!

You seem to make a point to eliminate the Israeli claim over the land because they were removed by force from thier land 1300 years ago.  Yet, that the Palestinians have lived in the land for thousands of years give them claim to it.  Well, in total, the Jewish people also lived on the land for thousands of years also. Since you have qualified the length of time as a valid qualifier over rights to the land, then it also gives the Jewish people rights over the land.

The Jewish people were banished by force, right?  So, that is how they reclaimed the land.  In summary... its a war and the strongest will win or kill the world in the process.  Hopefully there is a peaceful solution in the end, but I am very skeptical.

&gt;The ceasefire is to be absolute, binding both the IDF and all the militant groups in Gaza. Should the truce hold, and after several days, Israel stands to reopen the Karni and Sufa goods crossings, allowing large quantities of food, fuel, building materials and other goods into the strip, in order to facilitate its economy.
 
&gt;Once the Karni and Sufa crossings open – and prior to the reopening of the Rafah crossing – the negotiations to release kidnapped IDF soldier Gilad Shalit are to be accelerated.

&gt;Both Israel and Egypt have linked the opening of Rafah crossing to Shalit's release. As far as the Egyptians are concerned, opening the crossing would require Hamas to agree to Palestinian Authority forces and EU monitors to be stationed in the crossing in a supervising capacity.

Looking at the list of [rocket and mortar attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rocket_and_mortar_attacks_in_Israel_in_2008)  continuing through the months of the supposed ceasefire reveals Israel opening crossings, then often temporarily closing crossings near to rocket and mortar attacks. 

Examples: June 30th, also, 

&gt;July 2, 2008: There were no rocket or mortar attacks so Israel reopens the four Gaza crossings on Wednesday July 2. Since a truce began June 19, Israel has closed the passages a total of six days in retaliation for rocket attacks.

&gt;July 3, 2008: A rocket lands in an open area north of Sderot. A previously unknown organization calling itself the ""Badr Forces"" claims responsibility for the attack. In response Israel temporarily closes the crossings on July 4, 2008.

&gt;July 7, 2008: A mortar shell is fired at Israel from Gaza on Monday and lands near the Karni crossing.

&gt;July 8, 2008: After two mortar attacks from Gaza at the Sufa crossing, one fell just inside Gaza and the other at the crossing. Israel closed all the crossing. After an Egyptian request they reopened the crossings. Hours after the crossings opened at noon, militants fired another shell into Israel, causing no casualties or damage, the Israeli military said. Israel kept the crossings open. No Palestinian group immediately claimed responsibility.

&gt;In all, 15 rockets and mortars have been fired from Gaza since the truce took effect on June 19. Israel has responded automatically by snapping shut the crossings, which have been closed about half of the time. So far the truce has not eased conditions in Gaza because of the frequent closures.

However, the only way it will stop is if one party decides to not retaliate for once, and I'd say the onus is on Israel as the significantly more powerful entity and the original instigators of the conflict to be the ""bigger man"" and take some minor hits for the sake of showing good faith and a willingness to work for peace.

Agreed to a degree -- however, it would only be feasible and lasting if at the same time, ""the Palestinians"" (I love how both sides are always made out to be these lock-stepping, monolithic groups) realized ""nuh uh, no how, ain't working"" and told Hamas, the PLO, the PFLP, and every other bearded muppet toting an AK and a gasoline bomb to gtfo.  And at the same time, the Israelis would need to put a pretty solid leash on every lubavitcher or militant settler with an attitude and an M-16.  Real likely, that.

Several Israeli friends of mine, whom I consider as fairly neutral as it's possible to get on their ""side"" have related descriptions of the fighting and its contexts that, to say the least, do not match with a lot of what we get in European and American media.  Let's face it, the Israelis are just godawful at propaganda and public relations.  As such, I am increasingly convinced that the only way to get these guys apart is a big fence, like around the West Bank -- and the Israelis have already managed to screwed that one up to a large degree by not being real judicious about where they put the damn thing.  Oh well, the cycle continues.

&gt; Of course these are always factors. I should probably qualify 'occupation by a modern army' with ', especially in a tightly-controlled urban setting'. Guerrilla warfare is much more doable when you've got a jungle or mountains to hide in, and when arms can be easily smuggled in, but neither of those is the case with Palestine.

I'll respectfully disagree on this one, at least partially -- I don't believe the setting is necessarily the determining factor.  Remember that urban warfare, if you're not allowed to either flatten or just go around the place, is a vile nightmare for modern, mobile armies.  It's important, but equally critical are the relationship between 

* how willing your own population is to take (and inflict) civilian casualties on the ""enemy""
* how willing your own population is to accept military casualties without a clearly identifiable goal or enemy, which also depends on whether you have a militia/draft or a volunteer army, and whether your political system is more democratic or more totalitarian, or whether your troops come from an ethnically / culturally homogenous background (cohesiveness being a fairly important factor.)  You'll note that Eastern European partisans or the Maquis in WWII made a highly effective contribution to defeating the Axis, but they would not have done it alone, as the Germans generally didn't care how many guys they lost or how many civilians they wiped out, as long as it did not directly impact their fighting strength.
* The same for your enemy.
* The perceived injustice inflicted by the other side -- one of the reasons the US failed in Vietnam is because, on top of the factors above, most of the US population didn't even know where South Vietnam was, let alone why we were helping them.  The same thing goes for the war and occupation in Iraq.  By contrast, toppling an Afghan regime and trying to pacify a country that, in addition to being medieval and unjust, aided and abetted an attack on your own civilians and infrastructure, seems to be pretty well accepted.  The only issue I see many Americans having with that particular war is that it's not receiving the resources or attention needed to do it right, regardless of whether it's winnable or not.

I see your reasoning, but would point out that, while jungle / mountainous terrain is easier to hide in, modern surveillance technology to a large degree invalidates that advantage.  In a city, you have noncombatants to hide among, which brings up my points 1 and 2 again -- your fight at that point becomes only about 10% military and 90% propaganda.",False,,c02s,True,0,1231320601,[deleted],1,1,0

The epidemics were certainly the principal *direct cause* of the high mortality rates (in Mesoamerica at least), but the correlation between these deaths and economic exploitation by the Europeans of the Natives is well documented. For hundreds of years, tribute demands from the colonizers coupled with the inevitable agricultural crisis led to plagues that killed millions. European observers agreed with this, like Zorita, Motolinía and Mendieta.

The plagues killed millions, but were severely aggravated after the Native social structure had been destroyed by the Conquest wars and those left behind had become vassals of the various Colonizers. The mechanics of those genocides are analogous to the [Holodomor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor) and the [Great Leap Forward](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_leap_forward), except perhaps an order of magnitude greater and lasting 350 years.

The epidemics if you actually read my posts and relevant research on this field would show you pretty nanimously that Europeans didn't go out of their way to spread disease, it was just a consequence of those with more diseases in their culture but stronger immune systems encountering cultures with fewer diseases and weaker immune systems. This is attributable to most of the Americas not doing much in the way of animal domestication. It doesn't matter if lower estimates don't make sense to you or not. You cite estimates as facts when even those making the estimates know they aren't facts and that there is little agreement on the matter.

Most of the deaths occurred after first encounters with Europeans trough disease transmission which was the absolutely most devastating thing that happened to American Indians. Europeans in some cases exploited this and in others made deals with different Indian groups.

Zorita exaggerated his claims to expedite action to wrest control from the encomederos and had arrived on the scene after disease devastated the natives, not before. You are citing him as a witness to something he did not witness.

The Franciscan monk Motolinía wasn't know to say what it seems you are attributing to him either though he generally did want the Aztecs treated well.

Mendieta thought it was good that Indians were working for the spaniards but overall thought Indians should be confined to certain areas and the Spaniards to another.

In any case these observers you cite weren't there hundreds of years after Columbus landed in the Caribbean unless you want to change 1492 to an earlier century. I don't remember the dates for Zorita but for Mendieta and Motolinia they were there around 1525 Motolinia being there a bit earlier and Mendieta working under him later.

The Indian population was in decline BEFORE any Europeans showed up due likely to an overall lower birthrate. They also suffered from syphillis and what was called cocoliztli which both originated in the Americas and wiped out many Indians before typhus or small-pox ever touched the continents.

In fact in the book you cited earlier by Thornton you might notice around page 40 that Thornton is pretty clear that war and violence played very little in the decline of Indian populations.

Dr. Richard H. Steckel and Dr. Jerome C. Rose both state that pre-Columbian populations began declining nearly 1,000 years prior to Columbus' arrival.

Dr. Philip D. Curtin based on skeletal studies stated ""shows conclusively that however much it may have deteriorated on contact with the outer world, it was far from paradisiacal before the Europeans and Africans arrived.""

In the larger Indian societies there was a good deal of social stratification. The poorest made up the masses, ate the worst and least diverse diets and were most likely to get sick and spread the illness through the city as well as die earlier and earlier. Most pre-Columbian cities didn't have plumbing (I can't recall any but I may just be forgetting some).

The healthiest groups were the most nomadic, the hunter-gatherers that might actually survive until they were 50 as opposed to 35 which was otherwise the oldest most could hope to live to in the best of circumstance.

Do you not grasp human psychology at all ? 

The difference is what's done is done to the Indian's and no non Indian American is going to actually say it was a bad idea to effectively invade your land, not that you guys actually had borders or anything. 

So, if you want people to pay attention to Gaza... DEAR LORD do not compare it to the Native American thing because they will just make people want to deny Gaza. 

Now, on non American populations that would be an ok statement to make, but then non American populations don't care about American Indians either :P No offense but think about what your saying.

Your telling American's that the conquest of their own nation was a mistake, a mistake comparable to Israel going into Gaza.

If that's the case, Israel is making the greatest move of their life and will soon be a world power. The end doesn't have to justify the means, but it's the final outcome either way.

That outcome is the worlds greatest Democracy and still leader in civil rights, science and pretty much all high technology. 

So, how can you really expect people to consider a land war hundreds of years ago which turned out great for them to be a reason for Israel to not invade Gaza.

Just because things have similarities doesn't mean they bring out the same emotions in people, and when trying to make a passionate point, you need to appeal to their emotions. 

You're better off comparing Gaza to Hitler's invasion of Poland or something people actually have to see as a negative. 

The suffering of the Native American's sucked, but the outcome was pretty good for today's Americans and lets face it, Native American's would not have held up against any invading force from Europe or Asia. They were just sitting there waiting to be invaded with no real science output or even governing advances. 

You don't have to like it, but they were a doomed civilization holding onto tribal ways. Minimalism is great, but the practicality of a brutal world and a brutal time make survive a top priority. 

Land wars, conquests were all accepted things and it's nobody's fault the Native American's were so under prepared but their own. Had they developed better travel and not been isolated they could have benefiting from trade and better tools and weapons. So, it was bound to happen and sadly those things happen to the nicest people, especially in times were people only lived to be 30. 

Blaming today's Americans or expecting them to feel guilty is actually pretty ridiculous. I don't care about Native Americans or black people plight. It's hundreds of years later, deal with it. I didn't rich off taking your land or slavery, so I don't want to here the endless bullshit.

Gaza is completely different if you actually follow the history, which quite complicated compared to American Indian history. We have a holy city, a series of wars, Exoduses, thousands of years of persecution of the Jews. 

The only similarity is you have a superior invading force. But Israel is checked by world power, they can't actually invade and take big chunks of land like they used to. They are just nutballs, and I'd probably be crazy too if I had to live next door to Hamas and the idiots who put them in power. 

We make a lot of excuses for the Palestinian people because they are the underdogs. In reality they are committing war crimes by purposely targeting civilians. Until that stops, Israel can keep beating the shit out of them. They are the next stop down from Nazi's until they stop targeting civlians. Really, we have these rules of war for a reason, beacuse western culture reached a point of mass destruction and chemical death far behind anything all the terrorist organizations in the world could accomplish. We had mass production and use of chemical agents of horrible death. One thing white man knows best, is war, and it's a mistake to disregard the difference between armed targets and helpless civilians.

Of course, Native American and Colonists would have slayed civilians without too much problem.

I think the Palestinians must know by now, they could get the worlds support if they would just play by the rules, but I think they prefer this endless battle. Both sides aren't looking for peace in any meaningful way. Their cultures are not interested in peace, just their occasional sound bytes and headlines and bullshit peace talks. 

So, get real, the US and even Europe have nothing to do with this conflict. We didn't invent Israel or the Holy Land and we didn't convince the Jews to slowly gather there from all corners of the world. We didn't drive them from their lands. All we did is go along with Europe's anti immigration plan.

They didn't want all the displaced Jews, so we gave them land, right where they had been gathers for the last couple thousand years.

It's not like the world arbitrarily picked Palestine. By most accounts Jews are from that area and where gather to that area. It may have been a tactical mistake to create Israel, but it made sense and the Palestinians shouldn't have an innate right to their homeland just because the drove them out of it one time.

That doesn't make sense either, and that's why it's such a never ending conflict, because both sides clearly have legit claims. Like, if Israel had just taken their land by force without the UN, that wouldn't make things any more peaceful. It would still be just a simple land war. Maybe Muslims wouldn't be Holocaust deniers, but beyond that the situation would be the same.

Western involvement doesn't keep Israel alive, they are the superior power in the middle east with or without US aid. I don't know how much they get from other nations but probably less and we only give them 4 billion, hardly enough to complete dominate an entire region. If that was the case the Iraq war wouldn't have cost 600+ billion. That's 150 years of aid to Israel just to be beat back by their insurgency for a couple years. 

So, the suggestion it's that tiny bit of aid rising Israel to power is again just another ridiculous sound byte. 

The only power America has in the conflict is to be bully and say , stop or else. Personally I don't even want to be involved in whatever failed peace plan follows this. Just ignore both countries, cut off aid, move on like a bad relationship.

The Jews and the Palestinians are really just the same people with different religions. They are from the same area and neither has a valid claim that the land belong to them entirely. The sound and rather look alike. 

Israel was never setup to kill Palestinians. They've been trying to form a homeland there for thousands of years, it has absolutely nothing to do with the Palestinians except they  are from the same region. 

Israel does however abuse it's power and position. But it's not because of some clandestine reason. It's because Palestinians are persistent little bastards that won't give up even in the face of overwhelming odds. 

They are so stubborn and passionate they don't even blink resorting to suicide bombing and targeting civilians. It takes decades of oppression usually to drive a civilized man to that. 

But the desire for the rest of the world for these two idiotic nations to stop fighting is real. The west really only backs Israel because it feel obligated, they've been our long time ally. If anything it costs us billions in extra fuel costs because of all the added conflict primarily centering around Israel, which I think is safe to say why the hate the idea of any permanent western base or such.

It was never a protective ground.

It was clearly an alternative to having all the jews immigrate into Europe. We just put them with their own people really. It was either there Syria or Egypt and basically Palestine fought back the least :P

Few people realize Europe's Jew phobia drove the creation of Israel more than anything. But most populations fear large waves of immigrants. All that Nazi propaganda probably didn't help either.

Wow, ""we tend to preserve your culture more than you do"", that's quite a patronizing statement. I am sure those cultures you preserve enjoy being seen as static concepts in museums. Librarians also see themselves as preservers of English culture. Those kids in England today are just shav savages, not at all representative of English at all.

You cite estimates as facts when even those making the estimates know they aren't facts and that there is little agreement on the matter.

I previously implied that the colonizers ""didn't go out of their way to spread disease"", so I don't understand why you assume I believe otherwise. My argument was that economic exploitation (through tribute and enslavement for mining, for example) worsened the plagues (and famines). And I explicitly stated that the lower estimates don't make sense *to me*, I am not citing them as fact. I just think the middle-high estimates make more sense, and since there's no consensus, then I don't see the problem with having an opinion.

&gt; Most of the deaths occurred after first encounters with Europeans trough disease transmission which was the absolutely most devastating thing that happened to American Indians. Europeans in some cases exploited this and in others made deals with different Indian groups.

In many cases the deaths preceded first contact with Europeans, which also implies that population density was high enough over large parts of the Americas to permit this. Yet another reason why I don't agree with the lower estimates. Alliances with Europeans was well documented, and I have no issue with this, but those native allies were promptly ""backstabbed"" by the Europeans, as was the case with the Purepecha civilization, so they gained little in the long term and cannot be accused of having benefitted from the economic exploitation (much).

&gt; Zorita exaggerated his claims to expedite action to wrest control from the encomederos and had arrived on the scene after disease devastated the natives, not before. You are citing him as a witness to something he did not witness.

What? Zorita states ""these people, common to all the Indies, are diminishing in number and coming to an end ... because of the great affliction that the tributes and charges have on them; and I found this out *visiting myself*"" (my translation and emphasis). *He* said he witnessed it, but *you* know better, because you're an anthropologist?  And again, he spoke of the economic exploitation, not the disease, which you don't even address. For the views of Motolinía and Mendieta, see Kubler. As to the Republics of Naturals and the Republics of Spanish you allude to, maybe it could have been a good idea, but failed due to the inability of the colonial authorities to decide exactly how to maintain this ""apartheid"" system. In mine at least, it seem to have worked fine until the late 1800s, but it was rather isolated to begin with.

I find it amusing though that some anthropologists can claim populations were decreasing (which I don't really disagree with, population fluctuations are normal) with so much certainty. Almost like saying ""look, it doesn't matter that the Europeans came there and enslaved millions and millions more died of alien diseases, they were dying out anyway!"". Populations undoubtedly decreased locally during the Mayan and Olmec and Teotihuacan and Cahokian collapses, but increased afterwards elsewhere. There's no reason to believe it wouldn't have done the same if not for the Old World diseases.

As far as I know, I don't think anyone knows what cocoliztli is but Nahua today use the term for plagues in general, so maybe it was just a general term for unrelated diseases with similar symptoms. Regardless, if you don't even know what it was, how can it be cited as a reason for population decrease? Well, I guess anthropologists could say, ""people died because they were sick"", but that just sounds rather... pointless.

&gt; In fact in the book you cited earlier by Thornton you might notice around page 40 that Thornton is pretty clear that war and violence played very little in the decline of Indian populations.

I didn't cite anything, but I think it could be argued also that enslavement is a sort of violence, as well as demanding tribute in times of agricultural crisis, but maybe this Thornton just has his own, very personal definition. Maybe he thinks Palestinians civilians in Gaza without water or food are not victims of Israeli aggression either.

&gt; Dr. Philip D. Curtin based on skeletal studies stated ""shows conclusively that however much it may have deteriorated on contact with the outer world, it was far from paradisiacal before the Europeans and Africans arrived.""

Only naive individuals believe that the Americas were a paradise before the Europeans though, but at least the natives could aspire to be more of less alive and free, and have some land, and maybe even some sovereignty. It sounds like your arguing ""because it wasn't perfect, then a whole lot worse should be tolerable"".

&gt; In the larger Indian societies there was a good deal of social stratification. The poorest made up the masses, ate the worst and least diverse diets and were most likely to get sick and spread the illness through the city as well as die earlier and earlier. Most pre-Columbian cities didn't have plumbing (I can't recall any but I may just be forgetting some).
&gt; The healthiest groups were the most nomadic, the hunter-gatherers that might actually survive until they were 50 as opposed to 35 which was otherwise the oldest most could hope to live to in the best of circumstance.

Sources? As you say, animal domestication, the precursor of capitalism in the Old World, never caught on in the New World. The poorer, as the majority of the population, were also the producers, and hence had first access to foodstuff. Since transport was all human-powered, then I don't understand how someone eight hours from a urban center would eat worse or less diverse than the merchants in the urban center. Urban poor certainly had it tough, but that's the case everywhere and there was no New World exceptionalism.

The Israeli's aren't doing ANYTHING near what the imperialists did. You may as well be telling a comedy routine if you think these are the facts. Back then 100 years of war meant... real war, not a couple weeks of war and then break time. 

White's have been put into slavery as well. I don't feel any more sorry for you than I do blacks or all the millions of indentured servants and surfs and such. It's a shame to be poor in a rich mans world, but most of us aren't rich.

Sadly minorities don't seem to understand that white people aren't just one big homogeneous groups of immoral bastards. First off, if I'm white, then you're Incan, you're EVERY type of Indian like ethnicity. So, you believe in human sacrifice you immoral bastard.

It's a joke, listening to minorities complain about the great white menace. Like you can't even really refer to white people as being from their own ethnicity. We aren't Germain or Irish or Italian.. we are just crackers. 

4 million people in 50 years... that's not impressing me much for a time when people only lived to be 30. I think you math is failing you. 

You need to read up on history more if you can't see the difference between hundreds of years of war and the Holocaust. WW2 resulted in over 70 million people dieing in only 5 years and it was a much different time where the world was a much smaller place and there was nowhere to run. 

American Indians had time to fallback, to regroup and to try to fight. They were not rounded up like domestic animals and slaughtered. They fought and lost badly. There is an enormous difference. Hitler was intent on true genocide, colonists were not. That's a big difference as well. 

It's one thing to lose a war badly, completely and entirely different to hunt people down and systematically kill and torture them.

You can bet plenty of white slaves during the thousands of years of slavery in Europe suffered every atrocity imaginable. And just because we don't have a memorial and a fancy name like.. The Holocaust.. doesn't mean it's not just as bad or worse. 

White people have just gotten over their ethnicity a long time ago. We don't use it as a limitation or excuse for things even though the worst wars and most hateful deeds were done by white people, to white people. That's why there is no strong white pride like you see in other minorities. 

We'd rather ignore your ethnicity but your refuse to let us and would rather bring up all the things that some colonist who almost none of us are related to did.

Do you understand that most people are immigrants from after the period of time you even talking about.

So, you really can only blame this tiny minority of white families they came here during colony days. Most of us are German American's and came in the 1800's. 

So keep that in mind when trying to blame us all for your people's history. Most of our families were over in Europe getting the shit beat out of us and fighting to the death for bread crumbs. 

But that's the history the oppressed minorities don't want to live up to. We've all been oppressed. Now take a deep breath, and grow up. 
150 years of conflict cannot be called a Holocaust, it was a war, clearly and without a doubt. 

Plus as I've said you can't realistically make American's feel sorry for turning America into America. Because there would be no Democracy no capitalism and basically nothing but a nation waiting to be invaded by the next guy. 

Native American's had their chance and they lost and that's just life. If you want to try rise up again and take back your homeland, that's your choice. 

But why not just accept that being American is more important that your ethnicity. Democracy is the white mans idea. Most everything we've built our success on required the Native American's to lose. 

It's not like we conqurerd the Indians and then went on savagely beating nations into pulp. America has reserved itself well over the years. We even had the atomic bomb and didn't bother to conquer the world with it. We have the best overall civil rights record. We have the most technology and schools. 

How could that have all happened if we had lost against American Indians ? You'd just be conquered by Russia or China or some other people who'd probably treated you even worse. That's the reality of life 500 years ago and if you want to talk about it, you have to talk about it in the context of the morals of that era, not in the context of today's morals.

And you know that, but you whine anyway to get attention. If the Indians had the advantages, they'd have done plenty of immoral things to us, and they did given the chance. You think scalping is more white mans lies ? These people could be as bloodthirsty as anyone and they probably realize they were overpowered by technology until it was too late. 

We do have clear evidence of colonies just up and disappearing and unprovoked raids. It's not like white man come over with the intention of genocide as you make it sound. We had no clue there was a land war waiting for us over there, we were just fleeing Europe. And when I say we I mean white people in general. My people didn't come over until the mid 1800, like most Americans today, we don't have colonist roots. So all this slavery and Native American shit is just a waste of breath. 

Why don't people realize, that most Americans don't have roots that go back to slavery or colonist days. 

I would think with all the jaded and bitter plotting your go against the white man, you'd consider that most of us were still over in Europe while your supposed Holocaust happened. 

Schools don't teach it as a Holocaust for a reason, there death rates are not even remotely comparable. You say 70 million people, but over the course of 30 times longer than the holocaust. Plus I don't buy a figure that big for the total Indian population. There is no way they had that many people without better civilization building and agricultural skills. 

Plus if the Indian population was that big, white man would never have stood a chance. These were just a few thousand colonists coming over at a time. I think you have produced one of these Rush Limbaugh statistic on us personally, but it could be possible.

In a large number of European countries you will see Christian political parties. These parties are simply that political parties with all their trappings. A Christian party is just as corrupt, incompetent and self-righteous as any other. Even though most Europeans distinguish between a Christian political party and the church itself, it still isn't enough not to tarnish the religion.

Also you need to see how the evolution of political power in europe wasn't between just two forces: the Aristocracy and the people, but a three-way struggle that included the Church. So after 500 years of struggle to get democracy Europeans aren't too keen to give power back to the church.

So to summarise: polticising religions have made Europeans jaded about religions.

I entirely agree with you. But from the standpoint of Israel's ultra-nationalists and religious fundamentalists, there's the ""Demographic Bomb"".

What's that? Well like most poor people, the Palestinians have more children than the more economically secure Israelis. Extrapolate that out a generation or two, an you have a nominally ""democratic"" Israel with a a majority non-Jewish population.

Israel's tried a number of stratagems to get around this, most notably using the ""Right of Return"", which applies only to Jews, to get Jews to immigrate to Israel. 

So far, so good. The ""problem"" is, this means Ethiopian Jews, Russian Jews, Sephardic Jews from the Middle East. And while nominally Jewish, these peoples have far different cultural backgrounds than the Western European Zionists who first settled in Israel.

This leads to all sort of clashes *within* Israel's Jewish population: the Ethiopians are looked down on for being black, the Russians are stereotyped as gangsters and prostitutes.

And the ultra-religious Jews *regularly* go on ""patrols"" to beat up *Jewish* women who dress ""immodestly"". The ultra-religious burn down *Jewish* stores that sell DVD players, because those layers can be used to play porn -- or R-rated movies. And they burn brothels to kill Russian prostitutes. 

(In the 1950s, the Israeli government -- with US Army funding -- even performed secret radiation experiments on the unconsenting kids of Sephardic Jewish immigrants. Despite Israeli produced documentaries exposing this, the kids -- now dying of cancers -- have never even gotten an apology.)

So bulking up the Jewish demographics by immigration just isn't working, it causes too many tensions within the various Jewish populations, and leds to Jewish racism against Jews. 

So the only other possibility to defuse the ""Demographic Bomb"" is to *reduce* the Arab/Palestinain population. To drive them out of Israel. The attack on Gaza aims to either kill Palestinians, or make their lives such a living hell that they give up and go away.

No doubt that Jews are one of the most discriminated against ethnic groups in history and that the creation of Israel was partly due to both the the desire to keep Jews from mass-migrating to only a few European countries and because everybody felt bad about the concentration camps (but not bad enough to want Jews to immigrate to their country, it seems).

On the other hand, in Europe the oppression of the religious elite remained unbearable.  Notably in France, the people freed themselves from a dominating religion through revolution.  Religion suffered a big backlash because it was seen as a bad thing, and the new republic implemented separation of church and state.

Later, during the cold war, religion got a boost in the USA.  Americans used religion to differenciate themselves from the ""godless"" communists.

&gt; It was either there Syria or Egypt and basically Palestine fought back the least :P

No. You are totally uninformed about the history of the region. Palestine was chosen by the World Zionist Organization in the late 1800s. Since then, the WZO started a big PR campaign in the West to enhance their goal, with such lies as ""a land with no people for a people with no land"". With the fall of the Ottomans after WW1, Britain and France decided to divide the Arab nations amongst them. The WZO pressed on the British government (which, conveniently, had many sympathetic Jews), and got them to come up with the [Balfour Declaration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration_of_1917). If you read this declaration, and every other official British declaration of the time, you will notice that there is no mention of the Palestinians as a people, giving the illusion that the establishment of a Jewish state will not affect anybody, and nullifying themselves from any promises toward an independent Arab Palestine (this is in direct contrast to all of the neighbouring Arabic countries, and to almost all other British colonies). In all other British colonies, quasi governments were established made up almost completely of the native population. The heads of these quasi governments answer to the British authorities. In Palestine, by contrast, none of the Arab Palestinians were given any positions in this government. It was composed entirely of European Jewish immigrants.

&gt; Few people realize Europe's Jew phobia drove the creation of Israel more than anything.

True. Zionists started to immigrate to Palestine from the late 1800s. In the 1920s and early 1930s, many started leaving Palestine, mainly to the US. It wasn't until the horrors of the Holocaust that European Jews started moving into Palestine in greater numbers. In addition to their shear numbers, it brought in money, and skilled labor.

1) Insurance companies across the board reported fewer accidents and fewer deaths in March of 2008, when gas prices were peaking. This is because fewer people drove, instead opting for public transportation or other means of travel (carpooling, bicycling, etc)

2) Because of the drop in accidents, injuries, and death, insurance prices across the board began a downward trend (which has since stopped since people are back on the road)

3) A personal gain for me, roads are noticeably less congested; at least here in DC…I can’t attest to anywhere else. Without all the stop-and-go traffic, and with less congestion, my tank of gas lasts about a week and a half instead of just a week.

4) So long as we are buying foreign oil, any oil-supplying country (ie, Middle East, Russia…) can hold us hostage. For a good example, read that reddit front page story about how Russia punished Europe at the beginning of 2009, for gas price disputes.

5) The unwillingness to buy gas-munching vehicles drives companies to create more fuel efficient technology

6) Despite what anyone says, the gas tax does NOT disproportionately hurt the poor. The ""poor"" generally buy cheaper cars which have fewer cylinders, weigh less, and don’t require premium grade gasoline. Generally speaking, the more expensive a car, the more it costs to keep the car on the road.

7) Pollution goes way down….I don’t really care about that one, but others do, so that’s a bonus to them

For other readers this is North America centric only.  Different systems in Europe and Asia, as usual.

HD Radio isn't really related to HD TV, except they both use the marketing spin of ""high definition"".  The bands for HDTV are the same VHF bands as analog and HD Radio bands are the same FM band sitting in the middle of TV VHF, so perhaps you could use the same and split them.

HD Radio is a subcarrier transmission on regular analog FM broadcast and is narrowband.  A regular FM antenna should be fine because they are ""cramming"" the HD signal into a standard FM broadcast - the special part is the encoding  before transmission and decoding after reception of the regular FM transmission.

HD TV is wideband and abandons traditional TV signal formats, so it needs a ""special"" wideband antenna mostly because HDTV more sensitive to signal to noise ratio (SNR) problems than analog (you always trade encoded data rate or modulating signal bandwidth for SNR - there are no free lunches).

The only concern would be that splitting might affect the already low signal levels of your HDTV which is already sensitive to noise.

Splitting, depending on the type of splitter, will at best drop the signal strength by 50% but some splitters are worse because they don't really do decent impedance match when they split the signal so losses are higher.

I would try to do a non-destructive experiment first: add a splitter but only at a point where you have a connector (back of your HD TV or HD converter, for example) to see how much effect it has on HDTV signal strength.  That way if it's bad you won't be messing with the cable integrity by cutting it.

I'd bet that someone has created a hybrid FM/HD antenna already and is selling it.  They had the same for FM and analog TV (VHF and UHF) for decades, so it's not original nor is it difficult.  This would be a safer route because they've already dealt with this insertion/non-insertion issue.

Rome, by the 4th century AD... was becoming more and more a back-water.  Finally, [Constantine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_I)  officially moved the Capital out of Rome and to Constantinople, modern Istanbul.   In real practice it hadn't been the capital for about a century then.

Of the five great patriarchies of the early Church, only Rome was in the West.  The other four: Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria were all deeply embedded in the Eastern Roman Empire.  

For the first thousand years Constantinople and Rome dueled it out for supremacy in the Early Church.    And even today you still see some remnants of the old arguments between the two.  

Much of the policies that were enacted and carried out by the Roman Government that helped the spread of Christianity were enacted from the East.  The Emperors of the Eastern Empire took personal interest in the issues of Church doctrine.  Constantine presided over the [First Council of Nicaea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea), which gave Christianity the [Nicene Creed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed).  The Emperors considered themselves the head of the Church, and that various patriarchs -- including the Pope in Rome -- to be subservient to them.   The fact that Rome was an economic back-water that fell out of the political control of the Eastern Empire after a while... that allowed the Pope a certain of independence that wasn't afforded the other patriarchies.  If the Religious head at Alexandra got out of line, he could be ordered to go and appear before the Emperor by the local officials.  Rome, being outside the Empire now... well, the Pope was outside the Control of the Roman Emperor most of the time.  

Not that the folks at the time saw it this way, but this helped to lead to the idea of the Separation of Church and State in Western Europe -- Especially as the Popes lost more and more temporal power through the years.   And even in the early years, they had to come to understandings with various barbarian kings and warlords over the delineation marks between Church power and State power.  Because the Emperor was the head of both the State and Church in the East, that was a discussion and argument that never happened there.

1. Ukraine did pay for gas shipments, it did not pay fines for late payments. Russia cut supplies because it cannot agree about the price with Ukraine -- Russia insists in rising gas prices and keeping transit fees same, Ukraine insists on increasing transit fees according to gas prices (which is quite logical, as gas is used for transit purposes to keep pressure).

2. Ukraine announced that in absence of contracts with Gazprom it will take about 10% of transit gas for technical purposes of keeping pressure. and it did so -- for five days 90% of gas was transfered to european clients (it is confirmed by them) and about 10% was kept by Ukraine. i have no clue if it really takes 10% of gas to keep pressure in the tube, but if Russia wanted to keep supplies they just needed to send 110% of what Europe asks, i guess it is not a big deal to send it for a week or so, and Ukraine was actually going to pay for this gas once contract is settled.

3. peaceful resolution of issues was not in plan of Gazprom, though. it announced that as Ukraine have ""stolen"" about 65M m^3 of gas, it will cut daily supplies by this amount (total daily supply is like 300M m^3), and Ukraine will have to compensate the rest. (this is official announcement by Gazprom.)

what actually happened is totally different. Naftogaz of Ukraine says that without further announcements pressure started dropping and stopped completely. Gazprom says that it is Ukraine stopped gas shipments.

as it would be totally idiotic for Naftogaz to stop shipments, i believe that what they say is right -- it was actually a Gazprom's plan to stop shipments and blame Ukraine.

and now a question for you, Wis3Man -- are you just misinformed, or you're intentioanally spreading blatant lies?

here is a [link](http://www.forbes.com/afxnewslimited/feeds/afx/2009/01/06/afx5883940.html) to Forbes article which sites Gazprom officials and confirms what i've wrote above -- it implies that through Jan 1-5 Gazprom was shipping 300 mcm daily and most of this gas went to customers, only 65 mcm were stolen, and that Gazprom intentionally cut supplies by this amount wanting Ukraine to compensate the difference.

In this case, there's so much controversy with the whole Israel/Palestine issue that people who favor Israel will applaud their relatively low civilian casualties, while people who question Israel's legitimacy in Gaza will be outraged at every single civilian killed.  

Personally, I don't think it's all that worthwile to debate the morality/appropriateness of Israel's level of civilian casualties right now, because what's far more important is understanding how the Arabs view it.  After all, it doesn't matter whether Americans or Europeans think it's OK; if the surrounding Arabs see it as evil (which they sure as hell do right now), then the violence is only going to beget more violence.

I disagree. Sentimental arguments have little bearing at state department meetings with ice cold motherfuckers like George Kennan, Kissinger, Brzezinski, etc. Not to mention with their constituents: the business community. They are driven solely by strategic power and economic profit and will pick whichever client that is loyal and gets the job done. Israel only became the superdarling after 1967, when it crushed the main center of secular nationalism -- Nasser's Egypt. (The Nasser gov't was a thorn in the eye to Saudi Arabia and the US, because it threatened to use the oil incomes for the benefit of its people instead of for some tyrant and huge sums flowing to western oil companies.) The US would drop Israel in an instant if it decided to, say, normalize relations with Iran or something like that.

&gt; and why it thinks it has to support anyone at all.

Again, it's critical for world hegemony to control middle east oil. That gives veto power over everyone else's (Europe's and Asia's, in particular) policies and actions.

&gt;Who ever showed evidence that we had to struggle forever over the dwindling supply of oil, rather than spend the same amount of money building breeder reactors?

In fact there is overwhelming evidence that we have to stop that or we will destroy ourselves through nuclear war or environmental destruction. Whether that choice will be faced is largely up to you and me and everyone else. Whether we will be able to push the public will into policy or not.

&gt; Who ever showed that we had to implement our interests in the region by arbitrarily picking a side in a local religious conflict between two tribes of backward, zealous idiots?

That has to do with what is considered ""our interests"". If you consider world domination by force to be an interest of yours, then US policy makes quite a lot of sense. If you consider survival of the species, democracy, independence, etc, your interests, then it has been shown that this is a lousy way to go.

&gt;Who ever showed evidence that there was any benefit to picking the backward religious zealots without the stuff we actually wanted in the first place.

You mean they have no oil? Well they don't but they are within striking range of it. That means the US can use Israel to exert general pressure in the region. Israel also has a relatively US-friendly, mostly European population, which makes internal political trouble less likely.

About the religious zealotry: that's pretty useful if it prevents democratic development.

I have never in my life met a selfish Jew. The Jewish people I have known have literally treated me as if I were one of their own. One of my best friends is a Jewish guy that I do not think I would have survived my father's death without his help and friendship.

As for Israel for years I thought of them as this heroic little underdog that was beset and underseige on all sides by enemies. I admired Israel for being able to stand up to them all and go on with their civilization.

My history is correct.  Arabs come from the Arabian peninsula and invaded the rest of the Middle East by force in the Muslim Conquests.  That peninsula is *huge* compared to Israel, what do they need our land for when they have such a large one of their own?

&gt;Many of the people settled in Israel now are actually from Europe anyway. I know way back in the yonks they can claim descent from a swarthy middle easterner but for the most part they are very European looking.

Dude, have you *seen* Israelis?  One of the best things Israel has done for us Jews has been the interbreeding of the various kinds of Jews.  Ashkenazi, Sfardi, and Mizrachi freely marry each other and make children outside of ultra-Orthodox enclaves.  The result is the near-elimination of recessive genetic diseases, and the fact that most Israeli Jews cannot be told from Arabs by appearance.

American Jews often look European because the climate and latitude of America tend to bring out European features in anyone who has remotely European genetics: the place is cold and dark for the most part.  Israel is at roughly the latitude of mid-Florida, and has a very similar climate with the sole difference being that the Israeli deserts do nothing to moderate winter/summer differences.  Put an Ashkenazi (ie: European-mixed) Jew in America, and he will look European.  Put him in Israel and he'll look Middle-Eastern.  The reason?  He *is* Middle Eastern.

&gt;As for Israel for years I thought of them as this heroic little underdog that was beset and underseige on all sides by enemies. I admired Israel for being able to stand up to them all and go on with their civilization.

It isn't about being the underdog or the overdog.  It's about right and wrong.

&gt;But then something changed. Israel became the aggressor in a big big way. Israel has been trying to start shit with everyone around during the entire Bush presidency.

During the Bush presidency, Israel has had to put up with: Bush himself (the fucking twit), the Second Intifada (suicide attacks in nightclubs and cafes, wtf?), the collapse of its partner for peace negotiations in a Palestinian civil war, the continuous rocket fire from Gaza, and Hizballah's aggression from the north.  But you don't hear about these things, do you?

&gt;Israel has been rattling it's saber at Iran for quite awhile now.

This is to protect them from Iran's attempts to build a Middle-Eastern empire by proxy after Bush overthrew the Iraqis that had kept the Iranians in check.  I don't like it very much either, as Jews and Persians are friends of old, but hopefully the Iranian government will moderate itself.  IIRC, their elections are soon and the people of Iran itself don't really like their government spending their money and effort on helping Arabs fight wars for religion.

&gt;When Israel was the underdog I was her friend. But now that Israel has decided to build an empire and corrupt my own country I have had to take away my support for them.

What Israeli empire is this?  What corruption of your country do you mean?  There is the occupation of the West Bank, which is definitely wrong, but I would not call such it an empire until Israel can actually give orders them and expect them obeyed.  Damn tiny empire, at that.

&gt;I understand you are patriotic. You love your land and you love your people. But what I meant in my story is that your blind to how that makes you look to others.

I'm not blind to how I look to others on this site.  I simply don't care.  I acknowledged long ago that this site is filled with genuine anti-Semites, people who simply hate Jews and use Israeli ""aggression"" as an excuse to continue that hatred.  You don't seem to be one such person, but they outnumber sensible Palestine-supporters like you here.  I decided that rather than try to make myself look good to people who would consider that ""Jew lies and propaganda"", I would just state my views in the most direct manner I pleased and at least manage to work out a bit of stress.

&gt;If you want peace you have to be prepared to die for it. And I'm afraid I don't mean with a gun in your hand.

And here we simply differ in values.  I'm a Jew: our values are not to die for peace but to live for it.  We are taught always to choose life over death.  After all, history shows that dying for peace doesn't get you peace; it gets you conquered.  Your people are a testament to that: you ""died for it"" and just got wiped out.  Where is your peace now?

We Jews died for what we believe in for two millenia because we lacked the strength, the ability, to defend ourselves, and all it gave us was tears and some nebulous right to call ourselves victims.  Now that we can defend our people's lives, why should we sacrifice a single one?  Why be victims when we can be free people?",True,,c06w904,True,0,1231379739,eaturbrainz,1,1,0

1. Attack on Sicko. This one actually was quite idiotic from Mr. Gupta. The american health care system has huge problems, and healthy criticism is healthy.

2. Vioxx. You have to work with the data you have at any given moment. Vioxx was retired from the market voluntarily by Merck 11 months after that particular interview. 11 months during which every physician on the planet kept prescribing Vioxx - not just Gupta. Risk evaluation is an essential aspect of practising medicine, and sometimes you go wrong. Back in the day, physicians would treat morphine addiction with Heroin™. Shit happens. Not Gupta's fault, though.

3. Over-hyping a vaccine that potentially prevents [70%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardasil) of all cervix cancer types is the right thing to do. You have to compare potential benefit to potential harm here. Cervical cancer kills 250.000 women per year, so the idiotic position here is the Daily Green position.

4. Outdated, paranoid fears on medical marijuana users? Come the fuck on. At no point in the cited article did Gupta say anything about medical marijuana users. Instead, he provides several examples of marijuana's efficacy in various medical conditions.
His comments on non-medical marijuana users were quite calm and collected as well (short-term memory, cognitive ability, lung problems, driving under the effects). The only trouble seems to be that he would vote 'no' on legalization. Bad propaganda, again.

5. The major route for pthalate exposure is diet. Inhalation is also a route for exposure, but then, many common products contain phtalates. Shampoo, raincoats, detergents, deodorant, vinyl flooring, hairspray, some inflatable toys, medical pharmaceuticals, blood storage bags, intravenous medical tubing... Etc. Accusing the iPhone of posing a health risk because of this is alarmist and idiotic. Accusing Gupta of idiotism because he downplayed this is quite idiotic as well.

Disproportionate compared to what? Progressive means questioning nonsense when you hear it. What counts as proportionate? Tell me.

&gt;a true fight for justice to collectively punish &gt;them?

disproportionate, collective punishment. Got any other buzz words? 

Look. There are casualties in any war. The question in this case, who is responsible for them? The most obvious and non-critical (and wrong) answer is to blame Israel. 

But what about when the population's fighers using actual civilians as protection? Surely Israel can't be blamed for that. What about having fighters dress as civilians and yet still carry out attacks (like suicide bombers)? What about storing military equipment (bombs etc.) in people's homes.

How is Israel supposed to defend itself in that situation and not kill any civilians? How?!

Any *normal* populace would stop fighting and surrender if they were to face the overwhelming military disparity that wee see between Israel and the Arabs living in palestine. But they won't ever surrender when people like you and Arabs and Persians support them financially and politically.

&gt;If you are interested in educating people on &gt;media bias and subjective perception you should &gt;be discussing your ideas in the philosophy &gt;section. Or maybe you could start talking like &gt;this on some pro Israeli posts or sites to be &gt;fair and balanced.

Pro-Israeli people don't need this information. 

&gt;We all know what happened in WW2 - we grow up &gt;with it through TV, films and books. I don't &gt;want to sound trite but believe me when I say I &gt;cried in The Pianist at the inhumanity and &gt;injustice of what happened in the Warsaw Ghetto &gt;to name but one example. But what happened to &gt;the Jews under Nazi Germany should not be used &gt;as a big stick to silence opposing views and &gt;discussion by crying anti-semitism and genocide &gt;all the time. If anything the suspicion is that &gt;Israel uses this as a way of leveraging &gt;colonial power.

What you know of WW2 is very superficial. What about the Arab and Muslim oppression of Jews? What about Arabs and Muslims siding with the Nazi's in WW2? What about the founder of the PLO, haj amin al huseini, engineering much of the holocaust? You know nothing about this stuff. It's not your fault, but if you cried when watching holocaust films, you may kill yourself if you ever find out the truth and realize that you have been helping to spread lies about Israel. Especially when the Jews of Israel get pushed into the sea. Another genocide. This will happen unless people like you see what you are doing.

&gt;I do wonder what has happened to the people who &gt;left Europe to build a new life in the promised &gt;land. It seems to me that they have become not &gt;dissimilar to something they thought they left &gt;behind. It is telling that the first attacks &gt;happened almost at the end of hanukkah and on &gt;the Shabbat.

What happened was they were attacked since Day 1. Ever hear of the war for Israel in 1948 when about six Arab countries attacked Israel at once, all the while murdering and raping the population of 800000 jews that lived in their countries? That's what happened. 

As you mentioned, all stories have multiple sides and all stories about Israel are filtered through those past atrocities carried out against them.

&gt;What do you call a situation where a population &gt;have been herded into a location where all &gt;access to that location is tightly controlled &gt;by an occupying force, where starvation, &gt;disease and access to jobs, food, power and &gt;medical supplies are limited to the barest &gt;minimum?

What do you call it when a nation (The Arabs of Jordan, Syria, and Egypt) sacrifices a small percentage of their population (Palestinian Arabs), by herding them into a small region (because they won't let them enter into Syria or Egypt either!), and then brain washing them to repeatedly attack the more powerful country (Israel), by convincing them that they should be martyrs--that paradise awaits if they are killed while fighting ""The Zionist Occupiers""?

But to my astonishment I discovered that it has no literature. The reason is that no one exiled the people of the country. The Romans did not exile peoples and they could not have done so even if they had wanted to. They did not have trains and trucks to deport entire populations.

You don't and they won't.

&gt;. But even if they do it seems rather obvious that there will be no peace and it will start all over again in a few months/years.

That's right. The root cause must be addressed and that is the occupation.

Until the occupation is lifted there can be no peace.

&gt;The only way out is building up trust between the nations.

Palestine is not a nation. The gaza strip and the west bank are israeli occupied territories and not nations recognized by the UN, Israel, EU, or the US.

Also, when Rome took over it was, in the end, normally for the money.

The Romans made their conquests pay for themselves.  Iraq has been a drain of American power and money of colossal proportions.

The difference in the U.S. is you have a much more limited social net than in European countries, and as much as right-wing conservatives love to deride this kind of thing it does work. Also one other thing that is stronger in the U.S. is the obsession with money and material possessions, kids feel they have a right to own the newest and best of everything and if they cant go to school and get a good job to get it, well then the 'street' beckons.

i have my reasons, just as you have reasons being biased towards Russia. however it does not matter, because, i think i clearly separated my personal opinion from solid facts. if you're arguing with my personal opinion -- it is one thing, if you're arguing with facts -- it is different.

&gt; In your point #1 you claim that it is ""logical"" of Ukraine to increase its transit fees.

yep, it is. transit process involves burning some gas, so transit fees _must_ depend on gas prices. in last three years transit fees increased insignificantly (from $1.6 to $1.7 per mcm per 100km), while gas prices for Ukraine (and, well, the rest of the world) increased 2x, and now Gazprom wants it to be 2.5x. assuming that original prices were fair (Gazprom was dictating them, after all), it would be fair if they increase. here's what Naftogaz wants (gas price vs transit price per 100 km, current gas price is $179, transit price -- $1.7):

    $201 -- $1.7 (keep transit fee same up to price of $201)
    $238 -- $1.8
    $250 -- $2-2.2

seems reasonable for me. JFYI, average transit price in Europe is $7.

&gt; Why did Ukraine shutdown gas to Europe over negotiations with Russia over transit fees?

huh, did you read what i wrote at all? Ukraine did not shutdown anything, it took 10% of gas for transit purposes. i do not know, maybe it is too much, but it is clearly different from shutting down supplies. 

it is not just my opionion, it was in official announcements of Gazprom that Ukraine have stollen only some small fraction of gas and it was Gazprom who lowered the pressure.

&gt; Why didn't Ukraine keep sending gas to Europe while negotiations about transit fees continue?

because they did?

&gt; Why did you fail to mention that Russia has a contract according to which Ukraine must send gas to Europe for the next 3 years?

i thought it is not really relevant here.
 yep, indeed, they had contract that fixed transit prices for 5 years, until the end of 2010. given that prices should correlate with gas prices, this is clearly a robery from Gazprom.

contract scheme was like this -- Naftogaz gets money for transit and buys russian gas for transits technical purposes. without contract on gas supplies from Russia (another wtf why transit contract is for 5 years and supply contract is for 1 year), it could not fullfil contract -- if it cannot buy gas, it cannot keep pressure. it could burn its own reserves, but that could not last for a long time, and it made people of Ukraine vulnerable to the will of Gazprom. instead it offered alternative scheme where fraction of russian gas goes directly for transit purposes. this scheme allowed to avoid disruption of supplies during negotiations, if Gazprom accepted it. Gazprom did not..

whether or not this is a breach of contract, and what sanctions would Naftogaz will have for breaching it is another question -- this is to be decided by the arbitrage court, i'm pretty sure contract covers various points about how it can be cancelled, emergency stuff etc. actually paying for transit with gas was in previous contracts that were used until 2006, and it is actually weird that working under conditions of previous contracts while unable to fulfil conditions of current is called ""stealing"" and ""shutting down supplies"".

&gt; Why do you demand that Russia should send extra gas to Ukraine, while Ukraine in your opinion has a right to unilaterally shutdown gas transfer to Europe?

Ukraine does not have right to unilaterally shutdown gas transfer to Europe. i think it has rights to use a fraction of gas being sent for transporting purposes.

&gt; Your arguments are biased and your verbosity can't hide that.

my arguments being biases does not change the fact that it was in official announcement of Gazprom that it cuts supplies from 300 mcm to 65 mcm, and from this fact alone it is clear that it is Gazprom did shut down supplies.",True,,c06wgb2,True,0,1231404549,killerstorm,1,1,0

Even their lowered number of 82% (which is also mentioned in the article, so the reddit headline is yet again completely misleading) is extremely iffy at best. Here are some reasons why:

- They claim every player has on average 1.3 IP adresses due to dynamic IP. Seems a rather low number given the fact that every player with dynamic IP can have 30 different ones each month. Given an (rather high) estimate 30 IP adresses per month for every user with dynamic IP, that means up to 90 users would have to have static IP for every dynamic IP user. They even claim 76% of users only have one IP. I can't think of a single ISP offering static IP in their standard packages in my own or neighbouring countries here in West-Europe.

- What happens to the previous calculation when we factor in players playing from multiple pc's or laptops using public internet hotspots?

- There is no mention how many times those IPs access the score server. If a certain IP accesses only once, with a unique user ID, it is counted. So if someone lends me their game, I try it out but uninstall it after a single game, I'm counted as a pirate. This would help explain why they arrive at 76% of users with only one IP. If I have a dynamic IP adress but only play the game once, they count me as a user with only one IP adress.

- Why would a pirate knowingly enable the logging of scores unto a central score server, when said method could possibly be used to track down his IP or render his copy of the game unplayable?

Yes, anthropologists preserve culture. That's pretty much their job in the cultural respect. It also isn't museum work in most instances though anthropologists do work in some museums. Anthropologists are generally the biggest advocates of returning bodies and artifacts to their most likely descendants. It is generally anthropologists that try to preserve languages that are dying, that document rites and rituals to the best of their ability which has helped some groups celebrate their culture instead of never having known about it. There is certainly room to blame Europeans for the loss of those things in the first place but you would be burdening the entire group with guilt that isn't warranted as opposed to admitting that some people did some shitty things while many others were opposed to it.

You imply that European mistreatment and malice led to epidemics when in many cases the epidemics moved ahead of Europeans. This is actually one of the reasons why population estimates have such a wide range and are impossible to verify. Having an opinion is one thing, saying it is a fact is a whole other thing.

Population density doesn't have to be high for rapid transmission of diseases. It can aid it but so does having people move from one group to another. Especially in the case of meso-America and SW North America there were extensive land and water trade routes. Trade routes like these is pretty much the same way the Black Plague moved around Europe. It also had in a couple of cases to do with escaped livestock. The first Europeans in meso-America crossed Panama to see the Pacific ocean in 1513, another short visit in 1517 (Mayans killed most of that expedition) and the in 1519 Cortes left to conquer it. You are also completely ignoring the few Europeans that traveled over much of the continent as a precursor to later contact. Again as I mentioned earlier one of the reasons for the low end of pre-Columbian population estimates is that by the time Europeans made contact with with most groups the populations had already been wiped out by disease.

As I said Zorita exagerrated his claims. I also gave the reason for his exaggeration. The Spaniards by and large weren't ashamed of their treatment of Indians, why do you think they would try to make it seem nicer than it really was? Why does Zorita's claims overall stand in direct poorly against other accounts? Because he haad an agenda.  I didn't address the *economic exploitation* because that didn't have much to do with population decline even if you want to say it did. If you're going to drop name in the future how about you actually cite the work. It isn't my job to spin their ideas of keeping seperate cities but it is my job to know of it.

Populations decreased do to indian societies deteriorating, droughts, disease transmission and so on. These things can be shown in the archeological record. You use exceptionally high population numbers and you wonder why it's important to show population decline? Because you are trying to exaggerate the population and the later death toll due to European contact. There is a difference between the truth and your agenda. 

It was a word used to describe a hemoraghic fever that was mistaken to be small pox originally. The fever is believed to be of New World origin. I think it was still the Nahuatl word for disease back then. I'm guessing you consider yourself Nahuatl? Anyways in 1545 cocoliztli is believed to be responsible for killing 80% of the estimated 6.5 million and a later cocoliztli  epidemic in 1576 was responsible for killing 45% of the estimated 4.4 million. Common traits were that it generally killed within 7 days, would be jaundiced and bleed from nose, mouth and ears. *The fevers were contagious, burning, and continuous, all of them pestilential, in most part lethal. The tongue was dry and black. Enormous thirst. Urine of the colors sea-green, vegetal-green, and black, sometimes passing from the greenish color to the pale.* - Dr. Francisco Hernández Chief physician of New Spain

You're right. I had you confused with someone who's argument sounds similar. I'm not sure if slavery was thought of as violence or not but would agree with that suggestion. However in the case of the Aztec and Mayan empires especially they existed before contact as as states that derived tribute from their empires which is also one of the reasons why disease would have spread so quickly because a lot of goods were being transported.

The natives overall could not expect to be free. In almost all instances societies were highly stratified with the masses being at best equivalent to European serfdom. My argument has nothing to do with how perfect it was or wasn't but to dispel myths commonly held in regards to the European conquest of the Americas.

Animal domestication did in fact happen in the New World, dogs, ducks, turkeys, deer and a few other animals were common domesticates through much of the New World though South America did in fact domesticate various species of llamas. The producers in the Old and New Worlds didn't tend to have first access to the goods unless they wanted severe punisment. This isn't applicable to all cultures I suppose but that tends to have more to do with how different cultures tried to subjugate surrounding cultures. The Aztecs actually did have some extensive trade routes and if I remember right a number of goods produced in South America have been found in Aztec ruins and I know for certain that green obsidian from Pachuca has been found in what is now the SW USA. They walked the goods when needed and used canoes when they could.

The economy grew by 8% in the last quarter of 2006, the fastest growth of any Western nation.[4]

The major industrial sectors include metal products, electronic and biomedical equipment, processed foods, chemicals, and transport equipment.

I have never met an indian that didn't have some animosity for anthropologists, or at best, didn't care for them, and I've had the pleasure of getting to know many ethnicities in Mexico. Linguists have a much better reputation.

Your focusing solely on the first epidemics, but they were a cyclical phenomenon. The largest ones were certainly around the time of First Contact, and some of these were never witnessed by Europeans, but Europeans certainly experienced the latter ones. The correlation of agricultural crisis and plagues is well established and the contemporaries I cited believed that the Colonizers (not always European anymore) aggravated their mortality rate due to their exploitation of Indian, which is also undisputed. The first colonial Cities were build within a few years of the Conquest, by slaves that survived the first plagues only to succumb to the Spanish whip.

Now some diseases seem to have jumped from Mesoamerica to the Andean region, two regions that do not seem to have traded. Trade and distribution of tribute certainly were factors elsewhere in the Americas, but during the Black Death in Europe those living in less dense areas survived. Just look at a map of Switzerland and see all the little towns, established around that time as a response to the Death. The speed at which the diseases spread anywhere is a good indicator of population density, that's just first year medicine.

No, you said Zorita arrived ""after disease devastated the natives"", which is incorrect, as anyone living in Mesoamerica at that time for more than a few years would have experienced them. His quote didn't sound particularly exaggerated, even if other claims were but those are irrelevant, everyone has a agenda. The basis of my argument, which you admit you don't address, is that economic exploitation worsened the plagues and hence led to a population decline. You just say ""that [it ]didn't have much to do"", essentially the Stalin and Mao apologists argument.

Because you are trying to exaggerate the population and the later death toll due to European contact. There is a difference between the truth and your agenda.

I have never gave my population estimates. I don't even know if I have one. Certainly more then 10-20 million. Probably less than 100  million, and maybe even half of that. It doesn't really difference, when you consider that the survivors and descendants had to deal with the same plagues and oppression for another 500 years, not due to ""European contact"" as you say, but to ""European occupation"". You mention 7.18 million dead more than 20 years after the Conquest for just two epidemics of just one disease. How many died total after the Conquest? 20? 40? 100 million? Nahuatl was my first language, but my town is almost completely Latinized and hence don't think of myself as Nahua (or Purepecha).

The life of the macehual was harsh, but to compare them to serfs is ridiculous. You ignore the lack of practical elements of oppression in Mesoamerica. An escaped serf could expect to be cut down with a sword on horseback paid for by capital, greatly dissuading them to rise up. A macehual didn't live in a world were metal, horses or capital existed and that led to a more ""fair"" distribution of resources in the hope of appeasing them. The differences between the social classes were less and more fluid, and the organization of the calpulli more or less show this. Obviously all cultures try to subjugate others, but the magnitude and fluidity of the subjugation is intrinsically connected to their abilities to actually do so, and these abilities were vastly different in Mesoamerica and even more so in the rest of North America.

Dogs were brought from Asia. Muscovy ducks and turkeys were recently domesticated, but might also just have been tamed and with genetic drift still occurring regularly between the wild and domesticated species. I've never heard of deer domesticated, maybe tamed, but that's different. Guinea pigs and cameloids were domesticated in South America, but never seem to have made it out of the Andes.

Well, I'm far from being an expert in the subject of urban warfare but it seems to me that the tactics of getting around human sheild involves more danger to the Israeli forces. It's easier to blow up a building than to try to take out the bad guy with a bullet.

Also, let's say it is a fact Hamas uses human shields. Let's assume they try to do everything to have civilians around them at all times. The Israeli army knows this. So, you can accuse them all you can, but you're still dropping the bombs on the human shields. A dead woman or child is still dead no matter what amount of words you use to describe how bad Hamas is.

Analogies are never perfect but: terrorists using human shields is like having terrorists seize a building in US our Europe and take a number of hostages. Now, do you deal with the terrorists by blowing up the building, which takes care of the terrorists for sure, but with the unfortunate side effect of killing hostages?

There is no way, using the tactics Israeli do, Hamas militants being where they are, that loss of civilian life could be avoided. Civilians dying is a consequence Israel has accepted when they went to this war. More civilians dying is a consequence Israel accepts if it has proof that Hamas is using human shields and still continues to drop the bombs. 

Another (silly) analogy: you're blindfolded shooting with a gun to one direction. You know for a fact that a bad guy will try to put a woman or a child in the line of fire.

&gt;Another problem is that they're setting up an ecological disaster by planting the same species throughout a deforested area. When an entire forest is all made of the same species of tree, and they're all the same age, it becomes an irresistible treat for tree-eating caterpillars, beetles, and fungi, as we've seen in numerous forests in North America and Europe.

&gt;Taking thousands of tons of biomass (fully grown trees and habitat) out of a forest and replacing it with saplings that weigh a few ounces will do little for the downwind areas that need the atmospheric moisture to produce rainfall.

Before fully answering, a few assumptions. First, technology has vanished, but not those with knowledge of it. Next, there are still raw materials from which to build. Also, the nations' populations are still in tact. And language is not considered part of the man-made goods; we can still speak.

Assuming we still knew language as we do today, we already have a huge advantage over our ancestors. Being able to communicate facilitates trade. Trade builds communities, and can link together those who still remember technology. Their wealth of knowledge would only benefit the first generation. As they die, no amount of books will make sense to their children.

Following generations would possibly be able to reference libraries of passed-down knowledge on the once plentiful artifacts . They might began to attribute some mythical value to them. If that happens, there will be a undetermined dark age where such advanced things are either feared or jealously guarded. One could expect the world to return to its current state in a span of 2100 - 2500 years, depending on what the first few generations managed to accomplish.

Those first people may fall victim to the mass death of people. If many skilled laborers and scientists die, then this would affect how quickly things progress. After that, it depends on language and trade. It worked for the Sumerian and Indus valley civilizations. Since we already have language, and trade can begin immediately, I adjust it to 1200-1700 years.

Given the distribution of livestock around the world now, there are no places held back by a lack of proper protein sources. With enough adequate food sources, fewer people are needed for farming, which allows trade jobs to become feasible, and technological advancement to occur. That means places like north America, which was originally mostly devoid of plant-able crops, now can yield higher energy wheat and other grains (native to central Asia). But, it is likely such food will be scarce, due to The population problems. In either case, the flora and fauna are in place, which will help. So, we can reduce it to 700-900 years since we already have evolved crops with larger fruit and seeds.

Finally, and most importantly, is fuel. Our technological advances came along with more easily found and exploited fuel sources. One did not have to dig far to strike oil or find coal. Given the lengths we currently go through today to get these fuels, it may not be accurate to say that such a rapid buildup of technology could happen as it did in the late 19th century. It could be said that without our current technology, we could have a base of tools and know-how to put us on par wiTh 15Th or 16th century Europe by the first generation. But, there would not be the same type of industrial revolution; coal and oil are just too far away now.

With that penalty, I would expect a time table spanning one thousand years or so. Until those fuel sources can be rediscovered and extracted, we won't have the power to fuel a industrial boom.

Chomsky: What's talked about in Europe is something quite different. In Europe, there's a large Muslim population, and much of it has been driven to fundamentalist Islam. They display hatred towards Jews that is a reflection of Israeli practices. I mean, if you carry out a brutal and vicious occupation for thirty-five years, subject the people to humiliation and degradation, break their bones and steal their land and resources, it has consequences. Sometimes the consequences can be quite ugly and among them is the burning of synagogues in France. Yes, it's anti-Semitism. But Israel insists on it. Remember, Israel does not call itself the state of its citizens. The high court in Israel declared over forty years ago that Israel is the sovereign state of the Jewish people in Israel and the Diaspora. That means Israel is my sovereign state, but it's not the sovereign state of its Palestinian citizens. Well, if that's what you declare yourself to be, then you can hardly blame critics of Israeli policy for having negative attitudes towards Jews. After all, it's my sovereign state-why shouldn't they go after me? This is one of many respects in which insisting on a state that is fundamentally racist in its basic character and declares itself to be the state of Jews everywhere is harmful to Jews.

The nation which indulges towards another a habitual hatred or a habitual fondness is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its animosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation against another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable, when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. Hence, frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. The nation, prompted by ill-will and resentment, sometimes impels to war the government, contrary to the best calculations of policy. The government sometimes participates in the national propensity, and adopts through passion what reason would reject; at other times it makes the animosity of the nation subservient to projects of hostility instigated by pride, ambition, and other sinister and pernicious motives. The peace often, sometimes perhaps the liberty, of nations, has been the victim.

So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification. It leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of privileges denied to others which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the concessions; by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been retained, and by exciting jealousy, ill-will, and a disposition to retaliate, in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld. And it gives to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citizens (who devote themselves to the favorite nation), facility to betray or sacrifice the interests of their own country, without odium, sometimes even with popularity; gilding, with the appearances of a virtuous sense of obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, corruption, or infatuation.

As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent patriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic factions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, to influence or awe the public councils 7 Such an attachment of a small or weak towards a great and powerful nation dooms the former to be the satellite of the latter.

Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But that jealousy to be useful must be impartial; else it becomes the instrument of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defense against it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive dislike of another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on one side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots who may resist the intrigues of the favorite are liable to become suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence of the people, to surrender their interests.

The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is in extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little political connection as possible. So far as we have already formed engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us stop. Europe has a set of primary interests which to us have none; or a very remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics, or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities.",False,,c06wvq1,True,0,1231449500,metrofeed,3,3,0

It *should* represent them but that does not mean if they fail one should feel a duty to not speak out. Is something sinister going on? I'd say yes.  Does that mean you should start spying on your Israeli co-workers?  No.

You've told me you're American.  The actions of the Bush Administration have been criminal, imperialistic and private-venture orientated IMO.  Does that mean I judge all Americans, you included, as being the same.  I don't see one as being indicative of the other.  I have no right to judge you.

For the record I am British and served in the Army.  Trust me I am just as critical as the British government (in fact more so - they've just escaped the spot light in the main) and I am fully aware of the f-ckups, the near f-ckups and the downright stupidity of some that can go hand in hand with sheer expertise, humanity and professionalism of those I once served with.  So could this have just been one monster screw up by some kid, intentionally malicious or not, that goes no higher?  Yes.

Unfortunately it doesn't end there.  Despite early attempts by the media Israel started the escalation.  Even prior to that it failed to meet ceasefire agreements despite evidence that Hamas had tried to.  Prior to the escalation Israeli intelligence themselves state that there was no direct Hamas link to militant action (they did it by proxy - not to make excuses).  I know America had designated Hamas a terrorist organisation but bare this in mind: Australia and the UK both had not.  They had identified a militant wing associated to Hamas (just as they had with Fatah - and western media are now telling us they are the moderates even though their militant wing is very much active) as terrorists but not the diplomatic aspect.  They differentiated to further the prospect of diplomacy.  But what do we see now?  The media is portraying that Hamas is responsible for all rockets out of Gaza.  That is simply not the case - every intelligence agency if you catch them before either the government or the media say exactly the same thing.  There are other groups operating in Palestine launching rockets - putting Hamas as the umbrella for all (without making Hamas to be without fault) is not accurate in the least and yet there is an organised effort to make it just so.

So is something sinister going on?  I'd say yes.  But don't feel bad or that you have to stigmatise all Israelis or Jews with it.  Did you blame all Americans when you thought the Neocons were a piece of sh*t?  [Same concept](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Zionism).
At the Annapolis peace talks organised by the American government Hamas wasn't even invited!!  How can you have peace talks and not invite one of the democratically elected (both UN and EU observers testified that the election was fair, properly carried out and above board)  parties which you're attacking in Gaza whilst inviting their rivals (fatah) in the West Bank?  International bodies, Israeli academics and Palestinians all protested this at the time.  Since then even Israel's PM Olmert has admitted in a more candid moment that the peace talks, if they were to be successful, had to include Hamas. And yet between the trio of US, Israel and Fatah Hamas was never invited.  Now we see a determined effort to make them culpable for everything to justify war even though the world's intelligence services, including the UK and Israel, nearly all reluctantly admit that that is not the case.

If you'll note from that link post zionism doesn't want to make it about religion, want to respect the greenline borders (1947).  The head of Hamas has since said that it would even be willing to recognise Israel under such conditions!  [AND SO DID THE 22 STATE ARAB LEAGUE!](http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-07-25-mideast_N.htm) (for the record the Israeli government rejected it) but all the while **it would be unfair for people to not recognise the great number of Israeli people who do denounce the escalation, do condemn the war, do speak out about the Palestinian humanitarian crisis (b'tselem), do have the courage or the conviction to refuse to serve in either the forces or the Occupied territories (yesg gvul)and do talk about both aspects in the media (typically Haaretz).**

The short of it is, don't be afraid to criticise the Israeli government, their actions or those that support it (same goes for Palestine Authorities) and think that in some way you can't at the same time support both the Israeli and Palestinian people.  You can.

The most applicable non-EE figures I found were a self discharge of ~ 3% / day.   A trip from iceland to norway is about 600 miles across some of the worst seas there are.  Figure a fast ship might get you there in a good day.  Yah, that  might work if there was not the energy density problem. 

 
There is a company called eestor that announced some ceramic cool new hotness... but nothing public has been seen from them beyond PR releases.

Make of it what you choose.  Even at best, eestor devices would store 1/10th the recoverable engergy from fossil fuels (per kg).  So 10 battery ships vs 1 coal ship...  charging a battery ship would need to be very cheap to make the economics work out. 

Then there is the question of economics.  At $40 / kWh (that thing that costs $0.01 in Iceland, and sells for $0.05 in europe (maybe).  So at $0.04 profit per 2 days (it'll take a day to get back to Iceland) So you'll maybe get 365/2 (haha, winter is a bad bad thing up north.)  Just to pay for the storage you'll need to work for 5.5 years.  Not to mention the leakage current, dock time, bad weather, buying and crewing the ship, etc, etc, etc.  This is not a good bet currently, or in the foreseeable future.  Sad that.

If I was focusing on the first epidemics I wouldn't have referenced more than one epidemic. The first hit the hardest and all the others also hit pretty damn hard. When a series of epidemics kills off 80%, 80% and then 40% that is a gigantic number that you keep trying to pin on everything else. Correlation does NOT equal causation no matter how many times you try to imply that it does. There were pyramids being built in South America and Egypt at the same time yet I think we'd both agree that would be a poor example of correlation. Do you know why a drought might cause a spread and increase in disease? A big reason is that people have to leave the area to find another place with more resources. Any disease that person had now gets passed on to another population group. What the hell are you even trying to argue with that anyways?


So why were the Incans growing corn? Probably for the same reason that it was grown over most of the New World. Because there were very extensive trade networks. Aztec and Incan cultures may never have traded directly but through intermediaries. It's intellectually dishonest to act as though there was no exchange. The Aztecs traded as far north as modern day USA and as far south as modern day Columbia. At least part of Columbia was part of the Incan empire.


Actually a lot of people who had ancestors that possessed genetic immunities to small pox also found themselves immune to the plague in Europe.  That same immunity also provides an immunity to common strains of HIV/AIDS for some people as well. Cities large and small were also very proactive about setting up quarantines after they started figuring out more about the way it was spreading. In some cases town quarantined themselves after they were infected to prevent spreading of the plague. Now considering that the plague spread along trade routes and very likely originated from China why do you think it was spread because of population density? Certainly the more densely a city is populated the more people would contract it however that has little to do with how fast it spread throughout Europe and yet another thing to consider is that the plague generally killed people within 2-3 days of contracting it. Most European cities at the time of that plague had 1,000 or fewer people though a small handful did have 50,000 or more.


By 1520 (Zorita was about 8 years old at this point of time, was he writing about the errors of Europeans in the New World when he was 8?) at least one smallpox epidemic had devastated Mexico killing as many as perhaps 50% of the inhabitants at the time with at least one more large epidemic moving through the area in 1531 (most likely measles). Zorita arrived in 1547. There were other major epidemics besides the two I mentioned but I really only need one to show you as wrong. You are also trying to draw a pretty lame comparison between Stalin, Mao and myself. The reason it didn't have much to do with it is because the groups had been experiencing *economic exploitation* since before any Europeans had come to the New World. This is how larger societies in the New World supported themselves. The only difference between the cultures of the New World and Old World is that the benefactors became Europeans instead of the Aztec or Inca and those goods may have been shipped to a different city. It was a condition that existed, in a more severe form no doubt before contact, thus its impact would be minimal which is not the same as beneficial. You are blaming Europeans for what the natives did in pre-Columbian times.

You’ve twice agreed with the 70million figure or close to it anyways. I’m not trying to defend in any way what happened due to European contact or occupation. What I am trying to do is show that many horrible things that happened were incidental rather than purposeful. You on the other hand seem to want to imply that the majority of deaths were purposeful and that every European that came over was trying to make life a living hell for the natives. 

Macehual worked for the state and had very few opportunities to escape that burden. You can replace macehual with serf and it would still be an accurate statement. Aztec slaves were often lumped into the same social class as the macehual. They didn’t live in a world with steel (though they did make some tools out of copper)or iron or horses though they certainly made use of copper and had capital it just wasn’t in the form of money.
Calpulli? I’m sorry but you seem to be making a strange argument here. There were what 10-20 calpulli for the largest Aztec city Tenochtitlan? The Aztecs built their empire on the subjugation of other people. That’s how they supported themselves and had the labor to feed the empire.
Dogs came from Asia in the same way the Aztecs came from Asia. Muscovy ducks had been domesticated at least a few centuries before any European contact and before Aztecs really blossomed as a culture. Turkey had been domesticated in most of the Americas by different groups at different times. De Soto noted pens of domesticated deer in Florida and other Spaniards noted domesticated deer in Mesoamerica, especially in the Yucatan peninsula by Mayans. I think you may be using an odd definition of domestication.
Lacking analytical thought? I’m sorry but when all signs point to something and you say they point somewhere else the issue is with you not with everything else.

No Arab country can defeat Israel militarily -in a classic conventional war, although they were close to doing that in 1973 but the nuclear options was the threat that reversed their victories, when the US and UK in addition to other European countries, came to Israel rescue in several ways. The only way to stop Israeli occupation is by Palestinian resistance. This is how Lebanon librated its south that was occupied by Israel, this how Algeria, Morocco and many others achieved their independence. Although it is easy to dismiss Hamas' capabilities with its home made rockets, but it is the only option left to stop the Israeli occupation and blockade that have been killing Palestinians by starvation, lack of medication and medical treatment.
Hamas has a religious Islamic background yet still it is a popular resistance movement. The IDF, even Israel, is a religious thing, so nothing wrong with that although in the case of Israel it is a racist religious state. Hamas reached power by democratic means, so did Israeli terrorists. So how come Israel is allowed to play with its religion and have terrorist as their leaders while deny Hamas the same? So many people are misguided when they say Hamas rule was similar to Taliban, because there can never be any proper government under occupation.
Yes, they claim they left Gaza according to Oslo agreement but they have not left when they can make Gaza a large prison when they control everything and assassinate any one any time. When Hamas was in power they did not behave like Taliban there were still casinos, clubs and they never tried to impose any religious code on people neither in Gaza no in the West Bank .
All decent people on earth, and mainly Americans, who believe in freedom should support Hamas struggle to achieve liberty from the longest and nastiest occupation in history. To those who are using Hamas' links to Iran, I think it was unfortunately the only country to support Hamas after Rice ordered all Middle Eastern dictators to shut up and keep away. Hamas would be willing to seek US support and ditch its Iranian connections. Hamas is desperate for any support and when Iran offered it, no one in Hamas position can say no to the offer. Had the US, Europe or any other country gave support to end the occupation and support resistance, Hamas and other Palestinian resistance movement would have worked with them.
Palestinians have tried the peaceful negotiations option several times but Israel acted like a cunning poker player who can not win unless by cheating. Hamas' rocket are terrorist acts, but that was in response to the daily terror of occupation who are getting away with it even though it kills silently- slow collective ethnic cleansing. Hamas' rocket are wrong and I have always ridiculed them for them but they seem to be symbols of refusal to die and desperate acts for life and freedom.
I am an Arab who crossed the bridge between the east and the west, and I have realized the human values developed thanks the west, yet my admiration will not stop me from calling a spade a spade. 
The west has developed the most civilized human values of freedom and democracy, yet I feel sick when Bush is more concerned on his dead cat when hundreds of Palestinian innocent children , men and women are savagely killed with US weapons.

And Western inaction to the Massacres in GAZA is shameful and intolerable. So alternately, please support Hamas.

Deliveries also dropped sharply as the leading US exporter was hit by an eight-week strike by its assembly workers during the autumn, allowing Airbus, the rival European aircraft maker, to re-establish its leadership of the global commercial aerospace industry.

Airbus, part of EADS, the leading European aerospace and defence group, will announce its full-year numbers next week, but already by the end of November it had surpassed both the orders and delivery totals reached by Boeing for the full year.

The US group, led by Jim McNerney, chief executive, has suffered a year of serious setbacks in its commercial aircraft operations, as the long period of industrial strife added to the embarrassing and increasingly costly delays in two of its flagship new aircraft development programmes.

Boeing said yesterday its net new commercial aircraft orders had fallen by 53 per cent last year to 662, from the record 1,413 achieved in 2007. Boeing had previously achieved three record years with net new orders of 1,044 in 2006 and 1,002 in 2005.

It said yesterday the 2008 orders total was the eighth highest in its history, but demand from airlines around the world is falling fast amid the deepening recession and the credit crunch, and orders are expected to plunge again this year.

Boeing said its deliveries had fallen by 15 per cent last year from 441 to 375. Airbus has previously forecast its deliveries would exceed 470 in 2008, a new peak and up from 453 in 2007.

Boeing was forced to announce last month the fourth set of delays for its 787 Dreamliner long-haul jet, postponing initial deliveries to the first quarter of 2010, a delay of nearly two years.

Beset by parts shortages, design problems and incomplete work by its suppliers, the 787 was originally planned to arrive in service in May last year.

Boeing has delayed the first test flight, originally due in the late of summer of 2007 to the second quarter this year. Virgin Atlantic, the UK long-haul carrier controlled by Sir Richard Branson, said yesterday it had been informed by Boeing its first 787 deliveries would be about two and a half years late and were due in the third quarter of 2013 instead of March/April 2011.

Like many other carriers hit by the 787 development problems, Virgin Atlantic said it was in talks with Boeing, Airbus and aircraft lessors about interim solutions and alternative orders to allow it further capacity growth in the next few years.

Boeing's development of the 747-8, a stretched version of its venerable 747 jumbo, has also been delayed by over-stretched engineering resources, supply chain problems and design changes with first delivery of the freighter version recently put back by almost a year from late 2009 to the third quarter of 2010.",False,,c06xcv8,True,0,1231497840,silence_hr,0,0,0

As a field, anthropology has potential, but like many alchemy before it, its foundation is still too linked to a biased world view. Comments like you accusing me of being a ""white-guilt laden college student more than an Indian"" shows you yourself aren't free of it. Why can't an indian be an annoyed college student? Have you ever even met indians or realized that indians have actual lives, aspirations and reasoning and might not walk around all day thinking ""wow, I'm an indian""? Some linguists are anthropologists, but certainly not all.

I think I was quite clear in my first post that the plagues were the direct cause of the deaths. I am correlating the Colonial-policy-induced agricultural crisis and exploitation with the plagues. Europeans *caused* the severe economc exploitation and slavery and their policies *caused* the severe agricultural crises, which led to famine. And both of these are correlated to the plagues. I think you're just not understanding or I am not being clear here. Look at the example of the Irish Potato Famine. The direct cause was the blight, but it was British agricultural policy that cause the severe famine. I've already mentioned two similar examples.

&gt;So why were the Incans growing corn? Probably for the same reason that it was grown over most of the New World. Because there were very extensive trade networks. Aztec and Incan cultures may never have traded directly but through intermediaries. It's intellectually dishonest to act as though there was no exchange. The Aztecs traded as far north as modern day USA and as far south as modern day Columbia. At least part of Columbia was part of the Incan empire.

That the Andeans were growing corn is your proof that there was trade, even indirect, with Mesoamerica? I guess that there was trade too with the Polynesians because they were growing sweet potato! The Darien gap separates North and South America, making trade very difficult. I don't doubt some commodities made it through once in a while, but I am not sure I would call that trade, and certainly not a trade network.

Population density is a factor, not a requisite, for plague spread, I am sorry if I didn't make it clear. In more dense areas, it will spread faster, while in less dense ones, slower, until reaching a point where it doesn't spread. And again, those comparisons with the Old World fall to the logic trap of transport. It is much easier to have long distance trade with horses and cattle than with just people.

&gt; By 1520 (Zorita was about 8 years old at this point of time, was he writing about the errors of Europeans in the New World when he was 8?) at least one smallpox epidemic had devastated Mexico killing as many as perhaps 50% of the inhabitants at the time with at least one more large epidemic moving through the area in 1531 (most likely measles). Zorita arrived in 1547. There were other major epidemics besides the two I mentioned but I really only need one to show you as wrong. You are also trying to draw a pretty lame comparison between Stalin, Mao and myself. The reason it didn't have much to do with it is because the groups had been experiencing economic exploitation since before any Europeans had come to the New World. This is how larger societies in the New World supported themselves. The only difference between the cultures of the New World and Old World is that the benefactors became Europeans instead of the Aztec or Inca and those goods may have been shipped to a different city. It was a condition that existed, in a more severe form no doubt before contact, thus its impact would be minimal which is not the same as beneficial. You are blaming Europeans for what the natives did in pre-Columbian times.

I am not sure what you're trying to ""prove"" here. Do you think that the plagues stopped in 1547? All through Colonial times epidemics wiped out large percentages of the native population and Colonial policies can be linked to them. Even by 1531, the foundations of the colonial cities were already being built with slave labor and alien products like cattle and wheat imposed on people. Economic exploitation existed before the Europeans, just like it did in the Ukraine and China before Stalin and Mao, but its magnitude and severity increased substantially in all three cases. Europeans came and took previously productive land for them, their cattle and wheat (a much less efficient crop than maize), enslaved indians for their mines and city-works, all while prohibiting them adopting European techniques and methods, like riding horse. Even IF they had demanded the same amount of tribute as in pre-Columbian times, less people working less land meant they had to work much more.

I never said or thought ""every European that came over was trying to make life a living hell for the natives"", that's you. If you're just trying to prove that many of the ""horrible things"" were just incidental, then you failed. Perhaps some were incidental but evidence points to people being aware even back then that most were far from incidental and driven by greed and the desire for power. You might not be trying to defend imperialism and genocide, but you certainly make seem much less worse than it was.

Last points: Capital the word is derived from the world for cattle. Wealth existed in pre-Columbian Mexico, but it was largely perishable and mean capitalism and capital could not ""increase"". The dynamics of their economic system where therefore vastly different from those of the Old World. The term calpulli is used for the smallest non-family subdivision of society, which extended beyond cities, and their structure is well understood and serfdom it was not. A tame animal is an individual or a group of individuals from a normally wild species that has become accustomed to humans, while a domesticated animal is a new species that had been selectively bred by humans from a tame population. Do Muscovy ducks and Turkeys fall into one or the other? Evidence points to both, since modern breeds were created much later. Tame deer (or elephants) are not domesticated though.

1. It's deeply patronising to suggest we have a duty to spend money or do something really want to, in order to keep an economy going. What's laissez-faire about taxing savings, for instance?
2. Once the prices fall to the right level spending will start by itself, provided people have enough money and their prospects are good enough.
3. There has been a lot of redistribution from normal classes to rich in by means of company profits. There has been an ever growing gap between productivity and pay, which meant the consumers have had to borrow heavily in order to keep up a lifestyle they wanted, and obviously borrowing cannot go on indefinitely. I'd venture to suggest if the gap was smaller, i.e. pay was better matched to productivity, i.e. companies hadn't been so greedy in the first place, we wouldn't be in quite such a mess.
4. How has the UK managed its money better than, say, Germany?

Anthropologists are not generally in favor of kidnapping culture. It is contrary to what we do and why we do it. It is in fact one of the reasons why osteological remains are studied is because we can in many cases tell where they came from and return them.

Language is culture thus one who studies language studies culture. Only recently have people started to create divisions in it for whatever reasons.

&gt;I am correlating the Colonial-policy-induced agricultural crisis and exploitation with the plagues. Europeans caused the severe economc exploitation and slavery and their policies caused the severe agricultural crises, which led to famine. And both of these are correlated to the plagues. I think you're just not understanding or I am not being clear here. Look at the example of the Irish Potato Famine. The direct cause was the blight, but it was British agricultural policy that cause the severe famine. I've already mentioned two similar examples.

The groups hit by these famines were already being exploited by the natives. This is how the Aztecs especially supported themselves. As I said before the Europeans simply became the new benefactors of it. There were also environmental issues that occur every so often which helped worsen the famine. Surely you aren't suggesting that Spaniards were the cause of droughts? This has little to do with the Irish Potato Famine. That came about because potatos were the best mass food option at the time and a disease wiped them out. To relate this to anything in the Americas would have to involve maize crops dying off due to disease or infestation.

The Darien gap is a modern impediment, difficult to build roads and a lot of guerrillas as well as worry of environmental impact. Polynesians got sweet potatoes according to popular theories by actually travelling to South America and going back with them. Polynesians are pretty well know to have travelled extensively by boat. You are trying to create doubt where there is none. Meanwhile Aztec trading areas and the extent of the Incan  empire either overlapped or came very close. I do see the point you are trying to make but corn was brought there over land or via canoe. Aztecs are documented to have traded down io Ecuador, Ecuador being a part of the Incan empire. Both the Aztecs and Incans were known for having long distance runners able to cover something like 200 miles a day.

I'm wondering why you are still denying that many cultures in the New World had long and extensive trading routes. You just seem to want to harp on population density damn everything else. How fast a disease spreads also has more to do with how resistant a group is to the disease and how fast it will bring on death. If something kills within a day it won't spread far more than likely unless it can be carried by people who are resistant to it. You also assume all or most travel done in Europe was done by horse or cattle.

&gt;I am not sure what you're trying to ""prove"" here. Do you think that the plagues stopped in 1547? All through Colonial times epidemics wiped out large percentages of the native population and Colonial policies can be linked to them.

First I did not imply that eopidemics ceased. I said Zorita *had arrived on the scene after disease devastated the natives, not before,* which is accurate and does not imply that disease ceased. Catholic missionaries tried replacing corn with wheat due to the religious signifigance corn for the natives.

Spaniards did what the Aztecs did. They didn't *take land* they ruled it and benefitted from it and they did it to a similar degree except that there were now fewer Aztecs due to their susceptability to diseases.

&gt;I never said or thought ""every European that came over was trying to make life a living hell for the natives"", that's you. If you're just trying to prove that many of the ""horrible things"" were just incidental, then you failed. Perhaps some were incidental but evidence points to people being aware even back then that most were far from incidental and driven by greed and the desire for power. You might not be trying to defend imperialism and genocide, but you certainly make seem much less worse than it was.

You may not be saying that outright but pretty much everything you've posted is screaming it. You got indignant at the mere mention that someone's numbers were a pretty high estimate and since then you have been contradicting pretty much every historical and archeological record. Yes I'm sure you can show that Spaniards gave measles and small pox to the natives to make it easier to conquer. Spanish greed dictated they gave the Aztecs the cold. I'm not making it seem more or less worse than it was. I'm trying to convey what happened.

&gt;Last points: Capital the word is derived from the world for cattle. Wealth existed in pre-Columbian Mexico, but it was largely perishable and mean capitalism and capital could not ""increase"". The dynamics of their economic system where therefore vastly different from those of the Old World.

So you default to a weak semantic argument? You act like their wealth was nothing more than perishable goods. The dynamics were the same. They used military power to exploit weaker neighbors and extract tribute.

&gt;The term calpulli is used for the smallest non-family subdivision of society, which extended beyond cities, and their structure is well understood and serfdom it was not.

I didn't say calpulli were serfs. A calpulli may have existed between cities but I can't think of any. They were based on a city. It would be more like a city  commission of families which I admit is not the best analogy though it is more accurate than what you wrote. I assume it is used differently in modern usage.

I suppose that some anthropologists are trying to make up for previous errors, but just because those are just now realizing that natives should be treated as equals doesn't mean that the field is still tainted, regardless of whatever justifications they try to come up with.

I don't care or want you to feel bad, I'm just surprised you refuse to accept logical arguments and insist on repeating unfounded arguments. We could be discussing aborigines in Australia, Palestinians, Irish, Celts, whatever, the mechanisms of imperialism are all very similar.

Language is just a ""protocol"" for human interaction, and can stand separate from culture as an abstract concept. That's why linguistics is now (finally) seen as independent of anthropology.

Let me repeat it for you: It is manifest that groups lived in a state of exploitation in pre-Cortesian times, period. It is also argued (not just by me) that the arrival of Europeans increased the magnitude and intensity of the exploitation these people suffered. The mechanisms that led to this change were many, but some were the usage of prime land, horses and beasts of burden, iron and steel tools, guns, etc by the oppressors, which the oppressed groups lacked and had never experienced. Ireland exported food during the blight worsening the famine, in much the same way Colonial authorities exported metals, food and used prime land during the droughts.

The Darien gap is an impediment, otherwise why would fauna so different on side and on the other? It might not be night and day different, but it proves it is an impediment, like the Andes. The gap increased the costs of trade, making it less profitable. Obviously Polynesians got their sweet potatoes from South America, but that doesn't mean that traded existed between the two. Incidents were more substantial between Mesoamerica and the Andes, but how can that be construed as being extensive trade routes. I am not disputing other trade routes, just that one. I have ever heard of proof of Aztecs trading down to Ecuador, I just think you're either making it up, or confusing it with the supposed link between Purepecha and Ecuadorian indians. 

Are you making the claim that disease devastated the native only once? Zorita just saw further devastation, and the devastation due to epidemics continued until the end of the Colony. My argument is that those epidemics had higher rates of mortality because of Colonial policies.

&gt; Spaniards did what the Aztecs did. They didn't take land they ruled it and benefitted from it and they did it to a similar degree except that there were now fewer Aztecs due to their susceptability to diseases.

Dude, honestly, you're smoking crack. Are you seriously arguing Aztecs had huge ranches of prime crop land devoted to cattle? Or that they created mines like those in Guanajuato and Potosi with their terribly high rates of mortality? Or that they prohibited key crops due to their religious bigotry? That doesn't mean all Spanish or Europeans were responsible for these actions, but these policies existed for a fact, and very soon after the Conquest. Honestly, you're no better than those Holocaust deniers.

OK, you're basically agreeing with me. ""The Aztecs used military power to exploit weaker neighbors and extract tribute."" True. The Spanish defeated the Aztecs thereby proving themselves to have more military power. Then they used said superior military power to do continue exploiting the oppressed. How can it not have been a more oppressive environment?

Calpulli as a concept existed beyond the cities and Nahuatl-phone areas. Small towns and villages, even outside of the Triple Alliance were organized in the same way.

No, it is the correct definition of domestication. If a ""domesticated muscovy duck"" is the same as a ""wild muscovy duck"", then it is a tame duck, not a domesticated duck. A dog can interbreed with a wolf, but that doesn't make it the same species, anymore than a lion and a tiger are the same species just because they can interbreed.

i have never read so much rubbish written by 'armchair generals' in all my life. I was watching the BBC news before and it had a british colonel on and he was saying in the HISTORY OF WARFARE no country has ever taken as many steps to PREVENT human casualties as israel have done in this war. Less than 1000 dead and all you left wing do-gooders are complaining. Where was the complaining in WW2 when 200,000 japs died in tokyo in one night of bombing (more than the atomic strikes!), where was the outrage when us the british decided to bomb german cities before they bombed ours, where was the outrage when millions of russians died during the siege of stalingrad????
you see my point?!

it is clear as anything that 1000 deaths is a tiny amount when a country is at war. us brits are famous for our 'courage and sense of humour during the Blitz and these arabs are hiding like rats behind their PR. The Hamastans elected ie chose a party who wanted an outright war with its neighbour and finally when it comes they whinge and cry and have you noticed there is always a Sonymini-cam nearby ;o)

In any other war in the history of mankind the winning power would have destroyed the whole of Hamistan by now but israel is fighting with one hand behind its back cos of all the left wing do gooders and shoe throwers...lol

if i was israel i would use bigger bombs, carpet bomb the fuckers. Ever noticed that israel aint attacking the West Bank as they dont want war. you reap what you sow...

thank you...

ps. if Israel falls to Islam fanatics, Europe will be next. Israel is on the frontline with the war against Iran and the spread of fanatical Islam. Now is time to choose whose side you're on cos if there is gonna be a 3rd world war it will be with the US, Europe, India and israel vs Islam.

Here's a great review, the author is not a religious person:

&gt;Conceptually, there really is nothing more that Dawkins could have added to the subject, and accordingly, he has added nothing. The only conclusion that I can reach – a distressing conclusion for one who has been more than an ardent admirer of Dawkins - is that he was seduced into the enterprise of writing The God Delusion by the opportunity firstly of playing to the gallery, and secondly, by the prospect of earning a lot of money from the bankable sales to be expected when a high-profile author piles into a lowest-common denominator debate: is there a god or isn’t there?

&gt;No, “consciousness raising” is ever the work of party publicists, propagandists, public relations practitioners and advertising people, of spin doctors, and of people who seek to manipulate public perceptions in their own interest. Consciousness has got nothing to do with understanding, with the often arduous business of learning a new fact, or of mastering a body of knowledge. It has got nothing to do with wit, wisdom or insight.

&gt;However then did Richard Dawkins, illustrious scientist, get caught up in so disreputable a business as the writing of a large book with the preposterous aim of raising the world’s level of consciousness? It seems that he draws his inspiration for so doing by the success of the women’s movement in making most males - and presumably a not insignificant number of females – sensitive to the sexism embedded in our language.

&gt;You may think I am going on about this a bit too much. But it helps me identify the source of the bad odour that emanates from this book, the odour of dishonesty. His new-found enthusiasm for “conscious raising” is opportunistic. It provides what he takes to be a defensible justification for placing such a book before the public in the want of any more legitimate reasons for doing so. To argue about the existence or otherwise of god is a jejune enterprise that in polite society is rightly regarded as bad form. It is a useless, tiresome, noisy and utterly pointless endeavour: you say “I believe in god”, I say “I don’t believe in god”. There is no resolution to this difference in beliefs, and there the matter must rest.

&gt;Analogously, he is like Macbeth, who – in mounting his horse – leaps clean over it, and falls in a heap on the other side. The suggestion embedded in the image is that, without the counter-balancing resistance of conscience, Macbeth’s ambition is out of control, and creates a dysfunctionality that renders him gauche, incapable, and bereft of human capacity.  He cannot even judge the effort required to leap onto his horse. Dawkins, it hardly needs me to observe, clearly does have a great mind, but in the absence of matter to engage with, it is rendered similarly both gauche and dysfunctional. Lacking a real subject, he doesn’t really have an enterprise. 

&gt;t’s easy enough to provide a list of all the bad things in history you can lay at the door of religion, as he readily does, but to be even-handed, you also need to account for the origin of non-religious evil such as was incarnated in people like Stalin, Hitler (no-one could seriously argue that it was his Christianity that motivated Hitler’s desire for lebensraum), Pol-Pot, Amin or Mugabe, or which inspired the Japanese in WW 2.

&gt;The raising of consciousness isn’t the only opportunistic position Dawkins takes up. Making an overt comparison with the world of homosexuality and the fears of public recognition it often entails, he also writes, he tell us, to encourage closet atheists to come out into the open. “My dream” he says, “is that this book may help people to come out”.  Again, I must report that I find myself plainly incredulous. Certainly in the worlds I am reasonably conversant with – Britain, Western Europe, the Commonwealth, perhaps even Canada – it is risible to suggest any comparison between “coming out of the closet”, and “admitting” to being an atheist! Why, all of 40 years ago, on campuses in England, you needed courage to admit to being a Christian, not an atheist! It was a major social indiscretion to be caught going to church on a Sunday morning, and nobody in serious argument quoted from the Bible. Christianity as an aspect of public life in Britain is under siege. South Africa, for instance, is constituted as a secular state (and so also, surprisingly, is Italy). But it is a symptom of the contrived nature of Dawkins’s enterprise that he has continually to inflate the social problem he nominally diagnoses (delusional belief in god) in order to justify attacking it.

&gt;Dawkins is himself not immune to a sense of mystery. He describes himself as a boy: “…tearful with the unheard music of the Milky Way.” What exactly, we are entitled to ask him in the context of the book he has written, did he hear, and why should it have made him tearful? We may congratulate ourselves on our status as rational scientists when we avoid images of patriarchal gods in the sky, and substitute in their place words like “transcendent wonder” (Sagan’s phrase, approved by Dawkins), or “pantheistic reverence” (Dawkins’s phrase) but I find it hard to believe that wonder and reverence could be evoked by mere complexity; they are sensations evoked in the face of incomprehensibility and mystery. And if the wonder is transcendent, where does the transcendence take us, if not to a place outside of the natural world? Many scientists, he agrees, have a “quasi-mystical response to nature and the universe”, but how, I am led to wonder, does “quasi-mystical” differ from “mystical”? Is it mystical or is it not?

Here's what happened. Civil War veterans in the North upset about the post-war decline of patriotic nationalism started getting flags into schools, and so there started to be military-style flag ceremonies for the kids to participate in. Some ceremonies involved flag oaths, and so when Francis Bellamy was working on a Columbus anniversary thing in 1892 for a kid's catalog/magazine, he wrote up a pledge. Bellamy was a Christian socialist and saw the nation as a big family or as a big military unit, with an emphasis on loyalty and unity and obedience to one's country. He also worried about the influx of inferior blood coming from the Mediterranean and from Eastern Europe, and sought to Americanize the immigrants' children.

Over the next twenty years or so, more and more Northern schools adopted Bellamy's pledge as part of their flag ceremonies. The pledge was standardized in the '20s at the behest of patriots and veterans organizations, as part of the rise of war nationalism and the abhorrent anti-'subversive' despotism of the Wilson administration. They added ""to the United States of America"" to make sure that the children of foreigners weren't secretly pledging allegiance to their country of origin.

As many people know, students are *not* required to say the Pledge, thanks to a Supreme Court ruling defending the rights of Jehovah's Witnesses. But what few know is that three years before this important decision, in 1940, the very same SCOTUS lineup decided *against* Jehovah's Witnesses in the case *Minersville School District v. Gobitis*. In the wake of this decision, a rash of mob violence against Jehovah's Witnesses broke out: rounding and roping JWs like cattle, pouring castor oil down their throats (in one case a JW urinated blood), dousing their cars in castor oil and painting swastikas and Nazi-related epithets, draping a flag on a car and taking anyone who refused to salute or kiss the flag and smashing their heads into the car for up to nearly thirty minutes, destroying their cars with stones and bats, and in one case castration. The violence was overseen and assisted by local police officers, and about one-fifth of the 843 vigilante incidents involved members of the American Legion (currently clamoring for a anti-flag burning amendment).

And of course when ""under God"" was added to the pledge, this was done in response to a sermon by Eisenhower's minister George Docherty, in which Docherty claims that the important difference between the United States and the USSR is not our commitment to human rights and democracy as opposed to totalitarianism, nor our commitment to free enterprise as opposed to a command economy. No, it's the fact that we are a God-fearing nation as opposed to ""modern, secularized, godless humanity"". He goes on to call atheists ""spiritual parasites"".

When people from other countries find out about the Pledge of Allegiance, especially when they grew up under Soviet communism, they are little bit shocked and even embarrassed. What the fuck is the *United States* doing, having its schoolchildren recite a loyalty oath? What is this stupid, stupid shit?

I recognize that it's not all that important an issue, but the Pledge of Allegiance is just disgusting. It appeals to the most hateful, nationalistic, xenophobic, mean-spirited, bullying, authoritarian elements of American political culture, and no free nation should have anything like it in its schools.",True,,c06xjnc,True,0,1231521486,ofrbidfbi,7,7,0

The following English things are extremely overrated:

   1. The Arctic Monkeys. What the FUCK.
   2. Oasis. They ceased being good over 10 years ago. They're also complete fuckwits.
   3. Kate Moss. Emaciated long term drug addicts are not celebrities.

   6. British humour in general. I'm looking at you, pretty much everything except Red Dwarf.
   7. Your national soccer side. Your complete obsession is in no way refelcted by the results of your shitty team. Way to not even qualify for Euro 2008 there, losers.
   8. As above, but cricket.
   9. Tights. Why does everyone wear tights all the time? If it's too cold for a skirt, WEAR SOMETHING FUCKING ELSE.


The following things about your country are completely fucked:

* I know it's a generalisation, but really, do something about your teeth. What is wrong with your dentists?
* Stop wearing all black, all the time - it's as miserable as your fucking demeanour, or the weather.
* Your godawful news coverage. It's as though the worst of all the days' tabloids are distilled into a half hour of completely inane shit. This includes the BBC, who now apparently do puff pieces on ladies who adopt children with Downs' Syndrome - and this is national news?
* Your fucking bland conversations about the weather. ""I'll bet it's nice in Australia now, old chap"". I'm pretty sure you can at least see the sky there, you pasty fucker. And no, I don't surf. Stop asking about it.
* Gordon Brown. He completely fucked an entire country (Iceland, fyi) for a few points in the polls, then pats himself on the back, saying that he ""saved the world"". Complete cunt. The colour of poo is Brown.
* The police can stop you and search you for no reason. Are you a democracy? This should be an issue for you.
* You're ALWAYS on CCTV. In public, on the bus, in the library, in stores, in toilets. Why? WHY? This should also be an issue for you.
* There are no bins on the street. Stop being such pussies, nobody wants to bomb your shitty garbage. Sidenote: spitting your gum into the gutter along with whatever phlegm you can hack up is not ladylike.
* Your accents are shit. Really awful. I don't care if you invented the language. Welsh, Irish and Scottish accents are far, far better. Also, it's ""um"", not ""ehm"" or ""emm"". Your friend Emma has nothing to do with you being unable to string a sentence together.
* Warm beer. Harden the fuck up. ""Ooh, but it's so cold outside I'd really prefer some flat, lukewarm shit in my mouth"".
* Your ""cold"" beer is not even cold. Refrigeration has been around for a while now. Learn about it.
* We have your Queen on our money, your shitty legal system, and so on, and yet we have to line up in the ""Non-EU"" immigration line (with the Iranians and North Koreans) where we're questioned at length about the intention of our stay in your shitty country. Just like it says on my $500 visa, WORKING HOLIDAY. You're not even part of the fucking EU. Fuck you.
* Convert to the god-damn metric system or don't, for fuck's sake. You can't have it both ways. How many miles per litre does your car get?
* Some of you think you're shit hot. You really, really aren't.
* Pick which side of the road you want to walk on and FUCKING STICK TO IT. You do a reasonable job at staying on the left on the roads, but you stay right on escalators, tube stations change their mind every 15 metres (how many yards is that?) and as a result trying to walk down the street is like pulling teeth (which some of you should look into anyway).

Considering some of the most problematic places in the world right now are in Africa and the Middle East, the places that were conquered most by Europeans, there most likely is some relationship between the two. Add on to that how stable most European countries are (and the US, Canada, and Australia which are all countries where Europeans displaced and killed off the native people) and the lopsided economic deals that were made with Westerners right after many of colonial powers left and it seems evident that there is correlation.

Also, one of the things that rarely gets mentioned during talks about colonialism is the suppression of cultural leaders while under European rule. For example, while some of the elites of India learned Western philosophy and while there was some Western cultural influences that spread through all of India, for the most part Indians were kept ignorant due to the British wish for keeping opposition down. In this time, the culture in non-colonized places was allowed to grow in its own right and develop less repressing practices. On the other hand, in India, political and philosophical growth was hampered by the British wish to repress the Indian people. Instead, British controlled education focused on promoting teaching certain elites that the Britons were the ones who brought in all positive cultural ideas and Indians brought in all negative cultural ideas. This created a class of people Indians who held contempt for most Indians but full of admiration for England. Once the British people left, the Indian people had to restart the education and ruling system and had to restart Indian cultural growth and because of that, many outdated cultural practices remain today that aren't present in non-colonized places.",False,,c06xnic,True,0,1231529608,[deleted],10,10,0

There are a lot of countries which are fairly religious and rich and poor but irreligious. 

As an example: Ireland is more religious and social conservative than Western Europe, yet its GDP per Capita is one of the highest in Europe. 

A lot of sub-Saharan African countries are not very religious in the organised religion sense – but they are fairly poor. When South American countries are compared to African countries you will probably see that South American countries are more religious than African countries – and yet they are economically better developed.

Former Soviet countries are more irreligious than Western European countries but they are comparatively poorer (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, etc...). 

The problem is that history and religion is extremely intertwined – the religion (or religiosity) in a region can be caused by other political influences (that also affect economic development). What complicates it further is that some religions may impede economic growth (e.g. radical Islam) while  other religions  may not impede growth.

Although I have to say I disagree about your first argument rather strongly: the Middle East, compared to everywhere else I can think of, was relatively untouched by Western conquerors. The first European crusade succeeded, all the others failed. Then Europeans appeared again when Napolean invaded Egypt. Other than that, there was a lot of administration in the 1800's  and 1900's, but no real colonialism. Yeman, the United Arab Emirates, and many other countries had little contact with Europeans. Palestine didn't either until 1945. In Africa, the only part of Africa never conquered or ruled by a European power is what turned into Ethiopia and Somalia today, two of Africa's biggest shitholes. Somalia is the perfect example of a country that never had European rule. Of course, so is Japan unless you count post World War II American administration.

I don't see how the stability of European countries helps your point – I don't see as it is related. If you count all the World wars and possibly Bosnia, the European countries fucked themselves up something fierce. The South American countries threw off European rule fairly early on – in the first half of the 1800s. Many of those countries continue to be shitholes, though obviously these are areas of some of the worst colonialism. The difficulty is saying that the strong societies mowed over by European conquerors would have grown up into societies more benevolent than what the society grew into with European rule: Aztecs and Zulus being principal examples. Contrary examples are the Sikhs and the Iroquois league – both of which could have created better future societies. 

That's a really difficult argument to make. There just aren't that many examples of cultures that progressed without European domination. Tribesman in the Amazon, tribesman in Southeast Asia, the Tibetans, China, Afghanistan, Turkey maybe. About the lopsided economic deals – I don’t really know any examples, but you're probably right. Britain's deal with the Shah of Iran was post-colonial, and I think that also supports your contention.

Interesting you bring up India – I've read articles and talked to many Indians who hold the belief that India is far, far, far better off having had British administration than otherwise. Those Indians who would have progressed to powerful positions would, according to these guys, probably not have been benevolent. At least in the manner you or I would agree ""benevolence"" could be measured. The prejudice I have makes my argument skewed, and I admit it's prejudice – but it's also prejudice shared by the Indians I've talked to. 

&gt; Once the British people left, the Indian people had to restart the education and ruling system and had to restart Indian cultural growth and because of that, many outdated cultural practices remain today that aren't present in non-colonized places.

You're saying the prevalence of the caste system and arranged marriages is more common because of European influence rather than the absence of it. I'm not saying you're wrong, but I'm not quite ready to agree. British influence was strongest in urban centers, far more prevalent than in the villages. Today, more enlightened practices seem to dominate the cities, and be fairly lacking in rural area. While I do agree that this is just the nature of cities, I have to believe that it's also due to British influence.

Genuine peace will require that these two groups sit down together without preconditions. But the events of the past few days seem to have made this more unlikely than ever. That is the challenge for the new administration in Washington and for its European allies.
Gaza is a secular society where people listen to pop music, watch TV and many women walk the streets unveiled

Last week I was in Gaza. While I was there I met a group of 20 or so police officers who were undergoing a course in conflict management. They were eager to know whether foreigners felt safer since Hamas had taken over the Government? Indeed we did, we told them. Without doubt the past 18 months had seen a comparative calm on the streets of Gaza; no gunmen on the streets, no more kidnappings. They smiled with great pride and waved us goodbye.

Less than a week later all of these men were dead, killed by an Israeli rocket at a graduation ceremony. Were they “dangerous Hamas militant gunmen”? No, they were unarmed police officers, public servants killed not in a “militant training camp” but in the same police station in the middle of Gaza City that had been used by the British, the Israelis and Fatah during their periods of rule there.""

The Settlements are the Israeli's key tool to removing the Palestinians chance of having a real state.

Not because these communities are in any real sense viable are sensible, but simply because they give the Israeli military and government the ability to deny the land, and the gigantic buffer zones around the land to the Palestinian people.

Oh but your concerned now that the gene is out.

First of all, for the love of G-d please don't bring genetics into it.  It doesn't end well.

Why they didn't protest when Hamas was elected?  Hmmm...let me think. 

 Maybe because they knew the EU and the UN had sent people to monitor the election, THEY ok'd Hamas as a party and they also attested that the election was fair and above board.  That or maybe they're more like the UK or Australia and not the US and Israel in that they have not identified Hamas itself as a terrorist organisation.  The [UK](http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/security/terrorism-and-the-law/terrorism-act/proscribed-groups) and [Australia](http://www.nationalsecurity.gov.au/agd/www/nationalsecurity.nsf/AllDocs/95FB057CA3DECF30CA256FAB001F7FBD?OpenDocument)  only identify Hamas' Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades as being terrorist entities, their militant wing, not the political party itself - so as to encourage diplomacy.  The EU doesn't make this distinction anymore although it is worthwhile noting both [France and Germany](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3100518.stm) wanted to take the UK's and Australia's approach and not persecute the political party for that exact same reasoning.  

Moot point really.  Norway isn't in the EU but maybe they were just thinking along the same lines as these four.

Anyways encouraging diplomacy and democracy was the idea behind making the distinction.
It was working too, having been elected fairly they'd offered and had kept to a ceasefire and they weren't the ones that broke it.  They were even arresting militant groups trying to operate in Gaza.  Public opinion polls at the time showed a growing moderate population backing a 2 state solution with Israel.  At one point it was a majority. We'd have got away with it if it weren't for those pesky IDF kids.

The Israeli Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, funded by the Israeli Government, released a report November 16th saying that: 

&gt;[""since the 'recent' escalation, **for the first time**, there is direct Hamas involvement in the rocket and mortar shell fire""](http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/malam_multimedia/English/eng_n/html/hamas_e011.htm)

So you see.  The Israel government, by breaking the ceasefire as reported on November 5th and the ensuing escalation is actually seen to be having a radicalising effect coaxing the genie out!

It makes sense from the angle that the goal all along was to create an Emmanuel Goldstein to unify against in an attempt to justify collective punishment and ethnic cleansing.

That's why the Norwegians are hitting the streets now.  Apparently they've read Nineteen Eighty-Four.

As a basic equation, sure.  But there are different kinds of energy (fat and sugar, principally) and they are metabolized differently among different groups of people (including ethnicities).  Put a Native American on a European diet and he'll gain weight.  It happens, and it happens for many other groups as well.

So the issue as I see it is pretty simple: why are we (Reddit, yes, but the world in general, also) so focused on attacking people rather than also considering other factors.  There are valid medical reasons for weight gain (even severe).  There are reasons for hunger issues, as well as energy usage and fat processing.  There are a _lot_ of metabolic issues out there and many can be caused by environment and food.  When you have a whole population move in a direction, why do people remain ignorant of this and focus on a one-by-one approach of insults and rebuking rather than stopping to look at the forest?

Large numbers of people are gaining weight.  Diets have changed, as have environments.  It's complicated stuff, sure, but it can't be ruled out.

The Jewish Agency then started to actively buy land from the Arabs during the period of the Mandate.

Things began to get tense, with Arab riots against Jews, and Jewish reprisals (although the official policy of the Haganah, the Jewish self-defense organization, was restraint, there were a couple of Jewish terrorist groups who attacked mostly the British administrators in Palestine, but also took revenge on Arabs). When the Mandate ended the UN divided Palestine up into separate Jewish and Arab entities, but the surrounding Arab countries invaded (presumably in support of the Palestinians, but mostly to carve up the territory for themselves). The Zionists won decisively and ended up with more territory than what was originally granted by the UN. 

It's highly simplistic and unhistorical to presume that the Israelis ""stole"" the land, as many people believe. Perhaps you can make that argument about the settler movement, but the country of Israel's history is not much different than other countries who won their independence through war.

I started working on an app with two friends in September, and we went live in the store on October 13th. Our development time was just over a month, part time (two of us are grad students, and the third is a recent grad). The app, incidentally, is called [Pano](http://debaclesoftware.com/) -- it's a photography app that lets you take panoramic photos, doing all the image matching, stitching, etc on the device.

**Sales / Reviews:**

* It's hard to tell how much bad reviews matter. Night Camera (which has been panned with hundreds of terrible reviews on the App Store) jumped to the #1 spot by getting mentions on sites like Engadget, Ars, etc

* BUT! quality still does matter. Lots of people buy apps as a result of word-of-mouth. (In our case, this means Flickr, Twitter, email, etc...) Word of mouth is the long tail of app sales, resulting in a low but consistent baseline of sales.

* Getting mentions / reviews on big sites is golden. We got on TUAW right as our app launched, and we were blasted with traffic for days as a result.

* There are a *ton* of Apple / iPhone blogs that get literally zero traffic. We got reviews on some sites that appear to be visited by no one.

* The Top Lists on the App Store are the holy grail for many apps, and are a sort of feedback system. Once you're there, your visibility is so high that you often get a bunch of new sales as a result, which, in turn, keeps you there. That being said, being in a Top List alone doesn't appear to be enough to keep you up there. (We've been in the top 50 in the US and top 10 in a number of European countries at different times.)

**Development:**

* The development tools provided by Apple aren't the greatest. Their Instruments application (which is meant to watch things like object allocation, leaks, etc) is buggy, often crashes your app, and doesn't always catch everything.

* Support and tutorials for the iPhone SDK are also fairly limited. Much of development process was spent solving problems that, on other platforms, might have been resolved with a quick visit to Google.

* Apple's restrictions are often arbitrary and extremely frustrating. That being said, it would *appear* that bending some of their rules is often tolerated. As a developer you often find yourself frustrated because you're not allowed to do something that you know is possible. ([More on Apple's Public/Private API problem here.](http://lepinski.net/2008/12/apples-private-api-problem/))

* Memory management on the iPhone is a shitmare. Your app is not allowed to query the available memory. If memory gets low your app is notified by the OS, and if it gets *too low* your app is killed. This is a system that would work well if Apple's approval process actually weeded out all leaky apps, which I suspect is not the case. If you build a memory intensive app you will find that sometimes it simply get killed, and there's nothing you can do about it, beyond spending weeks trying to reduce your memory usage any way you can.

**Dealing with Apple:**

* The review process isn't terrible, but it can be as fickle as you've heard. We had an update to Pano rejected because the new app icon we were going to use included a picture of an iPhone, which Apple claimed violated their copyright. Unfortunately Apple doesn't provide a list of visual copyrights, only copyrighted names. ([More on the rejection incident here.](http://lepinski.net/2008/12/pano-rejected-over-new-icon-sigh/))

* Communication is often on-par with or worse than what you'd expect from customer support, despite the fact that you now essentially have a business relationship with Apple. When we first signed up for the Dev Program we said we were an individual, not a business (mistake), and switching this over was an excruciating process, with one rep telling us one thing, then another telling us the opposite. Emails took &gt; 2 weeks to get answered.

* Apple provides daily and weekly sales data, as well as monthly financial reports. The daily data is not to be taken literally, though, because it is apparently less reliable than the financial reports, which are definitive. After our first monthly report came in we saw about 5% lower sales than we'd gotten by summing the daily sales reports. We emailed Apple and were told (after waiting 3 weeks for a reply) that the daily sales aren't official. My guess is they may falsely count people who click through to buy and don't complete the purchase for whatever reason.

The g-factor is common to all types of intelligence (I.e. verbal ability, mathematical ability, etc...). A test that measures g accurately is called g-loaded. The traditional IQ test is g-loaded but it is not the most – the best test for that is Raven's progressive matrices (this test is also extremely culture negative since it depends only on basic line drawings). So the best test for “intelligence” would therefore be a g-loaded test. A few interesting things about the g-factor: 

It is innate (I.e. born with) ability.
It is correlated with reaction time. 
It is correlated with future success.
A person with high-g can be identified from fMRI images while he is doing problems (such as RPM) by looking at the brain activity.
It is correlated with brain size and the size of certain areas in the brain.
It is fairly immutable (I.e. can not be changed through training/learning).
It is highly heritable. 

&gt; He said most IQ tests are racially and gender biased. Because back in the day, when they were written, the model for intelligence was based off of white well-to-do males. 

What is your professor's name for interest sake?

The culture bias is something that is frequently used to try and explain the IQ gap between different groups of people. Unfortunately this is not the right reason (the differences still appeared in tests that were “culturally negative”). From WP: 

&gt; The American Psychological Association's report Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns[14] states that IQ tests as predictors of social achievement are not biased against people of African descent since they predict future performance, such as school achievement, similarly to the way they predict future performance for European descent.

The correct answer will probably be interesting and will involve a variety of factors. 

&gt; white well-to-do males.

There is evidence that the average IQ of men and woman doesn't differ significantly. The variance of the IQ differs however (the variance is higher in men). This may explain why there are more top men in a lot of science positions. Just don't mention this hypothesis if you are the [president of Havard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers).

&gt; That's the extent of what I know on that, because IQ never really interested me.

Intelligence testing is (for me at least) an extremely interesting subject (that is why I am neglecting my M thesis by reading all this stuff up...). It will become a lot more interesting during the next decade when the brain is understood better.

You said Israel's existense was  valid historically, theologically and legally. I am saying that people don't have rights to places historically. And Israel proves this. 

It was necessary to evacuate the land of Palestine of non-jews if Israel was to be a properly racist state. The conditions were created to do so, and circumstances also assisted. But Israelis have no right to have a country in Israel anymore than anyone else has ever had a right in any other country. Countries don't come into existence because they deserve to by precedent. Its not written on the ground somewhere in Jerusalem that is a jewish city. Its been a lot of things to a lot of people. Whatever national identitys it achieved over history, were formed by brute force. History had little to do with it. Nor has it ever in any country. 

That being true, it is also true that if you take people from the place they live and force them to leave in order to form a country, you will not have peace until you have destroyed their cultural identity or absorbed them. You can create a country by force, but then there are consequences. Israel can not absorb Muslims and Semitic Christians because it is a racists state. So Israeli's have a country but they can have no peace. 

Israel does not exist because a much discredited book says it should. It exists because Europe had a torrent of guilt after WWII and rather than give the Jews a country in Germany, the perpetrator of horror, they foisted it on a disorganized community in the ME. They gave the Jews a country full of brown people because Europe, at the time, didn't think any place  lived in by brown people belonged to anyone. That is the legal basis of Israel.

Then the people decided to show their solidarity and 40,000 braved the cold winter ice snap that has been sitting over Europe to raise awareness to what is going on.  A ceasefire broken by Israel and an invasion in which children in their hundreds are numbered in those killed, in which UN buildings and vehicles have been targeted, where civilians are put in a house and told to stay put only then to be shelled by the IDF.  A conflict which has seen both chemical and cluster munitions being used in the most densely occupied district in the Middle East.  An area where 1.5million are being collectively punished, regularly have to go without water, electricity and food.  A people, many of them already refugees, who have been denied control of their own borders and airspace.  Even international aid workers have been restricted by Israel from going to the help of those caught up in the urban 'killing fields' leaving them dying or rotting - and all the while holding a concerted (but failed) effort to limit the extent to which the media can report it to the world.

The state that this law is in effect in is considered one of the most backward states of our nation. This law was enacted during the Depression area in this state, which was hit particularly hard by the economic crisis at the time. While I cannot speak for those who enacted this law, it seems to be geared towards cutting costs, an important consideration in this time period due to declining government revenues. In addition, at least one of the articles I read seemed to indicate that the savings were at least partially spent on other expenses for the sheriff's department. Why this law has not been changed before now, I do not know. Nor can I speak for the legislative bodies of Alabama regarding this particular matter.

What I DO KNOW is that this particular sheriff was providing inadequate nutrition to his inmates. He had been ordered by a judge several times before this to improve conditions, and had failed to do so. Do you know what happened? HE WAS COMPELLED BY THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM TO FIX THE PROBLEM. In the end, justice was served for these inmates, much as I suspect it would be in your particular country.

I'm sure there are laws in your country that both its citizens and citizens of other countries consider idiotic. There may even be people in the US commenting in bigoted, shortsighted manner you just did regarding these particular laws.

the most vocal advocates of protecting culture. You bsically have been making crap up and saying it was the fault of anthropologists, I'm assuming merely 

because you dislike me.

You haven't been making logical arguments, if you had you would have a stronger argument than correlation. For everything you argued based on correlation I 

can make a similar argument that is just as bad that Egyptians building pyramids is linked to the Mayans building pyramids. All of those examples you mention 

have similar outcomes and motivations but had vastly different mechanisms.

The reason why Cortes found native support for his conquest of Tenochtitlan was because of the brutal regime the Aztecs had imposed. One of the reasons the 

Aztecs spread their empire was to bring back slaves whose hearts they could cut out for Huitzilopochtli. The only reason the Aztecs had an empire is because 

the vassal states were afraid of the Aztecs coming back and killing off their entire city and surrounding areas. This was actually worsening in the decades 

before Cortes arrived because Tenochtitlan was growing bigger. The Aztec had to put down many rebellions. The Aztec demanded maize, cacao, obsidian, cotton, 

jade and other products. Failure to pay was usually the end of that city with any survivors likely being marched back to Tenochtitlan to have their chests 

cut open. The mgnitude isn't what was changed, it was harsh either way. For you to adequately make your point you would have to do so with more than spoted 

evidence. One example every 10 years is not evidence for what you describe.

&gt;The mechanisms that led to this change were many, but some were the usage of prime land, horses and beasts of burden, iron and steel tools, guns, etc by the 

oppressors, which the oppressed groups lacked and had never experienced. Ireland exported food during the blight worsening the famine, in much the same way 

Colonial authorities exported metals, food and used prime land during the droughts.

You are making it sounds like it would be harder to do these things with moe efficient tools. I suspect that isn't your argument though so why don't you 

clarify it?

&gt;The Darien gap is an impediment, otherwise why would fauna so different on side and on the other? It might not be night and day different, but it proves it 

is an impediment, like the Andes. The gap increased the costs of trade, making it less profitable.

Profit isn't the only reason why groups will trade. Regardless inasmuch as the Darien Gap may have made overland trade happen rarely the Manteno of Ecuador 

are whon to have had trade routes along the Pacific into Mesoamerica and South America. There are also many instances of areas with vastly different fana 

without and barriers. It is a reaction or lack thereof to environmental pressures.

As I said before trade may not have been direct but through intermediaries in the same way that obsidian from Pachuca has been found further North than any known Aztec routes.

&gt;Are you making the claim that disease devastated the native only once? Zorita just saw further devastation, and the devastation due to epidemics continued until the end of the Colony. My argument is that those epidemics had higher rates of mortality because of Colonial policies.

No. In fact I've mentioned at least a few epidemics. You had originally made it sound as though Zorita had been there before any epidemics. I corrected that and showed that most of the population had already died due to disease. If you want to say they had higher rates of mortality due to spaniard policies you need to actually be able to show that and to what degree. For people who rarely lived over the age of 34 that they might suddenly only live to 34 would not be congruent with yoru claim.

&gt;Dude, honestly, you're smoking crack. Are you seriously arguing Aztecs had huge ranches of prime crop land devoted to cattle? Or that they created mines like those in Guanajuato and Potosi with their terribly high rates of mortality? Or that they prohibited key crops due to their religious bigotry? That doesn't mean all Spanish or Europeans were responsible for these actions, but these policies existed for a fact, and very soon after the Conquest. Honestly, you're no better than those Holocaust deniers.

I'm saying the Spaniards were no moe harsh a master than the Azteccs themselves had been. The Spaniards prohibited growing Amaranth for similar reasons as they prohibited utting hearts out of people's chests. You can keep making insanely poor and increibly weak comparissons between me and some crummy people. That's your deal. Though to me all it means is you have no good argument and you have to resort to petty sheepish insults where you insult me rather than have anything worthwhile to say on the matter.

&gt;How can it not have been a more oppressive environment?

Why would it mean it was more oppressive? In fact the Spaniards had more local support than the Aztecs duer to how demonicly oppressive the Aztecs were were their neighbors. You keep trying to compare me to genocidists but really the better comparison could be made between the Aztec and those violent dictators who killed millions. There are many awesome things about the Aztec civilization but their barbarism surpassed probably any other group on the planet. Moctezuma II sacrificed thousands merely to welcome Cortes to the city. As long as we compare them both by the same standards there is nothing appealing about either of them but much that is appaling. Fo every ill you can accuse the Spanish of the Aztec had an analog.

&gt;Calpulli as a concept existed beyond the cities and Nahuatl-phone areas. Small towns and villages, even outside of the Triple Alliance were organized in the same way.

You are making a statement not backed up by any records.

&gt;No, it is the correct definition of domestication. If a ""domesticated muscovy duck"" is the same as a ""wild muscovy duck"", then it is a tame duck, not a domesticated duck. A dog can interbreed with a wolf, but that doesn't make it the same species, anymore than a lion and a tiger are the same species just because they can interbreed. A wolf pup brought up by humans is not a dog and doesn't act like one. Same for elephants and deer.

I'm serious, your definition is not much more tan a self-serving lie. You act as though domestication creates a new species. It may but it doesn't necessarily. Muscovy ducks are a domesticated animal. Muscovy ducks whether domesticated or not are the same species capable of breeding and producing fertile offspring. Dogs and wolves are in fact the same species, look it up, while you're at it you may want to fact check most of what you've said. Yes, a chihuaha and a timber wolf are the same species. Lions and tigers are not the same species. Their territory doesn't overlap they would not reproduce on their own and they don't produce fertile offspring. The same can be said about donkeys and horses these are also known as cryptids.

The Israeli Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, funded by the Israeli Government, released a report November 16th saying that: 

&gt;[""since the 'recent' escalation, **for the first time,** there is direct Hamas involvement in the rocket and mortar shell fire""](http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/malam_multimedia/English/eng_n/html/hamas_e011.htm)

The recent escalation they are referring to was reported November 5th. [Hamas did not start this conflict](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7709603.stm), it was Israel that broke the ceasefire in launching an incursion; calling in airstrikes and killing 6.

Prior to that there were even [reports of Hamas rounding up and arresting those that belonged to militant groups outside Hamas whom they suspected were trying to break the ceasefire.](http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL103182282) During this time Israel did not remove restrictions both in and out of Gaza as agreed in the ceasefire  conditions.

snedig talks about a distinction between aspects of Hamas.  The UK and Australia only identify Hamas' Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades as being terrorist entities, their militant wing, not the political party itself - so as to encourage diplomacy. The EU doesn't make this distinction anymore although it is worthwhile noting both France and Germany wanted to take the UK's and Australia's approach and not persecute the political party for that exact same reasoning.

Moot point really. Norway isn't in the EU but maybe they were just thinking along the same lines as these four.  If he's Norwegian then I suggest it implies that Norwegians think along those lines.  I'm from Britain and I know that the distinction is made.  I also happen to know that the Palestinians have A LOT of support in the Republic of Ireland and in Catholic areas of Northern Ireland...they empathise with them a great deal to the extent of drawing murals on street walls showing their solidarity.

Do i condemn the rocket attacks into Israel?  Yes and that is what I'd feel is a general consensus.

But we are also able to make the distinction between that not justifying ethnic cleansing, land grabs and persecution of the Palestinian people.

We also see how there is an effort to portray all these rockets as being the work of Hamas and we are very much aware that the militant wing associated with Hamas was never the only party firing rockets and people are not buying into the umbrella term 'Hamas' just like the Bush Administration did used 'AlQaeda' to justify aggression, invasion, occupation and the collective punishment of 1.5 million people.

For one reason or another Europeans are  reasonably quite aware of both sides of the problems.  Not as much as we should be....which is why the Norwegian thing was so good because things like that bring it into the mainstream which means people sit up and take more notice when the UN say that civilians are on the receiving end and that there is a humanitarian disaster.",True,,c06y0bn,True,0,1231562716,z22go4,2,2,0

Israel just has to stop being racist and apartheid. It can do this by abandoning the West Bank and closing the settlements.  Then it will be left with the non-racist bit inside the 1967 borders.

The whole idea of ""cutting costs in the depression era"" in this manner is all kinds of stupid. If the state gives $1.75 per prisoner per day to feed the jailed populace, and then tells the sheriff he can feed them even cheaper and pocket the difference, this is **NOT** cutting costs for the state. **The state still pays $1.75 per prisoner**, the only person who benefits from the cost cutting is the sheriff, who gets rich by starving the prisoners. This whole line of reasoning is so full of fail that only some inbred moron with the IQ of a pumpkin could have dreamed it up. And a large proportion of similarly inbred yokels in the population who swallowed this reasoning.

This whole business of privatization has gone too far. I am as capitalist as they come, and I would love to privatize a whole bunch of stuff that government now does. But I *would never, ever dream of privatizing the police, the court/penal system, or the military.*

Why? Because these are functions that concern the legitimate use of force against individuals. The police can arrest and book you, the courts can sentence you to jail or even legal execution, the jails hold people who have been legally deprived of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the constitution. For *any* of this stuff to be legal, it has to be done by duly elected government, **not** by private citizens. This is the only way to keep the process honest. Even more so, this is the only way to keep the process *moral*.

We, as citizens, elect a government and give it rights that include arresting us and putting us in jail if we break laws. We give these rights to a government, elected by us and accountable to us, not to some private proxy that the government delegates to the task. Delegating the use of legalized force to a private individual is just wrong.

Just as we need a separation of church and state, we need a separation of market and state. The state does not exist to turn a profit, that's the job of a market. The state exists to fulfill goals that *cannot* or *should not* be done by the market. You may argue whether universal health care or universal education or social security are really appropriate functions of the state. You'll find plenty of people on both sides of the issue. But the use of force is *solely* a function of the state, since none of us elected a private individual and gave him that authority. Yet we have privately run prisons in this country that have total control over the lives of their inmates, and no citizen of this country ever elected them or gave them this power.

Ownership is a privelege extended to oneself and others jointly and amounts to a covenant. In this covenant, owners are established with certain rights to certain objects.

It is always protected by the possiblity of focused violence against any breaker or violator of the covenant.

No, that's not right, I'm afraid. That would be better used to describe early-form socialism (ie, a socialist state that is just recovering from capitalism). In the early-forms the governance (whether a central body or soviets as was intended after the october revolution) takes control over industry, and it is still run 'for a profit' but for the profits of the state. As the state moves towards late-term socialism and communism, the need for profits is removed, as the goal is to transition to a state where money does not exist, but that people are working for restitution in forms of other goods.

The 'Soviet Union' was never communist, in fact the term as applied was only valid in that the USSR was governed by a party that called itself 'The Communist Party'. Ditto China and other 'Communist' nations.

According to wikipedia both of you are wrong. She was born in 1905 and came to the united states in 1926. However the russian revolution happened when she was 12 and they moved to Crimea which was not part Russia. So I was correct. She left when she was 12.

Just like her, I came to the united states from Soviet Russia when I was young, however its never a direct connection. We lived in europe for a short time before we can come. 

Second about her being rich. Wikipedia mentioned she was middle-class. Because the middle class was so small Its not hard to argue that she was rich.

Lack of, at least, a governmental organisation (composed of instantly reecallable officials) regulating education is a one-way ticket to people setting up schools to further their own viewpoints. Personally, I'm not too fond of the idea of corporate-sponsored indoctrinationfests. Also, you don't believe everyone deserves the same standard of education regardless of their circumstances?

(interesting aside: I'm not sure the situation over there, but over this side of the pond a ""Public School"" is a school (while still regulated by the government) run privately. We call schools run by the state (that 90% of students go to) State Schools, and if someone said that being sent to a state school was ""cruel"", they'd lose pretty much all credebility)

You have through your post made the same mistake repeatedly through here, and that being the false dichotomy; you assume that since I oppose your position, I support the status quo.

Thirdly, the only way the governments are going to engage in a boycott is if there is popular support for such a measure. I quote again:

*""Twenty years ago this month, ten workers from the Henry Street branch of Dunnes Stores in Dublin's city centre went on strike to protest the selling of produce from Apartheid South Africa.

I see myself as a humanitarian (no surprise there). 

I believe that Israel is basically a European invention (Zionism originates with European Jews) Western powers helped the creation of Israel and more significantly are keeping Israel alive (I know Israel has a economy of its own though heavily funded by US). So Israel is essentially a Western colony in Palestine with a very high proportion of its population immigrated from Europe and the US.

Serious problem here: in my view Israel's survival is dependent on ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian areas, that is, an Israel without the West Bank and to a lesser extend Gaza would feel too unsafe for most Israelis to accept, save a few peace dreamers.

So, how do Westerners deal with that problem? Putting and end to Israel's atrocities and war crimes will most likely spell the end of a Jewish Israel. Guilt ridden Europeans are not able to make any meaningful decision and US is so much on Israel's side that they aren't going to make it either.

My point is siding with the Palestinians would likely mean the end to Israel, siding with Israel means apartheid and slow genocide of the Palestinian.

So we (in the West) have to make up our minds if we want to sustain a colony that is only possible through grave crimes against humanity.

....when the EU disintegrates, it will be awash in a sea of Islam....and we both know it.



:D

&gt;According to Global Insight, ANPA could cost the U.S. nearly $7 trillion in real output by 2030, or about $650 billion a year. Meanwhile, 800,000 U.S. jobs would be lost annually for several years.

Where does this money go?  Why the job loss?  From what sectors will these jobs be lost?  Is there an alternative energy solution that might help reduce the job loss?

&gt;According to Energy Department data, from 2000 to 2006, per capita output of C02 in the U.S. plunged 4.7%. Meanwhile, it increased by 3% in Europe. Yet Europe's energy taxes are five to 10 times what they are in the U.S.

A reduction of 4.7% for a total of what?  An increase of 3% for a total of what?  The use of percentages here makes me think that America probably still has a far higher output of CO2 than Europe.

Depending on where these things are found it may be impossible to actually know who the descendants are and in some other cases the *tribe* (I'm italicizing that because I know it's not the best word) is OK with the artifacts or remains being studied. Remains found in Illinois may be Iroquois or they may in fact be Sioux. In some other cases the remains are part of a private collection which often is outside the realm of what anthropology can do anything about unless it is an anthropologist's collection in which case that anthropologist is obviously an exception barring other mitigating circumstance. There are still legal hurdles today and there will be in the forseeable future whether in the USA, Canada, Mexico or for that matter anywhere in the Americas. How would you suggest it is gone about? While you are complaining about it others are trying to figure this out in a way that is fair and right to the descendants. In Mexico often remains/artifacts are found due to construction projects at which point anthropologists will generally be brought in to document as much as they can and preserve as much as they can at which point the remains/artifacts will be brought either to a museum or school where in some cases not much more will happen with them and in others the artifacts/remains will be released for reburial. However if Olmec remains were found and someone who said they were Mayan tried claiming the artifacts/remains there is obviously a conflict of interests. It is simply not as cut and dry as you are suggesting it should be because it just can't be that cut and dry. Certainly there are exceptions to this but they are only exceptions and not the standard.

The correlations are there but so are correlations to all sorts of other fanciful things. Correlations are nothing more than that, correlations.

Name dropping doesn't help you without citing the authored source at the very least.

The new economy brought in by the Spanish was pretty new though it wasn't particularly harsher. Obsidian was still mined though not as much as it had been since the introduction of steel, most new crops didn't work out so well at first and most food production never occurred at the expense of native foods. Natives benefited as much under this new systema as they did under the old unless you were in the ruling class in which case you didn't benefit the same amount because you no longer got the lions share.

As for Aztec barbarism, it isn't that ridiculous of a statement to make. They ruled by fear and intimidation. Their tributary states faced annihilation if they were just a little short on their tribute and those that survived the scourge of their cities either faced slavery or sacrifice. Having their hearts cut out was just one form that sacrifices took. Children were often the target of these sacrifices. People were burned alive, buried alive in some cases eaten alive. The Mayans had very similar practices that they themselves documented. Anytime there was a drought either of those cultures would start sacrificing people until the drought went away, anytime there was any sort of natural problem sacrifices started happening and in fact they also occurred outside of such disasters. Maybe 20 years ago and anthropology would have agreed with you and chalked it up the the Spanish exaggerating. Sure this would be good for me to consider they were sacrificing people because they thought they needed to to save the world however since you seem to want to hold the Spanish and natives to different standards I think it is fair for me to discuss them like this. If you can portray the Spanish as evil than it is fair for me to portray the Aztec as evil for similar reasons. However if you want me to accept that the Aztec were just being Aztec than it would be fair for me to posit the same about the Spanish. So far what I've said about the Aztec is true in many cases about the majority of Mesoamerican cultures and some American cultures.

I think we are using the term calpulli in different historical contexts with you using it in a more modern sense and me using it in a sense more contemporary with Aztec culture. No big deal. I'd probably have a hard time using an English word in a different time frame if it's usage has changed.

Dogs and wolves may be generally separate for where they live however they do come into contact with each other often enough and have no qualms about breeding with each other. Their offspring is also fertile.  That is generally the definition of species, that two animals can breed to make fertile offspring. This generally means that the animals territories overlaps at least often enough to maintain genetic compatibility though in the case of American bison and the domestic cow the species was likely kept able to interbreed successfully with the European bison though that is just speculation on my part. Regardless of why, they are in fact the same species regardless of the taxonomic names. This is as opposed to a true buffalo which neither cow or bison can successfully breed with. The difference between wild and domesticated animals tends to be that domesticated animals have been selectively bred for certain characteristics such as being docile, producing more meat or milk or things like that. The dominance of those genes does not make them a different species though over time it could very well lead to that. A species which has been domesticated does not imply that all members of said species are domesticated though it is still a domesticated species.

On another note:

Not a Jew myself I grew up in a Jewish environment. My family had (and have) lots of Jewish close friends we had lots of close ties to Israel many of my family went to Israel as volunteers. I remember even before the '67 war there was a general agreement and strong conviction that Israel needed control over the West Bank were it ever to live behind secure borders. We celebrated Israel's victory in that war and we saw it as an almost God given opportunity to alleviate the dangers of that narrow middle stretch of Israel.

Only slowly has it become clear to me that Israel is in fact a creation of an European imagination, the dream of a Jewish homeland.

There is no simple right or wrong here, most significantly Israel is not more right than Hamas (not that I would EVER want to live under Hamas rule or the rule of any other fanatic organization). 

We in the west have taken somebody else's land and made them refugees in their own homeland - no wonder they are not happy and want the occupiers to go away by what ever means that is within their reach.

This is a pro-circumcision website.

In return, I will offer you the wealth of knowledge at this website [CIRP](http://www.cirp.org/), particularly their [library](http://www.cirp.org/library/).

&gt; **Decrease in physical problems involving a tight foreskin [408].**

Tight foreskins are a rare malady that take two forms: phimosis and paraphimosis. Interestingly, both of these problems are likely caused by [initially poor medical advice](http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/info/info-forcedretraction.html) from ignorant medical practitioners (or meddling parents).

&gt; **Lower incidence of inflammation of the head of the penis [162, 168, 172].**

There is actually no clear link between the status of the foreskin and [balanitis](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/balanitis/). For instance, [a study from 1997](http://www.cirp.org/library/complications/vanhowe/) showed that circumcised boys suffer from a higher risk of balanitis.

More importantly, forced retraction can result in balanitis---and forced retraction is very easy to avoid; just don't do it.

&gt; **Reduced urinary tract infections.**

[Increased urinary tract infections (UTIs)](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI), like most pro-circumcision talking points, mainly came as the result of dubious studies. It turns out, infants are at a higher risk for UTI in the weeks following circumcision. Besides the fact that UTIs are generally easy to cure and infrequent, the incidence of infection are roughly the same between an intact boy and a circumcised boy. *Moreover, the intact adult is less likely to suffer from a UTI than a circumcised adult male, likely because the meatus of the circumcised penis is constantly and directly exposed to the environment.*

More to the point, some doctors recommend circumcision in cases of recurrent UTI. However, there is no medical evidence to support this recommendation. Recurrent UTIs are associated with congenital abnormalities of the upper urinary tract. Indeed, the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Clearinghouse (NKUDIC), a service of the National Institutes of Health does not suggest circumcision as a prevention or cure of urinary tract infection.

It is also interesting to consider girls. A recent Scandinavian study found that girls and boys have about the same incidence of UTI in the first year of life. Girls have a four times higher incidence of UTI in the first six years of life than non-circumcised boys. No special concern is manifested regarding this much higher rate of infection in girls...

Why don't we alter the genitalia of girls?

Therefore, circumcision is not a suitable reason to provide for reducing the risk of UTIs.

&gt; **Fewer problems with erections, especially at puberty.**

This is so vague, all I can do is respond in kind: This is nonsense, and you know it.

&gt; **Decrease in certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as HIV, HPV, chlamydia, syphilis in men and their partner(s).**

Very recently, HIV/AIDS has replaced UTIs as the scare-tactic for promoting amputation of the foreskin. However, safe sexual practices are not only essential, but they are the only reliable and effective means for controlling and avoiding sexually transmitted diseases; even though the UN's recent (U.S.-led) studies suggest that circumcision reduces the incidence of HIV infection, the UN still acknowledges that only sex education and sexually responsible behavior (such as using condoms) are effective solutions.

In fact, [this meta-study of those UN studies](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/120747249/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0)  suggests that 72 circumcisions are necessary in order to prevent one case of HIV infection. In conclusion, the researches make a half-hearted endorsement of the procedure:

&gt; Male circumcision is an effective strategy for reducing new male HIV infections. Its impact on a population level will require consistently safe sexual practices to maintain the protective benefit.

To make my point clear, I'll point out that the last sentence states that 
*consistently safe sexual practices* are necessary to be protected from HIV.

More to the point, the circumcised men in the UN studies are Muslim. No doubt does this cultural affiliation have an effect on their sexual behavior and would explain why these circumcised men are at a reduced risk of HIV.

Furthermore, consider [this article](http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news-1/Role-of-Circumcision-in-Reducing-HIV-Risk-Still-Unclear-27082-1/) that states circumcision does not decrease the risk of contracting HIV for gay men. Then consider [the following study](http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/MeetingAbstracts/ma?f=102180172.html) that shows many gay men engage in unsafe sexual practices.

Also, the U.S. has the highest rate of circumcision among industrialized nations (not considering, say, Israel), and yet the U.S. HIV incidence rate is 3.5 times higher than that of the closest advanced industrialized nation.

Therefore, it is obvious that the UN studies are hindered by confounding variables and that the real solution to the spread of HIV (and other STDs) is not circumcision, but sexually responsible behavior.

&gt; **Almost complete elimination of invasive penile cancer.**

However, penile cancer occurs in *old men* and at an extremely
small incidence. The National Cancer Institute of the U.S. expected a 2008 incidence of 1250 cases. For the U.S., that's rougly:

    1250 / 305186613 \* 100% = 0.00041%

[Wikipedia says](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penile_cancer):

&gt; Penile cancer is very rare in Europe and North America, occurring in about one in 100,000 men in the latter. It accounts for 0.2% of cancers and 0.1% of deaths from cancer amongst males in the United States.

Moreover, it is generally thought that carcinoma of the penis is caused by viruses like HPV and other diseases that result from sexually irresponsible behavior and extremely poor hygiene.

&gt; **Decrease in urological problems generally.**

This is so vague, all I can do is respond in kind: This is nonsense, and you know it.

***Besides, you are completely discounting the disadvantages***

Through science and medicine, the foreskin is known to contain specialized structures, muscle, a complex vascular system, and  tens of thousands of highly concentrated, specialized, erogenous nerve cells and fine touch receptors[\[0\]](http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/)[\[1\]](http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/cold-taylor/). These specialized structures include the preputial sphincter, the frenulum, and the ridged band. In particular, the frenulum is a very erogenous region that is either ablated during circumcision or is underdeveloped on the circumcised penis. The ridged band's fine touch receptors complement the coarse sensory receptors of the glans (head of the penis) and it is always removed during circumcision.

Besides nerves, the foreskin acts as an erogenous sheath in which the shaft and glans glide and with which the frenulum and ridged band are stimulated.

The foreskin provides not just more sensitivity, but *enhanced* sensitivity.

These structures and nerves are essential to the complete experience and functioning of the sex act, so that their amputation results in a clear sensory and mechanical deficiency.

As for empirical data, there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that the foreskin is highly erogenous and greatly enhances the sexual experience by providing another 'layer' of stimulation and function. [One study](http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/ohara/) showed that 6/7 women prefer coitus with an intact penis.

Consider this: I am red-green colorblind and I had no idea that I am deficient until I got to college and somebody [posted a joke similar to this one](http://www.tshirthell.com/shirts/products/a559/a559_bm.gif); for 20 years, I had no idea that I am unable to enjoy various colors and their combinations.

We don't even need silly tests like those dots. We could examine DNA or the eye's cone cells and determine that a person is colorblind; these are physical facts.

Likewise, there is no debate that circumcision destroys sexual 'perception'. The only question is whether the REMAINING tissue (glans and what's left of the inner foreskin) is desensitized due to the conditions engendered by the amputation of the foreskin. While there is conflicting evidence as to the degree of further desensitizing, it is certainly the case that the glans and remaining inner foreskin are transformed into fully external structures---something that is unnatural for these mucosal tissues. They suffer from drying-out, subtle lifelong abrasion (simple contact with clothes), and keratinization (a response that reduces the irritation of drying-out and abrasion, but also results in a reduction of nerve stimulation; intact men, who find themselves to be too sensitive are often instructed to retract their foreskins for intervals of time in order to dull their senses).

Worse, The circumcised penis is often scarred and marked and dried-out---it looks weathered. With an incidence rate as high or higher than the problems it doesn't actually prevent, circumcision causes complications like skin bridges, skin tunnels, discoloration (the 'ring' where lots of tissue should be), hair on the shaft, skin so tight it causes the skin to break and scar upon erection, scars so inelastic that the penis bends on erection, loss of the highly erogenous frenulum (it is always underdeveloped on circumcised penises anyway), and even penis amputation and death.

All of these physical complications cause psychological stress.

This week, a host of policymakers and economists – including four heads of state or government and three Nobel prize-winning economists – descended on Paris to debate how to stick the shattered world economy back together again. A flurry of similar meetings is taking place in advance of the Group of 20 summit in London in April, which aims to redesign global governance.

Already, several themes are becoming commonplace. First, the excesses of the financial sector must be directly tackled through smarter, tougher, global regulation extended to all institutions that pose a systemic risk.

Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, urged closer co-ordination between the world’s regulatory agencies, suggesting that the ECB itself could play a more direct role in banking supervision across Europe.

More generally, participants agreed on the need to rebalance the state and the market. Just as the state had over-extended itself in many developed countries in the 1970s, so the market had over-extended itself today. The state must reassert itself as the guardian of the public good, democratising the economy.

To that end, governments must do a better job of protecting their citizens from the downside of globalisation without reverting to protectionism. Manufacturing industries should be fostered, while financial speculation – which had “perverted” capitalism, in the words of President Nicolas Sarkozy of France – should be discouraged. But Mr Sarkozy insisted that entrepreneurialism should not be stifled by excessive regulation. “We should not go from a deficit of rules to an excess of rules,” he said.

Francis Fukuyama, professor of international political economy at Johns Hopkins University in the US, gave warning of the risks of over-compensating as the pendulum swung back from the market to the state and overestimating the inherent capacity of government institutions.

Amartya Sen, professor of economy at Harvard University, expressed scepticism about the usefulness of viewing all the world’s economic and social challenges through the prism of creating a new capitalism. Civil society, not just government, was vital for promoting the essential values of justice, humanity and equity. “The market should do what it can, but other institutions should do their job, too,” he said.

“I think that the discussion of the state versus the market has many pitfalls. It is not always adversarial. For example, the absence of regulation is bad for the market because it has not forced the disclosure of information which is good for the market.”

Many speakers highlighted the necessity of expanding the Group of Eight industrialised nations to include the big developing countries, such as China, India, and Brazil. In particular, a new, more sustainable, economic relationship should be worked out between the US and China.

But Joseph Stiglitz, professor of economics at Columbia University in New York, gave warning that the establishment of the Group of 20 leading and emerging economies was itself divisive, given there were 192 countries in the world. “By creating these informal groups we are undermining the strength of international institutions like the UN,” he said.

Several European speakers stressed the exemplary role of the European Union in promoting international co-operation. Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, suggested that the world had much to learn from her country’s traditions of a social market economy, which stressed the role of all stakeholders.

Hamas is a symptom not a cause. Ignore Mark Regev, he is sucking Satan's cock. 

The history of Israel, the conquering by white Europeans of land in the middle east and displacing the native population, is something that needs to be taken in to consideration when contemplating the current crisis. Hamas is the latest focus of Israeli aggression but Hamas isn't the problem. The radicalisation of Palestinian people isn't even the problem.

I am not a scholar or an intellectual (as you might have noticed) and am not equipped to present an academically satisfying account.

Health,t1_c06yk9t,,0,1425911310,False,t3_7otci,,t1_c06ystk,t5_2qh9z,"&gt; Benzene in soft drinks has to be seen in the context of other environmental exposure. Taking the worst example found to date, of a soft drink containing 87.9 ppb benzene, someone drinking a 500 ml can would ingest 44 μg (micrograms) of benzene. While there is no justification for a soft drink to contain high levels of benzene (""There is a difference here between a small and unavoidable risk, and a small but avoidable risk.”[5]), the casual consumption of such a drink is unlikely to pose a significant health hazard to a particular individual (see, for example, the EPA IRIS document on benzene[6]). However, spread out over millions of people consuming soft drinks each day, there might be a small number of cancers caused by this exposure.[7]

&gt; The UK Food Standards Agency has stated that people would need to drink at least 20 litres per day of a drink containing benzene at 10 μg to equal the amount of benzene you would breathe from city air every day.[8] Daily personal exposure to benzene is determined by adding exposure from all sources.

&gt; * Air: A European study found that people breathe in 220μg of benzene every day due to general atmospheric pollution. A motorist refilling a fuel tank for three minutes would inhale a further 32μg.[9].[10] The estimated daily exposure from ""automobile-related activities"" is 49 μg and for driving for one hour is 40 μg.[8]

&gt; * Smoking: For smokers, cigarette smoking is the main source of exposure: estimates are 7900 μg per day (20-cigarette-per-day smoker),[9] 1820 μg/day, and 1800 µg/day.[8]

&gt; * Passive smoking: Benzene intake from passive smoking is estimated at 63 μg/day (Canada) and 50 µg/day.[8]

&gt; * Diet and drinking water: 0.2 – 3.1 μg/day[8]

_._
&gt; The major cause of benzene in soft drinks is the decarboxylation of benzoic acid in the presence of ascorbic acid (vitamin C, E300) or erythorbic acid (a diastereomer of ascorbic acid, E315) **{read: NOT phosphoric acid}**. Benzoic acid is often added to drinks as a preservative in form of its salts sodium benzoate (E211), potassium benzoate (E 212), or calcium benzoate (E 213).[11] Citric acid is not thought to induce significant benzene production in combination with benzoic acid, but some evidence suggests that in the presence of ascorbic or erythorbic acid and benzoic acid, citric acid may accelerate the production of benzene.

_._
&gt; The United Kingdom's Food Standards Agency released results on March 31, 2006 for 150 beverages.[9] Its results showed 43 beverages contained benzene, four of which contained levels above the World Health Organization drinking water standards (10 ppb). These four were withdrawn from sale.[24][25]

&gt; Out of 150 soft drinks sampled, 107 (ca. 70%) did not contain detectable levels of
benzene.

http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/fsis0606.pdf

_._
&gt; The FDA released preliminary results[19] in May 2006 for 100 beverages showing that many soft drinks contained low levels of benzene (less than 5 ppb, the federal drinking water limit) while four drinks contained amounts above the standard. Two of these drinks contained amounts 15-18 times above the drinking water standard. Many of the products showed large variations in the amount benzene they contained. The FDA stated that it is working with manufacturers to reformulate products that contain benzene above the federal drinking water standard.

&gt; Over 100 soft drinks and other beverage samples were collected from retail stores in Maryland, Virginia, and Michigan. Only four beverage products containing both added benzoates and ascorbic acid contained benzene levels above the 5 ppb EPA MCL for drinking water. One cranberry juice beverage product with added ascorbic acid and only natural levels of benzoic acid (i.e., no added benzoates) also contained benzene above 5 ppb. All five products have been reformulated by the manufacturers. CFSAN tested samples of these reformulated products and found that benzene levels were less than 1 ppb.

http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/benzdata.html

_._
&gt; On 9 June 2006, Health Canada released its study results of benzene levels in beverages. Four products had levels above the Canadian guideline of five micrograms per litre for benzene in drinking water.

&gt; Health Canada's study found that in more than 80 percent of the 118 products tested, benzene was either not detected or found at levels below the lowest concentration that can be reliably measured.

The situation in economics is very much like any other human activity that is diffuse.  It's an interdependent and complex system: you have to look at all angles and triangulate if you want to get a handle on reality.  No one simplistic ideology will do the job because *all* ideologies are overly simplistic by definition - that's what makes them so appealing but also so dangerous - and just so much to the opponents.

Back in the day before the internet we had shortwave radio - if you really wanted to get a handle on the world you'd listen to as many different broadcasts as possible.  You'd listen to Radio Moscow and Voice of America (and Radio Free Europe to hear the biased crap we wouldn't even get at home).  You'd listen to Radio Havana and Radio Pyongyang because everybody *needs* to hear and be able to recognize extreme propaganda, and you can't really understand where the internal politics is coming from without actually hearing the rhetoric yourself.  I suspect its this experience that makes me recognize the same in today's MSM to trivially.

The same triangulation is required for diffuse academic subjects like economics.  You have to know what the other sides are saying even if you don't agree with them. If for no other reason, to analyze your own ideological biases and to be sure you aren't just as wrong as they.  So you need to know Austrian economics by heart.  You even need to know Marxist economics by heart.   You need to know the academic view and the practical real life reality.  You need to know 1st world capitalist reality and you need to know 3rd world poverty reality. 

If you don't, your entire opinion and source of knowledge is nothing but a house of cards.  We've seen exactly how such a house of cards can collapse because the whole construct of risk and value was such as practiced by Wall Street.

It's delightfully written — the human interest of the suicidal banker opening and closing the piece, and the little historical exposition with pointless info about how VW was founded by Porsche and Hitler, are straight out of The New Yorker playbook — but very misleading.

Here is the nub of what's wrong with the article:

&gt; When Volkswagen’s share price exceeded the point where it made sense for Porsche to buy the company, a number of hedge funds realized that Volkswagen shares have nowhere to go but down...So they shorted huge amounts of VW stock...waiting for the price drop they considered inevitable....Porsche anticipated exactly this situation and promptly bought up much of these borrowed VW shares that the funds were selling.

So, hedge funds believed the price was too high for Porsche to keep buying, so they went short.  But they were wrong, Porsche kept buying.  This was not a trick, they were just wrong.  

(the text I have removed is to do with how VW was ""buying up borrowed shares"" which is a misleading extra piece of technical jargon to make it sound like they did something more complex than just buying more shares)

In practice this is not what most hedge funds were doing.  More likely most hedge funds were involved in what is called a ""relative value"" trade — in the historical relationship between the VW [common stock](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=VOW%3AGR) and the non-voting [preference stock](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=VOW%3AGR).

Eventually Porsche took over VW like they wanted to all along, but because of the hedge funds distorting the market they were forced to do it in a way that ended up making them a killing in the derivatives they used to do it — or [so they claim](http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12523898).  

For me, the moral of this story is that Germany's securities and corporate laws are ridiculous and need reform.  Porsche should have had to reveal more information about their derivatives holdings.  Lower Saxony is a 20% holder in VW, distorting the price.  One of the catalysts of the Porsche event was the so-called ""[Volkswagen Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen#Relationship_with_Porsche.2C_and_the_.22Volkswagen_Law.22)"" whereby any 20% shareholder had power of veto over any takeover.  This in theory made acquisition of more than 20% of VW pointless for Porsche.  But Porsche kept accumulating it anyway anticipating the European Court of Justice would strike it down, which they did.

They pay the full costs of services. The difference is that they negotiate prices in advance.

You know, like every other civilized country does.

&gt; Many doctors won't even take patients covered by those programs because it keeps their costs too high.

And the vast majority continue to accept them b/c dealing with Medicare/aid is easier than the insurance companies.

&gt; Medical bills are high because the government promises to pay most of them. 

[citation needed]

&gt; This gives hospitals and doctors the incentive to charge you whatever you can afford plus whatever the government will loan.

Which could be prevented with a single-payer plan.

&gt; You get universal coverage (at least in theory) but in return you get chronic shortages, waiting lists, mediocre care, and politicized health care.

Except in countries where that doesn't happen.

&gt; ""Until you can point to a real-world, working example of a constitutional republic - you need to get out of the way while we establish a monarchy.""

There were functional republics, mainly within city-states, before the US came into existence. (Greece, Italy, Poland) There was also the Iroquois Confederacy that demonstrated what could be done.

So if James Madison asked for examples of a republic, the FF could have provided them.

Closer to the point: Those of us who want a single-payer system have our case-studies, where are yours?

Treating healthcare like a private good has been a disaster for the US. Those who claim that we could fix it with *more* free market policies need to step up to the plate and give a working example.

&gt; Health care was extremely affordable in this country before the government got involved.

[PBS did an excellent documentary on the history of American healthcare.](http://www.pbs.org/healthcarecrisis/history.htm) You may wish to watch it.

Yes, it's true that care was cheaper before the 1900s, but there were also far fewer options.

Interestingly, there was a time when doctors were expected to provide free services to all hospital patients - and most hospitals were considered charities, to be run by churches.

But times and technology have changed. We've found better ways to do things.

Starting in the 1890s, Europeans began treating healthcare like a public good, rather than a charity. In the US, we shifted from charity to private good.

The result has been quality universal healthcare for most of he industrial world - while we in the US get dicked over by insurance companies.

politics,t3_7oxrp,,0,1425911429,False,t3_7oxrp,,t1_c06z1zp,t5_2cneq,"No, it's the internet making people stupid, and it is a world wide phenomenon.  There are a couple reasons for this.

First, a depressingly large number of people give equal weight to pretty much anything they read on the internet, regardless of the source.  If they read something written by a good journalist, who put months of research into his story, checking out everything, and then they read some random blogger who is just spouting something based on some conspiracy theory, they consider the blogger as good a source as the journalist.

The major news sites have not helped this by blurring the distinctions between articles they publish that are by trained journalists and properly researched, and the blogs they host for their staff, and (for some) the blogging sites they run that let any random person create a blog.

Example: in some of the tech related sites, I saw a story develop about two companies, X and Y, working together in opposition to a third company, Z.  Z was an open source company, so this drew a lot of interest.  I happened to be involved in a business venture with Y at the time, and had access to enough inside information to *KNOW* that X was not working with Y in Y's dispute with Z, and was able to watch the false story develop on the net.  It basically went like this:

1. Some conspiracy nut who thinks X is behind everything that opposes open source in any way (and that X has infiltrated the highest levels of the US government, the EU, and all major media, and that they are working with the Bilderbergers to take over the world--I'm not kidding!), as soon as news came out that Y was in a dispute with Z, said on his blog that X must be backing them.  (It was funny, because Y was also in a big dispute with X, which if they won, would cost X millions or even billions of dollars...which the conspiracy nut saw as evidence that X and Y *are* working together...Y's dispute with X was obviously a ruse, to secretly funnel money to Y via damages in a lawsuit, to fund Y's attack on Z--again, I'm not kidding, that was actually his theory).

2. A blogger at CNET mentions the dispute between Y and Z.  He mentioned that there is some speculation that X could be involved, and likes to the conspiracy nut.

3. The conspiracy nut's blog entry gets mentioned in the comments on a well-read tech legal site.

4. Some random blog I've never heard of cites the CNET blog, but doesn't say ""blog"".  It says the CNET is ""reporting"" that X is behind Y in this matter.

5. Back at the well-read tech legal site, someone reports that CNET has confirmed that X is behind Y in this matter.

6. Other sites pick this up, saying that the well-read tech legal site and CNET are both reporting that X is behind Y.  It spreads from there and is now widely believed, especially in the open source community.

I only know about the above because, like I said, I happened to be involved with Y at the time (in their dispute with X, as a matter of fact), and had access to enough inside information to know that X had nothing whatsoever to do with Y's dispute with Z.  But now I have to wonder how many other things I learned from the internet, from sites like that well-read tech legal site, are actually true.

Second, the internet lets what is essentially a flash crowd develop among people who believe any given idea, making them look bigger than they are.  You can see an example of this in the primaries in the last US election, with Ron Paul.  A heck of a lot of Paul supports genuinely believed that he was going to win the primaries in a landslide and be the Republican nominee.  They had a very distorted view of how most voters saw Paul, because from their point of view, they saw bustling Paul forums, and they saw his book shoot to the top of the best seller list.  The latter was because of the former.  There were organized efforts on the various Paul blogs and forums to get people to buy the book as soon as it went on sale.  It only takes a few thousand quick sales to get a book to the top of the best sellers lists.  But most Paul supporters didn't know that, so saw that book hitting the top of the lists as more evidence that Paul was wildly popular among the people.  When the flash crowd started posting a huge amount of Paul stories to Digg, and Digging them up, they were ecstatic.  But then the 95% of Digg users who has no intention of voting for Paul got tired of seeing all these Paul links, and started Digging them down.  Remember, the Paul supporters mostly thought they were part of a*huge* movement--so how could there stories now be being buried?  Of course--there is an organized conspiracy to suppress the Paul message!

The really insidious thing about all this is that most people, as the internet becomes their main source of information, don't realize that they either have to carefully choose their sources of internet information, or put in a lot of effort to evaluate internet information, if they want *reliable* news.  With a traditional mainstream news paper, or a news magazine like ""Time"" or ""Newsweek"", or network TV news, it takes massively less effort to get reliable news.  (Cable news is questionable, because they are mixing too much non-news programming in.  CNN, for example, with Nancy Grace and Glen Beck).

When I bought a Kindle last year, one of the things I did was subscribe to the ebook edition of the Seattle Times, so now I am reading a traditional (in content, not form!) daily newspaper.  I've noticed in discussions with friends and coworkers that, when we talk about current events, I am now by far the best informed.  I am also the only one using a newspaper.  They will mention something, that they got off the internet, and did not carefully verify, and I'll say ""I just read an article on that in the paper yesterday, and it said..."" and what it said doesn't match what they just told me.  Every time this has happened, and we go to the internet and carefully research it--the paper was right.

I find it very sad that so many newspapers are at risk of going under.  We *need* newspapers--I don't think democratic government is really viable without them.  They don't have to be on paper and delivered--online-only newspapers would be fine, as long as their news stories are written by reporters that are fully trained journalists, and blogging and open commenting is kept out (open commenting is fine if it is on a separate site, so that people looking at search results do not mistake public comments for articles).

It would also be very good to start teaching kids, in junior high or earlier, how to fact check things they find on the internet.  In the Internet Age, that is a fundamental skill, right up there with reading, writing, and arithmetic.",False,,c06z1zp,True,0,1231709472,harlows_monkeys,-1,-1,0

What you're spreading is FUD.

70%-75% of the Earth's men are intact. Circumcision is rare outside of the U.S., South Korea (U.S.-influenced), Israel, the Muslim world (68% of circumcised men), and the older generations of Canada and Australia (both of which were influenced by the U.S.). Outside of these countries/cultures, 'routine' circumcision is considered bizarre.

***----History----***

First, you must understand that 'routine' circumcision became prevalent in the United States not for legitimate medical reasons, but for religiously based pseudo-medicine and superstition.

In particular, circumcision was advocated as a way to curb masturbation, because such ""self-abuse"" was regarded as a sin against god and one of the main causes for all manner of physical and mental illness, including blindness and epilepsy.

In fact, one of the [major proponents of circumcision](http://www.circumstitions.com/Kellogg.html) in the U.S. stated that one of the bonuses of the amputation is the pain, because it serves as a corporal reminder of the ills of sexual stimulation.

This is of course all rubbish. For instance, studies have shown that circumcised men actually masturbate more frequently than intact men--likely, because of the constant (unwanted) stimulation of their exposed glans and remaining inner foreskin and frenulum. Also, circumcised men are more likely to participate in more exotic sexual behavior such as anal sex and fellatio, which is perhaps due to a sensory inbalance that requires a more exotic stimulation of the brain (note, this is not to say that anal sex or fellatio are 'deviant').

Nevertheless, once routine amputation of the foreskin became prevalent, the medical establishment sought to associate it with legitimate medical benefits.

***----Hygiene----***

General ease of hygiene was an early stated benefit of circumcision. However, the intact penis requires no special treatment. Because the nascent foreskin of children is fused to the glans (even up to late adolescence), children require only external cleaning (in fact, [forced retraction of the foreskin](http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/info/info-forcedretraction.html) is unhealthy and dangerous). In the adult, the foreskin retracts so easily, that rinsing during a shower is not even a conscious effort.

Simply put, hygiene is no reason for circumcision; the majority of the Earth's men would find this claim laughable.

***----Infections----***

Another often listed benefit of circumcision is the prevention of [urinary tract infections (UTIs)](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI); like most pro-circumcision talking points, this notion mainly came as the result of dubious studies. However, infants are at a higher risk for UTI in the weeks following circumcision. Besides the fact that UTIs are generally easy to cure and infrequent, the incidence of infection are roughly the same between an intact boy and a circumcised boy. *Moreover, the intact adult is less likely to suffer from a UTI than a circumcised adult male, likely because the meatus of the circumcised penis is constantly and directly exposed to the environment.*

More to the point, some doctors recommend circumcision in cases of recurrent UTI. However, there is no medical evidence to support this recommendation. Recurrent UTIs are associated with congenital abnormalities of the upper urinary tract. Indeed, the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Clearinghouse (NKUDIC), a service of the National Institutes of Health does not suggest circumcision as a prevention or cure of urinary tract infection.

It is also interesting to consider girls. A recent Scandinavian study found that girls and boys have about the same incidence of UTI in the first year of life. Girls have a four times higher incidence of UTI in the first six years of life than non-circumcised boys. No special concern is manifested regarding this much higher rate of infection in girls...

Why don't we alter the genitalia of girls?

Therefore, circumcision is not a suitable reason to provide for reducing the risk of UTIs.

***----STDs/HIV----***

Very recently, HIV/AIDS has replaced UTIs as the scare-tactic for promoting amputation of the foreskin. However, safe sexual practices are not only essential, but they are the only reliable and effective means for controlling and avoiding sexually transmitted diseases; even though the UN's recent (U.S.-led) studies suggest that circumcision reduces the incidence of HIV infection, the UN still acknowledges that only sex education and sexually responsible behavior (such as using condoms) are effective solutions.

In fact, [this meta-study of those UN studies](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/120747249/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0)  suggests that 72 circumcisions are necessary in order to prevent one case of HIV infection. In conclusion, the researches make a half-hearted endorsement of the procedure:

&gt; Male circumcision is an effective strategy for reducing new male HIV infections. Its impact on a population level will require consistently safe sexual practices to maintain the protective benefit.

To make my point clear, I'll point out that the last sentence states that 
*consistently safe sexual practices* are necessary to be protected from HIV.

Also, consider [this article](http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news-1/Role-of-Circumcision-in-Reducing-HIV-Risk-Still-Unclear-27082-1/) that states circumcision does not decrease the risk of contracting HIV for gay men. Then consider [the following study](http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/MeetingAbstracts/ma?f=102180172.html) that shows many gay men engage in unsafe sexual practices.

More to the point, the circumcised men in the UN studies are Muslim. No doubt does this cultural affiliation have an effect on their sexual behavior and would explain why these circumcised men are at a reduced risk of HIV.

Therefore, it is obvious that the UN studies are hindered by confounding variables and that the real solution to the spread of HIV (and other STDs) is not circumcision, but sexually responsible behavior.

Furthermore, the U.S. has the highest rate of circumcision among industrialized nations (not considering, say, Israel), and yet the U.S. HIV incidence rate is 3.5 times higher than that of the closest advanced industrialized nation.

***----Cancer----***

Another claim is that circumcision protects boys from penile cancer. However, penile cancer occurs in *old men* and at an extremely
small incidence. The National Cancer Institute of the U.S. expected a 2008 incidence of 1250 cases. For the U.S., that's rougly:

    1250 / 305186613 * 100% = 0.00041%

[Wikipedia says](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penile_cancer):

&gt; Penile cancer is very rare in Europe and North America, occurring in about one in 100,000 men in the latter. It accounts for 0.2% of cancers and 0.1% of deaths from cancer amongst males in the United States.

Moreover, it is generally thought that carcinoma of the penis is caused by viruses like HPV and other diseases that result from sexually irresponsible behavior and extremely poor hygiene.

***----Conclusion----***

In short, circumcision is derived from the true but misguided insight that removing a body part prevents problems with that body part. Yet, these problems are not inherent in the foreskin; in fact, the foreskin is valuable itself.

Just leave your son the way he was born: healthy and whole. Be open with him about how his healthy penis is supposed to function and teach him to be sexually safe and clean. Set it and forget it.... it's just that easy; most of the world agrees, as has the American Academy of Pediatrics since 1971; in 1999 the AAP strengthened this stance and the AMA recognizes that medically unnecessary circumcision has no therapeutic benefit.

You make a retarded attempt to demonize a dude who's owning you in  debate by making nazi references. It's Palestinian leaders including HAMAS over and over again promising to rid the world of jews, over and over again making comments about genocide against the Jews, and making no apologies for it. Indoctrinating their children into anti Jew bigotry in  their schools and on Palestinian  childrens programing.

Militant islam is what you're trying to defend, and there's no way you'll win any kind of argument with me trying to defend militant islamists. It's all pure evil I'm amazed that anyone would try to defend it.

&gt;1967 Borders?
You can ask the audience....

Negotiations for anything aren't going to happen without an end to the military activities against Jews. HAMAS is hell bent on eliminating Jews from the entire region. You watch, they wont stop attempting to kill Jews. 

You can pick sound bites of reasonable promises and niceties out of HAMAS statements, but it's contradicted by what the bulk of their rhetoric is, which is offensive, and by their offensive actions to kill Jews from within Gaza. That's why the IDF is there now. They're doing operations against all the rockets, mortars, militarists, and their extensive infrastructure that's been being used against Jews for several months now.

Ah, so you are under 16. Really no point in a conversation with you until you grow up a little, it would seem.

Your arguments make no sense - you really don't seem to care that Sunnis and Shi'ites blow one another up by the 1000s in Iraq and kill each other's children (since you seem to care for children). That 'tier of humanity', as you put it, doesn't seem too much different than the Gazans where Fatah and Hamas kill one another and have slaughtered each other's families. I wouldn't blame any country for not assimilating that kind of madness. Egypt certainly didn't since they never annexed Gaza when they controlled it from 1949 - 1967. Yes, they also had other reasons for keeping the Gazans pawns. Mostly to keep fools like you spun up.

Your anti-semitism seems to have blinded you to the rest of the problems in the middle east. You really might want to readjust your viewpoint to be less hostile.

Oh, and read up on Srebrenica and Sarajevo. Your beloved Europeans (Serbs) killed 15,000+ Bosnian Muslims in the 1990s. I have no idea how many Serbs were killed - maybe a good paper for one of your classes.

You can't possibly hold up Europe as an example - that is so outrageous as to not even be funny. Tell me again what countries were doing atrocities in Africa over the last century? The European wars took place within your grandparent's lifetime.

As to current atrocities in Africa, the Arabs in Sudan seem to be giving the Europeans a run for their money - 100,000+ since 2003.

Look at Iran, a populous revolution created a theocratic state were every aspect of your social life is controlled by the government.  how is that not a reflection of the culture of the people that live there?  the same culture is relfected in syria, egypt, jordan, lebanon...

do you think they are fighting for the rights of women in palestine? what about gays, or atheists? or mohamud caricaturists?  they are fighting only for their own rights.

&gt; Your racism becomes obvious, when you insinuate, that Palestinians don't care for the life of their children.

that was more of a joke, maybe a little dark.  i am sure like every parent those in palestine would die for their kids (unless they are gay).  but the truth is that hamas does operate within civilian centers, and those civilians willingly let them.  if i brought my kid to an army base and he got killed from friendly fire, or a terrorist attack i would be to blame (i understand the situation is to complex to be simplified in a metaphor, so i hope you see my point and not the holes in the metaphor itself).

i understand their rationale, they have no other political voices, nothing to loose and no one else to turn to.

which is exactly why we need to boycott the arab countries in the region instead of israel.  if there was freedom of speech and press and religion in the region, maybe after a generation reason would win out.

religion is the excuse that jews and muslims and christians use to act irrationally.  it doesn't matter what the bible or torah say's the nutcases will find passages to support whatever they want.  there are plenty of nutjobs in israel who build settlements in the middle of arab population centers, with no practical reason other then to agrivate the arabs living there.  but in israel people can tell them that they are crazy, and tell their government not to support them, and at snails pace the tide is turning against them.

The vast majority of people born in hungary refer to themelves as hungarians. They speak hungarian, they participate in the hungarian culture, they root for hungarian sports teams, they eat hungarian food, they listen to hungarian music etc.

A very small percent of hungarians refer to themselves as jews. Even though they also do all of the things above they don't see themselves as hungarians, they see themselves as jews.

The reason for this are.

1) Jews believe jewishness is a trait passed on from the parents (specifically the mother).

2) Jews believe in judaism.

3) Jews have their own culture and teach this culture to their kids.


My point is that people who do not teach their kids judaism or jewish culture will raise kids who refer to themselves as hungarian and not jew.

I think that there is always going to be a basic impasse between the religious and non-religious.  I want public policy determined without recourse to religious ideology, whereas the religious want their sect's doctrine to inform policy.

As we become more socially integrated, it seems to me, the only route is for secular society - unless you like the idea of a theocracy (see history and current theocracies to see how that *always* works out).  I live in England where there's a fair mix of cultures and religions and it's impossible to cater to the conflicting desires of Christians, Muslims, Hindus, etc., so government is secular. It works fairly well, although the competing religious groups are usually unhappy about some element of policy.

&gt; ...you are requiring my beliefs to operate under a function of yours.

No, I'm not.  I'm saying that your *superstitious* beliefs are not to be forced on others.

&gt; ...I don't believe it's healthy for any single opinion to dominate all the others.

It's not a 'single opinion', it's the culmination of a few thousand years of human society.  The influence of religion has been eroded over the last few centuries, especially the last few decades and especially in Europe.  Along with that has arrived peace, prosperity and social justice better than at any other time.

&gt; If I believe that the poor and oppressed should always be cared for and protected, ... I will speak out for those that are harmed in Gaza, or the homeless in my downtown area and I really don't care if you want me to keep it quiet

Strawman!  Also, these aren't religious issues - they are humanitarian.

&gt; I believe that the culture of capitalism has created a society where we are exploiting people for the sake of a material gain

I agree - and we're seeing the results now of the 'greed is good' culture.  However, this isn't a view that is determined by your religious beliefs.  It's a basic humanitarian, empathic desire to not see others suffer so that a privileged and fortunate few can live like kings.

&gt; ...there MUST be room for others to express their beliefs.

I'm not suggesting anything other.  However, belief e.g. that a god doesn't want people to use condoms should not be listened to when we have absolute evidence that condoms prevent disease and unwanted pregnancy.  And that's what it boils down to - the best method for determining what is true and what is not.

Wow, I'm actually curious as to what kinds of cars these generally were?  Based on the ""a few F150s"" I will assume you're in the US or Canada -- to be honest, my experiences on American roads make me surprised that there's so many fatal crashes.  Cars (even ""normal"" family ones) tend to be bigger, speeds are generally lower, and roads are wider than here (Western Europe.)  That said, as you indicated previously, 60-70mph is still a significant speed at which to hit something, period.

Switzerland (where I'm currently working) has a problem with young men, often-but-not-always from the Balkans, Turkey or Italy, racing small cars and getting into horrific crashes.  For a while, the Zurich cops put de-gored wrecked cars at dangerous intersections and notorious racing stretches to make it look as if someone had just wiped out -- only the absence of oil or broken glass on the road was a hint that there hadn't been an accident.  Some of these were so hideously mangled that I can't imagine anyone having survived the original crash.

Remember that a lot of pick-ups/SUVs do not fall under the usually fairly stringent safety regulations applied to normal cars.  the SUV and pickup truck started as functional work vehicles; your latte-sipping dentist in his X6 has little in common with Jose the Landscaper.  

Rather, if SUV drivers here are anything to judge by, he'll be seated high above traffic, feeling invincible, speeding like a motherfucker in a powerful vehicle -- which is basically bolted together without a lot of the stringent safety testing and finely calibrated frame of a regular sedan or sports car (for the same reason that you would never re-use a motorcycle helmet after any impact, I would refuse to drive a car that's been on a jig -- something that's been bent and stretched again does not have the material strength of the original.)  Mr. dentist's perceived safety makes him a less careful driver than the guy in the (better engineered but perceptually weaker) 3-series BMW, so he's more likely to engage in stupid behavior, leading to nasty crashes.  That said, I drive an Audi TT -- if some dumbfuck in an Escalade hits me, I'd rather he be my crumple zone than the other way around.

Another model suggests seven continents in total:

There are also other models, two suggesting six continents and one suggesting five.

Yes, I am in the USA, but I've driven all over the place, including Europe.

The main reason there's more American fatalities when driving is boringly simple - we drive a LOT more than other folks, especially Europe. The average American drives about 20 000 kilometers a year, compared to the 12 000 to 15 000 km a european drives. Not only that, a lot of our driving is on poorly designed and maintained roads, and then there's the matter of how we drive. 

But to your point. Here's an image (not graphic ) from a fatal wreck I worked on a few years ago between an SUV and a sedan, and a fairly typical sort of wreck. 

http://drop.io/redditcompare/asset/compare-jpg

While the damage to the SUV was extensive, the driver was totally unharmed, while the driver of the sedan was killed. The damage to the sedan actually wasn't that extensive (I've seen much worse, with survivors) but the hit from the SUV was a killing blow that could not be dissipated by the car. 

But...and this is a big qualifier - almost EVERY rollover I work is an SUV. It's almost silly - and put some snow on the ground, and they think 4 wheel drive is some magical road-grabbing technology that tuns the road and tires into a velcro pair. I drive a Jeep, with 4 wheel drive, and I've seen many of my ""sister ships"" go off the road sideways in ice and snow. 

Anyway, back to the smart car. I have a lot of respect for a well-engineered vehicle, as I mentioned before, I've seen Saabs and Subarus - and yes, the occasional US Made vehicle - demonstrate exceptional survivability in high-speed collisions. While I have concerns about surviving a wreck in a Smart Car, I actually do think that they have designed something special there and from what I can tell at a distance, it might have enough engineering in there to make a wreck a scary, but ultimately non fatal thing.

For more detailed arguments, I suggest you read a few books on Postcolonial Theory.

I am not sure how much more cleared I can make a source than by citing the author and the title of the publication. Do you also want page and paragraph numbers too? The two books I cited are written by respected academics and their correlations are backed by hard data and accepted as reasonable by many people in your field.

I wasn't referring to obsidian mining or only to wheat production, which was of low quality. You vainly try to detract with those examples from the industrial mining of precious metals and animal husbandry which took up huge amounts of human and territorial resources and which *in no way* existed before the arrival of the Europeans. If everything else remained the same, these two things changed the equation, leading to substantially more economic exploitation, voiding your argument of ""benefited as much under this new system"".

I have no issue with your portraying the Triple Alliance as a ruthless state, but your assertions of them being the ""worst"" is ridiculous for too many reasons to state. They did sacrifice and demand tribute, from our vantage point, that's terrible. Much like forced conversions by the Spanish (which the Aztecs have never been accused of, in fact, just the opposite) or the high levels of capital punishment. Their concepts of slavery were different and even their system of government was not based of direct descent, like in European monarchies.

Calpulli is a term used by all Nahua-speaking people in pre-Columbian Mexico, like Aztecs, Tlaxcallan, etc. I was using it in this sense, and it just so happens that it is the same sense as today.

As you stated, ""domesticated animals have been selectively bred for certain characteristics such as being docile, producing more meat or milk or things like that."" A tame animal has either been born in the wild, or just recently been removed (in terms of ancestry) from the wild, as is the case of elephants, and perhaps also turkeys and muscovy ducks.

World War I broke out in the summer of 1914. Within two years, Germany had won that war... the Zionists in Germany, who represented the Zionists from Eastern Europe, went to the British War Cabinet and - I am going tobe brief because this is a long story, but I have all the documents to prove any statement that I make if anyone here is curious, or doesn't believe what I'm saying is at all possible- the Zionists in London went to the British war cabinet and they said: ""Look here. You can yet win this war. You don't have to give up. You don't have to accept the negotiated peace offered to you now by Germany. You can win this war if the United States will come in as your ally."" the United States was not in the war at that time. We were fresh; we were young; we were rich; we were powerful. they (Zionists) told England: ""We will guarantee to bring the United States into this war as your ally, to fight with you on your side, if you will promise us Palestine after you win the war. ^ Benjamin Freedman, Jewish Defector


A ""protection racket"" is a scam where an aggressor instigates an attack, blames a bogeyman, and then offers to protect the victim from this bogeyman in return for money and power. The ""War on Terror"" is the protection racket. The aggressor is the world financial elite known as the ""Crown"" based in the City of London. Their instrument is the Zionist project, specifically the Mossad and its U.S. allies. The victim is the people of the United States and the West in general. The goal is the overthrow of Western Civilization, and the establishment of a world police state called the ""New World Order."" ^ Henry Makow


We implore and beseech our Jewish brethren to realize that the Zionists are not the saviors of the Jewish People and guarantors of their safety, but rather the instigators and original cause of Jewish suffering in the Holy Land and worldwide. The idea that Zionism and the State of ""Israel"" is the protector of Jews is probably the greatest hoax ever perpetuated on the Jewish people... It has been the age-old intention of Zionism to intentionally stir up anti-semitism anywhere possible, and even more commonly, to take advantage of any Jewish suffering anywhere in order to enhance its cause. Indeed, hatred of Jews and Jewish suffering is is the oxygen of the Zionist movement, and from the very beginning has been used to deliberately incite hatred of the Jew and then, in feigned horror, used to justify the existence of the Zionist state. This is, of course, Machiavellianism raised to the highest degree. ^ Jews Against Zionism


The League of Nations is a Jewish idea. We created it after a fight of 25 years. ^ Nahum Sokolow, Zionist leader, 1922, Carlsbad Conference


Now this exactly what the Jews have done, and so have saved Europe: they have been too eager. The first clutch was the Boer War (in South Africa) which put the World's chief gold supply into their hands. The Great War was their next eager clutch. The Bolshevising of Russia followed. Then came the clutch at Hungary, under Bela Kun, which lasted 100 day, then the clutch at Bavaria, which lasted three weeks. By this time the world is beginning to awake and the fiat of the White Race has gone forth: The Jews must lose Europe, as centuries ago they lost Egypt. They are on trek to Zion once more. They are Zionists this time, as they were when they trekked out of Egypt. ^ The British Guardian of London

&gt; The disengagement was not a result of outside pressure, Bush would have approved the Gaza settlements the same way he approved the west bank settlements.

No American/European President/Prime Minster has approved or will approve of any settlements in Gaza/West Bank or Golan Heights without say so from the Palestinians/Syrians. We are talking about the occupied territories not the Triangle in the north. The UN and the international community recognizes Israel at the '67 border. A lot of countries recognized Palestine has Gaza and West Bank.


&gt; There were no tanks in Gaza settlements at that time.

Yes there were. Gaza was being constantly monitored because the Palestinians kept on firing their rockets at the settlements (not has advanced has they are now but still dangerous). I think It was Islamic Jihad who got upset over the fact that the other Gazan Militants managed to destroy at least one Merkava tank so they set a trap and launched several RPG at the backdoor of the Merkava where the crew exits in emergencies. The Tank exploded and pieces of metal flew apart.


&gt; Evacuating settlements is difficult in Israel (politically), this is why the evacuation from Gaza is such a big deal (and such a huge missed opportunity).

The current prime minister of Israel, Olmert, promised to evacuate settlements from the west bank as well, many expected that he wouldn't win because he said that BEFORE the elections. He did win, but didn't evacuate settlements because he didn't have as much support as Sharon. The results of the disengagement from Gaza (missiles on Israel) also didn't help.

Sharon never planned on getting rid of the big Settlements. He went after Gaza and minor ones in West Bank. This situation is so stupid I can't I find it hard to believe sometimes. All Israelis have to do is do a Turkey and make law that says that the only parties that can have a seat in the parliament must have atleast 10% of the national vote. That would effectively nullify the settlers. The Parliment would be basically Labour and Kadima. That way they could evacaute the West Bank and the Golan Heights.

As a general rule humans have a time horizon of hours most of the time.  Attention and predictive accuracy falls as an exponential decay in time horizon - this is an experimental psychological result.  

When people do think long term it's hard for them to accurately or rationally conceive of time beyond one or two years (I suspect women actually do better because their reproductive role makes those considerations more important than for men).  From what I've seen, numerically, most of the world's human population doesn't plan beyond hours or days.

More often ad hoc/opportunistic/reactive planning in any case - get into a ""situation"", figure out then how to get out of it.  The known limits of time horizon attention pretty much minimizes SS as a strong influence on whether to have sex and thus of fertility.  Current perceptions of wealth and near-term wealth opportunities more likely govern most of it.

It's this same short-term outlook that allows law makers to blithely play with SS accounts for political purposes.  They routinely move money out of the SS account into the general budget when they need to justify SS ""bankruptcy"" rhetoric and then move money back in for audits or justification for non-SS legislation to make the general fund look lean.  They're worse than Microsoft's financial guidance games. 

SS is a cashflow system, not an investment system so the difference between current workers and current retirees is the largest account deficit possible.  Because it is always using ""today's"" dollars, it's relatively inflation insensitive - hyperinflation would be an exception but would be for everyone.

*There is no built-in compounded deficit akin to a savings account or the mortgage bubble or derivatives market bubble possible*.  This is a good thing and it makes SS accounting the safest and most predictable government payout around.  Even a simple insurance pool is riskier than how SS is designed.  What part of this do people not get??

There are plenty of other screwy things (government or industry manipulation) of markets that make the situation more complex but those same things make other already compounded or equity retirement systems like 401k and IRA even worse off.  The only real difference is whether politicians are playing with it or private business is playing with it.  

The experience of US health insurance should give some pause: we pay 2x any other health care systems (public and private) for the same quality simply because of inefficiency, overhead and built-in profit margin growth of having it private in the American form of private.
 
The Boomer ""blip"" is minor in the very long term, but significant in the shorter term as they are coming to retirement and death.  It's actually the co-trigger to the recent real estate crash.  Boomers as a cohort own more per-capita property than other cohorts before or since so they've created the glut of supply where there is no where near enough demand to clear the market.

Increasing affluence and security (often by transition from rural to urban living in developing countries) result in lower birthrates.  A lot of people have naive fantasies about bucolic rural life - most of the time it makes fertility high because it ain't no picnic in reality.

Japan has clearly chosen the ""Little Japan"" scenario - they'll be hurting far worse than most.  But they've chosen an interesting path: have you noticed all the robotic work done there (more than the US or Europe by far) and every time there is a story, there's a good chance the application is ""taking care of sick or older people"".  ""Big Japan"" would have required immigration to meet the demographic labor shortfall, but instead they've chosen robots over non-Japanese immigration.  Not surprising.

It's not that simple.

I think that if a peace proposal is on the table, about 60% will eventually support it. 

There will be elections in Israel in about a month. The next prime minister (if you ask me) will be Netanyahu (who is right-wing). One of his main points is that he predicted that evacuating Gaza will result in missile attacks. This is his argument against giving territory in the west bank (""they'll shoot missiles at tel aviv""). So no hope for peace with the Palestinians in the next 5 years.

yet they replaced one opressor with another.  all the countries in the middle east, although predomentatly muslim and arab, do have significant minorities of persians and africans, yet all of them are united by the fact that they all have no freedom of speach, relegion or press.  so, from now on, ill just refer to them as despotists.

http://www.meforum.org/article/970

now its a chicken and egg problem the government has absolute control of every social aspect, so its impossible for opposing view points to exist.  

&gt; No, they are fighting for their lives and the lives of their women, children, brothers and sisters, and along the way for the lives of Palestinian gays and atheists as well.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3211772.stm

its bad enough that people choose to be an illegal palestenian living in israel rather then being gay in gaza.  Iran, of course has no problems with gays, because they are all hung.  Their treatment of gays is not the cause, its the symptom of their biggotry in the same way that it is in the deep south in the us.

http://www.mideastweb.org/hamas.htm

hamas charter is full of relegios dogma:
    There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through Jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are all a waste of time and vain endeavors.

and anti-semetism:
    Their plan is embodied in the ""Protocols of the Elders of Zion"", and their present conduct is the best proof of what we are saying.""

to give them any credit is to promote that horseshit.  the only thing that could come from giving hamas any quarter is more violence.  intested of hundreds dead there would be thousands.

&gt; Why do you want to boycott those (resp. continue the boycott of Gaza), who already have nothing to loose and no one to turn to? It only makes sense if you want their suffering (which leads to radicalism) to continue.

i want to us and the west to offer trade for speech with every middle eastern nation.  if you want to trade with us, you have to allow freedom of speech and press, constitutionally and in practice.  

i don't think it has anything to do with relegion or race, every relegios group, even buddhists have been exlusionary and violent at one point.  my theory its just bad neighbors, western soviet bloc countries integrated into europe with the exception of belarus and to some extent russia.  eastern became despotic, despite all of them having more or less the same chances.

by forcing freedom of speech and press in the middle east, it would allow some reasonable political alternatives besides hamas and fatah, and there would be a chance for peace.

First off, the analysis completely ignores the reasons why the USSR actually collapsed. It wasn't because the state couldn't maintain its authority, but because the USSR economy simply wasn't a rational entity. Russia had gone from a food exporter prior to the Communist-era to a food importer by the time of the collapse. The only source of revenue that the USSR had was oil. And the invasion of Afghanistan caused Saudi Arabia to wage an ""economic war"" by flooding the market with oil and denying the USSR of important capital revenue. The end result was that by the end of the 1980's, the USSR was forced to ask for financial assistance from the West or risk famine. The political price of the assistance was Soviet non-intervention in the independence movements in Soviet satellites and Soviet East European allies.

This resulted in the Soviet hardliners staging a coup. But once they became fully aware of the situation, they stepped down and the Soviet Union was dissolved. And this dissolution wasn't a true ""collapse"", it was a government property distribution scheme gone wrong, as former Communist bureaucrats rigged the system and Perestroika-era entrepreneurs had an early advantage.

Now, a collapse of the US Federal government would not resemble the USSR ""collapse"" in any way. If anything, such a collapse would only improve things as it would remove the harmful effect of government regulations. There would be no distribution scheme to divide the population. And in any event, the state political structures would probably survive a Federal collapse.

The fact is that the US economic system is completely different from what the USSR had. And the fact that this ""analysis"" makes only superficial note of that and the vast implications it has, clearly shows that the ""analysis"" is a creature of fantasy and Mad Max movies, rather than any realistic and rigorous examination.",False,,c06zq3h,True,0,1231788284,Atomics,4,4,0

The Nazis declared the ""Germans"" a distinct ethnicity and race, superior to others, the Master Race and sought to make ""Germans"" into an ethnically and religiously homogenized homeland.

The Zionists have declared ""Jews"" a distinct ethnicity, a distinct race, superior to others, the Chosen People of God and are trying to make the ""Jews"" and Israel into an ethnically and religiously homogenized homeland by driving the Palestinians, the original inhabitants, out. 

Both Nazis and Zionists sought to create a larger socialist state where their are ""special ethnic rights"" for the favored people.

The Nazi's sought to create ""lebensraum"" or living room in Poland and the lands east to the Urals moving German settlers into the lands previously occupied by eastern Europeans. 

The Zionist are seeking ""lebensraum"" in Palestine and claim that all the lands from the Nile in Egypt to the Euphrates in Iraq were promised to the Chosen People by God.  

Both Nazism and Zionism chose simplistic, ancient religious symbols to rally the race and carry out a policy of ethnic conquest and ethnic cleansing.    

Just as Nazism was German national socialism, Zionism is Jewish national socialism wrapped in a theocratic state.  Both are based on a mythic interpretation of history, the Chosen People, the Master Race.   

In 1940 Germany invaded Poland and created the Warsaw Ghetto.  In 1967 the Zionists seized what are now the occupied territories and created ghettos for the Palestinians with their Apartheid Wall and blockades around Palestinian villages.  

Just as the Nazi's built up illegal weapons in their preparations for war Israel today has built up to 400 nuclear weapons and has refused to acknowledge them or sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. 

Like the Nazis the Zionists have had their racial scientists such as Elias Auerbach who wanted Israeli Jews to be ""politically autonomous, culturally whole, and racially pure,  and Aron Sandler, Felix Theilhaber, and Ignaz Zollschan.  Though Jewish organization here in the United States have historically supported unrestrained immigration into this country in Israel Zionists practice the racial policies of the Nazis.

Both Nazism and Zionism created conflict with neighboring countries and sought to dominate them and drive out unwanted ethnicities.   The eastern Europeans who were considered sub-human by the Nazis and the Palestinians?

Let me stop you right there. Government-subsidised or mandated Internet is *not* Constitutional, whether it's filtered or not. There is no provision in the US Constitution whatsoever that allows the government to do this.

&gt; Should we feel comfortable relying almost exclusively on private companies to help us find the truth, when we cannot know what version of the truth they are showing us? The former president of France, Jacques Chirac, was so concerned about American hegemony over the search-engine lens that in 2005 he worked with Gerhard Schröder, then chancellor of Germany, to start a European Union search engine. The project failed. People are happy with the commercial services that search engines provide, but it is hard to think of anything else that we depend on so heavily yet know so little about.

The author seems to be suggesting that it is an unfortunate thing that this EU search engine failed, because it would have provided a more 'truthful' or open service than the commercial ventures. But just a few paragraphs back, he listed off instances of censorship on behalf of several governments, including Germany. In fact, Germany and other EU nations participate in a *lot* of censorship, both on-line and off. This is well known. I have no doubt that should such an service have been launched, it would have filtered controversial information about [National Socialism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_the_Federal_Republic_of_Germany#National_Socialist_parties), the [Holocaust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_the_Federal_Republic_of_Germany#Holocaust_denial), [politicians](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/node/5928), [violent video games](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2006/dec/12/news.germany), &amp;c. Is that preferable to the way Google ranks information? Not if you ask me.

&gt; In the United States, the Internet is still the ""most participatory form of mass speech yet developed,"" as a federal judge, Stewart R. Dalzell, wrote in overturning an early Internet-censorship law. For the Internet to remain so, more legislation will be needed to guarantee its openness.

Here's the problem with that: As soon as you let the government legislate the Internet in a 'good' way, for example by requiring search-engine openness or net neutrality, you open the door for the state to legislate it in a *bad* way. The thing about government is that it changes hands. The person you like and agree with isn't going to be in office for ever, and public opinion about censorship isn't going to remain the same for ever, and corporations aren't going to avoid lobbying for it for ever. As soon as you give the government the power to control some aspect of society, politicians become a conduit through which any pet issue -- whether it's based on religious zealotry or corporate greed -- can be furthered. This is what's happened with education, with marriage, with tariffs, with farm subsidies, with copyright laws, with petroleum....

Right, that's the huge, glaring flaw of Austrianism that makes it a religion, rather than a body of theory within a scientific field.

Economics is far from scientific *at the moment*. That doesn't mean it can't be. What we need is improved models at the micro and macro scale, not pronouncements from prophets-on-high with their tablets of Revealed Truth.

For one thing, I am half-Swiss and live between that country and France, and have spent a fair amount of time in the UK (and all over the rest of Europe) in the past 11 years working as a security consultant.  I'm kind of sensitive to issues involving my rights as a citizen vs. the state, and those concerning electronic surveillance technology.

To use the example of CCTV, it is a plague, a cost-ineffective band-aid that does not, according to study after study, serve to reduce crime noticeably.  In itself it is not ""evil"".  However, it is a prominent avatar of a mentality that justifies the imposition of egregious intrusions into not only the individual's privacy but into the very fabric that makes a democratic government the servant of its constituents and not vice-versa -- well-meaning governments thus use threadbare claims about reducing gun crime or child molestation or some other bogeyman-du-jour in order to push for the imposition of ever more stringent measures that assume, at their logical conclusion, the guilt of the suspect.  

You mention Americans -- if you've recently had to go through US immigration or an airline security checkpoint, for all of DHS' assclownish incompetence, if you closely look around you during the process you'll note that many of the elements, ranging from the behavior of ""immigration officers"" to the very layout of the areas is designed to intimidate, to remove the motivation or possibility of questioning by the law-abiding but interested citizen.  This may not be immediately apparent as a UK subject who is used to it, but the British have taken over many elements of this with gusto (just using airports as an example.)

I'm not accusing you of this, but the ""slippery slope"" argument is a downright incorrect neutralization of objections to surveillance technology favored by its proponents.  One who is familiar with modern forensic technology is not so fast to brush off as technically impractical the all-seeing big brother state with everything that can go wrong in the absence of appropriate safeguards stemming from the perceived incorruptibility and dependability of technical mechanisms.  I've worked on projects riding on what were, to me, extremely scary technologies which, in the hands of anyone but the most well-intentioned, responsible individual, can cause severe damage to individual reputations -- and I don't want to be that individual.  

Equally uninformed as the rote-reciting undergrad Daily Mail reading panic-monger is a (English) colleague with whom I discussed a certain UK-based stock photo site's requirement of proof of ID ""because of government regulations"" (paraphrasing their mail.)  He accepted this without question.  Why?

In short, I completely believe you when you say that by pointing a camera at me or giving a police officer the right to frisk me just in case I might be doing something wrong, you are acting in my, and in society's best interests.  I just don't trust you with the power that this entails, and am frustrated at others' blind trust (or apathy) towards giving someone this sort of power.",True,,c06zwe6,True,0,1231801727,[deleted],3,3,0

Sure, an argument can be made that government spending will crowd out the private market, but all available evidence suggests that in a period of underemployed resources this is not a material problem.  The vast majority of economists who have studied the great depression have reached the conclusion that fiscal stimulus (and, eventually, WWII) were crucial to stimulating the economy out of depression.  In Europe, post WWII few knowledgeable people dispute that the Marshal Plan regenerated the European economy.

I'd say no. People forget that the Nazis were in power for a long time before WW2 and they were masters of propaganda. They targeted children heavily, with those indoctrinated kids forming their military during the war. These were the kids that ran the death factories and they had been told throughout their lives that ""the jew"" was to blame for everything. [This](http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/m/mills-mary/mills-00.html) page has a lot of info on how children were brought up to believe in all this stuff, it's worth checking out to answer the ""how?"" question of WW2.

However, that's not the whole story. Psychologists like Stanley Milgram have carried out research into how people comply with orders to exterminate people. They found that, consistently, over 60% of people were prepared to administer potentially fatal electric shocks to a vocally complaining victim. Of course, the ""victim"" was in on the test and in fact all of the responses were recorded to achieve consistency in the test. Refinement of the tests found that the key was in having an authority figure insist that the task must be done. These tests have been repeated many times over the years and the BBC News website even had mention of another set of repeat tests recently. Still, the majority of people are capable of torture. 

Further tests done elsewhere took random groups of people and gave them either a prisoner or guard role in a mock prison. Everyone knew it was just a mock event, but after a short while the guards started showing typical abusive behavior while the prisoners became defiant and non-compliant. The test had to be called off early due to the sadism of the guards. These were just random people off the street with no experience in prisons or law enforcement. 

Another aspect is conformity. An interesting test I saw had a single unwitting subject in a room, supposedly for some form of group event. The other ten or so people in the room we in on the test. Smoke started coming into the room through an adjacent door and the stooges had been told to *not* react to it in any way. In the majority of tests the subject questioned the smoke but did not leave the room to raise the alarm. Very few people have the will to be the first to stand up in a group and take the initiative. 

I've never seen any mention of this, but I'd assume that when choosing which troops to send off to run the concentration camps they'd be identifying the most indoctrinated ones for the task.

WRT to the rest of Europe there were many countries were successful in evacuating their Jewish populations and for those who weren't so lucky there was a lot of people who risked certain death to conceal Jewish families from the Nazis. However there was a base level of antisemitism around and that led to the betrayal of many but that could just be down to ""well meaning"" people appealing to the authority of their new rulers. People are strange beasts and often don't think things through. Plus, at this point the death camps hadn't been ramped up and knowledge of them was very restricted. Most people thought that deportation to Eastern Europe was what was happening to the Jews that were being rounded up.

Even following the war, most of the German population had no idea about the camps. IIRC people were forced to go to the camps to prove that it was happening, they simply would not accept that it had been going on. I think this is where the German laws against denying the Holocaust come from, getting a nation to accept a crime like that is a huge task. To this day, German army recruits are all taken to Auschwitz with the idea of teaching ""we did this, don't let it happen again"".


&gt; Certainly race, religion and nationalism played a big role 

It does in all those case, but in many ways it doesn't. It's just tribalism, we like to form groups and fight each other. Hardcore soccer hooliganism in Europe is an interesting one; these groups have formal contacts and means of arranging fights and when you hear them talk it really does bear a lot of resemblance to fanatical thinking. Pun not intended. Street gangs will fight each other over territory, often for nothing more than prestige. IMHO the answer lies in nature; we have the same drivers as the animals, each marking our territory and getting rid of anyone that's a little different.

Germans and Russians worse than Africans only because the Africans could not figure out how to control more countries in the continent at that time.  The intention has always been there.

In free countries you cannot refuse the importation of arms.  That is how countries defend themselves from outside aggressors.  Now, when those govts turn those weapons on the populace, that is a breakdown of constitution or dictatorships or whatever.

Either way, the guns are not the problem.  The people loading the bullets and shooting the population is the problem.  You see, Switzerland owns guns.  And the Swiss don't seem bent on taking over the Dutch.

If you are going to argue that they are not in conflict then I might ask why they are not.  They have learned to live with their neighbors.  The Africans have not.  So because we take this snapshot at this point in time when the Swiss and the Dutch are not fighting and the Africans are, then we should sell guns to the Europeans but not the Africans?

These cycles played out at a slower pace than our modern ones, but the Feudal world was only partially monetized.

This effort, which has reached a critical threshold in the past 48 hours, is part of the same London-directed global showdown that we see with the recent Ukrainian actions, aimed at creating a major European wide energy and security crisis, that could lead to a new Eurasian war.

""We have received credible reports that Cheney, in league with British and Saudi factions, is attempting to pressure the Israeli government and military into a suicidal extension of the conflict against Hezbollah and Syria. The broader purpose is to give Cheney the opportunity, during the closing hours of the present Administration, the justification to launch American military actions against Iran, despite powerful opposition from within the Pentagon, the CIA and the State Department. Such actions have been prevented, up until this moment, through a concerted opposition from within those U.S. institutions, as reflected in frequent public statements by Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Joint Chiefs of Staff head Adm. Mike Mullen, and others.

And Larry Summders was the guy who advised Russia after the break up of the Soviet Union... which led to 10 million deaths in Russia and the old Soviet Republics. His advice is to be avoided like the plague. 

&gt;In 1990, Lithuania, a restive Soviet republic seeking independence, hired Summers to advise on that country's economic transformation. Poor Lithuania had no idea what it got itself into. This was Summers's first opportunity to tackle a country in economic crisis and put his wunderkind theories into practice. The results were literally suicidal: in 1990, when Summers first arrived, Lithuania's suicide rate was 26.1 per 100,000 and falling. Just five years after Summers got his hands on Lithuania's economy, life became so unbearable under the economic transition that the suicide rate nearly doubled to 45.6 per 100,000, worse than any other ex-Soviet republic in transition. In fact, it was the highest suicide rate in the world, suggesting something particularly harsh and brutal about the economic transition in that country as opposed to the others, where suffering and pain were common. Things got so bad that in 1992, after just two years of Summers-nomics, the traumatized Lithuanians voted the communist party back into power, the first East European nation to do so--even though just a year earlier Lithuanians actually died on the streets fighting communism.

&gt;...
&gt;It was also the year that Summers, and his Harvard protégé Andrei Schleifer (who worked with Summers on the Lithuania economic transformation), began their catastrophic ""rescue"" of Russia's crisis-ridden economy. It's a complicated story involving corruption, cronyism and economic devastation. But by the end of the 1990s, Russia's GDP had collapsed by more than 60 percent, its population was suffering the worst death-to-birth ratio of any industrialized nation in the twentieth century, and the financial markets that Summers and Schleifer helped create had collapsed in what was then the world's biggest debt default ever. The result was the rise of Vladmir Putin and a national aversion to free markets and anything associated with Western liberalism.

The move by Daimler came as leaders of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition met in Berlin to hammer out the last details of a €50bn ($67bn, £45bn) two-year fiscal stimulus.

The carmaker’s decision – involving 35,000 workers on reduced pay across six German plants – sets an ominous backdrop to the coalition’s meetings.

The stimulus package, worth about 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product for 2009 alone, would be Europe’s biggest. Although the coalition leaders have agreed on the main steps – a €10bn infrastructure investment plan plus a separate €100bn credit guarantee fund for cash-strapped industry companies – they have been struggling to agree on tax and social security contribution cuts and targeted help for carmakers.

As underlined by the Daimler decision, Berlin is particularly concerned to prevent massive job losses. Officials have said the stimulus would include new subsidies for short-time working. One scenario being considered would be for the government to take over companies’ social security bills for short-time workers, in addition to paying part of the wages.

Although no agreement on the package was expected until late in the night, economists, politicians and business representatives rallied to criticise the plan.

The decision at the weekend by Ms Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union to push for partial nationalisation of large industrial companies should they become threatened with insolvency came under particularly heavy fire, including from some senior CDU officials.

Günther Oettinger, state premier of Baden-Württemberg, said the state “cannot manage companies. It is not qualified to do so, it does not have the know-how and does not have the personnel”.

Leaders of the Social Democratic party, junior partner in the coalition, also expressed misgivings about the step, although they did not rule it out. Hubertus Heil, SPD secretary-general, said there would be “no blanket nationalisations”.

The influential BDI federation of German industry said it welcomed plans for a €100bn “Germany fund” to issue companies with credit guarantees but “categorically” rejected the possibility of the fund’s taking stakes in companies.

The partial nationalisation of Commerzbank, announced was justified, the BDI said, “to ensure the availability of credit in the economy”. ",False,,c0708u0,True,0,1231844016,silence_hr,1,1,0

The thing with China is that - gasp - it's full of Chinese people.  Put another way, very little about the culture of China has changed in the last 3,000 years.  This is the same China that has struggled to be a world power since inception.

That China was a beneficiary (and, one can argue, a driver) of globalization does not change the fact that there is nothing particularly compelling about China that is *new*.

Yes, they happened to discover a form of free-market capitalism.  Yes, they have discovered the benefits of exploiting a peasant workforce (because let's call a spade a spade - most of China is still rural, despite what you see on CNBC et al.).  They even figured out that fixing their currency to the US Dollar would usher in a time of stability not previously enjoyed.

All of these things, however, do not change the fact that China - which to some practically walks on water - cannot escape the Business Cycle.  *Anybody* who is surprised that China's exports are declining - along with every other aspect of Chinese business (that's assuming the Government, which controls the release of such info, is actually telling the truth) has no idea how business really works in a long-term macroeconomic sense.  *Anybody* who does not think it's going to get worse - and by worse, I mean materially and demonstrably worse in almost every way from what we are experiencing now in the U.S. and Europe - has a real surprise coming their way.

Really, if you look at the chart what happened is Reagan got into office and the new GOP strategy of borrow and spend become the normal of running the government. 

All we really have to do is change our spending practices.

More importantly the US net worth is growing much MUCH faster than the debt. So even as we go 11 trillion into debt, as a nation we've gotten much richer.

The problem the feds having to manage the 412 billion a year interest payments wity only a 2-3 trillion budget, much of which is being wasted. 

Obviously one major factor is that we used to reduce military spending when not at war. But, as the military industrial complex grew in power we lost the ability to cut military spending. However, it still has to happen eventually. 

We have to have a peacetime and wartime budget differentiation. There is no real reason to spend 5-600 trillion every year when we have no legit enemies to even fight. 

Really there is no serious superpower that threatens the US anymore, why haven't we reduced spending ? 

lobbying, special interest groups, fear mongering and inventing wars keeps it all going.

The best move is to nationalize health care. This will knock America's 2.2 trillion dollar health care bill in half. Putting 1.1 trillion back into the economy. But you have to do it and demand the same prices Canada, Europe or Japan get. 

We shouldn't waste our time worry about pissing rich people off anymore. They had their chances to run the medical industry and we are paying OVER twice as much as any other industrialized nation and getting 37th ranked health care.

I wouldn't care if it was like 20% more, but 100% more for 37th ranked health care is insane.

One million dead versus 56,000 is a serious disagreement. That one million dead is a blatant falsehood.

I won't argue that it would be very unpleasant and unhealthy to be in a POW camp, but a 1% versus 35.8% death rate is a drastic difference. Any comparison between Eisenhower's camps and Stalin's gulags is laughable.

As for your claim that the US ""ignored laws"":

&gt;Given the circumstances in Europe at the end of the war, however, a 2,000-calorie diet, the recommended daily minimum, would have been impossible to maintain. The bulk of Allied shipping was now earmarked for the Pacific theater; only when the war had been won would supplies be diverted to Europe.

&gt;In early April 1945, the United States was responsible for 313,000 prisoners in Europe; by month’s end this total had shot up to 2.1 million. After the fall of the Third Reich, the number rose to a staggering 5 million German and Axis POWs. Of those, an estimated 56,000, or about 1 percent, died—roughly equal to the mortality rate American POWs suffered in German hands.

Like I said before, the US was suddenly swarmed with a starving population. The rest of Europe was starving too. Blaming the US for this famine is ludicrous.

In the winter of 1945, an additional 18,000 Dutch people died from famine in Amsterdam alone. You going to round that up to a million and pin it on the US too?

&gt;The worst of the famine was in the densely populated coastal area around Amsterdam (about 4 million inhabitants), as declining Nazi military fortunes (and Nazi indifference) cut the urban Dutch off from agricultural areas in eastern Netherlands. According to Van der Zee (p. 304), the famine winter of 1945 saw an increase in the death rate from 1944's normal 10 per 1000 to 15.3 per 1000, meaning 18,000 excess deaths.

The Germans had created a litany of problems for themselves:

* The collapse of Germany in the spring 1945 was also an economic collapse, especially of food production. Nitrogen and phosphates, the ordinary components of fertilizer, had since 1943 been diverted into weapons production.

* German rail transportation and food factories had been heavily bombed.

* Hitler did not want Germans to survive his defeat, and gave sabotage orders accordingly. (Some such orders were defied by Albert Speer and others, but not all.)

* The slave laborers who maintained German agriculture while most Germans were in the army went home. They were not replaced by returning Germans.

* Contributions could no longer be taken at gunpoint from occupied France, Denmark, etc.

* 10-13 million of refugees fled to western Germany from the East.

* The Soviets blocked the normal peacetime delivery of agricultural surpluses from eastern Germany to the west.

* In 1945, food shortages were a world-wide problem, not just for the Germans. Shortages had a special impact throughout Western Europe; in the most serious case, millions in the Netherlands were on the verge of death from starvation. Also, due to the continuing war with Japan, there was a global shortage of shipping.

* Even ""displaced persons"" (DPs), victims of Nazi deportations and slave-labor schemes (7 million in Germany, 1.6 million in Austria), were on short rations, despite the sympathy of Allied authorities. 

Some of those numbers you quote aren't even for POWs. They're for German citizens. The whole country was starving. Yes, the Morgenthau plan was stupid. It slowed the return to normal levels.

I don't believe in God.  I think organization religion on the most part was designed to control the masses, especially during an era when there were a lot of questions and little way of answering any of them.

That being said, I agree with you that there are the Jewish people ethnically where I stand.  Religiously I am Jewish, and follow Jewish traditions, but not so much *religious* traditions.  I am also pro Israel.  

Perhaps being there for three months made me love the country.  I do have a lot of family that I happen to be very close to and love very dearly.  I do want them to be safe and live in peace.  They all live in safe areas, while I do have cousins that are serving their conscription in the IDF, they are somewhat close to Gaza but is in a bunker since she works for the air force.  

However that being said, for the size of Israel, it does have a lot of corruption.  I don't disagree with that.  Take a small piece of land, and throw in millions of people from all over the world into it, surround them by people that want you to die, and Israel is what you get.

Yes Israel does have bigger guns.  They are indeed the bigger bully.  What is done to them and what is done back are not proportional, that is plainly obvious.

We all know that Hamas claims they are not anti Jewish but anti occupation.  It isn't just the west bank and Gaza they want.  They want it all.  

Israel offered MORE land than Arafat even asked for a Palestinian state, and he told Israel to fuck off (figuratively).  Arafat told the west one thing in English and told his people an entirely different than in Arabic.  Arafat is not a hero but he is a criminal.  I am not upset he is dead, though I do feel for his family.  I do not lose sleep over what the IDF is doing as I think Israel does have a right to defend themselves, but I do feel for the innocent.  

Just because you see picture one way, doesn't mean there isn't more to the story.  A photograph is a 1/200th of a second in time, a frozen capture of life that happened faster in a link of an eye.  Yet, something else could had happened 1/100 of a second earlier or even 1/100th of a second afterwards which wasn't captured on film.  If you saw that element, your entire take on that picture could had change.  

Of course film is available, but even film can be edited and see what the film maker or editor wanted you to see.  We all seen comedy shows that do that very thing.  Especially on Letterman where they doctor speeches and have celebrities say the most ridiculous things.  Of course it isn't as outlandish as that, but still, when you edit something, you are changing the context, no matter how slight; to tell the story you want to tell.  You can use the same footage and an Israeli story teller will tell a totally different story than a Palestinian one would.  

I am not asking you to cut Israel slack, but I want people to think more before getting so bent out of shape and venting and curing off an entire nation of intelligent, wonderful, beautiful people.  Israel is indeed a beautiful nation.  From the Galilee in the north, to the Dead Sea to the Red Sea in the south.  The Mediterranean Sea's beaches in Herzliyya are one of the most beautiful beaches I been to.  The sand is like walking on flour.  So soft, so white.  The water is crystal clear and blue.  Israeli culture is very European like, just as its citizens basically are.  

Don’t let the ultra-conservative whack jobs from Brooklyn that purposely move to the west bank to cause a scene ruin your image of Israel.  Because those few are not a good representation of one of my favourite nations in the world.  

Thank you for reading this if you made it this far.  Even if you don't agree with what I say, don't mod me down just because you hate Israel.

THAT story  went unnoticed by all the MSM, and is only BECAME ""important news"" when some catholic blogs got a hold of it and spread like wildfire.  The ""rewrite"" that is being passed around lacks so much context, it is almost worthless.  

Mr Djerassi, who besides being a chemist is also novelist, playwright and a writer of genre of science fiction called ""lablit"". His writing is not recreational, there is an agenda behind it.  In his own words he writes what he calls  ""verifiction"" about science. (see The Bourbaki Gambit or Cantor's Dilemma ). He portrays the politics and morals of research life, and explains the details of scientific advancements.  

Most of his fiction portrays how science/ research is misused, appropriated for propaganda, and the race to be published, even at the cost of accuracy has turned the field or science into a popularity contest, with science prostituting itself to prove the ""pet theories"" of the highest bidder....he must be laughing (or crying) right now with what has happened with his so called ""confession""  and other ""sound bites;  and how it is being used to advance an agenda that know one is sure he actually supports.  

He has been turned into one of his own characters. 

Why is NO ONE concerned or deconstructed the sound-bite where he calls for an ""intelligent immigration policy"" if the ""trend"" continues. For all anyone knows, desperate times call for desperate measures; with the catastrophic proportions of this epidemic it may call for  radical social policy-maybe he would support STERILIZATION requirement of all future immigrants.  
THE POINT IS NO ONE KNOWS AND ARE JUST EXPLOITING ANOTHER HUMAN BEING FOR THEIR OWN ENDS; no one cared about this guy before.

Even if he has sincerely repented of his sins and want's a ""do over"", to correct all the wrongs his research has caused-it can't be done.
 A guy named Nobel tried to do the same when startled by a misprint in a french newspaper-the obituary for his brother, accidently named him as the deceased, calling  him the ""MONSTER OF DEATH"", not exactly a legacy anyone would want.  He changed his will and the creation of the Nobel Peace (and other) Prize was the result.  And everyone realized dynamite should be outlawed-NOT!

No one renounced dynamite, but life continued and other scientists built on his work, making bomb so destructive, his imagination could not have even conceived of when he started.

It may actually be easier than you think.    if you are born there,  have lived in the area continuously for some period of time, or can show that your family lived in the area before the WWII. Then you must be given a citizenship and full compensation for your losses.  

An easy filter would also be that if you want to claim citizenship then you must give up any other citizenships you hold.  It would make sense for the ""holly land"" to have strict citizenship requirements that is equally enforced.
 


&gt; I doubt after all the wars, occupations, humiliations, and brutality of the Israeli government, the Palestinians are eager to share a government with their oppressors,

I am sure they wont want to share anything with their oppressors.   That is why as long as Zionism is the ideology of the state nothing would happen.

History is an interesting lesson here.  We know in WWI and WWII Europeans killed millions of each others  and in many cases their own citizens.  Now they are in a Union.   

&gt; If you remove religion, it will be ethnicity or language or whatever. 

I don't believe the root of the conflict, or the other conflicts in the middle east as religious.   Fundamentally this is divide and conquer.  There is oil under the ground which West wants, and it wants others to do the fighting.  The apparent oppressor in all of this, Israelis are as much victim of this as any of the oppressed groups.   If you remember the Afghan Mujahedine were the darling of Reagan administration.  Reagan even called them equivalent to the founding fathers!   Alliances change as politics change.   The current ""Judo-Christian"" values  against Islam that supposedly drives all of this  is about as much a nonsense as founding father remarks of the President Reagan.     


Also notice that none of these supposedly religious conflicts are being fought with arms they the groups either pay for or build themselves.   It is outside powers pouring in resources to take advantage of the divisions for their own agenda.

The key to any future peace (which as you said would be different than anything in the past) is to see that even the apparent winners are the losers.

&gt; I don't see how to do it, but removing Zionism is more than reforming laws or encouraging power sharing. Zionism is the sense of a people's aspirations as powerfully as Palestinian nationalism is in the hearts of Palestinians.

That number (which I think is in all probability 30% lower IMHO) includes civilian deaths. Mortality rates (especially infancy mortality rates) in post-WW2 Germany was sky high (one quote is 10 times higher). 

&gt; unpleasant and unhealthy to be in a POW camp

Why didn't the USA treat its prisoners according to the Geneva conventions? Why didn't the USA allow the Red Cross to visit internment camps?

&gt; but a 1% 

That one percent is almost certainly higher. 

&gt; Any comparison between Eisenhower's camps and Stalin's gulags is laughable.

Just because Stalin's gulags were worse does not mean that the internment camps of the USA was not bad.

&gt; As for your claim that the US ""ignored laws"":

It is not a claim, it is a fact. The USA ignored the Geneva conventions when they labelled prisoners of war as Disarmed Enemy Forces. 

&gt; The bulk of Allied shipping was now earmarked for the Pacific theater; only when the war had been won would supplies be diverted to Europe. 

**The “low calorie” happened in 1946 after the Pacific campaign.** It was the worst between 1946-47. (See above post).

&gt; Like I said before, the US was suddenly swarmed with a starving population.

Again – why in 1946 were the calorie intake so low? The USA placed limits on Germany's industrial production – so it could not earn enough to import food (such as historically was the case). 

&gt; In the winter of 1945, an additional 18,000 Dutch people died from famine in Amsterdam alone. You going to round that up to a million and pin it on the US too?


Again, directly afterwards I can understand. But 1 or 2 years later. 

Here is another quote:

&gt; The historian Nicholas Balabkins notes that the Allied restrictions placed on German steel production, and their control over to where the produced coal and steel was delivered, meant that offers by Western European nations to trade food for desperately needed German coal and machinery were rejected. Neither the Italians nor the Dutch could sell the vegetables that they had previously sold in Germany, with the consequence that the Dutch had to destroy considerable proportions of their crop. Denmark offered 150 tons of lard a month; Turkey offered hazelnuts; Norway offered fish and fish oil; Sweden offered considerable amounts of fats. The Allies were however not willing to let the Germans trade.

The original idea of the allies was to destroy German industrial capacity. 

&gt; The slave laborers who maintained German agriculture while most Germans were in the army went home. They were not replaced by returning Germans. 

Agriculture is difficult if you keep a significant population of the workforce in interment camps.

&gt; were on short rations, despite the sympathy of Allied authorities. 

Why were all of Germany's neighbours' nutritional state in **1947** to prewar levels and only Germany's still low: 

&gt; In a comparative U.S. government study[26] run by former U.S. President Herbert Hoover and published in February 1947, the nutritional situation surveyed in some of Germany's neighbor states (Italy, France, Belgium, Netherlands and the UK) was close to pre-war normal, while the nutritional situation for certain population groups in Germany (mainly children and the elderly) was disastrously low.


&gt; Yes, the Morgenthau plan was stupid. 

It was not stupid, it was evil.

&gt; the famine conditions were not primarily caused by the US. 

The famine conditions (in and out of the camps) was caused by US policy. The restriction on German trade and industry prevented them from buying food from external sources. The prisoners in internment camps prevented then from contributing to the economy.

Underlining Berlin’s concern about the erosion of fiscal discipline in Europe, the chancellor said she was determined to balance public-sector budgets in the medium term.

“We will have to borrow more,” she said. “But we must also be credible vis-à-vis future generations when we say we intend to repay this debt.”

Ms Merkel’s comments were made as she unveiled a two-year €49.25bn ($65.5bn, £44bn) package of growth measures, including public investments and tax cuts. These will raise the amount Berlin is spending to fight the economic crisis this year to 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product.

Under the constitutional amendment outlined on Tuesday it will be illegal for any government to raise the state’s public deficit above 0.5 per cent of GDP “in normal economic times”. For 2008, such a rule would have capped borrowings at €12bn.

The finance ministry is also to set up a “redemption fund”, with binding rules that commit the government to repaying the cost of the stimulus package by a set time. The fund would be similar to one created in 1995 to manage the repayment of the €171bn in extra borrowings linked to German unification – a goal finally met last year.

This measure could force future governments to tap windfall tax revenues to repay debt once economic growth reached a given threshold, Ms Merkel said. Alternatively, it could earmark Bundesbank profits for debt repayment.

Ms Merkel is keen for Germany to remain a fiscal role model despite adopting the biggest stimulus since the federal republic was created 60 years ago – and the largest in Europe since the start of the financial crisis.

Senior members of the chancellor’s coalition gave warning on Tuesday that Berlin was facing a borrowing spiral that would take decades to reverse.

“I am expecting a federal deficit of €60bn this year,” Steffen Kampeter, public finance expert for Ms Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union in parliament, said. This would be €20bn above the postwar record. “The government is giving the impression that it is again opening the deficit floodgates.”

With its fiscal package, the government is raising long-term public investment by €17.3bn, two-thirds of which will go into education. The plan also includes almost €20bn in tax and social security contribution cuts.

Berlin will set up a €100bn “Germany fund”, managed by the KfW public sector development bank, to provide companies with loans and credit guarantees as banks tighten lending conditions.

The chancellor described “the biggest economic stimulus in the history of the federal republic” as “a rounded package”.

However, many economists saw a loose collection of half-hearted measures designed to appease warring factions in the government. Thomas Mayer, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, said: “As political considerations played a significant part in the design [of the package], its effectiveness in our view is likely to be less than it could have been.”

Holger Schmieding, an economist at Bank of America, wrote in a note that Tuesday’s package was “a very mixed batch”.

The package could be diluted as it passes through parliament. Coalition MPs were frustrated with the speed with which they had to pass last October’s bank rescue measures.

* Israel was historically militarily useful to NATO against the USSR.

* The Holocaust shadows just about everything involving Israel; being labeled anti-semitic became a political career-killer.  When the [Anti-Defamation League](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Anti-defamation_league) (an organization that runs around calling people anti-semites, sometimes with quite legitimate cause) starts calling *President Jimmy Carter* anti-semitic after he [published a book critical of Israeli policy](http://www.amazon.com/Palestine-Peace-Apartheid-Jimmy-Carter/dp/0743285026), though, a number of people started to say ""hang on a moment here""..

* The US took in a larger number of European Jewish refugees than most other nations after World War II; this explains at least some degree in the relative amount of support.  Jewish cultural identity can (and has been; perhaps not as much today as historically) be used as a wedge to try and buy political support.  When Zionist groups were first putting together a bid to create a Jewish state in the Middle East in the World War I era, they targeted and tried to win to their cause Jewish politicians and other persons of influence in the United States -- rather than to allow more Jewish immigration to the United States, to encourage support for the creation of a Middle Eastern state.  [Lawrence and Aaronsohn: T.E. Lawrence, Aaron Aaronsohn, and the Seeds of the Arab-Israeli Conflict](http://www.amazon.com/Lawrence-Aaronsohn-Aaron-Arab-Israeli-Conflict/dp/0143113828/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1231889261&amp;sr=1-1) details this.  Palestinians, on the other hand, were a much less unified collection of peoples and certainly did not have this sort of directed marketing efforts in the United States.

* The US has rather more familiarity and cultural commonality with at least European Jewish culture than it does with Muslims.  For many US citizens, Islam only enters their life in the context of newscasts about terrorism, the Iran embassy hostage situation, etc.

* [Christian Zionism](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Christian_Zionism) (generally an evangelical view) supports Israel for reasons of Christian scripture.  [Example Chick tract](http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/1055/1055_01.asp).

* The US is heavily Christian.  Even for those people who do not subscribe to Christian Zionism, a huge proportion of people in the US have been brought up in a somewhat Christian household.  The first half of the Christian Scripture is Judaic nationalist (albeit for the ancient tribal kingdom of Israel, not the modern identically-named state) material.  Hear every day when you're a little kid about how God chose the Israelites as His People, helped the Israelites and commanded them to destroy their enemies and cursed their enemies and so forth, and just as policy on issues like abortion and homosexuality is driven in the US by religion, so too becomes foreign policy.  You also wind up with some [interesting business decisions](http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=46428).

* Israel today markets itself *much* more effectively than do a bunch of poor Palestinians.  For example, the Foreign Ministry was involved in putting together a bunch of content with Israeli military uniforms juxtaposed with [scantily-clad attractive girls](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtfPoGWS8jY).  (Israel argues that this is good for tourism; I'd say that it's hard to argue that one is trying to present the claimed ""peaceful image"" by stacking lots of weapons and military content in the material you're producing, but it is good for selling the military.)  Just as it the ""girls with cars"" ad sell cars for car dealerships, so can it sell other things.

* Arabs are viewed as a rather monolithic group in the United States (along with the Persians and some other people), as they don't show up much in US culture.

The area was a British territory at the time and there was a great deal of Arab resentment about these lands being occupied and divided up by European powers, and surrounding Arab nations attacked Israel in 1949.

During the fighting, several militias and Zionist terrorist groups decided (possibly with the knowledge and approval of the government, or possibly not) to force many Palestinians from the territory granted them by the 1947 partition, and there were several spectacular bombings and massacres to back up their aims. Many other Palestinians fled to get away from the fighting. After hostilities ended, Israel refused to let the refugees return, and simply stole their properties and gave it to settlers.

The UN passed resolution 194 at the time guaranteeing the rights of those refugees to return and to either their property or compensation, and Israel so far has refused this. This is probably the biggest issue in the way of settlement. Allowing millions of Palestinians the right to Israeli citizenship is seen as diluting the Jewish majority, and resulting in an eventual Jewish minority.

[May 17 -- Israel this week](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/17/AR2007051700419_pf.html) allowed the Palestinian party Fatah to bring into the Gaza Strip as many as 500 fresh troops trained under a U.S.-coordinated program to counter Hamas, the radical Islamic movement that won Palestinian parliamentary elections last year. Fighting between Hamas and Fatah has left about 45 Palestinians dead since Sunday.

The forces belong to units loyal to the elected Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, a moderate Fatah leader whom the Bush administration and Israel have sought to strengthen militarily and politically. A spokeswoman for the European Union Border Assistance Mission at Rafah, where the fighters crossed into Gaza from Egypt, said their entry Tuesday was approved by Israel.

&gt; &gt; How many people died because of this?

&gt; Very few compared to the 4.5 million prisoners outright killed in Soviet gulags.

I am talking about the number of German civilians that died due to malnutrition. 

The Russians treated civilians and PoWs worse than the americans did (e.g. large scale rape in Eastern Germany) but it does not make the actions of the USA acceptable or morally just.

&gt; I did?

With you I meant Americans. 

&gt; You're falling right into line with the original post: you're stereotyping an entire nation into ""evil"" for the acts of a few. 

Nope - you said that people who do not learn history are bound to repeat it. I just showed you how the USA is repeating the exact same actions it did 60 years ago (I.e. forgetting history). 

&gt; Maybe you'd like to see the whole of America starve for the actions of these torturers?

No - collective punishment is wrong (although Eisenhower will differ with me). 

&gt; I could throw every fact in the book at you, but you've clearly already made up your mind. You'll keep falling back on Bacque's arguments, no matter how many times they are refuted, because it fits what you want to believe. 

If we ignore all Bacque's arguments the malnutrition between 1945-1949 still stands. This was even confirmed by your government – look at German Agriculture and Food Requirements, Herbert Hoover, 1947. You can get it from here http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/marshall/large/index.php. Here is a quote:

(p.g. 7): 


“harvest of 1946 yielded a supply, beyond the needs of the farmers (self-suppliers) equal to about **1100** calories per day for the “non-selfsuppliers”. The similar supplyy in the British Zone was about **900 calories per day** average to the “non-selfsuppliers”. 

p.g. 9-10:

“In some areas famine edema (actual starvation) is appearing in the children. A study of groups of boys between the ages 9 and 16 years showed 5.5 lbs under minimum standard weights, with girls 5.1 lbs below such standards. Other groups studied showed even worse conditions. 

&gt; Yet if the US wanted to starve Germany, why did they create the Marshal Plan? Why did they let Germany recover? 

Self interest – to prevent communists gaining a foothold in western europe. 

&gt; You can't claim Eisenhower's misdeeds are anywhere near the level of atrocities committed by Stalin or Hitler. 

Just because his misdeeds was not as bad does not mean that it is acceptable. It was well after the war – he could have saved a lot of peoples' lives if he just allowed food to be imported and German industry to export.

Originally, Hitler didn't want to execute the Jewish population in Germany.  Before the [Final Solution](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Final_solution), the Nazis advocated the [Madagascar Plan](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Madagascar_plan).  The idea here was to exile Jews to some remote place (in this case, Madagascar) outside of Europe.  From their standpoint, this would have been at least as good (they got to confiscate their lands and property, they got to use the Jews as a scapegoat, and so forth).

(As an aside, the parallels between the Madagascar Plan and what Israel has done to the Palestinians really irk me, but anyway...)

After World War II, Germany didn't want its remaining Jews.  Most of Europe (Christian Europe, remember) had never wanted Jews.  The US took in *some* Jewish immigrants, but didn't want to take in a whole lot of impoverished refugees either.  Palestine was a fantastic opportunity to get rid of all of them at one go, keep Germany happy, keep Zionists happy...the only people who would take issue with the action were the Palestinians, and poor, not-militarily-powerful people generally don't have much of a voice on the world stage.

Think back to World War II.  Europe has destroyed its economies.  Conditions are rough even for citizens, much less supporting immigrants -- the US was economically mighty after World War II partly because the war had so damaged Europe.  [Switzerland took in some](http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/holocaust-jewish-refugees-switzerland.html).  The US had still incurred heavy costs in a war economy and definitely didn't really want to take in hordes of Jewish immigrants:

&gt;The U.S.A repeatedly rejected Jewish refugees and accomodated only some 250,000 Jewish refugees from 1939 to 1945 (0.1 % of the 1990 population), while Switzerland permanently sheltered 60,000 civilian refugees (0.85 % of the 1990 population) and 60,000 soldiers, most of them allied troops (amounting to a total of 1.7 % of the 1990 population). (Independent Commission of Experts Switzerland - World War II, final report, p. 167) Even Stuart Eizenstat had to admit, that the U.S.A. has accomodated fewer refugees than tiny Switzerland.

Where would *you* stick them?  Leave 'em in the same spot, and transfer the ones who couldn't return anywhere to the US?  Not a very popular move in the US.

Of course i soon found it preposterous that all these claims could be true and began to question the my default faith. 

I always thought of the miracles as being pretty much a matter of if a being like god exists then why not. Everything about it seemed so unjust, you were pretty much born into your religion, with virtually no escaping it. You could be living somewhere and never hear of god, thus never worship him and in the end go to hell? For having no say in the matter, not even a chance?? Some just and loving system. 

I ended up getting confirmed, but never followed the religion in any sense. Eventually i realized that i had no belief at all and that pretty much no ancient text could convince me to hold one. The idea of religion ultimately being a force used by those in power (high school history class covering europe) was my default view on them.

In general, most Western countries, both European and American, are not well-liked in the Middle East and Arab parts of Africa.

Much of the Middle East and Africa has been controlled by the Western colonial powers: Britain, France, Belgium. The people of those countries were being repressed, sometimes severely so: compared to what France did in Algiers and Belgium did in Congo (to name just two examples), the current Gaza conflict barely registers.

Through the later part of the 20th century, those classic colonial occupying forces were gradually driven out, only to be replaced by heavy interference of ""Western powers"", now including the United States. Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Sudan... it's hard to name a Middle East nation whose matters and regime were not severely interfered with.

This hits particularly hard with the Muslim Arabs, who believe (like the rest of us ;-)) that they are right in their belief and are the chosen people. If Allah is the one true god, how come its people, the Muslim Arabs, are inferior to every Western nation, which consequently treats them like pawns?

End result: the entire Western civilization is not well liked by most residents in the Middle East (barring Israel, of course). This ranges from the moderate dislike and mistrust of the average person, to the deep anger of the more devout Muslim believer, to the suicidal rage of the Al-Qaeda supporter.

Incidentally, Israel is hated not only because it's Jewish (most Arabs didn't know or care much about Jews before the end of the 19th century) but because it's a representative of the vile, ""arrogant"" West, constantly reminding Arabs of their inferiority.

It is no coincidence that there were expressions of joy after 9/11 among many Arab. These are genuine. And it's no coincidence many people in the West see the Arabs as generally unfriendly towards them. This view is rather accurate. If anything, a politically-correct attempt to mask it is deceptive.

&gt; The rage against the Jews that is exploding in Europe has been carefully nurtured; it is not spontaneous sympathy for fellow Muslims in Gaza. How else to explain the silence when Muslims in other conflicts, from Darfur to Chechnya, are being killed?

Yeah, because we Western Europeans stole land from the Christians and gave it to the Muslims in Chechnya. Also, a technologically vastly superior governmental army supported by the US and other western countries has turned a tiny strip of land in Sudan into a economically unviable city, a getto/virtual concentration camp.

Seeing as I don't really speak Hebrew, there might be a process I'm missing.  It might have to do with Ethiopian Jews being ""out of contact"" with a large percentage of the Diaspora so long - their traditions started to drift.

Phoenix Games Ahead of it's Time
With a small elite team of 6 people specializing in licensing, marketing and publishing of value priced games, development and manufacturing are bundled through outsourcing and collaboration. This approach suppresses our fixed costs and enables a revolutionary low price strategy.
We boast the shortest time required from development to product release in the industry. Ordinarily the average development period for a game is 18 months, whereas Phoenix need a mere 3-5 months. With integrated standards in production and packaging it is now possible to realize low costs through stabilization of variable costs and suppression of fixed costs. In the case of fixed costs we are suppressing development costs per product unit by maximizing the sales volume through a low cost strategy and also both diminishing advertising and promotional costs and maximizing operating profits by securing a dependable fan base through an identifying packaging of a series.

With long-term strategic partners based all over the world, Phoenix Games (Holland) B.V. is perfectly situated to be able to recognise and effectively work with the challenges of price policy, competition, languages, region accessibility and most importantly, to ensure a profitable relationship with its distribution partners.

Phoenix Games (Holland) B.V. has become the leading European publisher for Value Priced Games. To this end Phoenix has adopted for PS2, DS, Wii &amp; PC formats, a completely different approach to product publishing and distribution. Phoenix aim is to bring quality product to the market at remarkable prices, thus maximising sales for the developers.

Sony PS2, Nintendo DS &amp; Nintendo Wii
The complete collection of premium budget product on these fast moving formats will be successfully sold through the many thousands of retail outlets offering quick turnover consumer goods where the general public does its everyday convenience shopping. Such as 24 hour stores, Newsagents, Garage Shops etc. marketing the ranges through these diverse outlets means they will get high exposure and this will result in high sales levels. Although the ranges will be sold at low retail prices, they will not be short on quality. The retail price points are incredibly competitive considering the quality of the content. This, together with eye catching packaging represents exceptional value for money.
All product packaging and manuals will be available in 6 different languages : English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish, a further feature to ensure international success.

PC CD Rom Budget Range
Potential sales volume of software at this price point justifies the launch of this ground breaking product range. Never before has a large selection of PC CD-ROMs for Windows XP, 2000 and Vista been available at such a low price. Studies show that the PC games market is now sufficiently mature to make this kind of budget range commercially viable and Phoenix has been rapidly acquiring quality content to include in this range. Phoenix is leading the way with budget products for the newer PC operating systems.
How does Phoenix do it ?
Software Publishers are committing ever greater resources to an ever diminishing number of product releases. In commercial terms it is seem to be more prudent to invest money in the next Tomb Raider sequel than it is to invest in some new and speculative venture. Major corporations are solely geared to money making and sometimes lose grip of the nature of the creative enterprise in which they are engaged. The creators of original products are usually independent development companies that have a creative dream. Commercial success is important, but the product comes first and developers live or die by the quality of the product they create. More and more, the smaller developers are being taken over by large companies and there tends to be a vacuum between people who want to get involved in the games industry and people working on commercial products. The smaller developers have less chance to get their original new product to the market. This is the main strategy adopted by Phoenix, to give the smaller publishers their opportunity to launch their products at retail, with a high degree of success already assured.

The fact is that without Soviet involvement in WWII, including their continued fight with the rest of the allies after they had cleared their own territory, it is quite possible that the war would have ended somewhat differently. The Soviet war effort had a massive impact on the ability of the allies to carry out their campaigns in Africa and later in Europe, without that involvement the world could well be very different.

The soviet contribution to the war effort was tying the majority of the German forces and spreading them around Europe. Granted that was a very good thing they did for us but they only did it when their lives were at stake. They were the ones who took part in the Invasion of Poland and they never had a war declared on them because France and the UK found Germany a bigger threat to their Hegemony. They were the ones who killed more Poles then the Germans before the holocaust despite holding an area of Poland where the population was half of the German area and full of Non-Poles. They were evil. Has pure has you can get.

&gt; The actions of the Soviets in some areas was abhorrent, but then so were the actions of all the allied and axis powers in the conflict, most of them can be rationalised (The Bombing campaigns against civilian targets, Dresden, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Internment, pre-war and post-war settlements etc) but their effect of civilians cannot be simply discounted.

Hiroshima,Nagashaki,Firebombings of Tokyo and Dresden can all be explained and they survived purposes. The Ethnic cleansing and the mass rapes have no useful purposes and are one of the most disgusting behaviors people in power show towards those under them.

So please don't get sidetracked.

&gt;In the six decades since Israel's founding, ""only"" some 62,000 people (40,000 Arabs, 22,000 Jews) have been killed in all the Israeli-Arab wars and Palestinian terror attacks.

Those numbers seem odd...we know that over at least the last two decades Israel has been able to inflict many times the casualties it suffers - whether in retaliation or not - because it is massively more powerful than its enemies in that period.

Had a very quick trawl of stats, checking figures for the 1948, 1956, 1967, and 1973 wars only - because wars generate deaths at a much greater rate than any other time.

Couldn't find any figures for 1956 at all, but suggest that figures for that war were minimal Israeli deaths and Egypt more - but not huge compared to the other wars.

So the following figures exclude 1956.

Very precise figures for Israel - 10,308. Figures for Arabs were less precise, but are in the range 38,500 - 50,000 depending on whether you take the lower or upper figures for each war.

So in all the other low-level military actions and terrorist events he is suggesting that another 12,000 Israelis have died. It just doesn't seem likely, but no doubt someone can point to figures. My own guess in the absence of other data would be &lt; 1,500 - but it is no more than an educated guess.

I think it fair to say that the multiple Israeli actions in Lebanon and Gaza have accounted for a sizeable number of Arab deaths. 

The numbers are relatively easy to check (except 1956!). And I think the article's numbers are very flawed. Very sloppy.

Why am I posting? Well, it strikes me that Mr. Heinsohn, who
&gt;heads the Raphael Lemkin Institute at the University of Bremen, Europe's first institute devoted to comparative genocide research

is pretty slapdash with his figures. And that is a pile of crock.

Edit: my estimate of 1500 looks somewhat low and the (approximate) actual figure is 2500.",True,,c071bhe,True,0,1231957248,Iznik,1,1,0
business,t1_c070no6,,0,1425912513,False,t3_7krah,,t1_c071bwa,t5_2qgzg,"Yes, the American funding of Israel in the face of the blatant expansions of the ""settlements"" has been an insane policy.  Bush's policy of keeping mum while Israel invades sovereign territories in Gaza and previously in Lebanon, which Reagan did Sharon drove all the way to Beirut in '82, has been productive of nothing but another generation of radicalized hatred.  At the least, there have been some efforts in the past to broker deals that the current administration has essentially abandoned.  

Removing funding for Zionism, or in any event for the state of Israel ought to motivate any government to reconsider the outrages to the Palestinian people.  The current policy has undermined any authority Abbas may have had, and demonizing Hamas after it was democratically elected was imbecility at best.  

The completely plausible idea that Olmert told Bush to call off Rice and Khalizaid from voting for a call--just a call--for a cease fire in Gaza is an outrage for Americans.  There simply is no reasonable way to describe having the Secretary of State overruled by a foreign leader in a policy dispute with the American president, and especially so in the middle an ongoing bombing campaign that has killed 900 in a matter of days.  That half of them are civilians certainly points to how many combatants have been targeted, but that hundreds of civilians have been collateral damage, as the common term has become, is an outrage against which the decency of every human conscience protests.  

That it is also plausibly and widely held that Olmert chose now to move because he knew he'd have a completely free hand with the current president that he may not have in another couple of weeks points to the continued bankruptcy of our foreign policy.  There is simply nothing about this to be proud.  When Israel had tanks surrounding Arafat's compound, and had bulldozed half of it around him, there was nothing about the American lack of response that could be justified.  

There simply is no way to square our supposed respect for law, freedom, human dignity, rights, with our policy toward Israel's dealing with Palestinians.  Neither is there any way to justify our ham-handed approach on any pragmatic basis.  

I agree with you that nothing about this oppression has made Israelis safer or better off.  Every time the cycle of violence escalates to this level of death, it seems like another generation is lost.  Israel's response to the first Intifada, shooting stone throwers, breaking their arms when captured, was breathtakingly stupid.  Whatever hopes may have been born with the Oslo accords have died with the utterly meaningless respect the U.S. and Israel followed up with, and the ""Roadmap"" has been worse than nothing as it has eroded credibility on all sides.  

I doubt if removing funding for the state of Israel would push the sides closer any time soon, but I certainly would like to see it redirected from militarism to establishing real democratic institutions, hospitals, schools, and services the lack of a functioning government has bereft the Palestinians both inside Israel and in the territories.  The settlements very simply have to be dismantled; Israel has made merely slowing their growth a huge bargaining chip, and that's nothing short of an outrage to anyone who thinks civil society ought to be based on law, rights, responsibilities, due process, etc.  Promising to steal less of your neighbor's lands and livelihood in exchange for anything is absurd.  Promising to steal less of your neighbor's land and livelihood ought to be provocation for being bombed, not rewarded.  Like the gangsterism in Italy, if the mob-run enterprises promised to only murder poor people and steal from foreigners, the correct response is to still try to jail and prosecute the leaders and organization, not to capitulate, shrug, and pretend that that is acceptable.  

I don't think Zionism is synonymous with the state of Israel, and unfortunately the state of Israel is involved in a blatant and brutal domination that has long ceased to be about its survival.  There is no force in the region that threatens its survival, and no force outside the region that could that would bother to.  Their business partnerships that have grown with companies in Egypt, Turkey, South Africa and in the EU can only suffer for their militaristic ambitions.  It's a tax well beyond the costs of maintaining their military, and a worse tax on the very soul of their identity as a democratic, open, modern society, as much as it is a perversion of what their ostensibly Jewish identity is supposed to be.  

I don't think it's the Zionism so much as its twisting into a militaristic demagoguery, a brutal and power hungry attempt at domination blind to its own destructive--and self-destructive--tendencies.  

I am glad to see at least some attempts on the part of American Jews to undo the damage that AIPAC has wrought on our country and Israel in the form of the J-street project, and the public writings of others.

What does the US calling someone a terrorist really mean ?

Nothing, or it means you oppose us in some way. Or you're just Arab at the airport.

I think you missed the point here. Every admittance of guilt is a step in the right direction. Just because this didn't  break it wide open is far from a reason to conclude that it's a whitewash.

I mean, what you think has to be proven with evidence, and that evidence is not easy to get, as most of it has been destroyed. 

Much of what we need is in the hands of the people who conducted the actual torture. So... good luck with that.

You'll find in history, the rich powerful nations  have always committed crimes of humanity. 

No, Putin hasn't committed anything remotely as serious as the long list of US crimes, but Putin is just one leader and the US has had a long run in the top spot.

However, if you expect a nation to be the single supwerpower in today's world and not committ acts like that, I think you are very naive.

It wouldn't matter if it was the US or Russia or China or the EU on top. When you run out challenges, you invent them and that level of power and zero accountability just perpetuates you do whatever you feel like with no check.

Why doesn't the UN for instance occasionally make a stand against the US ? We commit the crimes, they ignore them. How could accountability every really exist in that model ? 

Is a frenzied public rallied and scared into war really supposed to ignore it's own mob mentality and realize instantly it must unite and protest it's own government ?

No, more likely nationalism  and zealous patriotism will take over. 

Well, you know, it used to be the broadcast stations were allowed to use the public airwaves and in return as a public service we got TV news. 

But now, it's all about ratings and the new is no public service at all, which actually is a bigger risk of creating apathy and division among our people, eventually leader to civil war.

I agree, they are at fault also, but I do think the majority of American's would kind of just blindly walk into human rights violations if rallied into a patriotic frenzy, just about every time.

We had protests of the Iraq war, but overall it seemed to, at first, have a majority of public support. Beyond that they censor public schools to not be too critical of their own nation. We rarely teach our kids things like Reagan's secret trade deals with Iran to fund the Contra's in murdering their political opposition. We don't learn much about all the times we armed Islamic radicals under Reagan's executive order we shipped 10 of thousands of tons of weapons to Afghanistan back when we were 'fighting' Russia for it.

But, then again that was a significantly different time where people still lived in an unjustified, but steady fear of nuclear war. 

Personally, I would stick to very modern human rights violation because things that happened during the cold war are messed up on both sides and the rest of the world just sat there with it's thumb up it's ass like usual. 

One unfair point you fail to mention is that EVERY time the world has a disaster the UN calls on the US's huge military to come help out, to transport massive amounts of aid and effectively gets us involved with every international military action on the planet. 

The UN does use us as the world police, I guess because we are the only ones dumb enough to drop 600 billion a year on military, every year. 

And there we are .. the military industrial complex is  driving all of this. A subsidized, high priced, steady 600b a year. Defense contracts get very rich, very fast. Their only fear is Dems will come in and cut the military budget.

Of course Russia wants to ""punish"" Ukraine for being pro-western through increasing gas price to European levels.

Of course Russia is ""douchebag"".

And Israel did not rule on the basis of race either, so why bring that up?

&gt;Of course, but is this justification?

It is not justification, it is a suggestion that people try to avoid complaining about others when they engage in the same thing. It refutes the frequent claim that Israel is the worst country in the world.

&gt;Additionally, referring to events before the end of WWII is silly. This is part of the problem with Israel, in general. The definition of the behavior of a civilized nation changed drastically with WWII, but Israel did not get the memo.

That is to say, now that Europe and the U.S. are not fighting wars on their own soil they want to complain about how people behave when their existence is threatened. 

&gt;For example, gaining land through conquest was no longer considered civilized or acceptable.

Yet you don't see a problem with the Palestinians and Syrians and Iranians trying to do that.

&gt;Amritsar Massacre and Concentration Camps

&gt;In an April 2007 article in The New Republic by Johann Hari, Roberts was accused of supporting massacres against civilians, including the Amristsar massacre, which he called ""necessary"", and British concentration camps built during the Boer War, using quotations from his books and broadcasting. Hari pointed out Roberts had addressed and praised the Springbok Club, a white supremacist organisation that flies the old South African flag and calls for ""the reestablishment of civilised European rule throughout the African continent"". The historian Mike Davis says of Roberts' claims that the British camps were built to protect the Boers: ""This is tantamount to Holocaust-denial. His arguments about the Boer concentration camps are similar to the arguments of the Nazi apologists about those camps."" [3]

&gt;Roberts responded that he had not realised the Springbok Club was racist[2] and claimed his arguments did not amount to a defence of massacres and concentration camps. Hari responded with lengthy quotes from Roberts' work which he claimed contradicted this. [See 'Correspondence', The New Republic, Feb 12th 2006]

Disclaimer, this was an internal tool, not related to anything even remotely important. It didn't go through the usual review process or anything, it was just this guy's spare time project.

A bit of a background, for historical reasons, all of our servers are set up to be in a same timezone, even though we have them both in Europe and in the US. Which sounds reasonable, except for the fact that the timezone is not GMT, it's, let's say, RDT (Really Dumb Time). RDT observes daylight saving time, which is the source of innumerable bugs every half a hear.

Now the story. This particular piece of code collects event times expressed as unix time (seconds since epoch) and writes them into a mysql database: 'INSERT ... (FROM_UNIXTIME(%s), ...)'.

Now by some strange quirk of fate, the mysql server timezone is not RDT, it's GMT (not sure why -- I would guess that our mysql gurus recognized that using RDT was a dumb idea). So, if you just do 'SELECT timecolumn FROM BlahTable', you get back the time reported as GMT.

How does our hero solve this? Of course, he subtracts the time difference in seconds between GMR and RDT from the timestamp before inserting it into the database. The smart reader already guessed that this would not work very well, for one because the difference is variable due to daylight saving time. But the real WTF is that you should never assume anything about the local or remote time zone -- otherwise, if either the server or the collector move to a different time zone, the whole thing would spectacularly collapse.

The third piece of the puzzle is the PHP ui, which does 'SELECT timecolumn' and then does strptime to convert it to number of seconds to compute the time difference (like '1 day ago'), then it does strftime again to display it as time, and finally it uses substr to convert YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS to YYYYMMDD. It is left as an exercise to the reader to determine what timezone the UI should be running in. :).

Now all this WTF can be avoided by (a) not subtracting anything in the collection code and (b) using UNIX_TIMESTAMP(timecolumn) and (c) using timestamp values everywhere and only calling strftime when the time has to be displayed.

Take this from a Chinese-Canadian immigrant: the greatest strength of America is its self-loathing style of introspection. It keeps you on your toes, and your systems from stagnating. It also keeps your people honest about the *actual* state of your country.

Just look at what your mainstream media is full of these days: fears of being overtaken economically by the Chinese, comparison of education standards to Europe, etc etc. Not a day goes by without me seeing some mainstream news media go off about how bad things are, and why it happened.

Look at Japan, China, and these other Asian countries. You will *never* see that kind of self-correcting introspection in the mainstream media. Everyone is all ""rah rah *insert country here* is so awesome!"".

I agree that the proposals are dangerous and, given the governments current inability to handle data, a major threat to civil liberties and privacy.  However, the bill in question will not be passed into law with:

*""No public consultation, no debate in the Commons, no vote by MPs.""*

It is a proposal, granted the amendment has had little if any public consultation, but it will go through the normal process for ratification in both houses.  I doubt very much it will pass the commons in its current form, even if it does it would face stiff opposition in the lords (and likely be amended into something sane).

In the shatteringly unlikely event it passes in its current form, the EU are likely to take offence, probably to the point of it essentially being overturned by EU courts (I dislike the EU and its impact on UK sovereignty, but I must say that some aspects of that undemocratic behemoth are proving to be somewhat useful). 

So in short, this is not yet law, it hasn't even had its first reading in the commons and is now seeing rather a lot of discussion in the media and public, it will go through the normal parliamentary process and it will face the scrutiny it deserves.  Just as any legislation, regarless of how flawed should in a democratic society.
