Only if you compare nameplate power capacity, *maybe*, which is meaningless since wind has a third the capacity factor of nuclear.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor#Typical_capacity_factors

E.g.:

$4.03B for new 1.0 gigawatt wind farm:

http://uk.reuters.com/article/behindTheScenes/idUKTRE4BI1V120081219

$5.1B for new 1.65 gigawatt nuclear reactor:

http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/08/17/europe/energy.php

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamanville_Nuclear_Power_Plant

But adjust for capacity factor: the reactor will average some 1.4 GWe, whereas the wind farm will average 0.4 GWe at most. So in this comparison, the wind farm is about three times more expensive in construction cost.

As for amortized lifespan costs, see for yourself:

Via the central bank and commercial banks of that country money is injected (as debt) into society to accommodate for the trading of those goods and services.

Here's a small example:
If there would only be 2 people and 2 goods in a country, the goods being 1 fish and 1 potato and someone would borrow $100 in that country's economy from a bank, then there would be 1 fish, 1 potato and a $100 bill in that country.
Consequently the fish or the potato would be worth $100.
The number 100 however does not matter here, what matters is that there is only 1 piece of paper in circulation that has 100 stamped on it which functions as a medium of exchange.

The problem however starts here. When the central bank starts printing 10 hundred dollar bills. Then the fish and the potato become worth 10 hundred dollar bills and thus $1000.
Technically the fish and potato have the same value, namely 1 fish is worth 1 potato when traded without a currency as a medium of exchange. However what has dropped in ""value"" is the paper bill. 1 paper bill is no longer worth 1 fish or 1 potato.

And that's the key between currency values. The value of a currency is measured by how much goods and services are produced by the country/economy of the currency versus the produced amount of that currency.

Comparing this to the dollar and pound means that the central banks of the US and UK started printing more money in the last period. Much more than the expansion of goods and services in their countries. The EU also expanded their money supply, so the Euro also devalued, however the US and UK printed so much more money in proportion to the EU, that the Dollar and Pound declined even faster than the Euro. That's why people see the Euro as a stronger currency, because with 1 Euro you can buy more goods or services in the EU than you can buy in the US with 1 Dollar.

So the numeric value of a currency is the proportional link between the amount of goods and services which can be traded for that currency versus the amount of goods and services that can be traded for in another currency.

All money in society, like explained in the example is debt. If all loans in society would be paid back to the banks, there would be no money in society. People would have to barter goods and services.(directly trade them)

Now you might ask yourself. If all money in society is a pool of loans, then where do the people get the interest to pay those loans? Because banks don't just want their money back, they want interest on top of it.

Here's the answer. Every year banks produce more and more money to give out more and more loans. It's called expansion of the money supply. That yearly expansion of the money supply is what people pay their interest with.
The rate at which the money supply expands is called inflation and if the rate of inflation is higher than the rate of expansion of goods and services, then a currency becomes worth less than before.

The paper money you know today was for hundreds of years something else. It wasn't ""money"" it was a paper receipt. 
When you in 16th century Europe went to a bank to store your gold there, then the banker gave you a receipt. People started trading those receipts for goods and services, because they knew if they went to the bank with those receipts they'd get the gold that was stored there.

However at a particular moment people started to notice that there wasn't anymore gold in the banks. The bankers stole the gold. People were angry, that the bankers did this. The bankers said quite arrogantly: ""Well, you may still keep the receipts"".

Those receipts are now our paper money. Which is now also available electronically.

&gt; Religious books are not the only texts that address morality and ethics. We have the rich history of philosophy to draw on, for example.

True, true. I was born a Hindu and still identify myself as Hindu, and if you are aware, Hinduism is mostly about philosophy, and I want to preserve the knowledge in these texts. A lot (though not all) of philosophy and religion are intertwined, and this is not a bad thing as long as the scriptures are not used as laws.

&gt; That sounds like the society we have today, or at least like the society most of Western Europe has today. Are you arguing that all of humanity, or at minimum all of one particular country, share the same set of moral values?

In fact, western Europe was exactly what I had in mind: an educated society which seems to mostly have been freed of religious idiocy, but do not bother preaching atheism either (e.g., the graphs [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_atheism#Europe) show that atheism isn't all that prevalent). I was arguing that some moral values are not be open to interpretation, and that religious texts, by and large, do a good job of codifying these."

In fact, the HIV epidemic in Africa is spread mostly through heterosexual sex-- I suggest you check out an interesting book called *The Wisdom of Whores*. Basically, you're right: HIV isn't a huge threat to a lot of Americans/Canadians/Europeans because it isn't very prevalent in heterosexual communities there. However, in South Africa, the single most dangerous event in a young man's life is to get married to a girl with a high viral load--a situation which is, unfortunately, very common and very dangerous. You're right in that it isn't honestly that risky for most straight Americans, but you're right for the wrong reasons. It's harder to transmit, sure, but it's also quite unlikely that you would run into someone (or multiple people) with a high viral load in the US within your dating circle, which is the main reason it's so uncommon.

Also the number of people killed does not a genocide make, learn some definitions, I already gave them to you previously.

&gt;These figures are hypothetical; exact population figures are impossible to ascertain. [source](http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570777/native_americans_of_north_america.html)

I find it hard to believe that if the population wasn't exactly known how it could be known the number that were killed. I don't argue that many thousands, if not millions, were killed over a period of several hundred years, but it still does not fall in the realm of genocide. Besides, Spain, England, Canadians, and the French all also had a hand at doing damage. I know you haven't denied this, but I'm pointing it out anyway. I would also like to point out that the natives did plenty of fighting amongst themselves as well, not that it forgives anyone else for what they've done, but let's quit pretending there's a good and bad side to all of this.

As for the biological warfare, I am also under the impression that there is no proven or accepted story of Europeans intentionally killing the natives with disease. It's a fact that many more natives died from disease than from intentional killings, but let's not confuse accidents with intent. It would have been impossible to predict, with the understanding they had of disease then, that the natives would be so susceptible to European diseases. 

If you're referring to the [smallpox blanket bit](http://www.nativeweb.org/pages/legal/amherst/lord_jeff.html), there is some truth to that, but not nearly as important an event, or nonevent as you might think.

A lot of the arm-chair economists on reddit screaming that the sky is falling are not looking outside their own world.  Yes, the U.S. economy is hurt and the dollar had fallen against the Euro, but now the Euro is down and the European and Asian economies are hurting.

The U.S. is not going to fall like Rome did because... the economy is globalized.  If the U.S. falls (barring any extreme violent events), it will because the whole world is falling.

A good investment right now would be in stocks or small-time venture capitalism.

Buy stocks that are low and sell them high (yes, I know you knew that).

Ford is looking have a positive net profit (right now they're living off of cash-on-hand from leasing/selling assets) in 2011 (http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081202/AUTO01/812020408).  They're working on the North American Ford Verve/Fiesta as well as a new line of plug-in/hybrid vehicles (the Ford Escape is one of the largest percentage improvements in economy from a hybrid conversion).  Ford began their restructuring a while ago (versus GM and Chrysler who are just trying to now but don't have the money and can't secure the loans [without the government bailout]).  I think Ford would be a decent investment.

Look at everything in the world and try to exploit ideas that will have future demand - alternative energy companies are looking pretty good right now (the green movement is finally gaining traction in the government).  

Stocks and investments are risky, so if you want to play it safe, just get a CD or online savings account with a high % yield.  If you ""invest"" in gold, you're pulling a risky investment:

The Jews had a puny kingdom that existed for a short time 3000 years ago which then got its puny ass kicked by all the regional powers. That doesn’t make it Jewish land! And there are strong doubts about the actual extent of Jewish ancestry of Ashkenazim, for example.   

&gt; Both people can exist on it. Besides, the evidence that the people who lived in Palestine for ""millenium"" is lax and contradictory. It is a fact that a lot of ""palestinians"" are foreigners just like we are.

Ok then, let me put it differently. The Pals are the descendants of all the cultures that have settled, lived and ruled over the region over the millennia eg. Phoenician, Israelite, roman, greek, arab, turk etc. That gives them a much stronger claim to the land than recent European immigrants with dubious links to the area.
 
&gt; If you do not live in a sovereign state with borders, and if you do not have a national identity, you are just sitting on a piece of land. You have no say who settles down next to you.

Actually by virtue of the fact that they have been living there for generations it is quite understandable for them to be concerned and choosy about who to settles in their neighborhood ( would you and your neighbours be perfectly fine if a crack dealer settled next door to you and opened a brothel?).  It also makes it to all intents and purposes their land. You don’t get to pretend that your own convenient criterion for land ownership is objectively valid. Most sane people intuitively realize the long history and presence of the Palestinians in the area makes it their land.  

&gt;Palestine was always occupied by different powers. It is historically unfortunate for the arabs of Palestine that they never had a sovereign state but they never even planned one until jews came, and they never had a chance for one until jewish state rose.

The Jewish state didn’t simply rise, it was imposed on the natives and most were expelled to make way for it. The Zionists created the Palestinian identity through their actions. 

&gt; Ideally every people would not have to resort to force to get what they want. Israel exists and any future plans should include that as a basic premise.

I agree with you but Israel must return to the 67 borders, demolish the settlements and accept or compensate all the Palestinian refugees. It should also compensate all the Palestinians for all the suffering it has caused them

&gt;Incorrect. They only started to protest when racists started spreading rumours and exaggerations about the zionism and jews, in order to radicalize the population.

You're incorrect not I. The Arabs were remarkably tolerant towards the incoming Jews until the Balfour declaration when their true sinister intentions became apparent.  

&gt;An injustice was done to them just after an injustice by them was done to us. 

Which one was that? 

&gt; Some of them were actually evicted. Some fought. Most ran.

Most were ethnically cleansed in a violent and planned campaign. Let’s try to be accurate here. Please go read the relevant works of Finklestein and Pappe.   

&gt; The was majority that did not now resides in Israel as legal citizens and wants no part of any ""palestinian"" aspirations. It is not being oppressed.

Those living in the occupied territories are most definitely being oppressed by any reasonable definition of the term. 

&gt;No. Post proof.

[Sure](http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/maps/1900s/1920-73israel.jpg)

&gt; The truth is that Palestine is not a small box from which you have to remove people in order to put in some other people. 

Exactly, yet that’s exactly what the Zionists intended and have done. 

&gt; It is the historic homeland of the jewish people and jewish people will fight to death anyone who denies that to them, even their own brothers. The tragedy of arab dispossession from Palestine could have been prevented if arabs didn't resort to violence,

The Zionists instigated the violence by intending to dispossess the natives of their land and creating their own country on it. They instigated the violence in their violent campaigns of ethnic cleansing. And they instigated the violence by finally illegally creating Israel.

What makes it Jewish land is jewish people's undisputed and deeply rooted cultural, religious and ethnical connection and aspirations to it, not a particular event.

&gt; That gives them a much stronger claim to the land than recent European immigrants with dubious links to the area.

No, it is a casual rationalization that is applied because it is currently convenient to do so.

&gt; Actually by virtue of the fact that they have been living there for generations it is quite understandable for them to be concerned and choosy about who to settles in their neighborhood ( would you and your neighbours be perfectly fine if a crack dealer settled next door to you and opened a brothel?). 

Concerned? Yes. Choosy? No. You do not get to choose your neighbours unless you live in a community with rules, in case of nations a sovereign state; if there are no rules, the only means of enforcement of your choice is might, which they did not have either. Freedom of movement, remember?

&gt; It also makes it to all intents and purposes their land. You don’t get to pretend that your own convenient criterion for land ownership is objectively valid. 

In absence of formal declaration, the only way to determine ownership is force of violence. This is the exact thing arabs tried to use and they failed at it.

&gt; The Jewish state didn’t simply rise, it was imposed on the natives and most were expelled to make way for it.

After they resisted its creation by violence, yes, though ""expelled"" is not an accurate description. From historical perspective, this isn't different from any other recently formed nations.

&gt; I agree with you but Israel must return to the 67 borders, demolish the settlements and accept or compensate all the Palestinian refugees. It should also compensate all the Palestinians for all the suffering it has caused them

I agree almost completely. I also believe Israeli businessmen would be smart to invest in the new Palestine as soon as things stabilize. However, there will be no return to 1967 unless Israel is convinced that there will be no more attacks. Otherwise, Israel will keep intimidating arabs until they renounce the violence as a primary tool of negotiation.

Whether these attacks are morally justified or not is immaterial for us. We had too much violence against us to care. Justice will be talked about at the negotiation table, and there will be no negotiation under terrorist fire. Hamas and PLO know this very well and used this to abort the Oslo accords, because their genuine goal is to prolong the conflict. We see this as aggression and an attempt to create war, and we react accordingly.

&gt; You're incorrect not I. The Arabs were remarkably tolerant towards the incoming Jews until the Balfour declaration when their true sinister intentions became apparent.

Their ""true sinister intentions"" did not include either murder or transfer of arabs. They did include a creation of jewish national home in Palestine, which I hold to be an irrevocable right of the jewish people that needs no justification.

&gt; Which one was that?

The arab riots which British refused to subdue, and which had every sign of the same attitude jews received in Europe and Russia; and subsequent invasion of 1948 which was intended to slay all jews in Palestine.

&gt; [Sure](http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/maps/1900s/1920-73israel.jpg)

This map, as all modern maps, falsely assumes that anything that is not occupied by jews belongs to arabs. By 1940, JNF has legally acquired 6% of useful land. The rest was taken when arabs fled during 1948 invasion, siding with the invaders, which invalidated any rights we would've respected. What you see on the first map is these 6%. Now, how do you explain 25% of arabic population in Israel?

&gt; Exactly, yet that’s exactly what the Zionists intended and have done.

Nonsense. It is absurd to think that jews would want to do something that was done to them for nineteen centuries. Select quotes from zionist extremists to support that notion are a bane of the uninformed. Radical transferism was only gaining traction after the very events you failed to name, and it was not in the end the cause for arab flight from Palestine - though it was, I admit, the cause for the rumours and panic.

&gt; The Zionists instigated the violence by intending to dispossess the natives of their land and creating their own country on it.

That is rationalization of violence. When violence becomes employed, reasons behind it cease to matter. We had every right to create a country, and arabs had the choice of accepting it or fighting it and facing the consequences of failing in such a fight. It is a fact that violence was unleashed by arabs.

&gt; Most were ethnically cleansed in a violent and planned campaign. Let’s try to be accurate here. Please go read the relevant works of Finklestein and Pappe.

Pappe's and Finkelstein's theories are only in part correct - there *was* ethnic cleansing but nowhere near the scale both claim; additionally, Pappe himself admitted that he was only interested in the ideological perspective of his works and not its factual accuracy; better yet, other historians have heavily criticized him for outright fabrications he relied on to create a picture of total and intentional dispossession of arabs.

I admit that I have not read either in depth. I intend to do so, my reading list is long.

&gt; and could have been repaired if western superpower wars didn't intervene.

PLO and the technique of violent resistance was created by KGB, through use of its presence in Egypt. Arafat was trained by KGB in the same type of ideological warfare KGB used to cause wars in other countries. The greatest ""palestinian"" leader of all times was not, ironically, a ""palestinian"" himself, and all of his work was always consistent with a single goal: *prevention* of meaningful dialogue and creation of arab state in Palestine unless such state could be used to consume Israel.

&gt; Your theory is utterly wrong again! But keep trying.

I still want you to say out loud that it is the arabs who made the choice to respond with violence.

&gt; I understand that Zionists give scant care for moral issues. It would explain how they commit atrocities against the Pals and continue to defend and justify it.

The people who claim to represent the ""Pals"" have indicated through words and acts that their final goal is not a settlement with jews but full recapture of Israel. They may denounce the legitimacy of Israel under international law, but that does nothing to actually alter that legitimacy. If they don't want to play by everyone's rules, we'll play by their rules: eye for an eye, until such time that terrorism stops. The ""atrocities"" are miniscule compared to virtually any major conflict, and opponents of zionism can never explain why they are so attached to this particular instance of mutual injustice and want to govern it by the rules they have never applied to anyone else. Of course, most of them are very bad at acting and turn out to be banal low intelligence supremacists who can not reconcile their own misery without having a specific object of blame.

&gt; Who says that? Many nations including my own (UK) have successfully engaged in negotiation while under terrorist fire with terrorists.

I didn't know IRA had as its stated goal installation of Irish religious regime over the whole of UK, and that it was enabled and directed by a foreign nation whose goal is to establish Irish religious regime over the entire world, and that it had underneath it vast body of religious nonsense that justified slaughter of all infidels in the name of Irish god.

&gt; Blame the Israeli electorate for electing the murderous war criminal Sharon.

Sharon was elected because Israeli needed a leader with violent reputation to retaliate against terrorism. This is the exact same thing that happened with Hamas. Irony much?

&gt; The Pals were quite content with carrying on the negotiations.

Which ones? Rabin's? Ho-ho-ho. Arafat deliberately inserted suicide bombings before every round of negotiations to prevent the implementation of Oslo accords. You don't cut the branch you're sitting on.

&gt; Electing a murderous war criminal who had recently desecrated holy ground was a direct affront and signifies that the Israelis were not willing for a real peace. Israel is responsible for the breakdown of peace talks and the second intifada.

I won't bother explaining you how ""desecrated holy ground"" is one of the recent inventions designed to keep the conflict alive. Suffice is to say, no one will be willing to concede anything when facing crazy fanatics with suicide vests.

&gt; That is very debatable.

As long as it's ""debatable"", don't state it as a fact.

&gt; The natives, the majority of the population, did not agree to the idea. They rejected it. An impartial observer would see this erases any justification for Israel’s creation.

No, what they in fact did was sell what land they got from the British to jews, and then demand it back with guns. Well, to be fair, the people who got the land were absentee landlords and the people with guns were the arabs, but if you want to go by modern conventions as you indicated above, that's a ripoff, and it was only enabled by British double promises.

&gt; Nonsense. The Jews in Europe or Russia weren’t trying to institute a pure Jewish nation there.

That's because Palestine is the appropriate place for a pure Jewish nation (and ironically, no one is ""pure""). Besides, in Russia a ""pure Jewish"" nation was created for them, by mass expulsion out of the sight of purer russians.

&gt; The invasion in 1948 was in response to the huge refugee crisis caused by the Zionist ethnic cleansing which was already under way in Palestine. 
 
It was not huge and it was not already underway. It was still a civil war which was against initiated by arabs as a continuation of previous violent conflict that was as well initiated by arabs, and from which people were fleeing. Arab countries didn't want any of the ""palestinians"" and turned them away. Their objective of war was joint slaughter of jews, so that Palestine could be sliced up for everyone's benefit. 

&gt; The creation of Israel also had no legal basis in international law and an act of flagrant aggression against the surrounding nations.

Wrong. Law of Belligerent Occupation (Hague Conventions 1907); also: 

""Article 95 of that Treaty [between Allies and turks] drew an essential distinction between the status of Mesopotamia and Syria and the status of Palestine. The first two countries were provisionally recognised as independent States, whereas, in regard to Palestine, no mention was made of independence nor was there any reference to the assistance and advice of a Mandatory. The article referred only to the administration of the country by a Mandatory chosen by the Principal Allied and Associated Powers, without making any reservation in regard to the character of the administration"" - minutae of Permanent Mandates Commission, June 1930.

This in turn is authorized by Charter of League of Nations, chapter 22.

British were free to do what they saw fit and what they saw fit was national jewish homeland. No amount of moralization can undo that.

It was also not an act of aggression against the surrounding nations, who, being surrounding nations, had no standing to claim casus belli; unless, of course, you do not wish to distinguish between ""palestinian"" arabs and the rest of arab nations, in which case ""palestinian"" national identity is completely invalidated with prejudice, again leaving us with a conflict of mights at which jews prevailed. Their war was a war of aggression with the purpose of annihilating the jews.

""It doesn’t matter, it demonstrates conclusively that most of the land that Israel now sits on did not belong to the Jews.""

No, it demonstrates conclusively that land on which the jews resided before 1948 was legally obtained from Mandate powers, church donations or purchase from arabs.

&gt; What are you babbling about? Most of them were forcefully evicted in a deliberate campaign of ethnic cleansing.

And your proof of that is of course Ilan Pappe, who admitted that he composed his entire theory to fit a premeditated agenda?

&gt; History records that that is exactly what happened. Your incredulity cannot stand as an argument.

Which history would that be, then?

&gt; &gt; That is rationalization of violence. When violence becomes employed, reasons behind it cease to matter.
&gt; What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Stop talking in riddles.

It is supposed to mean that, when you initiate aggression, you bear the consequences. In cases of war, you bear it with your own life.

&gt; That is what you keep repeating but there does not seem to be any persuasive reason to think so

The British had legal standing to turn over the country to the jews. Jews legally purchased lands from arabs beyond those received from the British. Jews also have a deep intrinsic connection to the land that drove them there in the first place. Which part of this is not persuasive to you?

&gt; Nonsense, the forceful and unconsensual imposition of a Jewish state by European immigrant on the Arabs was unjustifiable regardless of whether the Pals picked up arms to defend their rights or not.

It was certainly justifiable by international law, and also by persecution of expulsion of jews in arab countries, in Europe and Russia, and especially so by Palestine civil war and 1948.

&gt; No, it isn’t. Sorry to disappoint you.

Yes, it is. There was no serial violence between jews and arabs in Palestine before the Husseini riots, and Husseini riots were slaughter of jews by arabs.

&gt; Well, then their arguments and conclusions stand until you do read them in more depth.

No. If you want to use them as a base for discussion, you will have to either wait until I read them, or show me how they are composed and what are their major conclusions so that I can refute them.

&gt; I have no time for kooky conspiracy theories.

It is not a kooky conspiracy theory. Go to the WSJ site and search for Ian Pacepa. Russians decided to enter the Middle East in the fifties to counter the perceived american threat. Cairo-born Arafat was shipped to Moscow from Egypt, where he was born (so much for ""palestinian"" nationalism) where he studied and was recruited by KGB, by confession of then chief of Romanian intelligence service who was on KGB's payroll. Russians had strong presence of ""military advisors"" in Egypt, and they are the ones who enabled Egypt to attack Israel militarily in the first place. In seventies, Israel has conducted special operations to steal and analyze classified military equipment from Egypt that was made by russians. When he returned to middle east, he became a ""palestinian"" nationalist, and founded PLO with KGB's funding. This is also the exact point at which the idea that ""palestinians"" are descendants of biblic philistines emerged, as a rationalization to reinvigorate the struggle of arabs against Israel.

&gt; You can sing it from the mountain tops but it doesn’t make it true.

Then I will for the fifth time ask you to name me the exact point at which the relation between arabs in Palestine and jewish immigrants became violent.

Obviously 'reasonable' here highly dependent on the citizen's circumstances and the acts engaged in by the state.

I can understand that as an individual moving against the status quo, it may not feel like any positive outcome is likely. However, no action will definitely fail to improve the situation. Reasonable actions would be to consistently write to your 'representatives' to show that you actually care about the things that they do in your name, and argue your position with others to get them involved as well. This is why people here (on both sides) are arguing their positions.

The involvement in policy discussion by citizens is essential for a functioning democracy; it seems that all our Western governments are more elected dictatorships than true democracies - since participation by the people (except at election time) is not appreciated. I'll add that while I don't have much time for the US, I have a great deal of respect for the stated philosophical positions of some of the people involved in establishing the US - particularly Paine and Jefferson (and later Thoreau) who held a similar position to the one I have stated above - these all argued for various levels of civil disobedience (if you disagree with policies, don't break the law, but make the state's life as difficult as possible).

I understand the difficulties that a single person would face (particularly in the US where the electoral system seems - and probably was - designed to prevent actual democracy of the masses) in standing against wrongs by the state. But to not act leaves a person tainted  - just think about how people asked how it was possible for good people in various dictatorships to allow them to continue (Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, East Germany, most of Eastern Europe etc.).

Edit response to late additions:
I agree that you weren't involved in setting up the system, but other nations (New Zealand for example) have found that they are able to address issues of disenfranchisement by revising the electoral system, something that has resulted in a much greater level of citizen involvement. Failing to change something is an act of complicity. "

Hoppe does make the convincing argument that as far as governments go, a limited monarchy in which the king or queen has only the royal estate to spend for government finances and war and must keep the nation in good condition to pass down to his or her heirs tends to protect personal liberties much better than democracy. He makes this observation while comparing the monarchies of Europe pre-WW1 to its democracies post-WW1.

Aristotle also lived in a unique time and civilization where numerous variations of both monarchy and democracy were in practice, depending on the city-state. I believe he also noted that 20,000 people was about the ideal population for a country. It would have been plain to him that majoritarian rule in an empire of 300 million people would never respect human liberties."

You are saying that since Americans eats the most, they are the wealthiest, they are the most important. It's not true. The numbers are lying to you because you haven't dug deep enough to figure out what the numbers really mean.

Macroeconomic statistics like GDP are very very easy to misinterpret. These misinterpretations are the foundation of economic ignorance in the first world. America has the identical problem to Europe, Canada and Australia. 

I may be patronizing and offensive and for that I am sorry, I don't want to make enemies. However, ignorant is ignorant. I think you are a valuable person and I think your misunderstanding is extremely common, and common to all people who get their information from the mainstream media and even popular books on economics. The problem is just that they are the wrong books.

You gotta start at the very bottom if you want to intellectually understand what is really going on. It is hard to do it intellectually, much easier to do it logically using a simple argument like I made about the desert island. If you don't understand macroeconomic theory and the various schools to their core, you are just going to confuse yourself.

Sound macroeconomics has it's basis in fungible microeconomics. People seeking to understand economics logically need to understand that it is the relationships that matter and not the content. GDP itself isn't important, what is important is the relation that GDP has to standard of living. This is a question you need to ask yourself."

Ala. Doctor Reactivated for Iraq War at 68

Posted on: Monday, 19 July 2004, 06:00 CDT

DECATUR, Ala. - At 68, many people are slowing down. Not John Wicks: He's going to Iraq. Wicks, a psychiatrist, has been called out of military retirement by the Army to fill a shortage of mental health experts needed to help soldiers cope with combat. He could be gone as long as a year.

The Army hasn't told Wicks what his exact assignment in Iraq is, or where in the country it will send him.

""I believe that the morale in general is not that good since the scandal at that prison,"" he said, referring to the allegations of abuse at Abu Ghraib prison. ""When morale is high, you have fewer of these kinds of problems. And when morale is low you have more.""

Wicks, who is beginning a week of training in Texas, will have the rank of colonel. His previous military experience includes two years active duty with the Marines and 18 years in the Alabama National Guard.

Wicks is a veteran of the U.S. war with Iraq in 1991, but his wife said things are different this time.

""In Desert Storm, he was in the 109th Evacuation Hospital and they had drilled together for years,"" said Jan Wicks. ""He felt good about going with this team that he knew. He doesn't have that support this time.""

Wicks figures he will be among the oldest U.S. soldiers in the Iraq war. Martha Rudd, a spokeswoman for the Army at the Pentagon, said she has no way of knowing if Wicks would be the oldest. She said she had heard of one other doctor who was 68 and went to Iraq.

Wicks' latest assignment started with a postcard the Army sent last fall that explained the need for specialists and asked if he felt he was fit to serve.

""I stuck the thing in my pocket and carried it around for several weeks agonizing on how I should respond,"" he told The Decatur Daily in a story Sunday. ""The truth is I consider myself fit to serve, so that's how I marked it and sent it back.""

""My wife said 'You'll never hear from them.' Well, it was no time at all till I heard from them,"" Wicks said.

Wicks said recruiters initially hinted he could go to Europe or a stateside base to relieve a younger psychiatrist who would go to Iraq. The Army even gave him three choices should that scenario play out, and Dr. Wicks chose Italy, Germany and England.

""Well, I now wonder if this was just to get me hooked. Because there's no way I'm going to Italy or any of these places,"" he said. ""I'm going to Iraq."" "

You will hold a 14 year old in prison for a life sentence for first degree murder or involuntary manslaughter which he/she is perfectly capable of being mature enough to commit but you won't let a 14 year old have consentual sex with another consenting adult/minor who is 4 years older than the younger member? Sort of a twisted way to see responsibility don't you think?

America has a most twisted psyche when it comes to violence and sex. Violence is ok while sex is forbidden.

High infant mortality rate, high teenage pregnancy and high gun crimes don't make a culture a good one. Have a gander over to Europe. The only country which is almost as fucked up and twisted is England which has some of its own issues to deal with (teen pregnancy).

And dude: get off your fucking high horse for your own sake. 16 or 14 is pretty normal of a time to lose your virginity and well...also have a lot of partners. You may not like that (I don't) but you will have to live with it.

All cultures have it, all people have it, and this is where science comes from.

Now of course, there is a cultural explanation for the fact that science was born in the India/Orient/Europe cultural continuum. The explanation is that these people had numbers on their side: they were a very large pool of humans with relatively easy methods of communication. This enabled them to spread information about how to avoid cultural and cognitive biases, as well as how to properly isolate factors from each other. They were lucky to have the means to do this, but the goal, as opposed to the means, was everybody's.

And this works with individuals too, not just with cultures. Even those people who don't know science (i.e., most of them in all cultures) want to understand what is going on in the world. Everywhere. And they want to understand it correctly and not wrongly."

Point 5.) As the Federal sanctions become more severe these states will eventually become unofficialy  dependant on foreign entities [governmental and commercial] (and will actually be recieving better deals). These states will no longer need the Federal government for any tangible reason.

Point 6.) These states will enforce their own borders to keep out refugees (residents) from other states becuase of a lack of resources to go around. These states will eventually quit paying dues and taxes--due to no longer recieveing help from the federal govenment and an inability to pay.

I actually find it somewhat plausible. 

But I have a little more distance. Whenever I see war or violence, what I see is two or more nationalistic cultures oppressing _their own_ people into violence.

Although I tend to think that the Israeli's have the upper hand in the last 20 years, their play is understandable (not excusable!) given the history. 

It's funny how the americans always get blamed for helping Israel, instead of Europeans (i'm dutch) for creating this monster. If Israel is frankenstein, we are its Dr. Frankenstein.

The underlining issue however, is no different from what started the first world war, which lead to the second, which led to Israel.  It's the idea of nation-state. One nation - one state - one shared identity.

It doesn't mix with morale of individual actions. The grey area between the cultural identity and responsibility and the individual identity and responsibility contains the logic of killing innocent people for being part of the larger cultural identity.

But currently, I don't see the nation-state idea going away; although over time; i'm sure globalisation will destroy it. (at it's own price off course).

What you as a person as a can do, is get rid of any flag any national symbol and tell yourself you are your own person. If you don't want to be responsible for ANY action your country does in your name. Stop being part of that country. I'm saying break the rules. I'm say _forget_ them. 

In my opinion, very few israelites or palestines can be considered innocent. Although I think they can all be forgiven for what they have let themselves and their families become. It hasn't been easy for anybody over there. I'm not sure I would have the strength to be bigger.

My initial reaction was to the video was 'what the fuck did israel do?' ... but then I remembered. They didn't have a poll in Israel about this attack. I'm not even sure 'the people' have all the facts. I'm not even sure the governments do. And some will hate, yes. Should we blame them? I think so. But it won't change anything. Hate is like the economy, more pointing figures leads to more pointings fingers. One bomb is like a big moral investement into hate. And that will trickle down and spread around.

Don't bite. Don't acknowledge. We don't know the individuals that did this. We don't know the individuals that this has been done to. We can estimate a moral convinction, but should we? What good will it do?"

Israel, the US, and the EU are trying to stop the flow of funds to Hamas. Those efforts are met with partial success, much like the efforts to stop the flow of weapons.

Hamas is a large organization, with vast support networks throughout the world. It's disheartening to see it become the pet cause of so many Islamic organizations, some of which are ostensibly moderate. But that's exactly what's happening. Just last month a very large US charity was found to have transferred funds to Hamas:

Then again, you see so much support for Hamas even here on Reddit. That's a movement that supports Islamic revolution, killing all infidels, and Sharia law. And all those demonstrations you see in Europe?  Watch closer. That green flag is the flag of Hamas. They are demonstrating for global Jihad and Sharia law.

Anyway, I digress. Of course Israel would stop all fund transfers utilized by Hamas if it could, much like it would stop all arms shipment. In reality, that's impossible.

You may be comforted by the fact that 70$ million is chump change; the budget of the PA when it ruled Gaza was 500$ million+ if I recall correctly."

Cortez was an invader as was Columbus once he realized that the native populations were able to be exploited due to European technological superiority.

There were and have been quotas regarding immigration and for very pratical reasons once government had been established.

Power and profit have much more to do with what we're talking about than your suggested racism.

My granddad gifted me an old book on Nāstik Hinduism long back and I started changing my view of traditional Hinduism. 

Apparently, the gods you see in Hinduism were essentially symbols used by scholars of old to convey an abstract concept to the ignorant masses, and it is written that over time, the stories began to be taken too literally. The two Hindu epics, the Ramayana, and the longest poem in the world, Mahabharata, were just that, works of literature, and as time passed, these thousand year old stories, partly based on fact, began to be taken literally by the masses and it had deviated from its original meaning.

Of course you might bring up the caste system, and many defensive Hindus might see it as a social construct. It is mentioned in the Vedas, however, it is part of the most recent addition to the Vedas, and isn't exclusive to Hinduism. It has existed in Persian, Japanese, European and several other cultures.

Sadly as we are all aware the accusations levied at Iraq at the time that it was in material breach of that resolution (specifically with regard to WMD) and indeed the failure of the US and UK to gain agreement that Iraq was indeed in breach (the security council was divided...) would suggest that enforcement action was not required. Indeed the US and its allies currently claim that their action was on a humanitarian basis and intended to address Iraq's internal issues (specifically Saddam's rather brutal regime) rather than in response to a failure on the part of Iraq to meet its obligations.

Lets not pretend that Iraq had or was producing WMD's at the time when it was claimed by the US (Iraq undoubtedly had WMD previously and has used them in the past, weapons that were both of domestic origin and weapons sourced from its western allies to be used against Iran) or that the war in Iraq was justifiable on the basis of UN resolutions or as a defensive move.  Of course Israel's violations of existing UN resolutions are really of no concern either, they don't really address the current crisis, not to mention that the process the UN security council would need to go through to sanction Israel (or indeed Palestine) is not likely to fail due to veto's by permanent members on behalf of the combatants.

The UN should arrive at a new resolution that ensures that both the Palestinians and Israelis no longer face a threat from each others military and militants.  Such a resolution should make it possible for the international community to safeguard both Palestine and Israel and prevent the suffering that is ongoing due to the cycle of reprisal and revenge attacks that are now commonplace.  

Realistically Israel is in breach of its obligations under international law (in the way it is using its military now and in the way it has been treating the Palestinians) and Hamas and Fatah (And any number of other militant groups) have clearly been attacking civilian targets and acting in an illegitimate manner.  Neither side seems to want to ceasefire and actually pursue peace, so it seems logical that, if possible, the international community (such as it is) should impose a peace on both parties, using force if appropriate.

As a final note I will add that the last part of the above statement is clearly a pipe dream.  There does not exist a will to interfere in the region in a manner not sanctioned by the US, any action by (for the sake of argument) the EU, Russia or China would be resisted by all sides and condemned by the US, as such it is (regardless of how popular it would be with their own populations) extremely unlikely."

1. I didn't compare them, I used a reductio argument to refute your suggestion that popular support is an indication of a just cause.

That's why some engineers really don't know what to think of relativity, quantum mechanics or any of the more recent attempts to describe what happens where the concepts/tools they are used to, don't work. At least if they don't have to use these concepts. For example most civil engineers I know ( I don't know many, I admit) already ""know"" that string theory is wrong, because atoms are little dots and not strings, just like 50 years ago they knew gravity doesn't bend space, because a heavy piece of metal doesn't bend space either.

What you say about religion is at least not the modern European (Catholic or Protestant) Christian understanding of the bible. If you don't understand the bible literally but as metaphors, it isn't a holy text God literally gave them. And the sole purpose of religion is to help people deal with (usually emotional and somewhat personal) problems.


We can't know *anything* for sure! But if we have to choose from two ""metaphors"", choosing the totally unfounded one that is contradicted by tons of evidence (like Creationism) over a scientific (like Evolution) one, that explains best what we know, is really dumb.

Again: you can never find the ""right"" scientific theory, because it's impossible if there isn't something left that contradicts it. You can only see when it's false, and use this information to find a better one. Theories that you can't test (i.e. falsify) are worthless because they don't tell you *anything* applicable - any application is a test.

One day we will probably have a theory that unifies the *known* micro and macro theories, and for all intents and purposes we - and the engineers - can just assume that the world *literally* consists of vibrating 37-dimensional operator-valued membranes, but only until we find a something that isn't explained that way."

What you don't notice is that your neighboring Arab countries are not democracies. Their governments maybe either bought by the Americans or they try to object against Iran's influence, but their citizens for sure don't like what is happening in Israel.

The problem with Israels nuclear weapons is that nobody knows how well they work or will they work at all. The thing with nuclear weapons is they when they get older they start to decay and if Israel hasn't gotten info either from US or from France about what happens to those weapons in time, Israels nuclear weapons are a card unknown. You also don't count in that as the Arab countries develop they will get better technology and better defensive capabilities including working air and missile defense and when they get that then Israel nuclear weapons are more or less useless.

Israel is living in borrowed time because its a tiny country with 7 million people while its surrounded by hundred million more or less unfriendly Arabs. That is not a formula for success.

First, many economists consider a pure market as a non-zero-sum game. Therefore, you would need to conclude, following your own logic, that selfishness is good because ""it benefits the group and is entirely rational in non-zero-sum scenarios.""

Consequently, selfish and altruistic behaviours are both ""good"". So what's the point discussing this?

Second, there's a third option between (pure) altruistic and (pure) selfish behaviour, namley what I'd like to call ""selfish altruistic"" behaviour.

The third option is typically used in theoretical biology to explain why ants, for example, appear to be altruistic from an evolutionarly point of view: they do so because genes that favour altruistic behaviour favour themselves by improving the likelihood of survival of the queen which is a close relative to any ant.

In short, selfish altrustic behaviour may described as ""Other person wins, therefore you win, too.""

In fact, you used this explanantion yourself when you speculated that your friend - when saved from the bear -- is likely to reprociate the favour. This is like saying: ""It makes sense to attack the bear and save my friend, for he might do the same thing for me, too, one day."" This is not pure altruistic behaviour, this is selfish altruistic behaviour.

Third -- and most important --, your argument falls short because you argue from the ""group's point of view"". Strictly speaking, any ""group"" is an abstract concept that has no will, no emotions, and no rationality. In other words: A group is not a person, so why should anybody act as if it were?

You said: from the group's perspective, it doesn't matter who dies. But the group has no interest, whatsoever. It can't make judgments. It can't act. In summery, it only exists in our imagination. So why should anybody care about the group's perspective? It's just a metaphor!

Therefore, all arguments that claim rationality from a group's point of view fail: To act rational, you need to have preferences (wishes, needs). But what are the preferences of a metaphor? It has none, therefore it can't act rational.

Of course, peope will be quick to assume arbitraily preferences for the group. But usually it's just their own preferences, hidden in the rhetoric. For example, you stated the ""group"" is indifferent who dies. But what makes you think so? You also said, the group prefers that both live and none dies. But what makes you think so? The group is a metaphor, therefore we could also assume it prefers everybody to die and none to live. It's just as likely.

You may say that the preference of the group is simply an aggregation of the member's preferences. Unfortunatly, it can be shown that just three members may have preferences that cannot be simply aggregated, see  [Arrow's Impossibility Theorem](http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/arrow.htm).

So: All I can take care of is my interest, my judgements, and my actions. Therefore, I'll run when a bear attacks. And I have no problem with my friend trying to run as fast as he can, too.

For maybe, we both are fast enought to out-run the bear. In fact, it's more likely to survive by out-running a bear -- humans are made to run -- than by attacking him. This way, my and my friends individual selfish actions may result in -- what you called -- a ""HUGE social benefit"": we both survive.

For these reasons I don't agree with your conclusion: Selfishness may also be rational in the long run.

Additionally, you failed to prove that pure altruistic behaviour is ""rational"", at all."

There is, let us say, a certain filthy rookery in Hoxton, dripping with disease and honeycombed with crime and promiscuity. There are, let us say, two noble and courageous young men, of pure intentions and (if you prefer it) noble birth; let us call them Hudge and Gudge. Hudge, let us say, is of a bustling sort; he points out that the people must at all costs be got out of this den; he subscribes and collects money, but he finds (despite the large financial interests of the Hudges) that the thing will have to be done on the cheap if it is to be done on the spot. He therefore, runs up a row of tall bare tenements like beehives; and soon has all the poor people bundled into their little brick cells, which are certainly better than their old quarters, in so far as they are weather proof, well ventilated and supplied with clean water. But Gudge has a more delicate nature. He feels a nameless something lacking in the little brick boxes; he raises numberless objections; he even assails the celebrated Hudge Report, with the Gudge Minority Report; and by the end of a year or so has come to telling Hudge heatedly that the people were much happier where they were before. As the people preserve in both places precisely the same air of dazed amiability, it is very difficult to find out which is right. But at least one might safely say that no people ever liked stench or starvation as such, but only some peculiar pleasures en tangled with them. Not so feels the sensitive Gudge. Long before the final quarrel (Hudge v. Gudge and Another), Gudge has succeeded in persuading himself that slums and stinks are really very nice things; that the habit of sleeping fourteen in a room is what has made our England great; and that the smell of open drains is absolutely essential to the rearing of a viking breed.

But, meanwhile, has there been no degeneration in Hudge? Alas, I fear there has. Those maniacally ugly buildings which he originally put up as unpretentious sheds barely to shelter human life, grow every day more and more lovely to his deluded eye. Things he would never have dreamed of defending, except as crude necessities, things like common kitchens or infamous asbestos stoves, begin to shine quite sacredly before him, merely because they reflect the wrath of Gudge. He maintains, with the aid of eager little books by Socialists, that man is really happier in a hive than in a house. The practical difficulty of keeping total strangers out of your bedroom he describes as Brotherhood; and the necessity for climbing twenty-three flights of cold stone stairs, I dare say he calls Effort. The net result of their philanthropic adventure is this: that one has come to defending indefensible slums and still more indefensible slum-landlords, while the other has come to treating as divine the sheds and pipes which he only meant as desperate. Gudge is now a corrupt and apoplectic old Tory in the Carlton Club; if you mention poverty to him he roars at you in a thick, hoarse voice something that is conjectured to be ""Do 'em good!"" Nor is Hudge more happy; for he is a lean vegetarian with a gray, pointed beard and an unnaturally easy smile, who goes about telling everybody that at last we shall all sleep in one universal bedroom; and he lives in a Garden City, like one forgotten of God.

Such is the lamentable history of Hudge and Gudge; which I merely introduce as a type of an endless and exasperating misunderstanding which is always occurring in modern England. To get men out of a rookery men are put into a tenement; and at the beginning the healthy human soul loathes them both. A man's first desire is to get away as far as possible from the rookery, even should his mad course lead him to a model dwelling. The second desire is, naturally, to get away from the model dwelling, even if it should lead a man back to the rookery. But I am neither a Hudgian nor a Gudgian; and I think the mistakes of these two famous and fascinating persons arose from one simple fact. They arose from the fact that neither Hudge nor Gudge had ever thought for an instant what sort of house a man might probably like for himself. In short, they did not begin with the ideal; and, therefore, were not practical politicians.

We may now return to the purpose of our awkward parenthesis about the praise of the future and the failures of the past. A house of his own being the obvious ideal for every man, we may now ask (taking this need as typical of all such needs) why he hasn't got it; and whether it is in any philosophical sense his own fault. Now, I think that in some philosophical sense it is his own fault, I think in a yet more philosophical sense it is the fault of his philosophy. And this is what I have now to attempt to explain.

Burke, a fine rhetorician, who rarely faced realities, said, I think, that an Englishman's house is his castle. This is honestly entertaining; for as it happens the Englishman is almost the only man in Europe whose house is not his castle. Nearly everywhere else exists the assumption of peasant proprietorship; that a poor man may be a landlord, though he is only lord of his own land. Making the landlord and the tenant the same person has certain trivial advantages, as that the tenant pays no rent, while the landlord does a little work. But I am not concerned with the defense of small proprietorship, but merely with the fact that it exists almost everywhere except in England. It is also true, however, that this estate of small possession is attacked everywhere today; it has never existed among ourselves, and it may be destroyed among our neighbors. We have, therefore, to ask ourselves what it is in human affairs generally, and in this domestic ideal in particular, that has really ruined the natural human creation, especially in this country.

Man has always lost his way. He has been a tramp ever since Eden; but he always knew, or thought he knew, what he was looking for. Every man has a house somewhere in the elaborate cosmos; his house waits for him waist deep in slow Norfolk rivers or sunning itself upon Sussex downs. Man has always been looking for that home which is the subject matter of this book. But in the bleak and blinding hail of skepticism to which he has been now so long subjected, he has begun for the first time to be chilled, not merely in his hopes, but in his desires. For the first time in history he begins really to doubt the object of his wanderings on the earth. He has always lost his way; but now he has lost his address.

Under the pressure of certain upper-class philosophies (or in other words, under the pressure of Hudge and Gudge) the average man has really become bewildered about the goal of his efforts; and his efforts, therefore, grow feebler and feebler. His simple notion of having a home of his own is derided as bourgeois, as sentimental, or as despicably Christian. Under various verbal forms he is recommended to go on to the streets—which is called Individualism; or to the work-house—which is called Collectivism. We shall consider this process somewhat more carefully in a moment. But it may be said here that Hudge and Gudge, or the governing class generally, will never fail for lack of some modern phrase to cover their ancient predominance. The great lords will refuse the English peasant his three acres and a cow on advanced grounds, if they cannot refuse it longer on reactionary grounds. They will deny him the three acres on grounds of State Ownership. They will forbid him the cow on grounds of humanitarianism.

And this brings us to the ultimate analysis of this singular influence that has prevented doctrinal demands by the English people. There are, I believe, some who still deny that England is governed by an oligarchy. It is quite enough for me to know that a man might have gone to sleep some thirty years ago over the day's newspaper and woke up last week over the later newspaper, and fancied he was reading about the same people. In one paper he would have found a Lord Robert Cecil, a Mr. Gladstone, a Mr. Lyttleton, a Churchill, a Chamberlain, a Trevelyan, an Acland. In the other paper he would find a Lord Robert Cecil, a Mr. Gladstone, a Mr. Lyttleton, a Churchill, a Chamberlain, a Trevelyan, an Acland. If this is not being governed by families I cannot imagine what it is. I suppose it is being governed by extraordinary democratic coincidences.

Therefore, you would need to conclude, following your own logic, that selfishness is good because ""it benefits the group and is entirely rational in non-zero-sum scenarios.""

Eh? 

Zero sum scenarios are *""my gain comes at your lose""* situations. The total sum of utility cancels each other out and results in zero. A good example is the Prisoner's Dilemma.

Non zero sum scenarios are ""my lose is your lose, my gains are your gains"". The total sum of utility results in a positive or negative number (non-zero).

The optimal strategy in zero-sum scenarios is selfishness. Either my gain comes at your lose or your lose comes at my gain....which means I want to be selfish and gain for myself because the alternative is my lose. 

Conversely, the optimal strategy in non-zero-sum scenarios is co-operation. If I wish to gain, I must co-operate with you and we bother gain.

So I'm not sure we're on the same page here...

There is a difference between ""selfishness"" and ""self-interest"". All actions are self-interested in both scenarios but not all actions are selfish.

Selfishness is explicitly doing something that benefits you at the expense of other people.

Altruism is the opposite of Selfishness and is explicitly doing something that benefits others at the expense of yourself. 

Selfishness is blameworthy. Altruism is praiseworthy.

&gt; your argument falls short because you argue from the ""group's point of view"". Strictly speaking, any ""group"" is an abstract concept that has no will, no emotions, and no rationality. In other words: A group is not a person, so why should anybody act as if it were? You said: from the group's perspective, it doesn't matter who dies. But the group has no interest, whatsoever. It can't make judgments. It can't act. In summery, it only exists in our imagination. So why should anybody care about the group's perspective? It's just a metaphor!

Are you high? &lt;3

What about the country you live in? Is that not a ""group""? What about the laws that govern the country you belong to? Are they not representative of values of ""the group""? What about culture? What about politics and social dynamics? Sure, they are ""abstract concepts"" but they are very real abstract concepts which we as human beings have adopted and they describe ""the group"" and have causal implications.

Human beings are social creatures. We have been living in groups since the first instance of our species. It is incredibly fallacious to claim ""the group"" exists in **our** imagination and claim it has not real life implications.

If you want to argue epistemology and claim *""The only thing I know is that I exist""* then fine, you can be as selfish as you want and be entirely rational. I just warn you that you're going to be one delusional and lonely person.

I'm being cruel though and you've made some insightful comments.

1) Genes.

Altruism is typically explained and justified through the ""self-interests"" of our genes. I suppose we can accept that angle of analysis. It only strengthens my claim that Altruism is good because it is intrinsic to humanity.

However I still think selfishness is irrational. Selfishness is counter-intuitive to our collective mentalities and is an irrationally short-sight version of self-interest.

Selfishness is NOT self-interest (assuming we adopt Robert Wright's definition). 

I'm not sure what you're trying to say when you say you haven't read Ayn Rand or Robert Wright because you're European....Don't Europeans read books anymore? You don't need to read a book, just google the names and get a general gist of their theories...

I think you need to first accept a distinction between selfishness and self-interest. Ayn Rand is preaching selfishness. This is NOT THE SAME AS SELF INTEREST."

You asked why retaliation should be proportional and I answered because you should be not worse than your opponent if you want to justify your actions.

This is a military conflict. Just because it is playing out on civilian territory does not mean that the operation should be aborted. Justification of our actions is 8 years of rocket fire on Sderot; dozens of suicide bombings totalling hundreds of victims, kidnapping of our soldier, and many many more things Hamas and friends did in the past without any repercussion. If we limit the response to ""proportional"" Hamas can sustain war against Israel indefinitely. Is this an acceptable outcome to you? To us it is not. It is absurd to propose that Israel fights ""fair"" in the war that consists entirely of dirty tricks.

&gt; Israel has been treating Palestinians very poorly, to say the least. It is no wonder that they protest and it is no wonder that the protests escalate if Israel responds the way it does.

True, but why exactly are they exempt from the rules of initiation of aggression and military conflict? Because Ilan Pappe says so? I'm sorry, no one is going to sacrifice the citizens or national security because of a condemned conspiracy theory. Since when protesting equals fighting? If you attack someone, you accept the consequences of the fight, do you not? If you protest, the truth is on your side, is it not?

&gt; All I am saying is that Israel takes the wrong path in choosing military violence as a solution.

It is *not* a solution, or *the* solution. It is a military operation which is meant to nullify Hamas capacity to shoot rockets. Antizionists here will list you all the names for it: genocide, nazism, racism, massacre, rape, atrocity, whatever, but the fact remains that this has nothing to do with any of these things **any more than other military conflict**.

&gt; You might succeed in creating a temporal drop in actual violence towards Israel by harming the organization structure.

So the only solution is to surrender on whatever terms Hamas dictates, is that what you're saying? That because of our moral values, we should allow the enemy to dictate terms of the surrender because the enemy is using civilians to protect themselves? And if this works for Hamas this time, what if the next time they demand Tel Aviv be purged of jews? Are we going to turn over Tel Aviv? That's absurd.

&gt; I would like to avoid to make it an issue of Jews and to refer to the Holocaust

Yes, you are correct, Holocaust has nothing to do with this although, you must understand, for Jewish people it is impossible to remove it from their perspective. The people who suffered it are still alive and they still tell their tales.

My point was not this. I have very carefully examined nearly every reddit submission related to Israel since the war started. I see very clear patterns in the talking points, I see the same arguments and unfounded accusations that were used in every single case Israel went to war; but above all, I see that underneath most of this criticism of Israel is not a genuine intent to protect the gazans or help them, but a sinister coordinated attempt to villify Israel and peddle traditional conspiracy theories, which are oh so popular in the arab world. Electronic Intifada, Uruknet, Rense, WhatReallyHappened et al - all the arguments about Israel are emanating from there, and these are hate sites manned by racists, who do not mind at all lying and perverting the truth because, according to their reasoning, if jews didn't do something bad then they are about to so might as well make it up. The storm of anti-Israel submissions to reddit and other social sites serves one purpose: to make people think that it is a completely legitimate idea that Israel should be abolished, and that jews are evil people. This *is* antisemitism, it is acting through deception and distortion and it is racism in its purest form. It is something that scares and sickens me. 

&gt; And I even do not think that this is a sign of desperation but of planned bad intentions of the Hamas leadership.

It is, and there is no way to fight it other than by burning it out with fire. We have tried everything. We have arab countries lining up eager to open discussions between Hamas and Israel RIGHT NOW; but what does Hamas do? They hide in their holes and lie about how many IDF soldiers they killed.

&gt; The thing is that you have to offer an alternative to the people who have brought Hamas to power.

The alternative has been offered to them. Many times. This time, it was offered to them that they cease firing rockets and IDF withdraws. But no, said Hamas, what do we care about the people whom we make targets? We're more interested in more martyrdom for the great cause of liberation of Palestine. Then, they went into hiding and left the population around their rocket piles to be bodies.

My personal genuine wish is complete cessation of hostilities and independent state for the arabs, but this simply can not happen as long as there are unaccountable terrorist groups running the show. You give them a finger and they gnaw off your head, and then proceed to urinate on your dead body.

&gt; Israel has the power to end the violence.

True. Sometimes it is so obvious to me that I feel I should say fuck it and start my own peace movement. But this can not be in the form of a sudden onset of pacifism in the middle of mass attacks on Israeli citizens. Arabs have committed no less cruel atrocities against us; why is it that on their side there is not a single voice of radical pacifism like there is in Israel, Europe, USA and even on reddit?

Edit: not my downmods.

Our company makes money on volatility, so if the market is dropping or popping a lot, we make money either way.

I think it's the media trying to ""connect"" with the ""average investor"".  the ""average investor"" is ussually under the ""buy and hold"" dogma and don't really short sell or anything like that.  So for the average joe, he's 401K is going to be shitty in a down market and good in a up market.  So, I think they are catering to that.


2.  I'm not an expert, but from what I understand: 

A)  A lot of it is political.  Big firms had to 'pay' for a seat (so they could get on the floor and trade).  So they bought a ton of seats in the 80s or 90s and then when the tech caught up, these big firms didn't want to lose their ""investment"" on those seats.  

Since they are big customers, they can influence the exchange to an extent.  If all your big customers have bought seats and want to keep those seats, it would be bad business to move everything electronic at once and fuck over your best/biggest customers.  So they do this half assed attempt that doesn't work to well, but pacifies the big companies that paid a lot of money for those seats.



B) for odd lots and big trades, people want to talk to a real person (to work a deal, to spread out the execution, etc) and not just cram a 250,000 quantity buy order into their electronic terminal.

There is probably a few others reasons also.  A lot of it has to do with ""history"".  Legacy crap that is hard to get rid of.  I think anyone that works in IT has been involved in a system like that before.  The market systems are huge though, so no one really wants to do a complete overhaul [i guess].

There are a few 100% electronic exchanges.  The biggest I know of [USA at least], is ISE - it's an option exchange.

I also believe that there are some Europe and Asia systems are 100% electronic.

You know who's responsible for this? Everyone. Hamas, Israel, the incompetent PA, Egypt, the UN, Europe and the US. Everyone has failed to do their part to protect their own people and take productive steps toward a resolution.

Before you criticize the actions of one or hail those of another ask yourself, ""Will this get us closer to a solution?""

I am against the actions of both Israel and Hamas. Both sides have demonstrated nothing but contempt for the lives of their own people and their enemies.

Hamas is simply the sad byproduct of the failures of the last twenty years by both Israeli and Palestinian leaders. The incompetence and corruption of Fatah, Israel's unwillingness to give even an inch when it comes to settlements, closure, and occupation. The total lack of commitment to achieving peace. Now you have Hamas, which is counterproductive to both Israeli and Palestinian security and any hopes each have for living in peaceful states of their own.

Will rocketry get the Palestinians a state? Not in the next century. Will Israel killing another 500+ Palestinians and reoccupying the Strip insure their security. No. And the PA? If you think Bush is a lame duck, look at Abbas. He makes Bush look like the very definition of competent, solid leadership.

Fuck it, really. The Israelis want peace and settlements. The Palestinians want peace and total return of refugees. You can keep saying both sides want peace, but the peace they seek is totally different and there's little if any real, compromising dialogue within the forces of civil society in the region. People will continue to die indiscriminately because of the lack of political courage on either side.

[Hate speech](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Hate_speech) is banned in the UK and many other European countries.  IIRC, in the UK in defamation cases, there is a presumption of guilt, rather than innocence, as in the United States.  [Blasphemy law](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Blasphemy_law_in_the_United_Kingdom) is now historical, but it was still rather unpleasant.

Going down [Wikipedia](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Censorship_in_the_United_Kingdom), there are some things that I've heard of before, and some I haven't:

The UK definition of obscenity is rather wider than the US, and includes anything that has a ""tendency to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences, and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall"".

The UK [Terrorism Act 2006](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Terrorism_Act_2006) makes it illegal to glorify terrorism.  This sort of thing might have been severely looked down upon in the US after 9/11, but the federal government would not ban it.  Even if speech is *very* unpopular, there's a high bar to protecting it.

The US has never attempted to ban videogames, even highly objectionable ones (WP lists Carmageddon as one that was blocked in the UK and only later allowed).  There have been (failed) attempts to create US federal regulation schemes, but not to outright ban.

The UK has had [recent attempts to censor Internet content at the ISP level](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_United_Kingdom) (which recently created problems for Wikipedia).  Australia has seen similar attempts.  In the US, such attempts  get shot down pretty early.

On the other hand, it's not all one-way; for example, US broadcast law (only applying to old analog unencrypted signals, which you can't really choose to skip when 
flipping through channels) prevents toplessness on TV.  The US federal government has banned [domestic support of foreign-originated boycotts of Israel](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Censorship_in_the_United_States#Ban_on_material_support_for_foreign_boycotts) (I wasn't aware of this, either).

Lots of people in America actually believe that Jews are ""the chosen people"", something that no one believes in Europe and to us, this sort of belief seems like a very fanatical subtext to the whole situation there.

Ultimately, the situation was difficult to begin with. Israel was not created under peaceful terms. In fact, it was created by rather ruthlessly taking over land and fighting with their neighbors to expand their land, which ultimately set the stage for this gorilla war that is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict we see today: kinda like a shotgun wedding. There is still a deep wound in Palestinians and loathing from the surounding Arab states that is fueling this whole thing and Israel's refusal to acknowledge this is what keeps it going. 

Ultimately, the deed is done and the key to a solution is for Israel to accept and stop their refusal of having Hamas at the negotiating table. Hamas isn't just going to disappear because Israel wishes it to. They are going to have to face their enemies and come to a solution. Problems don't fix themselves and war is only going to add strength to Hamas.

Yes, Israel had every moral - and legal right - to go there.

Yes. There were. And there was enough room for everyone, but then arabs rioted and violence started. Jews have every right for a state in Palestine and so do arabs.

&gt; they should have taken a piece of Europe like part of Germany or something

Jewish life, culture, tradition and religion has always been centered around Palestine. Jews were in exile from Palestine; but they have begun returning to it since 11th century. I do not see why this should require anyone's approval; even more so on a land that legally does not belong to people who live on it.

Arabs were offered a partition plan and rejected it. They launched a war and lost.

A car is not a source of energy. As a matter of fact most people (in EUrope, anyway) buy efficient and/or affordable cars.

ROI situation certainly looks different for off-grid applications.

We have a single Honda Jazz. A second car would be beyond our means, and not strictly needed, given good public transport (this is Germany).

Good stuff, I just use my mountain bike for commute during the warmer part of the year. I'll go low-voltage when PV panel is there, in another 5-8 years.

&gt; Sometimes this stuff is practical and EROI etc become meaningless.

An energy source with a negative EROI is not an energy source. It might still be worthwhile due to positive ROI, but that's economics, not thermodynamics.

Of course genetics play a role in those things, that's a given, genetics plays a role in *everything* we do and are, but it tells us nothing about a person's dietary habits.

America's obesity problem (I assume that you acknowledge that the US has one), and any other nation's obesity problem, is *not* down to genetics. Neither is it down to the ""prejudices"" of ""bigots"" redefining what body type, weight or mass is healthy. America's obesity problem is down to what Americans eat and how much of it they eat.

If obesity were principally down to genetics, then Europeans would be suffering from it too, but they are not, at least, not to anything like the same degree (although the UK is doing its best to follow the US example). The Germans eat very heartily, but they have nothing like the obesity problem that the US has, the French famously love their food and drink, but you don't see many Vito Spatafores or Bobby ""Bacala"" Baccalieris in Paris (or elsewhere in the country). Ditto the Scandanavians. 

None of this is bigotry or prejudice. The US has developed a particular nutritional culture, that culture has produced the results we see today. Getting angry with others for pointing out the obvious, claiming that existing standards need to be overhauled because so many US citizens now fall foul of them isn't going to cut much ice outside of the US, and it's clear that it doesn't cut much ice with a large swathe of the US population. 

Your claim that genetics is behind the obesity problems in the US is palpably wrong, and like many, I suspect that much of that thinking at least, is propagated by the food industry itself, attempting to justify its role in the poisoning and partial disablement of many millions of US citizens.

Is it because they have elected a government which is actually responsible to the will of the people.

There are a number of causes/items of note.

* Satisfaction with a lower productivity.

* Lack of ethnic and cultural diversity leads to simplified bureaucratic burden.

* Similarly, bureaucratic burden increases with the size and distribution of the population.

* Socialism has been implemented ""with a braod stroke"" twice.  In China and in Russia.  Russia's economy exsanguinated itself. China has switched to a fascist economic model.

* Europe, on the other hand, is comprised of several ethnographically insular, geographically miniscule nations -- none of which are also required to carry the burden of their own militarized defense (the entirety of Europe has been ""riding on the coat-tails"" of the Pax Americana, for good or ill.)  Despite this, Germany and France are set -- for varying reasons -- to face the imminent collapse of their economies.  

* Europe in general is handling the economic collapse **vastly** less readily than is America.

&gt; Are other countries filled with better, more educated people?

There are more highly educated individuals with American college doctorates than any other nation's.  That being said, we also tend to have a higher problem with semi- and pseudo- literacy than just about any other modernized nation.  This despite a reliably higher per-capita spending pattern than most other nations.  Education isn't the problem -- it's part of the symptom.

&gt; Or do they just have better regulations and rules governing their democracy?

I will freely concede that the Parliamentary system is likely better than the Presidential.  At the very least, it discourages the ""Winner-Take-All"" system we're stuck with.

TL;DR version:

Socialism ***isn't*** working well for other countries.  It only *appears* to do so as a result of America crippling itself to a lesser extent with fascist economic practices."

Obviously people don't learn from history, every single colonised country used to be considered terrorist.

Palestinians Hamas or not Hamas are fighting against the invader, and don't give me that bullshit ""Palestine was never a country"", so what if officially they weren't? does that mean you have the right to come along and oppress the natives (for more than 2000 years), killing them just for the fuck of it, and force them to leave their lands?

Call them terrorists all you want, but technically they aren't and every zionist soul knows it deep down...

If someone came to my homeland, started shooting my brothers, my comrades, i will not hesitate to fight back...

Anyone who thinks Israel wants peace is delusional, they never did, proof is they've been an outlaw since 60 years already, never respected a U.N resolution, never respected a E.U resolution, they've been hiding under the US shadow for always, if they really want peace, why not respect the Palestinian people? why not take off the settlements in the West Bank? why not take off the checkpoints?

Will you not fight if you were invaded and oppressed, treated as a sub-human?

Israel provoked the rise of extremism in Gaza (starving them made Hamas even more pppular, they aknowledged this but did nothing), 60 years and Peace talks didn't progress, nothing changed for Palestinians, except few settlers removed just to give the impression that there's progress, Israel succeded not in Peace, just in propaganda, that they did achieve perfectly

and the only argument zionists use is ""what would do another country if they were attacked?"" to that i say Israel is still occupying Palestine which doesn't make them a country yet but an occupying force.

The sad thing is to see how Israel is lying to the world, saying that there's no humanitarian crisis, a spokesmen of the governement even said that there's extra food and they don't know anymore where to put it!!! Another one on the swiss channel said the world is doing nothing to help Palestinians except Israel ( lol how can they help Gaza if there is a blockade?!?!)
While all the international organisations, the U.N and the international food program are saying that the situation is a disaster.
Now who should we trust? our eyes? or Livni's speech?

The bbc went to a hospital today, asked the foreign doctors allowed to Gaza (2 max 3) if there are enough medical supplies, the doctor said ""it's a stupid statement"" pointing to all the people waiting in line for a surgery.

Not true. Between 1920 and 1939, 3.3 million Jews left Europe. The majority of them (over 2 million) chose to go to the US. Only around 400,000 went to Palestine. Back then (just like now), the economic situation in Palestine was very bad compared to the US, and only the die hard zionists were willing to make this choice.

It might seem ironic, but had it not been for Hitler, the zionists wouldn't have had the ability to increase their numbers in Palestine to a high enough level to achieve ""independence"".

Don't fool yourself with the nonsense Israeli propaganda of overwhelming force.   Overwhelming force is when you  bring so much force that either your opponent is not able to react, or if he does resist then there is small localize damage.  This is what happens when Police decides to arrest a difficult person.  They bring lot of officers to over power the subject,  that is not exactly the same as beating you to a  pulp each time they pull you over.  

Israel is bringing in overwhelming destruction, hoping for the shock and awe that many idiots before them tried.   For a historical parallel..... If you can see any difference between what is happening in Gaza today and what happened in these pictures, I like to know.

&gt; Jews were barred from the Western Wall at least part of the time Jordan had control.

The best you can come up with is that in some period in history Jews were not allowed to go to this wall?

For your information, prior to World War I there was no Jordan.  Jordan, like Israel is a legacy of British and French colonialism in middle east.    British recognized the importance of Middle East they applied divide and conquer tactic.   

Furhtermore, Do you realize that for most part Mosque is off limit to Palestinians?   

What is worst is that Palestinians can't even  go from village to a village, or even go to sea to catch a fish, people die in Isreali check points on the way to  hospitals.... There is not even basic daily life without constant harassments from Israeli army, or the Zionist terrorist (aka settlers).     It seems that the only connection Palestinians have to the Mosque is a picture they hand from their rooms.

Did Jews ever lived in the middle east like how Zionist have forced the Palestinians to  live?


&gt; I think you are blinded either by ideology, or bigotry.

You are right, I am bigot toward all form of hateful ideology.   


&gt; by not calling for the immediate destruction of the state of Israel, I must therefore don't think it's that big of a deal.

&gt; But it saddens me that your absolutes are so rigid, 

I think any one with any sense of humanity should call and end to the ideology that is governing Israel.  Is that rigid?    As you said , in my opinion, Israel's action is on par with Nazis,  I would expect every Jewish person to applaud my rigidity in that there are people like myself (many of them indeed are Jewish)  that wont just look the other way.     Didn't WW II teach us that we should not be silent?    People died in the concentration camps because most people were not rigid.  Too many people were looking for ""shades of meaning""  while atrocities were being committed.  

""Destruction of state of Israel"" slogan is nonsense statement, made to make appeal to emotions.  Both side use it to appeal to their radicals.


&gt; they prejudice your view of any counter argument to your own understanding.

Views and Understanding is how we choose to interpret the history, in the final analysis we can believe whatever we went.  The question is what is the future.  


Clearly this land is precious to many groups.  Nationalism really doesn't make sense in the holy land.   I can also understand that after experience of WW II Jews would immigrate from Europe.     

My hope is to see the ""holly land"" as a  de-militarize zone with one man-one vote regardless  of your religion or ethnicity.    I want to see day that if you can produce a title to the land, then you are entitle to all the rights that the title granted you.  Your religion doesn't determine your citizenship.    If any one can't live with that, then they should not be entitled to live there.    To live in the holly land you need to accept certain principals, anyone regardless of their religion or ethnicity that can't live with them should be removed.  

Israel should be center of reconciliation and peaceful future.  Zionist have clearly shown that they are not capable of delivering even a two state solution. They need to be removed before the whole humanity is destroyed.   "

Still more Holocaust denial. Sorry, but the death camps were set up for the specific purpose to kill civilians, not an act of war. The big death in Gaza is the 400 over the last few days, the Germans did more than that every single day. To people who were not fighting back, who were not combatants at all. You can try all you like to deny that the Holocaust was a bad thing, but it won't work.

Israel founded on terrorism? Israel wasn't funded on terrorism. Sure, blood has been spilled on both sides, but the Jews that came here did not come with the intentions of building an army and driving out all the arabs. You can see that by the fact that THEY DID NOT ENGAGE IN VIOLENT BEHAVIOUR UNTIL PROVOKED BY NUMERIOUS PALESTINIAN ATTACKS.

One more thing, tell me of a country that did not have violence in its past. The US? Great Britain? France? Germany? All of whom were part of some pretty big atrocities. The history of Europe is one of constant battles and massacres, where lands were constantly conquered and reconquered. I'd say that Israel's history compared to these other ""great"" countries is pretty mild.

Both sides are not completely serious about peace in the region, but the Palestinian leadership is to be blamed for this, they keep fucking up all the time. Using the opportunity of open borders for smuggling weapons instead of letting humanitarian aid come through, buying arms instead of investing in the people and not giving a shit about cease fires.

Look at it from Israel's point of view. Should it bend over backwards and kiss the ass of the other side knowing that they're weaker, even though that they keep doing whatever they want, just for peace? Politics doesn't work that way.

Khalid Mish'al is the head of the Hamas political bureau:

For 18 months my people in Gaza have been under siege, incarcerated inside the world's biggest prison, sealed off from land, air and sea, caged and starved, denied even medication for our sick. After the slow death policy came the bombardment. In this most densely populated of places, nothing has been spared Israel's warplanes, from government buildings to homes, mosques, hospitals, schools and markets. More than 540 have been killed and thousands permanently maimed. A third are women and children. Whole families have been massacred, some while they slept.

This river of blood is being shed under lies and false pretexts. For six months we in Hamas observed the ceasefire. Israel broke it repeatedly from the start. Israel was required to open crossings to Gaza, and extend the truce to the West Bank. It proceeded to tighten its deadly siege of Gaza, repeatedly cutting electricity and water supplies. The collective punishment did not halt, but accelerated - as did the assassinations and killings. Thirty Gazans were killed by Israeli fire and hundreds of patients died as a direct effect of the siege during the so-called ceasefire. Israel enjoyed a period of calm. Our people did not.

When this broken truce neared its end, we expressed our readiness for a new comprehensive truce in return for lifting the blockade and opening all Gaza border crossings, including Rafah. Our calls fell on deaf ears. Yet still we would be willing to begin a new truce on these terms following the complete withdrawal of the invading forces from Gaza.

No rockets have ever been fired from the West Bank. But 50 died and hundreds more were injured there last year at Israel's hands, while its expansionism proceeded relentlessly. We are meant to be content with shrinking scraps of territory, a handful of cantons at Israel's mercy, enclosed by it from all sides.The truth is Israel seeks a one-sided ceasefire, observed by my people alone, in return for siege, starvation, bombardment, assassinations, incursions and colonial settlement. What Israel wants is a gratuitous ceasefire.

The logic of those who demand that we stop our resistance is absurd. They absolve the aggressor and occupier - armed with the deadliest weapons of death and destruction - of responsibility, while blaming the victim, prisoner and occupied. Our modest, home-made rockets are our cry of protest to the world. Israel and its American and European sponsors want us to be killed in silence. But die in silence we will not.

What is being visited on Gaza today was visited on Yasser Arafat before. When he refused to bow to Israel's dictates, he was imprisoned in his Ramallah headquarters, surrounded by tanks for two years. When this failed to break his resolve, he was murdered by poisoning.

Gaza enters 2009 just as it did 2008: under Israeli fire. Between January and February of last year 140 Gazans died in air strikes. And just before it embarked on its failed military assault on Lebanon in July 2006, Israel rained thousands of shells on Gaza, killing 240. From Deir Yassin in 1948 to Gaza today, the list of Israel's crimes is long. The justifications change, but the reality is the same: colonial occupation, oppression, and never-ending injustice. If this is the ""free world"" whose ""values"" Israel is defending, as its foreign minister Tzipi Livni alleges, then we want nothing to do with it.

Israel's leaders remain in the grip of confusion, unable to set clear goals for the attacks - from ousting the legitimately elected Hamas government and destroying its infrastructure, to stopping the rockets. As they fail to break Gaza's resistance the benchmark has been lowered. Now they speak of weakening Hamas and limiting the resistance. But they will achieve neither. Gaza's people are more united than ever, determined not to be terrorised into submission. Our fighters, armed with the justice of their cause, have already caused many casualties among the occupation army and will fight on to defend their land and people. Nothing can defeat our will to be free.

Once again, Washington and Europe have opted to aid and abet the jailer, occupier and aggressor, and to condemn its victims. We hoped Barack Obama would break with George Bush's disastrous legacy but his start is not encouraging. While he swiftly moved to denounce the Mumbai attacks, he remains tongue-tied after 10 days of slaughter in Gaza. But my people are not alone. Millions of freedom-loving men and women stand by its struggle for justice and liberation - witness daily protests against Israeli aggression, not only in the Arab and Islamic region, but worldwide.

Israel will no doubt wreak untold destruction, death and suffering in Gaza. But it will meet the same fate in Gaza as it did in Lebanon. We will not be broken by siege and bombardment, and will never surrender to occupation.

That was Dec 30th.  It's been paid.

&gt;I'm certain the fines for late payments were on the contract they signed. 

Untrue, the fines are based on a contractual even which has not occurred - Ukraine owes no fines.

&gt;It can be reduced to a difference of outlook: Do you expect oil prices to rise to $60 a barrel this year, or to drop back down to between $30 and $40 a barrel? (Oil has surged in the last two trading days to about $46 a barrel because of the fighting in Gaza.)

&gt;In Europe, natural gas prices follow oil, and Russia is clearly of the consensus view that oil will average somewhere in the neighborhood of $60 a barrel this year. That corresponds to a natural gas price of about $350 per 1,000 cubic meters. (Here’s the loose formula to get the natural gas price: divide the oil price by six, then multiply the result by 35.3).

&gt;Hence the claim by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin that the demand by Gazprom, Russia’s natural gas behemoth, for $250 per 1,000 cubic meters from Ukraine this year amounts to a “humanitarian gesture.”

&gt;Ukraine, however, has embraced oil’s most recent price band. It’s arguing that oil will average $40 a barrel this year, or $235 per 1,000 cubic meters of natural gas. That’s precisely what Ukraine has counter-offered to Gazprom.

&gt;(As a separate matter, if Europe truly is paying $500 per 1,000 cubic meters, as Gazprom has claimed, it is seriously overpaying. That corresponds to $84-a-barrel oil.)

&gt;(Another baffling issue is Russia’s claim that it’s owed a $600 million late fee on top of the $1.5 billion natural gas bill that Ukraine already has paid. That’s a 40% penalty, and Ukraine is only a month late.)

&gt;The subtext is the nature of the two countries’ contract, which is based not on the spot price of natural gas, or a forecast, but a formula that lags current prices by eight months. In other words, when Gazprom is retorting that it in fact could charge Ukraine $418 per 1,000 cubic meters if it so wishes, that’s Russia’s estimate of the price of natural gas last May.

Unless you are a Russian agent, you know this is political payback for Ukraine daring to talk back to Russia this past summer over the Georgia war.

Don't be naive here - Russia isn't the good guy in this.

EDIT: Also, nymex spot gas is $215 per 1000cm, so please do tell me why Russia feels $400 is the 'market price'.

*""It is dangerous for a Jew to say that he would rather go to some other country, not Palestine. Such dissenters have been severely beaten, and worse. Not long ago, in Palestine, nearly 1,000 Austrian Jews informed the international refugee organisation that they would like to go back to Austria, and plans were made to repatriate them.

Should the Palestinians simply give up on their dreams for freedom because they're not convenient for Israel? And don't tell me it's because of Palestinian violence, because I know you're familiar enough with the situation to realize that the Palestinians did not resort to violence in any major way in the early years of Occupation.

I think these approaches make sense:
*Professor Bernard Avashai at TPM Cafe:*
&gt;The point is, the rise of Hamas is a cautionary tale about trying to do quickly with military force what needs to be done over a generation with reciprocity. All along, Israel might have made a strong statement of a different kind. It might have endorsed the obvious features a two-state solution, like the ones worked out with President Clinton just before he left office in 2001. It might have helped strengthen the Palestinians' immunity to Hamas ideology, creating a stronger civil society, new businesses, new schools, new Palestinian cooperation with international peace-keepers and investors.

&gt;Israel might have meanwhile announced, say, that it can know the precise location from which each Hamas missile is launched, and that it would bomb that location exactly ten minutes after each launch, giving surrounding citizens a chance to flee--and creating a mounting incentive for civilians to resist Hamas cadres using their homes as cover. One can think of any number of creative ideas that project strength, decency, and hope. This is not, well, rocket science.
http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/01/06/rocket_science/#more

Here's another article that, while perhaps not offering ways to stop Hamas, puts the situation in a larger framework:
*Steve Clemons at the Washington Note:*
&gt;I told him that in my view America's increasingly consequential failures to generate stability in the Middle East is like an eroding levee in New Orleans -- and those levees at some point are going to fail leaving Israel quite vulnerable unless Israel and other stakeholding neighbors achieve a different equilibrium in the region. . .and soon. There is great doubt around the world in the ability of America to pursue and achieve its objectives -- and this doubt has consequences for Israel's national security calculus, whether it is acknowledging it or not.

&gt;...But as Brzezinski said, the Israelis and Palestinians have proven unable to rise to a level of strategic, forward-looking maturity to solve this problem and others now need to stabilize the situation, engage in a credible peace negotiation process that involves the other major Arab stakeholders, the US and Europe.
http://www.thewashingtonnote.com/archives/2009/01/watching_death/

And this may be the best of the three articles:
*Daniel Levy at TPM Cafe:*
&gt;In this respect it is reminiscent of the dynamic in Lebanon in 2006 where it took 33 days to get a U.N. Security Council Resolution (1701) and an end to violence. This time on day 10, things may, in some short-term respects, look good for Israel but this is unlikely to be the case by day 33.  An America that again sits on the sidelines and does not help work towards an urgent ceasefire is doing Israel no favors. 

&gt;So what needs to happen next? The elements for a ceasefire are known - ending the rocket strikes, violence and military incursions in a sustainable way, ending the blockade on Gaza, preventing new arms from entering Gaza and international monitoring for these arrangements/border crossings -- now they need to be stitched together.  For that to work, Hamas needs to be a party to the ceasefire arrangements.  The alternatives - ongoing Israeli occupation, Israel handing control to the PA or international/Arab forces are either highly unrealistic or highly undesirable and dangerous.  However, if Israel does get tempted to go for regime change and removing Hamas then these become the only options that are left, and Gaza will descend into the kind of lawless chaos which is a gift to al-Qaeda style Salafists and will create a Somalia on its doorstep.

You:
&gt;How about, the people who lived where what is now Israel?

How about them? They are now called Palestinians, but there was no group that called themselves that in 1948. The notion that they somehow deserve their own land seems odd to me, it seems like a very modern notion of nationalism. In 1948 there were Palestinian Arabs and Palestinian Jews, but no ""Palestinians"". The big issue for most of the last 100 years was whether Arab nationality was more important that Islamic nationality. Very few of the borders that we see today as set lasted more than 50 to 100 years. For example the biggest reason Lebanon is a separate country is that France (for reasons that would seem odd today) wanted influence/control of Syria and so a line was drawn that we see as the Israel-Jordan/Lebanon-Syria borders. Under the Turks that was all one place. (Well, it was for some time and at various times, borders moved a lot.)

So, no, the Palestinians are not taking the blame for Europe or for the Arabs. The Palestinians are Arabs and take the blame for their own actions.

&gt;The ceasefire is to be absolute, binding both the IDF and all the militant groups in Gaza. Should the truce hold, and after several days, Israel stands to reopen the Karni and Sufa goods crossings, allowing large quantities of food, fuel, building materials and other goods into the strip, in order to facilitate its economy.
 
&gt;Once the Karni and Sufa crossings open – and prior to the reopening of the Rafah crossing – the negotiations to release kidnapped IDF soldier Gilad Shalit are to be accelerated.

&gt;Both Israel and Egypt have linked the opening of Rafah crossing to Shalit's release. As far as the Egyptians are concerned, opening the crossing would require Hamas to agree to Palestinian Authority forces and EU monitors to be stationed in the crossing in a supervising capacity.

Looking at the list of [rocket and mortar attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rocket_and_mortar_attacks_in_Israel_in_2008)  continuing through the months of the supposed ceasefire reveals Israel opening crossings, then often temporarily closing crossings near to rocket and mortar attacks. 

Examples: June 30th, also, 

&gt;July 2, 2008: There were no rocket or mortar attacks so Israel reopens the four Gaza crossings on Wednesday July 2. Since a truce began June 19, Israel has closed the passages a total of six days in retaliation for rocket attacks.

&gt;July 3, 2008: A rocket lands in an open area north of Sderot. A previously unknown organization calling itself the ""Badr Forces"" claims responsibility for the attack. In response Israel temporarily closes the crossings on July 4, 2008.

&gt;July 7, 2008: A mortar shell is fired at Israel from Gaza on Monday and lands near the Karni crossing.

&gt;July 8, 2008: After two mortar attacks from Gaza at the Sufa crossing, one fell just inside Gaza and the other at the crossing. Israel closed all the crossing. After an Egyptian request they reopened the crossings. Hours after the crossings opened at noon, militants fired another shell into Israel, causing no casualties or damage, the Israeli military said. Israel kept the crossings open. No Palestinian group immediately claimed responsibility.

&gt;In all, 15 rockets and mortars have been fired from Gaza since the truce took effect on June 19. Israel has responded automatically by snapping shut the crossings, which have been closed about half of the time. So far the truce has not eased conditions in Gaza because of the frequent closures. "

The Jews and the Palestinians are really just the same people with different religions. They are from the same area and neither has a valid claim that the land belong to them entirely. The sound and rather look alike. 

Israel was never setup to kill Palestinians. They've been trying to form a homeland there for thousands of years, it has absolutely nothing to do with the Palestinians except they  are from the same region. 

Israel does however abuse it's power and position. But it's not because of some clandestine reason. It's because Palestinians are persistent little bastards that won't give up even in the face of overwhelming odds. 

They are so stubborn and passionate they don't even blink resorting to suicide bombing and targeting civilians. It takes decades of oppression usually to drive a civilized man to that. 

But the desire for the rest of the world for these two idiotic nations to stop fighting is real. The west really only backs Israel because it feel obligated, they've been our long time ally. If anything it costs us billions in extra fuel costs because of all the added conflict primarily centering around Israel, which I think is safe to say why the hate the idea of any permanent western base or such.

It was never a protective ground.

It was clearly an alternative to having all the jews immigrate into Europe. We just put them with their own people really. It was either there Syria or Egypt and basically Palestine fought back the least :P

Few people realize Europe's Jew phobia drove the creation of Israel more than anything. But most populations fear large waves of immigrants. All that Nazi propaganda probably didn't help either.

Indians overall don't seem to have a lot of dislike for anthropologists. We tend to preserve your culture more than you do. In this instance though I'm not hip on the lies you are telling.

Wow, ""we tend to preserve your culture more than you do"", that's quite a patronizing statement. I am sure those cultures you preserve enjoy being seen as static concepts in museums. Librarians also see themselves as preservers of English culture. Those kids in England today are just shav savages, not at all representative of English at all.

&gt; The epidemics if you actually read my posts and relevant research on this field would show you pretty nanimously that Europeans didn't go out of their way to spread disease, it was just a consequence of those with more diseases in their culture but stronger immune systems encountering cultures with fewer diseases and weaker immune systems. This is attributable to most of the Americas not doing much in the way of animal domestication. It doesn't matter if lower estimates don't make sense to you or not. You cite estimates as facts when even those making the estimates know they aren't facts and that there is little agreement on the matter.

I previously implied that the colonizers ""didn't go out of their way to spread disease"", so I don't understand why you assume I believe otherwise. My argument was that economic exploitation (through tribute and enslavement for mining, for example) worsened the plagues (and famines). And I explicitly stated that the lower estimates don't make sense *to me*, I am not citing them as fact. I just think the middle-high estimates make more sense, and since there's no consensus, then I don't see the problem with having an opinion.

&gt; Most of the deaths occurred after first encounters with Europeans trough disease transmission which was the absolutely most devastating thing that happened to American Indians. Europeans in some cases exploited this and in others made deals with different Indian groups.

In many cases the deaths preceded first contact with Europeans, which also implies that population density was high enough over large parts of the Americas to permit this. Yet another reason why I don't agree with the lower estimates. Alliances with Europeans was well documented, and I have no issue with this, but those native allies were promptly ""backstabbed"" by the Europeans, as was the case with the Purepecha civilization, so they gained little in the long term and cannot be accused of having benefitted from the economic exploitation (much).

&gt; Zorita exaggerated his claims to expedite action to wrest control from the encomederos and had arrived on the scene after disease devastated the natives, not before. You are citing him as a witness to something he did not witness.

What? Zorita states ""these people, common to all the Indies, are diminishing in number and coming to an end ... because of the great affliction that the tributes and charges have on them; and I found this out *visiting myself*"" (my translation and emphasis). *He* said he witnessed it, but *you* know better, because you're an anthropologist?  And again, he spoke of the economic exploitation, not the disease, which you don't even address. For the views of Motolinía and Mendieta, see Kubler. As to the Republics of Naturals and the Republics of Spanish you allude to, maybe it could have been a good idea, but failed due to the inability of the colonial authorities to decide exactly how to maintain this ""apartheid"" system. In mine at least, it seem to have worked fine until the late 1800s, but it was rather isolated to begin with.

I find it amusing though that some anthropologists can claim populations were decreasing (which I don't really disagree with, population fluctuations are normal) with so much certainty. Almost like saying ""look, it doesn't matter that the Europeans came there and enslaved millions and millions more died of alien diseases, they were dying out anyway!"". Populations undoubtedly decreased locally during the Mayan and Olmec and Teotihuacan and Cahokian collapses, but increased afterwards elsewhere. There's no reason to believe it wouldn't have done the same if not for the Old World diseases.

As far as I know, I don't think anyone knows what cocoliztli is but Nahua today use the term for plagues in general, so maybe it was just a general term for unrelated diseases with similar symptoms. Regardless, if you don't even know what it was, how can it be cited as a reason for population decrease? Well, I guess anthropologists could say, ""people died because they were sick"", but that just sounds rather... pointless.

&gt; In fact in the book you cited earlier by Thornton you might notice around page 40 that Thornton is pretty clear that war and violence played very little in the decline of Indian populations.

I didn't cite anything, but I think it could be argued also that enslavement is a sort of violence, as well as demanding tribute in times of agricultural crisis, but maybe this Thornton just has his own, very personal definition. Maybe he thinks Palestinians civilians in Gaza without water or food are not victims of Israeli aggression either.

&gt; Dr. Philip D. Curtin based on skeletal studies stated ""shows conclusively that however much it may have deteriorated on contact with the outer world, it was far from paradisiacal before the Europeans and Africans arrived.""

Only naive individuals believe that the Americas were a paradise before the Europeans though, but at least the natives could aspire to be more of less alive and free, and have some land, and maybe even some sovereignty. It sounds like your arguing ""because it wasn't perfect, then a whole lot worse should be tolerable"".

&gt; In the larger Indian societies there was a good deal of social stratification. The poorest made up the masses, ate the worst and least diverse diets and were most likely to get sick and spread the illness through the city as well as die earlier and earlier. Most pre-Columbian cities didn't have plumbing (I can't recall any but I may just be forgetting some).
&gt; The healthiest groups were the most nomadic, the hunter-gatherers that might actually survive until they were 50 as opposed to 35 which was otherwise the oldest most could hope to live to in the best of circumstance.

Sources? As you say, animal domestication, the precursor of capitalism in the Old World, never caught on in the New World. The poorer, as the majority of the population, were also the producers, and hence had first access to foodstuff. Since transport was all human-powered, then I don't understand how someone eight hours from a urban center would eat worse or less diverse than the merchants in the urban center. Urban poor certainly had it tough, but that's the case everywhere and there was no New World exceptionalism.

&gt; Your assertions simply hold little water when the person you are saying them to happens to know better. Downmod away if you must.

Sorry to burst your bubble, but you didn't really address my initial argument, and what you did say is illogical or contradictory. I'm gonna upmod you so other see your foolishness."

The West backs Israel because of the powerful lobbies. These lobbies existed at least since the middle of the 19th century.

&gt; It was either there Syria or Egypt and basically Palestine fought back the least :P

No. You are totally uninformed about the history of the region. Palestine was chosen by the World Zionist Organization in the late 1800s. Since then, the WZO started a big PR campaign in the West to enhance their goal, with such lies as ""a land with no people for a people with no land"". With the fall of the Ottomans after WW1, Britain and France decided to divide the Arab nations amongst them. The WZO pressed on the British government (which, conveniently, had many sympathetic Jews), and got them to come up with the [Balfour Declaration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration_of_1917). If you read this declaration, and every other official British declaration of the time, you will notice that there is no mention of the Palestinians as a people, giving the illusion that the establishment of a Jewish state will not affect anybody, and nullifying themselves from any promises toward an independent Arab Palestine (this is in direct contrast to all of the neighbouring Arabic countries, and to almost all other British colonies). In all other British colonies, quasi governments were established made up almost completely of the native population. The heads of these quasi governments answer to the British authorities. In Palestine, by contrast, none of the Arab Palestinians were given any positions in this government. It was composed entirely of European Jewish immigrants.

&gt; Few people realize Europe's Jew phobia drove the creation of Israel more than anything.

True. Zionists started to immigrate to Palestine from the late 1800s. In the 1920s and early 1930s, many started leaving Palestine, mainly to the US. It wasn't until the horrors of the Holocaust that European Jews started moving into Palestine in greater numbers. In addition to their shear numbers, it brought in money, and skilled labor. This helped increase the difference between Palestinians (who were mostly farmers) and Jews (who were mostly European skilled laborers) in Palestine, effectively giving Zionists the edge it required to achieve critical mass and establish a country."

The British never intended or attempted to settle Palestine with British citizens.

The zionists were not given guns - they acquired and smuggled them mostly from Europe (and they obviously have a bad eye for irony, because that's exactly what the Palestinians are doing nowadays, while Israel is crying foul).

If, however, we launched a full-scale UN-approved war on some genocidal army in Africa and some civilians were killed as a result of the cowardly army bringing the battle into the villages, the world would probably stomach the ""collateral damage.""

In this case, there's so much controversy with the whole Israel/Palestine issue that people who favor Israel will applaud their relatively low civilian casualties, while people who question Israel's legitimacy in Gaza will be outraged at every single civilian killed.  

Personally, I don't think it's all that worthwile to debate the morality/appropriateness of Israel's level of civilian casualties right now, because what's far more important is understanding how the Arabs view it.  After all, it doesn't matter whether Americans or Europeans think it's OK; if the surrounding Arabs see it as evil (which they sure as hell do right now), then the violence is only going to beget more violence.

The EU has tried desperately to delay intervention, turn a blind eye and hope that all will be self-resolved. Ukraine has tried unsuccessfully to drag in other reluctant authorities to stand up to another more powerful and formidable counterparty. Russia is calling everyone else bluff to demonstrate the one ineluctable point that her point is the only valid point, fair or otherwise. 

Anyone else thinks that Ukraine is the victim of Russian bigotry? They bought it on themselves for mouthing off with a superior force and not having the right stance to meet words with action. Now that prices are heading around $450 per unit of delivery, Ukraine is forced to mince its own words and eat it. Ukraine had a good arrangement to collect transit fees and enjoyed the fruits of significantly discounted gas from Russia. Not quite content however, its futile attempt at demonstrating sovereignty and all that chest beating will bear a dear cost on her ailing, fledging economy.

Disproportionate compared to what? Progressive means questioning nonsense when you hear it. What counts as proportionate? Tell me.

&gt;a true fight for justice to collectively punish &gt;them?

disproportionate, collective punishment. Got any other buzz words? 

Look. There are casualties in any war. The question in this case, who is responsible for them? The most obvious and non-critical (and wrong) answer is to blame Israel. 

But what about when the population's fighers using actual civilians as protection? Surely Israel can't be blamed for that. What about having fighters dress as civilians and yet still carry out attacks (like suicide bombers)? What about storing military equipment (bombs etc.) in people's homes.

How is Israel supposed to defend itself in that situation and not kill any civilians? How?!

Any *normal* populace would stop fighting and surrender if they were to face the overwhelming military disparity that wee see between Israel and the Arabs living in palestine. But they won't ever surrender when people like you and Arabs and Persians support them financially and politically.

&gt;If you are interested in educating people on &gt;media bias and subjective perception you should &gt;be discussing your ideas in the philosophy &gt;section. Or maybe you could start talking like &gt;this on some pro Israeli posts or sites to be &gt;fair and balanced.

Pro-Israeli people don't need this information. 

&gt;We all know what happened in WW2 - we grow up &gt;with it through TV, films and books. I don't &gt;want to sound trite but believe me when I say I &gt;cried in The Pianist at the inhumanity and &gt;injustice of what happened in the Warsaw Ghetto &gt;to name but one example. But what happened to &gt;the Jews under Nazi Germany should not be used &gt;as a big stick to silence opposing views and &gt;discussion by crying anti-semitism and genocide &gt;all the time. If anything the suspicion is that &gt;Israel uses this as a way of leveraging &gt;colonial power.

What you know of WW2 is very superficial. What about the Arab and Muslim oppression of Jews? What about Arabs and Muslims siding with the Nazi's in WW2? What about the founder of the PLO, haj amin al huseini, engineering much of the holocaust? You know nothing about this stuff. It's not your fault, but if you cried when watching holocaust films, you may kill yourself if you ever find out the truth and realize that you have been helping to spread lies about Israel. Especially when the Jews of Israel get pushed into the sea. Another genocide. This will happen unless people like you see what you are doing.

&gt;I do wonder what has happened to the people who &gt;left Europe to build a new life in the promised &gt;land. It seems to me that they have become not &gt;dissimilar to something they thought they left &gt;behind. It is telling that the first attacks &gt;happened almost at the end of hanukkah and on &gt;the Shabbat.

What happened was they were attacked since Day 1. Ever hear of the war for Israel in 1948 when about six Arab countries attacked Israel at once, all the while murdering and raping the population of 800000 jews that lived in their countries? That's what happened. 

As you mentioned, all stories have multiple sides and all stories about Israel are filtered through those past atrocities carried out against them.

&gt;What do you call a situation where a population &gt;have been herded into a location where all &gt;access to that location is tightly controlled &gt;by an occupying force, where starvation, &gt;disease and access to jobs, food, power and &gt;medical supplies are limited to the barest &gt;minimum?

What do you call it when a nation (The Arabs of Jordan, Syria, and Egypt) sacrifices a small percentage of their population (Palestinian Arabs), by herding them into a small region (because they won't let them enter into Syria or Egypt either!), and then brain washing them to repeatedly attack the more powerful country (Israel), by convincing them that they should be martyrs--that paradise awaits if they are killed while fighting ""The Zionist Occupiers""?

&gt;And what sorts of words would you use if they &gt;fought back?

When Israel fights back the words are Aggressor, Occupier, and Zionists. THE SAME WORDS HAMAS and IRAN USE."

My ancestors were told by God that this house was to be theres. So, they went and took it from some lousy group of Cannonites. Then my ancestors were ravaged by the romans and palestinians and they took my house from me.

[Not quite](http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/966952.html). The Palestinians are the original descendants of those who have lived in that land for the last ten thousand years, including Jews in Roman times who later converted to Islam. Genetically, Palestinian Jews and non-Jews are identical. European Jews are mostly descendants of converts who lived in other areas, not direct descendants of Palestinian Jews who migrated.

To wit: *""I started looking in research studies about the exile from the land - a constitutive event in Jewish history, almost like the Holocaust. But to my astonishment I discovered that it has no literature. The reason is that no one exiled the people of the country. The Romans did not exile peoples and they could not have done so even if they had wanted to. They did not have trains and trucks to deport entire populations. That kind of logistics did not exist until the 20th century. From this, in effect, the whole book was born: in the realization that Judaic society was not dispersed and was not exiled.""*

Besides, if people are supposed to give up their land to other people based on myths that are thousands of years old, then none of us are safe in our beds.

They don't have the option to live free.

&gt;It gives Isreal a reason to basically do anything. 

Israel doesn't need a reason. It does what it wants.

&gt;If they would stop sending those rockets then Israel would start opening up the borders

No it wouldn't. Hamas did stop their rockets. israel didn't open the borders.

&gt;If they still wouldn't do that then the world would turn away the support from Israel rather fast.

Nope. The world has never turned away from israel no matter what israel has done.

&gt;In the eyes of the world one of the most important things is that contracts are kept. 

Israel broke the ceasefire.

&gt;And despite actions which seem horrible beyond description Isreal has to my knowledge so far shown to keep true to the contracts and to their words.

Israel broke the ceasefire.

&gt;I still hope they stop.

You don't and they won't.

&gt;I even would like to see them stop unconditionally. 

You don't and they won't.

&gt;. I urge them whatever they do as military action to keep on supporting the civilian population in Palestina.

You don't and they won't.

&gt;. But even if they do it seems rather obvious that there will be no peace and it will start all over again in a few months/years.

That's right. The root cause must be addressed and that is the occupation.

Until the occupation is lifted there can be no peace.

&gt;The only way out is building up trust between the nations.

Palestine is not a nation. The gaza strip and the west bank are israeli occupied territories and not nations recognized by the UN, Israel, EU, or the US.

&gt;And that can only come from keeping contracts - or at least I don't know any other way.

Israel broke the ceasefire.

Even zionist entities like NY times, wikipedia and CNN say so.

Along with the ceasefire israel has broken every promise it has ever made including stopping the settlements, payment of reparations, lifting embargo etc.

they are also in violation of dozens of international laws.

Not that you give a flying fuck of course.

# Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and the pursuit of protectionist economic measures.

# Restricting foreign aid to the support of countries receiving repatriated members of ethnic minorities. Griffin argued against giving unconditional foreign aid, including disaster aid, claiming charity is not an acceptable use of public funds.

# The introduction of corporal punishment for petty criminals and vandals, and the introduction of capital punishment for paedophiles and terrorists and its reintroduction for murderers.

# The reintroduction of national service and the deprivation of some civil rights from conscientious objectors, including the right to vote.

# The requirement of all law-abiding adults completing national service to maintain a standard issue automatic rifle in their home.

""The economy of Israel is diversified with substantial government ownership and a rapidly developing high-tech sector. Poor in natural resources, Israel depends on imports of petroleum, coal, food, uncut diamonds, other production inputs, and military equipment. In May 2007, Israel was invited to join the OECD.[3]

The country's GDP (Purchasing power parity) in 2006 reached $195 billion according to the International Monetary Fund or $179 billion according to the World Bank (see List of countries by GDP (PPP)). GDP per capita has been $31,767 according to the International Monetary Fund in 2007 or $26,200 in 2006 according to the CIA World Factbook. $31,767 is on par with most Western European countries like France or Italy, while $26,200 is lower than most Western European countries, except Portugal but higher than all Eastern European countries and close to the average for the European Union (see List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita). The economy grew by 8% in the last quarter of 2006, the fastest growth of any Western nation.[4]

The major industrial sectors include metal products, electronic and biomedical equipment, processed foods, chemicals, and transport equipment. Israel possesses a substantial service sector and the Israel diamond industry is one of the world's centers for diamond cutting and polishing. It is also a world leader in software development and is a major tourist destination. In 1998, Tel Aviv was named by Newsweek as one of the ten most technologically influential cities in the world.[5] ""

Well, I'm far from being an expert in the subject of urban warfare but it seems to me that the tactics of getting around human sheild involves more danger to the Israeli forces. It's easier to blow up a building than to try to take out the bad guy with a bullet.

Also, let's say it is a fact Hamas uses human shields. Let's assume they try to do everything to have civilians around them at all times. The Israeli army knows this. So, you can accuse them all you can, but you're still dropping the bombs on the human shields. A dead woman or child is still dead no matter what amount of words you use to describe how bad Hamas is.

Analogies are never perfect but: terrorists using human shields is like having terrorists seize a building in US our Europe and take a number of hostages. Now, do you deal with the terrorists by blowing up the building, which takes care of the terrorists for sure, but with the unfortunate side effect of killing hostages?

There is no way, using the tactics Israeli do, Hamas militants being where they are, that loss of civilian life could be avoided. Civilians dying is a consequence Israel has accepted when they went to this war. More civilians dying is a consequence Israel accepts if it has proof that Hamas is using human shields and still continues to drop the bombs. 

Another (silly) analogy: you're blindfolded shooting with a gun to one direction. You know for a fact that a bad guy will try to put a woman or a child in the line of fire. Yet you choose to fire your weapon in the hope you kill the bad guy (who does not have any means to harm you, btw)."

They may well be replacing trees, but they're creating a decades-long gap in the water cycle.

&gt;Another problem is that they're setting up an ecological disaster by planting the same species throughout a deforested area. When an entire forest is all made of the same species of tree, and they're all the same age, it becomes an irresistible treat for tree-eating caterpillars, beetles, and fungi, as we've seen in numerous forests in North America and Europe.

&gt;Taking thousands of tons of biomass (fully grown trees and habitat) out of a forest and replacing it with saplings that weigh a few ounces will do little for the downwind areas that need the atmospheric moisture to produce rainfall.  Even by the time the trees regenerate, the ecological diversity and natural fauna and flora of the region have been decimated as the diversity of numerous plant species are replaced by the single-species seedlings used by the loggers.

I disagree. For wage workers that may be so. But for white collar jobs it's arguably better than just about anywhere else in Europe.

Government does not equal people. It *should* represent them but that does not mean if they fail one should feel a duty to not speak out. Is something sinister going on? I'd say yes.  Does that mean you should start spying on your Israeli co-workers?  No.

You've told me you're American.  The actions of the Bush Administration have been criminal, imperialistic and private-venture orientated IMO.  Does that mean I judge all Americans, you included, as being the same.  I don't see one as being indicative of the other.  I have no right to judge you.

For the record I am British and served in the Army.  Trust me I am just as critical as the British government (in fact more so - they've just escaped the spot light in the main) and I am fully aware of the f-ckups, the near f-ckups and the downright stupidity of some that can go hand in hand with sheer expertise, humanity and professionalism of those I once served with.  So could this have just been one monster screw up by some kid, intentionally malicious or not, that goes no higher?  Yes.

Unfortunately it doesn't end there.  Despite early attempts by the media Israel started the escalation.  Even prior to that it failed to meet ceasefire agreements despite evidence that Hamas had tried to.  Prior to the escalation Israeli intelligence themselves state that there was no direct Hamas link to militant action (they did it by proxy - not to make excuses).  I know America had designated Hamas a terrorist organisation but bare this in mind: Australia and the UK both had not.  They had identified a militant wing associated to Hamas (just as they had with Fatah - and western media are now telling us they are the moderates even though their militant wing is very much active) as terrorists but not the diplomatic aspect.  They differentiated to further the prospect of diplomacy.  But what do we see now?  The media is portraying that Hamas is responsible for all rockets out of Gaza.  That is simply not the case - every intelligence agency if you catch them before either the government or the media say exactly the same thing.  There are other groups operating in Palestine launching rockets - putting Hamas as the umbrella for all (without making Hamas to be without fault) is not accurate in the least and yet there is an organised effort to make it just so.

So is something sinister going on?  I'd say yes.  But don't feel bad or that you have to stigmatise all Israelis or Jews with it.  Did you blame all Americans when you thought the Neocons were a piece of sh*t?  [Same concept](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Zionism).
At the Annapolis peace talks organised by the American government Hamas wasn't even invited!!  How can you have peace talks and not invite one of the democratically elected (both UN and EU observers testified that the election was fair, properly carried out and above board)  parties which you're attacking in Gaza whilst inviting their rivals (fatah) in the West Bank?  International bodies, Israeli academics and Palestinians all protested this at the time.  Since then even Israel's PM Olmert has admitted in a more candid moment that the peace talks, if they were to be successful, had to include Hamas. And yet between the trio of US, Israel and Fatah Hamas was never invited.  Now we see a determined effort to make them culpable for everything to justify war even though the world's intelligence services, including the UK and Israel, nearly all reluctantly admit that that is not the case.

If you'll note from that link post zionism doesn't want to make it about religion, want to respect the greenline borders (1947).  The head of Hamas has since said that it would even be willing to recognise Israel under such conditions!  [AND SO DID THE 22 STATE ARAB LEAGUE!](http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2007-07-25-mideast_N.htm) (for the record the Israeli government rejected it) but all the while **it would be unfair for people to not recognise the great number of Israeli people who do denounce the escalation, do condemn the war, do speak out about the Palestinian humanitarian crisis (b'tselem), do have the courage or the conviction to refuse to serve in either the forces or the Occupied territories (yesg gvul)and do talk about both aspects in the media (typically Haaretz).**

The short of it is, don't be afraid to criticise the Israeli government, their actions or those that support it (same goes for Palestine Authorities) and think that in some way you can't at the same time support both the Israeli and Palestinian people.  You can.

If I was focusing on the first epidemics I wouldn't have referenced more than one epidemic. The first hit the hardest and all the others also hit pretty damn hard. When a series of epidemics kills off 80%, 80% and then 40% that is a gigantic number that you keep trying to pin on everything else. Correlation does NOT equal causation no matter how many times you try to imply that it does.

Any disease that person had now gets passed on to another population group. What the hell are you even trying to argue with that anyways?


So why were the Incans growing corn? Probably for the same reason that it was grown over most of the New World. Because there were very extensive trade networks. Aztec and Incan cultures may never have traded directly but through intermediaries. It's intellectually dishonest to act as though there was no exchange. The Aztecs traded as far north as modern day USA and as far south as modern day Columbia. At least part of Columbia was part of the Incan empire.


Actually a lot of people who had ancestors that possessed genetic immunities to small pox also found themselves immune to the plague in Europe.  That same immunity also provides an immunity to common strains of HIV/AIDS for some people as well. Cities large and small were also very proactive about setting up quarantines after they started figuring out more about the way it was spreading. In some cases town quarantined themselves after they were infected to prevent spreading of the plague. Now considering that the plague spread along trade routes and very likely originated from China why do you think it was spread because of population density? Certainly the more densely a city is populated the more people would contract it however that has little to do with how fast it spread throughout Europe and yet another thing to consider is that the plague generally killed people within 2-3 days of contracting it. Most European cities at the time of that plague had 1,000 or fewer people though a small handful did have 50,000 or more.


By 1520 (Zorita was about 8 years old at this point of time, was he writing about the errors of Europeans in the New World when he was 8?) at least one smallpox epidemic had devastated Mexico killing as many as perhaps 50% of the inhabitants at the time with at least one more large epidemic moving through the area in 1531 (most likely measles). Zorita arrived in 1547. There were other major epidemics besides the two I mentioned but I really only need one to show you as wrong. You are also trying to draw a pretty lame comparison between Stalin, Mao and myself. The reason it didn't have much to do with it is because the groups had been experiencing *economic exploitation* since before any Europeans had come to the New World. This is how larger societies in the New World supported themselves. The only difference between the cultures of the New World and Old World is that the benefactors became Europeans instead of the Aztec or Inca and those goods may have been shipped to a different city. It was a condition that existed, in a more severe form no doubt before contact, thus its impact would be minimal which is not the same as beneficial. You are blaming Europeans for what the natives did in pre-Columbian times.

You’ve twice agreed with the 70million figure or close to it anyways. I’m not trying to defend in any way what happened due to European contact or occupation. What I am trying to do is show that many horrible things that happened were incidental rather than purposeful. You on the other hand seem to want to imply that the majority of deaths were purposeful and that every European that came over was trying to make life a living hell for the natives. 

Macehual worked for the state and had very few opportunities to escape that burden. You can replace macehual with serf and it would still be an accurate statement. Aztec slaves were often lumped into the same social class as the macehual. They didn’t live in a world with steel (though they did make some tools out of copper)or iron or horses though they certainly made use of copper and had capital it just wasn’t in the form of money.
Calpulli? I’m sorry but you seem to be making a strange argument here. There were what 10-20 calpulli for the largest Aztec city Tenochtitlan? The Aztecs built their empire on the subjugation of other people. That’s how they supported themselves and had the labor to feed the empire.
Dogs came from Asia in the same way the Aztecs came from Asia. Muscovy ducks had been domesticated at least a few centuries before any European contact and before Aztecs really blossomed as a culture. Turkey had been domesticated in most of the Americas by different groups at different times. De Soto noted pens of domesticated deer in Florida and other Spaniards noted domesticated deer in Mesoamerica, especially in the Yucatan peninsula by Mayans. I think you may be using an odd definition of domestication.
Lacking analytical thought? I’m sorry but when all signs point to something and you say they point somewhere else the issue is with you not with everything else.

It is in fact one of the reasons why osteological remains are studied is because we can in many cases tell where they came from and return them.

The reason why I liken you to some *white-guilt laden college student more than an Indian* is because of your mannerisms where I am supposed to feel bad about something that happened 350 years ago and had no involvement in and I am supposed to just blithely accept your criticisms of me based on what happened 350 years ago.

Language is culture thus one who studies language studies culture. Only recently have people started to create divisions in it for whatever reasons.

&gt;I am correlating the Colonial-policy-induced agricultural crisis and exploitation with the plagues. Europeans caused the severe economc exploitation and slavery and their policies caused the severe agricultural crises, which led to famine. And both of these are correlated to the plagues. I think you're just not understanding or I am not being clear here. Look at the example of the Irish Potato Famine. The direct cause was the blight, but it was British agricultural policy that cause the severe famine. I've already mentioned two similar examples.

The groups hit by these famines were already being exploited by the natives. This is how the Aztecs especially supported themselves. As I said before the Europeans simply became the new benefactors of it. There were also environmental issues that occur every so often which helped worsen the famine. Surely you aren't suggesting that Spaniards were the cause of droughts? This has little to do with the Irish Potato Famine. That came about because potatos were the best mass food option at the time and a disease wiped them out. To relate this to anything in the Americas would have to involve maize crops dying off due to disease or infestation.

The Darien gap is a modern impediment, difficult to build roads and a lot of guerrillas as well as worry of environmental impact. Polynesians got sweet potatoes according to popular theories by actually travelling to South America and going back with them. Polynesians are pretty well know to have travelled extensively by boat. You are trying to create doubt where there is none. Meanwhile Aztec trading areas and the extent of the Incan  empire either overlapped or came very close. I do see the point you are trying to make but corn was brought there over land or via canoe. Aztecs are documented to have traded down io Ecuador, Ecuador being a part of the Incan empire. Both the Aztecs and Incans were known for having long distance runners able to cover something like 200 miles a day.

I'm wondering why you are still denying that many cultures in the New World had long and extensive trading routes. You just seem to want to harp on population density damn everything else. How fast a disease spreads also has more to do with how resistant a group is to the disease and how fast it will bring on death. If something kills within a day it won't spread far more than likely unless it can be carried by people who are resistant to it. You also assume all or most travel done in Europe was done by horse or cattle.

&gt;I am not sure what you're trying to ""prove"" here. Do you think that the plagues stopped in 1547? All through Colonial times epidemics wiped out large percentages of the native population and Colonial policies can be linked to them.

First I did not imply that eopidemics ceased. I said Zorita *had arrived on the scene after disease devastated the natives, not before,* which is accurate and does not imply that disease ceased. Catholic missionaries tried replacing corn with wheat due to the religious signifigance corn for the natives.

Spaniards did what the Aztecs did. They didn't *take land* they ruled it and benefitted from it and they did it to a similar degree except that there were now fewer Aztecs due to their susceptability to diseases.

&gt;I never said or thought ""every European that came over was trying to make life a living hell for the natives"", that's you. If you're just trying to prove that many of the ""horrible things"" were just incidental, then you failed. Perhaps some were incidental but evidence points to people being aware even back then that most were far from incidental and driven by greed and the desire for power. You might not be trying to defend imperialism and genocide, but you certainly make seem much less worse than it was.

You may not be saying that outright but pretty much everything you've posted is screaming it. You got indignant at the mere mention that someone's numbers were a pretty high estimate and since then you have been contradicting pretty much every historical and archeological record. Yes I'm sure you can show that Spaniards gave measles and small pox to the natives to make it easier to conquer. Spanish greed dictated they gave the Aztecs the cold. I'm not making it seem more or less worse than it was. I'm trying to convey what happened.

&gt;Last points: Capital the word is derived from the world for cattle. Wealth existed in pre-Columbian Mexico, but it was largely perishable and mean capitalism and capital could not ""increase"". The dynamics of their economic system where therefore vastly different from those of the Old World.

So you default to a weak semantic argument? You act like their wealth was nothing more than perishable goods. The dynamics were the same. They used military power to exploit weaker neighbors and extract tribute.

&gt;The term calpulli is used for the smallest non-family subdivision of society, which extended beyond cities, and their structure is well understood and serfdom it was not.

I didn't say calpulli were serfs. A calpulli may have existed between cities but I can't think of any. They were based on a city. It would be more like a city  commission of families which I admit is not the best analogy though it is more accurate than what you wrote. I assume it is used differently in modern usage.

&gt;A tame animal is an individual or a group of individuals from a normally wild species that has become accustomed to humans, while a domesticated animal is a new species that had been selectively bred by humans from a tame population.

You aren't using the correct definition for domestication. A domesticated muscovy duck is the same species as a wild muscovy duck or a feral muscovy duck and in all three cases are the same species the same as dogs and wolves are the same species.

&gt;Do Muscovy ducks and Turkeys fall into one or the other? Evidence points to both, since modern breeds were created much later. Tame deer (or elephants) are not domesticated though.

What do you mean fall into one or the other? Tame or domesticated? Deers have been domesticated in various parts of the world and elephants, at least captive bred ones, are considered domesticated."

Less than 1000 dead and all you left wing do-gooders are complaining. Where was the complaining in WW2 when 200,000 japs died in tokyo in one night of bombing (more than the atomic strikes!), where was the outrage when us the british decided to bomb german cities before they bombed ours, where was the outrage when millions of russians died during the siege of stalingrad????
you see my point?!

it is clear as anything that 1000 deaths is a tiny amount when a country is at war. us brits are famous for our 'courage and sense of humour during the Blitz and these arabs are hiding like rats behind their PR.

thank you...

ps. if Israel falls to Islam fanatics, Europe will be next. Israel is on the frontline with the war against Iran and the spread of fanatical Islam. Now is time to choose whose side you're on cos if there is gonna be a 3rd world war it will be with the US, Europe, India and israel vs Islam.

Here's a great review, the author is not a religious person:

&gt;Conceptually, there really is nothing more that Dawkins could have added to the subject, and accordingly, he has added nothing. The only conclusion that I can reach – a distressing conclusion for one who has been more than an ardent admirer of Dawkins - is that he was seduced into the enterprise of writing The God Delusion by the opportunity firstly of playing to the gallery, and secondly, by the prospect of earning a lot of money from the bankable sales to be expected when a high-profile author piles into a lowest-common denominator debate: is there a god or isn’t there?

&gt;No, “consciousness raising” is ever the work of party publicists, propagandists, public relations practitioners and advertising people, of spin doctors, and of people who seek to manipulate public perceptions in their own interest. Consciousness has got nothing to do with understanding, with the often arduous business of learning a new fact, or of mastering a body of knowledge. It has got nothing to do with wit, wisdom or insight.

&gt;However then did Richard Dawkins, illustrious scientist, get caught up in so disreputable a business as the writing of a large book with the preposterous aim of raising the world’s level of consciousness? It seems that he draws his inspiration for so doing by the success of the women’s movement in making most males - and presumably a not insignificant number of females – sensitive to the sexism embedded in our language.

&gt;You may think I am going on about this a bit too much. But it helps me identify the source of the bad odour that emanates from this book, the odour of dishonesty. His new-found enthusiasm for “conscious raising” is opportunistic. It provides what he takes to be a defensible justification for placing such a book before the public in the want of any more legitimate reasons for doing so. To argue about the existence or otherwise of god is a jejune enterprise that in polite society is rightly regarded as bad form. It is a useless, tiresome, noisy and utterly pointless endeavour: you say “I believe in god”, I say “I don’t believe in god”. There is no resolution to this difference in beliefs, and there the matter must rest.

&gt;Analogously, he is like Macbeth, who – in mounting his horse – leaps clean over it, and falls in a heap on the other side. The suggestion embedded in the image is that, without the counter-balancing resistance of conscience, Macbeth’s ambition is out of control, and creates a dysfunctionality that renders him gauche, incapable, and bereft of human capacity.  He cannot even judge the effort required to leap onto his horse. Dawkins, it hardly needs me to observe, clearly does have a great mind, but in the absence of matter to engage with, it is rendered similarly both gauche and dysfunctional. Lacking a real subject, he doesn’t really have an enterprise. 

&gt;t’s easy enough to provide a list of all the bad things in history you can lay at the door of religion, as he readily does, but to be even-handed, you also need to account for the origin of non-religious evil such as was incarnated in people like Stalin, Hitler (no-one could seriously argue that it was his Christianity that motivated Hitler’s desire for lebensraum), Pol-Pot, Amin or Mugabe, or which inspired the Japanese in WW 2.

&gt;The raising of consciousness isn’t the only opportunistic position Dawkins takes up. Making an overt comparison with the world of homosexuality and the fears of public recognition it often entails, he also writes, he tell us, to encourage closet atheists to come out into the open. “My dream” he says, “is that this book may help people to come out”.  Again, I must report that I find myself plainly incredulous. Certainly in the worlds I am reasonably conversant with – Britain, Western Europe, the Commonwealth, perhaps even Canada – it is risible to suggest any comparison between “coming out of the closet”, and “admitting” to being an atheist! Why, all of 40 years ago, on campuses in England, you needed courage to admit to being a Christian, not an atheist! It was a major social indiscretion to be caught going to church on a Sunday morning, and nobody in serious argument quoted from the Bible. Christianity as an aspect of public life in Britain is under siege. South Africa, for instance, is constituted as a secular state (and so also, surprisingly, is Italy). But it is a symptom of the contrived nature of Dawkins’s enterprise that he has continually to inflate the social problem he nominally diagnoses (delusional belief in god) in order to justify attacking it.

&gt;Dawkins is himself not immune to a sense of mystery. He describes himself as a boy: “…tearful with the unheard music of the Milky Way.” What exactly, we are entitled to ask him in the context of the book he has written, did he hear, and why should it have made him tearful? We may congratulate ourselves on our status as rational scientists when we avoid images of patriarchal gods in the sky, and substitute in their place words like “transcendent wonder” (Sagan’s phrase, approved by Dawkins), or “pantheistic reverence” (Dawkins’s phrase) but I find it hard to believe that wonder and reverence could be evoked by mere complexity; they are sensations evoked in the face of incomprehensibility and mystery. And if the wonder is transcendent, where does the transcendence take us, if not to a place outside of the natural world? Many scientists, he agrees, have a “quasi-mystical response to nature and the universe”, but how, I am led to wonder, does “quasi-mystical” differ from “mystical”? Is it mystical or is it not?

Add on to that how stable most European countries are (and the US, Canada, and Australia which are all countries where Europeans displaced and killed off the native people) and the lopsided economic deals that were made with Westerners right after many of colonial powers left and it seems evident that there is correlation.

Also, one of the things that rarely gets mentioned during talks about colonialism is the suppression of cultural leaders while under European rule. For example, while some of the elites of India learned Western philosophy and while there was some Western cultural influences that spread through all of India, for the most part Indians were kept ignorant due to the British wish for keeping opposition down. In this time, the culture in non-colonized places was allowed to grow in its own right and develop less repressing practices. On the other hand, in India, political and philosophical growth was hampered by the British wish to repress the Indian people. Instead, British controlled education focused on promoting teaching certain elites that the Britons were the ones who brought in all positive cultural ideas and Indians brought in all negative cultural ideas. This created a class of people Indians who held contempt for most Indians but full of admiration for England. Once the British people left, the Indian people had to restart the education and ruling system and had to restart Indian cultural growth and because of that, many outdated cultural practices remain today that aren't present in non-colonized places."

Now, Tucows is much better, and there are other registrars popping up who have a higher cause. RealtimeRegister.com has an awesomely simple system and is willing to work with Americans. I wrote them once with a complaint, and they responded within 24 hours with a price modification and better offer.

Godaddy never writes back, or rarely enough that I consider it never.

I've already switched several of my domains to a tucows affiliate with no little satisfaction, and I'm engaging with RR to become an official reseller of their registration process.

That means, redditors, I'll be able to register .coms and .orgs for about half  of what godaddy currently charges. Maybe less.

These are not the only two options. Lots of registrars are popping up in northern european nations and asian nations which I would trust further than I trust the USA. 

I have formed the firm opinion that one should never register with a registrar from within a censoring nation. One should also never obtain hosting from the same registrar, as this gives them too much power over your content. They could do more than just take out the DNS, they could erase the site.

realtimeregister.com for domains, and pick your non-censoring host by nations with the best freedoms. Add to this comment thread if there are still better deals out there. I'm not asking you to give shout outs to your registrar, I'm asking if you know of BETTER security, freedom, and pricing.

Although I have to say I disagree about your first argument rather strongly: the Middle East, compared to everywhere else I can think of, was relatively untouched by Western conquerors. The first European crusade succeeded, all the others failed. Then Europeans appeared again when Napolean invaded Egypt. Other than that, there was a lot of administration in the 1800's  and 1900's, but no real colonialism. Yeman, the United Arab Emirates, and many other countries had little contact with Europeans. Palestine didn't either until 1945. In Africa, the only part of Africa never conquered or ruled by a European power is what turned into Ethiopia and Somalia today, two of Africa's biggest shitholes. Somalia is the perfect example of a country that never had European rule. Of course, so is Japan unless you count post World War II American administration.

I don't see how the stability of European countries helps your point – I don't see as it is related. If you count all the World wars and possibly Bosnia, the European countries fucked themselves up something fierce. The South American countries threw off European rule fairly early on – in the first half of the 1800s. Many of those countries continue to be shitholes, though obviously these are areas of some of the worst colonialism. The difficulty is saying that the strong societies mowed over by European conquerors would have grown up into societies more benevolent than what the society grew into with European rule: Aztecs and Zulus being principal examples. Contrary examples are the Sikhs and the Iroquois league – both of which could have created better future societies. 

That's a really difficult argument to make. There just aren't that many examples of cultures that progressed without European domination. Tribesman in the Amazon, tribesman in Southeast Asia, the Tibetans, China, Afghanistan, Turkey maybe. About the lopsided economic deals – I don’t really know any examples, but you're probably right. Britain's deal with the Shah of Iran was post-colonial, and I think that also supports your contention.

Interesting you bring up India – I've read articles and talked to many Indians who hold the belief that India is far, far, far better off having had British administration than otherwise. Those Indians who would have progressed to powerful positions would, according to these guys, probably not have been benevolent. At least in the manner you or I would agree ""benevolence"" could be measured. The prejudice I have makes my argument skewed, and I admit it's prejudice – but it's also prejudice shared by the Indians I've talked to. 

&gt; Once the British people left, the Indian people had to restart the education and ruling system and had to restart Indian cultural growth and because of that, many outdated cultural practices remain today that aren't present in non-colonized places.

You're saying the prevalence of the caste system and arranged marriages is more common because of European influence rather than the absence of it. I'm not saying you're wrong, but I'm not quite ready to agree. British influence was strongest in urban centers, far more prevalent than in the villages. Today, more enlightened practices seem to dominate the cities, and be fairly lacking in rural area. While I do agree that this is just the nature of cities, I have to believe that it's also due to British influence.

Oh but your concerned now that the gene is out.

First of all, for the love of G-d please don't bring genetics into it.  It doesn't end well.

Why they didn't protest when Hamas was elected?  Hmmm...let me think. 

 Maybe because they knew the EU and the UN had sent people to monitor the election, THEY ok'd Hamas as a party and they also attested that the election was fair and above board.  That or maybe they're more like the UK or Australia and not the US and Israel in that they have not identified Hamas itself as a terrorist organisation.  The [UK](http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/security/terrorism-and-the-law/terrorism-act/proscribed-groups) and [Australia](http://www.nationalsecurity.gov.au/agd/www/nationalsecurity.nsf/AllDocs/95FB057CA3DECF30CA256FAB001F7FBD?OpenDocument)  only identify Hamas' Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades as being terrorist entities, their militant wing, not the political party itself - so as to encourage diplomacy.  The EU doesn't make this distinction anymore although it is worthwhile noting both [France and Germany](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3100518.stm) wanted to take the UK's and Australia's approach and not persecute the political party for that exact same reasoning.  

Moot point really.  Norway isn't in the EU but maybe they were just thinking along the same lines as these four.

Anyways encouraging diplomacy and democracy was the idea behind making the distinction.
It was working too, having been elected fairly they'd offered and had kept to a ceasefire and they weren't the ones that broke it.  They were even arresting militant groups trying to operate in Gaza.  Public opinion polls at the time showed a growing moderate population backing a 2 state solution with Israel.  At one point it was a majority. We'd have got away with it if it weren't for those pesky IDF kids.

The Israeli Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, funded by the Israeli Government, released a report November 16th saying that: 

&gt;[""since the 'recent' escalation, **for the first time**, there is direct Hamas involvement in the rocket and mortar shell fire""](http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/malam_multimedia/English/eng_n/html/hamas_e011.htm)

So you see.  The Israel government, by breaking the ceasefire as reported on November 5th and the ensuing escalation is actually seen to be having a radicalising effect coaxing the genie out!

It makes sense from the angle that the goal all along was to create an Emmanuel Goldstein to unify against in an attempt to justify collective punishment and ethnic cleansing.

That's why the Norwegians are hitting the streets now.  Apparently they've read Nineteen Eighty-Four.

The Jewish Agency then started to actively buy land from the Arabs during the period of the Mandate.

Things began to get tense, with Arab riots against Jews, and Jewish reprisals (although the official policy of the Haganah, the Jewish self-defense organization, was restraint, there were a couple of Jewish terrorist groups who attacked mostly the British administrators in Palestine, but also took revenge on Arabs). When the Mandate ended the UN divided Palestine up into separate Jewish and Arab entities, but the surrounding Arab countries invaded (presumably in support of the Palestinians, but mostly to carve up the territory for themselves). The Zionists won decisively and ended up with more territory than what was originally granted by the UN. 

It's highly simplistic and unhistorical to presume that the Israelis ""stole"" the land, as many people believe. Perhaps you can make that argument about the settler movement, but the country of Israel's history is not much different than other countries who won their independence through war. So in my opinion they have the right to exist and the right to self-defense. I strongly believe the Palestinians, though country-less, also have the same exact rights to self-defense, however I think that Hamas is only inflicting more war and destruction on their own people by antagonizing Israel."

The g-factor is common to all types of intelligence (I.e. verbal ability, mathematical ability, etc...). A test that measures g accurately is called g-loaded. The traditional IQ test is g-loaded but it is not the most – the best test for that is Raven's progressive matrices (this test is also extremely culture negative since it depends only on basic line drawings). So the best test for “intelligence” would therefore be a g-loaded test. A few interesting things about the g-factor: 

It is innate (I.e. born with) ability.
It is correlated with reaction time. 
It is correlated with future success.
A person with high-g can be identified from fMRI images while he is doing problems (such as RPM) by looking at the brain activity.
It is correlated with brain size and the size of certain areas in the brain.
It is fairly immutable (I.e. can not be changed through training/learning).
It is highly heritable. 

&gt; He said most IQ tests are racially and gender biased. Because back in the day, when they were written, the model for intelligence was based off of white well-to-do males. 

What is your professor's name for interest sake?

The culture bias is something that is frequently used to try and explain the IQ gap between different groups of people. Unfortunately this is not the right reason (the differences still appeared in tests that were “culturally negative”). From WP: 

&gt; The American Psychological Association's report Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns[14] states that IQ tests as predictors of social achievement are not biased against people of African descent since they predict future performance, such as school achievement, similarly to the way they predict future performance for European descent.

The correct answer will probably be interesting and will involve a variety of factors. 

&gt; white well-to-do males.

There is evidence that the average IQ of men and woman doesn't differ significantly. The variance of the IQ differs however (the variance is higher in men). This may explain why there are more top men in a lot of science positions. Just don't mention this hypothesis if you are the [president of Havard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Summers).

&gt; That's the extent of what I know on that, because IQ never really interested me.

Intelligence testing is (for me at least) an extremely interesting subject (that is why I am neglecting my M thesis by reading all this stuff up...). It will become a lot more interesting during the next decade when the brain is understood better. 

Here is an extremely interesting article to read:

Free trade will arbitrage prices across different markets very efficiently, so even if entire countries boycotted Israeli goods their loses would be really tiny - just what it costs to ship their stuff a bit further away, and bulk ocean shipping is unbelievably cheap.

Even government sanctions won't work that well. OPEC once tried to put sanctions against Israel and states supporting Israel, it had surprisingly little effect in spite of large scale of it.

The only way sanctions can work is when large part of the world, many entire markets, boycotts someone. Like - if at least the entire EU decided to put economic sanctions on Israel, that would have some limited effect, as shipping stuff over Atlantic is somewhat expensive. But consumer boycotts? No way in hell.

And neither will Obama administration do anything about Palestinians, nor will the Internet, nor anything else I've heard proposed. The world is inherently an unfair place, and Palestinians just happen to be fucked. It might just happen that Israelis decide to stop genociding Palestinians, but humans are xenophobes by evolutionary design, and are really good at not giving a shit about out-groupers. The best result I can think of would be getting Egypt and Jordan to agree to taking control over Palestine from Israelis, as any solution based on Israelis suddenly deciding to be nice to their out-groupers for altruistic reasons is pure fantasy."

No, that's not right, I'm afraid. That would be better used to describe early-form socialism (ie, a socialist state that is just recovering from capitalism). In the early-forms the governance (whether a central body or soviets as was intended after the october revolution) takes control over industry, and it is still run 'for a profit' but for the profits of the state. As the state moves towards late-term socialism and communism, the need for profits is removed, as the goal is to transition to a state where money does not exist, but that people are working for restitution in forms of other goods.

The 'Soviet Union' was never communist, in fact the term as applied was only valid in that the USSR was governed by a party that called itself 'The Communist Party'. Ditto China and other 'Communist' nations.

If you want to see communism in action, you'll only see it on the small scale at various communes around the world.

Socialism has been modified such that Social Democracy exists, this is the form of socialism that is in use in various parts of europe, where the government attempts to purposefully enter, and stay at, early-form socialism, without the need for revolution.

Most of the names behind communism (Marx, Engels, Trotsky, Lenin) would likely balk at these forms of 'Socialism' since they have no intent nor desire (from the governanece) to progress to late-form socialism or communism itself."

Your are aware there is a subtle distinction between ethnic cleansing and genocide? What Israel does constitutes ethnic cleansing NOT genocide. targeting civilians, illegally confiscating land, illegal settlements on occupied territory etc.

On another note:

Not a Jew myself I grew up in a Jewish environment. My family had (and have) lots of Jewish close friends we had lots of close ties to Israel many of my family went to Israel as volunteers. I remember even before the '67 war there was a general agreement and strong conviction that Israel needed control over the West Bank were it ever to live behind secure borders. We celebrated Israel's victory in that war and we saw it as an almost God given opportunity to alleviate the dangers of that narrow middle stretch of Israel.

Only slowly has it become clear to me that Israel is in fact a creation of an European imagination, the dream of a Jewish homeland.

There is no simple right or wrong here, most significantly Israel is not more right than Hamas (not that I would EVER want to live under Hamas rule or the rule of any other fanatic organization). 

We in the west have taken somebody else's land and made them refugees in their own homeland - no wonder they are not happy and want the occupiers to go away by what ever means that is within their reach.

Taking the worst example found to date, of a soft drink containing 87.9 ppb benzene, someone drinking a 500 ml can would ingest 44 μg (micrograms) of benzene. While there is no justification for a soft drink to contain high levels of benzene (""There is a difference here between a small and unavoidable risk, and a small but avoidable risk.”[5]), the casual consumption of such a drink is unlikely to pose a significant health hazard to a particular individual (see, for example, the EPA IRIS document on benzene[6]). However, spread out over millions of people consuming soft drinks each day, there might be a small number of cancers caused by this exposure.[7]

&gt; The UK Food Standards Agency has stated that people would need to drink at least 20 litres per day of a drink containing benzene at 10 μg to equal the amount of benzene you would breathe from city air every day.[8] Daily personal exposure to benzene is determined by adding exposure from all sources.

&gt; * Air: A European study found that people breathe in 220μg of benzene every day due to general atmospheric pollution. A motorist refilling a fuel tank for three minutes would inhale a further 32μg.[9].[10] The estimated daily exposure from ""automobile-related activities"" is 49 μg and for driving for one hour is 40 μg.[8]

&gt; * Smoking: For smokers, cigarette smoking is the main source of exposure: estimates are 7900 μg per day (20-cigarette-per-day smoker),[9] 1820 μg/day, and 1800 µg/day.[8]

&gt; * Passive smoking: Benzene intake from passive smoking is estimated at 63 μg/day (Canada) and 50 µg/day.[8]

&gt; * Diet and drinking water: 0.2 – 3.1 μg/day[8]

&gt; The major cause of benzene in soft drinks is the decarboxylation of benzoic acid in the presence of ascorbic acid (vitamin C, E300) or erythorbic acid (a diastereomer of ascorbic acid, E315) **{read: NOT phosphoric acid}**. Benzoic acid is often added to drinks as a preservative in form of its salts sodium benzoate (E211), potassium benzoate (E 212), or calcium benzoate (E 213).[11] Citric acid is not thought to induce significant benzene production in combination with benzoic acid, but some evidence suggests that in the presence of ascorbic or erythorbic acid and benzoic acid, citric acid may accelerate the production of benzene.

_._
&gt; The United Kingdom's Food Standards Agency released results on March 31, 2006 for 150 beverages.[9] Its results showed 43 beverages contained benzene, four of which contained levels above the World Health Organization drinking water standards (10 ppb). These four were withdrawn from sale.[24][25]

&gt; Out of 150 soft drinks sampled, 107 (ca. 70%) did not contain detectable levels of
benzene.

http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/fsis0606.pdf

_._
&gt; The FDA released preliminary results[19] in May 2006 for 100 beverages showing that many soft drinks contained low levels of benzene (less than 5 ppb, the federal drinking water limit) while four drinks contained amounts above the standard. Two of these drinks contained amounts 15-18 times above the drinking water standard. Many of the products showed large variations in the amount benzene they contained. The FDA stated that it is working with manufacturers to reformulate products that contain benzene above the federal drinking water standard.

&gt; Over 100 soft drinks and other beverage samples were collected from retail stores in Maryland, Virginia, and Michigan. Only four beverage products containing both added benzoates and ascorbic acid contained benzene levels above the 5 ppb EPA MCL for drinking water. One cranberry juice beverage product with added ascorbic acid and only natural levels of benzoic acid (i.e., no added benzoates) also contained benzene above 5 ppb. All five products have been reformulated by the manufacturers. CFSAN tested samples of these reformulated products and found that benzene levels were less than 1 ppb.

http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/benzdata.html

_._
&gt; On 9 June 2006, Health Canada released its study results of benzene levels in beverages. Four products had levels above the Canadian guideline of five micrograms per litre for benzene in drinking water.

&gt; Health Canada's study found that in more than 80 percent of the 118 products tested, benzene was either not detected or found at levels below the lowest concentration that can be reliably measured.

The situation in economics is very much like any other human activity that is diffuse.  It's an interdependent and complex system: you have to look at all angles and triangulate if you want to get a handle on reality.  No one simplistic ideology will do the job because *all* ideologies are overly simplistic by definition - that's what makes them so appealing but also so dangerous - and just so much to the opponents.

Back in the day before the internet we had shortwave radio - if you really wanted to get a handle on the world you'd listen to as many different broadcasts as possible.  You'd listen to Radio Moscow and Voice of America (and Radio Free Europe to hear the biased crap we wouldn't even get at home).  You'd listen to Radio Havana and Radio Pyongyang because everybody *needs* to hear and be able to recognize extreme propaganda, and you can't really understand where the internal politics is coming from without actually hearing the rhetoric yourself.  I suspect its this experience that makes me recognize the same in today's MSM to trivially.

The same triangulation is required for diffuse academic subjects like economics.  You have to know what the other sides are saying even if you don't agree with them. If for no other reason, to analyze your own ideological biases and to be sure you aren't just as wrong as they.  So you need to know Austrian economics by heart.  You even need to know Marxist economics by heart.   You need to know the academic view and the practical real life reality.  You need to know 1st world capitalist reality and you need to know 3rd world poverty reality. 

If you don't, your entire opinion and source of knowledge is nothing but a house of cards.  We've seen exactly how such a house of cards can collapse because the whole construct of risk and value was such as practiced by Wall Street.  Empirical evidence gives no question about that reality, but then empirical reality is always the trump card on Platonic wishful thinking.

It's delightfully written — the human interest of the suicidal banker opening and closing the piece, and the little historical exposition with pointless info about how VW was founded by Porsche and Hitler, are straight out of The New Yorker playbook — but very misleading.

Here is the nub of what's wrong with the article:

&gt; When Volkswagen’s share price exceeded the point where it made sense for Porsche to buy the company, a number of hedge funds realized that Volkswagen shares have nowhere to go but down...So they shorted huge amounts of VW stock...waiting for the price drop they considered inevitable....Porsche anticipated exactly this situation and promptly bought up much of these borrowed VW shares that the funds were selling.

So, hedge funds believed the price was too high for Porsche to keep buying, so they went short.  But they were wrong, Porsche kept buying.  This was not a trick, they were just wrong.  

(the text I have removed is to do with how VW was ""buying up borrowed shares"" which is a misleading extra piece of technical jargon to make it sound like they did something more complex than just buying more shares)

In practice this is not what most hedge funds were doing.  More likely most hedge funds were involved in what is called a ""relative value"" trade — in the historical relationship between the VW [common stock](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=VOW%3AGR) and the non-voting [preference stock](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=VOW%3AGR).

Eventually Porsche took over VW like they wanted to all along, but because of the hedge funds distorting the market they were forced to do it in a way that ended up making them a killing in the derivatives they used to do it — or [so they claim](http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12523898).  

For me, the moral of this story is that Germany's securities and corporate laws are ridiculous and need reform.  Porsche should have had to reveal more information about their derivatives holdings.  Lower Saxony is a 20% holder in VW, distorting the price.  One of the catalysts of the Porsche event was the so-called ""[Volkswagen Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen#Relationship_with_Porsche.2C_and_the_.22Volkswagen_Law.22)"" whereby any 20% shareholder had power of veto over any takeover.  This in theory made acquisition of more than 20% of VW pointless for Porsche.  But Porsche kept accumulating it anyway anticipating the European Court of Justice would strike it down, which they did.  Then Porsche revealed what they'd been doing and the price of voting shares shot up.  These kind of events are why people refer to relative value trading as like picking up pennies in front of a bulldozer — fine so long as nothing unexpected happens, then if it is and you're looking the other way you get crushed."

Yes, it's true that care was cheaper before the 1900s, but there were also far fewer options.

Interestingly, there was a time when doctors were expected to provide free services to all hospital patients - and most hospitals were considered charities, to be run by churches.

But times and technology have changed. We've found better ways to do things.

Starting in the 1890s, Europeans began treating healthcare like a public good, rather than a charity. In the US, we shifted from charity to private good.

The result has been quality universal healthcare for most of he industrial world - while we in the US get dicked over by insurance companies.

You know you don't have a point when you have to parrot bullshit propaganda statements like that. Equating a few hundred dead of over 1,500,000  as ethnic cleansing, and all caused by HAMASs refusal to stop terror, and using civilians as human shields. You're more than  stretching. 

&gt;Ahhhh....I was wondering where your empathy and compassion were slipping to.

I've already outed you as not truly caring about the deaths of women and children. You just want to parrot the same Palestinian propaganda. You want to demonize the good side by comparing them to nazis or hitler which considering what has happened to the Jews in Europe and the middle east is as offensive as anything can get. Not surprised though, even in the US if you shove a camera in a Palestinians face they'll still say Jews need to get into an oven, and Hitler did a bad job. 
 

You make a retarded attempt to demonize a dude who's owning you in  debate by making nazi references. It's Palestinian leaders including HAMAS over and over again promising to rid the world of jews, over and over again making comments about genocide against the Jews, and making no apologies for it. Indoctrinating their children into anti Jew bigotry in  their schools and on Palestinian  childrens programing. 

HAMAS and militant islamist states mean Pogroms and genocide for Jews again, they know it, and this time they're not going to let it happen, it's that simple. 

The IDF as usual has shown great restraint in defending themselves in this latest military defensive operation. They're amazing. I can't stand religion, but I have to admit, they're doing a great job.
   
I don't agree with Zionism and I sympathize with the innocents in the region, but you are simply defending the wrong side. Militant islam is what you're trying to defend, and there's no way you'll win any kind of argument with me trying to defend militant islamists. It's all pure evil I'm amazed that anyone would try to defend it.

&gt;1967 Borders?
You can ask the audience....

Negotiations for anything aren't going to happen without an end to the military activities against Jews. HAMAS is hell bent on eliminating Jews from the entire region. You watch, they wont stop attempting to kill Jews. 

You can pick sound bites of reasonable promises and niceties out of HAMAS statements, but it's contradicted by what the bulk of their rhetoric is, which is offensive, and by their offensive actions to kill Jews from within Gaza. That's why the IDF is there now. They're doing operations against all the rockets, mortars, militarists, and their extensive infrastructure that's been being used against Jews for several months now.

Your arguments make no sense - you really don't seem to care that Sunnis and Shi'ites blow one another up by the 1000s in Iraq and kill each other's children (since you seem to care for children). That 'tier of humanity', as you put it, doesn't seem too much different than the Gazans where Fatah and Hamas kill one another and have slaughtered each other's families. I wouldn't blame any country for not assimilating that kind of madness. Egypt certainly didn't since they never annexed Gaza when they controlled it from 1949 - 1967. Yes, they also had other reasons for keeping the Gazans pawns. Mostly to keep fools like you spun up.

Your anti-semitism seems to have blinded you to the rest of the problems in the middle east. You really might want to readjust your viewpoint to be less hostile.

Oh, and read up on Srebrenica and Sarajevo. Your beloved Europeans (Serbs) killed 15,000+ Bosnian Muslims in the 1990s. I have no idea how many Serbs were killed - maybe a good paper for one of your classes.

You can't possibly hold up Europe as an example - that is so outrageous as to not even be funny. Tell me again what countries were doing atrocities in Africa over the last century? The European wars took place within your grandparent's lifetime.

As to current atrocities in Africa, the Arabs in Sudan seem to be giving the Europeans a run for their money - 100,000+ since 2003.

that was more of a joke, maybe a little dark.  i am sure like every parent those in palestine would die for their kids (unless they are gay).  but the truth is that hamas does operate within civilian centers, and those civilians willingly let them.  if i brought my kid to an army base and he got killed from friendly fire, or a terrorist attack i would be to blame (i understand the situation is to complex to be simplified in a metaphor, so i hope you see my point and not the holes in the metaphor itself).

i understand their rationale, they have no other political voices, nothing to loose and no one else to turn to.

which is exactly why we need to boycott the arab countries in the region instead of israel.  if there was freedom of speech and press and religion in the region, maybe after a generation reason would win out. 

&gt; And please don't bring religion into this, when you obviously have no clue about Islam

religion is the excuse that jews and muslims and christians use to act irrationally.  it doesn't matter what the bible or torah say's the nutcases will find passages to support whatever they want.  there are plenty of nutjobs in israel who build settlements in the middle of arab population centers, with no practical reason other then to agrivate the arabs living there.  but in israel people can tell them that they are crazy, and tell their government not to support them, and at snails pace the tide is turning against them.

Wow, I'm actually curious as to what kinds of cars these generally were?  Based on the ""a few F150s"" I will assume you're in the US or Canada -- to be honest, my experiences on American roads make me surprised that there's so many fatal crashes.  Cars (even ""normal"" family ones) tend to be bigger, speeds are generally lower, and roads are wider than here (Western Europe.)  That said, as you indicated previously, 60-70mph is still a significant speed at which to hit something, period.

Switzerland (where I'm currently working) has a problem with young men, often-but-not-always from the Balkans, Turkey or Italy, racing small cars and getting into horrific crashes.  For a while, the Zurich cops put de-gored wrecked cars at dangerous intersections and notorious racing stretches to make it look as if someone had just wiped out -- only the absence of oil or broken glass on the road was a hint that there hadn't been an accident.  Some of these were so hideously mangled that I can't imagine anyone having survived the original crash.

Remember that a lot of pick-ups/SUVs do not fall under the usually fairly stringent safety regulations applied to normal cars.  the SUV and pickup truck started as functional work vehicles; your latte-sipping dentist in his X6 has little in common with Jose the Landscaper.  

Rather, if SUV drivers here are anything to judge by, he'll be seated high above traffic, feeling invincible, speeding like a motherfucker in a powerful vehicle -- which is basically bolted together without a lot of the stringent safety testing and finely calibrated frame of a regular sedan or sports car (for the same reason that you would never re-use a motorcycle helmet after any impact, I would refuse to drive a car that's been on a jig -- something that's been bent and stretched again does not have the material strength of the original.)  Mr. dentist's perceived safety makes him a less careful driver than the guy in the (better engineered but perceptually weaker) 3-series BMW, so he's more likely to engage in stupid behavior, leading to nasty crashes.  That said, I drive an Audi TT -- if some dumbfuck in an Escalade hits me, I'd rather he be my crumple zone than the other way around.

Minor tangent, if you felt vulnerable in a Smart, have a look at the Crossblade.  I have pretty complete confidence that a regular model would be pretty safe, but in that thing I'd shit myself..."

Yes, I am in the USA, but I've driven all over the place, including Europe.

The main reason there's more American fatalities when driving is boringly simple - we drive a LOT more than other folks, especially Europe. The average American drives about 20 000 kilometers a year, compared to the 12 000 to 15 000 km a european drives. Not only that, a lot of our driving is on poorly designed and maintained roads, and then there's the matter of how we drive. 

But to your point. Here's an image (not graphic ) from a fatal wreck I worked on a few years ago between an SUV and a sedan, and a fairly typical sort of wreck. 

http://drop.io/redditcompare/asset/compare-jpg

While the damage to the SUV was extensive, the driver was totally unharmed, while the driver of the sedan was killed. The damage to the sedan actually wasn't that extensive (I've seen much worse, with survivors) but the hit from the SUV was a killing blow that could not be dissipated by the car. 

But...and this is a big qualifier - almost EVERY rollover I work is an SUV. It's almost silly - and put some snow on the ground, and they think 4 wheel drive is some magical road-grabbing technology that tuns the road and tires into a velcro pair. I drive a Jeep, with 4 wheel drive, and I've seen many of my ""sister ships"" go off the road sideways in ice and snow. 

Anyway, back to the smart car. I have a lot of respect for a well-engineered vehicle, as I mentioned before, I've seen Saabs and Subarus - and yes, the occasional US Made vehicle - demonstrate exceptional survivability in high-speed collisions. While I have concerns about surviving a wreck in a Smart Car, I actually do think that they have designed something special there and from what I can tell at a distance, it might have enough engineering in there to make a wreck a scary, but ultimately non fatal thing.

It is a good propaganda term in an age where slogans and shouting have replaced reflection and learning, but to use it in this context is to cheapen both the word itself and the appalling experiences of the Jews and Armenians, to mention but two of the major victims of this century.""[33]*

It is merely a convenient peg on which to hang a powerful weapon. ^ American Zionist Louis Marshall, counsel for Kuhn Loeb bankers in 1917


World War I broke out in the summer of 1914. Within two years, Germany had won that war... the Zionists in Germany, who represented the Zionists from Eastern Europe, went to the British War Cabinet and - I am going tobe brief because this is a long story, but I have all the documents to prove any statement that I make if anyone here is curious, or doesn't believe what I'm saying is at all possible- the Zionists in London went to the British war cabinet and they said: ""Look here. You can yet win this war. You don't have to give up. You don't have to accept the negotiated peace offered to you now by Germany. You can win this war if the United States will come in as your ally."" the United States was not in the war at that time. We were fresh; we were young; we were rich; we were powerful. they (Zionists) told England: ""We will guarantee to bring the United States into this war as your ally, to fight with you on your side, if you will promise us Palestine after you win the war. ^ Benjamin Freedman, Jewish Defector


A ""protection racket"" is a scam where an aggressor instigates an attack, blames a bogeyman, and then offers to protect the victim from this bogeyman in return for money and power. The ""War on Terror"" is the protection racket. The aggressor is the world financial elite known as the ""Crown"" based in the City of London. Their instrument is the Zionist project, specifically the Mossad and its U.S. allies. The victim is the people of the United States and the West in general. The goal is the overthrow of Western Civilization, and the establishment of a world police state called the ""New World Order."" ^ Henry Makow


We implore and beseech our Jewish brethren to realize that the Zionists are not the saviors of the Jewish People and guarantors of their safety, but rather the instigators and original cause of Jewish suffering in the Holy Land and worldwide. The idea that Zionism and the State of ""Israel"" is the protector of Jews is probably the greatest hoax ever perpetuated on the Jewish people... It has been the age-old intention of Zionism to intentionally stir up anti-semitism anywhere possible, and even more commonly, to take advantage of any Jewish suffering anywhere in order to enhance its cause. Indeed, hatred of Jews and Jewish suffering is is the oxygen of the Zionist movement, and from the very beginning has been used to deliberately incite hatred of the Jew and then, in feigned horror, used to justify the existence of the Zionist state. This is, of course, Machiavellianism raised to the highest degree. ^ Jews Against Zionism


The League of Nations is a Jewish idea. We created it after a fight of 25 years. ^ Nahum Sokolow, Zionist leader, 1922, Carlsbad Conference


Now this exactly what the Jews have done, and so have saved Europe: they have been too eager. The first clutch was the Boer War (in South Africa) which put the World's chief gold supply into their hands. The Great War was their next eager clutch. The Bolshevising of Russia followed. Then came the clutch at Hungary, under Bela Kun, which lasted 100 day, then the clutch at Bavaria, which lasted three weeks. By this time the world is beginning to awake and the fiat of the White Race has gone forth: The Jews must lose Europe, as centuries ago they lost Egypt. They are on trek to Zion once more. They are Zionists this time, as they were when they trekked out of Egypt. ^ The British Guardian of London

Come up with a deal over East Jerusalem and promise to pay compensation (which obviously EU (aka Germany) and USA would foot the bill)to Palestinain refugees who lost their homes in Israel proper. Bada bing bam baby. The situation is solved. Hell to insure future stability Israel could give pieces of the Triangle to a new Palestinian state and inact a free trade agreement between Israel,Palestine and USA/EU which would make the Palestinians to well off to care much about land just like the Germans today who lost their land in the East.

I would have signed on this right now :) (though  I didn't understand what you meant by ""the triangle"". If you are talking about the Galilee, keep in mind that Israeli arabs will never agree to give up their Israeli citizenship) 

&gt; All Israelis have to do is do a Turkey and make law that says that the only parties that can have a seat in the parliament must have atleast 10% of the national vote. 

It's not that simple. It's about 50-50 between those who are willing to compromise and those who aren't (but the number of people willing to compromise is increasing slowly: a few years ago it was a taboo to mention dividing Jerusalem, now it isn't). I think that if a peace proposal is on the table, about 60% will eventually support it. 

There will be elections in Israel in about a month. The next prime minister (if you ask me) will be Netanyahu (who is right-wing). One of his main points is that he predicted that evacuating Gaza will result in missile attacks. This is his argument against giving territory in the west bank (""they'll shoot missiles at tel aviv""). So no hope for peace with the Palestinians in the next 5 years. I do belive he will give the Golan to the Syrians though. 

It's a pretty shitty situation. Everyone knows how the peace arrangement will look like, and yet it doesn't happen. I really hope that somehow after this war the Hamas will no longer control Gaza. Ironically, event if that happens, in about a month the Israel government will be much more extreme. "

Let me stop you right there. Government-subsidised or mandated Internet is *not* Constitutional, whether it's filtered or not. There is no provision in the US Constitution whatsoever that allows the government to do this.

&gt; Should we feel comfortable relying almost exclusively on private companies to help us find the truth, when we cannot know what version of the truth they are showing us? The former president of France, Jacques Chirac, was so concerned about American hegemony over the search-engine lens that in 2005 he worked with Gerhard Schröder, then chancellor of Germany, to start a European Union search engine. The project failed. People are happy with the commercial services that search engines provide, but it is hard to think of anything else that we depend on so heavily yet know so little about.

The author seems to be suggesting that it is an unfortunate thing that this EU search engine failed, because it would have provided a more 'truthful' or open service than the commercial ventures. But just a few paragraphs back, he listed off instances of censorship on behalf of several governments, including Germany. In fact, Germany and other EU nations participate in a *lot* of censorship, both on-line and off. This is well known. I have no doubt that should such an service have been launched, it would have filtered controversial information about [National Socialism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_the_Federal_Republic_of_Germany#National_Socialist_parties), the [Holocaust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_the_Federal_Republic_of_Germany#Holocaust_denial), [politicians](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/node/5928), [violent video games](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2006/dec/12/news.germany), &amp;c. Is that preferable to the way Google ranks information? Not if you ask me.

&gt; In the United States, the Internet is still the ""most participatory form of mass speech yet developed,"" as a federal judge, Stewart R. Dalzell, wrote in overturning an early Internet-censorship law. For the Internet to remain so, more legislation will be needed to guarantee its openness.

Here's the problem with that: As soon as you let the government legislate the Internet in a 'good' way, for example by requiring search-engine openness or net neutrality, you open the door for the state to legislate it in a *bad* way. The thing about government is that it changes hands. The person you like and agree with isn't going to be in office for ever, and public opinion about censorship isn't going to remain the same for ever, and corporations aren't going to avoid lobbying for it for ever. As soon as you give the government the power to control some aspect of society, politicians become a conduit through which any pet issue -- whether it's based on religious zealotry or corporate greed -- can be furthered. This is what's happened with education, with marriage, with tariffs, with farm subsidies, with copyright laws, with petroleum.... The government is now a commodity market where officials are bought and sold by interest groups and lobbyists to implement whatever policies they want, whether it's limiting sex education in schools, or handing a monopoly to the corn industry by taxing sugar, or whatever. This can be the Internet, too."

Right, that's the huge, glaring flaw of Austrianism that makes it a religion, rather than a body of theory within a scientific field.

Economics is far from scientific *at the moment*. That doesn't mean it can't be. What we need is improved models at the micro and macro scale, not pronouncements from prophets-on-high with their tablets of Revealed Truth.

I've said this before and I'll say it again: if ultra-Libertarianism and Austrianism is so self-evidently superior as a socio-economic system, then prove it in the real world. Instead of trying to hijack everyone else, go buy an island nation (since the principles are so appealing to Capital, it should be no trouble to raise the money), and start a new country. Of course, since these economic policies are so great for both workers and owners, people should flock to enjoy this new freedom.

In contrast, fixing Darfur is impossible in the short term: there's little to no functioning state: no roads, hospitals, schools, civil society is practically non existent.

And Larry Summders was the guy who advised Russia after the break up of the Soviet Union... which led to 10 million deaths in Russia and the old Soviet Republics. His advice is to be avoided like the plague. 

&gt;In 1990, Lithuania, a restive Soviet republic seeking independence, hired Summers to advise on that country's economic transformation. Poor Lithuania had no idea what it got itself into. This was Summers's first opportunity to tackle a country in economic crisis and put his wunderkind theories into practice. The results were literally suicidal: in 1990, when Summers first arrived, Lithuania's suicide rate was 26.1 per 100,000 and falling. Just five years after Summers got his hands on Lithuania's economy, life became so unbearable under the economic transition that the suicide rate nearly doubled to 45.6 per 100,000, worse than any other ex-Soviet republic in transition. In fact, it was the highest suicide rate in the world, suggesting something particularly harsh and brutal about the economic transition in that country as opposed to the others, where suffering and pain were common. Things got so bad that in 1992, after just two years of Summers-nomics, the traumatized Lithuanians voted the communist party back into power, the first East European nation to do so--even though just a year earlier Lithuanians actually died on the streets fighting communism.

&gt;...
&gt;It was also the year that Summers, and his Harvard protégé Andrei Schleifer (who worked with Summers on the Lithuania economic transformation), began their catastrophic ""rescue"" of Russia's crisis-ridden economy. It's a complicated story involving corruption, cronyism and economic devastation. But by the end of the 1990s, Russia's GDP had collapsed by more than 60 percent, its population was suffering the worst death-to-birth ratio of any industrialized nation in the twentieth century, and the financial markets that Summers and Schleifer helped create had collapsed in what was then the world's biggest debt default ever. The result was the rise of Vladmir Putin and a national aversion to free markets and anything associated with Western liberalism.

[May 17 -- Israel this week](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/17/AR2007051700419_pf.html) allowed the Palestinian party Fatah to bring into the Gaza Strip as many as 500 fresh troops trained under a U.S.-coordinated program to counter Hamas, the radical Islamic movement that won Palestinian parliamentary elections last year. Fighting between Hamas and Fatah has left about 45 Palestinians dead since Sunday.

The forces belong to units loyal to the elected Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, a moderate Fatah leader whom the Bush administration and Israel have sought to strengthen militarily and politically. A spokeswoman for the European Union Border Assistance Mission at Rafah, where the fighters crossed into Gaza from Egypt, said their entry Tuesday was approved by Israel.

So no - we'd be looking at multiple,unbiased sources here.

&gt; The rage against the Jews that is exploding in Europe has been carefully nurtured; it is not spontaneous sympathy for fellow Muslims in Gaza. How else to explain the silence when Muslims in other conflicts, from Darfur to Chechnya, are being killed?

Yeah, because we Western Europeans stole land from the Christians and gave it to the Muslims in Chechnya. Also, a technologically vastly superior governmental army supported by the US and other western countries has turned a tiny strip of land in Sudan into a economically unviable city, a getto/virtual concentration camp.

Also the P7 is truly ambidextrous...

The bad part is that the P7 floats in and out of being discontinued.  So they tend to cost $1300 to $1600.  Just make sure you buy the one with the mag release in the customary position by the trigger.  The European version has the mag release at the base of the stock.  Not good.

Those numbers seem odd...we know that over at least the last two decades Israel has been able to inflict many times the casualties it suffers - whether in retaliation or not - because it is massively more powerful than its enemies in that period.

Had a very quick trawl of stats, checking figures for the 1948, 1956, 1967, and 1973 wars only - because wars generate deaths at a much greater rate than any other time.

Couldn't find any figures for 1956 at all, but suggest that figures for that war were minimal Israeli deaths and Egypt more - but not huge compared to the other wars.

So the following figures exclude 1956.

Very precise figures for Israel - 10,308. Figures for Arabs were less precise, but are in the range 38,500 - 50,000 depending on whether you take the lower or upper figures for each war.

So in all the other low-level military actions and terrorist events he is suggesting that another 12,000 Israelis have died. It just doesn't seem likely, but no doubt someone can point to figures. My own guess in the absence of other data would be &lt; 1,500 - but it is no more than an educated guess.

I think it fair to say that the multiple Israeli actions in Lebanon and Gaza have accounted for a sizeable number of Arab deaths. 

The numbers are relatively easy to check (except 1956!). And I think the article's numbers are very flawed. Very sloppy.

Why am I posting? Well, it strikes me that Mr. Heinsohn, who
&gt;heads the Raphael Lemkin Institute at the University of Bremen, Europe's first institute devoted to comparative genocide research

is pretty slapdash with his figures. And that is a pile of crock.

Edit: my estimate of 1500 looks somewhat low and the (approximate) actual figure is 2500."

&gt;Travel into Gaza from Egypt via Rafah is restricted to Palestinians registered in the Israeli-controlled Palestinian population registry. Therefore, foreigners may enter Gaza only via Israeli-controlled crossings in the north.

&gt;Israel also exercises ultimate control over the entrance into and exit from Gaza of all persons, including Palestinian ID card holders, and has used that control periodically to close Gaza to the outside world. Israeli consent and cooperation are required for Rafah Crossing to open, because the agreement for opening the crossing requires the participation of Israeli, Palestinian, and European Union officials. Israel also controls whether EU monitors will reach Rafah by issuing security warnings, telling the EU monitors whether Rafah may open. Reports and internal military documents suggest that Israel has used the closure of the crossing to exercise pressure on Gaza residents, in order to bring about the return of the Israeli soldier captured on June 25, 2006. Indeed, in the first year following the completion of its disengagement program, Israel kept Rafah Crossing closed for 148 days, meaning that Gaza was cut off from the outside world 42% of the time."

Disclaimer, this was an internal tool, not related to anything even remotely important. It didn't go through the usual review process or anything, it was just this guy's spare time project.

A bit of a background, for historical reasons, all of our servers are set up to be in a same timezone, even though we have them both in Europe and in the US. Which sounds reasonable, except for the fact that the timezone is not GMT, it's, let's say, RDT (Really Dumb Time). RDT observes daylight saving time, which is the source of innumerable bugs every half a hear.

Now the story. This particular piece of code collects event times expressed as unix time (seconds since epoch) and writes them into a mysql database: 'INSERT ... (FROM_UNIXTIME(%s), ...)'.

Now by some strange quirk of fate, the mysql server timezone is not RDT, it's GMT (not sure why -- I would guess that our mysql gurus recognized that using RDT was a dumb idea). So, if you just do 'SELECT timecolumn FROM BlahTable', you get back the time reported as GMT.

How does our hero solve this? Of course, he subtracts the time difference in seconds between GMR and RDT from the timestamp before inserting it into the database. The smart reader already guessed that this would not work very well, for one because the difference is variable due to daylight saving time. But the real WTF is that you should never assume anything about the local or remote time zone -- otherwise, if either the server or the collector move to a different time zone, the whole thing would spectacularly collapse.

The third piece of the puzzle is the PHP ui, which does 'SELECT timecolumn' and then does strptime to convert it to number of seconds to compute the time difference (like '1 day ago'), then it does strftime again to display it as time, and finally it uses substr to convert YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS to YYYYMMDD. It is left as an exercise to the reader to determine what timezone the UI should be running in. :).

Now all this WTF can be avoided by (a) not subtracting anything in the collection code and (b) using UNIX_TIMESTAMP(timecolumn) and (c) using timestamp values everywhere and only calling strftime when the time has to be displayed.

So hopefully you could learn from this story, and never make this mistake in your code."

As climate change occurs that could change, but overall, even vs climate change North America is superior to Europe and Asia for food and much more temperate than Europe would be if ocean and air currents continue to change. 

In the long, if I had to think about flooding, food shortages, drought, and all the land wars connected to those things... clearly North American is the place to be.

It's not as if the world can get by easily without Americas enormous food output. In the end we have the resource that trumps even oil, the best agricultural lands in the world, probably by far and setting smack on top a huge aquafilter. It could hardly be setup any better. 

Personally I'm not worried at all. If the world goes to shit America will still be the top place to be. I'm not saying there won't be other decent places to live, but war could devour Asia at any random time as it has so many times in the past.

You just can't achieve that type of easy invasion against the US. Our position is superior to that of even Rome because we are the empire, with the military, but we are buffered by the oceans, Canada and Mexico. 

It's an easy land to defend, though large the few amount of neighboring nations and the oceans keep America safer during most disasters. 

That's the real reason America is even on top. We have the best nation, 2nd perhaps to Russia, who's land is enormous and resource rich, but not temperate enough and prone to disasterous climate shift possibilities. 

I think North and South America are the ideas continents to control. We should make better friends with South America. Climate change is coming and it's hard to imagine there won't be more wars in Asia as a result. Even if it's only food shortages, in these asian nations will billion people populations it's going to be insanity as food demand can no longer be met because of unstable weather conditions. Rising energy and unsustainable farming practices don't help much either. BUT, the KEY is having the plushest land. Britan made the biggest blunder in history letting the colonies become independent, as least from their perspective of self perpetuation. 

England's land is cold and harsh compared to North America which is diverse and fairly amazingly plush. I mean, we still have Canada up there with all that land and only 30 mill people. Mexico only has 100 million people.

That's 430 million people to a pretty big continent. It's a good life compared to what most regions can offer. When times get tough these high population nations are going to suffer enormous instability.

Even an author who decries the legacy of colonialism is realistic in stating

&gt;Clayton suggested that in the pre-colonial period Africa had been covered by literally thousands of polities without clearly demarcated formal boundaries and of varying degrees of organization. The young men of these polities were warriors or ""frontiersmen."" They allied, fragmented, and formed again in changing patterns and freely crossed frontiers. They engaged in continuous local scrapping over the perceived assets: land, cattle, and women. They lived to fight and fought to live.

&gt;Stripped of its rhetoric, Clayton continued, most of the warfare in post-independence Africa in the second half of this century bears a strong resemblance to warfare of the pre-colonial period. The weapons may have changed, but not the fluidity of political structures nor the kinds of things Africans are fighting for. Even the importance of the ""Big Man"" is an echo of the past.

I did look into a lot what makes some countries work much better than others, and it seems it's indeed trust or or voluntary cooperation or plain simply morals which form the basis of trust. (The No. 1 condition of trusting the other guy to not rob you blind is that it should actually rarely happen i.e. people having high morals.) With low levels of trust one must take so many precautions that a lot of things just cannot be done. Unlike you, I have a lot of trust in free markets, but define them differently. They aren't really about competition, but about cooperation between vendor and customer. Now the way I see it  if you have 100 ""units"" of resources (money, time, attention) with low levels of trust both parties spend 60 units on protecting their asses from each other and only 40 units on productive cooperation. But if they have high levels of trust, they can spend 10 units on precautions and 90 units of productive cooperation. 

In my personal experience, the reason the UK produces more wealth and higher salaries than Hungary or Poland is that people have to spend very little effort on trying to protect their asses from each other. In the UK people don't debate 3 weeks about a contract for a work that takes 2 weeks. In Eastern Europe they often do which is a huge loss of productivity. Simply the amount of energy put into getting shit done vs. the amount of energy you have to put into forcing the customer to pay the bill after you got shit done is the primary reason for differences in productivity.

Or one may call it  social capital. http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/seminar/1999/reforms/fukuyama.htm

Actually, by even Reddit's accounts, it's about 400 civilians dead, and the rest were Hamas.

&gt; 1.5 million people in a walled off land being collectively punished

They're walled off because they kept infiltrating Israel with suicide bombers over the past 40 years. It was either a big wall or a big minefield.

&gt; invaded, 

Israel pulled out in 2005, Hamas used that to launch rockets at Israel.

&gt; the psychological toll on all

Also because Hamas is not really helping with children's TV shows teaching children to become suicide bombers (Search youtube).

&gt; deprived of food, fuel, freedom of movement

Mostly because of the corrupt governments the Palestinians have had to deal with all these years - Yasser Arafat, for example, kept his wife with enough money to live 6 lifetimes while the Palestinians starved. Hamas takes foreign aid money to buy weapons... If more, or any, of that foreign aid money through the years would have made it to the citizens of the Palestinian territories, things would be looking a lot different.

&gt; the alienation of a democratically elected party

One that calls for the destruction of Israel, no country *should* accept a neighboring government that calls for its destruction.

&gt; but who did keep and marshal a ceasefire

When rockets are fired at Israel, one can safely assume Hamas was involved in it. If, after further investigation, it turned out that Hamas wasn't responsible, well... everyone has 20/20 hindsight. I'll remind you that an average of 11 rockets per month were fired at Israel from Gaza during the ceasefire, which is more than the acceptable 0 rockets per month.

Also, Hamas dug tunnels in attempt to kidnap Israeli soldiers, and armed itself with rockets with longer range than they ever had before.



I agree with you that the best solution would be for all sides to renounce violence. The problem is that there isn't any trust between the two peoples because for the past 100 years we've been murdering eachother senseless. Also, using religion (Jihad, holy war) to call for all Muslims to fight against Israel doesn't give me, as an Israeli, any confidence that lowering our weapons would cause them to stop. Same as the 2005 pullout, where Israel withdrew and got a sharp stick up its ass in return.

Maybe, with the help of an international force who can guarantee absolute peace in the area, over the years we could rebuild that trust... but even then we're talking about decades.

&gt; but that does not mean that similar parallels cannot be made i.e. the Warsaw Ghetto.

Warsaw ghetto is not similar in the slightest to Gaza. Jews were rounded up and moved to ghettos, where they were forced into labor and killed in the most horrific ways - sometimes from being used as lab rats for medical experiments.

The only thing that's similar between Warsaw and Gaza is the crowded environment.

&gt; So what's that, an argument against equality and/or enforced birth control/genocide?

No, this is an argument against being too ""politically correct"" for your own good, which is what Europe is."

There is ample evidence that Stalin was [planning to invade Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa#The_Soviet_offensive_plans_theory).  For example, there was a massive Soviet army on the border, all with maps of Europe but none of the Soviet Union.

Also the Soviets had been working in their weapons factory 7 days a week 2x12 hour shift since 1939, obviously in preparation for something big.

With this in perspective it is not clear whether  Barbarossa was a mistake or not.  There might have no way for Germany to avoid a conflict with the Soviet Union.

Higher on the list of mistakes I owuld say are:

* Delaying the German advance at Dunkirk
* Canceling Operation Sealion (the invasion of Great Britain)
* Declaring war on the United States.  (Make war with a country he could not attack.  WTF was he thinking).  Perhaps the biggest mistake in a war where air power was key was making war with a country that had a capacity of building 100,000 planes a year.

If you are talking about 'the number of characters in existence', then of course Chinese wins hands down by a factor of more than ten or so.

This is not true of Chinese, sorry.  I'm not sure it's true of Japanese, either, but my knowledge of Japanese is limited to taking it as a foreign language in school.  Reading a Chinese newspaper requires a lot more than 2500 characters.  Frankly I doubt you could reliably read a middle school text with that many.

The thing to remember is that the Japanese ""spell"" a lot of their words using phonetic syllabaries.  The Chinese do not have such a system, and so everything in the language must be written with Chinese characters.

Westerners are often told that with 4000 or so characters, you know 90% what you're likely to see.  This is probably true, but what they don't tell you is that the remaining 10% is very sparsely distributed -- getting to the point that you recognize 99% of all characters means adding on another 3 to 4000 characters or so.  Since 10% of a text is still 1 in 10 characters, you're going to find a text quite difficult to make out without knowing far more.

Obviously it depends on what you're reading, and this is true in Japanese too, I think.  An entertainment magazine will be much easier to make out than a medical journal, obviously.  But when the Japanese encounter a rarely used word, they usually fall back on kana to write it, not just because they themselves forget the character, but also because they are unsure their readership will recognize it.  Chinese is the same, except that there's no syllabary to fall back on.  In fact, if I recall correctly, the Japanese government publishes a list of some 3000 characters that an adult needs to be considered literate, and either by law or convention any characters used in newspapers that are not in that list have furigana next to them.  If that is in fact true (I wouldn't stand by it), then in Japan you may really only need a few thousand characters to read a newspaper.

Let me say though that because Chinese characters were designed for Chinese, not Japanese, they are particuarly poor fit for the language.  To use a European analogy, Chinese was the ""latin"" of Asia in medieval times -- the language of the elite, and almost all texts in East Asia were authored in it.  The Japanese -- like the Koreans and the Vietnamese -- attempted at this time to write their own languages, which had no writing system, using Chinese characters.  The Vietnamese and the Koreans realized much earlier on that this was a fundamentally unworkable solution.  The Japanese did not.

The result is that whereas in Chinese, a character will typically have one or two readings, common characters in Japanese can have as many as fifteen completely different readings.  Take 中, for example.  This character just means center.  It is used in Chinese to write the name of China, 中国, and is also used to say that something is in the middle of something else.  These two uses of the character in Chinese are pronounced the same way.  But in Japanese, which has a very different grammar, they are completely different.  In order to shoehorn the system onto Japanese, they needed to give the same character completely different readings (*chu* and *naka*, if memory serves).  One could therefore argue that the overhead of learning 2000 characters in Japanese is much greater than learning 6000 in Chinese.  Again, I don't know, because I don't speak Japanese.

&gt;Well if you've been exposed to both, you might know that the difference is that Chinese prefer their standard font to be one with serifs on their strokes. Japanese on the other hand have standard fonts without serifs (sans-serif) which is mislabeled 'Gothic'. I could imagine that going from a plain font to a serif font is trickier to get used to than the other way around.

I hate to say this, but my impression is that you don't read either Chinese or Japanese.  There are tons of different fonts, serif and no, on both sides of the fence.  The primary difference is one of proportion -- the Japanese give ""weight"" to different parts of characters, giving them a slightly different balance.  This is probably so that they look better in a text with lots of kana, I don't know -- as a Chinese speaker I find them ugly, but that's subjective, and I'm sure they feel the same way about us.  The Japanese also simplified some of their characters differently from the mainland Chinese, and adopted as standard some forms that are less standard (but generally still recognized) in the greater China area."

One consequence of overall global warming, in theory, is the slowing and shutting down of ocean currents which are driven by cold, salty water sinking. If the water doesn't get cold enough, or is less salty due to polar ice melting, it won't sink as quickly or at all, hence the slow or shut down of global currents. Of course, if this were to happen (and some argue it already is), it would stop currents like the gulf stream from warming areas like Europe, leading to a much colder, harsher climate there and warmer climates in the tropics. So even if there's ""global warming"" some areas aren't going to end up warmer - they'll end up cooler, which is probably why ""climate change"" is more appropriate. "

Also many of the people in government are Zionists and Freemasons. Freemasons support Israel because the whole foundation of freemasonry is the plan to rebuild Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem to fulfil biblical prophecy. Zionists also want the Temple to be rebuilt for this reason.

""The Temple Mount in Jerusalem is the holiest site in Judaism. Jewish Midrash holds that it was from here that the world expanded into its present form, and that this was where God gathered the dust he used to create the first man, Adam. The Torah records that it was here that God chose to rest his Divine Presence, and consequently two Jewish Temples were built at the site. According to Jewish tradition, the Third Temple will also be located here, and will be the final one.""


Infact freemasonry has controlled Zionism and Israel from the beginning. I think [this](http://www.freemasonrywatch.org/pics/borninblood.jpg) and [this](http://www.illuminati-news.com/graphics/knights-templar=freemasonry.jpg) make it abundantly clear.

So why can't they simply rebuild this Temple you ask? Because it's currently occupied by the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock, which are both very important to Muslims. ""In Islam, the site is revered as the destination of Islamic prophet Muhammad's journey to Jerusalem, and the location of his ascent to heaven, and is also associated with other local Muslim figures of antiquity."" 


These would have to be destroyed for Solomon's Temple to be rebuilt and if that was to happen it would start a whole shit-storm. Ofcourse it will happen though. These people ALWAYS get there way.

Albert Pike who is said to be the founder of modern Freemasonary and was the Grand Commander of North American Freemasonry from 1859-1891 is said to have written a letter to Giuseppe Mazzini (although it can't be confirmed) that is dated August 15 1871 and outlined three world wars that were to be created and this is what it said:



""The First World War must be brought about in order to permit the Illuminati to overthrow the power of the Czars in Russia and of making that country a fortress of atheistic Communism. The divergences caused by the ""agentur"" (agents) of the Illuminati between the British and Germanic Empires will be used to foment this war. At the end of the war, Communism will be built and used in order to destroy the other governments and in order to weaken the religions.""

Students of history will recognize that the political alliances of England on one side and Germany on the other, forged between 1871 and 1898 by Otto von Bismarck, co-conspirator of Albert Pike, were instrumental in bringing about the First World War.

""The Second World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences between the Fascists and the political Zionists. This war must be brought about so that Nazism is destroyed and that the political Zionism be strong enough to institute a sovereign state of Israel in Palestine. During the Second World War, International Communism must become strong enough in order to balance Christendom, which would be then restrained and held in check until the time when we would need it for the final social cataclysm.""

After this Second World War, Communism was made strong enough to begin taking over weaker governments. In 1945, at the Potsdam Conference between Truman, Churchill, and Stalin, a large portion of Europe was simply handed over to Russia, and on the other side of the world, the aftermath of the war with Japan helped to sweep the tide of Communism into China.  

(Readers who argue that the terms Nazism and Zionism were not known in 1871 should remember that the Illuminati invented both these movements.  In addition, Communism as an ideology, and as a coined phrase, originates in France during the Revolution.  In 1785, Restif coined the phrase four years before revolution broke out.  Restif and Babeuf, in turn, were influenced by Rousseau - as was the most famous conspirator of them all, Adam Weishaupt.)

""The Third World War must be fomented by taking advantage of the differences caused by the ""agentur"" of the ""Illuminati"" between the political Zionists and the leaders of Islamic World. The war must be conducted in such a way that Islam (the Moslem Arabic World) and political Zionism (the State of Israel) mutually destroy each other. Meanwhile the other nations, once more divided on this issue will be constrained to fight to the point of complete physical, moral, spiritual and economical exhaustion…We shall unleash the Nihilists and the atheists, and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism, origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil. Then everywhere, the citizens, obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries, will exterminate those destroyers of civilization, and the multitude, disillusioned with Christianity, whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction, anxious for an ideal, but without knowing where to render its adoration, will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer, brought finally out in the public view. This manifestation will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism, both conquered and exterminated at the same time.""

Whether this letter is true or not my personal belief is that the current events are leading up to the third world war described above.

Yes it did. Look at Mozambique or Angola. All the major urban centres were created during colonialism. 

For Mozambique:

&gt; However, the period between the 1920s and the independence in 1975, was marked by a gradual promotion of several economic and social developments in the Portugal-administered territory, which included a great expansion of commercial, industrial, agricultural, educational, transport, and health care infrastructure, that generated notable growth rates in the entire territory.


&gt; The largest legacies left to India from the British Raj were the widespread use of English and the roots from which a vibrant democracy has grown. 

As I said – literacy. Remember that India (and for example China) had a written word. In Sub-Sahara Africa there was no written word of any kind. The simple addition of written word (in any language) was a huge accomplishment in Africa.

&gt; And yet the scale of bloodshed that took place under colonial rule made all prior wars look rather tame. Again, India can be used as a demonstration of the monstrous disregard for indiginous life displayed by the colonial masters.

Not over all of the place. Look at South Africa - the Zulus was busy with the Mfecane (basically a genocide of all other tribes in Southern Africa). That was stopped. 

Look at Zimbabwe - there were constant wars between the Shona (and the Matabele who displaced the Shona). The British put a stop to that. 

&gt; This is starkly different from the Roman Empire, in which the provinces grew to compete successfully with the Italian core of the Empire. 

Do you think that the Roman Empire didn't do anything without self-interest? The Roman Empire was just as exploitative as colonialism. 

&gt; You seem to have a pretty rosy view of what is one of the West's greatest historical shames. I wonder how that came to be.

I compared colonialism to the Roman Empire. You have a pretty positive view about the Roman Empire. Have you ever read up how violent they were.

No one have found a place for long term storage of spent nuclear fuel, so the cost estimate of this is just a guess, and varies with several orders of magnitude depending whether those you ask are for or against nuclear power. 

Nuclear power projects has also nearly always been over time and budget, with almost no exceptions. The average cost overrun for all nuclear reactors over the years is 207 percent. Thus there is reasons to doubt the figures. Based on their price estimate, the environmental cost of coal is not included either. Based on this, the cost of renewable may look more favourable. 

I would actually guess that this is a document that is made to show the case for nuclear. Coal is not acceptable in Sweden, and there is shortage of gas in Europe (which is the background for the Russia/Ukraine conflict), and this will worsen as British gas fields deplete. There is also little hydro that remains to be developed. Thus this is a way for a nuclear power operator to tell that nuclear is better than wind power, which is otherwise impossible to say in Swedish politics.

You see how close to your positions I inhabit, but I have to say, at some point in some manner Israel not responsible for all of the anti-Semitism in the world, and the exploitation of it on the part of demagogues.  I defend the rights of Palestinians as a human being, and in full recognition of their oppression at the hands of Israel, and especially because of it, but just as the Bill of Rights didn't extend to slaves or women, and has been trounced periodically by the U.S. government, by law enforcement turning a blind eye to lynching and the mistreatment of undocumented workers, Native Americans, all manner of minorities, victims of domestic abuse, etc., I just can't envision a Middle East without ardent factions, and one will likely be Zionist Jews who think their mission is to defend all Jews, and who have been called upon periodically to do so.  In a world in which genocides and civil wars and the oppression of minorities exist, they won't be talked out of thinking they have such a commitment to their people.  I don't want to demonize them for that thinking, nor Palestinians for their nationalism and commitment to their people(s).  I do want to demonize the bigotry on both sides, but to reiterate a point I made previously, and I apologize for belaboring it, I don't see demonizing Zionism as a solution (though certainly NOT funding its militarism is a major step toward one).  

My experience of people from former Communist countries is exactly what you suggest, but while people of socialist Western European countries have plenty to complain about, many Marxist ideas, such as government control of some industries like railways and power, health care, welfare, needn't be dictatorial in the Soviet/China models.  Censoring and state control of information, absolute monopolies on governing authority, etc., are not required to effect some communist methods toward some goals of economic security and equality, nor is dictatorship a necessary condition of nationalizing industries.  As Communism as an economic/political method has fallen, Russia wends its way back to dictatorship, and China has never relinquished it, even as private enterprise becomes the modus of those dictatorships.  

I've lived my entire life with Israel as a fait accompli, but it wasn't that long ago that there really was no entity that put itself as a defender of Jews, and the history of that in some places (like the U.S.) was marvelous, and in others (like Czarist and later Soviet Russia, or Ethiopia) sucked.  

I've heard my whole life some liberals praise in one form or another what's come to be called diversity or multiculturalism, and some conservatives insist in the U.S. that there should not be Hispanic Americans, black Americans, Muslim Americans, there should just be Americans.  I always thought that was a bad recipe for lousy ethnic food and discrimination.  America has benefited by the existence of the NAACP and even the Black Panthers.  Palestinians benefit from the PLO.  What needs to happen is not the abolition of Zionism, but a structure under which militant Zionism is not permitted to be destructive of Palestinians, nor the PLO of Jews.  

Obviously easy to say, and in the current situation, it may sound absurd.

Instead of focusing on answering the anti-zionism&lt;&gt;anti-semitism meme, we have to bludgeon them with the proper definition of Zionism given its historical context and actual aims.

Zionism is a nation building activity started over 100 years ago with the aim of building a nation of jews preferably within the full borders of Greater Israel. Building a mono-cultural nation on the land of others smells like fascism. Fascism had its moment of notoriety in Europe between 1920-1945, with a sputtering existence in Spain till 1975 and a few scandals in Greece and Italy. The USA cultivated fascist movements in South America to rob the indigenous people of their rights in the latter half of the last century!

1.  There's no warm and fuzzy in accepting a multicultural, multi-ethnic world.  It's damned hard to acknowledge both human similarity and cultural differences, and to acknowledge conflict and work through it.  That's not a warm and fuzzy.  Denying difference, pretending to ignore it, does a hell of a lot more to suppress and subvert than open acknowledgment and actively looking for common ground, than merely to pretend that ignoring difference just miraculously exposes common ground.  There are parties, traditions of interpretation, competing needs and claims that any society, any country has, and a careful examination of them, of the rights of individuals, of groups, of polities, is an ever demanding exercise.  We're just about to shuck an administration in the U.S. that ignored its obligation to consult its coequal branch of elected representatives in Congress, and good riddance to them.  Democracy is a hell of a lot more demanding than a decider sitting on his ass deciding and snapping his fingers, and that means consultation with the people who are affected by decisions.  

No, Communist is the spin the U.S. put on whoever we disagreed with during the Cold War.  Dictatorships rule by point of gun, control (or try to) information by suppression and propaganda, by jailing political opponents, etc.  Pinochet was a dictator, but favorable to U.S. commercial interests, but his democratically elected predecessor Allende was not.  Putin has been pushing post-Soviet Russia toward the dictatorship his country enjoyed under Communist and Czarist rule before him, jailing or outlawing his political opponents, using the military and courts to confiscate the wealth of his opponents, etc.  It's not some bullshit western propaganda to see the familiar chill of dissent drop over Russia out of the chaos of the fall of Communism.  Some of the former Communist countries and Soviet republics are attempting to have real democratic reform, others are subject to charismatic demagogues, and some are flat out dictatorships.  In the West, individuals can start their own low-budget news outlets on-line, and expose political corruption, as Josh Marshall did with Talking Points Memo who broke and persisted publicizing the stories of the corrupt use the Bush administration made of the Justice Department, and sleazeballs like ""Duke"" Cunningham.  Or in the west, individuals can flood the web with pornography, or white supremest bullshit.  Not so in China where even Google and Yahoo! are censored.  

The Cold War and the so-called War on Terror has had a chilling effect on public discourse, but it didn't stop it, and the screaming of the minority over the erosion of individual liberties abused by the current administration has dimmed the possibility that such brutal tactics as this administration has used will be extended or diminished.  No, no, we have our problems, but what made the Communist countries horrible wasn't that the government owned the railroads instead of private enterprise, it was that they suppressed dissent with a brutal fist.  

No, the Jews aren't merely a religious group, you are correct.  Most of the leaders of Israel, the reasonable ones and the demagogues, the peaceniks and the warmongers, aren't any more religious than Rumsfeld or McCain or Kennedy.  But the Jews are a people, with a common cultural ancestry that includes its ancient history and traditions and its modern history of diaspora, as well as the in-gathering of Israel.  Neither are the Jews monolithic.  

What difference does it make that elected leaders of Israel are religious or not?  The crucial difference between them and House of Saud is that for better or worse, one is elected and the other isn't, that one is subject to its laws, and the other is the law.  What's amazing about the Saudis is that, as closed and repressive as they have been, they have kept Mecca open to all Muslims.  And what's amazing and painful about the government of Israel is that although it is painfully democratic and its media open, it subjects Palestinians to a brutal regime of control and humiliation.  

Even if there were as you say, one country with equal rights, there will be factions that will include Jew-hating Arabs and Arab-hating Jews.  They will include lefty peacenik Jews and moderate Arabs.  They will include various Arab Christians, Orthodox Jews, and the various secular.  

I don't see how they turn themselves into one country, and I don't see a Briton or Ottoman or U.S. imposing one.  Maybe they can do it, but I don't see how they ever would.  It would be absolutely fine with me if they did.  

But given a two thousand year history of powerless Jewish communities suffering expulsions, pogroms, restrictions, ghettoization, extra taxes, military drafts, etc., at the hands of polities of Christians and Muslims, I doubt you'll convince Jewish nationalists, whether they're Zionists or not, that the world doesn't need a defender of Jews.  

Building a ""model society"" will eliminate racial conflicts?  The end of anti-Semitism?  Recall for a moment that Germany was the most modern, liberal, tolerant country in the world, with its Jews fully integrated in its society, in its schools, military, government, businesses, neighborhoods.  You're telling me that ""Next time"" I may see anti-Semitism ""far more violent than before""?  I'd say that given that the majority of the Jews of Europe, which had been largest population of Jews in the world, was overwhelmingly eradicated by a secular, modern government, I would be surprised if the next Holocaust were much more vehement or efficient than the lsst one.  

It's envisioning that, by the way, that leads otherwise rational people to support the unsustainable militarism of Israel, not the other way around.  There wasn't an Israel oppressing Palestinians to provoke the last one, and neither does there need to be one to provoke the next one.  And just as an aside, the Jews of Israel who lived in Damascus, Beirut, Baghdad, etc., are as strident as any about controlling the Palestinians as any, and I'm told they are so because all the peaceful generations of living side by side with Arabs who hated and oppressed them.  I doubt that's hyperbole, but I don't know.  

As far as an analogous situation with homosexuals, homosexuals as an oppressed minority, as well as women as an oppressed group, are born into every society everywhere.  Just as there should be attempts to enlighten all societies about their rights, there should also be groups that defend their rights wherever they are.  If necessary, there should be militias.  It's been a century and half since the Emancipation Proclamation, and two generations since the voting rights act.  Is this society free of racial conflict?  

Since you're calling for one country, would you be willing to accept that for the whole world?  A single country would eliminate a lot of wars and conflict.  Would you willingly cede sovereignty to an elective body under which everybody had equal rights?  In the age of instant communication, purple thumb prints, and long established (in some places) democratic institutions, would you accept a world federation in which you shared a government with Libya and Italy and China, with the people of Tblisi and Vilnius and St. Petersburg and Nairobi?  Where delegates are apportioned equally based on geography and population?  Or maybe just a North American version, where delegates from Saskatoon and Oaxaca sit side by side with those from Montana and Kentucky?  Where delegates from Montreal and Vera Cruz decide policy with those from Fairbanks and Phoenix?  We already have NAFTA, why not the United States of North America?  We wouldn't have an illegal immigrant problem from Mexico if Mexico were but one region of a single polity.

I define a ""perfectly"" free market as:
An economic system in which all exchanges of property are voluntary.
Now nothing's perfect in this world, and to again avoid the ""no true Scotsman"" issue I propose looking at the failures of a free market system in real world examples that come the closest to a free market system (i.e the least amount of non-voluntary exchanges of property).

Taking this set of rules (which I consider reasonable but you may object to), we can look at the relatively impressive success of countries with limited resources compared to their developed counterparts.  The developing US (1830-1900) is an early example in which a relatively backward country (compared to europe) was able to utilize a system of free exchange (again relatively speaking) to enhance the overall amount of wealth that belonged to the citizens.

Great Britain from 1800-1830 is another example.  At the time their parliament was dominated by free market thinkers that were riding off the ideas of the enlightenment and authors such as adam smith.  This allowed England to become one of the first industrialized nations on earth.

These examples can go on literally forever.  Jamestown is a micro example, as well as most of the early American colonies.  Later in history you get the development of west Germany's free economy in comparison to east Germany's not so free economy.  Then you have the example of the eastern Asian markets beginning with Japan.  Now you have places such as Singapore, China (utilizing economic free zones), Hong Kong, and sections of India that are all following this model of developing nations.  The next place will probably be Africa, and the process has begun already to some extent.

The fact is, by trial pure historical evidence we can see that countries that encourage free and voluntary trade instead of involuntary trade (taxes, and regulations) grow faster.  All of these countries had different circumstances for their growth, and the one common trait they share is the free market attitude of voluntary exchange.  You have giant resource havens such as the US, and you have relatively resource poor places such as Hong Kong or Switzerland that ALL benefit from voluntary exchange.


This is what you guys were arguing about originally when john said something about capitalism making poor groups freer or richer.  If you are talking about how to distribute resources in a developed country such as the US today then yes you are going to run into a lot of problems.  I would still argue that the best system would be the closest to a free market system of voluntary exchange, but thats an argument for another time."

The conflict today is intimately entangled with the modern history of Europe.  The modern state of Israel exists because of European persecution of Jews and European colonialism and European wars.

In the past, natural phenomena were explained by the creation of various mythologies. The ancient Egyptians realized the importance of the Sun to their existence, but they didn't understand what it was or how it moved as it did. Thus, they decided that Ra floated in a sun boat in the sky during the day, which by night guarded him against the clawing savages of Duat. As science advanced, so did our understanding of the night and day, and the seasons. As early as the 4th century BC the idea of heliocentrism had gained traction among Greek astronomers, and by medieval times it was accepted fact among scientists from Western Europe to the Middle East.

This is a common pattern in all fields of science. It is also not applicable to this discussion - because no evidence has ever been supplied in support of any hypothesis regarding the ultimate origin of the universe. Mythologies are born because people need explanations for the things they do not understand, and they die because they are empirically disproved. At this point, any atheistic prescription of cosmic origin is every bit as much a creation myth as any of those supplied by the various dogmas of the world.

“For a thousand years and more / We have had an understanding / You allow me to breathe / I accept your crazy raging // Sometimes, when the days get darker / Strange moods come upon you / Till you decorate your claws / With the lifeblood from my veins // Now our friendship is firmer / Getting stronger by the day / Since the raging started in me / Daily more and more like you.”

I very much prefer having a foreigner address me in English directly and politely rather than have him try and repeat phrase-book stuff while he giggles thinking he's doing something incredibly exotic.

Truth is, nobody (with the possible exception of the French) cares if you don't speak the local language and try and communicate in English – as long as you do so politely and showing respect."

I really prefer to ""travel"" like that. I've done 6 months in Canada (which I guess is slightly more of a big deal if you're from Europe, as I am) a month in Bulgaria, and several weeks in France, over a couple of trips (I think a month was the longer trip; I hitch-hiked from Calais to Provence (in about 50 hours) the second time).

I find actual intense travelling a little stressful. It can be scary, isolating yourself and being all anonymous and losing yourself, and that is good because it's pushing yourself &amp; your boundaries a little. I do find that very fulfilling, but I guess I find it a little mentally draining, too, and I find it difficult keep up moving constantly from place to place, especially with uncertain destinations, for long.

As a person I guess I like to have somewhere ""safe"" nearby. That is something  that people are often trying to shed when they travel, but it's not necessary to get back into a rut - I just like to have somewhere (like the hostel's garden) where I can chill out with a book and switch my mind off and relax and not have any pressures on me.

I think that if you travel spend a few weeks in a place &amp; hang out with the locals you get a far better idea of the culture of a place. You get to know a city or a country and just get a ""feel"" for it. I really value the time I spent in France because I was able to exercise - and significantly expand on - my schoolboy French, and was able to have whole conversations without resorting to any English.

I would say, however, that a ""goal"" or reason for being in a country is important. All the trips I mention above I was paragliding, and so I mingled with local pilots and was often warmly welcomed &amp; taken care of by local pilots. When I subsequently spent 3 weeks in the Ukraine, it was much less memorable - I hung out in the cafes in Odessa and went out at night, and felt that the whole trip was little more than a beach holiday, however ""exotic"" the destination."

As far as I have understood from the article you linked to, they were Israelis (of that national identity) and had only been in Denmark for a week.

In this case I was referring to harassment of Danish Jews in general, as exemplified by the Jew who was interviewed in Aftenshowet.

&gt;Finally, you touch upon something which makes this whole situation very difficult from a personal level of someone who is affected by whats going on. Are Israelis jews? Are jews Israelis? Can one assume a jew one meets also supports Israel and the occupation of Palestine? Can one blame any American one meets for the war in Iraq? How does one know the American one meets in Denmark voted for Bush and is still part of that 20% who still support him? A man in a particular state of mind or with a general mental illness is not going to think very deeply about these distinctions. And, when push comes to shove, a mob mentality can arise and, if you don't consider all the facts and realities, it might lead you to a very naive conclusion.

Oh, I certainly agree. And I have not been claiming that Arabs are inate anti-semitic. Obviously it is the Israeli conflict that has created this hate. In a previous post you rightly mentioned how they lived together with no serious problems for centuries upon centuries in the Arab world before Zionism. So yes, that certainly is the root cause and the reason why more anti-semitism exists in the Arab community. Which you yourself also conclude with your examples about Indians, Iraqis etc. So I actually don't think we're in disagreement on that part.

&gt; Either way, what this one man did was wrong. Violence never justifies violence, but, if you place it in context, you begin to understand what motivates people to do some things. Otherwise you run the risk of vilifying a group of people as genetically violent/evil and another group of people (in this case) as perpetual victims.

Certainly. But I also think it is important to notice that it has become increasingly harder being a Jew in Europe with our Arab immigration, and that the hardships of *any* minority should be taken seriously; also when those hardships are caused by another minority, which is something that has taken the Danish left wing a long time to realize (and kudos to Villy for that, regardless of the rampant populism). Even worse is claiming that the anti-semitism doesn't exist or is irrelevant because it doesn't portray a good picture of the people you are sympathetic to."

&gt; Microsoft, as an active member of the W3C, is at least partially to blame for that.

Fair enough, but the point remains: W3C is too slow to take action, and thus its unfair to force any vendor to follow their standards.

MS being an active member of W3C only further negates an argument that they aren't cooperative with the rest of the community.

&gt; Microsoft is a convicted monopolist. That means that they, instead of improving the quality or price of their software, spent efforts in marginalizing the quality or price of their competitors.

A very good point. I disagree however:

1) MS is not really ""convicted"", they settled with the DOJ. Regardless, that's in the US, not the EU.

2) The basis for US v. Microsoft was essentially 2 things: 

- MS Windows had undocumented APIs which gave IE an unfair advantage (never proven, but anyone who's written Windows software for a number of years has found undocumented, and extremely powerful, Windows API functions).

- At the time, the argument was that download speeds were so slow that they prohibited consumers from downloading an alternative browser. Having IE pre-installed thus was argued to be a nearly insurmountable advantage.

Neither one of these things is now true - MS opened up the APIs as part of the original settlement, and downloading a new app is no longer a big deal.

Basically, I'm not arguing if the original case was valid, I'm saying this one isn't.

I'd be curious to hear your thoughts."

 &gt;The holocaust was about systematically killing millions of Jews (and Gypsys), not about money or land.

 This is easy to label this way in hindsight. There's two ways to approach it, a) you label the holocaust the act of killing the jews, or b) you label the holocaust the whole thing (including the displacement, dispossession, humiliation, and ultimately extermination of people).

 Given case a), it's trivial that the holocaust didn't arise out of nowhere. It had years of ""preparation"", years of actions taken (like ghettos) that eventually lead to the ""final solution"". 

 In case b), we can not simply say that anything that doesn't end up in the systematic extermination of 5 million people doesn't count or is in no way comparable to the holocaust. We can not say it, partially because the lead up of the holocaust was just as important as the extermination itself.

 In that sense, it would be *patently foolish* for anyone to repeat verbatim the actions of the Nazis and incinerate or gas palestinians. The parallel would be beyond doubt. But just because they don't do that one symbolic gesture doesn't mean the rest isn't comparable.

 It's like saying a rose without the flower isn't a rose, it's just some plant. It's still a rose.

 In that sense, the systematic degradation, segregation and suffering inflicted on the palestinians is very much on par with what happened in Europe in the late thirties."

 Hang out at a train station in Europe and the people with backpacks are almost all Americans while the people with suitcases are almost always Europeans.

I would only have to drag my suit case from the train station to the hotel, which was never very far.

However, the UN voted for it after troops had landed on the peninsula. This vote was done when the USSR was out of the room and, of course, would have made the act illegal by the USSR's veto vote in the security counsel.

So it was a matter of whether a man was in the room or not that allowed the American invasion of Korea to happen. That seems like a rather fine line, Jotaroh.

We differ on ideology. You seem to think there's an obligatory relationship between countries and international law. I know the application of international law is consensual. See Israel, the Softwood lumber dispute between Canada and the USA, Israel's use of chemical-incendiary weapons in Gaza, and Germany in the 1930s. They follow these arbitrary rules because they wish to. When they don't want to follow it, then they don't.

You may say that doing so-and-so is illegal. Feel free to do that. You can do it along with the other people, like the extreme Christians who say gay marriage is illegal based on a internationally recognized book (Sidenote: There have been arguments that have put the bible as the international relations ""codex"" of laws during the period in which it was dominant in relations; see medieval period, Pre-Enlightenment Europe, and Holy Roman empire). If no sovereign enforces rules then there is no question of whether or not it's legal--although you can use the word all you want.

When legality is defined it is normally termed as rules with punishments for wrongful actions. Legality becomes empty when there is no weight behind it, Jotaroh. Feel free to use the word, though.

And the UN's mission to halt war? Interesting. It didn't stop the massacre of the Palestinians, did it? Nor did it halt the Rwandan fiasco. It piddled around before eventually getting to Yugoslavia and only then because the USA showed a direct interest. Or the ongoing Congolese civil war. And what about the other numerous, racially-motivated civil wars of Africa? And of the world? Never mind about the mounting Kenyan problem?

I am of the opinion that the Realist approach is the proper way to view the world--you should read up on it. I suggest Wikipedia. You seem to enjoy a difference persuasion. So, Jotaroh, it's a difference of ideology that we split.

My original point was that Ignatief's view is different than that of Harper's pro-Zionist parade. I think I have sufficiently proved it. I suppose it's moot now that Israel and Gaza have, sort of, come to a ceasefire.

I hope you, too, have learnt something today, Jotaroh."

As someone who's lived in Europe *3 years* and backpacked and traveled around several countries several times, that ""guide"" is about 50% generic backpacking advice, and the other 50% is wrong. It's one person's experience at best. People wear jeans all the time (guys and girls). You don't have to worry about looking ""like a tourist"" because wearing dress pants and then tugging along a backpack looks more ridiculous. Also, most/many people speak English if you politely ask (French not included) specially in Benelux, mixing drinks is common, and so on.. Also, the Eurail pass can turn out expensive. Try to buy tickets as and when you need it and take advantage of national/local special tickets. I've backpacked around Germany once for a weekend (only, but I lived there) for €40 with a group of 5, and that included my food costs. And traveled in a closed polygon in Belgium for €45 over 3 months, with journeys left to spare. Flying Ryanair can also turn out cheaper than train.

Also, ignore whoever says ""hostels are getting expensive, hotels are only $20 more"". That's bullshit advice. Most hostels cost less than €25, some very good ones in cheaper parts of Europe like Barcelona have hostels for €16 and Paris has some for €12, most of the no more than 4 bed dorms. A backpacker can't afford a friggin hotel room at €50/night. And dorms are fun to meet fellow travelers.

One tip though - try to visit each city/country at a time when they are having their annual festivals or similar events. This means Love Parade, Gent Feesten, White Sensation and so on..

&gt;[Dark Age or Dark Ages is a term in historiography referring to a period of cultural decline or societal collapse that supposedly took place in Western Europe between the fall of Rome and the eventual recovery of learning.[1][2][3] The dating of the ""Dark Ages"" has always been fluid, but the concept was originally intended to denote the entire period between the fall of Rome in the 5th century and the ""Renaissance"" or ""rebirth"" of classical values.[4] Increased understanding of the accomplishments of the Middle Ages in the 19th century challenged the characterization of the entire period as one of darkness,[4] and thus the term is often restricted to periods within the Middle Ages, namely the Early Middle Ages; though this is disputed by most modern scholarship as well.[1] Modern scholarship tends to avoid using the phrase.[5]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Ages)"

1) Sounds like you're going to be stoned. Everyone else is too (tourists at least), and count on 1/2 of them being drunk. At the time I was there a ton of people were on mushrooms, but I'm not sure how relevant that will be since smartshops aren't selling them anymore.

3) There are canals everywhere, meaning its all going to look basically the same since you're stoned and have the memory of a goldfish.

The question of disallowing Arab parties seems designed to disallow Arab Israelis expressing their likely disapproval of the onslaught in the elections, ie. this is about increasing Olmert's chances of winning.

Here in the USA, for all its flaws -- and I know it has many -- you can be just as much American as anyone else, no matter where you're from, what you look like, or what (if any) religion you follow.  Could a man who's father was from Europe ever become PM of Japan?  Could someone who's father was from China become President of France?  Colin Powell got press for saying on TV that if Obama was a Muslim, so what?  A Muslim could serve as president of the USA.  Maybe it won't happen soon, but it could happen.  Can you imagine an important government official going on TV in Turkey and saying that a Christian could be the head of their government?

Patriotism is often done badly, no question.  The USA has lots of things wrong with it, nobody sane would deny it.  But the *ideals* are the right ones; our Founders did something important when they chose those ideals and put them on paper; and while we've never lived up to them -- and never truly will, even if we get close -- the USA does some things really really right.

Being patriotic about those things is nothing to apologise for.

This is the same justification under which the Soviet Union held onto Eastern Europe throughout the Cold War.  Western Europe had invaded Russia/The USSR twice before, with thoroughly disastrous results, and Stalin signed on with Roosevelt and Churchill to ensure that it wouldn't happen a third time.

Certainly it provided a buffer zone between Berlin and Moscow.  Certainly Moscow had a very reasonable suspicion that Western Europe had aggressive designs on them--although the Nazis were defeated, the heads of state in Western Europe loathed and feared Communism and the state that bore its standard.  Certainly the Soviets never suffered a direct attack from the West throughout its existence.  Did the Eastern Bloc stave off an attack?  Had the Soviets not taken Eastern Europe, would the West have toppled the USSR?  Without turning back history and running it a second time, we can't really say.

We can with some certainty point to the results of the occupation on the occupied territories.  East Germany, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and the Ukraine all, to varying degrees, suffered significant hardships due to the Soviet occupation.  Development in the Eastern Bloc was severely stunted; once-prosperous nations like Czechoslovakia fell behind Western Europe, and are only now recovering.

It's always risky to assume what the other person thinks.  You run the risk of showing yourself up as a bit of an ass.  No, I don't see things in those terms.  I see the Palestinian people as victims of Israeli expansionism, brutality and collective punishment.  I see that armed resistance as embodied in Hamas as an unavoidable development from that.

I completely agree, even if you don't see it.

Maybe my fears will be completely unfounded.  Maybe Emanuel will not push Obama towards a partisan pro-Israel policy.  Maybe they will win sufficient respect from the arab world to successfully play a negotiation role.  I really hope so.

The signs so far are for an even harder line to be taken.  And this is what depresses me.  I had hoped we had seen the back of Bush's failures.

Was [The Washington Post](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/nov/13/obamas-ambiguity/) wrong when it says that Emanuel was one of 33 signatories to a letter complaining that Bush was too soft?  From that op-ed:

In June 2003, Mr. Emanuel signed a letter criticizing President Bush for being insufficiently supportive of Israel. ""We were deeply dismayed to hear your criticism of Israel for fighting acts of terror,"" Mr. Emanuel, along with 33 other Democrats, wrote to Mr. Bush. The letter asserted that Israel's policy of assassinating Palestinian political leaders ""was clearly justified as an application of Israel's right to self-defense."" Such killings violate the Geneva Conventions, and the State Department's human-rights report specified that there were more civilian bystanders killed in Israeli assassination attempts than actual targets in 2003."

It was late in the night, 3-4 AM. A long and not-that-wide boulevard with a small garden in the middle, all along the boulevard. Nobody walking the street but me. 

Suddenly, I see two men in their mid-30s forcing a girl about 30-y-o to go with them. They were pulling her from the hair and the arm and she was crying.

It was clear I could do nothing against those two: I was 22 at the time and in good shape but they were two and each one was twice my size. So I dial 112 (911 in Europe), tell them what's happening. I tell them the two men and the girl are moving: write down my mobile phone number and call me when the policemen are around. I start following them from the opposite side of the avenue, taking care of not being seen or heard, using the garden to camouflage.

After about 30 minutes, I receive a phone call: it was the paramedics! It took them an astonishingly 30 MINUTES to come! Paramedics arrived first, just in time to see them kick and punch the poor girl in the face. A couple of minutes later, policemen arrived and arrested the two men. Paramedics took care of the girl and there was a happy ending.

&gt; Did the USSR's right to a buffer zone against Western Europe supersede the right of self-determination for Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, Slovaks, and others? If the USSR's occupation of the Eastern Bloc was unacceptable, and Israel's occupation of Palestine is acceptable, what is the difference that makes it so?

I think neither is unacceptable on its face; what makes them unacceptable is that the people in question were deprived of, as you said, self-determination.  The USSR could have built military bases in Eastern Europe and used economic soft power to maintain allies there.  This is what the US has done all around the world, without any imminent threat of invasion, and while we're not exactly well-liked for it, I think it's a fairly minor offense in the history of imperialism.  Instead, the USSR went quite a bit further, on some occasions sending their military into these countries to put down revolutions.

This is the standard to which Israel should be judged.  If they can support Palestinian self-determination while maintaining a military presence to deter aggression, fine.

As a final side note I'd like to point out that the Palestinians self-determined to elect Hamas to their parliament; likewise, the Communist governments of Eastern Europe had at times wide support among their own people."
