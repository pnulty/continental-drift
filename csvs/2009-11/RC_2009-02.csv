This is being modded down because, while English is easy for a European or a Chinese person to learn, English is extremely difficult for a Japanese person to learn.  I'll spare this forum the list of differences between the languages, but it boils down to forgetting how to talk and relearning from the ground up.

Just as one doesn't have to see goose-stepping soldiers down the high street before a nation is considered fascist a right to vote is not the be-all and end-all decider to whether an association with apartheid is correct.  I'm sure you are aware that when citizenship is taken is Israel a Palestinian's nationality is noted as Arab and an Jewish Israeli is noted as Jew - that right there marks the beginning of what unravels into apartheid.

Israel's nationality laws prevents a Palestinian citizen of Israel married to someone from the OT from living together in Israel.  Apartheid South Africa's supreme court overturned that.  [Israel's high court upheld it in 2006 and again in 2008](http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/996697.html) - in case you missed it that was an Israeli newspaper using the 'A' word.  [Marriage laws](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-imposes-racist-marriage-law-588637.html), sure a Palestinian and an Israeli can marry but a 12y.o. child from such a marriage must emigrate.   Then there are the agricultural laws that denote certain land as Jewish and so can't be sold to non-Jews, and what is the nationality of a Palestinian come Israeli citizen known as again: Arab.  Then there are the ""Arab free"" industries, for those in the military and security.  

[Then there are the building permits and incentives...again nationality is seen to be a prerequisite, or rather a 'Jewish' nationality identity.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/feb/06/southafrica.israel)

[And unfortunately if one moves from focusing on the inequality in Israel to the West Bank it gets even worse...](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/this-is-like-apartheid-anc-veterans-visit-west-bank-865063.html)

It goes on.  Some measures get overturned, like the recent banning of Arab parties in next month's election, some don't.  It is important however to mention that that doesn't mean all Israelis should be tarred with the same brush.  [They shouldn't.  Just as in all walks in life there are differences and I believe in empowering Israeli moderates who know something is amiss.](http://www.acri.org.il/eng/Story.aspx?id=351)

&gt;You are very apt to dismiss what Hamas says. Go back and watch the video AGAIN.

No, I very appropriately provided you with an article that establishes what Hamas means between 'accept' and 'acknowledge'.  That and the [MEMRI](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLFd4dlHPnc) source (dude I wouldn't go and post a stormfront article to argue how Israel was bad...hopefully we both acknowledge they can't be trusted.  [Memri translations, editing, cherry picking and context cannot be trusted](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/jan/28/israel2)) Hamas leadership has even reiterated their willingness to accept Israel since the recent escalation to French and UK delegates on behalf of the EU.

&gt;I answered my view on 1967 border in separate thread.

Y'up well that's the direction you need to be headed because in all honesty Israel's PR skirt is slipping in light of recent events.  America itself is in trouble and radicalising serves no purpose.  Israel will be best served to locate itself peacefully into a post-American Israeli era.  It would be far easier than to not and to look for them in times of trouble and to find them not there.

""Unregulated Corporations Will Not Always Act In The Public Interest.""

Don't get me wrong, neither will anybody else. Consumers will buy cheaper goods from overseas whenever practical. Small businesses will always try (and it's wise to do so) to reduce expenses, including employee health care, wages and other benefits. I don't even have to mention politicians and lawyers.

But somehow a lot of people refuse to believe my headline. They like to blame our failing auto industry on the workers, ignoring how the currently successful auto industries compensate their workers -- Japanese auto workers are some of the best compensated in the country, and they got a (slight, but) pay raise in '07. Europeans get universal health care and famously generous vacation time. 

We buy their cars not because they're cheaper up front, but because they usually prove cheaper in the long run. The only car I've ever truly *loved* was my Flamin' Chicken (see Apu), but my Civic refused to break and my Mazda hasn't needed a single repair in 64,000 miles. 

That's just one example where axiomatic philosophies get thrown around instead of facing some tough facts. (And a lot of those philosophies have their roots in that ""dismal science,"" economics. Anyone who's actually studied economics knows this joke: ""What do you get when you put three economists in a room? Four opinions."")

The purchase was made because it was incredibly cheap (a few cents an acre) and because if the US didn't take it then the British might have taken it (though it's hard to imagine Napoleon would have sold it to his enemy, stranger things have happened in European politics).

New Deal - The Social Security Ponzi scheme? Yeah, you're gonna find out pretty soon why this is one of the worst things the government could have ever done. National Highways? They effectively destroyed small town America and created highly wasteful and unsustainable suburban sprawl, all in the name of defending against invasion (from where?!). You're gonna find out soon why this too was a really bad idea, if you haven't already.

Marshall Plan - Effectively reigned in the economies of western Europe, basically forcing them to be client states. It can be argued that they were better off under our rule than that of the Soviets, but that doesn't excuse what it really is: economic empire-building (and they *hardly* paid us back).

NASA - Yeah, they did a good job in the beginning, as far as advancing our understanding of the universe and whatnot. However, it has grown to become a bureaucratic giant. It's failing, and it's painfully obvious that private companies are much more capable of doing the jobs we need done today and in the future.

BRADDOCK, Pa. — As Americans wonder just how horrible the economy will become, this tiny steel town offers a perverse message of hope: Things cannot possibly get any worse than they are here.
 
Lisa Kyle for The New York Times
The mayor, John Fetterman, with tattoos of the dates of killings during his time in office.
 
Hunched on the eastern edge of the Monongahela River only a few miles from bustling Pittsburgh, Braddock is a mix of boarded-up storefronts, houses in advanced stages of collapse and vacant lots.

The state has classified it a “distressed municipality” — bankrupt, more or less — since the Reagan administration. The tax base is gone. So are most of the residents. The population, about 18,000 after World War II, has declined to less than 3,000. Many of those who remain are unemployed. Real estate prices fell 50 percent in the last year.

“Everyone in the country is asking, ‘Where’s the bottom?’ ” said the mayor, John Fetterman. “I think we’ve found it.”

Mr. Fetterman is trying to make an asset out of his town’s lack of assets, calling it “a laboratory for solutions to all these maladies starting to knock on the door of every community.” One of his first acts after being elected mayor in 2005 was to set up, at his own expense, a Web site to publicize Braddock — if you can call pictures of buildings destroyed by neglect and vandals a form of promotion.

He has encouraged the development of urban farms on empty lots, which employ area youths and feed the community. He started a nonprofit organization to save a handful of properties.

In an earlier era, Braddock was a famed wellspring of industrial might. The steel baron Andrew Carnegie put his first mill in the town, the foundation of an empire that helped build modern America. With the loot and guilt Mr. Carnegie piled up, he also built a library here, the first of more than 1,500 Carnegie libraries in the United States.

Immigrants came to work in the mill, and through ceaseless agitation won union representation that enabled their children — helped by the library on the hill — to achieve a better life.

A local boy, Thomas Bell, celebrated this hard-won success in his autobiographical 1941 novel “Out of This Furnace.” The story recounts the strivings of three generations in Braddock’s mill and their transformation from exploited and maligned “Hunkies” from Eastern Europe into full-fledged Americans.

This year, the town will be featured in the film version of another work of art, Cormac McCarthy’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel “The Road.” Set in a post-Armageddon America where food is so scarce that many survivors turned to cannibalism, “The Road” was shot partially in Braddock.

A town whose story has evolved from building America to making Americans to eating Americans for dinner might seem a hard sell. So Mr. Fetterman, who is paid $150 a month, also promotes Braddock as a place to buy extremely cheap real estate.

Erik and Shannon Gustafson heeded that call. The couple were living in Chicago, where Mr. Gustafson was a part-time commodities trader, when they heard about Braddock last winter. They settled on a two-bedroom house whose owner warned them that it had black mold and was probably a tear-down. Her price: $4,750.

The Gustafsons paid the money and discovered that the mold problem was overstated. “Space is cheap here,” said Mr. Gustafson, 30. “We can afford to focus on our hobbies.” He is a graphic designer; she is a photographer.

Joel Rice, a furniture maker, bought a 15,000-square-foot former car dealership that he is converting to a showroom, workshop and home, with a greenhouse on the roof. The building cost $70,000, perhaps a tenth of what he would have had to pay for a tiny shop in Oregon, where he was living.

It will take at least two more years to clear the debris and put in new wiring, plumbing and fixtures. But Mr. Rice, 38, is undaunted. “If all our effort here crashes and burns,” he said, “it won’t be because we held anything back.”

Unlike many stricken steel towns, Braddock never lost its mill. Part of the U.S. Steel system, it still employs nearly a thousand workers. But they no longer live in town, and the stores followed them to the suburbs. Eventually, only the stubborn and those without resources remained.

“Even the bars and liquor stores closed,” said Ron Kutnansky, who was born in Braddock in 1953 and lived there and in North Braddock for decades.

A custodian at the University of Pittsburgh, Mr. Kutnansky finally moved out three years ago, after his home was broken into for the third time. “It’s a fairly big shame what happened to Braddock,” he said. He sold his house for a dollar, no regrets.


The mill town once had 18,000 residents.
 
Now it has 3,000 and is full of abandoned buildings.
 
As Mr. Kutnansky was leaving, a political novice was starting to shake things up. Mr. Fetterman, now 39, is hard to miss, at 6-foot-8 and 325 pounds, with a shaved head and goatee. He has a master’s degree in public policy from Harvard but came to Braddock in 2001 to work for a county youth program. He won the May 2005 Democratic primary by exactly one vote. (He faced no opposition in the general election.)

The mayor wears his commitment to Braddock not on his sleeve but under it: On his right arm are tattooed five dates memorializing killings in Braddock during his time in office. The victims included a man delivering a pizza and a 2-year-old girl who was assaulted and then dropped into a snow-covered playground. She froze to death while trying to walk home.

On his other arm is a large 15104, the town’s ZIP code.

This impressed many of the younger residents. “I was shocked, because he’s not even from around here,” said Jeremy Cannon, 23.

Mr. Fetterman’s official powers are limited, partly because of Braddock’s “distressed municipality” status and partly because it is technically a borough overseen by a borough council. The council president, Jesse Brown, did not return telephone calls for an interview.

Mostly, the mayor offers encouragement, ideas and energy. With the financial help of his father, who owns a commercial insurance agency in York, Pa., he also makes direct and indirect investments in local real estate. He set up the nonprofit organization, Braddock Redux, and gave it $50,000 to buy a former Presbyterian church to serve as a community center.

Last year, Mr. Fetterman gave the organization another $12,000 — money he says he got by draining his 401(k) — to buy a duplex and another house next door. The next step was securing a grant from the Buhl Foundation in Pittsburgh to refurbish the buildings for six at-risk teenagers who, at 18, were too old for foster care. Run by two members of AmeriCorps, the group house will open this month.

“Where a lot of people would see a series of negatives — a bankrupt community with deteriorating housing, foster kids aging out of the system and confronting a lack of employment — John saw potential,” said Frederick Thieman, president of the Buhl Foundation.

One of Mr. Fetterman’s biggest coups was persuading a small alternative energy company, Fossil Free Fuel, to secure a warehouse on Braddock Avenue.

“This is a very welcoming place for a business, because it has so few,” said Fossil Free’s co-owner, David Rosenstraus.

All this is movement in the right direction, but the uninhabited buildings are still falling down. Dozens are scheduled for demolition. “If struggling communities don’t preserve their architecture,” Mr. Fetterman said, “there’s no chance of any resurgence down the line.” Sometime soon, he worries, Braddock will pass the point of no return.

I've always held the position that its how a person treats everyone else that matters, not how they treat their fellow aristocrats.

Back in medieval Europe many knights made a big deal about their honor.  In battle if they disarmed another knight they'd let him retrieve his weapon because of that honor.  But, the same knight who would let a fellow knight rearm would not think of extending that courtesy to a landless footsoldier.  Honor, gentle behavior, etc was for fellow ""gentleman"", not for the hoi polloi.

The same can be said about most ""gentlemen"" throughout history.  Their courtly behavior, codes of honor, etc all applied only to other gentlemen.  Which brings us back to the topic at hand.

Most wealthy people in the CSA were ""gentlemen"", but that only affected their behavior for people in their social class.  The same southern gentleman who might express outrage if someone neglected to hold a door for a ""lady"" would see nothing wrong with casual cruelty, or mere indifference, to a woman of the lower classes, and certainly saw nothing wrong with slave women working in fields. They were outside his social strata, and thus his honor, his gentlemanly behavior, simply didn't apply to them.

Which is why I object to the use of the term as a superlative in the case of Lee, or most other people of his era.  If the term is to have any meaning at all it should be to describe someone who is honorable, gentle, etc to all individuals regardless of social class.",1233546260,t1_c07evlv,0,False,politics,t1_c07eubd,False,True,,t3_7tyer,c07evlv,1425919304,0,

The argument that certain Redditors have this hatred/obsession about Israel because they are American and therefore ""pay for it"" is complete bunk. _Most_ Americans don't hate or obsess about Israel with the particular fervor of a certain few Redditors here, although they too ""pay for it"". 

It's worth noting that Americans _do_ in fact ""pay for"" the Sri Lankan government's military campaign against the Tiger rebels: the US gives direct military aid to Sri Lanka, and has for years. .

I suspect that the entire tax contribution of all American redditors to the Israeli military machine is a grand sum of less than $1000 dollars a year, given that this site is mostly populated by students, jobless, juveniles, and freelance web coders. Sheeeyit, maybe if you wrote Israel a cross letter they'd send the cash back.

So: the real reason Most Redditors dont care about Sri Lanka, or DR Congo, or Southern Thailand? Because really they dont give a shit about anyone, Palestinians included, and their only interest in the Gaza conflict that it's a handy stick to beat Israel with.

His lyrics are often in spoken word or badly sung, not to mention full of grammatical errors, reversed semantic units, and meta-references to thick Slavic accents. For example the song opens with: ""Hey baby, wake up from your asleep. We have arrived onto the future and the whole world is become elektronik, supersonik."" The end of the song contains a reference to the fictitios Eastern European country Molvania. It was featured in a recent ad campaign for Mountain Dew MDX. It also carries a heavy sexual undertone.

I agree to some extent, but I generally don't hear people use the term ""race"" to refer to the Sioux or the Croats, for example. They would be called a population or an ethnic group.

&gt;One person defines a Black as someone with dark skin, large lips and curly black hair, another person defines black as someone whose ancestors came from subsaharan africa. 

This is not the distinction in usage I was referring to. This is just ""ethnicity"" being used as a euphemism for ""race.""

&gt;But when it comes down to it, both definitions are almost as valid, and both will correlate well with genetic data.

They will only correlate with very specific genetic data, and even those specific data will generally only correlate well with smaller, more isolated and defined groups. There is far more variation within ""races"" (black, white, asian, etc.) than between them, and most of the inter-group variation is superficial (hair, skin color, eye color, etc) and all of these variations are fluid within the ""races"" themselves. Being able to say that people from one arbitrarily-delineated area (i.e. ""Asia"") are more likely to have a certain blood type than people from another (i.e. ""Europe"") may be useful for certain purposes, but I would not say that race correlates well with genetic data.

I would agree with you if we were a self sufficient country and only buying your goods because we have the extra money to do so, but that's simply not true.

I expressed myself in too much of a hurry. I'm sorry for that and will try to elaborate.

""Fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power."" A quote popularly attributed to Benito Mussolini. 

Fascism is capitalist nationalist tyranny. The opposite extreme of a socialist tyranny. One classic feature is that a fascist government has no clear economic plan, as opposed to rigid socialist planning. Laissez faire economics is the norm, which is certainly true with Bush. 

Don't attribute everything to mere coincidence about the Bush regime. Cheney favoring Halliburton, his ex-company, was no simple coincidence. Neither was the fact that Blackwater had MORE troops in Iraq than the US military (they needed to avoid a draft to keep support). And Bush? Well, he promised non-interventionist policies and fiscal restraint during the election. The complete opposite of what he then went and actually did. (And don't say ""9/11 changed everything"" cause the Iraq war was planned long before that). 

As far as I'm concerned Bush didn't hold any ideology other than lining the pockets of himself and his mates. So I agree with you they were stubborn assholes, but they committed treason against their nation and their people to obtain personal goals that's a pretty serious thing to do. Not something you should shrug off. 

&gt;The only reason they're demonized is because they demonize us and have contrary government types.

No, my friend. That's not the only reason. Most of them actually have a good reason to demonize you cause of your long history of violent interventions in their countries. I'm not saying you should kiss their asses cause quite a few of them are pretty nasty dictators, but your media seem to have little to no understanding of why they are right to be criticising you. There is no admittance of your own guilt or historical contributions to the current status quo. You like to take credit for good stuff to bask in your own glory (I've met Americans who believe they single handedly beat Hitler), but if it's anything bad it doesn't get mentioned. This is what's called ""propaganda"" in short, and Americans are huge victims of it and have been for generations.

&gt; You get a government that has a similar type as us and then tell us you aren't going to do something we're like we will be upset but we're not going to kill you.

Tell that to Saddam..

&gt; The GDP of the EU is as much as the United States, you're not weak, start standing up against unjust things instead of just talking about it.

We're not in the EU, and the reason for that, is that we are aware we won't have any say in the EU. We're too small to join a block democracy where we make up 1% of the total population. So ""we, the people"" in Norway voted against it twice. 

The EU forced us in anyway. They just called our membership something else, and our politicians had to go behind our back to finish the horse trade. That's how much power we have. We now pay heavy yearly dues to the EU and they control our export and import rates, but we lost the 1% voting influence we could have had (which would have made no difference to be honest.)

&gt; In fact, people do live in crowded conditions, and always have. We cluster together in cities and villages in order to exchange goods and services with one another. But while we crowd together for economic reasons in our great metropolitan areas, most of the world is empty, as we can see when we fly over it. It has been estimated by Paul Ehrlich and others that human beings actually occupy no more than 1 to 3 percent of the earth's land surface. 

&gt; If you allotted 1250 square feet to each person, all the people in the world would fit into the state of Texas. Try the math yourself: 7,438,152,268,800 square feet in Texas, divided by the world population of 5,860,000,000, equals 1269 square feet per person. The population density of this giant city would be about 21,000 somewhat more than San Francisco and less than the Bronx. 

&gt; Another fact: World population growth is rapidly declining. United Nations figures show that the 79 countries that comprise 40 percent of the world's population now have fertility rates too low to prevent population decline. The rate in Asia fell from 2.4 in 1965-70 to 1.5 in 1990-95. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the rate fell from 2.75 in 1960-65 to 1.70 in 1990-95. In Europe, the rate fell to 0.16 that is, effectively zero in 1990-95. And the annual rate of change in world population fell from 2 percent in 1965-70 to less than 1.5 percent in 1990-95. Worldwide, the number of children the typical woman had during her lifetime (total fertility) fell from 5 in 1950-55 to less than 3 in 1990-95. (The number necessary just to “replace” the current generation is 2.1.) In the more developed regions, total fertility fell from 2.77 to 1.68 over the same period. In the less developed regions it fell from more than 6 to 3.3. Total fertility in Mexico was 3.1 in 1990-95. In Spain it stood at 1.3, and in Italy, it was 1.2.

I've been watching liberal white friends of me consistently think of Ethiopia has a victim of colonialism despite the fact that Ethiopia exists because their former emperors colluded with Europeans to conquer their neighbours and unfair trade even though the government barely does anything to control the high population growth, focuses intensely on Agriculture yet refusing to allow people to buy their own land (all land is owned by the government).

Last year when Mugabe stole the election in Zimbabwe his supporters went around and attacked and killed MDC supporters. In Ethiopia when students protested against the stolen election they  were brutally gunned down in the streets by the police. 200 of them died and 700 were injured. The government arrested the protesters and jailed the opposition party. Ethiopia is still getting AID from USA and EU.

There was an insurgency in Easter Ethiopia by Somalis who don't want to be part of Ethiopia. In a normal country the government would try to bring the civilians on their side to weaken the Insurgents. The Ethiopian Army surrounded villages in Eastern Ethiopia,raped,killed and razed villages. The food aid sent to the poor were diverted to the Army has a punishment to the civilians.

In 2006 Ethiopia armed and funded along with the CIA warlords in Somalia. The warlords were defeated. The government then sent the army to Somalia in the only city held by their stooges and then denied. They were given a warning by Somali Islamists to leave Somalia or face a war. They told the international community that the Islamists were Al-Qaeda. They ""offically invaded to defend"" themselves and the war lead to a 2 and half year Insurgency that lead to the deaths of 16,000 Somali civilians mostly at the hands of the Ethiopian army and their allied Somali militias.

They officially left (all though they still keep on entering)Somalia and the very same Islamists they accused of being Al-Qaeda is now the head of the government and is currently in Ethiopia in an African Union meeting.

They refuse to give Eritrea (a country ruled by an equally repressive regime who atleast don't pretend to be human rights loving democrats) back land that was officially given to it by the UN. The only reason according to John Bolton is because of Condeleeza Rice's protege Jendayi Frazer is Pro-Ethiopian.

The government responded to high food inflation by arresting traders.

Really? The Palestinians started this? By having their land taken from them by Europeans to assuage the European's guilt?

&gt; No mercy and compassion to palestinians until they renounce violence, period.

So speaks the voice of the man carrying the big stick. Israeli violence, through the use of a modern well equipped military is okay. Palestinian violence through the use of bottle rockets and AK47s is bad. This is apples and oranges here - a poorly equipped peoples militia versus a well equipped nation state.

Yes, really. Britain conquered Palestine and allowed jews to move in. Surrounding arab countries incited violent assault on jews by palestinian arabs, and that's how the ball started rolling. 

&gt; Or are you thinking more short-term - by declaring and adhering to a ceasefire, but the Israelis didn't hold up their end of the bargain (the lifting of the blockade) throughout the ceasefire, and then the Israelis broke the ceasefire? And that is the fault of the Palestinians?

The blockade will not be lifted until it is guaranteed that Hamas is unable to rearm. This is the lesson we've learned from the last time and if politicians have any brains, they will follow it to the letter. If there is no blockade, they *will* smuggle in weapons and send out suicide bombers. And don't give me the ceasefire excuses, Hamas dug a kidnapping tunnel.

&gt; Israeli violence, through the use of a modern well equipped military is okay.

Apparently it isn't clear to you when and why IDF attacks palestinians.

&gt; Palestinian violence through the use of bottle rockets and AK47s is bad. This is apples and oranges here - a poorly equipped peoples militia versus a well equipped nation state.

Why does it matter at all? Why does it have to be fair, or proportional? 

&gt; Unfortunately you fail to see that the rest of the world has suddenly noticed the disparate position.

It's been quite obvious for decades. What they have noticed, however, is that Hamas is a terrorist organization with a long history - that's why no one wants to talk to them, and even arab countries distance themselves from them.

&gt;  Israel has lost a lot of common support by people who can now see the disparity in the positions.

No, lefties got louder and more obnoxious, and even more one-sided.

I agree that patent system doesn't spur innovation, drive up R&amp;D costs and all other things you mentioned. We don't have enforced software patents (thank god) in Europe and I don't think that it is a problem. 

The thing is, I believe that if inventor publishes his invention (good invention, not some junk) for all humanity to see, he should get something for it (definitely not 20 year monopoly, but maybe head start for his product or something). Do you agree?



One classic example that is showing benefit of patents in textbooks (Ok, not textbooks, but it was in three books I have read): drugs.

I will throw many numbers from my sleeve.

Big Pharma Company (BPC) is trying to find new drug. 9 out of 10 research projects fail on something (sorry, it just doesn't work | well, it causes liver failure in 80% of cases).

Yay, one of 10 projects succeeds. Patent it. Conduct tests on animals, people and all that stuff. 3 years gone.

Ask FDA for approval. another 3 years gone.

Now, I have ~ 14 years to sell my product to cover costs of all 10 research projects, all testing and make profit.

If BPC would't have patent, any other rival company could just buy new drug, analyze it for few millions and put it on market (no need for studies, everything was paid for by BPC) and BPC wouldn't invest into new drugs (it would be more profitable to put money into something else, like marketing).

This example is wrong? 

I am not in R&amp;D nor patent business, just regular programmer(I should probably use term soft. developer, because I have to maintain the code ^_^).

Edit: Everyone can easily see that something is terribly wrong with patent system, when all big corporation in a field have cross-licensing agreements with each other and have common policy for preventing important patents from falling into hands of patent trolls. They are  companies with most patents (and probably most innovative or at least with biggest R&amp;D budget), but have no money from patents (cross-licensing) and have to protect themselves from trolls. Yet they still fill patents and everything. ",1233710182,t1_c07geo4,0,True,technology,t1_c07g7u8,False,True,,t3_7uj85,c07geo4,1425920051,0,

&lt;EDIT: Let's look into this handing over jurisdiction a little more.&gt;

**Republic of Ireland:** 

•Population: 4.4 million, Number of Irish seats in the lower house: 166
= 1 seat per 26,500 Irish citizens.


**Now let's look at Europe:**

•Ireland has 13 MEPs = 1 European seat per 338,000 Irish citizens

•Low ball it, call it 500 million EU citizens with 736 EU seats = 680,000 voters per MEP

•Say Ireland needs to pass something with Europe, all 13 Irish MEPs = 1.7% of the vote


Europe is the equivalent of, in voters per elected official, saying that the Rpublic of Ireland only needs 7 politicians making all the decisions in its lower house instead of 166.  If that's not a step towards totalitarianism I don't know what is!!!

**LESS REPRESENTATIVE**....you're just being wooed by short term gain/profit/fear to hand over hard won independence and liberty and they've got you thinking that you're doing it for DEMOCRACY AS THEY IGNORE ANY AND ALL REFERENDUMS THAT STAND IN THEIR WAY.

&gt; He continued to say that just because something is natural, like the marijuana plant, doesn't mean that it is good for you. 

This is true. Deadly nightshade is natural and..deadly. But Just because not everything natural is good for you doesn't mean pot isn't good for you. In this specific case, it's been used historically as a medicine and confirmed by science. Fear and Doubt, anyone?

&gt; But he said that it would be equally stupid to allow the American population to decide what should be used as medicine by voting to legalize marijuana for medical purposes. He said the population should leave it to scientists and doctors to determine the medical usefulness of marijuana.

This is extra sneaky. Yes, ideally this should be true. Except NIDA has a monopoly on supplying marijuana (unlike all the other scheduled drugs) and refuses to supply pot some studies even if they are FDA approved. The gov't is actively disrupting scientific research and so medical marijuana laws are the only alternative.

&gt; ""If the American people tomorrow voted to legalize marijuana,"" said Stutman, ""I would be okay with that. But it's not up to one group of people to decide.""

For the past 70 years one group HAS been deciding: fear mongering politicians (and more recently the DEA). Is he saying the american people are one group and it's not up to them? Well, he's morally wrong but surprisingly truthful for a drug warrior. Not helping his argument, though.

&gt; Stutman's main reason for opposing the legalization of marijuana is that it will cause an increase in the number of users. He said that it will lead to a higher number of car accidents because more people will choose to drive under the influence of marijuana.

It's plain to see that this greatly outweighs the tremendous damage done by prohibition: corruption, gang violence, private prisons, mandatory minimums, no-knock warrants, etc. Drugged driving and the harms of chronic toking (assuming there are any) are problems you could conceivably beat. But prohibition cannot succeed.

&gt;He cited studies from Europe which allege that marijuana can be physically addictive. He noted marijuana's adverse effects [...] keep them from achieving their full potential. 

This is a personal choice and the gov't has no right to decide for you. And it's totally inconsistent with everything else people engage in daily: driving, skiing, smoking tobacco, drinking booze, rock climbing, etc. In a free country a citizen makes an informed decision about the risks (we hope) and decides his action for himself. If his actions affect others, then he is punished.

&gt; This means that it can cause higher incidences of lung cancer than tobacco cigarettes.

In a few years, more than half of Japan's population will be over 50.  European nations are giving tax incentives and (sometimes) outright cash payouts at the hospital at the time of birth to women who will have more than 2 children.  Still, they see population declines.

Even in the USA, our population would be negative if not for immigration.

In nation after nation, it has been shown that if you give women access to safe and effective birth control, and give them the rights to actually use them, women do a fine job (in general) of managing their own ovaries.  Sometimes, some nations end up thinking they do too good of a job, since they need young workers to pay into the pension system set up for their older workers.

We do not have an overpopulation problem.  We do not have a birth control problem.  We have a women’s rights problem.

We see over population in nations where the only value a woman has is as a breeder.  In places where the only way a woman can have influence or power or worth is to have as many children as possible.

The Population Bomb, written in 1968, is about as relevant today as the original version of the Stepford Wives.  It says more about the culture and zeitgeist of the time than about any actual reality today.  It is something you would do an anthropological case study on, not something you would base policy on, or take as relevant today.

The problems arise when policy-makers read this crap and try to act on it.

Hitler and WW2 had nothing to do with Zionists' intentions to take over Palestine. But the holocaust certainly did help by shifting the world's public opinion in favour of Zionism.

The other issue is that many of the current Israelis aren't even Jewish. Israel tries to attract as many Jews as possible by giving them free homes and farmland (mainly stolen from the Palestinians in the occupied West Bank).

That's why I went on to respond to your comment about the historical argument.

&gt; Can you conceive of a way in which European nations, financially and structurally crippled by WWII, could have made such sweeping gains in the last 50 years without some policy of protectionism, either on the part of America or some other nation that was financially stable after the War?

Yes, I can.  The Soviet model for socialism was unsustainable, and always was.  Once we finished with Germany, we immediately settled on the Soviets as the new enemy, and vice versa.  We didn't necessarily *have* to do that, but we chose to be provoked into it.  It created an era of cold hostility where Eisenhower's military industrial complex was given fertile ground to become the leviathan we have now.  Europe joined NATO in solidarity against the Soviets, but left the bulk of the issue to the US while they focused on internal reform.  We also instituted many reforms, but not to the extent that the Europeans did.

Europeans have been far more relaxed about religion than Americans for a long time.  The more relaxed about it Europeans become, the more obsessed Americans seem to get.  We added ""In God We Trust"" to our money and added ""under God"" to our pledge of allegiance.  Our cultures have diverged wildly, and I can't imagine that education hasn't been one of the driving forces behind that change, particularly as our education rankings decline as our religious sentiments rise.

We've been a nation of anti-intellectuals for some time, and our religious leaders have been at the forefront of this movement.  Why?  What about intellectualism threatens them?

A good friend of mine will be finishing a semester abroad and we're planning on traveling together through Eastern Europe for awhile. But since I'll have a little extra vacation time to kill, I thought I might do some traveling through Western Europe on my own on the front end.
At this point, my biggest concerns are: Where to stay? I've had some pretty good hostel experiences in the past, but has anyone ever used Coachsurfing or similar ideas to try something a little more adventurous? To that point, what are some good ways to meet people (locals, other travelers, etc) while abroad? I wouldn't say I'm outgoing per se but I generally have a pretty easy time making friends once I'm talking to people. I only speak English, by the way. Finally, how much of a concern is safety (for myself and my stuff) when traveling alone? I'm 22 and male and I can't imagine I'll be spending too much time in really sketchy areas of big cities.

What would make you think I would disagree with that?

&gt;You are quite emotionally invested in this subject, aren't you? 

I don't have stronger language.  If you guys don't understand what life and death and ruining the entire fucking planet means, I don't know how otherwise to express the extreme gravity of the subject.  There is NOTHING in the universe more dangerous to humanity than these people that flippantly throw aside anything just cause it doesn't ""feel right.""

You would be dead if they had their way.  You would not have penicillin to cure an illness and would have almost certainly died.  Does that sink home?  If Pasteur were proposing his vaccine today, he would have no chance whatsoever.  He would be insulted and thrown out of whereever he managed to land a job for being a moron to suggest putting disease-causing organisms INTO people, even if they were dead.  Everyone you know, would likely have died in infancy.  Everyone.  Unless you know a TREMENDOUS amount of people, then there may have been 1 that would survive.

How many people died AFTER the germ theory of disease was suggested and rejected?  All of those people are who I'm thinking of when people defend the unthinking simpletons that think how something ""feels"" is more reliable than a statistically valid, scientifically rigorous repeatable peer-reviewed study.

&gt;You seem to feel that folks should believe in all the assertions of scientists as if they were gospel truth.

What the fuck are you smoking?  Are you just ignoring the fact that I have clearly said at every single opportunity that you have to EVALUATE THE SCIENCE BASED ON OBJECTIVITY?  Read the last 3 sentences of the comment you replied to.  Then read them again and again until it seems to you ABSURD to ask me if I think people should accept scientists at their word, because it is the impression you should have gotten the first time you read it.

&gt;Folks in Canada or New Zealand or Britain know how to think critically about scientists' research and their conclusions.

Oh yeah?  Ask someone from Britain what they think about genetically modified food.  That's a fun show, the simpletons go yapping about ""frankenfood"" and start wetting themselves.  You point out that genetically modified rice has saved more people than have ever lived on the planet before it was created and what do they do?  Critically understand that they're being utterly stupid and opposing life-saving technology on the basis of something they half-heard on some talk show?  No, they yell ""Frankenfood"" louder and maybe shove you, that's their version of reason.

There isn't any country in the world right now that isn't wrapped tightly in anti-intellectualism, anti-science, and everything that goes along with it.  Show me a country willing to put ""No law shall be passed that restricts the freedom of a man without scientific proof of harm"" and we'll check the place out together.  Until then, ignore the talk shows and blog posts you've seen babbling ona bout how great Europe is.  They're more obese than Americans (in Britain), they're accepting of ridiculous violations of their freedoms for absurdly childish reasons, etc.  There are scientists everywhere, and there are idiots everywhere.  The scientists mostly try to hide because there are millions more idiots.  And no, it has most decidedly NOT always been this way.  That's the argument I usually get, and it is pure bullshit.  Bit of evidence for why I believe that... before the Revolutionary War, more copies of ""Common Sense"" sold in America than there were homes.  Can you comprehend that?  More than 1 copy per house of a book on the philosophical foundation of just government?  How can anyone say that at that time the average person was not a GENIUS compared to the imbeciles wandering around today, protected by science and technology at every turn, spurning it at the others?

&gt;If you want to help someone otakucode, you have to understand the situation they are in.

Well, I try.  I really do find it hard to relate to people who think ""it seems barbaric"" as reason enough to pass up a potentially life-saving treatment for their children.  Or people who hear ""vaccines got merc'ry in um"" and put their children in mortal danger (never bothering to learn you get 300x more mercury every day in your daily food.  THOUSANDS times more if you eat a can of tuna).  The only way we CAN help those people is to beat them over the head with it, make it socially unacceptable to be an asshole idiot, get met at every single instance with disdain and insults, etc.  It's how they got the way they are in the first place.

&gt;You don't act rashly, otakucode when someone is in trouble. Why? Because you can end up making their problem a whole lot worse - and you can even make problems for yourself.

Right... you ignore your natural inclinations, your natural intuition, and your natural ideas.  You reject them because it has been shown to you that there is an objectively benificial reason.  You could consult studies if you felt the need.  

Do you not realize that the majority of people in this world today would have told that lifeguard teacher to shove it, that all animals swim so they should know how to do it naturally?  If the coach told them to reject their feelings and calm down when someone was in trouble, they would say that doesn't asound right, that sounds like making yourself a robot.  They don't believe in that, so they're not going to listen.  They bumble around, hurting people everywhere they go, with everything they do, and they don't give a shit.  They don't have to because the few scientists and rational thinkers around have managed to put together a rickety framework that keeps them mostly safe no matter how stupid they are.

I agree that it *shouldn't* have, but it has, since Israel defines itself as jewish. The genetic research results hint that Palestinians and jews are probably the same people from the beginning, so one basis for the Israeli nationhood is compromised.

There's also the thing that different jewish groups, like Russian vs European vs ""indigenous"" (ie, the jews that stayed in the ME) have significant genetic differences between each other. The indigenous jewish people, eg, are genetically closer to Palestinians than they are to Russian jews. That's understandable, since the Russian jews never emigrated from the Israel/Palestine region in the first place, but were mostly people in Russia that converted at some point.

Today, the large majority of Israelis are descendants of European or Russians jews. They just flooded the country and overwhelmed indigenous jewish and Arab Palestinians, that had managed to live in relative peace up until then. To me it looks like a lot of the problems have to do with the fact that you had complete foreigners with colonialist mindsets brought from Europe into the place.

Which is what I (and Kagan) meant by Protectionism.  We agreed to supplement European military defense, mostly through NATO, because they served as a buffer zone between us and Soviet expansion.  Eastern Europe in particular was the site of a great deal of contention, for obvious reasons, but Western Europe was able to retreat from defense spending to the extent that, as their financial status grew back to its pre-war rate, those nations were able to institute broad social reforms.  The U.S., on the other hand, was committed to Protectionism and a much higher grade of military spending, which limited the amount that could be spent of social reform.

Another problem, of course, is that the U.S. is a much larger country, with a certain vested interest in Federalism.  European countries tend to be much smaller, and much more concentrated, which meant they had a centralized base from which to institute those reforms.

&gt;One philosophy is based on making an assertion and then asking if it can be disproved. If nobody can disprove it, you accept the assertion.

But that's has nothing to do with the rejecting ideas that ""cannot be falsified""....on the contrary, this is *accepting* ideas that cannot be falsified.

Abandoning claims that ""cannot be falsified"" is classic critical rationalism ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_rationalism ). Karl Popper championed this approach to science and I'm having real trouble with your attempts to relate ""cannot be falsified"" with religion....it seems the complete opposite. 

&gt;The other philosophy is based on making an assertion and then proving it to be true. Once it is proved true, you accept the assertion. This is known as science. example: God exists, or reincarnation exists. Can you prove it? No? Then you can make no assertion as to the validity or invalidity of the claim.

That depends on what you think the relationship between ""proof"" and ""truth"" are.

I could prove the statement *""The Mona Lisa is beautiful""* by asking the opinions of a large sample of intelligent people (who would most likely agree with the statement). I could, in turn, draw the conclusion that the statement was ""true""....

I could say ""All swans are white"" and set about collecting a large sample of swans and test their ""whiteness"". I would collect a million white swans from across Europe and eventually draw the erroneous conclusion that the statement *""all swans are white""* was true...until I went to Australia and saw a black swan.

Additionally, laws of physics can be proven to be false under certain circumstances but they are not entirely abandoned. Newtonian liquids and non-newtonian liquids spring to mind. Your counter-argument would be *""These laws operate under different circumstances and you must take that into account""* but wouldn't that argument also apply to statements like *""reincarnation exists""*. If I said that reincarnation existed in a metaphorical and symbolic sense (which more Buddhists claim) and not a literal-physical sense, do I need to prove the symbolic value of reincaration to know that ""reincarnation exists""?

I don't think your account of ""truth"" and ""proof"" is adequate but maybe that is slightly digressed. I return to my original question:

Indeed Nixon's policies were, by almost any measure, more pro-tax and pro-labor than Clinton's or Obama's.

The South is thought of as having been the protector of slavery, motivated by a unique racism that persists today.  Overlooked are the economic pressures that in the past were lifted because of a threat of secession, the almost complete political division along geographic lines, and many other points that give a much more reasonable picture of what was actually happening in the pre-Civil War South.

People seem to have the impression that the South was a driving force behind perpetuating and expanding the practice of slavery in the 18th and 19th century world.  In reality slavery had been the main source of labor since before the first known civilizations began.  The resistance to ending it was uncertainty about what would happen, economically and culturally, without it.

People seem to think that the South was especially racist even though it is pretty clear that the general consensus of the time that white Europeans were superior to blacks.  It is partially why several Northern and Western states ended up with laws prohibiting blacks (not just slaves), not born in those states, from entering.  It was also why the the country Liberia was created after the Civil War.  Many hoped the freed slaves would go back to Africa rather than remain in American society as inferiors.

The idea that the South is more racist still persists, but if you go to any small Northern or Western town, more than 50 miles outside a major city, you will find all the racism that is supposedly indicative of the South.  The difference is that you won't find many black people there since the vast majority of them still live in the South.  This contributes a lot to the stereotype of Southern racism.  Black/white conflicts that can be pointed to as racially motivated don't happen very often in Vermont or Utah because there are hardly any black people in those states.  Now, there are some non-Southern cities where large black communities exist:  New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, for example.  All of those cities saw pretty much the same events (civil disobedience, marches, riots, etc.) as Southern cities during the civil rights era and a few brief periods since then.

I was going to go into some of what is usually ignored, but this is already longer than I intended it to be.  A couple of points are mentioned in the first paragraph and it would not be hard to find more from there.

I think the key phrase here is ""a unique racism"".  I believe you are quite correct here and elsewhere that white supremacism has been the defining attitude in terms of race relations between Europeans and their descendants, and everyone else, worldwide, since the beginning of the colonial era.  Its virulent and institutionalized persistence in the USA seems unique to me though.  More on that in a bit.

&gt; In reality slavery had been the main source of labor since before the first known civilizations began.

True, but race-based slavery without the reasonable hope of manumission and integration into society is a particularly cruel and uniquely American form of slavery.  By which I mean America in the hemispheric sense, as I am sure any supporter of Evo Morales would tell you, American race-based slavery is not only a black-white thing.

&gt; I haven't read a single source ever claiming Christianity were some kind of women's liberation
movement, nor that it in any way revolutionized or even slightly changed the fact that the woman was man's possession.

You should read more then. I'm not making as strong a claim as some of your text entails: I'm not claiming that Christianity is feminist in the modern sense, or that it upholds equality of men and women. My claim is weaker: that Christianity sets out, ideologically, a stronger position for women than there existed before in many societies where it was received (I'm mostly limiting my claims to Europe here because it's the history I know reasonably well.)

&gt; Au contraire, the Christian creation story and countless passages in the Old Testament cemented the inferior position of women. The Bible condones polygamy.
Abraham had several concubines. The Old Testament also describes in detail how to sell a woman, how to keep her, and how to deny her a long line of freedoms
available to men.

One of my points is that you shouldn't confuse the mythical aspects of a religion with the actual results it leads to. The fact that a religion has goddesses, for instance, has very little to do with the way it prescribes to treat women. The Tanach does not condone polygamy as such, or at least not unambiguously: this is a question still debated by Jewish legal minds today. Whether it does or not is secondary to the fact that Christianity institutionally was never accepting of polygamy. As I said, you need to separate more clearly between prescriptive aspects of a religion and other textual components.

&gt; In the New Testament, the chauvinist Paul keeps repeating how man is the head of the woman. Women are supposed to be subjugated, covered, modest and owned.

Sure, this is quite true, and in no way contradicts my point. There are different levels of opression, not only 1 and 0. It's not a boolean variable.

&gt; Your link describes how a couple also in pre-Christian times were interrogated as to both give their consent to union. Consent between marrying parties
was not a novelty brought by Christianity, and neither was it practiced much differently with Christianity than without. It was a business-deal. And the
woman was a trade-good. If you think she magically got free will with Christianity you are just being naive.

The difference is one I went over: the constitutive and central place of consent in the Christian institution of marriage. I'm sure many women got married by force in Christian societies, but I'm sure many people got murdered, stolen from, etc. It doesn't mean the religious institutions approved of either. Marriages could be anulled in Church courts due to all sorts of defects in consent: violence, intimidation, fear, deceit... So yes, the change does exist and is relevant, even if it isn't equivalent to the standards of today.

&gt; And your link talks alot about how homosexuality was regarded by religion. I know Christianity regards it a sin already. That's hardly a secret. You aren't
answering my question though. I wanted you to demonstrate that people were in fact practicing less homosexual behavior after the invention of Christianity,
than before (and how is that good for the woman again? I kind of don't understand that either, as women can be homosexual too).

I think this is quite simple. I've shown you sources which explain that male homosexuality was regarded by the dominant pre-christian societies of the time as acceptable or even desireable. I have shown you how this changed after Christian times. Is what you're claiming that social approval and legal sanction have no influence on people's actions whatsoever? Do you actually think that a world in which your friends would praise you for choosing a youth to love and a world in which you'd be burned for it would lead to an equal number of people engaging in the behaviour?

As to why male homosexuality is good for women, I went over it on a previous post on this very same thread.

&gt; The anti-male-homosexual stance of Christianity
tends to make men seek satisfaction through women, which increases the exchange value of the commodity they have at hand, if you catch my drift. Same thing
with prostitution: making marriage a precondition for sexual satisfaction augments the bargaining power of females, at least in the context we're speaking
of in which females had a higher burden from engaging in sex (pregnancy, child-birth, social oprobrium).

&gt; Of course I know you can't demonstrate such a thing, cause the only impact Christianity and its inhuman interpretation of nature had, was moving activities
underground. Not eradicating them.

Erradicating them? Surely not. But decreasing them? I'm reasonably sure it did. Fear of not being burned is a great motivator. Certainly some pre-christian activities like temple prostitution and institutionalized pederasty seemed to have been sharply reduced.

&gt; You seem to think Christianity improved life for women, yet you haven't showed a single piece of evidence for it other than your own wishful thinking.

What sort of evidence do you want? Many if not most early Christian converts were women. The juridical status of women before Christian courts was higher than before Roman or Greek courts. Etc. christianity probably became a reactionary force with regard to the status of women around the renaissance at the earliest, I'd say. It certainly is one now. But it wasn't one at its inception. Same as Islamic family law was, believe it or not, a relative advance over existing Arab custom.

&gt; The actual result it led to was 2000 years systematic oppression of women.

The question you should be asking here is: as opposed to what? Do you think, or have you any reason to believe, that Christianity as compared to pre-Christian religious institutions increased opression of women? There was systematic opression of women before Christianity and outside the Christian world, so I don't see how that can be the result of Christianity.

&gt; Religious institutions and the male clergy led the oppression of women. And in many places in the western world to this day, religious institutions are
the hardest places for women to get accepted as opposed to secular society.

The decontextualized quoting you did didn't refer to equality of men and women as a whole or to women being accepted inside religious institutions, but to consent of the woman being a necessary, central and constitutive element of the Christian institution of marriage. If you have something to argue against that, go ahead. Otherwise you're mixing up the issue, arguing with someone else. I'm clear on the fact women can't be priests on many churches, and even in some churches it's still taught today they should not seek power or employment outside the home. That's nothing to do with my point.

As to homosexuality: you may notice that I always clarified I was speaking of the Christian anti-male-homosexuality position. The Christian churches as far as I know never bothered too much until recently about female homosexuality, I'm not sure why (possibly didn't even think of it, they all being males). You think I'm naive about the power of societal pressure and laws to change behaviour set by human nature, I think you're naive about the purported unchangeability and permanence of human nature. Otherwise, but the number of males involved with other males in Athens, we'd have to have a lot more male homosexuals than we seem to in modern society.

&gt; Christian converts didn't necessarily have any choice. I come from a country that was in its entirety converted by violence. Believe in Christianity, or
be dead.

Sure, and entirely irrelevant to my point. Did you notice I spoke of early Christian converts? I'm referring here to the early Church, when it didn't have temporal power and it was often persecuted by the state. Basically the epoch before Constatine's change of policy. During this time Christians weren't converting anyone by the sword, and many women voluntarily joined. They may have been mistaken, but they probably thought they were getting a better deal at the time.

&gt; Edit: And I thought this whole time, that you defended the ""women's religion"" part of it. If you're not defending that, then sorry, but I'm just not sure

I completely disagree and I don't think this has been demonstrated either. Society changes, and it might well be that society changed regardless of the introduction of Christianity (which in its' OT form was pretty goddamn barbaric).

&gt;The question you should be asking here is: as opposed to what

I can imagine 100 alternatives, but it's a hypothetical thought experiment which is entirely useless. So I must stick to the one reality we've got, and in that reality, Christianity was used for oppression of women.

&gt;consent of the woman being a necessary, central and constitutive element of the Christian institution of marriage. 

Consent of the woman, or her father. In most cases, the latter had more to say than the former. In the cases the woman were allowed by her pater familias to make her own decisions, I don't see any pattern of this freedom being any more prevalent in Christianity than any other religion. Culture had a far bigger impact here than religion (and remember that at least here in Europe most people remained multi-religious and still are today, keeping their old gods alongside the Christian god).

&gt;I know never bothered too much until recently about female homosexuality, I'm not sure why

Cause females to Christianity are ""a womb"" and nothing else. We don't matter.

On homosexuality, this is a pattern found in several hundred animal species in pretty consistent numbers. In most species, about 5-10% of the total population display homosexual behavior. Same for humans. This is genetic, and not cultural. 

For the wealthy Romans and Greeks in a very short period of time, man-on-boy love was a an ideal of culture (it was considered the purest form of love), but that was hardly engulfing world society as a whole. 

Christianity's main goal with strict polygamy was to control every aspect of human life, and to restrict sex, emotion, and anything else that took focus away from the spiritual realm. It wasn't to liberate women. 

Some women might have converted (perhaps cause their husbands did), but this is what they converted to:

[""From the early patristic age, the offices of teacher and sacramental minister were reserved for men throughout most of the church in the East and West.[13] Tertullian, the second century Latin father, wrote that ""It is not permitted to a woman to speak in church. Neither may she teach, baptize, offer, nor claim for herself any function proper to a man, least of all the sacerdotal office"" (On the Veiling of Virgins). The Alexandrian father Origen argued in his commentary on 1 Corinthians 14:34, 35 that female prophets never spoke publicly in the assembly.[13] Similarly, Epiphanius of Salamis claimed that ""Never from the beginning of the world has a woman served God as priest"" (Against the heresies)."" ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Christianity)

So whatever their motive, they were obviously prepared to be subjugated in every religious matter.

&gt; My argument can be summarized in very few words: Christianity when it was introduced reformed social institutions, customs and laws in a way that entailed modest but not irrelevant advances for the position of women. That's it in a nutshell.

I completely disagree with this statement. I believe Christianity systemized oppression of women in large parts of the world that didn't previously have a monotheistic father figure to beat them over the head with, and forced both men and women into very narrow and unfree relations that Christians still try to shove down people's throats to this very day.

,0,2,t5_2qh2p,2,blackstar9000,"A few general points:

&gt; A moral thing has always been the things that benefit the society and keep it harmonious.

That's getting it backwards.  The morals that survive tend to be those that benefit the sort of societies in which they're practiced.  Not because societies necessarily have any mechanism that prevents the institution of retrogressive morals, but because societies cursed with retrogressive morals tend to collapse, taking with them their culture, including their morals.

Or maybe the argument you're attempting to make is that, no matter what we may judge to be moral, the actual, objective moral thing will be whatever's best for society.  But that too seems backwards.  After all, some people could argue that our society is better off excluding certain groups of people, or that we're best served by sanctioning the torture of anyone who could alert us to threats against our society.  Sam Harris has demonstrated the slipperiness of the latter sort of argument.  Does a given moral claim's propensity towards furthering the survival of a society necessarily make it moral?  No, because ultimately morality is a supervening level of judgment.  We use morality not only to judge the propriety of behavior within a society, but also to judge the society itself.  And ultimately we may say, any society that seems to justify certain forms of behavior (slavery, torture, expansionism) as a requirement for its survival is, itself, immoral.

&gt; Basic things that are thought to be moral or immoral are very universal in all societies. Stealing, lying or killing is very universally forbidden as they always affect negatively the smooth working of the community.

I'm always skeptical of claims concerning so called universal morals.  For example, in some Islamic societies there's a doctrine sanctioning lying if it's necessary to defend against religious persecution.  In Roman-era Germanic societies, killing wasn't murder so long as you declared your intent to do so beforehand and took credit for the killing afterward.  Incest was formerly considered a universal taboo, but it's since been found common in certain cultures, and besides, what counts as incest differs from culture to culture.

&gt; Followers of Islam or Christianity have never had such moral qualms, but through centuries the followers of these faiths have actively been encouraged to attack those who don’t share same religious tradition.

That's a gross generalization, and doesn't bear up under scrutiny.  Both Christians and Jews fared well in Moorish Spain, for example, and in contemporary societies tolerance for minority religious traditions by the religious majority of any given region is obviously the rule rather than the exception, or we'd all be embroiled in constant factional religious violence.  Both [Christianity](http://www.religioustolerance.org/tol_bibl.htm) and [Islam](http://www.answering-islam.org/Hahn/mappe.html) provide scriptural support for toleration, and if Judaism does not then we can at least count it as historically fortuitous that they have almost never turned to violence as a means of converting others.

&gt; The democratic legislative process creates legislation and juridical system sees to it that it is obeyed.

This makes no distinction between morality and legality, but there are important differences.  Legality is more closely associated with the maintenance of society, and any laws no directly related to that purpose will tend towards injustice.  The scope of morality is different -- for example, while it may be a legal obligation not to park next to a curb that's been painted yellow or red, it's certainly not a moral obligation.  And morality may extend beyond legality -- that it's not illegal to lie to your wife about going out drinking with your buddies, most people would consider it immoral.  Personally, I'd argue that the similarities between a society's legal and moral codes should ideally be a matter of coincidence or overlap, not direct relationship.

&gt; Sam Harris has rightly pointed out that there is no more criminality in the almost atheistic countries of the Northern Europe than there is in the on the surface very Christian Southern European countries.

This harks back to the difference between legality and morality.  If legality is not tantamount to morality, then the lack of criminality in a predominantly atheist country would not necessarily serve as an index of how moral its citizens are.  After all, legal curbs would remain operative -- people would still be penalized for criminal activity.  Even if an atheist in such a country saw nothing particularly wrong with killing his neighbor, he would likely refrain for fear of incurring the legal penalty.  The real test would be how often they conform to morals that aren't reproduced by the law.

&gt; Richard Dawkins for his part has pointed out that a situation where only the fear of punishment after death prevents a human being from acting badly is in fact morally corrupt.

Again, referring back to the equation of legality and morality, couldn't the same be said of a situation where only fear of punishment *before* death?  The real question, I suppose, is that of how often we're presented with situations in which some sort of personal negative consequence isn't at least implied.  In other words, how often are any of us truly capable of behaving morally, by the standard Dawkins gives us?

we’re only three weeks into it! If you will recall, 2008 was a pretty bad year for the
banking sector. For example, the shares of Citigroup, Bank of America, and the Royal
Bank of Scotland fell 77%, 66%, and 92%, respectively, in 2008. So far this year
(remember, this is only three weeks) the same stocks are already down 50%, 55%, and
74%, respectively. Like we said, 2009 has already been a pretty bad year! For as bad
as 2008 was, 2009 promises to be a whole lot worse. The problem isn’t just the banking
system anymore. The problem is the banking system and everything else. This year, the
financial crisis of yesteryear is morphing into an altogether different animal. It’s
morphing into a financial crisis that has an economic crisis layered on top of it. In fact, to
call the current environment an economic crisis is likely understating the situation. What
we really have is a global economic catastrophe. One where weakness only begets
more weakness, causing a vicious circle that is proving nigh impossible to reverse in
spite of all the world’s financial, economic, and political brain trust throwing everything
they have, including the kitchen sink, at the problem.
In our last article, “Surviving the Depression”, we mentioned how the world is witnessing
depression-sized declines in economic activity. We mentioned how auto sales in the US
were down almost 40%. How housing starts were down almost 50%. How industrial
production is falling off a cliff, with each month worse than the last. How jobless claims
are at multi-decade highs. How consumer confidence is at multi-decade lows. How the
company surveys we follow are showing dramatic declines across the board in
economic activity. We challenged the idea that this is a run-of-the-mill, minus-low-singledigit
recession and we characterized this Depression (there is no other way to describe
it) as “global, pervasive, and deep”.
In the month since we wrote that article, the data points have only gotten worse, and
they will likely have gotten worse still by the time you read this article. US housing starts
fell a further 15.5% in December to 550,000, the lowest on record. US industrial
production fell a further 2.2% in December, to a 7.8% year-over-year decline. If you
think that’s shocking try this on for size: European industrial orders (a leading indicator
of industrial production) are down 26% year-over-year, the largest decline on record. Or
how about Japanese exports plunging 35% in December – shocking, isn’t it? Global
steel production was reported to be down 24% in December. All over the world,
dramatic rates of decline in economic activity are being reported. The most disturbing
developments have been in employment, which took a marked turn for the worse thus
far this year. US jobless claims are now running almost 600,000 per week. You don’t
want to annualize that number, but you may have to. Layoff announcements have been
coming fast and furious since the beginning of the year. If we were to list them all here it
would take several pages. We are seeing dozens of layoff announcements on the news
each and every day. On Monday alone there were lay off announcements totaling
70,000 workers. There isn’t a single industry we can think of that is unscathed. A few
examples: Circuit City (retail) laying off 30,000. Citigroup (banking) is planning to lay off
52,000 over the next few months. Microsoft and Intel (computers) laying off 5,000 and

Far from it: they have this thing with Freemasons (and Hospitals), but most locals assume it's a marketing gimmick. The magazine market targets 'notable': local, conservative elite — but calling them anything more would be excessive. They were among the several magazine that, a few weeks after the events, echoed a Messian (a senior, out of the mainstream, rather left-wing, journalist)'s book claiming that no plane crashed in the Pentagon — rather critically, but that was a blunt argument to have at that time. Since, that thesis has been ridiculed, albeit a lack of evidence. Some Truthers are annoying, but most simply find that too many elements are missing, and want to know more.

I personally think that any data on what impact (or temperature) would make such towers collapse need to be revised, if not for political reasons, to insure other similar construction stand. Same for the Pentagon: you don't 'waste' such a crash without investigating how a plane can damage a construction.

Aw, c'mon.  We had a revolution and a civil war.  What's Iceland had?

Seriously, though, do you really thing history plays that much of a role in political and economic choices, bouncing back and forth?

Personally, (and I admit that I'm certainly guessing here myself, and that's it's easy to armchair historian and come up with all sorts of nonsense) I kind of think that it has more to do with what happened at the end of the age of aristocracy.  When Europe created her modern economies and governments, the movement was reparationist, trying to get back the disproportionally-allocated resources from the aristocracy.  It was only through constant effort that the aristocracies were pulled apart (France) or brought down to the level of the common man (the UK).  When the United States created *her* economy and government, sentiment was *very* anti-classist...but it amounted mostly to wanting an aristocracy to never *arise*, so that we could earn our own way without anyone taking anything from us.  There wasn't incredible wealth to *get* from anyone anywhere -- almost everyone was involved with farming.  So our national sentiment and direction was built up around not allowing an aristocracy to form -- the US has a bit more of a skepticism about government being created and what it might take from people than does Europe.

I don't see why you'd call the United States [fascist](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Fascism).  The term is quite general and broadly used, but Wikipedia has the following:

&gt;Fascism is an authoritarian 

The United States is one of the more *anti*-authoritarian countries out there.

&gt;nationalist

Yes, the US is nationalist, very much so during Bush.

&gt;ideology focused on solving economic, political, and social problems that its supporters see as causing national decline or decadence.[1][2][3][4]

Eh...I don't really see that.  The closest thing to that would probably be social conservativism.

&gt;Fascists aim to create a single-party state in which the government is led by a dictator who seeks unity by requiring individuals to subordinate self-interest to the collective interest of the nation or a race.[5][6][7]

Certainly not.  Our President doesn't have a recall vote, but he's no dictator.

&gt;Fascist governments permanently forbid and suppress all criticism and opposition to the government and the fascist movement.[8]

No.  The United States is very open to political criticism.

&gt;Fascist movements oppose any ideology or political system that gives direct political power to people as individuals rather than as a collective through the state (liberalism, democracy, individualism); that is deemed detrimental to national identity and unity (class conflict, communism, internationalism, laissez-faire capitalism); that protects and enhances the power of ""weak"" people rather than promoting ""strong"" people (egalitarianism); that may oppose major changes to institutions and cultural values that it proposes (conservatism) and that undermine the military strength and military ambitions of the nation (pacifism).[9][10][11] [12][13][14][15][16][17][18]

Most of that really, really doesn't fit.  Bush pushed some socially conservative values and was militarily aggressive, but it is hardly anti-individualist or anti-laissez-faire or anti-democratic.

&gt;Fascist movements promote violent conflict between nations, political factions, races, and other groups of people as part of a social Darwinist and militarist view that conflict is a natural process and a part of evolution.

Mmmmf.  Maybe under Bush, with ""Islamofascism"".  The Cold War would qualify, I guess, and [Manifest Destiny](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Manifest_destiny), if one goes back far enough.

,0,2,t5_2qgzg,2,[deleted],"About a year ago, I was very, VERY enthusiastic about Austrian Economics, and wanted an investment advisor who uses it to help in making my savings survive the coming troubles. Because IF the ABCT is true, it has a lot of clear predictions f.e. in a recession capital goods will fall earlier and bigger than consumer goods and at the next boom capital goods will gain more than consumer goods etc. etc. and I figure an advisor can use the theory and break it up to exact investment advices.

I found Peter Schiff and Mark Skousen. 

I chose Mark Skousen because somehow looked like a more professional guy, but strangely, he was generally bullish or level-ish, he cautiously but trusted the Fed,  etc. Very strange for an AE guy to say... So I dropped my subscription after he was proven wrong.

Meanwhile Peter Schiff always predicted doom, gloom and apocalypse. And his suggestion was to invest into Asian stocks. Well, guess what, Asian stocks didn't perform that well either. Everybody knows Asia is export-driven, driven by American, British and European consumption. 

So, I'm at the moment out of advisors I'd trust. I think ABCT is generally correct, because besiders the usual aprioristic proofs, Lachmann more or less proved it empirically too. It's predictive power is fairly reliable and that's what counts. 

But apparently it doesn't have enough predictive power to really, REALLY be able to tell exactly what will happen and when. 

Nothing else has either, AFAIK, so at the end of the day it seems investment is back to guesswork. Sigh. But I don't even want to be rich, I just don't want to lose what I have against inflation.

,0,1,t5_2qh63,1,generic_handle,"&gt;From what I can gather, Ron seems to be more open to gay/ lesbian and drug reformation than Obama will ever be.  Obama is a big government shill who wants to do nothing but destroy personal liberties.

That's oversimplified and misleading, IMHO.  In *practical terms*, yes, Ron Paul would probably produce more alteration in drug law than Obama would, but I'm not sure that that means that he'd be a fan of the same, just that he wouldn't prevent it.

Gay/Lesbian marriage would likely be the same under Paul or Obama.  Obama takes what looks like a single marriage standard across the states (as he's opposed to DoMA), is also opposed to same-sex marriage, but also is opposed to having a federal marriage amendment to ban same-sex marriage.  As far as I can tell, that would pretty much be the status quo.  Ron Paul is opposed to the federal marriage amendment and in favor of DoMA, which would result in a varying marriage standard across the states.  In practice, my guess is that that would wind up pretty much being the same thing (especially as I doubt that DoMA actually has any effect other than making explicit what courts would probably rule anyway).

I think that the claim that Obama is a ""big government shill"" is pretty loaded.  He's certainly a fan of more federal spending than Paul, but then, so was every other Presidential candidate.  I don't think that he wants to ""destroy personal liberties"", either.

&gt;I just don’t get why anyone would be on the Obama bandwagon, he can hardly speak a sentence without uttering multiple fillers within each thought, and then everyone calls him a great rhetorical speaker.

He's young-looking, handsome, has a smooth-sounding voice.  Paul has a thin voice and looks old.  I like Paul, but aside from maybe the ""kindly old grandfather"" image, he just isn't plain as sellable via appearances.

&gt;This guy is one of the biggest puppets ever set up, and now he has everyone wanting to have their cake and eat it to.

I don't think that Obama is a puppet.

Nor do I think that he's a radical liberal (as the GOP ads would have it) *or* anywhere near as revolutionary as his campaign made him out to be or likely to change as many things.  He's a fairly mainstream centrist Democrat, honestly.  There are very few policies that he's advocated that really drastically differed from Hillary Clinton's.

I wish Paul could have made it in, but he *did* make a good run, did some important coalition-building -- the idea that third parties can present a united front is valuable, and put some important ideas out there.  I kinda think of him as acting like the canary in the mine for a number of other politicians.  If Paul can go out and say that Policy X is a good idea and not get beaten to a bloody pulp on the political stage for it, then maybe it's okay to go ahead and say things like that.  He criticized the US-Israeli relationship, *strongly* condemned the Bush-era wars even when they were starting out (if you remember, there were few Democrats who were willing to do so and no Republicans, certainly not in the kind of terms he used), and a number of civil liberties infringements.

Finally, he took a more intellectual approach to politics that sort of seems to me to have gone missing.  You may not agree with him, but arguing about the merits of monetary policy or actually bringing up the *long term consequences* of our foreign policy was something that was in very short supply during the race.  When you've heard nothing but simple jingoism for the past eight years and then right next to McCain saying ""I don't want to fly with a Muslim -- they only want one-way tickets"" to have him launch into an argument about our historical foreign policy was a relief.  It reminds people that we really can aspire to something better.  Obama avoided the jingoism, but has a bad habit of going for rather empty warm-and-fuzzy statements (which I guess I can't fault him for -- Bill Clinton did the same thing often enough, and he was quite popular).

Finally, I can certainly raise some criticisms of Paul, even if I really like the guy.  I agree with most of the conclusions of Austrian economics, which Paul is a fan of, but I'm skeptical of its reasoning.  Paul had plenty of goals -- ambitious ones -- but was weak on practical, point-by-point steps for reaching those.  Eliminate the DEA?  Okay.  Now tell us how you intend to transition to that -- since it was created in the early 1970s, the Drug Enforcement Administration's taken on the role that normally state police forces would handle.  That's a real, major, logistical issue, and if you seriously promote it, you're going to have your hands full -- it would involve a lot of redelegation of responsibilities  and major policy changes.  The same goes for hard currency, and the other federal police forces that he wants to phase out (ATF, FBI).  Do these become state agencies, private companies that provide forensics services to police, what?  Okay, you've made an argument that there are real inflationary concerns associated with fiat currency.  Now tell me how we can move to a hard currency, something that resolves those.  Are you going to back every existing dollar?  That'd be phenomenally expensive.  Are you going to back new dollars?  If these are too major to accomplish in one term, give me some realistic proposals.  Even if you don't win, someone can take that policy and refine it and adopt it, if it's been hammered on, but you need to have concrete policy proposals to criticize to get somewhere.  It's concrete policy that gets adopted and compared, not goals.

I had real practical concerns about at least two issues: first, phasing out the FCC -- I don't think that the FCC can honestly be handled at the state level.  It deals with a resource that simply ignores state boundaries.  I'm not sure how frequency allocation is handled in Europe, but I imagine that even if there are agencies in each country, they probably work as more or less one European agency to deal with the problem.  Second, Paul wants both no international treaties requiring free trade *and* to have low tariffs.  That might be more ideologically pure to free markets, but I'm not convinced that it's *practically* more useful.  Bill Clinton created a large number of free trade agreements that are a pain in the butt to break (despite complaints from labor), and as a result, it's difficult for the country to shift away from a free-trade environment with at least some countries (when Bush tried with steel, it resulted in international outcry).  That might be more pragmatically effective at ensuring free trade.  I understand his concerns about creeping centralization of power, but I think that avoiding protectionism is more important.",1234022770,t1_c07j2hu,0,True,Libertarian,t1_c07j0tq,False,True,,t3_7vj0p,c07j2hu,1425921343,0,

Don't be stupid. Again, it would be because they see Israel as the greater aggressor (either because they naturally side with Arabs or because they have rationally come to the position that Israel is being the greater aggressor - probably a mix of the two).

&gt;you honestly saying that the Gazans don't protest Hamas out of fear of Israel?

It was a rhetorical device initially, but yes, I do think it's a factor - not the entirety, fear of Hamas and just the the plan day to day struggle of surviving getting food and water are probably more significant. And there would be a significant emotional connection to Hamas as the perceived power that is fighting against a persecutor.

&gt;those Gazans and Palestinians and Arabs strongly support Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians

Sure, as I said immediately above - now ask your self why. And be honest about it, it is not just because Arabs naturally hate Jews - this is a new thing that has resulted from Israeli behaviour.

&gt;So 3,000 war crimes by Hamas last year are not worthy of protest.

I didn't say that.

&gt;Israel's response, though, is seen by all as horrible.

Remove the word response and replace it with actions and you have a more honest statement. Yes, Israel's actions are in the main justifiably seen as horrible.

&gt;Perhaps this is part of why Israel sees itself as isolated and sees that it has to act this way. Clearly the world does not care for the lives of Israeli civilians.

Victimhood is getting boring from one of the greatest military powers on Earth.

As far as you drivel about racism, yes there is the notion of the Ummah of all Islam, but as I've restated above there is not necessarily any connection between non-Gazan Arabs and Gaza, so why would those people feel responsible for the actions of Hamas enough to protest against them. My point has been that Jews, often in my experience, do feel a sense of connection and responsibility for Israel even if they do not live there and are not citizens.

If you've been employed at your job for a long time, you could ask if they'd be open to letting you take a month out.  The worst they can do is say no.  There's no need to talk about how much you hate your life/job - just say that you're looking for an opportunity to broaden your horizons and gain more life experience.  If they say yes, score, you'll have a job to come back to if it turns out that travelling isn't for you.  If they say no, fuck it, quit and find something new when you get back.  (Travelling has to be at least a little bit about irresponsibility :) )   
Pick somewhere that isn't tooooo far away from the USA, culturally, for your first trip.  If you've never left your town before and you fly into Mumbai you're going to shit yourself (probably literally after a few meals haha) and want to come home.   Europe is much more expensive than asia, obviously, but at least it's more culturally close to the states.  Then again, maybe I'm under estimating you... it's just something to consider.     
You could also look into some kind of ""program"" so you're not completely on your own on the other side of the world.  There are heaps of programs to do with volunteering abroad.  You can teach English after a short course.  Google TEFL (teaching english as a foreign language) for information on that.  Or you could do something like building orphanages or conservation work if you're more into the physical labour.  Volunteering abroad can be expensive... but it's for a good cause so you can try writing to companies asking them to sponsor you, or have sponsored fund raisers?    
About working in Paris/europe in general... unless you want to do it illegally, you will run into a lot of problems with visas.  Also, I have a sneaking suspicion you'll quickly discover that working long hours in a totally shitty job in Paris, is no more exciting than working your current job in the states.  I notice you mentioned IT skills... is there anything you could do to be working remotely?  You have to go absolute miles out of your way to find somewhere that doesn't have internet these days.  If there's a bus stop, there's an internet café (it might be sharing 56k between 8 computers... but it's something) so if you can wangle a telecommuting job somehow, you can live the dream.    
You could also try www.bunac.org, who organise work abroad programs and will help you with visas.  There are restrictions for some countries (like needing to be a student) but countries such as Australia are fairly easy to get visas for.   
Lastly... just cause you mentioned this in your post - DON'T let language barriers be a reason not to go travelling.  Pretty much everywhere has some people that speak English.  DO make an effort though, learn the basics like hello, goodbye, thank you, please, how much etc for anywhere you go because people will appreciate it.

It's kind of like the fact that if someone says ""classical music"", one almost automatically thinks of European music.  A child learning under this curriculum can have the concept that no one else has made contributions to music or that the only ""worthy"" music is Eurocentric music if care is not taken to demonstrate the value of other types.  Black History Month is an attempt to address this issue by having intent focus on the accomplishments of Black people.

I worked for a small telephone company, specializing in discount international calling cards (the no-brand ones you buy from Abu at the local corner store; though they also has commercial, residential and wholesale revenue streams). We used A, B, C and D for all kinds of stupid crap that isn't priority related.

Anyways, one of the incredibly stupid things they did was assign 'D' to mean: ""Call NOC"". The idea was that field techs could use their portable to call in to the NOC from any customer location without having to remember the number (the portables used by field techs had 0-9 and A-D). This was only needed in a pinch obviously (it is very rare for a field tech to need to talk to the NOC directly).

Anyway, one of the customers had attached a very old AT&amp;T touch-tone phone to the network with the A, B, C, and D buttons. Somehow the customer realized what ""D"" did. Now we're a pretty competitive company, but we had pretty limited switching technology (basically just a Veraz soft switch). The Veraz couldn't do least-cost-routing out of the box. Instead, during peak hours, the NOC would call around to various carriers in real-time and try to negotiate the cheapest rates.

Picture a three-guy trading floor. They would call a carrier, negotiate a price and QOS guarantee, watch the call supervision monitors very closely to check for QOS issues on a trunk, and based on QOS and pricing, manually move trunks in and out of route by issuing SQL commands against the Veraz's Oracle database.

This is a high-stress, yelling into your phone while pacing in your cubical late at night typing commands as fast as your fingers can move job. This is the kind of job where missing a call can cost the company millions. And its just you and two other guys alone all night long. Generally the work is divided up: one guy makes the calls, another guy runs and analyzes CSM/ASR reports, while the other enters commands into the Veraz database to maintain the carrier trunk routing tables.

Now, this smart-ass customer, decides to mess around with his new-found-toy during our busiest night of the year (Sunday night between 7p-1a EST the week before thanksgiving). This ass-hat calls the NOC over and over and over all night long. I mean, literally D-hangup-D-hangup-D-hangup. It was so bad that the NOC couldn't even make an outgoing call half the time and answering incoming calls from carriers was useless (you'd just get hung up on).

Now, this sounds really funny right? Well this was a cut-throat telecom start-up during the dotcom bubble burst, and this was the most lucrative night of the year. In fact, this one night makes or breaks the entire year. Tens-of-millions of dollars worth of calls are routed through this network during this one shift.

On top of that, there are regulatory issues related to QOS minimums that must be met. This means that calls to Haiti have to have an answer supervision rate of at least 84%, calls to Canada have to have guaranteed routing (e.g. we can't give callers in the US ""No circuits"" messages unless there really isn't any (calls the Mexico are often dropped with ""No circuits"" when we just can't find a trunk cheap enough to make money on the call). The cost of regulatory violations can be VERY hefty. There are per-incident fines in the thousands in some cases. With a million calls are made in one night, the potential for disaster is quite real.

Anyway, while this ass hat was DOS-ing the NOC, a few things happened. First, Telecom Italia decides, ""fuck it, calls to Mexico City now cost 0.0023 cents per minute to terminate instead of 0.0019"" (or whatever). Basically a price hike that normally gets a carrier taken out of route entirely (or at least we call them and negotiate a cheaper price based on some trade-of-traffic deal or something). Unfortunately, we miss the call warning of the price change. So now 15% of our calls are being terminated way over the expected price. Then, NovaTel looses a fiber trunk to Europe, and has to move all traffic through a backup trunk. But we miss those calls and suddenly we loose half the world. The ASR report takes about 2 minutes to propagate the data telling the guys what just happened because the damn thing is a PHP app that queries a MySQL server which is asynchronously populated by a cron job written in perl that is so fucking slow its unbelievable. So for two minutes the NOC has no idea that we just committed an international trade violation and lost a couple million dollars in revenue. And best of all, they have no idea what trunk NovaTel has switched traffic to. So the NOC panics and switches all of Europe over to a VERY expensive Qwest trunk (knowingly but reluctantly).

In the meantime, one of the guys, no shit, got in his car, drove across Ft Lauderdale to the office in Hollywood, took and elevator to the 15th floor, to look up his supervisors number and call him. The guy literally didn't know his supervisors phone number. Now, you'd think while he was there, he'd be bright enough to make some calls to some European carriers at least. But this guys decides its best just to go back down to his car, drive across Ft Lauderdale again back to the NOC. Meanwhile, it takes his supervisor more than two hours to get ready and drive from fucking Naples, on the other side of the state.

Now, remember the 0.0023 that Telecom Italia is charging? Funny thing happens when you leave a trunk on the top of the routing list to a major destination too long without answering their warning calls. They exploited to opportunity to go ahead and make another increase, this time to 0.0064 or some-such price that is ridiculously high. Qwest charges less than a quarter that to terminate a call across an ocean.

So two hours goes by before the sup shows up. By now, this has been doing on for half the shift (4 hours or so). The D-hangup-D-hangups are still going on. Probably automated. The sup opens a console to the Veraz's Oracle database, and issues one query:

DELETE FROM TRUNK_CLLI_ROUTE WHERE DEST_LATA LIKE 'D%';

LOL! Calls stopped immediately. The four of them called every carrier to get status and cost updates. The damage was totaled up in MS Excel by the sup (who was the CTO) and emailed out to all of IT by morning as an FYI. We had to make 5M that night to break even for the year (we were already in the red). We expected to make closer to 50M. We actually made about -30M. Let me write that out for you: One ass-hat residential customer with a 20yo telephone with four extra buttons did thirty million dollars in damages in less than one night.

Anyways, that's how the company went bankrupt in late 2001 and about 6000 or so people in the Ft Lauderdale area all got laid off. :(",1234188013,t1_c07k5nn,0,False,programming,t1_c07k09i,False,True,,t3_7vvti,c07k5nn,1425921917,0,

The American fear of everything with the prefix ""social"" is just an echo from 50s communist paranoia. Socialism and communism is no threat to the free countries of the western world anymore, seriously, have they worked anywhere? at any time? 

The free market has shown itself superior time after time, when we get a cris, we call it a stock-crash and everything regulates itself after å few year. When statist and rigid countries have crisis, they cause revolts and great sufferings. 

The free market og democracy is the economic and political version of darwinism, its a self-regulating mechanism. Communism is like Intelligent design ;-) in every way, instead of letting society align itself based on needs and peoples own desire, the leaders try to design the optimal solution. The result? Historically, not very good.

That being said, there are plenty of European social programs that have proven themselves successful, and a couple of them, the verdict is not still out, but if you do not dare testing different approches within the frame of the free market, your society will surely not improve.

I am for small-goverment, and I would rather have a goverment that has a wide role in its responsibility and caring of its citizen, but stays small, rather than a big goverment that does not deliver any social programs.

Sometimes I feel the US-govement is the worst of two worlds in this respect. Its big, and yet it delivers little value to its citizens. And it seems that your welfare programs do little more than keep people in welfare programs. The European idea is to care for you between jobs, yet in the US, it seems that many live on the welfare check (as some people do in Europe as well), but in the US, it seems that the program is almost trapping whole minorities in their ghettos. But thats from outside looking in. 

It is possible to both dismantle the size of goverment, lower the taxes and start social programs. Just look at what Irland did in the 90s. Do not let yourself get caught in the retoric that you cannot have economic growth with social programs, and you cannot have social programs without a big goverment.

How about private health insurance vs. medicare?  Insurance is a free market of competing corporations, and medicare is a government monopoly, and yet medicare's overhead to deliver the same services is a fraction of what insurance companies cost.  Why?  Mostly because medicare doesn't pay 1/3rd of its income out for advertising and obscene executive salaries.  Not only is it more expensive, but the sheer waste and habit of cheating customers out of their benefits until the companies have to be sued is immoral, too.  A government department doesn't have the same profit motive to try to cheat people out of benefits, and so they tend to serve people a lot better in that regard.

Then there's the problem if high barrier cost of entry to many of the industries you're discussing.  Think about the investment required to start up a water company, it's prohibitive.  You end up with a de-facto monopoly, where one company can raise the price (water, electric, fire service, etc) way beyond what it costs and still be below a profit incentive point sufficient to make it worth the while of a second company to enter the market to compete.

The libertarian kool-aid would have you believe that private corporations are always more efficient than governments, but reality isn't a theoretical free market model.  There are good reasons for why some industries have come to be public services over time in virtually all areas of the world, a truly overwhelming precedent in a vast number of dramatically different societies and cultures.  

As for moving power to states, that doesn't solve the problem you complained about, with your elected representatives doing things you don't like.  They'd just be state representatives instead.  

Without any government at all you wind up in a state of nature; marauding warlords like those in the dark age periods of Europe, the warring states periods of China or Japan, or modern day Somalia, Congo, Sri Lanka, and even the drug lord slums and provinces of Brazil and Columbia.  They operate in armed, organized and totally ruthless bands more than capable of overwhelming any local militia and then raping their wives and recruiting their children after slaughtering the militia members.

The economics of a non-governmental situation are similarly depressing.  The gap between the haves and the have-nots widens even more dramatically than a situation with no income tax or labor regulation.  It's just a bad scene.

This is why it was always important that all the states within the union were legislatively distinct.  Now we have more than a century of federal encroach.

Consider this: in 1900 you could travel clear across Europe as far as the Russian border without any form of identification.

Even the most despotic European kings had a hard time extracting more than 10-15% of their nation's output, because they lacked modern central banking and mass media.  

Or consider that private banks existed in Europe for over 600 years before states started trying to control and regulate them.  Stock markets are almost as old.  

Or consider that European warfare prior to the advent of mass media consisted mostly of trying to keep your conscripts from running away.  Most common people did not self-identify with their states, and rightly viewed squabbles between kings as ""not my problem"".  

My point is that from the Enlightenment to World War I, Europe rode an incredible upward curve in terms of wealth, education, technology, and liberty.

&gt; Obviously not all religions can be true because they have different and even conflicting stories

Each of us has a very limited experience of our universe.  The classic analogy is two blind men examining an elephant, one at its head and one at its tail.  The two blind men might have very different descriptions of an elephant, indeed, those descriptions might even be contradictory.

If you consider mythology as humanity's attempt to understand the world around it, then it is not so hard to see both the Wind Spirit of the Bear and the Angels of a Christian God as representing truth.

&gt; you yourself have yet to quote sources proving the statement that religion has never caused wars

Um, I don't need to appeal to authority.  I cited specific examples: the crusades, 9/11, and the USSR.  There are much, much, better sources for your argument than the one you linked to.

&gt; We, the American people were attacked by a radical group of Muslims who believe that we are barbaric. Their reasons for this were religion based.  We, the US, broadcast obscene music videos, promote gay rights, and allow woman to come out in public, wear what they would like to, and exercise voting rights.

Really?  Why didn't they attack Europe, which is more pro-gay, more tolerant of obscenity on TV, etc?  Bin Laden himself explained why they did it: to protest US military bases in Saudi Arabia and our support of Israel.  That they did it because ""they hate our way of life"" is propaganda crap Bush spoon fed his simpleton followers.

Tell me, why did they attack our financial center instead of a religious target, like the Vatican?  It wasn't about religion, it was about America's tampering with Middle Eastern affairs.  You really seem way too bright to buy into Rovian rhetoric for the redneck masses.

,0,0,t5_2cneq,0,api,"I did some googling and found conflicting information: on one hand, income mobility seems to be higher in Europe. On the other hand, the ability to accumulate wealth seems to be lower.

I think the explanation is in the two sides of the Euro-style socialist coin.

On one hand, I think the income mobility is explained by the ready availability of great free education and infrastructure. If you want to better yourself, the means are handed to you. It's easy there to improve your earning potential.

On the other hand, the difficulty of actually accumulating wealth beyond a certain point is a pretty obvious side-effect of the progressive tax system. While you can increase your earning potential easily, the government just takes more and more of it.

So I stand by my original statement. There is a *glass ceiling* that it's very, very hard to move beyond. This has important social consequences: it means that while there might be easy class mobility up to middle class and some class mobility into upper-middle class, there is very little mobility up at the top where the air is thin. So you do have a caste system: you are either super-rich, or you are everyone else. The caste system is enforced by the tax system. If you're already rich, you can afford to pay high taxes. If you aren't, the taxes prevent you from ever getting there.

To some extent I view class mobility into the topmost brackets as the most important. Those are the brackets with the most influence, so if nobody ever gets there by their bootstraps it means new ideas never make it up there.

I also tend to view *any* kind of caste system as inherently offensive... almost to the extent of viewing its mere existence as a crime against humanity. I'd rather suffer the ups and downs of a more free market system with everyone else than live on a comfortable plantation... almost simply for the principle of the matter. The existence of a nobility is an offense against humanity.

,0,1,t5_2cneq,1,808140,"&gt;I think it's naive to believe that most every developed country's insistence on subsidizing local farming is really rooted in politicians pandering for farmers' votes.

It's not pandering for farmer's votes.  It's the very powerful and very wealthy agricultural lobby, which buys representatives in congress and its equivalents abroad; those representatives then use fear-mongering to convince the people that allowing the developing world an equal playing field would some how harm American/European independence and sovereignty.  (Usually this takes the form of ""we need to be able to grow our own food!  What if everyone in the world refuses to sell us food?"")

&gt;Well, whatever the reason, it's unlikely to go away (btw, ever heard of the local food movement?), so how should the developing countries deal with this?

I think developing countries are essentially powerless to really effect any change themselves.  Reducing protectionism in the developed world is really the only way, as I see it, to bring true wealth to the developing world.  Unfortunately, a relatively large number of people in the developed world seem to want expressly the opposite, lobbying instead for protectionist measures that force them to pay more for locally-produced goods and deprive people able and willing to do the work the opportunity to do so.

The thing that I find strange about this is that protectionism tends to most frequently be championed by the left, when in my experience people on the left are more likely to say that they want to help the poor than people on the right are (I would consider myself to be rather far on the left, for what it's worth).

I think some of this is due to very intelligent manipulation of public opinion by entrenched interests hostile to fair competition.  A good example is the fair trade movement -- it's an easy sell to people who want to do the right thing but don't understand economics very well.  Local producers say, ""You're exploiting third world labor when you buy product XYZ.  Insist on purchasing only goods manufactured by companies that provide first-world income and benefits to their workers.""  It sounds good until you realize the real motivation: removing the competitive advantage that workers in the third world have, namely extremely low cost of labor.

I lived in the developing world for several years and very few Americans or Europeans are fully aware of the purchasing power of the US dollar, the Euro, or the Pound.  In rural China, you can live for a week on a few dollars.  And China is developed by emerging markets standards; there are lots of places where a dollar will last you a month.  A person making a first world salary in a place like this is quite literally the local equivalent of a millionaire.  The local jobs available to the common man -- mostly farming -- pay little or nothing (sustenance farming is still common).  When a company opens, say, a shoe factory in the vicinity that pays a few bucks a day, that's a *very* good job by local standards.

Protectionist policies like fair trade make opening such factories uneconomical, because the low cost of labor is about the only thing that developing economies have to offer.  Typically infrastructure is poor, security is a problem, police are corrupt, everyone wants a bribe -- these costs of doing business add up.  And the local population isn't as well educated, isn't as healthy, and yes, isn't typically as productive as a western worker.  So when you erect artificial barriers, the company says to itself, ""What's the benefit of opening up shop in Senegal or Benin?  I can go to somewhere more developed and get better workers for the same price.""  Result: the local economy continues to stagnate, and the people don't get that first world salary the fair traders thought they were helping them get -- and since the ""sweat shop"" salary we always hear about is still more than what they would be making otherwise, they're even worse off than they would have been had some imperialistic westerner opened up an exploitative factory nearby.

Now, I don't necessarily oppose poor nations doing what they can to keep capital in -- ie, asymmetrical protectionism -- but whenever that happens, people on the right cry foul and claim that they're not playing fair.  I don't think it really matters much -- as long as local people are being paid a salary the local economy will flourish on its own scale.  Wage inflation will take care of itself as time goes on.

I guess that's where we disagree: I don't think protectionism on the part of the developing nations is sufficient or necessary.  The western world needs to tear down trade barriers, and it needs to open its borders to immigration.

Again, these are people who form a ""group"" based on their actions.

I don't like rapists or mass murderers either, but they are not rapists *because* of their persuasions (although belief is often used as an excuse).

If you had a choice between killing a kid who joined the Hitler Youth movement because his society told him to, and trying to educate him out of his ways, which would you choose? 

If, as I hope, you'd try to give the kid a chance to mend his ways, why would you bother? By your argument, he belongs to a hated group, and should be dealt with in the way hated people are dealt with (death penalty, life in prison, etc). However, if you'd try to educate individuals within a hateful group, you must then concede that the ideology is distinct from the individual.

People who join hate-groups as adults -- where ""adult"" is defined as a person sufficiently independent from familial or societal pressures to make such a choice -- are the type of people I think you are targeting. While I agree that this has less to do with intelligence, I would argue that it has more to do with a general level of ""thought"" (which is why I chose to say ""those who think more"" as opposed to ""those who are smarter"").

Insofar as we ""hate"" (if that's the route you wish to take) individuals who commit crimes in the name of a larger group, you'd be hard-pressed to come up with an ideology that cannot be radicalized. Even ""pacifism"" can cause harm, by crimes of omission, etc, if the pacifist in question was inclined to do so. Obviously, I think this is unlikely, and I'm not attacking pacifism; however, I think it is more likely that pacifists choose their ideology over, say, Nazism, based on the type of person they are, not because they stumbled across it and it was cool at the time (as was the case in Germany).

In short, I object to your classification of people by what they've done, rather what they believe. This very stance stratifies them using an entirely different method than the original argument.

*""Recall that Marx also thought that socialist revolutions would first break out in the advanced capitalist countries.""*

This is not at all true. Marx made claim to the idea that the nations such as Germany, England, France and North America would be more likely to go into revolutionary struggle first on the basis of class antagonism being higher than that of more feudal societies. He did not say with absolutism that it would happen that way. Also, Marx was not alive to see the turn of the century. He did not see the growth of Capitalism to Imperialism (though it was not beyond his comprehension). He also did not see the effect Engels' and his works would have on the working class and political climate of Europe. When Marx and Engels brought to the fore their claims of revolutionary struggle, they had not considered the fact that the alternatives to Capitalism had yet to be offered to smaller Feudal nations. We can see clearly, that these alternatives being offered in Russia, meant that it was possible for Russia to move from Feudalism to Socialism. However, this required rapid industrialisation for it to be successful, either that, or for revolutionary upheaval to be successful elsewhere (such as Germany, which was relied upon by the later Communist Party of Russia.)

*""You say that socialism in one country is something that Marx would not have supported.""*

This is neither a question, nor an ambiguous idea. This is a concrete fact. Marx did not support the notion of Socialism/Communism in one country. He makes that perfectly clear in the Communist Manifesto, among other works. Marx was clear that working people of the world had no nation, they were an international class, and for their emancipation to be successful it had to be an act of the entirety of the working class.

What Marx actually said on the topic of internationalism vs nationalism was that the Proletarians of each nation had to first wage war against their own Bourgeoisie. He said specifically that it was the role of Communists to represent the interests of the whole working class, and as such, argue for internationalism, to say that emancipation is not won until the whole of the Bourgeois Class has been overthrown.

If you do not believe my above points, I will gladly quote at length in another response.

In regards to your repeated claim of the 'failure of Trotskyism.' 

Again, I have to say that you are wrong. Clearly, you have not the knowledge base of the far left, or the labour movement of europe during the 60s and 70s, or even as late as the 80s. Clearly, you know very little about the role Trotskyism played overall.

Trotskyism has not died out either, as opposed to the majority of Stalinism, which has by and large fallen to the history books as the unnacceptable idea of totalitarian regimes.

Trotskyism played a huge role in Socialist groups and working class movements through Europe. It was an opposition to Stalinism, primarily. It was also thanks to Trotskyism that later Trotskyites theorised (albeit a little late) that the U.S.S.R was not merely a 'degenerate workers' state' but rather a new ruling class, if you will, a nationalised bourgeoisie. In otherwords, Stalin and his followship harbored support of the middle classes, as had happened in the past, and created a new bourgeoisie. This ruling class however, did not have the same freedoms as other bourgeois across the world. This did change though, as Stalinist forms of Nationalisation and totalitarianism began to be turned on after his death.

It is thanks to Trotskyists that the revolutionary spirit of Marxist theory and Communism continues to exist. Without them, it is very likely that Communism could have fallen to the grave with Stalin and the U.S.S.R or China.

Though, I'll turn to my own perspective on the question of Trotskyism now, one absent of the above.

One of the major tenets of Revolutionary Socialism, or rather, Marxist theory, of Leninist / Trotskyist practise, is not to concern ourselves so much with the horrors of being a minority within a movement. Revolutionary struggle is an objective factor within Capitalist Society. It will, at one point or another, in an uneven swing, push the proletariat toward mass class struggle. Whilst numbers and influence are key to successful Socialist revolution, these struggles will occur with or without us. What kept Trotskyism alive, and why it cannot be considered a failure, is its basis on maintaining an opposition to the falsification and distortion of Communism / Socialism. To keep the revolutionary, Marxist spirit alive, so that if the fight cannot be won today, it can be won tomorrow.

In closing, it is possible to create the foundations for socialist society in individual nations. This however is not the self-emancipation of the whole of the proletariat, and therefore, is not truly Socialism, or Communism.",1234332813,t1_c07lkm4,0,False,socialism,t1_c07iwsh,False,True,,t3_7vcam,c07lkm4,1425922655,0,

I'm not sure how to respond to your post because the idea that the Nazis decided to exterminate Jews (among other ethnicities and political groups) just because Hitler hated them in particular is flat out wrong. The Jews (again - among other groups) were targeted for a variety of reasons all much larger than the simple fact of Hitler's hatred. And in fact, if you study European history, you would find that the Jews were targeted by governments for harassment on a near constant basis. The anti-Jewish Nazi campaign was simply the last in a long line of anti-Jewish campaigns long practiced by European countries. 

The larger issue, I believe, is the way ethnic minorities are treated within nation-states. Is the Holocaust an outlier? Unusual in some way? No, I don't believe so. As recently as 1994 we had a genocide in Rawanda. 

In the end the best response to your post I think I can come up with is that the Jews were most likely targeted for their land, wealth, and possessions.

I am interested in attaching blame to _one_ group: those who seriously believe in stoning, amputating, flogging etc., and want to make these things a reality. They know who they are.

They are like any other psychopath, rapist or murderer, the same rules should apply to them: stop them, prosecute them, bar them from our countries, boycott them if they are in power, call them what they are: murderers, torturers, psychopaths.

There is no reason to bring race or religion into it. What may or may not be interpreted from religious texts is irrelevant. Most religious texts can be interpreted in bad ways, it doesn't matter. I like playing GTA, that doesn't mean I believe in shooting hookers.

When you attach race or religion to this problem you become a right-wing knee-jerk reactionist and you _will_ be treated like one and your cause will go nowhere. People will easily dismiss you and your points because what they will see is some KKK wannabe going on about how its all the Ay'rabs or the Mus'lims fault.

This is exactly why so many European governments are denouncing films like Fitna, because these films just miss the point entirely and turn into an attack on one group of people, a group who is very clearly made up of good and bad people just like any other.

If Wilders for example, really wants to make an impact he should re-make his film to attack barbaric acts _directly_ and not through quotes from the Koran. I can find similar quotes in the Bible and a dozen other texts, and yes, I know ""Christians don't practice this"" yada yada I've heard it all before: the fact that all these Christian countries may not be as barbaric as Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with Islam and everything to do with a complex social and political history.

What the Bible or Koran may or may not say is not the point. Right now, the point is that we need to stop barbaric acts. You can all argue over these books _another_ day, a day when people are not being brutally tortured and flogged.

No, but your philosophy explicitly says not to do anything about it. From a morality standpoint, it's just as bad.

This is laughable, because the Democrats know these theories work in reality. Many of these things were present between WW2 and Reagan. Furthermore, if you travel at all, you would know that many European Countries are successfully using this model. 

It is the Republicans who are petrified. Their model of ""trickle down"" and low taxes was tested over the past 25 years. It has been a demonstrable failure. Things like barstool economics have long dominated the economical and political discourse, and many now are beginning to realize how naive such ""thought experiments"" are. We live in a complex world, and our economic theory is equally as complex.

&gt;I've seen the data, but I am really interested to know exactly how you think they are accomplishing this. Is it really due to actions of the Fed itself or are other factors in play?

Could be a few things, but it's hard to tell due to the lack of transparency. My guess is the Fed is pulling hard out of the commercial paper industry, and is likely selling securities. They're keeping interest low to encourage lending, but they're mopping it up in different areas.

Do evangelical Christians *really* care about the difference between atheists and agnostics (or even non-evangelical Christians) who are strongly against the mixing of church &amp; state (e.g. people who think that freedom *from* religion is a necessary part of freedom *of* religion)?

Evangelical Christians are well aware that the term ""fundamentalist"" has negative connotations and are interested in diffusing the power of that word by applying it to their political enemies.  The same attempt is at the kernel of making straight-line comparisons between Stalin &amp; Pol Pot versus centuries of pogroms against European Jews, the genocidal colonization of the Americas, the Crusades &amp; the Spanish Inquisition (to name a few).  The most obvious difference is that the former group's evil behavior was limited to only one generation.  

One of the main ways in which Christianity was able to maintain its multi-generational evil behavior was through doing away with the separation of church and state.  Again, we see that this is the main goal of today's evangelical Christians.

you're obviously a sunni arab, (which i respect and have nothing against)

and the fact that arabs live in there and are shiites had nothing to do with it, we have a huge population of iranian-arabs living in iran as well, the iranian nationality has nothing to do with race, relegion or colour of the skin

Go read all the official documents about bahrain before it was cut of iran not so long ago

I have a Christian ancestor who fought in the American Revolution, and a grandfather who landed on Normandy at D-Day.  I know what my ancestors did for you, but I don't know anything about your ancestors and what they may have done for me.

I don't blame all of the ""Jewish people"" because of one shithead kid, I just don't accept the big picture concept that the Jewish people are somehow special and truly set apart above any other group among humanity.  They are as flawed as any other humans, and demonstrate this on a regular basis.  This is what I was referring to when I said I lost my faith in the Jewish people after I had stones thrown at me.  

I still have a lot of respect for what my ancestors had to go through in order to preserve their faith, and the suffering they endured under the Romans, the Church, and then in Eastern Europe and later the Nazis.  I just don't buy into the concept that because of the suffering of those who came before, those who are with us now are so terribly holy.  

Every 120 or so years, humanity has a completely fresh slate.  There is no one alive after 120 years who was alive 120 years before: no one who can take credit for what came before... only those who have benefited from/have been hurt by it.  I think that assuming a mantle of the suffering endured by your ancestors is willfully victimizing yourself, and should not be a right of any person.  We must make our own destinies in this world, and hopefully leave better ones for our children.

I don't think that today's Jews are leaving the right kind of legacy for their children.

Universal assent in the modern era, of course :] Christian rationality doesn't count, as ironic as this is.

&gt;I doubt that we even have a way of judging what answers would be most assimilable to objective fact. So even when the idea is simply to approach objectivity, the problem is that we have no way of knowing whether we're getting closer or farther away.

Do you mean in this particular case or in all cases? 

&gt;I wouldn't say better, but given that we aren't capable of an objective morality, I would say that it's more practical to look at ways of incorporating awareness of our subjectivity into our moral judgment, rather than behaving as though we were after all, capable of objective knowledge of moral standards.

I agree, but I think that trying to incorporate subjectivity is just as problematic as trying to incorporate objectivity because subjectivity will lead in different directions (while objectivity leads towards one unreachable destination).

&gt;That's a jargoned way to talk about it. The phrase ""eligious beliefs"" can refer to beliefs about religion and beliefs that make one religious. I was only asking you to clarify which you meant, since it wasn't entirely clear from the context. Based on your inclusion of atheists in the category of people who can have religious beliefs, I take it you meant the former.

I did.

&gt; You won't know whether or not I'm content being a skeptic about them until you've named them and let me answer for myself.

Do you think the earth is round? Universal assent (due to science) should lead to this being *close to* objectively true, but with a simple brain-in-vat thought experiment, this could be proved to be false. If you don't think that consensus leads to a high degree of objectivity, then you're going to condemn yourself to saying ""to the best of my knowledge"" concerning any kind of statement about the natural world.

&gt; If they're self-contradictory they are. And if subjectivity negates sociality, then sociality is self-contradictory since it always refers to the interaction between subjective agents. Since you've asserted that sociality is not nonsense, that must mean that subjectivity doesn't actually negate sociality.

I never said sociality is not nonsense, just that it's not an illusion. Cars are real and cars exist, but the concept of a ""car"" is inconsistent.

&gt; Would we? Evolutionary psychologists like Richard Wright have argued that social behavior is evolved, essentially hardwired. Given that, there's no reason to suppose that we couldn't sustain some brand of sociality without morality. I think it's at least worth entertaining the notion that morality does something more than simply regulate social behavior.

I don't disagree that morality exists particular to preserve our species, but I was just saying hypothetically if one day we all realize that morality was inconsistent, we'd have a hard time reconciling this with how we feel/act. It's hard for me to imagine sociality without morality for beings that make value judgments. And it's even harder for me to imagine people who don't make value judgments.

Do you think that it's possible to have a society without value judgments? Also, before answering that, do you agree that value judgments are an inherent part of morality?

Undoubtedly true.

There's little debate that [slavery was abolished elsewhere in the world for economic reasons.](http://www.google.com/search?q=slavery+abolished+economic+reasons&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a)  Or I should say *institutionalized* slavery.  Indeed, underground slavery exists worldwide.  I have little doubt that the South would not have retained slavery forever.  Social pressures would be another reason.  After all, the many northern states abolished slavery even shortly after U.S. presidents were slaveholders.  

The North was certainly the aggressors in the conflict.  The slavery issue aside (as it should be)  the Confederate States were technically the *good guys* in the Civil War.  It was their revolutionary war.  They happened to lose, but that's just the way it goes.  History has spoken on the matter.  Many historians believe the North and South would have reunified later had the South won.  Others say that had the South won, North America would today look more like the EU.  Who knows?

Then *something happened* and the national, state-owned TV station started broadcasting Star Trek: TNG. I don't want to bore anyone with stories of geekosity and mania, but let's just say there was no fucking way to move me from in front of the TV when TNG was on. It shaped my view on the world and the future and made me dream.

Ok, so I'm not an astronaut (yet!), but I do seek out new life and new civilizations, wherever they are to be found. Star Trek gave me ideals and purpose :). I still watch old episodes of TNG from time to time with great joy.

It's meaningless to complain about people who don't want to work when there are not enough jobs to go around for those who do want.

Britain, as a society, has consistently voted for parties that support providing benefits as a safety net with the full knowledge that benefits will sometimes be abused. Calling it ""theft"" is meaningless when 90+ of the electorate keeps voting for MP's that supports the overall benefits structure. As in most other European countries having the benefits is considered more important than worrying about the people who do abuse it.

You should also keep in mind that there is a difference between unemployment benefits (and in the UK they are a *joke* compared to most of Europe) and social benefits provided to ensure nobody needs to starve or sleep rough, or to protect children. The former *IS* temporary in the UK and most other places. The latter is NOT - we don't consider it acceptable to let people starve even when they don't want to work, and especially not when there are children involved.

Yes!  Give this man a cookie, he's figured it out!

Restrictions on immigration are stupid.  Most people don't want to leave their families, their homes, their language, and their culture behind -- even people from poor countries.  The fear that opening our borders to people from the developing world will cause us to be overrun with poor and dirty brown people is both racist and unfounded.

""Give me your tired, your poor, your hungry"" used to actually mean something in this country, and not surprisingly, it is on the backs of the immigrants that came when an open-door policy was in effect that this country's prosperity was built.

Open the borders!

&gt; no limits, which nicely dovetails into their hatred for social programs, all of which would rapidly disappear were such a policy put in place due to oversubscription....

Right... when did socialists get to be so xenophobic?  What happened to workers of the world uniting?  When did ""let's help the poor"" turn into ""let's close our borders so they can't use our hospitals or schools, let's enact economic protectionism so they can't trade with us""?  Why are you afraid that some undereducated Mexican or West African is going to steal your job?  Are you a fruit-picker or something?  The ones you (presumably) need to worry about are the ones who are better educated and smarter than you, and here's a hint: those folks will probably get visas and steal your job *anyway*.

I'm a leftist, not a libertarian.  Closed borders are just like fences in a bourgeois neighborhood -- designed to keep the rabble out.  And unlike you apparently, I *do* hope that the workers of the world will someday unite.

Most poor people want nothing more than the opportunity to better their position, to work hard, to make it in life.  The ones that have the fortitude to come to a new country and work are the cream of the crop -- they aren't shiftless layabouts, as a rule, that are going to steal your welfare away from you.

In my experience, violent or unsociable behavior on the part of immigrant minority groups usually happens a generation or two in, after they become jaded about their prospects in their parent's adopted country -- because people like you won't open doors for them.  Algerian immigrants in France are a perfect example -- take our side in a colonial conflict, risk your life and limb in the service of la patrie, ensuring you can never live in your home country again, and we'll repay you by never offering you or your children any good jobs or opportunities.  Yay!

(Also, just for your edification, it's much, much easier to get an immigrant visa to Canada than to the US, and I personally knew many Chinese who went to school in the EU because they could get student visas to go to school there -- whereas the US refused them entry even with an acceptance letter to a top-twenty school.)",1234530673,t1_c07na0p,0,True,programming,t1_c07n60x,False,True,,t3_7x1sb,c07na0p,1425923498,0,

The principle in the documentary is pretty straightforward: There would be a cooperation between Europe, the Middle-East and North-Africa to create a stable cycle of solar energy production. Huge solar panel fields would be built in North-Africa and the Middle East, while Europe would be one of the major consumers of its energy production. On regular intervals, there will of course be overproduction. In order to still harness this energy, the people in the documentary suggest that it be used to make hydrogen, thus with energy that would be wasted anyway.

&gt; Not now.

One can argue about timing, but it's worth pointing out that Marx himself consistently argued that a *well* *developed* *capitalism* was a pre-requisite for a socialist revolution in the first place. 

Specifically, he stated that this was necessary because a socialist revolution and the subsequent development of a communist society required a sufficient amount of resources that redistribution would not cause widespread poverty, or (to paraphrase) ""the same shit would happen all over again"".

As a result he argued that the industrialized countries in Europe, and the US, would be best placed for a socialist revolution, and that countries like Russia were nowhere near ready.

The idea that Russia was somehow ""ready"" for socialism was an idea developed by Lenin, that blatantly ignored large parts of Marxist theory, and amongst others depended on a claim by Lenin that the landless farm-workers would support the same changes as the proletariat in the big cities (a claim that proved blatantly wrong)

Of course the idea of ""communism"" with slave labour is ludicrous - a society with the a power structure capable of maintaining slave labour wouldn't be communist in the first place (the core of communism involves the dismantling of the state, for starters).

""Socialism with slave labour"" would also be meaningless. ""Socialism with slave labour"" == feudalism.

I know.  I am actually glad you said that because that is the point that I am trying to make with some other Redditors who insist that some of the European countries are socialist.

&gt;You imply blame for the woes in Europe on socialism while ignoring the detrimental effects of capitalism.

Capitalism does not have any detrimental effects, because it is based on pure voluntary business cooperation, peaceful exchanges, and no initiation of force against person or property.

&gt;Like it or not, a large part of the global recession was caused by capitalism.

No, economic collapses are always caused by a preceding economic boom fed by credit expansion.  The Federal Reserve is ultimately responsible for expanding credit.  F.A. Hayek won a Nobel Prize by showing that when there exists central banks, and they set interest rates lower than what the market would have set them as, then it puts the economy on an unsustainable path.  This is because artificially low interest rates stimulate long term investments that should not be made because the necessary economic resources have not been freed up from the consumption stage and the stages closest to consumption.

Thus the projects that are financed by credit expansion cannot be completed, are liquidated, people are laid off, and recession hits.

If we had capitalism, then the market would set interest rates, and determine the expansion of money.  Under capitalism, the interest rate would only lower if people voluntary saved more, that is, they voluntarily abstained from their consumption more.  This would have freed up resources closest to consumption, and the capital intensive, long term projects that were started because of the low interest rate will be able to be completed.  No liquidations would be necessary and people would not be laid off.  No recession would hit.

This is the economic process that is generated by abandoning capitalism in the field of money and credit.

The investments that cannot be completed are called malinvestments, and in every recession certain parts of the economy are affected more than others.  It just so happened that the latest set of malinvestments in this particular recession were first liquidated in the mortgage industry, where the low interest rates set in course an artificial housing boom.",1234715874,t1_c07ojfd,0,False,Economics,t1_c07o7ro,False,True,,t3_7xdqk,c07ojfd,1425924381,0,

Since then there has been a systematic removal and slicing of the Palestinian Occupied Territories. Using ""security needs"" Israel has slowly taken the high ground in the West Bank for subsidized settlements. Then connected the settlements with ""Jews Only"" roads, thereby taking more Palestinian land.

Slowly Israel has taken more than 50% of the West Bank. This is the new reality. To move from area to area in the ""Palestinian Controlled"" West Bank one must go through up to 600 checkpoints, needing passes only issued by the Israeli military.

Christianity has three main branches: Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant.

[Look](http://www.wadsworth.com/religion_d/special_features/popups/maps/matthews_world/images/w001.jpg) at geography: most of Europe and Latin America is Catholic, northern Europe and the rest of the English-speaking world tends Protestant, and Eastern Europe and much of the Balkans and Russia is Orthodox.

The Catholic-Orthodox split, finalized in 1054, is a West-East split going back to the division of the Roman Empire. It's also a Latin-Greek split: Orthodox Christians still use the Greek texts of early Christianity, whereas Catholicism translated everything into the Latin of the Western Roman Empire. Today the Latin-Greek split can be seen in alphabets: Serbs use the somewhat Greek-looking Cyrillic alphabet because they're Orthodox, and Croats use the familiar-to-us Roman alphabet because they're Catholic.

Catholicism and Orthodoxy have theological differences too. Catholics follow St. Augustine, whose theology is familiar to all Westerners. But Orthodox Christians reject such familiar doctrines as Original Sin and Total Depravity and Atonement, instead holding that God's incarnation as Jesus makes it possible for us to become godlike.

Western Christianity split into Catholicism and Protestantism throughout the 1500s, when the great 'Reformers' Martin Luther, Ulrich Zwingli, and John Calvin rebelled against the Catholic Church. Protestants ended up casting off transubstantiation (the bread and wine in Communion *literally* become Jesus's flesh and blood), prayers for the dead and indulgences and Purgatory, canonization and veneration of of saints (and their relics), etc., as well as a significant section of the Old Testament (the so-called 'Apocrypha'). They claimed to return to a purer Augustinian conception of Christianity, often emphasizing predestination and the utter helplessness of fallen sinful man to achieve salvation without the grace of God. And because they (and earlier proto-Protestant movements) began translating the Bible into everyday spoken languages ('the vernacular'), and thanks to the recent invention of the printing press, there was an enormous emphasis on the authority of *Scripture* as opposed to any human institution like the *papacy*. Luther famously denounced the papacy as ""founded by the devil"" and Calvinists saw the Pope as an anti-Christ and the Church as the ""Whore of Babylon"" from Revelation.

This split had serious political consequences throughout Europe, and the French Wars of Religion and the Thirty Years War ended up with shockingly high percentages of the population slaughtered or starved.

In England, Protestantism came with Henry VIII separating from Rome so that he could get his marriage annulled. He created a sort of English version of Catholicism called Anglicanism (the Church of England), which eventually developed a pretty Calvinist statement of tenets (the Thirty-Nine Articles). The conflict between quasi-Catholic 'High Church' Anglicanism and anti-Catholic puritan Calvinism came to a head with the English Civil War, where leader of the puritan-leaning Parliament Oliver Cromwell had King Charles I beheaded, and then installed himself as ""Lord Protector of England"". After the monarchy was restored, Protestant paranoia about the secret Catholicism of the kings led to a few more assassination attempts and ultimately to the ""Glorious Revolution"", where the safely Protestant Wiliam and Mary of the Netherlands were installed in a *coup d'état*  and the hated Catholic James II run out of the country.

This religious conflict was also political: the party of the Glorious Revolution—the Whig party—saw itself as the party of liberty and the rights of man, as opposed to tyrannical absolute monarchy. The Whigs were Protestants who saw Roman Catholicism as a looming threat to the liberties of free Englishmen. When John Locke famously defended religious toleration, he made two exceptions: atheists and Catholics.

Well, this political ideology made its way to the American colonies. Outside of fleeting Catholic strongholds like Maryland, the Americans were virulently anti-Catholic from the start, and remained so until the 20th century. The heated anti-Catholic rhetoric of the Reformers is still found throughout the South, and can be seen in Protestant nutjobs like Jack Chick. When JFK ran for President, it was a serious question whether America could bring itself to vote for a Catholic.

In any case, figures like Jefferson and Madison were more thoroughgoing than Locke in their defense of religious toleration, extending it to every religious viewpoint—even atheism and Catholicism. And with all the immigrants from Southern and Central Europe, and eventually from Latin America, the US now has a lot more Catholics.",1234746403,t1_c07orvm,0,True,atheism,t1_c07oqus,False,True,,t3_7xldk,c07orvm,1425924636,0,

Amusingly, your site emphasizes the 4 billion year half life of U238 nuclear waste as a scare tactic, ignoring the fact that the U238 is naturally occurring, not generated by nuclear reactors.   Just pointing out that the scientific level of your source is fairly low. 

Here is [another source](http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf40.html) that gives a more complete breakdown of costs, claiming that disposal comes to 5% of total costs.  The main subsidy given to the industry seems to have been loans.

The *entire* nuclear program cost $400 billion 1993 dollars. 

&gt; Half of this was self-financed by Electricité de France, 8% (FF 32 billion) was invested by the state but discounted in 1981, and 42% (FF 168 billion) was financed by commercial loans. 

So if 'discounted' means 'forgiven', then the French subsidy was $32 billion, or 8% of the cost of the program.

Waste disposal will cost $15 billion (not hundreds) and is apparently being paid by producers:

&gt; The cost of the repository is expected to be around EUR 15 billion: 40% construction, 40% operation for 100 years, and 20% ancillary (taxes and insurance). Funds for waste management and decommissioning remain segregated but with the producers rather than in an external fund. ... EdF sets aside EUR 0.14 cents/kWh of nuclear electricity for waste management costs, and said that the 2004 Areva contract was economically justified even in the new competitive environment of EU electricity supply. Total provisions at end of 2004 amounted to EUR 13.4 billion, EUR 9.6 billion for reprocessing (including decommissioning of facilities) and EUR 3.8 billion for disposal of high-level and long-lived wastes.",1234771621,t1_c07oz8r,0,True,science,t1_c07oys0,False,True,,t3_7xmoh,c07oz8r,1425924732,0,

Also, the amendment did not apply to Truman (then President), who would have been free to run for and be elected to any number of terms that the People would have allowed him to serve.  He choose to retire at the end of the term he was then serving though.  

Furthermore, no President before FDR had tried to be elected more than two consecutive times as President because Washington set an unofficial precedent when he retired after serving two terms.

If you would be comfortable with grinding it to fine dust, then pouring that into the ocean, it would be even cheaper.  (Both solutions are, if you look at the numbers, not obviously irresponsible; the latter would add about 0.00001% to the natural concentration of radioactive materials in seawater if perfectly mixed - okay, that's the catch there.) If you insist on building bunkers for it which hold for a million years and can withstand a fusion bomb, the cost will be huge.  

Further, even how much waste is there and what has to be considered waste, is subject to political decisions.  If you, like the US did, ban reprocessing, you have more waste to deal with - which might or might not be more costly than reprocessing, depending on your waste storage policy.  (This also depends on the capability of the reprocessor; while the French appear to have this in smooth control, the Brits horribly botched up their reprocessing.) If you opt for liquid fuel Thorium cycle, even less waste than with reprocessing is to be treated - again, this might or might not alleviate the additional cost for the more complicated liquid salt plant.  

Bottom line, nuclear power is dirt cheap when done the Chinese way, and moderately expensive when done the German or Swedish way (did I mention that all nuclear power producers in US and western europe already pay for the expected storage costs, prior to or at the moment of power production?)

Wind power plants are build and operated profitably at currently double the production costs of the traditional coal/NP/NG mix.  It is not unthinkable this comes down more.  

Buuuuut.. The main problem of wind is that it's intermittent, meaning it blows when it wants to, not when we need it.  As long as wind power is a minor contributor to the power consumption, this can be countered by ramping up and down dispatch power (Gas, or for larger and longer shifts coal or nuclear).  Beyond some market share of wind power, however, you would have a serious problem.  MIT calculated once that every suggested combined solution (i.e., adding some power storage like CAES, pumped hydro, heat, hydrogen) would make the costs of wind explode, so that won't happen.

In F1, both the driver and the team are critical.  One without the other is utterly useless.  To compare it to another sport, F1 is a football team, with the driver being the quarterback.

I don't see that as being a bad thing.

I'm not against spec racing, where the car and team are de-emphasized.  There are lots of such series that are good fun... but NASCARs aerodynamic rules are nonsensical.  They ensure that two bad drivers with bad teams will beat one good driver with a good team every time, so long as the bad drivers are drafting.

Also, the NASCAR points system is a farce.  I doubt there is anybody outside of the sport itself who could accurately name all the points that are possible to receive in a race, without doing math.  ""Oh, he got 43rd place... so that's 34 points""  But then, at the end of the season the top runners all get their points essentially equalized, so that once again, they can pretend that there's close competition, even if one driver has just beat the heck out of everybody else.

The way they run the championship, the last 10 races shouldn't even have 43 cars on the track, because 33 of them are nothing but large and colorful obstacles.  They should admit that there are only 10 cars on track for the last 10 races... but again, that'd spoil the illusion of competition.

Essentially every single aspect of NASCAR is designed to make things seem closer than they are.  From the aero, to the points, to the way cautions are handled.  It's all meant to keep it artificially close, and artificially exciting.

&gt; Besides, if there was ""nothing interesting"" about NASCAR from a driving standpoint, why would Juan Carlo Montoya have come to NASCAR when he left F1 instead of finding a ride on a road-racing circuit in europe.

Because JPM (his middle name is Pablo, not Carlo) wanted to make money, and as a washed up has-been (who wasn't that good in the first place), he realized he could make more money in NASCAR than he could in DTM.

Perhaps you mean the centuries of anti-Semitic sermons by European priests/ministers was like the centuries of Muslim rulings that Jews had to remain dhimmi. I can give you more, but your position requires ignoring everything the Arabs did to the Jews and pretending they were the pure of the pure.

&gt;The Nazis had been relatively unpopular between 1923-1928, but their fortunes changed with the Wall Street Crash in October 1929. Desperate for capital, the United States began to recall loans from Europe. One of the consequences of this was a rapid increase in unemployment. Germany, whose economy relied heavily on investment from the United States, suffered more than any other country in Europe. Before the crash, 1.25 million people were unemployed in Germany. By the end of 1930 the figure had reached nearly 4 million, 15.3 per cent of the population. Hitler, who was considered a fool in 1928 when he predicted economic disaster, was now seen in a different light. People began to say that if he was clever enough to predict the depression maybe he also knew how to solve it.



But Nazis made the recovery much faster, that is hard to deny (with unconventional ways). Nazis (and Japanese) had also part in US recovery, see [Debt in wartime](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/debt-in-wartime/).",1234866412,t1_c07prk3,0,True,pics,t1_c07pg41,False,True,,t3_7xv7x,c07prk3,1425926245,0,

How many palestenians did israel kill since it's inception?

How many did it purge?

That's simply false.

My company has outsourced a bunch of people to a well known consulting company.  The costs, I have this on high authority, have GONE UP.  Reason for outsourcing?  Simple -- the execs don't want to be responsible for failures.  This way, if something fails, the execs in my company get to point a finger to another company.  That's what they are paying extra for.  They are not saving our company any money!  Why do they do this and why do they get away with it?  Simple!  It's an old principle -- agent problem.  Our company is public and basically no one in particular owns it, and so this shit flies, because inside of our company it's basically Soviet style communism culture that's operating.

But more importantly, if by chance the father does get the kids because of a ""drop-off,"" the mother still retains the legal right to sue for custody (in perpetuity) and with the current legal climate, she will most likely get the kids back from the father.

This just happened to one of my wife's students. His mother (a habitual drug abuser) dropped him off at Cook County hospital six years ago (when he was six) and disappeared off the face of the earth, so to speak. The boy lived with his father and his family since that time until four months ago. The mother showed up, went to family services, sued for custody, and got him. 

Despite the fact that the boy was happily living with his father's family, the fact that the father was in a far better financial situation than her and the fact that the mother had drug abuse-related priors; she showed up, did three months in a token court-ordered drug program, and then took the boy from his father.

She remained in state for one month, and then took the boy out of school and left Chicago for Atlanta with no warning, no filed paperwork, and no notice to the father. The father just told my wife that he just got served the child support paperwork two weeks ago (he went to the school to let the administrators/teachers know what happened to the boy).

,0,1,t5_2qh13,1,porkchopprime,"&gt;**Q1.**  DO you deny that Israel announces who their targets are going to be and where they are attacking? This does not meet this definition.

A1.

Israel claimed that the escalation was against Hamas - yet Israeli intelligence itself admits that Hamas did not break the ceasefire.  Numerous news agencies - plus the fatah paramilitaries in question all reported that Hamas, during the ceasefire, arrested said paramilitaries. Then Israel broke the ceasefire on November 4th - but who did Israel attack?  Collective punishment through closure of borders, ports and airspace, denying fuel for electricity, running water.  Israeli soldiers themselves reported that residential areas had been totally destroyed.  Cluster munitions and chemical weapons (white phos.) are recorded - infant mortality is high.


So Israel formed an [Emmanuel Goldstein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Goldstein) and then attacked the **Palestinian people**.

But beyond all that...how does your claiming Israel declares their intentions (however faux they might be) negate the argument of disregard for human rights???  What it does do is support the needed observation of propaganda.  They say they are targeting only Hamas and yet the morgue fills up with children.  The allegation of a school being targeted - the evidence points towards mortars (indiscriminate enough in built up areas) landing outside and yet the IDF releases footage which it knows to be from another time to justify the attack....we're seeing control of the media (plus the restrictions placed on press reporting in Gaza, then and [since](http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-02-03-voa61.cfm)) and propaganda.

&gt;**2.The targets are those who attack Israel**

Hamas didn't break the ceasefire.  The declaration sold was against Hamas:  the Palestinian people are the ones that suffered.  At the end of a 22 day operation homemade rockets were still being fired (which I denounce) and Hamas had found new freshly IDF-radicalised supporters.  It wasn't a war on Hamas...Hamas was the one group that had been trying to maintain the ceasefire (not to say they've not been a nasty group in other ways - they have) and had said [they would accept Israel with 1967 borders](http://www.antiwar.com/orig/rupp.php?articleid=10195).  A claim they repeated [on the eve of Operation Cast Lead](http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-world/hamas-would-recognise-pre1967-israel-20090129-7s62.html)!  As Robert Fisk has put it, ""Yes, I know that **[the Jews of Europe had no Hamas to provide the Nazis with an excuse for their deaths.](http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/fisk/robert-fiskrsquos-world-a-fair-point-everyone-is-equal-in-their-suffering-during-wartime-1609206.html)** But a Palestinian woman and her child are as worthy of life as a Jewish woman and her child on the back of a lorry in Auschwitz.""

Granted you make an interesting point that it is the targets that are demonised and not the tragic victims - not something you can pull off however when it is UN buildings burning, residential areas being flattened (including with bulldozers), resources being restricted and when in Israel itself Arabs themselves are living with marital and property laws concentrated against them.  What we see is a radicalising effect that feeds into the populous.  We have a Liberman that has called for 90% of Arabs to leave Israel.  We see him becoming the 3rd largest party and effectively holding the keys to a coalition.  This, combined with the press enslaught feeds down into the people until things like this become acceptable....[go to 2minutes 50+ on this link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc9DN2Oi0-w&amp;eurl=http://rabbibrant.com/2009/01/09/israelis-protest-attack-on-gaza/)

&gt;**There is a big difference between Hitler (Germany), Mussolini (Italy), Franco (Spain), Suharto (Indonesia), and Pinochet (Chile) and Israel in this scenario. Each one of those previous fascist groups demonized an entire group of people and the governments played propoganda to convince an unwitting population that an entire group of people was at fault and needed to be removed. Not so with Israel.**

Oh I agree Israel is being smarter about it - forming a casus belli around an Emmanuel Goldstein in Hamas (I'll say it again, they launched no rockets during ceasefire and they did not break it) but they, the Israeli Fascists, most certainly do portray a select few as being indicative, and use it to justify actions against the whole.  I still can't get over the 'but they were human shields argument' as license to bomb somebody anyway.  If I were ever taken hostage I wouldn't want the police to think they can shoot me anyway just because a criminal is hiding behind me.



We have collective punishment in Gaza - and then we have propaganda outfits like Memri who do just that - attempt to demonise the whole.  Memri - who pretends to be an impartial Middle Eastern translation service....

The founders of [Memri](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyRdFTorqCw):
•[Colonel Yigal Carmon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yigal_Carmon) in [conversation](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/jan/28/israel2)
•[Meyrav Wurmser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meyrav_Wurmser) and her [think tank biography](http://www.hudson.org/learn/index.cfm?fuseaction=staff_bio&amp;eid=Wurmser)

And they come out peddling this sort of prejudice through cherry-picking, false translation and selective editing:

http://www.memritv.org/

&gt;**Case in point would be the West Bank. They are palestinians who were attacked when attacks were coming from the West Bank. The attacks from the West Bank stop and there is not a strong terrorist presence and Israel does not attack.**

And yet it was Fatah militants controlled by the Administration in the West Bank that launched rockets from Gaza during the ceasefire (Israeli Intelligence confirms, after a government funded NGO was caught confessing it, that Hamas did not fire ANY rockets during the ceasefire) and it was Hamas that [arrested them](http://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL103182282).

Meanwhile what happens in WestBank...[you don't have to wander far!](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7xvf0/in_a_direct_challenge_to_obamas_wishes_israel/)

What you actually have is the Israeli administration doing two things...either broadbrushing an enemy, much as the US/UK falsely used 'War on Terror' or 'Al-Qaeda' to justify their wars, Israel uses Hamas regardless of the facts.  And then when it comes to other Palestinians - they just take their land anyway and throw in some more roadblocks and deny some more visas.  The only difference is when there is a scapegoat, as there is with Gaza, they use tanks and planes but when there isn't such a perceived scapegoat; they use soldiers, bulldozers and bureaucracy.

We can even go on to the next level and look at the inequality in Israel itself...ID cards don't have 'Israeli' for nationality but 'Jew' or 'Arab'.  Are there laws in place that then restrict people purely on the nationality on their Israeli ID card?  You betcha!

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayman_al-Zawahiri

&gt;At Cairo University, Al-Zawahiri studied behavior, psychology and pharmacology graduating in 1974 with gayyid giddan. Following that he served three years as a surgeon in the Egyptian Army after which he established a clinic near his parents.[12] In 1978, he also earned a master's degree in surgery.[13]

So His first specialty was not eye surgery

Now in a related matter, there is the wild field of Military Psychiatry

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Military_psychiatry

Note the history of military experimentation in mind manipulation.

see for example

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgewood_Arsenal_experiments

in which 6,5000 soldiers were tested.

This sort of thing is not confined to the US, but also takes place in China, Russia, Europe, and the Arabic World.

The allegation is that Al-Zawahiri used his knowledge of behavior, psychology and pharmacology to make the best terrorist for Al-Qaida. 

And that a psychiatrist is not concerned with morals, but merely the ends and desires of his pay masters. In this case Al Qaida.

This leads to 9/11

Again, psychiatry has paymasters, and is too often used for profit, not for the benefit of mankind.

,0,-1,t5_2qh13,-1,[deleted],"Its not a subtle point they're making there but it seems to me that the Israeli government has made every effort to help bring this sentiment into the Muslim world limelight.

You never hear about Indonesian extremists threatening to eradicate Malaysia or Singapore. You never hear about Turkish extremists threatening to exterminate Greece or Cyprus - even though the countries have a territorial dispute they somehow manage to reach lasting peace treaties through negotiations and diplomacy. 

Only Israel finds itself in a unique position of invoking such resentment. 

Granted, Islamic ""scholars"" add fuel to the fire when ever they see an opportunity but even radical Israeli nationalists cannot deny that the state of Israel does well enough on its own to continually keep the fire going. PLO tried for decades to force a compromised agreement out of Israel to no avail. What did they expect? That after over 30 years of fucking the Palestinian general population in the ass with a crowbar some crack-pot psychopath wasn't going to come along and harness the frustration of the populous? 

My other concern is the involvement of the United States with Israel. 

What happens if the Iranians and Russians start figuring out that ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" and postpone their disagreements in order to better deal with the mutual immediate threat? What happens if China goes fishing for a new trade partner and finds one, one that will pay their bills; China doesn't give a fuck about the States, Europe diplomatically bows out off all ongoing alliances in order to weather the economic storm and Russia embraces Iran and India?

What are the States going to bring to the table to help themselves face tough pressure in the Security Council from China and Russia and no help from France or Britain? 

It is absolutely clear to everyone that the current stake US has in Israel and the *status quo* as it stands is unsustainable even in the current intentional political climate. That the US will dump Israel is no longer a question of ""if"" but rather ""when"" and to what extent. And when Israel can no longer bask under the shade of the US's sheltering wing, what kind of effect will that have on it?

Kissinger is absolutely right when he says that ""we have no friends, America only has interests"" and all that the US foreign policy, in general, and its policy towards Israel, in specific, is achieving in the short and medium term, is going to be come undone and reveal itself for what it is, in the long term - handing Israelis enough rope to hang themselves. When that point is reached (inevitably - as the only thing that can prevent that from happening is WW III) Israel will find itself without adequate resources and self-reliance to sustain or defend itself amidst and from angry neighbours. The backlash of everything that has happened up until this point will be fierce and violent. It will probably mean the end of the state of Israel in a murderous rage. 

But all that is preventable if only the compromises would be made now. US can relieve so much pressure from itself and strengthen alliances and partnerships with Russia and Europe - hell, even Iran - if only they would bring Israel in line. Israel can enjoy a much needed period of peace and prosperity if only they'd take a softer stance and create political dialogue with the Palestinians. 

In addition and most importantly: Palestinian prosperity is absolutely indispensable in the equation and the US and Israel need to lend a helping economic hand - if not out of a feeling of moral obligation then because it is in their best interest. That would simultaneously spell the end of radical Islamic government in Palestine and it would help bring other Muslim nations on board to the idea of peaceful co-existence with Israel. The initial round of capital would have to be fed via an acceptable ally proxy (such as Saudi Arabia) until the extremist sentiment simmers down in both Israel and Palestine.

But no. The American foreign policy is and has been so mercenary for the last 50 years that the US apparatus has forgotten to deal with the rest of the world in any other way apart from ""ride the horse until it collapses, then shoot the horse and eat it"". US doesn't know any more how to diffuse bombs without detonating them. The only countries immune to its devastating reach are the ones that sit on the Security Council i.e. have amassed large armament supplies and have vast and prosperous military-industrial complexes. So how can any sane government in such a world not be striving to arm itself with nuclear missiles in just anticipation, never mind the nut-bars currently in charge in the Middle East who wouldn't need a motive in the best of times? 

And with likes of ""Global Anti-Aggression Campaign"" and the ideas that they promote only gaining strength and following the question that presents itself is the question any reasonable person would ask themselves when faced with a prospect of an escalating argument with an armed lunatic: do I really want to play chicken with a person who ""speaks to God""?

The former is evidence of a common Pal/Jewish ancestry *not* linked to the broader common relationship of Arabs/Jews.  The latter is indicative of Arab migrations.  

The following quote separates Pal genetics into acommon Pal/Jewish ancestry, and a component from Arab migration:

&gt; We propose that the Y chromosomes in Palestinian Arabs and Bedouin represent, to a large extent, early lineages derived from the Neolithic inhabitants of the area and additional lineages from more-recent population movements. The early lineages are part of the common chromosome pool shared with Jews (Nebel et al. 2000). According to our working model, the more-recent migrations were mostly from the Arabian Peninsula, as is seen in the Arab-specific Eu 10 chromosomes that include the modal haplotypes observed in Palestinians and Bedouin. These haplotypes and their one-step microsatellite neighbors constitute a substantial portion of the total Palestinian (29%) and Bedouin (37.5%) Y chromosome pools and were not found in any of the non-Arab populations in the present study. The peripheral position of the modal haplotypes, with few links in the network (fig. 5), suggests that the Arab-specific chromosomes are a result of recent gene flow. Historical records describe tribal migrations from Arabia to the southern Levant in the Byzantine period, migrations that reached their climax with the Muslim conquest 633–640 a.d.; Patrich 1995). Indeed, Arab-specific haplotypes have been observed at significant frequencies in Muslim Arabs from Sena (56%) and the Hadramaut (16%) in the Yemen (Thomas et al. 2000). Thus, although Y chromosome data of Arabian populations are limited, it seems very likely that populations from the Arabian Peninsula were the source of these chromosomes. The genetic closeness, in classical protein markers, of Bedouin to Yemenis and Saudis (Cavalli-Sforza et al. 1994) supports an Arabian origin of the Bedouin. The alternative explanation for the distribution of the Arab-specific haplotypes (i.e., random genetic drift) is unlikely. It is difficult to imagine that the different populations in the Yemen and the southern Levant, in which Arab-specific chromosomes have been detected at moderate-to-high frequencies, would have drifted in the same direction.

Again, this agrees with historical accounts that the Palestinians *are* the Jews, with an admixture of Arab blood.  Similarly, genetic studies suggest that Jews are patrilineally  Levantine (from Y chromosome), but with the female (mitochondrial) side being heavily European.

There's certainly more mutation due to having a giant population so the gene pool has a bigger reserve of things to play with were some serious selection to be applied.

A broad outline

Israel is the regional power. It is the big mean dog, it has all that it wants, the land, military dominance over all its neighbours, trade, the coverage of the worlds only super power. Israel wants peace as it is comfortable. Israel wants to maintain the current status quo as is. Israel wants to impose a peace on a defeated people. Those who rule always want peace. 

I dont expect anyone to agree with the Palestinian POV but at least to understand it.

Palestinians do not place the same premium on peace the Israelis do. They have very little. They have issues that need addressing, the right of return, the occupation of the West Bank, the annexation of Jerusalem, the economic shut down, the total control and blockade of their areas. They see peace as surrender. This is why they keep firing rockets. They want justice The ruled always do.

To get Peace the Israelis have to address issues they do not want to. Until Israel is prepared to do that, there will not be peace.

It can be done, The UK showed the way when it talked to the IRA with no pre-condtions. No, ""edit the United Ireland part of your charter"" before we talk. The commander of the Londonderry IRA is now a UK member of parliament and Northern Ireland is still a part of the UK. By talking to the extremists, you fractionalise them, those that want peace, and those that want to fight. To strengthen the hand of those that want peace serious concessions have to be made, when those that want to derail the peace talks strike with rocket attacks and car bombs you have to be very careful with retaliation. Its a long slow road, but there was a time when Northern Ireland looked as hopeless as Palestine, but look at it now. 

The PLO was willing to change its charter and recognize Israel, didn't get them anywhere...

The solution to the problems obvious. All the peace plans are essentially the same. Clinton's Peace Plan, the Nusseiba-Ayalon Plan, the Saudi Peace Initiative, Bush’s Road Map, Oslo, Taba summit are all pretty similar

They all include clear measures that Israel has to take in order to make peace:

1.Dismantle the settlements, 2.Withdraw its soldiers and civilians from the occupied territories, 3.Create a viable Palestinian state, 4.find a solution for the Palestinian refugees' right of return. 5.Find a way to guarantee Israeli security. Altho' I believe having nuke addresses that. 6.A creative way to reward Israel for giving up what it feels it has won in war. $3B pa?

The problem is Israel refuses to go along with these plans. At some point, there will be an ""event"" and the talks will fail. developing new plans is a waste of time. Israel wants to keep the West Bank Israel has not dismantled a single settlement built there, and has never ceased to take Palestinian lands under the guise of security.



To end here a great quote from 1938. George Antonius

""The treatment meted out to Jews in Germany and other European countries is a disgrace to its authors and to modern civilisation that posterity will not exonerate in any country that fails to bear its proper share of the sacrifices needed to alleviate Jewish suffering and distress. To place the brunt of the burden upon Arab Palestineis a miserable evasion of the duty that lies upon the whole of the civilised world. It is also morally outrageous. No code of morals could justify the persecution of one people in an attempt to relieve the persecution of another. The cure for the eviction of Jews from Germany is not to be sought in the eviction of the Arabs from their homeland and the relief of Jewish distress must not be accomplished at the cost of inflicting a corresponding distress upon an innocent and peaceful population"".",1235029362,t1_c07rc4x,0,False,worldnews,t3_7yahz,False,True,,t3_7yahz,c07rc4x,1425927043,0,

In spite of the current economic condition of the United States, the dollar is rising against other currencies.

There are many reasons for this, but one very significant reason is that the United States is a capitalist country.

Capitalism creates jobs. It also destroys them. It offers no guarantees... it punishes and rewards according to effort and ability. 

Social democracy, which is socialism lite, like all social programs is a ponzi scheme, which relies upon demographic assumptions that are simply not true.

Nations that are cited as shining beacons of social democracy - like Norway - are only able to maintain the facade due to favorable demographics AND oil exports.

There is simply no way around the fact that there is no free lunch. No matter how much you wish it were so.

If you steal/take money from someone to give to someone else you have committed a crime. And most importantly you have severely impacted the rewards of hard work and effort... overtime this leads to a dependent society and ultimately bankrupts the system...

For those mathematically inclined, this is all very easily modeled... every time you set up a socialist scheme, you start a timer on failure.

It is not a case of defcit = bad, surplus = good. Governments should run deficits during economic downturns and then run surpluses during periods of economic growth to balance it out.

,0,9,t5_mouw,9,RationalUser,"My thoughts on this issue and its problems:

1.  Our cultural definitions of race are usually not meaningful, a person with dark skin, for instance, doesn't necessarily descend from African ancestors.  Our President, for instance, is widely considered to be black, even though only half his genes are from an obvious recent African source.  Of course, this is just a modern example of a long-standing reality, which is...

2.  ...almost none of the 'races' that we recognize (Asian, African, European, Middle-Eastern) were ever genetically separated from each other for any significant amount of time.  Which is why whenever studies on numerous genetic markers are done, most of those markers occur with identical frequency no matter where your ancestors are from.  If you study population genetics of all kinds of animals, you learn very fast that gene flow isn't the same as individuals moving, and it doesn't take much gene flow to keep a population 'interbreeding'. Which isn't the same as saying that...

3.  ...there are significant differences in certain genes between what we consider races.  Those differences are evidence of selective pressure.  The best example is sickle cell anemia in Africans, which had no benefit for early Europeans, but which allowed Africans to avoid malaria.  These are the markers that people use to 'identify' the area your ancestors are from, or what medical conditions you might be susceptible to.  Which leads me to...

4.  The kinds of questions we ought to be asking are about the selective pressures in particular climates or regions that lead to unique gene frequencies in the people who live there.  How do the conditions in a place affect the fitness of different human genotypes?  Are the current inhabitants still evolving to adapt to those conditions?  Are these adaptations epigenetic or nucleic?  Can these advantages be replicated in others?  Can we mitigate disadvantages that might occur?  

The focus on 'intelligence' is not really meaningless, but at this point in our history, I'm not confident we have the tools to even define it in a meaningful way, let alone measure it.  And I'm damned certain we lack the capacity to deal with the results rationally.  That doesn't mean I think we should hold back or censure those who are doing legitimate research on the subject.  I just think that if I had to prioritize, intelligence wouldn't be the first thing I'd look at with respect to ancestry or 'race'.

And as a side note, the authors of the article make a strong case for not censuring those doing research on the connection between race and intelligence, but they do a piss-poor job of picking prominent examples of those who were 'censured' unjustly.  Jim Watson and Lawrence Summers were _not_ researchers publishing novel results, they were authorities using disputed science in order to make policy suggestions.  A large majority of people (and scientists) did not feel it was appropriate to interpret the data in such a manner, and no longer trusted them to avoid using similarly flawed interpretations in other decision-making.  That's really no different than people making a public issue out a politician's private life.

Again, this has nothing to do with your argument.  Go to any store in the US and they're cheaper too.

In general, the only times Steam ever has prices that are actually lower, is all the sales they do.

The difference is that the developer has direct control over the prices on Steam.  Retailers buy in bulk and are a bit quicker to lower prices as there is much more competition.

Edit: A US example (online store even):  My favorite online retailer has [Fallout 3 for $35](http://www.gogamer.com/Fallout-3-for-PC-Front-Page_stcVVproductId46651269VVcatId444710VVviewprod.htm).

And a person's ancestors' history of adaptation is read in their genes.

Although I'd like to point out that much more than adaptation can be read in our genes.  When we use haplotype profiling to determine somebody's ancestral history, the vast majority of the genetic similarities we see are due to random fluctuations (""genetic drift"") rather than adaptation.

Think of it this way -- a group of proto-humans starts with genotype AAAAA.  This is a tiny part of their DNA, not part of any gene, part of the ""junk"" DNA.  From these proto-humans, one group wanders out of Africa and goes to Europe.  A random mutation (and not adaptation) changes the DNA to AAAGA.  Another group wanders out of Africa and goes to Japan.  A random mutation changes *their* dna to ATAAA.

Now, in the present day, when they all get on a plane and move to Chicago and have kids, those kids will have either AAAGA or ATAAA at this genetic locus, just as a result of the history of random mutations of their ancestors.

Also in the present day, we see that 80% of people of Japanese ancestry have ATAAA at this locus, and 75% of those with European ancestry have AAAGA at this locus.  We can say with some statistical sureness that a person with ATAAA at this locus has some European ancestry.

,0,1,t5_2qh9z,1,generic_handle,"&gt;I'm not sure I want to generate wealth...

Well, probably not in the sense of stacks of diamonds floating around, but I suspect that you do want wealth, albeit perhaps in the form of services or standard-of-living, and perhaps distributed more evenly.

My point is, though, that you said that public health insurance reduces costs.  I can see an egalitarian argument, but I don't see an argument of cost-effectiveness -- that was what I was taking issue with.

&gt;You incur the greatest health care costs at the very end of your life. So if you pay in more than you need throughout your life, when you need that money at the end, it's there for you.

I wouldn't have nearly as large a problem with the state setting up a pool that someone has to pay at least a certain amount into, that is subsequently there when they're old.  I probably wouldn't advocate it as a policy, but I think that it's very difficult to argue that anyone should *not* save at all.  And I think that the *real* context is that people have an issue with financial equality, and that what they want to do is make sure that people who are less-well-off have access to health services, and a pool should make them happy.

There's a good reason that no policy (Social Security, etc) works like this -- if you're a politician and you start a new service, you want it to have effect *immediately*, so that you can reap the political benefits.  Waiting a lifetime for it to come into full swing, as the pool slowly builds, is decidedly unrewarding.  It's much easier to base it on debt assigned to the next generation.

This is really great for the current generation.  They get full-blown, free services.  Very politically popular with a group that gets guaranteed free services.  The problem is that this *also* generates a large amount of risk for the next generation -- if something goes wrong, they lose out.  And the next.  Chances are pretty good that at *some* point, you're going to have some sort of significant problems, and then you have a whole generation without assets for their retirement.

Now, the loser of such a program (unless one feels that populations will keep expanding and governments won't run into financial problems) is a generation at some undefined point in the future, and the recipient is here, now, and voting.  I recognize that there are political incentives to do so.  My point is that it's trading a significant amount of risk for those immediate benefits, and I think that many people don't realize that.  Our obligations to return money to people who have paid into the ""future services"" pool today are enormous -- we owe them many times over the official national debt.  Just as when someone takes out a loan on a house, to put it topically...if they're left unable to pay that debt at any point in the future, someone's going to get badly burned.  And we don't ever propose to equal out that obligation, to build up a pool of covering a generation's future services, so we always have that debt sitting there.

&gt;If you calibrate the rates correctly, you wouldn't even run into some of the problems social security is projected to run into in 40 years...

IIRC, Medicare was projected to be more of an issue than Social Security.  Either people will go without benefits, or we will need to drastically increase taxation.

A secondary problem is that there's a spat between fiscal conservatives and fiscal liberals.  If you're a fiscal conservative politician, you're probably most-heavily supported by people who are concerned about taxes.  If you're a fiscal liberal politican, you're probably most-heavily supported by people who are concerned about services.  There are serious political costs to raising taxes or reducing services, so there's a strong political incentive to do one without the other, and hope that the *other* group has to do the raising of taxes or the reducing of services.

That works all right (well, it's not great, but at least it's not catastrophic) in the event of something like the California budget.  It might seriously hurt California, but in the end, there are valid resolutions.

But in the case of nationwide health care, it's an entire generation of health care at stake.  If the shit hits the fan, the elderly (who had less assets available to save and in any case assume that the service will be there when they come around) are simply going to not have any health care.

Now, I can propose that advocates of national health insurance run out and do the funding thing I described above, where they build up over time.  That's egalitarian (which is, I suspect, what nearly all are really concerned about).  However, I'm under no illusion as to its political viability.  No politician is going to mandate that a generation start socking away money for benefits that only reach full levels a generation from now.  It's much easier to take out the debt.  It won't show up on a balance sheet, and there are no *written* obligations -- you'll just have the state able to adjust benefits.  

The difference between what I'm talking about and what you're talking about is that I'm talking about actually *storing* those assets somewhere -- saving, having each generation pay for itself.  Social Security (and the national health insurance system that is being proposed) doesn't do that -- it has each generation pay for the last generation.

The net effect of such a scheme is a more egalitarian distribution of goods, a short-term rapid increase in health spending (since the future savings of the next generation are being rapidly transferred to the elderly) and the saddling of future generations with a financial bomb that explodes if the work force ever starts dwindling or there's a financial disaster of some sort.  That's what I'm concerned about.  No politician is going to be tremendously interested, because it doesn't *apply* to them.  It's an issue for someone well-down the road.  Maybe a hundred years down the road.

Maybe China will become a major industrial power, and people in the US will go on work visas to China, just as people in Middle Eastern states often do to European countries today.

McCoy outlines how the CIA has a history of forming brief alliances with disreputable groups in hopes of achieving some short-term political gain, e.g. thwarting communism.  So, for example, in Burma and Afghanistan the CIA provided arms, logistics, funding, and legal protection to a number of pretty bad people whose only redeeming quality was that they would kill some commies.  For these groups to succeed, large sums of cash are needed and so they naturally turned to drugs to raise the capital.

The problem of course is that once the CIA mission ends, you are left with these powerful drug kingpins who have grown accustomed to the insane profits provided by drugs. The numbers are interesting: as the CIA backs drug kingpins, the number of addicts in the US and Europe goes up.

&gt;When the 1913 Federal Reserve act was passed it promised to regulate the monetary systems of the United States to prevent drastic boom and bust cycles. The result has been that the United States has since gone through nine recessions.

Admittedly, you seem to be the only one here addressing what Martin was actually talking about, which is international financial regulation. I'm more interested in the social and political effects of unification.

It seems to me, though, that your example of the nine recessions after the Federal Reserve Act is anecdotal. What does the objective research say about the effects of regulation, and different types of regulation, versus non-regulation? What was the economy like before regulation, and was it similar enough to today to even make those kinds of comparisons? I doubt very much all regulation is equal. Consider Canada's much stabler economy, which is generally credited to our stronger regulation.

&gt;It is interesting that you mention this because the European Union is a prime example of this global unification effort gone wrong. During the last constitutional referendum only Ireland gave its citizens the opportunity to vote in favor or against the EU constitution and they voted against it!

True, but to say that makes it an example of the unification effort gone wrong is reaching. Something like eight out of ten of the countries who put the 2005 treaty to referendum approved it. And it's not as if it was a referendum on the existence of the EU in general -- it was a push for greater integration among the states than they currently have. If the people aren't ready for that next step, I wouldn't push it on them. Support for the EU itself has pretty much always been over the 50% mark in the member states, and sometimes much higher.

**Edit**: Oh, one other thing. They're not proceeding against Ireland's objections, they're [making concessions to Irish voters and putting it to a second referendum this year](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6901353.stm).

The Zulu and Akan people of Africa are both black, they belong to the same racial category.

The Norwegian and French people of Europe are both white, they both belong to the same racial category.

But, we find that the Zulu and Akan are more different, genetically speaking, from each other than they are from the Norwegians or French.

That's why people say that from any standpoint but a social standpoint race is not a valid concept.  It doesn't actually measure anything, it's categories are divided along lines that really aren't genetically significant (the gene complexes that control facial features, skin tone, etc are relatively simple, change at the drop of a hat (evolutionarily speaking) and not related to much of anything else as far as geneticists can tell).

Its the same thing we're encountering in most biological sciences, especially WRT taxonomy.  The old taxonomies, based purely on physical appearance, are turning out to be invalid quite often.  Our ancestors drew the lines in the wrong places. Not that its their fault, they couldn't analyze genes the way we can so physical appearance is all they had to go on.

But it does mean that dividing humanity by skin tone (and, really, that's what ""race"" boils down to) doesn't work.  There are genetically valid groups into which to divide the human species.  But race, skin tone, isn't part of that.

When the Zulu have more in common (genetically speaking) with the French than they do with the Akan it means that division by skin tone doesn't provide any worthwhile classification.

It'd be quite convenient if obvious features like skin tone, hair texture, etc really did provide clues as to the significant genetic groupings of humanity, but they don't.

It'd like trying to argue that mice and elephants belong in category A because they both have gray surfaces, and alligators and parrots belong in category B because they both have green surfaces.

&gt;&gt;The elite class in Israel are not immediately affected by this tactic

&gt;So?

... Isn't the goal of having a boycott to create change by influencing those at the top? I think you're trollng me, Malcontent, and not doing a very good job. :)

&gt;&gt;If anything, it'll make them strong in the way that they can say that the world is ""turning against them"" and that the entire world is anti-semitic.

&gt;They say that now. They said that last year. They have been saying that for the last fifty years.

And it worked then. And it worked last year. And it has been working for the last fifty years.

&gt;Or might convince them to achieve peace.

See the statements I have made. By stabbing a man in the eye he doesn't look to hug you but stab you back. Violence begets violence, and rage fuels more rage. It's saddening you cannot see this.

&gt;Do you have proof of this?

&gt;If this is true I think it's the most vile and disgusting israel has ever done. We should punish israel simply for doing such a thing.

As it currently stands all Palestinians products, commodities, and materials have to go through several junctures in order to exit Palestine. This lands Palestinian goods in Israel and, following this, it is then sold to, in most cases, to Israeli traders. These traders then send then send these goods abroad as Israeli goods.

Read the above three articles. You'll see that a). Palestinians cannot export from Palestine, b). those who do work in the export industry work in Israel, and, therefore, c). causing harm to the Israeli factories/economy will harm the some 40% of the Palestinian population that work in Israel. So, by boycotting Israeli goods, we're harming Palestinians. As a consquence of exports of Palestinian toil in Israeli enterprises, all products made by the hands of Palestinians are stamped with the proverbial seal of Israel.

&gt;Probably not as much as killing their children and destroying their houses.

It's a very outdated view that US is free and EU isn't: first the US became more and more statist almost every decade except the eighties, and the EU realized it's too statist in the nineties, and reforms were made almost everywhere to make it freeer, the famous Swedish welfare state was heavily reformed, brought closer to a market structure, the Dutch healthcare system is almost completely privatized now except for some subsidies etc. Germany is thinking about putting more market-oriented incentives into the healthcare system because it's now ""a jointly financed but privately exploited supermarket"" etc. etc.

It seems in 10 years US and EU will meet somewhere in the middle. 

It's a bit like this: say 30 years ago US was 20% socialist, EU was 60% socialist, now it seems both place will finally reach a similar compromise at say 35-40%.

Five years. In 1951 the first iteration of the EU was formed in the form of the European Coal and Steel Community.

&gt;Sanctions didn't mean no trade.

The sanctions on Iraq blocked everything but medical supplies, foodstuffs, and humanitarian aid. 500,000 dead children, a total 1,000,000 dead Iraqis, and others can show how this was a trade sanction that almost wholly severed trade with Iraq.

&gt; Many countries in europe had trade with iraq.

Yeah? France does. And so does Russia. Who wasn't attacking Iraq during the invasion? France and Russia.

&gt;That's not true. There is trade between israel and lebanon.

There's trade. But is there enough of it, and to the level of the EEC, that'd make war unfavourable for both sides? No.

Israel has policies which disfavour Lebanon. That's not free trade, Malcontent. If you return to my initial statement I didn't just mean trade. I wrote *free trade* and unrestricted access to ideas/goods.

&gt;Also using proxies doesn't mean you are not waging a war. It just means you are using another country as a weapon.

It's good knowing that you agree with me about the war piece. And the weapon half? That wouldn't happen if Lebanese-Israeli relations allowed for free trade.

&gt;The weaponry used by hamas and israel are equal in terms of damage.

&gt;That's your argument right?

Yes.

Both rely on fear and on killing civilians. The only difference is how much time it takes. For Hamas, IED and rockets kill Israelis over years. Israel can level Gaza in a week and kill 500 people rather quickly.

&gt;Actually it's not. You really should read up logical fallacies before you make yourself look even more stupid.

This is your logic, Malcontent:

&gt;&gt;&gt;Action A isn't being done. Because A isn't done, and we haven't seen any changes in the situation, then A should be done.

Say a diabetic walks into your clinic, Dr. Malcontent. He isn't taking heart medication. Seeing this, you force him to take heart medication because, of course, not doing so hasn't done anything for him.

You're prescribing medicine for the wrong condition and it's bad form. It's also called a logical fallacy.

&gt;Israel denies palestenians work. It works very hard to make sure they don't have an economy at all.

&gt;So boycotting israel isn't going to effect them that much more.

When reading a sentence it's normally wise to read the whole post to get a hold of the entire thought being shown. If you took the time to read my post you'd see that I made the point that, if Israeli products became boycotted, Palestinians employed in Israeli companies would be harmed.

And lose their jobs.

And the anger over losing their jobs, losing their small piece of prosperity, would help Hamas with a moral/philosophical victory. Which, as I stated in short order, would push the violence onwards.

It seems you missed this. I suppose it doesn't matter, since you've made up your mind. Hopefully people reading this post wont be so quick to jump to an idea just because it follows *Argumentum ad populum*.

As someone who lives and works outside of his own country for about 10 years now, the issue of taxation has cropped up many times between me and my friends. Those friends who are American have told me about the taxation issue, and it surprised me at first. As a UK citizen, I never got the impression that I had any responsibility to pay tax back to the UK while I was living and working in Luxembourg, China etc. So when US citizens talked about it, I had to wonder about the practicality of it.

Is it really (a) reasonable and (b) remotely practical for Americans to pay taxes to the US government when they're neither living nor earning in the US? (And I understand it's different if you have assets there such as a house).
Isn't it infinitely more reasonable to tax income *only in the locality where it's generated*?

Consider the EU. It has monetary policy determined by the ECB (a Central Bank for all of Europe), but it has fiscal policy determined by individual nations. That sounds stupid to me.

In a similar vein, on a global scale: We have financial laws and regulations to govern the allocation of capital set within nation states, and yet capital is allowed to flow quite freely between states.

Globalisation has been about this all along, for example arbitraging labour laws - investing where labour law is weak and therefore maximising profit.

Bottom line: it is obviously impossible to tax and regulate money locally if you allow it to be allocated globally.
Why not just accept that tax on income should be applied at the source of that income? Once that tax has been applied, the money could then be free to roam the globe as it sees fit.

The only other alternative I see is the ""global government"" option which so many are terrified of (and is obviously not going to happen in our lifetime barring WW III).",1235274534,t1_c07tc8b,0,False,worldnews,t3_7z664,False,True,,t3_7z664,c07tc8b,1425928211,0,

&gt; The average capital reserves for Canada's Big Six banks — defined as Tier 1 capital (common shares, retained earnings and non-cumulative preferred shares) to risk-adjusted assets — is 9.8%, several percentage points above the 7% required by Canada's federal bank regulator. That's a little better than major U.S. commercial banks like Bank of America, but significantly higher than an average capital ratio of about 4% for U.S. investment banks and 3.3% for European commercial banks.

&gt; Another factor that helped make Canada the new gold standard in banking was Ottawa's decision in the late 1980s to allow commercials banks to acquire investment dealers on Toronto's Bay Street, the country's financial hub. As a result, these institutions are subject to the same strict rules as commercial banks, while U.S. investment dealers are subject to only light supervision from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, of course, will now be under the U.S. Federal Reserve's supervision since they have been chartered as bank-holding companies.

[Link](http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1855317,00.html).

So Canada requires _all_ of its banks to play on the safe side with the reserve ratio, whereas in the United States, well...

Yes, yes, yes, there's the sub-prime mortgages too, but it all comes down to what I think is this simple fact: make-believe money is dangerous, simply because of the complexity of the securities we create to dispense it.

It's like code; complexity kills.  In this case, we have a situation where the securities are structured in such a convoluted fashion that maybe only 5% of the population really understands what is going on.

That 5% inevitably then finds ways of exploiting the remaining 95% of the population through fine print and other shenanigans, and so the incentive exists to create bigger and bigger quantities of this make-believe money because in doing so, their piece of the action grows with it.

This leveraging is what eventually kills the economy.  Canada is fine now, but that's only because it's cycle isn't due yet.

And as we saw with CNBC's David Faber's interview of the CEO of Bear Stearns, any kind of fractional reserve system is vulnerable to allegedly trusted sources dispensing bad information.  Yes, it was discovered after the fact that Bear Stearns was over-leveraged, but that really didn't have any bearing on shutting down the bank.

I see no reason why we need fractional reserves.  It seems the only interests that serves are the banks.  Fuck the banks, the point of the economy isn't to serve the needs of greedy bankers, it's to serve the needs of society.

But you're right - the EU is an erosion of democracy.  Trade is one thing, bureaucracy and a constitution is another.  Those who think it is preposterous that the EU corrodes democratic representation - look at the numbers (do it for your own country).

•Number of UK MPs : 646

•Population of the UK: 61 million or 94,000/MP

•Number of MEPs = 785 (due to drop down to 736)

•Population of the EU = 500 million or 640,000/MEP

•Number of UK MEPS = 78 or 780,000/MEP

I can either share my representative who decides laws with 94,000 other people and be anti EU or I can be pro-EU and share my elected representative with 780,000.  Which is more representative of the individual?  Clearly it isn't the EU. ",1235319377,t1_c07tk6t,0,True,worldnews,t1_c07tjmg,False,True,,t3_7zd0r,c07tk6t,1425928317,0,

One interesting point from that book is that genetic determinism is a monocausal explanation for behavior, and is therefor an extreme simplification in a world of multiple causes, feedback and feedforward effects, etc. You cannot separate the genome that causes you to act the way you do from the environment that both impacts the expression of those  genes, and is also impacted by the expression of those genes. Of course one must approach science in a reductionist way to have any hope of making progress, but you shouldn't then assume that your reductionist models *are* reality. They are only valid in certain ways.

EDIT: Additionally, I believe the OP finds genetic determinism ""very disturbing"" because it shares a great deal in common with the notion of blood lineages from medieval Europe.

Personally, I think that healthcare in the US is rather better than Cuba's in most regards, but that sort of misses the point.  My objection is to the fact that after watching Moore's movie, if one has no other knowledge of the characteristics of the health systems, one comes away with the impression that Cuba's system is fantastic and the US one is a disaster.

A serious look at healthcare systems in the context of discussing national healthcare in the US would include the VA (our *existing* national healthcare system, which currently serves the military), bring in more numbers and less anecdotes, and discuss issues like wait time, what's covered, and differences like litigation awards and labor costs in the US.

Moore's making a political argument.  I'm not saying that there's no useful information in the thing (though it's really more oriented at making an emotional argument than slapping statistics on the table), but at the very least, you want to watch something that covers the down sides of nationalized health care systems and the up sides of the US system before making a decision, if you want a neutral position.

IMHO, *Bowling for Columbine* was interesting, and I think he deserved credit for making the thing.  It's still not necessarily a neutral documentary work (badgering an old, confused guy dying of Alzheimers is a pretty poor way of getting footage if you're trying to inform people), it at least raised interesting and worthwhile questions -- ""if Canada is similar in many ways to the US, why is gun crime much lower""?  *Fahrenheit 9/11* was pretty bad (lots of pretty lame insinuations of conspiracies and so forth), but it came out at a time when Bush was running horribly, horribly amok and we badly wanted someone, anyone, to criticize him harshly and publicly, and Moore was willing to do that.  I don't think that Moore did a great job, but there was a serious lack of people trying to do *exposes* on the Bush Administration during a time when a lot of people, like myself, were very frustrated.

*Sicko* was just *bad*.  It addressed a specific policy problem (""Should the US have a national health care system"") and left out all the hard data that would be necessary to make that call.  It mostly consisted of Moore sending out a call for people who were pissed off at the US health care system, identifying the worst-of-the-worst, and then filming teary shots of those people and then asked Cuba to let him film *their* system (not surprisingly, he got pretty nice footage) and a bunch of Europeans at parties and Canadians on golf courses saying ""gosh, our system seems like a good idea"".  Unlike *Bowling for Columbine*, where it's difficult to obtain all the relevant statistics, or *Fahrenheit 9/11*, where there weren't many to gather, *Sicko* should have been able to say ""here's the reason I feel we should provide national health care"" and slap some numbers up to support the argument.",1235359607,t1_c07twaj,0,True,politics,t1_c07tvu4,False,True,,t3_7zgfx,c07twaj,1425928542,0,
,0,1,t5_mouw,1,clumma,"&gt;so the solution would be to genetically test people to see whether they carry the predisposition gene and deny them the right to use opium or opium derivatives.

Just identifying them early and explaining it to them might go a long way.  Gene therapies might be developed.  Perhaps the right opioid receptor antagonist drug could be developed to be taken regularly, etc.  Or, we could just give them free morphine to take if they do become addicted, as is done in several European countries (or just legalize it so they can afford it as long as they can hold down a job, giving them an incentive to do so).  Even taking the worst possible policy, as we do today, opioid addiction is not worth mentioning on the top 1,000 list of problems in our society.  We've got poverty, violent crime, petty crime, routine neonatal circumcision, massive failure of the education system, diabetes epidemics, and on and on.

&gt;While I do agree that there is a genetic predisposition to many different types of addictions, are you sure you aren't overstating the significance of genetic factors?

Opioid addiction appears to be a very clear-cut case (they don't do anything for me for example, and it isn't for my lack of trying).  Other drugs less so.  But other drugs are not addictive to the same extent, either.  Nicotine is one of the worst ones, and it does seems to addict rather indiscriminately, though deep addiction only seems to develop before adulthood.

&gt;Lets be careful to differentiate between innovating and contributing to your field because of drug use, or innovating and contributing to your field in spite of drug use

Mullis, Francis Crick, the people I know personally, Vida Blue, and the Beatles, all cited drug use as a reason for their discoveries.  To the best of my knowledge, none of them wound up in trouble as a result of their drug use (except Ringo, where the drug was alcohol).

&gt;
&gt;So, in your view is this a problem or a solution? Do you suggest curbing this phenomenon or turning a blind eye to it?

I think most homeless people are mentally ill; if not when they started, by the time they've been at it a few years.  In certain areas, shanty towns may be a solution.  In others, mental institutions or live/work programs.  As for the drunken college kids, I think society needs to allow some sort of normative adolescent havoc-making.

You seemed to mention drug prohibition in general, and that has recently been extended to glassware (glassware has mysteriously become hard to obtain, and if it is seen from a window, is probable cause for search).

&gt;if I am in a public place or a restaurant, I don't want to have to move because you are inconveniencing me (and if smoking is rampant enough, actually harming my health). Your rights end where mine begin.

Agree.  And I support smoking bans in bars and such.  I think Berkeley went to far with its ""within 20 ft. of a doorway or ventilation duct"", which pretty much rules out the entire city.  Fortunately I have not seen that rule enforced.

&gt;If the majority of the U.S. lawmakers, representing their constituents, decide to pass a law decriminalizing (or legalizing) certain drug use, then I am not going to cry (too much, hehe) about it.

I was first pointing out that from a progressive Western view point a defacto dictatorship that uses widespread torture, hangs gays and shoot political dissidents is quite malevolent. So this is _domestic_ policies. Hopefully this is not disputable in the slightest. As to the malevolence of their foreign policy I thought I summed that up in the rest of my post, and as I stated their actions are mostly logical even though directed against our influence in the Middle East. So of course from the view point of Western government Iran's actions are malevolent, while the Iranians see it as a legitimate defence and expansion of their influence in the ME.

As to what other countries have done, that is not what we're discussing here. We're discussing Iran.

Iran has me worried because of their nuclear program, and I would like to see a peaceful solution to that.

Iran has several times pushed Hamas and Hizbollah into aggressive actions.

Yes. It's more powerful than you think.

We take this for granted as youth in the Western world, but for many it is not like this. You only need to travel a bit to see the longing for Western culture that exists, and especially in the Middle East.

""He surveys the world outside Eurasia and declares it deficient in proto-goats, proto-chickens, proto-pigs, proto-cows, proto-sheep… Make of this what you will, in essence it is hand-waving""

Diamond's main basis for the claim is the failure of modern domestication efforts of previously undomesticated species - calling attention to the difference between, for example, the temprements of different wild varieties of horses.  This is not addressed by this criticism.

""it is not a foregone conclusion that humans will set about domesticating them. It is simply not valid to read back from a present absence of domesticated animals a past dearth of proto-domestic animals.""

Again, what then accounts for the failure to domesticate these ""potentially useful"" animals by European colonists without a cultural equality with animals?  Diamond argues that they were not, in fact, useful.  

""...Diamond claims it necessarily follows from the all of the above that given such overwhelming, built-in Eurasian advantages (which somehow condensed to the particular advantage of the Western European part of Eurasia) that it was inevitable that that part of the world would become the global cradle of innovation, invention, and subsequent armed exploratory excursions on the part of its disease-ridden, disease-resistant, bristling-with-lethal-technology inhabitants. We know the rest. Bad news for the rest of the world’s inhabitants. Just as inherently smart, just as inherently plucky… but damned unlucky.""  

This statement of the thesis offers no criticims.  We know that these things did happen, and Diamond's thesis attempts to explain it more convincingly than a race-based thesis.  The final words of the review of the thesis simply state that, because this view would allow liberals to throw off their guilt because colonialism was the inevitable consequence of a power disparity, the theory should be discarded.  

This appears to start from the conclusion that, since it's obvious the colonisers were bad and we should feel bad about it, that the theory can't be true.  This says nothing about the truth or untruth of the thesis.  Like saying people should believe in God, otherwise they might not be good.


Furthermore, the thesis does not suggest that less fortunate cultures were, ""sorta pathetic,"" any more than someone not picking a winning lottery ticket is pathetic compared to a winner.

It sounds suspiciously as though the author dislikes the thesis because it contradicts his or her strong feeling that Europeans should carry guilt for the machiavellian actions of their ancestors.  Diamond's thesis no more justifies colonisation than evolution justifies eugenics or Newton's theory justifies pushing people out of windows.  It attempts to explain, not justify.

The anthropological criticisms are alluded to, but not expressed.  While I'm happy to admit that there are sound criticisms of the theory from anthropologists, I'd love to actually see them.",1235388330,t1_c07u2vz,0,True,science,t3_7zje6,False,True,,t3_7zje6,c07u2vz,1425928627,0,

Businesses turning over 45,000 pounds can claim it back on purchases but charge customers.

I used to do the VAT returns for our small business (you have to do them every month). You feel like a damn tax collector!

So the aim (as populist as it is) isn't aimed at Europeans.  It should be noted that there are a huge number of non European workers in the UK, Australians, Americans, Canadians etc... They are not anywhere as visible as the classic targets for this kind of rhetoric (eastern Europeans, Africans, Indians and Pakistanis) but there are a significant number.  

As to to ""The right to control that was signed away long ago"" you  are absolutely right, but then there are a large number of Brits living and working in Europe, so even if we could get out of out treaty obligations, the repercussions, as mbrowne points out above would probably be worse than any benefit in real terms, even if it were beneficial in political terms.

&gt;This is just pointless rhetoric.

It's not pointless rhetoric, it is a further indication that New Labour is sliding even more toward the right and an attempt at a popular move by a somewhat unpopular government.  Of course the question as to why Jaqui Smith and other policy makers working on security, employment and immigration policy ever found themselves within what was a Socialist party remains to be seen...

,0,6,t5_2qh13,6,turk440,"Just to make clear.  Turkish people support military intervention because our military only intervenes when the politicians get corrupt or sway the country far from what Attaturk wrote out as our Constitution.  For example the current party in power was once known as the Refat (changed name same ideology).  This party is known for its attachments to far right ideology, most of the country fear that they will bring Sharia style laws into play and because the left in Turkey is so divided and uncoordinated as multiple parties they are unable to stop this party passing such laws. What ends up happening is that the military keeps them in check of respecting the original draft of the constitution, which in every Coupe has reinstated.  As for the Xenophobia, I would address this as left over effect of the fact that the country was going to be carved up when it was still the Ottoman Empire.  Alot of Turks died to protect and create modern Turkey.  In the End the more that Turkey is pushed to be something its not to get into the EU the further they strain Turkey's secular democratic make up.  It has only been in the recent 15 or so years that Right wing has had so much influence in Turkish politics.  This is just my perspective.vv",1235404255,t1_c07u6g5,0,False,worldnews,t1_c07u425,False,True,,t3_7zjbc,c07u6g5,1425928672,0,

Actually, US currency paper is a blend of cotton and linen.

2. The 57 on Heinz ketchup bottle represents the varieties 
of pickles the company once had. 
False. H J Heinz's own story is that he liked an ad that said 
""21 different styles of shoes."" He had well more than 57 
varieties of product, but he liked the number because it 
sounded large without sounding huge.

3. Your stomach produces a new layer of mucus every two weeks 
-- otherwise it will digest itself. 
True

4. The Declaration of Independence was written on hemp paper. 
The first two drafts were written on hemp paper. About 
200 copies of the Declaration were printed (25 survive) on 
paper that may or may not contain hemp. A calligraphic copy 
was made after the printing and signed; this is the document 
on display in Philadelphia. It is on vellum parchment (animal skin).

5. The dot over the letter 'i' is called a ""tittle"". 
True

6. A raisin dropped in a glass of fresh champagne will bounce 
up and down continuously from the bottom of the glass to the top. 
Sometimes, depending on the raisin and the champagne. After 
a while it becomes soaked and sinks to the bottom and you have 
to suck it up with a straw. 

7. Susan Lucci is the daughter of Phyllis Diller. 
False, though Diller does have a daughter named Suzanne.

8. A duck's quack doesn't echo ... no one knows why. 
False

9. 40% of McDonald's profits come from the sales of Happy Meals. 
Probably false. Profits are one thing, sales another. Though the 
60s and 70s, major profits came through real estate and franchise 
fees. Over the last few years McDonald's has found it tough to be 
profitable. Happy Meals, introduced 1979, were a major sales 
boost, but so were McNuggets (1984). As a share of sales, Happy 
Meals probably aren't 40% except for unusual short term spurts 
(such as the Teeny Beanie toy that sold out in two weeks) though 
McD's sells enough to be one of the world's major distributors of 
small toys.

10. Every person has a unique tongue print (no licking at the 
scene of a crime!). 
More or less true.

11. 315 entries in Webster's 1996 Dictionary were misspelled. 
""Webster's"" is not a copyrighted term. Any dictionary can call 
itself Webster's. So which one of hundreds misspelled words?

12. The 'spot' on 7UP comes from its inventor who had red eyes. 
He was albino. 
False. 7up, created by non-albino Charles Grigg and originally 
known as ""Bib-Label Lithiated Lemon-Lime Soda,"" was introduced 
two weeks before the great stock market crash of 1929. In 1936, 
the name became 7up. The logo had a white ""7UP"" on a rectangular 
red background for many years. Sometimes, on specific products, 
the background was a red circle. The circle became a dot around 
1970. 

13. On average, 12 newborns will be given to the wrong parents 
daily. 
Seriously doubtful.

14. During the chariot scene in 'Ben Hur' a small red car can 
be seen in the distance. 
False. Not only does the red van NOT appear during the chariot 
race, but its appearance would have been literally IMPOSSIBLE...
since the background outside the arena is actually a mattte 
painting!(see the 1994 documentary, ""Ben Hur: The Making of an Epic""). 

15. Warren Beatty and Shirley MacLaine are brother and sister. 
True

16. Chocolate affects a dog's heart and nervous system; a few 
ounces will kill a small sized dog. 
True. Ferrets, too.

17. Orcas (killer whales) kill sharks by torpedoing up into 
the shark's stomach from underneath, causing the shark to explode. 
Only if you believe Flipper. Killer whales breach through ice, 
so they have the capacity to do this, but they seldom battle 
sharks. No one has ever witnessed an exploding shark.

18. Most lipstick contains fish scales. 
True (""pearlessence"" is derived from fish scales).

19. Donald Duck comics were banned from Finland because he 
doesn't wear pants. 
False. Nor were they banned because Donald and Daisy 
weren't married.

20. Ketchup was sold in the 1830s as medicine. 
True (Dr. Miles Compound Extract of Tomato)

21. Upper and lower case letters are named 'upper' and 'lower' 
because in the time when all original print had to be set in 
individual letters, the 'upper case' letters were stored in 
the case on top of the case that stored the smaller, 
'lower case' letters. 
True

22. Leonardo Da Vinci could write with one hand and draw with 
the other at the same time. 
Supposedly true but not reported by an eye-witness.

23. Because metal was scarce, the Oscars given out during 
World War II were made of wood. 
False, they were made of plaster.

24. There are no clocks in Las Vegas gambling casinos. 
True (or used to be).

25. The name Wendy was made up for the book Peter Pan, there 
was never a recorded Wendy before! 
False

26. There are no words in the dictionary that rhyme with: orange, 
purple, and silver! 
True regarding a ""perfect rhyme."" However ""orange"" and ""silver"" 
have half-rhymes (such as lozenge with orange and salver with 
silver), are technically speaking, pararhymes, or considered a 
half-rhyme.  Words that rhyme with ""purple"" are Steve Urkel, 
hurtful, circle and are also ""half-rhymes."".

27. Leonardo Da Vinci invented scissors. Also, it took him 
10 years to paint Mona Lisa's lips. 
False. Scissors were around for centuries before Da Vinci and 
he worked on the Mona Lisa, off and on, for three or four years.

28. A tiny amount of liquor on a scorpion will make it instantly 
go mad and sting itself to death. 
False. The notion of a scorpion stinging itself to death is an 
ancient allegory. That is, if it is surrounded by fire or by 
enemies, or even if one puts liquor or alcohol on a scorpion 
that these things will cause it to sting itself is a falsehood. 
It is untrue since the venom has no effect on the scorpion itself, 
nor on any member of the same species.

29. The mask used by Michael Myers in the original ""Halloween"" 
was a Captain Kirk mask painted white. 
True

30. If you have three quarters, four dimes, and four pennies, 
you have $1.19. You also have the largest amount of money in 
coins without being able to make change for a dollar. 
True

31. By raising your legs slowly and lying on your back, you can't 
sink in quicksand. 
True. The fact is that most people can float on quicksand. It 
actually holds you up better than water. If you ever find yourself 
stuck in quicksand, try not to panic. Try gently falling backward 
spread-eagled. You may eventually have to roll or swimvery slowly
to solid ground.If you find yourself only in quicksand up to your 
waist, you will experience a vacuum when trying to remove your leg 
from the quicksand. To release the vacuum, slowly move your leg. 
Remember, quick movements will make the situation worse.

32. The phrase ""rule of thumb"" is derived from an old English law, 
which stated that you couldn't beat your wife with anything wider 
than your thumb. 
False. This notion was invented in 19th Century Britain to defend 
the notion of wife-beating. It was soon shown to be a fallacy. 
""Rule of thumb"" comes from the fact that the final thumb joint is 
about an inch, so is used as a rough measuring guide. ""Thumb"" and 
""inch"" are the same word in several European languages (French, 
Danish, Swedish, etc.)

33. American Airlines saved $40,000 in '87 by eliminating one 
olive from each salad served in first class. 
True

34. The first product Motorola started to develop was a record 
player for automobiles. At that time, the most known player on the 
market was the Victrola, so they called themselves Motorola. 
False. The company was founded by Paul V. Galvin as the Galvin 
Manufacturing Corporation, in Chicago, Illinois, in 1928. Its 
first product was a ""battery eliminator,"" allowing consumers to 
operate radios directly from household current instead of the 
batteries supplied with early models. In the 1930s, the company 
successfully commercialized car radios under the brand name ""Motorola,"" 
a word suggesting sound in motion.

35. Celery has negative calories! It takes more calories to eat 
a piece of celery than the celery has in it to begin with. It's 
the same with apples! 
True. (But it's not just the chewing; it's the chewing and the 
digesting that burns up the 6 calories per stalk).

36. Chewing gum while peeling onions will keep you from crying! 
The latest how-to-peel-onions-without-crying trick! 
False (but your breath will smell better).

37. The glue on Israeli postage stamps is certified kosher. 
Not really. Israel, like the US, uses vegetable glue on its 
stamps. Theoretically everything in Israel is kosher, but 
this is now a political issue with ""true"" kosher shops 
hanging out haredi signs.

38. Guinness Book of Records holds the record for being the book 
most often stolen from Public Libraries. 
False. The American Library Association did a survey a few years 
ago. According to Larra Clark, ALA press officer, the titles 
most likely to go AWOL (absent without librarian) are books 
about dreams, witchcraft, astrology and the occult.

39. Back in the mid to late 80's, an IBM compatible computer 
wasn't considered a hundred percent compatible unless it could 
run Microsoft's Flight Simulator game. 
Sort of. In 1983, when Flight Simulator was introduced, standards 
were still a bit loose. If your machine could run Flight Simulator 
and Lotus 1-2-3, then it was probably compatible.

40. Astronauts are not allowed to eat beans before they go into 
space! Passing wind in a space suit damages them. 
False. Three days before a flight, astronauts are put on a ""low 
residue diet"" so their diaper-style undies won't fill up so fast. 
If gas could damage a space suit there'd be a lot more astronaut 
fatalities. In 1968 the New York Academy of Sciences held a 
symposium on gastrointestinal gas, in part to examine fears 
that astronauts might asphyxiate themselves. As we all know, 
they don't.
