He returned to California and topped himself, RIP.  Ironically, with a handgun.  I was left with the weapons.

I've refused to sell them, as he made clear he'd wanted me to have them; when his (psychologically also broken) widow asked for them back, I gave her all but the guns that made up the value of the money I'd lent him; before leaving, he'd explained to me which guns she'd favored -- she got all of those.

I'd be curious to see this harder cut of the film, as I thought the US PG-13 release was pretty satisfyingly brutal, albeit with almost no gore at all.",1233481067,1,1,t5_2qh0s,clintisiceman

I think you would need to provide some sort of evidence for this outrageous statement.

The support for israel by the EU, UK, and the US has never waned no matter who said what, no matter what israel does.

&gt;If you agree with me that the treatment of Palestinians is unconscionable then you have nothing to fear from being honest and only stand to lose if you are not careful or not thoughtful in your thinking.

I disagree. 

Being meek has never really accomplished much in this world.

&gt;If I were to say this is an attack on the free press I could counter that allegation by saying it was a closed door event which it was - and people will consider everything else in raised in this incident, rightly or wrongly, compromised. That is why I raised it myself, to prevent this from happening.

I don't know what you mean by free press but my definition says this was an attack on the free press.

And yet look what has happened.  The US has elected somebody president who made a point of trying to open up avenues of diplomacy with Iran and the streets of capital cities across Europe have been filled by protests.  Israel is facing a MASSIVE PR crisis...look at Reddit...normal people not buying into the hype.  Look at the stories submitted, the world's press is coming round.  Calls for inquiries, international condemnation.

Things are changing and yet you seem to keep wanting to whine about what has happened in the past.  That's not going to help anyone; instead try empowering the growing movement to start holding Israel accountable.

&gt;I disagree. Being meek has never really accomplished much in this world.

Being honest and being thoughtful about how you present your argument does mean being 'meek'.

You just disagreed with being HONEST.  You're part of the problem.  If you can only argue or exact changes by being dishonest or reverting to that which you oppose then you're already losing.  If you can't be honest and intelligent you are not helping anyone, certainly not your cause.  In fact even I am starting to question whether you want to stop all attacks on Palestine or really you want to lever support for attacks on Israel.  Because for one of those you're onto a winner, the other and you're facing your own PR disaster.

&gt;I don't know what you mean by free press but my definition says this was an attack on the free press.

Free press does not mean a right to go wherever the press chooses.  They can't break into your home, they can't do anything illegal or force themselves into a private meeting.  That is not what free press means.  This wasn't a public meeting so the rights of the free press where not crossed here.  They had no right to be there other than by invite which is why he had a right to not be filmed and why he was allowed to make the request for cameras to be switched off.

With Israel banning reporters from going to Gaza however, they had no such right.  The reporters had a right to go there and they were denied.

It does matter, it's human history. 

I do agree that wether or not the numbers are accurate, the crime remains the same. 

But I also find historical accuracy to be extremely important. 

And when you actually study the Holocaust, you have to come to the conclusion that the numbers don't add up, and what this man says about cyanide being too impractical for gas-chambers is also true. There are many other arguments too. For instance, there weren't 6,000,000 jews in the entirety of Europe at that time. 

The estimates are based on the most ridiculous math I've ever seen.

And the Nuremberg trials, which used only solid evidence, are another great source of information that doesn't correspond to the official story. 

Coming to logical conclusions based on the study of history doesn't make you an anti-semite just because your conclusions aren't the same as the ""official story"". 

I'll be the first to admit that Nazis were putting jews into concentration camps, denying them all rights and killed a great number of them in horrible ways. 

We're still finding mass graves in places like Poland and the Ukraine:

http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/persecution/pch0209.htm

But that doesn't mean I should say that I agree with something that doesn't make sense to me or that I should refrain from speaking about it.

This man said something about the holocaust in a certain context, and this is being used in a different context to make him look like an anti-semite. 

Maybe he is one, I have no idea. But truth does matter to many of us. Anti-semite or jewish, like I am.

Just as one doesn't have to see goose-stepping soldiers down the high street before a nation is considered fascist a right to vote is not the be-all and end-all decider to whether an association with apartheid is correct.  I'm sure you are aware that when citizenship is taken is Israel a Palestinian's nationality is noted as Arab and an Jewish Israeli is noted as Jew - that right there marks the beginning of what unravels into apartheid.

Israel's nationality laws prevents a Palestinian citizen of Israel married to someone from the OT from living together in Israel.  Apartheid South Africa's supreme court overturned that.  [Israel's high court upheld it in 2006 and again in 2008](http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/996697.html) - in case you missed it that was an Israeli newspaper using the 'A' word.  [Marriage laws](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-imposes-racist-marriage-law-588637.html), sure a Palestinian and an Israeli can marry but a 12y.o. child from such a marriage must emigrate.   Then there are the agricultural laws that denote certain land as Jewish and so can't be sold to non-Jews, and what is the nationality of a Palestinian come Israeli citizen known as again: Arab.  Then there are the ""Arab free"" industries, for those in the military and security.  

[Then there are the building permits and incentives...again nationality is seen to be a prerequisite, or rather a 'Jewish' nationality identity.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/feb/06/southafrica.israel)

[And unfortunately if one moves from focusing on the inequality in Israel to the West Bank it gets even worse...](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/this-is-like-apartheid-anc-veterans-visit-west-bank-865063.html)

It goes on.  Some measures get overturned, like the recent banning of Arab parties in next month's election, some don't.  It is important however to mention that that doesn't mean all Israelis should be tarred with the same brush.  [They shouldn't.  Just as in all walks in life there are differences and I believe in empowering Israeli moderates who know something is amiss.](http://www.acri.org.il/eng/Story.aspx?id=351)

&gt;You are very apt to dismiss what Hamas says. Go back and watch the video AGAIN.

No, I very appropriately provided you with an article that establishes what Hamas means between 'accept' and 'acknowledge'.  That and the [MEMRI](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLFd4dlHPnc) source (dude I wouldn't go and post a stormfront article to argue how Israel was bad...hopefully we both acknowledge they can't be trusted.  [Memri translations, editing, cherry picking and context cannot be trusted](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/jan/28/israel2)) Hamas leadership has even reiterated their willingness to accept Israel since the recent escalation to French and UK delegates on behalf of the EU.

&gt;I answered my view on 1967 border in separate thread.

Y'up well that's the direction you need to be headed because in all honesty Israel's PR skirt is slipping in light of recent events.  America itself is in trouble and radicalising serves no purpose.  Israel will be best served to locate itself peacefully into a post-American Israeli era.  It would be far easier than to not and to look for them in times of trouble and to find them not there.

""Unregulated Corporations Will Not Always Act In The Public Interest.""

Don't get me wrong, neither will anybody else. Consumers will buy cheaper goods from overseas whenever practical. Small businesses will always try (and it's wise to do so) to reduce expenses, including employee health care, wages and other benefits. I don't even have to mention politicians and lawyers.

But somehow a lot of people refuse to believe my headline. They like to blame our failing auto industry on the workers, ignoring how the currently successful auto industries compensate their workers -- Japanese auto workers are some of the best compensated in the country, and they got a (slight, but) pay raise in '07. Europeans get universal health care and famously generous vacation time. 

We buy their cars not because they're cheaper up front, but because they usually prove cheaper in the long run. The only car I've ever truly *loved* was my Flamin' Chicken (see Apu), but my Civic refused to break and my Mazda hasn't needed a single repair in 64,000 miles. 

That's just one example where axiomatic philosophies get thrown around instead of facing some tough facts. (And a lot of those philosophies have their roots in that ""dismal science,"" economics. Anyone who's actually studied economics knows this joke: ""What do you get when you put three economists in a room? Four opinions."")

Nobody's misrepresenting you.  Well you are misrepresenting you but that's your problem.  What is not your problem is Fatah and Hamas squabbling.  Israel should have invited them to Annapolis but it is never too late.  Be the mature party - establish what they both ask for 1967 borders and let them be at each others throats in their own recognised country.

...what do you want?!!!

&gt;**The best solution is to give Gaza to Egypt and the West Bank to Jordan which is anyway 75% Palestinean. Having Hamastan and Fatahland is a recipe for trouble.**

Who are you to decide that?  If Palestinians want Palestine, Jordan wants a Palestine, Egypt wants a Palestine and they are all saying that it will be outside 1967 borders and Israel needn't be effected - then let there be a Palestine.  *I think we just hit on the crux here.*

&gt;**You conviniently forget that fact that Israel withdrew from all Gaza in 2005.**

Not really, when you launch airstrikes, control the borders, the ports, the airspace, the taxes; Israel left Gaza as much as in the sense that a bully leaves a kid when he stops punching him in the face to stand on his throat.  Please, Israel withdrawing from Gaza in 2005 and watching a progressive humanitarian crisis of her making unfold, is no rallying point for morality.

&gt;**If Hamas would have not attack Israel for almost 3 years with Qassams and build a society with the billions from the EU and US, they would not been poor, cold and hungry.**

Oh please stop pretending.  Drop the blockade.
3 years of Qassams ignores that they were keeping to the ceasefire.  They weren't the ones to break it either; Israel was.

&gt;**But they choose to decapitate Fatah in Gaza, replace the PA there as the ruler and follow the path of Jihad with the support of many if not most of Gaza people.**

See now you're just making yourself look silly.  The EU and the UN both sent inspectors to the democratic election.  [Both reported back that it was fair and open](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_elections_of_2006#Conduct_of_the_poll) even though [Israel decided to order polling stations open longer in areas strong with Fatah support, closing Hamas polling booths in East Jerusalem and restricting Hamas campaigners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_elections_of_2006#Voting_in_East_Jerusalem).  Hamas won.  Decapitation...you mean an election.

&gt;**""So please do not post propaganda about Israel's attrocities.""** 

NOBODY NEEDS TO.  ISRAEL'S ATROCITIES SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES (but the UN, Haaretz and numerous humanitarian groups - International and Israel, help)

&gt;**The reality is that nobody is blameless**

True.

&gt;**in order for things to change Hamas MUST stop supporting and abetting attacks against Israel.**

They did, it was called a ceasefire, it was working too despite Israel not opening up the borders as it said it would.  *Then Israel broke it November 4th.* Been downhill since then really...

&gt;**But doing so, it will finish its raison d'etre, isn't it?**

Not true.  They are high in the polls, they have a new raison d'être, being a political party for Palestinians. Just like Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland.  See? Their willingness to accept Israel, in Arabic or English - you have a choice now :)

&gt;**If they or any faction under their rule are tacitly encouraged to continue, they need to be kept responsible as the ruler in Gaza.**

Then how about a little tip?  Next time when they are arresting non-Hamas paramilitaries  trying to break the ceasefire try giving them a hand.  You know, little things like opening the borders so the people are starving and lashing out in desperation any way they can or sympathising for those making rockets in their lockups or their kitchens.  Small things like not standing on the fuel line into Gaza (fuel paid for by the EU by the way).  But look at the success they had, look at how rocket attacks dropped off and stayed dropped before Israel broke the ceasefire, quite considerable.  But these groups, these cells, are difficult to detect on anyone's radar...but they were doing it.  Now you've just blown up a load of policemen, smashed the infrastructure, killed elements of the political party and its buildings....ISRAEL JUST WEAKENED THE ONE GROUP WHO WERE STOPPING THE ROCKETS.

Well done...anybody would have thought you didn't want a peace if it meant an actual Palestinian state.  *Back to the crux again*

How can you use that excuse when the rockets were stopped and Israeli intelligence admits Hamas was not firing any rockets during the ceasefire and when Fatah admit that Hamas had arrested her paramilitaries trying to attack Israel from Gaza.  

*Israel broke the ceasefire.*

&gt;**to strengthen Hamas so that they will have more Grads and Shihabs to hit every town in Israel. Your logic is just incredible and it is in line with the Quireish situation that Arafat said and delivered upon.**

Hamas, although not being an admirable political party, did not break the ceasefire, did offer to recognise Israel and this message has been repeated in English and Arabic and passed on to Jewish and EU representatives.

-To alienate Hamas?  Failed.  

-To keep the world's press on side and to not have mass protests and people questioning their support for Israel?  Faaaailed.

&gt;THE MYTH OF STALIN'S 'DEMORALISATION' IN 1941

INTRODUCTION

In his secret speech to the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in February 1956, First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev alleged that, following the German attack upon the Soviet Union in June 1941, Stalin became 'for a long time inactive' as a result of 'demoralisation':

""After the first severe disaster and defeat at the front Stalin thought that this was the end. In one of his speeches in those days he said: 'All that Lenin created we have lost forever...'

After this Stalin, for a long time actually ...ceased to do anything whatever...""

(Nikita S. Krushchev: 'The Secret Speech to the Closed Session of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union'; Nottingham; 1976; p. 53).

Note: this agrees with much other data about what happened, and there were many very valid reasons that Stalin did not trust ANY ""intelligence reports"" coming from ANY Western source, no matter who told him. However please note this new information:

Stalin's Appointment Diary

However, new material emanating recently from the former Soviet Union demonstrates that

Far from disappearing and hiding either in his private apartments in the Kremlin or to his dacha at Kuntsevo, certainly during the first week of the Soviet-German War, Stalin would appear to have stuck to a very arduous work routine, displaying little of the panic and fear that is generally attributed to him, both by previous Western and Russian historians"".

(Steven J. Main: 'Stalin in June 1941: A Comment on Cynthia Roberts', in: 'Europe-Asia Studies', Volume 48, No.5 (July 1996); p.837).

Steven Main, of the University of Edinburgh, who has recently researched Stalin's appointments diaries for the period concerned, testifies that these diaries show that

""... On the very first day of the war (22 June). Stalin's official working day began at 05.45 and ended at 16.45...

""Stalin held meetings with a variety of senior Soviet government and military figures, including Molotov (People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs), Timoshenko (People's Commissar for Defence), Zhukov (Chief of Staff of the Red Army), Kuznetsov (Commander of both North Caucasus and Baltic Military Districts), and Shaposhnikov (Deputy People's Commissar for Defence). All in all, on the very first day of the attack, Stalin held meetings with over 15 individual members of the Soviet government and military apparatus"".

(Steven J. Main: ibid.; 1). 837, citing '1zvestiya 'TsK KPSS', Volume 6, 1990; p. 216-22).

However, according to Marshal Georgi Zhukov, on the first day of the war Stalin's working day was even longer than was shown in his appointments diary. Zhukov relates in his memoirs that he spoke with Stalin on the telephone at thirty minutes after midnight:

""Everything was now pointing to the fact that German forces were moving up to the frontier. At 30 minutes past midnight we notified Stalin. Stalin enquired whether the directive had been sent to all districts.

I replied in the affirmative.""

(Georgi Zhukov: 'The Memoirs of Marshal Zhukov'; London; 197 1; p. 234).

And then, at 3.30 a.m., Zhukov ordered Stalin to be awakened:

""At 3. 30 a.m. ... the Commissar of Defence ordered me to phone Stalin. I start calling . . . Finally, I heard the sleep-dulled voice of the general on duty in the security section. I ask him to call Stalin on the phone.

""About three minutes later Stalin picked up the receiver."" Georgi Zhukov: ibid.; p. 235).

The appointments diary further reveals that during the opening week of the war.

""Stalin's officially recorded shortest working day was 24 June, lasting a little over five hours, but this followed a working day (23 June) that apparently fell just short of 24 hours -- 22 hours and 35 minutes!""

(Steven J. Main: op. Cit.; p. 837, citing 'Izvestia TsK KPSS', Volume 6, 1990, p. 217).

Similarly, on 25 / 26 June,

""Stalin is on record as having 24 hours of meetings"".

(Steven I. Main: ibid.; p.837 citing 'Izvestia lsK KPSS', Volume 6, 1990, p. 218-19).

On both 26 and 27 June

""his recorded working days ran to a little over ten hours each and, possibly as a result of this physically and mentally puniishing schedule. his working day for 28 June again lasted a little over 5 hours"". (Steven J. Main: ibid.; p. 837, citing 'Izvestiya TsK KPSS'. Volume 6, 1990, p.218-19).

Thus, in sum total, of 168 hours (representing the entire week 22-28 June inclusive)

""Stalin is officially recorded as holding meetings totalling 88 hours and 40 minutes in duration"". (Steven J. Main: ibid.; p. 837. citing: Colonel-General Yu. Gorkov: Verkhovnyi I Stavka', in: 'Krasnaya zvezda', 21 October 1995).

In overall terms,

""... Stalin held 158 meetings, involving 45 named senior government and military figures during this entire period"".

(Steven I. Main: ibid.; p. 837, citing: Colonel-General Yu. Gorkov ibid.).

Thus, as attested by, amongst others, Molotov:

""It is wrong to say he (Stalin - Ed.) was confused; he was worried, but he did not show it. To say that he was not worried would be ridiculous. But writers portray him in a way that he wasn't, like a repentant sinner! This is, of course, absurd. During all this time, as always, he worked, he did not lose control of himself and he certainly did not lose the power of speech"".

(Steven J. Main: ibid.; p. 838, citing Feliks Chuev: Sto sorok besed s Molotovym'; in: Kommunist vooruzhenuykh sil', Volume 9. 1991: pp. 62-63).

Main sums up his researches as follows.

""Thus, judging by his appointments diary, as well as the statements of his contemporaries, the important measures adopted by both the party and the state, etc., the view that Stalin locked himself away for any length of time during this critical opening period of the Soviet-German War would appear to be no longer tenable"".

(Steven J. Main: ibid.; p. 838).""

Hamas elected not to renew the 6 month ceasefire.  Israel elected to break it in month 5, on November 4th having not acknowledged their end of the agreement by raising travel restrictions in both directions.  There had been incidents before then, 7 from Israel in the first month alone, but nothing that couldn't be put down to twitchy soldier fingers, nothing officially sanctioned.

November 4th changed that.  The Israeli government sanctioned air strikes and an incursion into Gaza.

ISRAEL *BROKE* THE CEASEFIRE.

&gt;I want a durable peace not the ""peace of our times"" type (reference N. Chamberlain). That is why I suggest giving Gaza to the Egyptians and the West Bank to Jordan, the most realistic and reasonable solution.

They are not yours to give.  They are Palestinian people on lands which many of them hold deeds to (in fact many of them hold deeds to land in Israel for that matter - see [Israeli absentee property laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_and_property_laws_in_Israel#The_.27Absentees_Property_Law.27) which don't even require the owner to be absent for it to be seized - 30,000 fell into that category!!!)

You can't give what is not yours.  If Palestinians want Palestine what concern is it of yours?

&gt;While you overlook the problems on one side and put the onus only on Israel, I am trying to suggest, unsuccessfully, that this is a two way street.

You're doing no such thing.  **The two way street is Hamas/Fatah must stop attacking Israel and accept it whilst Israel must stop attacking Palestinians and accept them.**

Hamas and Fatah have both said they would accept Israel within 1967 borders and they would bring peace.

You want to give Gaza to Egypt, West Bank to Jordan, to not recognise Palestine, keep East Jerusalem which cements a war crime under the Geneva Convention whilst presumably keeping up with the current apartheid issues currently existing in Israel to maintain a Jewish majority.

It is a two way street.  Post-Zionist Israelis, Fatah, Hamas, the Arab League all accept the above bold.  Middle East peace envoy Tony bloody Blair has even just come out and said, 

&gt;[the diplomatic Quartet - Europe, Russia, the United States and United Nations - would deal with Hamas if it accepts a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.](http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-world/hamas-would-recognise-pre1967-israel-20090129-7s62.html)

Well they just said they would - to a whole bunch of European delegates too!So that's what: 

The 2 main Palestinian political parties, 21 Arab countries, the Russians, 27 European countries, the United States of America and the United Nations - all going in one direction down this 2 way street.  

The one country that isn't is the one that broke the ceasefire to carry out an extension of its ethnic cleansing in what one [Israeli official](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cznZs-swR9k) admits is already showing the promise of breaking out into other arenas.

Way to go Israel...the 2 way street is this way.  

&gt;BTW, your friends from Lebanon are ready to put gas on fire http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3665177,00.html

Oh so now you're just gunning with ad hominems and saying my friends in Lebanon and linking to Hezbollah threats.  *Classy*

You want me to denounce all strikes against Israel and Israelis again? I do, I really do.  No matter how badly the Israeli government has treated both the Lebanese and the Palestinians I don't think firing back is either productive or justified.  That goes for everybody.  The only thing is, what I condemn in them, I have to condemn in Israel too.  If it seems I'm being disproportionate that is only because I AM RESPONDING IN PROPORTION TO THE ATTACKS THAT ARE MADE. 

Incidentally even after the IDF worked its magic on Lebanon I look at where Israel's administration is taking it, the apartheid (which you kinda just dropped off and didn't follow up on), the bellicosity, the arrests of war protesters for days, the war crimes, the propaganda....and as messed up as it may seem, I'd feel easily much safer as an informed Western European in Lebanon than I would Israel.  

I'm genuinely concerned for her welfare - I'm especially concerned for her moderates (of which Israel has a wealth), in history they're usually the next to be persecuted after the projected ethnicity threat.  I wish you could step back and see her administration through the eye's of the world.    You'd agree: I hope.",1233527051,1,1,t5_2qh13,porkchopprime

Louisiana Purchase - Hmmm, don't think they were using oil at that point. And what part of it has a significant amount of oil? The purchase was made because it was incredibly cheap (a few cents an acre) and because if the US didn't take it then the British might have taken it (though it's hard to imagine Napoleon would have sold it to his enemy, stranger things have happened in European politics).

New Deal - The Social Security Ponzi scheme? Yeah, you're gonna find out pretty soon why this is one of the worst things the government could have ever done. National Highways? They effectively destroyed small town America and created highly wasteful and unsustainable suburban sprawl, all in the name of defending against invasion (from where?!). You're gonna find out soon why this too was a really bad idea, if you haven't already.

Marshall Plan - Effectively reigned in the economies of western Europe, basically forcing them to be client states. It can be argued that they were better off under our rule than that of the Soviets, but that doesn't excuse what it really is: economic empire-building (and they *hardly* paid us back).

NASA - Yeah, they did a good job in the beginning, as far as advancing our understanding of the universe and whatnot. However, it has grown to become a bureaucratic giant.

BRADDOCK, Pa. — As Americans wonder just how horrible the economy will become, this tiny steel town offers a perverse message of hope: Things cannot possibly get any worse than they are here.
 
Lisa Kyle for The New York Times
The mayor, John Fetterman, with tattoos of the dates of killings during his time in office.
 
Hunched on the eastern edge of the Monongahela River only a few miles from bustling Pittsburgh, Braddock is a mix of boarded-up storefronts, houses in advanced stages of collapse and vacant lots.

The state has classified it a “distressed municipality” — bankrupt, more or less — since the Reagan administration. The tax base is gone. So are most of the residents. The population, about 18,000 after World War II, has declined to less than 3,000. Many of those who remain are unemployed. Real estate prices fell 50 percent in the last year.

“Everyone in the country is asking, ‘Where’s the bottom?’ ” said the mayor, John Fetterman. “I think we’ve found it.”

Mr. Fetterman is trying to make an asset out of his town’s lack of assets, calling it “a laboratory for solutions to all these maladies starting to knock on the door of every community.” One of his first acts after being elected mayor in 2005 was to set up, at his own expense, a Web site to publicize Braddock — if you can call pictures of buildings destroyed by neglect and vandals a form of promotion.

He has encouraged the development of urban farms on empty lots, which employ area youths and feed the community. He started a nonprofit organization to save a handful of properties.

In an earlier era, Braddock was a famed wellspring of industrial might. The steel baron Andrew Carnegie put his first mill in the town, the foundation of an empire that helped build modern America. With the loot and guilt Mr. Carnegie piled up, he also built a library here, the first of more than 1,500 Carnegie libraries in the United States.

Immigrants came to work in the mill, and through ceaseless agitation won union representation that enabled their children — helped by the library on the hill — to achieve a better life.

A local boy, Thomas Bell, celebrated this hard-won success in his autobiographical 1941 novel “Out of This Furnace.” The story recounts the strivings of three generations in Braddock’s mill and their transformation from exploited and maligned “Hunkies” from Eastern Europe into full-fledged Americans.

This year, the town will be featured in the film version of another work of art, Cormac McCarthy’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel “The Road.” Set in a post-Armageddon America where food is so scarce that many survivors turned to cannibalism, “The Road” was shot partially in Braddock.

A town whose story has evolved from building America to making Americans to eating Americans for dinner might seem a hard sell. So Mr. Fetterman, who is paid $150 a month, also promotes Braddock as a place to buy extremely cheap real estate.

Erik and Shannon Gustafson heeded that call. The couple were living in Chicago, where Mr. Gustafson was a part-time commodities trader, when they heard about Braddock last winter. They settled on a two-bedroom house whose owner warned them that it had black mold and was probably a tear-down. Her price: $4,750.

The Gustafsons paid the money and discovered that the mold problem was overstated. “Space is cheap here,” said Mr. Gustafson, 30. “We can afford to focus on our hobbies.” He is a graphic designer; she is a photographer.

Joel Rice, a furniture maker, bought a 15,000-square-foot former car dealership that he is converting to a showroom, workshop and home, with a greenhouse on the roof. The building cost $70,000, perhaps a tenth of what he would have had to pay for a tiny shop in Oregon, where he was living.

It will take at least two more years to clear the debris and put in new wiring, plumbing and fixtures. But Mr. Rice, 38, is undaunted. “If all our effort here crashes and burns,” he said, “it won’t be because we held anything back.”

Unlike many stricken steel towns, Braddock never lost its mill. Part of the U.S. Steel system, it still employs nearly a thousand workers. But they no longer live in town, and the stores followed them to the suburbs. Eventually, only the stubborn and those without resources remained.

“Even the bars and liquor stores closed,” said Ron Kutnansky, who was born in Braddock in 1953 and lived there and in North Braddock for decades.

A custodian at the University of Pittsburgh, Mr. Kutnansky finally moved out three years ago, after his home was broken into for the third time. “It’s a fairly big shame what happened to Braddock,” he said. He sold his house for a dollar, no regrets.


The mill town once had 18,000 residents.
 
Now it has 3,000 and is full of abandoned buildings.
 
As Mr. Kutnansky was leaving, a political novice was starting to shake things up. Mr. Fetterman, now 39, is hard to miss, at 6-foot-8 and 325 pounds, with a shaved head and goatee. He has a master’s degree in public policy from Harvard but came to Braddock in 2001 to work for a county youth program. He won the May 2005 Democratic primary by exactly one vote. (He faced no opposition in the general election.)

The mayor wears his commitment to Braddock not on his sleeve but under it: On his right arm are tattooed five dates memorializing killings in Braddock during his time in office. The victims included a man delivering a pizza and a 2-year-old girl who was assaulted and then dropped into a snow-covered playground. She froze to death while trying to walk home.

On his other arm is a large 15104, the town’s ZIP code.

This impressed many of the younger residents. “I was shocked, because he’s not even from around here,” said Jeremy Cannon, 23.

Mr. Fetterman’s official powers are limited, partly because of Braddock’s “distressed municipality” status and partly because it is technically a borough overseen by a borough council. The council president, Jesse Brown, did not return telephone calls for an interview.

Mostly, the mayor offers encouragement, ideas and energy. With the financial help of his father, who owns a commercial insurance agency in York, Pa., he also makes direct and indirect investments in local real estate. He set up the nonprofit organization, Braddock Redux, and gave it $50,000 to buy a former Presbyterian church to serve as a community center.

Last year, Mr. Fetterman gave the organization another $12,000 — money he says he got by draining his 401(k) — to buy a duplex and another house next door. The next step was securing a grant from the Buhl Foundation in Pittsburgh to refurbish the buildings for six at-risk teenagers who, at 18, were too old for foster care. Run by two members of AmeriCorps, the group house will open this month.

“Where a lot of people would see a series of negatives — a bankrupt community with deteriorating housing, foster kids aging out of the system and confronting a lack of employment — John saw potential,” said Frederick Thieman, president of the Buhl Foundation.

One of Mr. Fetterman’s biggest coups was persuading a small alternative energy company, Fossil Free Fuel, to secure a warehouse on Braddock Avenue.

“This is a very welcoming place for a business, because it has so few,” said Fossil Free’s co-owner, David Rosenstraus.

All this is movement in the right direction, but the uninhabited buildings are still falling down. Dozens are scheduled for demolition. “If struggling communities don’t preserve their architecture,” Mr. Fetterman said, “there’s no chance of any resurgence down the line.” Sometime soon, he worries, Braddock will pass the point of no return.

the roots of hatred that gave rise to centuries of pogroms and the eventually the holocaust seem to be finding new voice. Gradually I see people generalising Israeli actions to the actions of all Jews-- some kind of huge Jewish agenda they think. It also results in people inevitably minimising the Holocaust by drawing comparisons to that and what is occuring now in Gaza.
I agree what is happening in Gaza is inexcusably horrific, but the scale and horror of the holocaust was unprecedented-- and minimising it using this kinds of comparison is unnerving to me. only 60 yrs ago that the entire Jewish populations of europe were nearly killed (i know this is no justification for what Israel is doing-- I am not trying to argue that Israel is always correct because what happened 60 yrs ago-- but only that what is happening now in Israel is allowing certain hatred/guilt types of people to overlook what happened.
I am scared to think that if ""never again"" occurs again, it will be in some kind of response to Israel's existence-- I think this fear is also very prevalent in Israel....Israel is providing a manner for ancient/not so ancient hatreds to re-surface in a way people can rationalise.

These he translates - himself and with the help of a vast and highly trained staff - into many languages and circulates over the Internet. He also presents his findings to the US Congress and European parliaments.

It goes on...let's just say, she's a little Israel obsessed; that doesn't come across in Memri's about page.

So somebody with connections to Dick Cheney, a member of a Neo-con think tank, somebody with an Israel fascination and somebody who produced election material for America about the middle East. Last publication she is listed as publishing on the Hudson site...an article pro-McCain.  That smacks of the other allegation the Mayor of London's review picked up on...they've campaigned before and been found to be lying.  

But we have a site that claims to be impartial: one director was a Colonel in the IDF the other is in a neo-con think tank and her husband plays golf with Dick Cheney.

I've always held the position that its how a person treats everyone else that matters, not how they treat their fellow aristocrats.

Back in medieval Europe many knights made a big deal about their honor.  In battle if they disarmed another knight they'd let him retrieve his weapon because of that honor.  But, the same knight who would let a fellow knight rearm would not think of extending that courtesy to a landless footsoldier.  Honor, gentle behavior, etc was for fellow ""gentleman"", not for the hoi polloi.

The same can be said about most ""gentlemen"" throughout history.  Their courtly behavior, codes of honor, etc all applied only to other gentlemen.  Which brings us back to the topic at hand.

Most wealthy people in the CSA were ""gentlemen"", but that only affected their behavior for people in their social class.  The same southern gentleman who might express outrage if someone neglected to hold a door for a ""lady"" would see nothing wrong with casual cruelty, or mere indifference, to a woman of the lower classes, and certainly saw nothing wrong with slave women working in fields. They were outside his social strata, and thus his honor, his gentlemanly behavior, simply didn't apply to them.

Which is why I object to the use of the term as a superlative in the case of Lee, or most other people of his era.  If the term is to have any meaning at all it should be to describe someone who is honorable, gentle, etc to all individuals regardless of social class.",1233546260,2,2,t5_2cneq,sotonohito

... which is ... not America.  

The argument that certain Redditors have this hatred/obsession about Israel because they are American and therefore ""pay for it"" is complete bunk. _Most_ Americans don't hate or obsess about Israel with the particular fervor of a certain few Redditors here, although they too ""pay for it"". 

It's worth noting that Americans _do_ in fact ""pay for"" the Sri Lankan government's military campaign against the Tiger rebels: the US gives direct military aid to Sri Lanka, and has for years. .

I suspect that the entire tax contribution of all American redditors to the Israeli military machine is a grand sum of less than $1000 dollars a year, given that this site is mostly populated by students, jobless, juveniles, and freelance web coders. Sheeeyit, maybe if you wrote Israel a cross letter they'd send the cash back.

So: the real reason Most Redditors dont care about Sri Lanka, or DR Congo, or Southern Thailand? Because really they dont give a shit about anyone, Palestinians included, and their only interest in the Gaza conflict that it's a handy stick to beat Israel with.

If you wish to define me by that, be my guest, but I can think of a few different conclusions to come to.

&gt;What is clear is that you pretty good debater...

Thankyou.  I think.

&gt;...which always forgets to answer the tough points and tries to redirect his answers into ""friendly territory"".

Oh I do answer them...but even if I do not if I am debating you then you should fetch me up on that which you feel I do not address.

&gt;A word from a 73 old guy who may or may not have listen well to Mashal is not good enough to redress what the Hamas guys are saying all the time and which you conveniently forget in your answers. Again, here they are in Arabic:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEXQHqXmCRg

Well when I gave you Mashal saying he'd accept Israel under 1967 borders you asked for it in Arabic.  I delivered.  

When you raised the youtube vid I addressed it too.  It relates to a charter, in cut up and sliced up way...but it does.  Which is why I went out of my way to give you numerous sources which provided a granulated progression forward on the admittedly, in my opinion, backward charter on their conception.  That addresses the content of the Memri video.

But then, just as you dismissed The Guardian as a source, calling it 'moonbat, and asked for a corroborating JPost source (which I delivered) I also poo-poo'd Memri but I got nothing back :(

Here's why I poo-poo'd [Memri](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLFd4dlHPnc) again (and my video looks and sounds cooler than yours!!! :p)

**HERE WE GO!**
[Jpost](http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1162378407552&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull) :)

&gt;Carmon, 60, is clearly used to having to reiterate this seeming axiom. Since establishing MEMRI in 1998 to ""bridge the language gap between the Middle East and the West,"" Carmon and his material have been received with a combination of angst and ambivalence on the part of the press and politicians who don't like what they're seeing.

&gt;And what they're seeing is what Carmon refers to as the *""reality""* of the Arab-Muslim world.
How Carmon - **who served as a colonel in IDF Intelligence from 1968-88;** as acting head of the Civil Administration in Judea and Samaria and its **adviser on Arab affairs from 1977-82;** **as counterterrorism adviser to prime ministers Yitzhak Shamir and Yitzhak Rabin from 1988-93;** and as a delegate to Israeli peace negotiations with Syria in Madrid and Washington in 1991-92 - presents this ""reality"" is by monitoring Arabic publications, radio and TV broadcasts and religious sermons. These he translates - himself and with the help of a vast and highly trained staff - into many languages and circulates over the Internet. He also presents his findings to the US Congress and European parliaments. 


NO-NO-NO, there's a man that is COMPLETELY impartial...now go and find his military IDF record or that he has worked for two different Israeli governments on the Memri website.

They're not too open about that are they???

Impartial...just don't mention the fact that our founders are up to their necks in Israeli affiliation.

What else does he say when interviewed:

 &gt;What other projects are you engaged in?

&gt;The other projects we are working on are ""Arab Anti-Semitism"" and ""Jihad and Terrorism Studies."" A fourth, related, project is the ""Islamist Web Sites Monitor."" 

Well....that seems.....erm....balanced...er...perhaps the other founder will be better for you.

&gt;Wurmser wrote her **Ph.D. thesis on Revisionist Zionism behind the Herut and Likud parties**, and received her doctorate in political science at George Washington University....In 1996, Wurmser participated in **a study that led to the report, A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm, a paper prepared for Likud party leader** and then incoming Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, **that advocated pre-emptive strikes against Iran and Syria and the abandonment of traditional ""land for peace"" negotiations with the Palestinians.[3][4]** Other study participants included Richard Perle, David Wurmser, and Douglas Feith.

It goes on...let's just say, she's a little Israel obsessed; that doesn't come across in Memri's about page.

So somebody with connections to Dick Cheney, a member of a Neo-con think tank, somebody with an Israel fascination and somebody who produced election material for America about the middle East. Last publication she is listed as publishing on the Hudson site...an article pro-McCain.  That smacks of the other allegation the Mayor of London's review picked up on...they've campaigned before and been found to be lying.

by Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed - Monday, January 26, 2009

The arrival of the Obama administration will not fundamentally alter the course of military expansion accelerated during the Bush era. The origins of these policies do not lie uniquely in neoconservative ideology. While the election of President Obama may offer new opportunities for progressive forces to delimit the damage, their space for movement will ultimately be constrained by deep-seated structural pressures that will attempt to exploit Obama to rehabilitate American imperial hegemony, rather than transform it.

Indeed, the radicalization of Anglo-American political ideology represented by the rise of neoconservative principles and the militarization processes of the 'War on Terror', constituted a strategic response to global systemic crises supported by the American business classes. The same classes, recognizing the extent to which the Bush era has discredited this response, have rallied around Obama. Therefore, as global crises intensify, this militarization response is likely to undergo further radicalization, rather than a meaningful change in course. The key differences will be in language and method, not substance.

Obama and National Security: “It’s the Oil, Stupid!”

This became increasingly clear as Barack Obama’s administration appointees became known – individuals whose political and ideological positions are largely commensurate with neoconservative ideals particularly on security matters, and whose social and intellectual connections link them to neo-conservative think-tanks and policy-makers.

A glance through Obama’s national security team also raises eyebrows, but we should focus on his selection of former Marine General Jim Jones as his National Security Advisor. Jones was previously appointed to the NATO post of Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and Commander of the US European Command (COMUSEUCOM) under the Bush administration. The thrust of Jones’ imperial vision of US national security can be seen from a UPI article describing his work in 2005:

“NATO’s top military commander is seeking an important new security role for private industry and business leaders as part of a new security strategy that will focus on the economic vulnerabilities of the 26-country alliance. Two immediate and priority projects for NATO officials to develop with private industry are to secure the pipelines bringing Russian oil and gas to Europe… to secure ports and merchant shipping, the alliance Supreme Commander, Gen. James Jones of the USMarine Corps said Wednesday… A further area of NATO interest to secure energy supplies could be the Gulf of Guinea off the West African coast, Jones noted... Oil companies were already spending more than a billion dollars a year on security in the region, he noted, pointing to the need for NATO and business to confer on the common security concern.”

In summary, Jones’ national security strategy privileges US military control over regions containing substantial underexploited oil and natural gas reserves, in Africa’s Gulf of Guinea, the Black and Caspian Seas, and the Persian Gulf. This drive also allows the US to consolidate European dependence for its energy security on NATO, thus solidifying EU support of the wider US geostrategy to control global energy resources and transportation routes.

Obama and the Economy: Déjà vu?

As for Obama’s ambitions for tackling the financial crisis, even a scathing New York Times editorial noted that President Obama’s economic team, put together to tackle the economic and financial crisis, consisted of the very same people who had “played central roles in policies that helped provoke today’s financial crisis.” These include Tim Geithner who as president of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York “helped shape the Bush administration’s erratic and often inscrutable responses to the current financial meltdown, up to and including this past weekend’s multibillion-dollar bailout of Citigroup”; and former World Bank chief, Larry Summers, who “championed the law that deregulated derivatives, the financial instruments – aka toxic assets – that have spread the financial losses from reckless lending around the globe.”

Obama and the Transnational American Business Class

One needs to look beyond the rhetoric to get an idea of what Obama really means for the world. Analysis of Federal Election Commission data on the largest financial donors to both the McCain and Obama presidential campaigns reveals that they were almost entirely sponsored by the same banks, financial institutions and corporations (except Obama received significantly more corporate financing than his rival McCain). This suggests that US policies have, and will continue to, broadly represent the insecurities and interests of Anglo-American capital – and further, that American business classes actually favoured Obama and provided him the finances and expertise to produce a power-house media and publicity campaign.

Obama Shuts Down ‘War on Terror’… Not

So what should we make of Obama’s opening measures, almost as soon as he was inaugurated as President, to close Guantanamo Bay, de-legitimize torture and challenge CIA practices of extraordinary rendition? Firstly, we should of course welcome any such public condemnations of these practices, particularly by the new American President. But this should not blind us from critically examining what Obama’s Executive Orders actually meant.

While around the world, Obama’s measures were interpreted as completely reversing the Bush administration policies of torture, extraordinary rendition and secret prisons – starting with the declaration of the complete closure of Guantanamo Bay – deeper inspection of the details of his Executive Orders suggests, unfortunately, that cries of joy are slightly premature.

First, it should be understood that regardless of what elected US governments have said or left unsaid about the practice of torture by military intelligence services, torture is, and always has been, endemic and officially sanctioned at the highest levels. Declassified CIA training manuals from the 1960s, 70s, 80s, and 90s, prove that the CIA has consistently practiced torture long before the Bush administration attempted to legitimize the practice publicly. This means that what made the Bush era distinctive was not the systematic practice of torture by US military intelligence agencies, but rather the US government’s open and widely known endorsement of such practices, and insistence either on their obvious legality, or otherwise of the irrelevance of law in the context of fighting terrorism.

This means that Obama’s public disavowals of torture do not actually represent the end of the systemic practice of the CIA's traditional interrogation techniques, conducted without public scrutiny for decades. Rather, they portend a sheepish return to secrecy – or in other words, a return to the obvious recognition that open declarations of covert US practices such as torture as official policy are detrimental, not conducive, to US hegemony.

Closer scrutiny of President Obama’s first Executive Orders reveals that they were designed less to transform illegal US military intelligence practices, than to allow them to continue in secret without legal obstruction, by redefining their character (while retaining their substance):

1. While Obama demanded the harmonization of interrogations in line with a purportedly Geneva Conventions-compliant US Army Field Manual, unaddressed revisions to that manual in 2006 – “in particular, a ten-page appendix known as Appendix M” – “go beyond the Geneva-based restrictions of the original field manual.” Indeed, the Manual accepted 19 forms of interrogation and the practice of extraordinary rendition. Further, retired Admiral Dennis Blair, Obama’s director of national intelligence, told a Senate confirmation hearing that the Army Field Manual would itself be changed, potentially allowing new forms of harsh interrogation, but that such changes would remain classified.

2. Obama’s supposed banning of the CIA’s secret rendition programmes did not actually prevent the CIA from extra-judicially apprehending and detaining innocent civilians without evidence or due process, but

Not accepting Darwin's theory of evolution doesn't mean that you don't accept evolution- Darwin didn't know about genetics, only knew about a small section of the fossil record etc so the theory has vastly improved since his time. It's perfectly possible to believe in evolution but also think that Darwin's theory as it was is now obsolete.

Add to that the number of people who say they neither agree or disagree with it because they don't understand it - in my mind that's a LOT smarter than not understanding something and saying you accept it 100% because you want to sound smart. It's perfectly reasonable and rational to have doubts about something you only partially understand. It's not a rejection of the theory per se, it's just reserving judgement. 

The survey found less than a quarter believed in either intelligent design or young earth creationism (no telling how many of those believe in evolution but think God is responsible) and you can bet your bottom dollar that proportion would be much lower if it weren't for immigrant groups.

Islam *has* changed, and for much the same reason that modern Christianity has changed -- the circumstance in which believers find themselves have undergone significant upheaval.  Two major differences have likely determined the varying paths Christianity and Islam have followed.  One, no doubt, is the total difference in the belief systems they represent.  It would be easy to draw some conclusions about what those belief systems are, but I think it entirely likely that our historical vantage point is seriously skewed by our tendency to judge earlier Islam in light of our perceptions of modern day Islam.  In other words, how many of us can look at historical Islam and not see it as the soil from which al Qaeda and modern day Iran both grew?  Very few of us, I would think.

The other difference is that of how modernity has affected traditionally Islamic societies.  Starting at the latest with the Sykes-Picot plan -- but probably as early as Napolean's African campaign -- the Middle East has been consistently treated as a problem to be solved by European intrusion and intervention.  Modern Islam has been shaped, to some extent, by the reaction of its practicioners to the circumstance of European dominance.  Pro-Islamist have mythologized the medieval Middle East in part because it's the Islamic world least susceptible to Western influence, the Islamic world they can feel most confident recognizing as purely their own.

Well, the overt cause was religious affiliation, but at the time, the vatican could've actually helped rather than made the problem worse (lot's of books and documentation about some rather condemnable negligence)  The vatican had the means and resources to save millions of lives, whether by providing shelter in churches (a millenial tradition, just not afforded to Jews, whom the Vatican despises [read: expulsion of jews from europe]) or by publicly denouncing what the priests in Germany were telling the Vatican was happening in Germany. EDIT: See, for a time, the problem is that no one outside germany knew what was happening (this is why it was negligent of the vatican to ignore reports from priests inside Germany), so if they had won the war, the holocaust would have effectively 'never happened.'

Re. your unauthorised overdraft  

 

Dear Western banking establishment,  

 

I notice that your unauthorised credit facility from international lenders of last resort now totals approximately $10 trillion. As a taxpayer and therefore your largest shareholder I would be grateful if you could repay this facility at your earliest convenience. I have charged you an additional £30 for this letter and a monthly unauthorised overdraft fee of £28. If you do not repay this facility shortly I will have no choice but to become further massively impoverished along with legions of fellow taxpayers for multiple generations to come.  

 

I would also be grateful if the strategists and economists who work for you could abstain from publishing their unsolicited opinions about resolving the banking crisis within the financial media. I am sure you will agree that hearing from the same strategists who worked for the architects of such widespread financial destruction is likely to irritate those of us who were not actually complicit in the extraordinary and venal credit boom of the last several decades. There is an expression that if you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem. Those of your employees who were the public face of the problem are, I think you will agree, unlikely to represent the solution, unless perhaps they are fired – en masse, from a giant howitzer, into an area where they can do no further harm. Alaska, perhaps. I would further suggest that the high profile commentators who work for you and who have implicitly played their part in marketing and then amplifying this catastrophe might consider quietly entering another field with superior ethics and enhanced value to society at large: perhaps as piano players in brothels. This note has been copied to the letters editors of The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal (which I understand is shortly to be renamed simply The Journal on the basis that Wall Street no longer actually exists – as was noted this week by Messrs Wen Jiabao and Vladimir Putin at Davos. Don’t worry about not being there – you weren’t missed).  

 

Since the start of the year is always a time for slimming and working off the excesses of the festive period, I wonder whether your industry would consider operating along similar lines. Just as there is no real need to have 18 different coffee bars all touting their wares along my High Street, there is probably no real need to have 18 different banks, not all of which are subsidiaries of Santander, clogging the High Street and busily not wanting to extend me back any of my own money so generously lent to them.  

 

I would also be interested in your views as to the wisdom and efficacy of the monstrous pile of credit being shovelled at you and your peers by governments when it was overmuch credit creation that precipitated this crisis. I do not, of course, expect anything other than a self-interested response. But you may find the following observations pertinent. If they seem acutely relevant today it is because they were written in the early 1930s, by one Garet Garrett (and a grateful hat tip to M. Gandon):  

 

“The general shape of this universal delusion [that is, credit] may be indicated by three of its familiar features.. First, the idea that the panacea for debt is credit.. The burden of Europe’s private debt to this country now is greater than the burden of her war debt; and the war debt, with arrears of interest, is greater than it was the day the peace was signed.. Debt was the economic terror of the world when the war ended. How to pay it was the colossal problem. Yet you will hardly find a nation, state, city, town or region that has not multiplied its debt since the war. The aggregate of this increase is prodigious, and a very high proportion of it represents recourse to credit to avoid payment of debt.  

 

“Second, a social and political doctrine, now widely accepted, beginning with the premise that people are entitled to certain betterments of life. If they cannot immediately afford them.. nevertheless people are entitled to them, and credit must provide them.. Result: Probably one half of all government, national and civic, in the area of western civilization is either bankrupt or in acute distress from having over-borrowed according to this doctrine.. Now as credit fails and the standards of living tend to fall from the planes on which credit for a while sustained them, there is political dismay.. When [people] have been living on credit beyond their means the debt overtakes them. If they tax themselves to pay it, that means going back a little. If they repudiate their debt, that is the end of their credit. In this dilemma the ideal solution, so recommended even to the creditor, is more credit, more debt.  

 

“Third, the argument that prosperity is a product of credit, whereas from the beginning of economic thought it had been supposed that prosperity was from the increase and exchange of wealth, and credit was its product.”  

 

It will probably not have escaped your attention that the National Housing Federation this week urged the UK government and its wholly owned banking subsidiary, Northern Rock, to extend mortgages to people on lower incomes. “Given that Northern Rock has been nationalised it should now be made by ministers to take on a social purpose and ensure that those people on low-to-moderate incomes who can afford to buy a low cost home, and have a good credit rating, are given access to mortgages,” said NHF chief executive David Orr. Be careful what you wish for. The Nationwide building society, on the same day, reported UK house prices falling at an annualised 17%. Perhaps Mr. Orr wishes a whole new sub-class of low-to-moderate wage owners to be lured into a collapsing housing market. Nice one. Said wage owners should perhaps be grateful that the banking system is currently so dysfunctional (a.k.a. “finally prudent”) – it may end up saving them a fortune in lost housing equity.  

 

Perhaps you, like I, find it richly ironic that members of the public still use your investment subsidiaries as a means to protect and grow their private wealth. I think you should promote the activities of these subsidiaries more widely. My idea for an advertising slogan: “When it comes to moral hazard, we’re Number One. We helped trigger the biggest financial and economic collapse in history through our imprudent lending and investment. Between 18 million and 30 million jobs throughout the world are almost certain to be lost. And more than 50 million jobs throughout the world are now in jeopardy. As a result of our investment expertise, we’ve lost billions, and those of us that still exist and aren’t owned by the taxpayer are technically insolvent. Now, how can we help you with your finances ?”  

 

In any event, this letter is also to let you know that now that you and your members, in collusion with your governmental paymasters, are offering negative real returns to cash depositors, I am withdrawing what remains of my funds since I can find altogether better opportunities for the preservation and growth of my capital within high quality pockets of the equity and corporate bond markets, and I can get sufficient “insurance” for my increasingly worthless fiat currency in the form of gold. I appreciate that the withdrawal of my funds may send you spiralling into nationalisation. Sorry about that. And since you appear not to know the meaning of the word:  

 

“Sorry. (“sQrI), a. Pained at heart; distressed, sad; full of grief or sorrow. In later use freq. in weakened sense, and often employed in the phrase “I’m sorry” to express mere sympathy or apology. But not by members of the banking profession.”  

 

Yours sincerely

I'm not sure what your arguing about in the last two paras, since you've re-pasted the same section of my post, but I'll have a go:

I'm not interested in defending Hamas or Fatah, but what you tend to find is that extremists are only really sustainable when they are opposed, Israel provides this opposition, if Israel helped the Palestinians rather than killing and obstructing them, there would be almost no support for either party in the form they now exist. The approach that Israel has taken towards them has been extremely short sighted and, as we have seen, very destructive.

&gt;Israel has no leverage over any ME nation. It took the capture of the entire egyption army for egypt to ""normalize"" relations with israel. The only nations that have an effect on ME are those that buy their oil. But for us to embargo them, would be painful for the consumer.

This position is why the situation is so appalling. When Israel stops seeing the it as a conflict and starts looking at it as a shared problem to be solved nothing will improve. Israel will never win unless they kill every Arab (I am not making this statement as a threat as many Arabs do, but as a statement of observation of the history of occupations - occupying forces are always defeated given enough time).",1233606661,1,1,t5_2qh13,[deleted]

Zladko ""Zlad!"" Vladcik is a fictional character of the equally fictional nation of Molvanîa. Over time, he has become an Internet phenomenon.

Elektronik Supersonik

""Elektronik Supersonik"" is itself a kitschy, over-the-top combination of Italo disco and Synthpop. Zlad! is featured in a mullet, bushy mustache, and silver spacesuit and is supported by a female keytarist and background vocalist with pink hair. His lyrics are often in spoken word or badly sung, not to mention full of grammatical errors, reversed semantic units, and meta-references to thick Slavic accents. For example the song opens with: ""Hey baby, wake up from your asleep. We have arrived onto the future and the whole world is become elektronik, supersonik."" The end of the song contains a reference to the fictitios Eastern European country Molvania. It was featured in a recent ad campaign for Mountain Dew MDX. It also carries a heavy sexual undertone.

Second, those ads support a whole ton of jobs.

I agree to some extent, but I generally don't hear people use the term ""race"" to refer to the Sioux or the Croats, for example. They would be called a population or an ethnic group.

&gt;One person defines a Black as someone with dark skin, large lips and curly black hair, another person defines black as someone whose ancestors came from subsaharan africa. 

This is not the distinction in usage I was referring to. This is just ""ethnicity"" being used as a euphemism for ""race.""

&gt;But when it comes down to it, both definitions are almost as valid, and both will correlate well with genetic data.

They will only correlate with very specific genetic data, and even those specific data will generally only correlate well with smaller, more isolated and defined groups. There is far more variation within ""races"" (black, white, asian, etc.) than between them, and most of the inter-group variation is superficial (hair, skin color, eye color, etc) and all of these variations are fluid within the ""races"" themselves. Being able to say that people from one arbitrarily-delineated area (i.e. ""Asia"") are more likely to have a certain blood type than people from another (i.e. ""Europe"") may be useful for certain purposes, but I would not say that race correlates well with genetic data. Biologists tell us that race has no biological basis. It is socially defined.

You are either misinformed or deliberately trying to mislead. Your language was also toe curlingly offensive. It was Israel who broke the ceasefire on November 4th, under cover of the media saturation of the U.S. elections. They killed 6 Palestinians. This  has been widely reported, on CNN, C-span and U.K. news broadcasts. Mark Regev, the Israeli Govt. spokesperson stated on camera that their moves were strategic and pre-emptive. He also confirmed that during the ceasefire, no rockets were fired by Hamas and no Israelis were killed. Amongst the main ceasefire conditions that Israel had agreed to, was the gradual lifting  of the  iron grip blockade of Gaza on an agreed timetable over the ceasefire period; (provided Hamas did not launch rockets which they didn't) to allow emergency aid and  critical food, water and medical supplies to reach the civilians.Gaza is the most densely populated place on earth. It has been likened by countless knowledgeable sources; Jewish, Israeli and European to an open air prison. The residents cannot get out.  Fifty percent of the population is under 18 years of age. They live in conditions of near starvation caught up in the web of intrigue and political shenanigans of both Israel and Hamas. Whilst both sides have shown themselves to be deeply unscrupulous, it is far from a level playing field, militarily, financially and in terms of media skills. The Palestinians are paying the price for having democratically elected  a political organisation that Israel considers a sworn enemy. Israel adopts the policy that the new U.S. administration has vowed to forsake; that of pre-emptive action, which is also in violation of international law. This is a very complex region and the number of  parties involved with opaque agendas is mind boggling. To an extent, the Palestinians have become irrelevant in a battle for resources (land for selective settlement, water, natural gas and regional dominance. One day, Israel will have no choice but to get along with it's neighbours if it is to thrive. The notion that neighbouring Arab countries in the Middle East are hell bent on it's destruction does not hold up to close scrutiny, leaving aside headline seeking rhetoric on all sides. Even Hamas stated several years ago that it would come to peace with Israel under the U.N. resolutions for a return to the 1967 borders. Whether this is achievable or not is another matter. It does imply that there is a starting point for genuine negotiations. The whole world is affected by this conflict in some way or another. And so, it is up us as citizens of the world to become truly informed and to press for an equitable solution for all, that will stand the test of time.

You're misunderstanding I think. Allowing corporations to do whatever they want is the opposite of what a fascist government would do. Blackwater (as much as I dislike them) are and were no invasion force and don't have the manpower to do anything other than work as convoy security for a few people. Halliburton was given a ton of contracts but that doesn't mean that they are controlled by the government or control the government themselves, it just means they're being unfairly favored. Bush would have let those banks do what they did regardless of the campaign contributions given, it's just the kind of ideology he held.  

&gt;A private oligarchy ruled the White House, and they ran it in opposition to public interest the entire time.

Actually the president does and that's how it works in our system. They ran it contrary to popular interest because they're stubborn assholes. (no other excuse)

I expressed myself in too much of a hurry. I'm sorry for that and will try to elaborate.

""Fascism should more properly be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power."" A quote popularly attributed to Benito Mussolini. 

Fascism is capitalist nationalist tyranny. The opposite extreme of a socialist tyranny. One classic feature is that a fascist government has no clear economic plan, as opposed to rigid socialist planning. Laissez faire economics is the norm, which is certainly true with Bush. 

Don't attribute everything to mere coincidence about the Bush regime. Cheney favoring Halliburton, his ex-company, was no simple coincidence. Neither was the fact that Blackwater had MORE troops in Iraq than the US military (they needed to avoid a draft to keep support). And Bush? Well, he promised non-interventionist policies and fiscal restraint during the election. The complete opposite of what he then went and actually did. (And don't say ""9/11 changed everything"" cause the Iraq war was planned long before that). 

As far as I'm concerned Bush didn't hold any ideology other than lining the pockets of himself and his mates. So I agree with you they were stubborn assholes, but they committed treason against their nation and their people to obtain personal goals that's a pretty serious thing to do. Not something you should shrug off. 

&gt;The only reason they're demonized is because they demonize us and have contrary government types.

No, my friend. That's not the only reason. Most of them actually have a good reason to demonize you cause of your long history of violent interventions in their countries. I'm not saying you should kiss their asses cause quite a few of them are pretty nasty dictators, but your media seem to have little to no understanding of why they are right to be criticising you. There is no admittance of your own guilt or historical contributions to the current status quo. You like to take credit for good stuff to bask in your own glory (I've met Americans who believe they single handedly beat Hitler), but if it's anything bad it doesn't get mentioned. This is what's called ""propaganda"" in short, and Americans are huge victims of it and have been for generations.

&gt; You get a government that has a similar type as us and then tell us you aren't going to do something we're like we will be upset but we're not going to kill you.

Tell that to Saddam..

&gt; The GDP of the EU is as much as the United States, you're not weak, start standing up against unjust things instead of just talking about it.

We're not in the EU, and the reason for that, is that we are aware we won't have any say in the EU. We're too small to join a block democracy where we make up 1% of the total population. So ""we, the people"" in Norway voted against it twice. 

The EU forced us in anyway. They just called our membership something else, and our politicians had to go behind our back to finish the horse trade. That's how much power we have. We now pay heavy yearly dues to the EU and they control our export and import rates, but we lost the 1% voting influence we could have had (which would have made no difference to be honest.)

Here is a chart that shows how incredibly biased the data is if you are polling American versus  the rest of the Western world (except Turkey).  Adults were asked to respond to the statement: ""Human beings, as we know them, developed from earlier species of animals."" The percentage of respondents who believed this to be true is marked in blue.  Virtually every country other than the US (at the bottom of the list), more than 50% believe evolution true, plus another 10% - 20% of not sures, leaving small minorities of Creationists:

http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/bigphotos/21329204.html

For the purposes of this discussion, it's important to note that many of these countries are over 80% self-professed Christian, and also interesting to note that per this chart, contrary to other studies you mentioned, only perhaps 20% of those in the UK disagree with evolution.

The accompanying article is an excellent piece on how significantly the American sample differs from the rest of the world:

*Miller says the U.S. has a tradition of Protestant fundamentalism not found in Europe that takes the Bible literally and sees the Book of Genesis as an accurate account of the creation of human life.*

http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/08/060810-evolution.html

A key phrase here is ""Protestant fundamentalism"", which is an almost uniquely American frame of mind.

And then there's simple ignorance:

*But, the authors say, studies in the U.S. suggest substantial numbers of American adults are confused about some core ideas related to 20th- and 21st-century biology.*

*The researchers cite a 2005 study finding that 78 percent of adults agreed that plants and animals had evolved from other organisms. In the same study, 62 percent also believed that God created humans without any evolutionary development.*

*Fewer than half of American adults can provide a minimal definition of DNA, the authors add.*

In any case, with nearly a billion Christians around the world, most of whom are Catholic, the 'misundereducated' American Protestant 'young earth' fundamentalist is thankfully a minority.

I don't think that Laissez faire was the norm in fascist governments. The government and corporations were tied in such a way that they were indistinguishable. That's far from what it was like in the United States regardless of the favoritism and loose regulations that were in place.

I don't attribute it as coincidence in the least. I'm sure it was all intended. I didn't deny the favoritism of halliburton as you know. Blackwater does NOT have more troops than the US does in Iraq, not even close. They don't perform combat missions, they do nothing but escort and provide security for diplomats and the like. I hate Blackwater and other contractors of the same ilk, but I won't overstate their strength and goals either. Last I heard there were upwards of 60,000 contractors in Iraq, builders, mercenaries, and all. The United States has way more than 100,000 soldiers easy.

I'll never claim that 9/11 changed everything because it didn't (not on it's own).

&gt; I'm interested in how this happened (honestly). What did your politicians o to get you included in the EU without becoming a member?

This sounds insane I'm sure, but they kinda just slipped it all in through the back door. That has been the modus operandi for the EU all the time. The Brits only got to vote for a free trade agreement back in the time they joined. Now they are in a full blown economic union and none of them got to vote for any transgression the EU made since the simple free trade agreement.

In Norway, we just kept getting new rules thrown at us if we wanted to continue trade with the Union. And the last vote we had against joining (1994) only went through with a slight majority of the people (52.2% no), so actually the voice to join the EU has been quite strong in Norway and that made it easier for the politicians to implement the dictations from Brussels. 

Today however, a large majority (about 65%) say they are negative to joining the EU. 

We still have our own currency. We are not in a monetary union. And as mentioned earlier we do not have the vote. Apart from that, we are pretty much bound by Union policy.

&gt;I'm telling ALL the small kids in class to stand up for themselves, not necessarily against a ""bully"" but definitely against the ""popular"" guy.

There you have it. Strength in numbers. For us small countries there's no other options. And that's what the EU is about (it's one big ponzi scheme as well but I won't get into that discussion here :-)

But half the politicians in the EU didn't agree on anything that came from Washington during Bush. And the politicians who did agree with Bush had mixed support within their populations. 

It's important to remember that even if the EU is working its' ass off trying to become another US, it's not there yet. The various countries that make up the EU have histories (edit cause misleading: up to a couple of thousand years) older than the states in the US, and they didn't agree to form any kind of lasting bond until a couple of decades ago. It's a fragile structure and IMHO, it's not yet a completely solid balance to the US on the world stage.

I don't have hard facts, but based on what I do know and having my last name I can make a fairly accurate guess (I think). My family was from that area before 800 AD before the modern countries were there and my family was from the Götaland area.

Well if they can read a poll they should think again:

http://uk.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUKTRE5100W420090201

That poll was taken just last week. The explanation is simply the economic downturn; people think (probably correctly in my view) that without the EU we would be in the same position as Iceland now. 

The thing that annoyed me most about the Libson vote was that quite a few no voters gave a reason like 'don't want to be closer to Europe because its a big bureaucratic waste of money', when in fact the point of the treaty was to reduce red tape and waste.

Why do you think all the major parties are behind it? If there was even a half chance to give the government a run-in over something don't you think Fine Gael and Labour would try it? Instead they did the right thing and stood behind the treaty because they thought it was right. Also, if pressure from Sarkozy can make us do things, that already shows that we need Europe. If we didn't Cowen could just tell him where to go.

We drink. A lot. Start practicing now. You should be able to get through a dozen beers - and i mean real beer, not that horse piss they sell as beer over there - in an evening and still work in the morning.

You will get called a yank. We know that Yankee != American. WE DON'T CARE. 

Similarly, you'll probably get called a seppo. (seppo - septic tank - Yank. Also, full of shit.) Don't get offended. Laugh.

You'll get called all sorts of horrifyingly offensive things. Generally, the more offensive, the better we like you. If you get to the point where you're greeted with a drawn out WHAAAT'S UUUUUP CUUUUUUUNT you're an honorary brother.

Don't feel the need to defend the US. We're usually only ribbing you. And if you find someone who's serious, you're not going to convince them, so just let it go.

American football is a joke. Don't even go there.

Don't mention Steve Irwin. We only found out about him after he was dead. He's the Australian equivalent of a black and white minstrel show.

We drive on the left.

Try a kangaroo steak. They're better than you think.

Similarly, listen to some Australian music. There's some gems in there. Australian commercial radio is heinous but there are some great community radio stations in the capital cities - 4zzz in brisbane, RRR/PBS in melbourne, 2ser/SYN in Sydney.

Try and get inland, even if only for a couple of days. It's too easy to only ever see the East Coast, and there's a lot more to Australia than that.

Generally, if you prefer brash, upbeat cities, go Sydney. If you prefer arty, European cities, go Melbourne. If you like the heat, go Brisbane. If you want to go snorkelling, Cairns. 

Canberra is pretty boring, Adelaide is a quieter, boring Melbourne, Perth is really nice but the most isolated capital city on the planet. 

If you want to be heard, listen first. 

Go to tacky dives, but understand that there are always better places to drink. If the bar you're in is 80% tourists, you're hitting the wrong bars. 

Don't tip unless you really, really want to say thank you. Tipping drives down real wages and undermines the notion of the minimum wage. Also, kitchen staff get paid less and rarely get any of the tip. If you get a great meal, specifically TIP THE KITCHEN. If you love a restaurant and want to get treated like a god, tip the waitstaff and the kitchen. But really, this is not necessary.

Don't wear a flag. Really. Doesn't matter which flag, either.

Try watching Australian football - AFL, League, Union, whatever. Don't worry if it's not for you. Just give it a go. 

Don't climb Uluru. Go there, sure, but don't climb it. 

Wear sunscreen.

Doing some volunteer work is a great way to meet some great people.

Don't be afraid to ask for clarification on obscure slang. 

The age of consent is 16, the drinking age is 18. This is not a license to be creepy.

And if you do move, let us know! We'll take you out for a drink. Just don't poke the drop bears.

&gt; In fact, people do live in crowded conditions, and always have. We cluster together in cities and villages in order to exchange goods and services with one another. But while we crowd together for economic reasons in our great metropolitan areas, most of the world is empty, as we can see when we fly over it. It has been estimated by Paul Ehrlich and others that human beings actually occupy no more than 1 to 3 percent of the earth's land surface. 

&gt; If you allotted 1250 square feet to each person, all the people in the world would fit into the state of Texas. Try the math yourself: 7,438,152,268,800 square feet in Texas, divided by the world population of 5,860,000,000, equals 1269 square feet per person. The population density of this giant city would be about 21,000 somewhat more than San Francisco and less than the Bronx. 

&gt; Another fact: World population growth is rapidly declining. United Nations figures show that the 79 countries that comprise 40 percent of the world's population now have fertility rates too low to prevent population decline. The rate in Asia fell from 2.4 in 1965-70 to 1.5 in 1990-95. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the rate fell from 2.75 in 1960-65 to 1.70 in 1990-95. In Europe, the rate fell to 0.16 that is, effectively zero in 1990-95. And the annual rate of change in world population fell from 2 percent in 1965-70 to less than 1.5 percent in 1990-95. Worldwide, the number of children the typical woman had during her lifetime (total fertility) fell from 5 in 1950-55 to less than 3 in 1990-95. (The number necessary just to “replace” the current generation is 2.1.) In the more developed regions, total fertility fell from 2.77 to 1.68 over the same period. In the less developed regions it fell from more than 6 to 3.3. Total fertility in Mexico was 3.1 in 1990-95. In Spain it stood at 1.3, and in Italy, it was 1.2.

They learn this from very early on, while most Arab kids learn that the whole Israel is there's and they're gunna get it all somehow and push the Yedhud into the sea or ""back where they came from"".

Furthermore most Israelis are well aware of the State and individual soldiers' role in frightening off and even expelling Arab residents in these territories. Many are even familiar with the estimated figures.

How Israelis react to self righteous outsiders those pressing these issues is quite something else though.

No country's history in its most brightest moments of history is uplifted over Israel's current dark era.

Consider, when France snatched Alsace, it did so in the view that they ought to be compensated for a war they didn't start. Do citizens of all EU member states even know whose land their parliament is sitting on? Israel's ""annexation"" or whatever we can call it, wasn't as strait forward as France nipping a few 100 square miles off its neighbour, or [all these other cases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation#Examples_of_annexation_after_1948).

Regarding Gaza, Israel basically snatched it off Egypt who originally had every intention of keeping it for themselves, but they never wanted it back, preferring it to be a thorn in Israel's side, an official gov policy.

The West Bank likewise, Israel knew she couldn't have it, that annexations generally isn't acceptable, but withdrawing from there and leaving its residents to their war games wasn't something they wanted either.

The bottom line is the ""Palestinian Struggle"" for independence is analogous to someone who keeps brings a knife to a gun fight time and time again, the Pali code of violence is ancient, alike to how they treat each other, and no solutions are imminent until a younger generation of sane Arab leaders come to power in the territories.

Agreed - but it does not have the right to give away authority to which it has been empowered to carry out itself.

No more so than any other religion.  As more knowledgeable people can, and often do point out frequently on Reddit, Islam is (in its scriptures) a more socially progressive religion than Judaism and Christianity.

Of course, you seem to be pre-occupied by the way in which Islam is currently practiced in the majority of the Middle East.  That, of course, is a problem with modern practitioners of Islam in the Middle East, not the entire religion itself.  If you can't make that distinction, there is no point in continuing this discussion.

&gt;That's not semantics - you've argued that Muslims have created peaceful societies all over the world.

Civilized societies, not just peaceful ones.  If you want to find solid examples, you need not look further than the Middle East during the European dark ages and for quite some time before.  If you insist on the present day, you can look to Turkey (which is behaving as any nation would to secessionist threats), Central Asia (their governments tend to be repressive, but their societies are free from the barbarism present in the Middle East), and China (Xinjiang province).

&gt;It's a religion stuck in the stone age

Its the culture that is stuck in the stone age.  Yes, Islam is a central part of Middle Eastern culture, but their poor interpretation of the religion is what makes the region as ugly as it is.

There was an insurgency in Easter Ethiopia by Somalis who don't want to be part of Ethiopia. In a normal country the government would try to bring the civilians on their side to weaken the Insurgents. The Ethiopian Army surrounded villages in Eastern Ethiopia,raped,killed and razed villages. The food aid sent to the poor were diverted to the Army has a punishment to the civilians.

In 2006 Ethiopia armed and funded along with the CIA warlords in Somalia. The warlords were defeated. The government then sent the army to Somalia in the only city held by their stooges and then denied. They were given a warning by Somali Islamists to leave Somalia or face a war. They told the international community that the Islamists were Al-Qaeda. They ""offically invaded to defend"" themselves and the war lead to a 2 and half year Insurgency that lead to the deaths of 16,000 Somali civilians mostly at the hands of the Ethiopian army and their allied Somali militias.

They officially left (all though they still keep on entering)Somalia and the very same Islamists they accused of being Al-Qaeda is now the head of the government and is currently in Ethiopia in an African Union meeting.

They refuse to give Eritrea (a country ruled by an equally repressive regime who atleast don't pretend to be human rights loving democrats) back land that was officially given to it by the UN. The only reason according to John Bolton is because of Condeleeza Rice's protege Jendayi Frazer is Pro-Ethiopian.

True,,False,nyc,t3_7um37,,1425919942,0,t3_7um37,c07g6ho,0,,t1_c07g6ho,0,False,"Somehow, Joe Ades got people’s attention as the crowds swirled by at the Union Square Greenmarket, on their way to eyeing and buying the produce. He was the white-haired man with the British accent, the expensive European suits and shirts — the man selling the $5 peeler. For carrots. Or potatoes.

“He talked constantly,” said Clover Vail, an artist.

“He was very excited about carrots,” said Sara Mason, a merchandise assistant at Barnes &amp; Noble.

“He made it look really fun,” said Julie Worden, who dances with the Mark Morris Dance Company.

“The voice — you couldn’t help but notice it,” said Gordon Crandall, a mathematician who teaches at La Guardia Community College.

His was a particular kind of street theater in a city that delights in in-your-face characters who are, and are not, what they seem. For he was the sidewalk pitchman with the Upper East Side apartment. The sidewalk pitchman who was a regular at expensive East Side restaurants, where no one believed his answer to the “So what do you do?” question: “I sell potato peelers on the street.” Mr. Ades (pronounced AH-dess) died on Sunday at 75, said his daughter, Ruth Ades Laurent of Manhattan. She said he never talked about how many peelers he sold in a year, or how many carrots he had sliced up during demonstrations. She said he stashed his inventory in what had been the maid’s room of the apartment.

There were those at the Greenmarket who had heard the spiel, and heard the whispers. “Supposedly his wife is mega-mega-rich — we’ve done fashion shoots in that building,” said Rose-Marie Swift, a makeup artist, as she shopped at the Greenmarket on Monday.

The facts? He was a widower. The apartment had been his wife’s — his fourth wife’s. And besides Ms. Laurent, he is survived by two sons, Sam, of Sydney, Australia, and David, of Byron Bay, Australia; two brothers, Dennis, of Toronto, and Andre, of Sydney; a sister, Vida, of Toronto; and three granddaughters.

He had been selling things during his fourth marriage, and his third, his second and his first. David Hughes, the operations manager at the Greenmarket, said that Mr. Ades had been a fixture on the edges of the market for years. (He stayed on the fringes because he never obtained a permit to do business there, and if he staked out a spot too close to the vendors, someone would complain and security guards would be alerted.)

First he sold children’s books, Mr. Hughes said. “Then he moved into potato peelers,” he said. “He told me books were too heavy to carry around.” The Greenmarket was not his only open-air stage; he had places near Radio City Music Hall and in Brooklyn that he liked, Ms. Laurent said.

She said that he had learned the tricks of salesmanship as a teenager in Manchester, England. “He’d sold all kinds of things from when he was 15 and saw the old-time English grafters, I guess here you’d call them pitchmen,” Ms. Laurent said.

He sold linens, textiles, jewelry and toys, and broadened his inventory when he went to Australia in the 1970s. “We had a huge truck that we sold off the back of,” recalled Ms. Laurent, who worked with him, selling clock radios, cassette players and electrical appliances along with other household goods.

He followed Ms. Laurent to the United States. “One of his marriages, I guess his third marriage, had broken up,” she said. Making the rounds of state fairs, she said, “he discovered the peeler — someone was selling the peeler and he saw it as a fantastic item for the street.

“He loved the street more than anything.”

It helped that he had a voice like a radio announcer’s. “His voice really carried,” Mr. Hughes said. “Joe would say to me, ‘You have to not be afraid to talk to yourself out loud.’ He said that once he started talking out loud, somebody would stop, and once he had one, he’d have a crowd, and once he had a crowd, he’d sell peelers.”

Like an actor, he had a sense of pacing and timing. Ms. Laurent said that the peeler would slice “practically anything” but that he limited his repertory to carrots and potatoes when selling on the street.

Ms. Laurent said she sometimes went to look for him at the end of the day, but he would have packed up and left after selling out. She could tell where he had been.

“He cleaned up really well,” she said, “but still there were these little shreds of carrots that said, ‘I was here.’ ”",1233691921,2,2,t5_2qhu2,amph

The widget maker works for a large worldwide corporation that exports everywhere and he makes $5/hour. Next assume a tariff is imposed upon widgets and the corporation is put out of business due to trade wars. The widget worker then goes to work for a domestic widget company and makes $5/hour. I don't see how the US was negatively affected here, since he still has a $5/hour job, please point it out.

OK.

Currently there are more workers than there are jobs, hence the unemployment you are seeing, so lets keep that in mind.

Secondly lets say that the World wide widget company goes bust because of the tariffs on exports and everyone loses their jobs.  

Now, that company going bust also means its suppliers, from materials through to cleaners have to find someone else to supply, or downsize, so suddenly you have a whole supply chain that is losing jobs.  

The worker now starts looking for work, in a recession, oh and his spending power is reduced, as is the spending power of all his widget making co-workers,  that means that local companies supplying the domestic market where he lives now have a smaller income stream.  So he has to find a job in an economy where demand for widgets is down domestically and non-existent internationally (because of the export tariffs). 

So, if he is lucky he goes and gets a job working for a company that serves the (declining) domestic market, many of his co-workers won't be so lucky. The net effect is a loss of jobs, a loss of export revenue, more expensive products (where the domestic product replaces the imported one) and so less sales, damage to the retail sector (as people have less money and margins are lower) and quite possibly the total loss of some export markets and the companies that service them.

Its really quite simple.  If the US were able to compete on a cost basis with its international competitors in all areas it wouldn't have a trade deficit.  Given it can't hindering the exports it does have isn't going to help.  

Sure you will have people who used to have to compete with the international market doing better as they are the only game in town, but as they are not as efficient things will cost more.  Companies that were doing well and providing products for export will also be hit, they may not have a domestic market to fill or they may already be filling it, and so they will end up being less profitable and you see job losses.

&gt;This I agree with, in that the US will assume inefficient industries. For example, all those tech support jobs outsourced to india will have to come back to the US. US technicians will have a learning curve and will demand more pay than what the Indians would accept.

And the companies that provide the tech support will go out of business, or lose a large amount of business (so they will reduce staff) because their product will be massively more expensive and potentially lower quality (at least initially).

&gt;I see no harm to the overall economy. The same goods are available and only a slightly higher price is associated with these goods. However this is offset by the decrease in unemployment.

I doubt it, some goods will be much more expensive, exporters going out of business will mean more unemployment and a continued contraction of the economy.

&gt;Considering that many companies have relocated outside the US, whole industries would be instantly created under new management in the US. Textiles, clothing, furniture, electronics are just a few industries that have no domestic factories. All these companies would be brand new and under new management.

And where would the capital come from to build these? The banks, so I guess the ownership would be pretty much the same (assuming capital can be obtained at all).  Plus all these massive start up costs and capital expenditure would push up prices considerably (not slightly).

Moreover, with a marked decline in exports and imports and a contraction in the economy you would find that the dollar rapidly loses its value as a reserve currency.  Countries like China and Russia, plus blocs like the EU would suddenly find that it is preferable to trade for things like oil in other currencies (China especially if you cut off its supply of dollars from its exports).  So as the dollar loses its status as a reserve currency, it will also lose its value in exchange terms rapidly.  The next problem for the US would then be the ability to finance itself.  At present the US borrows and repays loans in dollars, it can print its way out of foreign debt, if a non exporting US suddenly finds that loans are available but must be paid back in Euro's then what?  It can no longer borrow, international investment backs off the currency declines further and the US economy tanks a little bit more.

&gt;Not sure what you're referring to? Assuming a 100% embargo on all imports, the US might not have enough workers to meet the demand produced by US consumers. A factory line worker would be in high demand simply to make widgets!

No, it wouldn't.  How could the US population pay for things when much of the things being produced are suddenly produced in an inefficient manner by someone making 10x the annual salary of the previous producer?  Prices would sky rocket, demand would vanish, unemployment would be rife.  If computers suddenly cost $2000 instead of $200 do you think people will still buy them in the same numbers as now? That applies to all areas of the economy!

In what European country has rioting actually led to economic stability? None, it just made a for a more hostile business environment prolonging the economic crisis.

Additionally, I think our lack of Riots had something to do with how decentralized cities in America are. In France, is there is a huge riot in Paris then their whole country pays attention. In united states, if there is a huge riot in New York, the rest of the country wont care cause its just stupid new yorkers. If there is a huge riot in Detroit, the rest of the country wont care cause its just the stupid from Detroit. If there is a huge riot in [any metropolitan city], the rest of the country wont care cause its just stupid [inhabitants of that city]. If its a rural riot, then its a local problem. If its a riot in DC, then its just a bunch of extremists showing off. Besides, the logistics greatly diminishing the scale of a potential riot.

Ive seen a riot in Europe before (huge anti-bush protest in ROME), and I can tell you that my feeling was that most people that were out weren't even politically inclined but were just out there cause it was something cool to do during an afternoon. It felt like a concert mostly. The few violent factions were denounced by the peaceful demonstrators.

Its almost daily that some 9/11 truther ex-paul tards calls for another riot on reddit. I know these people are extremists because no one will listen to their stupid political ideologies so they wish for riots for maximum publicity and exposure. However, it would be nice that instead of inciting pointless violence they would use that energy to educate themselves to why breaking shit will not really help the drastic rise in unemployment, unavailability of credit, or help soften the fallout from the burst of the housing bubble.

Coincidentally, you can be sure that these rioters have their money is gold cause every paultard/conspiracy site you go to has a least 10 'buy gold now' banners per page. These people pray for political instability of the united states government because that would potentially destabilize the dollar for that week and their gold investment would yield them higher returns.

As for why they should nationalise the banks. Well, I'm not sure that is the right the thing to do, but its seems its been impossible for banks to operate in the best interests of ""everyone's savings"" and our combined futures in mind.

Our money should be managed in our interests. I dont know anyone who has a pension from the last 10 years that even approaches the value of the contributions made to it.

Combine that with hybrid technology to gather energy which is otherwise expelled as heat via braking and you have the most efficient fuel burning car possible. 

The problem is that in the US a diesel engine now has an extra $1-2k price tag on it for new catalytic converter systems (NSR, for example is what Cummins uses) because of increased regulations on PM and NOx (EPA 2010). That, in turn, has caused diesel fuel prices to skyrocket because the catalysts are not immune to sulfur and therefore the oil industry has had to drop sulfur from 100ppm to 10ppm in the fuel. The problem is only going to get worse as we start to utilize crappier oil feed stocks which are more sour (sulfur laden) and contain more refractory sulfur compounds (which are the hardest to remove). 

Of course, sulfur is not an inherent problem in diesel fuels generated from biomass feedstocks. What Walmart is doing is 1st gen bidiesel. We need to get to 2nd gen which is conversion of celluosic feedstocks (waste biomass) into diesel. Not only that, but we need to figure out how to use existing capital equipment to do it because the capital expenditure for new equipment (such as with the fermentation route) is prohibitively high.

Nearly everything in the U.S. is already subsidized in some form.  Gas is subsidized which keeps the cost down compared to Europe.  Agriculture is subsidized to keep farmers growing.  Nearly everything is subsidized.  Your economy works entirely different than ours and can not be compared, it is just that simple.

The blockade will not be lifted until it is guaranteed that Hamas is unable to rearm. This is the lesson we've learned from the last time and if politicians have any brains, they will follow it to the letter. If there is no blockade, they *will* smuggle in weapons and send out suicide bombers. And don't give me the ceasefire excuses, Hamas dug a kidnapping tunnel.

Why does it matter at all? Why does it have to be fair, or proportional? 

&gt; Unfortunately you fail to see that the rest of the world has suddenly noticed the disparate position.

It's been quite obvious for decades. What they have noticed, however, is that Hamas is a terrorist organization with a long history - that's why no one wants to talk to them, and even arab countries distance themselves from them.

Let me give you some historical background on Japan.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_post-war_economic_miracle#.22Golden_Sixties.22_and_shift_to_export_trade

It's a well known fact that during the mid 50's to 60's in Japan, Japan expanded free trade policies, which increased the GDP of the country by over 10-fold within just 5 years.

In Japan didn't expand in trade, then why were almost all of the electronics in the U.S. and Europe during the 60's made in Japan?

I do agree that there needs to be a level of protectionism to ensure social stability in society; however, in concern with economic growth, protectionism only leads to lower productivity.

Protectionism and the Destruction of Prosperity

http://mises.org/rothbard/protectionism.asp

On a last note, how do you feel about U.S. farm subsidies? Where we pay farmers to kill their cows so that food prices would not be too low. How about corn ethanol subsidies? Where for every $1.25 we spend producing ethanol, we get $1 worth of product in return? That's protectionism. Are you seriously advocating that it is productive?

Why weren't the Soviet Union and Communist China filthy rich, instead nearly hundreds of millions of people unemployed with barely enough to eat everyday?

Again, we can go back to Modern China, where I'm much more knowledgeable of than the other countries. China was a shit hole prior to the economic reform (shift to export economy)in 1978.",1233709960,0,0,t5_2cneq,grapplerke

I agree that patent system doesn't spur innovation, drive up R&amp;D costs and all other things you mentioned. We don't have enforced software patents (thank god) in Europe and I don't think that it is a problem. 

The thing is, I believe that if inventor publishes his invention (good invention, not some junk) for all humanity to see, he should get something for it (definitely not 20 year monopoly, but maybe head start for his product or something). Do you agree?



One classic example that is showing benefit of patents in textbooks (Ok, not textbooks, but it was in three books I have read): drugs.

I will throw many numbers from my sleeve.

Big Pharma Company (BPC) is trying to find new drug. 9 out of 10 research projects fail on something (sorry, it just doesn't work | well, it causes liver failure in 80% of cases).

Yay, one of 10 projects succeeds. Patent it. Conduct tests on animals, people and all that stuff. 3 years gone.

Ask FDA for approval. another 3 years gone.

Now, I have ~ 14 years to sell my product to cover costs of all 10 research projects, all testing and make profit.

If BPC would't have patent, any other rival company could just buy new drug, analyze it for few millions and put it on market (no need for studies, everything was paid for by BPC) and BPC wouldn't invest into new drugs (it would be more profitable to put money into something else, like marketing).

This example is wrong? 

I am not in R&amp;D nor patent business, just regular programmer(I should probably use term soft. developer, because I have to maintain the code ^_^).

Edit: Everyone can easily see that something is terribly wrong with patent system, when all big corporation in a field have cross-licensing agreements with each other and have common policy for preventing important patents from falling into hands of patent trolls. They are  companies with most patents (and probably most innovative or at least with biggest R&amp;D budget), but have no money from patents (cross-licensing) and have to protect themselves from trolls. Yet they still fill patents and everything. ",1233710182,1,1,t5_2qh16,diffusion

= 1 seat per 26,500 Irish citizens.


**Now let's look at Europe:**

•Ireland has 13 MEPs = 1 European seat per 338,000 Irish citizens

•Low ball it, call it 500 million EU citizens with 736 EU seats = 680,000 voters per MEP

•Say Ireland needs to pass something with Europe, all 13 Irish MEPs = 1.7% of the vote


Europe is the equivalent of, in voters per elected official, saying that the Rpublic of Ireland only needs 7 politicians making all the decisions in its lower house instead of 166.  If that's not a step towards totalitarianism I don't know what is!!!

&gt; He continued to say that just because something is natural, like the marijuana plant, doesn't mean that it is good for you. 

This is true. Deadly nightshade is natural and..deadly. But Just because not everything natural is good for you doesn't mean pot isn't good for you. In this specific case, it's been used historically as a medicine and confirmed by science. Fear and Doubt, anyone?

&gt; But he said that it would be equally stupid to allow the American population to decide what should be used as medicine by voting to legalize marijuana for medical purposes. He said the population should leave it to scientists and doctors to determine the medical usefulness of marijuana.

This is extra sneaky. Yes, ideally this should be true. Except NIDA has a monopoly on supplying marijuana (unlike all the other scheduled drugs) and refuses to supply pot some studies even if they are FDA approved. The gov't is actively disrupting scientific research and so medical marijuana laws are the only alternative.

&gt; ""If the American people tomorrow voted to legalize marijuana,"" said Stutman, ""I would be okay with that. But it's not up to one group of people to decide.""

For the past 70 years one group HAS been deciding: fear mongering politicians (and more recently the DEA). Is he saying the american people are one group and it's not up to them? Well, he's morally wrong but surprisingly truthful for a drug warrior. Not helping his argument, though.

&gt; Stutman's main reason for opposing the legalization of marijuana is that it will cause an increase in the number of users. He said that it will lead to a higher number of car accidents because more people will choose to drive under the influence of marijuana.

It's plain to see that this greatly outweighs the tremendous damage done by prohibition: corruption, gang violence, private prisons, mandatory minimums, no-knock warrants, etc. Drugged driving and the harms of chronic toking (assuming there are any) are problems you could conceivably beat. But prohibition cannot succeed.

&gt;He cited studies from Europe which allege that marijuana can be physically addictive. He noted marijuana's adverse effects [...] keep them from achieving their full potential. 

This is a personal choice and the gov't has no right to decide for you. And it's totally inconsistent with everything else people engage in daily: driving, skiing, smoking tobacco, drinking booze, rock climbing, etc. In a free country a citizen makes an informed decision about the risks (we hope) and decides his action for himself. If his actions affect others, then he is punished.

&gt; This means that it can cause higher incidences of lung cancer than tobacco cigarettes.

Nations all over the world, in both eastern and western Europe, as  well as Japan, and others are experiencing population crashes right now, not booms.

In a few years, more than half of Japan's population will be over 50.  European nations are giving tax incentives and (sometimes) outright cash payouts at the hospital at the time of birth to women who will have more than 2 children.  Still, they see population declines.

Even in the USA, our population would be negative if not for immigration.

In nation after nation, it has been shown that if you give women access to safe and effective birth control, and give them the rights to actually use them, women do a fine job (in general) of managing their own ovaries.  Sometimes, some nations end up thinking they do too good of a job, since they need young workers to pay into the pension system set up for their older workers.

We do not have an overpopulation problem.  We do not have a birth control problem.  We have a women’s rights problem.

We see over population in nations where the only value a woman has is as a breeder.  In places where the only way a woman can have influence or power or worth is to have as many children as possible.

The Population Bomb, written in 1968, is about as relevant today as the original version of the Stepford Wives.  It says more about the culture and zeitgeist of the time than about any actual reality today.  It is something you would do an anthropological case study on, not something you would base policy on, or take as relevant today.  We still talk about this garbage because there are still a bunch of professors cloistered up in their ivory towers who remember reading this shit back in grad school, and it gives them a warm fuzzy feeling to publish just one more thesis about it.  They refuse to let it die, because these once-brilliant profs haven't got any new ideas, so they just recycle the old stuff one more time.  The problems arise when policy-makers read this crap and try to act on it.

This overpopulation BS is in the same category as Marxist Criticism and Gender Feminism:  Old-school academic-throwback subjects for all the white-haired PhDs who haven't seen fit to retire from their tenures yet.

Safe, effective, and accessible birth control has been proven to work in leveling populations in nations all over the world.  Show me a nation that is ""overpopulated"" and I'll show you a nation without women's rights.",1233740537,1,1,t5_6,Hyperion1144

* In a smaller country people think their participation in a protest will make a bigger difference.
* People are generally more inclined to protest/riot close to the seat of power. In most European cities the capital (seat of power) is also the biggest city, so a protests have a lot of people to draw on.
* Most people in Washington D.C. are working for the government (in one way or another), they're the less likely to protest.
* The U.S. generally has a more self-reliant attitude, the government has less of a visible presence in shaping economic policy, so government is less of an obvious target.
* Conditions in the U.S are not that bad, exactly as you say. France and Greece have high pockets of unemployment, they also have histories of protests and rioting, that's part of their national psyche.

Actually I don't think it has a lot to do number of police and jails/prisons (unless the police are visibly more intimidating, but that's only going to stem riots in the short term).

I also would disagree that protests accomplish nothing. Protests in a lot of Eastern European states (esp. former Yugoslavia), led to the downfall of governments.

Who is pretending they're not Christian? I think that was part of the Founders' writings- everyone was Christian, so they didn't think it necessary to write it in, based on the excesses of Europe.

I think the US should be the way it is- a nation based on Christian morals, but accepting to all types.

Someone I know is Russian, working just outside Moscow and flying often to western Europe. Her company tries to save money so she flies Aeroflot.

Anyway, about two years ago she was flying back from Germany to Moscow and a problem was announced as the plane was about to land (on final approach). They spent some time going in circles until it was announced that the undercarriage wouldn't go down.

So the plane went in circles to dump fuel and they executed a gear-up landing. It was textbook with a lot of bumps but nobody hurt.

Everyone was then collected by the military by bus and rushed away from the passenger terminal. They were then told not to talk to anyone and their luggage would be delivered separately and were taken directly home.

Although this was an international flight on a western plane (a Boeing 767), there was obviously a problem which was not logged anywhere and they were able to conceal it from the press.

The point is that neither Aeroflot nor the Government want it known that they have serious problems with fleet maintenance. It is clear that they are letting on crew who are incapable of flying too.

Israel is the regional power. It is the big mean dog, it has all that it wants, the land, military dominance over all its neighbours, trade, the coverage of the worlds only super power. Israel wants peace as it is comfortable. Israel wants to maintain the current status quo as is. Those who rule always do.

I dont expect anyone to agree with the Palestinian POV but at least to understand it.

Palestinians do not place the same premium on peace the Israelis do. They have very little. They have issues that need addressing, the right of return, the occupation of the West Bank, the annexation of Jerusalem, the economic shut down, the total control and blockade of their areas. They see peace as surrender. This is why they keep firing rockets. They want justice The ruled always do.

To get Peace the Israelis have to address issues they do not want to. Until Israel is prepared to do that, there will not be peace.

It can be done, The UK showed the way when it talked to the IRA with no pre-condtions. No, ""edit the United Ireland part of your charter"" before we talk. The commander of the Londonderry IRA is now a UK member of parliament and Northern Ireland is still a part of the UK.

The PLO was willing to change its charter and recognize Israel, didn't get them anywhere...

The solution to the problems obvious. All the peace plans are essentially the same. Clinton's Peace Plan, the Nusseiba-Ayalon Plan, the Saudi Peace Initiative, Bush’s Road Map, Oslo, Taba summit are all pretty similar

They all include clear measures that Israel has to take in order to make peace:

1.Dismantle the settlements, 2.Withdraw its soldiers and civilians from the occupied territories, 3.Create a viable Palestinian state, 4.find a solution for the Palestinian refugees' right of return. 5.Find a way to guarantee Israeli security. Altho' I believe having nuke addresses that. 6.A creative way to reward Israel for giving up what it feels it has won in war. $3B pa?

The problem is Israel refuses to go along with these plans. At some point, there will be an ""event"" and the talks will fail. developing new plans is a waste of time. Israel wants to keep the West Bank Israel has not dismantled a single settlement built there, and has never ceased to take Palestinian lands under the guise of security.

To end here a great quote from 1938. George Antonius

""The treatment meted out to Jews in Germany and other European countries is a disgrace to its authors and to modern civilisation that posterity will not exonerate in any country that fails to bear its proper share of the sacrifices needed to alleviate Jewish suffering and distress. To place the brunt of the burden upon Arab Palestineis a miserable evasion of the duty that lies upon the whole of the civilised world. It is also morally outrageous. No code of morals could justify the persecution of one people in an attempt to relieve the persecution of another. The cure for the eviction of Jews from Germany is not to be sought in the eviction of the Arabs from their homeland and the relief of Jewish distress must not be accomplished at the cost of inflicting a corresponding distress upon an innocent and peaceful population"".",1233745753,9,9,t5_2qh13,Lard_Baron

&gt; Collective punishment is totally illegal. As illegal as - say - organising suicide bombing

The difference, of course, is that a suicide bombing is initiation of aggression, and blockade a passive response. Since international law does nothing to defend Israeli citizens and ensure their safety and peace, its position on legality of our defense strategies is immaterial.

&gt; The principle of proportionality is well established under international law.

There is no alternative.

The assault on Hamas, which you keep calling Gaza attack as if Gaza itself was the target, is a minor and unimportant episode. Compared to other wars, the bodycount is low and the execution is extremely efficient. No matter how much the left tries to paint this as an attack on civilians, it never was one, and evidence of that- with arab fabrications - will keep emerging for a long time. Cast Lead was fumed over and rooted against by the european pacifist left, but that's because of their intense dislike of nation states and jews.

A transcript of a show on PBS.  DNA testing has been done on Israelis claiming to be Cohanim and another tribe in southern Africa claiming to be Cohanim.  Here's part of what was said:

&gt; The results are stunning. A group of genetic markers - a distinctive combination of letter changes and repeats, dubbed the Cohen Modal Haplotype - is seen in about 10% of the general Jewish population and in over 50% of the Cohanim. The long-held Jewish belief that priestly status is passed from father to son over the centuries seems to be confirmed in the genes.

So DNA testing has shown that Jewish ancestory is at least centuries old, despite the mainstream notion that you claim of the 40s and 50s.

Furthermore, Jewish proselytization is unheard of.  Catholics and Jehovah's Witness are well-known for trying to convert, but there are no well-known Jewish groups trying to convert people.

http://www.khazaria.com/genetics/abstracts-nonjews.html

There's more DNA research in the above, too, that claims that Jews are related, despite your claims of all the converts.  The DNA also proves that even the Jews of Europe have Middle Eastern ancestory.  Personally, I don't think it matters who lived where generations ago.

B. ""Israeli public is not mature enough""?  The condescending banter an elitist offers when not enough people agree with him.

*However, 11.5% of male Ashkenazim were found to belong to R-M17, the dominant Y chromosome haplogroup in Eastern Europeans, suggesting possible gene flow. The authors hypothesized that ""R-M17 chromosomes in Ashkenazim may represent vestiges of the mysterious Khazars"". They concluded ""However, if the R-M17 chromosomes in Ashkenazi Jews do indeed represent the vestiges of the mysterious Khazars then, according to our data, this contribution was limited to either a single founder or a few closely related men, and does not exceed ~ 12% of the present-day Ashkenazim.*

In other words, about 11-12% (or 1 out of 8) Ashkenazi Jews do show European lineage. Also remember that this is based on a marker on the Y-chromosome, meaning it refers to males only. Migrating populations usually consist of more males than females, and they often find local women to marry. Wiki also says that matrilineal markers tracing back to an origin in the middle east can only be found in 40% of Ashkenazi women, meaning a considerably larger proportion of Ashkenazi Jewish women have non-middle-eastern ancestory.

Which goes to show that captainhaddock wasn't wrong at all, there is indeed an admixture of European genes in Ashkenazi Jews. This should come as no surprise, even to people who know nothing about genetics. Ashkenazi Jews look much more caucasoid than other Jewish populations who don't have the Ashkenazi heritage.

The only question really is which Europeans did they mix with, and how much. The Khazars are certainly a possibility, though it doesn't rule out other sources as well. All these studies are based on a very small set of genetic markers. As more and better markers are utilized and as genetic information about a wider demographic becomes available, these questions will be answered.",1233753511,4,4,t5_2qh13,DaveM191

Hitler and WW2 had nothing to do with Zionists' intentions to take over Palestine. But the holocaust certainly did help by shifting the world's public opinion in favour of Zionism.

The other issue is that many of the current Israelis aren't even Jewish. Israel tries to attract as many Jews as possible by giving them free homes and farmland (mainly stolen from the Palestinians in the occupied West Bank).

I think the case in Europe is far more complicated than has been recognized in atheist media outlets.  It's been linked to education mostly by focussing on one or two national examples rather than looking for common factors among all nations with rising atheist rates.

Robert Kagan offers one explanation for how they were able to restructure their societies so radically and to so much benefit, but unfortunately its an explanation we can't benefit from in the same way.  Essentially, European nations were able to cut back drastically on military spending after WWII because the U.S. provided an umbrella of Protectionism against the Cold War threat of Russia.  Most European nations have little or no military that they can mobilize outside of their own borders, save as a compliment to a U.N. or U.S. military force.  That allowed them to rededicate much of their wealth (as they built it back) to improvements in other fields, including partial socialization.

Iit may be that part of what encouraged the growth of atheism in Europe was simply that rapid restructuralization, not to mention perceptions of their relative place in the world.  In other words, it isn't the shape those nations took so much as they fact that they changed shape.

Those small countries whose sole means of production are from agriculture are left with nothing. So when Brazil embraces protectionism when it comes to agriculture, especially sugar cane crops, I fully support it because it's a fair retaliation to the tyranny of the United States.

My whole principle of the argument is that if people around the world all embraced free trade, then everyone would be more productive, goods and services would be cheaper and more efficient. It may seem ideal, but it is very valid. I'm looking at the economy on a macroeconomic global scale.

From Forbes.com:
 
(1744-1812) Meyer Amschel Rothschild:
Meyer Amschel Rothschild helped invent modern banking by introducing concepts such as diversification, rapid communication, confidentiality and high volume. The superlatively discreet foreign-exchange banker diversified from the very beginning, selling antiques and procuring loans. Remarkably, Rothschild was willing to cut into his own profits in order to secure future business.
And, earlier than most, he understood that time and information meant money, and he pulled out all the stops to remain in constant contact with associates across Europe. That network came in handy when he helped finance England's war effort during the Napoleonic Wars. Rothschild institutionalized his bank with a far-sighted will that ensured the continuation of his business. Considered a founding father of international finance, his banking empire--thanks to his five sons--had expanded to London, Paris, Vienna and Naples at the time of his death.

Yes, I can.  The Soviet model for socialism was unsustainable, and always was.  Once we finished with Germany, we immediately settled on the Soviets as the new enemy, and vice versa.  We didn't necessarily *have* to do that, but we chose to be provoked into it.  It created an era of cold hostility where Eisenhower's military industrial complex was given fertile ground to become the leviathan we have now.  Europe joined NATO in solidarity against the Soviets, but left the bulk of the issue to the US while they focused on internal reform.  We also instituted many reforms, but not to the extent that the Europeans did.

Europeans have been far more relaxed about religion than Americans for a long time.  The more relaxed about it Europeans become, the more obsessed Americans seem to get.  We added ""In God We Trust"" to our money and added ""under God"" to our pledge of allegiance.  Our cultures have diverged wildly, and I can't imagine that education hasn't been one of the driving forces behind that change, particularly as our education rankings decline as our religious sentiments rise.

We've been a nation of anti-intellectuals for some time, and our religious leaders have been at the forefront of this movement.  Why?  What about intellectualism threatens them?

Sorry, I didn't mean ""in Israel we get called European invaders"", but more ""we get called European invaders of Israel"".  I should have been clearer.

And as to who calls us that, the Arabs and their supporters do.  You can read it on this site sometimes when one of the resident anti-Zionists or anti-Semites decides to argue (as though they have to anymore) that the Arabs are the legitimate inheritors of the heritage and birthrights of the ancient Israelites, and therefore the proper owners of the Land of Israel.  They say that we are all European converts, and that we therefore have no right to the home we longed and prayed for over almost two millenia.  This is *extremely* insulting to us, by the way.

&gt;As well... from your perspective and experience, how many Ashkenazim in Israel actually believe they are descended from the ancient Israelites, as opposed to considering that idea, true or not, an expedient card to be played?

Nearly all of them believe it.  Born Jews worldwide know we are descended from ancient Israelites, and the genetic studies have been done that back it up.  Yes, other gene lines have been introduced (meaning that some people converted to Judaism along the line somewhere), but those converts never married solely among themselves.  The converts or their children always ended up marrying a ""genetic Jew"", and thus our gene pool is a mix of converts and ancient Israelite.  We really are descended from ancient Israelites, and just looking at a random Jewish family will often confirm this: within a family at least one person usually looks very obviously Mediterranean.  And that's among Ashkenazim, who have relatively more European convert genetic material mixed in than other Jewish groups.

As I've noted before, the studies also found that our closest genetic relatives are the Palestinian Arabs.  We and they share common ancestry, but they were Christianized, Muslimized, and Arabized over the centuries.  They now call themselves Arabs and speak Arabic as their birth tongue.  If you called them Jews they would take offense, except if you said it in such a way as to imply that the land is theirs because of it.  For example, if you told a Palestinian Arab that he could get the house he's a ""refugee"" from back by converting to Judaism, learning to speak Hebrew, and becoming Israeli on the basis of his descent from ancient Israelites, I bet he would spit on you.  But the same man would claim that his people own *all* of the land west of the Jordan River.

They play the ""we're Israelites"" card with naught but a genetic right, whereas our right is both genetic *and* cultural.  And multiple times we have made proposals to share the land, but it seems if the Arabs can't have it all then they want war.

*In* Israel this sort of thing doesn't matter.  There *is* (non-endemic) racism between Jews unfortunately, but nobody considered sane goes around calling anyone ""not real Jews"".

What would make you think I would disagree with that?

&gt;You are quite emotionally invested in this subject, aren't you? 

I don't have stronger language.  If you guys don't understand what life and death and ruining the entire fucking planet means, I don't know how otherwise to express the extreme gravity of the subject.  There is NOTHING in the universe more dangerous to humanity than these people that flippantly throw aside anything just cause it doesn't ""feel right.""

You would be dead if they had their way.  You would not have penicillin to cure an illness and would have almost certainly died.  Does that sink home?  If Pasteur were proposing his vaccine today, he would have no chance whatsoever.  He would be insulted and thrown out of whereever he managed to land a job for being a moron to suggest putting disease-causing organisms INTO people, even if they were dead.  Everyone you know, would likely have died in infancy.  Everyone.  Unless you know a TREMENDOUS amount of people, then there may have been 1 that would survive.

How many people died AFTER the germ theory of disease was suggested and rejected?  All of those people are who I'm thinking of when people defend the unthinking simpletons that think how something ""feels"" is more reliable than a statistically valid, scientifically rigorous repeatable peer-reviewed study.

&gt;You seem to feel that folks should believe in all the assertions of scientists as if they were gospel truth.

What the fuck are you smoking?  Are you just ignoring the fact that I have clearly said at every single opportunity that you have to EVALUATE THE SCIENCE BASED ON OBJECTIVITY?  Read the last 3 sentences of the comment you replied to.  Then read them again and again until it seems to you ABSURD to ask me if I think people should accept scientists at their word, because it is the impression you should have gotten the first time you read it.

&gt;Folks in Canada or New Zealand or Britain know how to think critically about scientists' research and their conclusions.

Oh yeah?  Ask someone from Britain what they think about genetically modified food.  That's a fun show, the simpletons go yapping about ""frankenfood"" and start wetting themselves.  You point out that genetically modified rice has saved more people than have ever lived on the planet before it was created and what do they do?  Critically understand that they're being utterly stupid and opposing life-saving technology on the basis of something they half-heard on some talk show?  No, they yell ""Frankenfood"" louder and maybe shove you, that's their version of reason.

There isn't any country in the world right now that isn't wrapped tightly in anti-intellectualism, anti-science, and everything that goes along with it.  Show me a country willing to put ""No law shall be passed that restricts the freedom of a man without scientific proof of harm"" and we'll check the place out together.  Until then, ignore the talk shows and blog posts you've seen babbling ona bout how great Europe is.  They're more obese than Americans (in Britain), they're accepting of ridiculous violations of their freedoms for absurdly childish reasons, etc.  There are scientists everywhere, and there are idiots everywhere.  The scientists mostly try to hide because there are millions more idiots.  And no, it has most decidedly NOT always been this way.  That's the argument I usually get, and it is pure bullshit.  Bit of evidence for why I believe that... before the Revolutionary War, more copies of ""Common Sense"" sold in America than there were homes.  Can you comprehend that?  More than 1 copy per house of a book on the philosophical foundation of just government?  How can anyone say that at that time the average person was not a GENIUS compared to the imbeciles wandering around today, protected by science and technology at every turn, spurning it at the others?

&gt;If you want to help someone otakucode, you have to understand the situation they are in.

Well, I try.  I really do find it hard to relate to people who think ""it seems barbaric"" as reason enough to pass up a potentially life-saving treatment for their children.  Or people who hear ""vaccines got merc'ry in um"" and put their children in mortal danger (never bothering to learn you get 300x more mercury every day in your daily food.  THOUSANDS times more if you eat a can of tuna).  The only way we CAN help those people is to beat them over the head with it, make it socially unacceptable to be an asshole idiot, get met at every single instance with disdain and insults, etc.  It's how they got the way they are in the first place.

&gt;You don't act rashly, otakucode when someone is in trouble. Why? Because you can end up making their problem a whole lot worse - and you can even make problems for yourself.

Right... you ignore your natural inclinations, your natural intuition, and your natural ideas.  You reject them because it has been shown to you that there is an objectively benificial reason.  You could consult studies if you felt the need.  

Do you not realize that the majority of people in this world today would have told that lifeguard teacher to shove it, that all animals swim so they should know how to do it naturally?  If the coach told them to reject their feelings and calm down when someone was in trouble, they would say that doesn't asound right, that sounds like making yourself a robot.  They don't believe in that, so they're not going to listen.  They bumble around, hurting people everywhere they go, with everything they do, and they don't give a shit.  They don't have to because the few scientists and rational thinkers around have managed to put together a rickety framework that keeps them mostly safe no matter how stupid they are.

I agree that it *shouldn't* have, but it has, since Israel defines itself as jewish. The genetic research results hint that Palestinians and jews are probably the same people from the beginning, so one basis for the Israeli nationhood is compromised.

There's also the thing that different jewish groups, like Russian vs European vs ""indigenous"" (ie, the jews that stayed in the ME) have significant genetic differences between each other. The indigenous jewish people, eg, are genetically closer to Palestinians than they are to Russian jews. That's understandable, since the Russian jews never emigrated from the Israel/Palestine region in the first place, but were mostly people in Russia that converted at some point.

Today, the large majority of Israelis are descendants of European or Russians jews. They just flooded the country and overwhelmed indigenous jewish and Arab Palestinians, that had managed to live in relative peace up until then. To me it looks like a lot of the problems have to do with the fact that you had complete foreigners with colonialist mindsets brought from Europe into the place.

What's more, these same countries tend to also have laws that include corporal and capital punishments like flogging, amputation and stoning.

Eastern Europe in particular was the site of a great deal of contention, for obvious reasons, but Western Europe was able to retreat from defense spending to the extent that, as their financial status grew back to its pre-war rate, those nations were able to institute broad social reforms.  The U.S., on the other hand, was committed to Protectionism and a much higher grade of military spending, which limited the amount that could be spent of social reform.

Slavery is wrong and a horrible institution, don't get me wrong, but it's simply not true that it formed the basis for the growth of the Roman and British empires and the United States.

Slavery was widespread across the ancient world, but it was Rome that conquered and won. Obviously other, more important factors explain Rome's success. The French bought and sold slaves, and so did almost all other European powers, but it was Britain that ruled supreme.  Obviously the slave trade was not the reason for Britain's dominance.

With regard to the U.S., suffice it to say that the country thrived and became a world superpower AFTER slavery was abolished. Obviously slavery was not a key pillar in wealth creation here.

The US felt that communism was a disease, and pledged to destroy it before it could spread.

From a pure theory standpoint, the first Marxist Communists believed that communism was an inevitable stage in human development.  You could divide that advance guard of Communism into two basic camps: those who wanted to push history along in the interests of reaching equality, ie. the active; and those who wanted to help cushion the blow of successive revolutions so that the upheaval wouldn't hurt individuals, ie. the passive.  European socialism and communism were much more theory-bound than Russian communism, though, and Soviet policy was almost never in line with Marxist doctrine.  So while from a purely theoretical point of view it would make sense to expect the Soviet Union to rely as much on the inexorable march of history as they would on policy, the historical fact of the matter is that they were as aggressively expansionist as circumstance would allow, and sometime moreso than prudence would dictate.  In part, reaction to the Soviet example is what pushed Europe, and especially Western Europe, towards a softer socialism -- that is, socialism which functioned as a party in a multiparty democratic framework, rather than as the centralized base of government.

Your assessment of the U.S. policy with regards to the Soviets is more or less correct, although I would add that such policies were founded upon, or at least popularized by, a generalized viewpoint that confused Marxist Communism with the Leninist-Stalinist varieties.  At a certain point, it became unclear what we were fighting against, and remains so.  Which isn't to praise Marxist communism, but recognizing the difference at least allows us some framework for recognizing that there's no necessary reason to regard something like France's socialist political parties in the same light that we would Soviet Russia.

But recognizing that Soviet Russia was, despite the theory it presumed to embody, aggressively expansionist, at least makes some sense of the concerns that gave rise to the Cold War.  And Europe had been, at the time, all be incapacitated by WWII -- which was, it would seem, Stalin's intention in making peace with the Nazis early and long enough that they could arm for widespread war.  So I can't agree with you on the count that ""Protectionism would be unnecessary"".  Some sort of containment probably was necessary, and the doctrine of Protectionism was a necessary correlary to the course we took.  Some other course may have been possible, but offhand I'm not able to see it.

&gt; Because I believe that intellectualism and atheism are both a consequence of a proper education in critical thinking. I believe critical thinkers are less likely to be religious and more likely to be intellectual. I think education systems of successful European countries are a model for this.

Those are all a priori arguments that you're bringing to the question, though.  A nation's attitude towards ""intellectualism"" could just as easily be a consequence of the same factors I've mentioned as potential causes of a rise in atheism.  That is, atheism and intellectualism could be, in certain circumstances, twin effects of a more historically rooted case, rather than atheism being the effect of increased intellectualism.  Nations that have all but abandoned militarism, for example, may be more inclined to invest, not only financially but also in terms of zeitgeist, in intellectualism.  They may start to base some of their national identity on it.  Ergo, given two of the most atheist nations in the world, Japan and Sweden, the first was forcibly disarmed and has only recently begun to conside rearming, while the other has benefited under the umbrella of American protectionism since WWII and supports a standing military primarily for defense and in support of U.N. peacekeeping nations.

The correllary to that argument would be that heavily militarized nations have lest to invest in building a national identity around intellectualism.  In fact, too much comfort with intellectualism could impair a nation's investment in militarism.  There's likely no better example of this than the U.S. -- military spending makes up about half of our discretionary spending.  Anecdotally, it seems to me that American suspicion of intellectualism is never higher than during rallies to support a push to war -- compare our relative comfort with Obama's intellectualism to the defense of Bush *against* intellectualist arguments in 2001 and 2004.  Any resort to intellectualism during the march to war is likely to blunt our effectiveness in fighting a war, so a more militarized nation can be expected to resist intellectualism, and rarely moreso than when they're actually engaged in war.

Given the logic of all that, I'd say intellectualism is a less a matter of the educational system than vice versa.  A country that has some part of its national identity invested in intellectualism will produce a certain kind of educational system.  And in the case of countries like Japan and Sweden, an argument could be made to the effect that their relatively high educational standards and rates of atheism are coincidental relative to one another, but that the educational standards rose as the result of the reinvestment of capital and interest from militarism to intellectualism and that atheism rose as the result of social upheaval, with both the reinvestment and the social upheaval occurring as consequences of the results of WWII.",1233851031,1,1,t5_2qh2p,blackstar9000

It was interesting that everyone where I worked looked at protests as an excuse to get off work - if you asked anyone why they were there protesting, half of them couldn't even come up with an answer.

The worker strikes are different though, the people striking know what they want, and it is always more money.  The strikes can bring paris to a grinding halt and everyone knows it, so they usually get concessions.  The problem is, that if a average sized economy keeps making concessions to the workers, it ends up driving down the standard of living for everyone.  You see it in france right now - their latest attempt to provide jobs to french workers was by lowering the hours in a work week.  The idea being that now businesses will be forced to hire 3 people when 2 used to be enough.  In the process it ends up lowering the hours of the other workers and decreasing their take home pay.

I never intended to kick ass. I just have opinions about things and I try to support them logically; I don't always succeed.

And you may be right that their tax-exempt status won't be re-evaluated, although at this point I don't claim to know what will happen either way. That's for the courts and the IRS to decide.

However, I believe that while to some extent these laws do exist to prevent political organizations from becoming religious organizations, by the same right I think they also exist to prevent religious organizations from becoming political organizations, especially considering that the Constitution and Bill of Rights were undoubtedly created by a group of people who remembered all too well how the church was a dominant force in European politics throughout history.

This, I think, was a part of the reason behind the first amendment, which protects religion from persecution, but also separates the church and state. The church and state must remain separate to protect the state from the church, and also to protect the church from the state - if politics become too entwined with religion, then followers of that religion become susceptible to persecution from both opposing political forces and others within their religion - as is undoubtedly felt by many Mormons who believe that their religion's official stance on gay marriage is wrong.

Likewise, intertwining church and state infects the public affairs of politics with the personal beliefs of religion, resulting in injustice fueled by these religious beliefs. It's one thing for a religion to espouse the belief that, say, women have a different role in society than men. But when that belief becomes a law, it becomes oppressive even to those who do not share this belief.

And while you can argue that no one really thinks that the Mormon church is a political organization, the question then becomes, ""when do you?"". At some point a line must be drawn to determine what is acceptable and what is not. As it happens, that line already is drawn, and it is drawn in part in our tax laws, by the IRS.",1233867411,1,1,t5_2cneq,CaspianX2

First off, I never said that the economic crisis in Iceland has ANYTHING to  do with the social programs they and other Scandinavian countries have.  What I said was, that:

&gt;I think we are going to see just how **sustainable** these model countries of european socialism really are.

Given the current economic problems facing the country brought on by the fall in the banking sector, coupled with the countries GDP and financial obligations, I don't see how sustainable their social programs  will be.  There simply is not enough money, and the only way to pay for them is by taxing citizens.

To clarify, I am just as concerned with the social programs in the US - Social Security/Medicare among them.  How do we continue to pay for it along with high defense spending with such huge deficits?  Sooner or later, our credit rating and currency will be just as worthless as Icelands, however, I think the problem is compounded and made much, much worse when you already have such high tax rates and extensive social programs as seen in much of Europe.


Second, I never said that the people striking were doing it for fun, I was referring to the numerous protests in france.  The strikes are different than the general protests and are efficient at getting the government to provide concessions and which is why the people do it.  However, many of the concessions granted are at the expense of the other citizens.  (taxes, shortened work week, etc)

Lastly, I lived in Paris long enough to see the ghettos and the tenements and they are just as bad as the inner city in LA.  If you think otherwise, you are deluding yourself and really need to wake up to the ills facing your nation.  I am in NO way saying that the US is better or should be some sort of example to other countries, I am just saying that from my experience, the situation for the working poor in france is not that great.

&gt;One philosophy is based on making an assertion and then asking if it can be disproved. If nobody can disprove it, you accept the assertion.

But that's has nothing to do with the rejecting ideas that ""cannot be falsified""....on the contrary, this is *accepting* ideas that cannot be falsified.

Abandoning claims that ""cannot be falsified"" is classic critical rationalism ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_rationalism ). Karl Popper championed this approach to science and I'm having real trouble with your attempts to relate ""cannot be falsified"" with religion....it seems the complete opposite. 

&gt;The other philosophy is based on making an assertion and then proving it to be true. Once it is proved true, you accept the assertion. This is known as science. example: God exists, or reincarnation exists. Can you prove it? No? Then you can make no assertion as to the validity or invalidity of the claim.

That depends on what you think the relationship between ""proof"" and ""truth"" are.

I could prove the statement *""The Mona Lisa is beautiful""* by asking the opinions of a large sample of intelligent people (who would most likely agree with the statement). I could, in turn, draw the conclusion that the statement was ""true""....

I could say ""All swans are white"" and set about collecting a large sample of swans and test their ""whiteness"". I would collect a million white swans from across Europe and eventually draw the erroneous conclusion that the statement *""all swans are white""* was true...until I went to Australia and saw a black swan.

Additionally, laws of physics can be proven to be false under certain circumstances but they are not entirely abandoned. Newtonian liquids and non-newtonian liquids spring to mind. Your counter-argument would be *""These laws operate under different circumstances and you must take that into account""* but wouldn't that argument also apply to statements like *""reincarnation exists""*. If I said that reincarnation existed in a metaphorical and symbolic sense (which more Buddhists claim) and not a literal-physical sense, do I need to prove the symbolic value of reincaration to know that ""reincarnation exists""?

I don't think your account of ""truth"" and ""proof"" is adequate but maybe that is slightly digressed. I return to my original question:

&gt;What's the difference between ""cannot be falsified"" and ""cannot be proven to be true""?

The South is thought of as having been the protector of slavery, motivated by a unique racism that persists today.  Overlooked are the economic pressures that in the past were lifted because of a threat of secession, the almost complete political division along geographic lines, and many other points that give a much more reasonable picture of what was actually happening in the pre-Civil War South.

People seem to have the impression that the South was a driving force behind perpetuating and expanding the practice of slavery in the 18th and 19th century world.  In reality slavery had been the main source of labor since before the first known civilizations began.  The resistance to ending it was uncertainty about what would happen, economically and culturally, without it.

People seem to think that the South was especially racist even though it is pretty clear that the general consensus of the time that white Europeans were superior to blacks.  It is partially why several Northern and Western states ended up with laws prohibiting blacks (not just slaves), not born in those states, from entering.  It was also why the the country Liberia was created after the Civil War.  Many hoped the freed slaves would go back to Africa rather than remain in American society as inferiors.

The idea that the South is more racist still persists, but if you go to any small Northern or Western town, more than 50 miles outside a major city, you will find all the racism that is supposedly indicative of the South.  The difference is that you won't find many black people there since the vast majority of them still live in the South.  This contributes a lot to the stereotype of Southern racism.  Black/white conflicts that can be pointed to as racially motivated don't happen very often in Vermont or Utah because there are hardly any black people in those states.  Now, there are some non-Southern cities where large black communities exist:  New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, for example.  All of those cities saw pretty much the same events (civil disobedience, marches, riots, etc.) as Southern cities during the civil rights era and a few brief periods since then.

I was going to go into some of what is usually ignored, but this is already longer than I intended it to be.  A couple of points are mentioned in the first paragraph and it would not be hard to find more from there.

&gt; The South is thought of as having been the protector of slavery, motivated by a unique racism that persists today. 

I think the key phrase here is ""a unique racism"".  I believe you are quite correct here and elsewhere that white supremacism has been the defining attitude in terms of race relations between Europeans and their descendants, and everyone else, worldwide, since the beginning of the colonial era.  Its virulent and institutionalized persistence in the USA seems unique to me though.  More on that in a bit.

&gt; In reality slavery had been the main source of labor since before the first known civilizations began.

True, but race-based slavery without the reasonable hope of manumission and integration into society is a particularly cruel and uniquely American form of slavery.  By which I mean America in the hemispheric sense, as I am sure any supporter of Evo Morales would tell you, American race-based slavery is not only a black-white thing.

&gt; The idea that the South is more racist still persists

I do think (as a foreign observer) that the US is highly divided along racial lines, even today.  I live across the river from Detroit, I am under **no** illusions that there is not widespread racism north of the Mason-Dixon line.  

&gt; when put in context the bad guys don't seem as bad and the good guys don't seem as good.

A fair point.  To me, again as an outsider, the wound that race-based slavery has left on the US is still a huge problem today.  The racist ideology required to support this institution does not go away overnight, or even over a century apparently.  ",1233879707,1,1,t5_2qh0u,[deleted]

&gt;Oh, and I really want you to respond to these arguments, about Lot, Abram, Pharaoh and all that. Don’t try to evade them by introducing other new arguments you think could be controversial or atheistically convincing from the Bible. Face these responses first—don’t make me play tag with you.

Oh I'm sorry, I thought I was speaking to one who ""apostelitizes""?  If you're not here to preach and all, then STFU and get a life.

&gt;Let me tell you, you really love to assume things. Prove to me by showing me a statement where I did agree to all these things. These people were putting God to the test. What I did mention is atheist’s tendency to generalize all Christians as being that way. They think Christians are morons. Isn’t that Christian bashing?

And what you're doing, your pathetic trolling, isn't atheist bashing?  Don't fucking sit there crying wolf while eating the damned ship, hypocrite.  So Christians who lead the Crusades, plunged Europe into the Dark Ages, lead to the percussion of women as ""witches"", refused basic medical treatment for a child (who eventually died), believe that God or his son Jesus supports one football team over another, who believe God prefers one Nation over another (even though there are Scriptures that God hates nobles...), and have stunted science and medical research for centuries, are somehow *not* morons?  Interesting line of thinking you have there... yes, you seem to not account for the [sins of Christinaity](http://www.inplainsite.org/html/church_history_dark_side.html) and the fact that there are disputes over [the context of the Bible itself](http://nobeliefs.com/DarkBible/darkbible2.htm).  Face it: if Christianity truly preached nothing but peace and love, and love of God, there wouldn't be a reputable history of Christianity being bastardized and used to dominate man over man, which oddly the Bible criticizes at Ecclesiastes 8:9.  If people really stuck to just the peaceful scriptures, they wouldn't be killing each other over it.

Also, your cute little group of 7 ""ways to be an atheist on reddit"" isn't assuming anything about atheists, now is it?  Bigot.  And yes you are a bigot for holding your opinion over those of atheists simply because you're a damned Christian.  The same excuse could be used for any religion, thus no religion can really state they are better than the other [or lack thereof].  At least atheists don't have a major historical record of centuries of warfare and manipulation...

&gt;Free speech is free speech. Do I not have 7 good points when I said them? If they are good, then why do you flame me? If they are bad, prove to me that they are—and that’s why you have been trying to do. I hope that my responses to your criticisms have “shed some light”. And because I hold my posted comments responsible, I will answer to any opposition. Oh just because you couldn’t differentiate the tenses “had” from “have” doesn’t mean that we belong in the same camp. Since you question the Bible, why can’t I use the Bible to come up with logical answers? If you don’t even want to consider other factors like the historical period, cultures, and various other background that the Bible was written in, then I offer you this fallacy.

Problem with the Bible is in regards to the interpretation of literal versus figurative texts (such the eye plucking out one), the battle over the different churches debating over what is/is not canonical, and which scriptures are made application of (such as Mosaic over the Messianic Law in some churches).  If the book had one solid message, you, me, the guy down the street, and Joe Blow could all read it and come to the same conclusion.  What physical evidence can you present that shows your own particular sect of Christian faith is above the others?  What proves one right over the other?  Latida, there are groups of Christians quoting the Bible in *support* of [anal sex](http://www.sexinchrist.com/) from a scriptural basis.  

&gt;This attack is based on a sentence that you misread. Seriously, can you differentiate between the tenses “had” and “have”? Is it different to say “I have happiness” as compared to “I had happiness”? Learn to read English before you pick up your machine gun and do what atheists are so good at.

Oh I'm sorry, I guess I forgot about [Christianity dominating](http://www.geocities.com/b_r_a_d_99/mission.htm) other people throughout history, and were quick to persecute ""nonbelievers"".  How could I be so foolish?  Again, you're a hypocrite because you're squawking because I heavily disagree with you, when in fact your own religion has been ""disagreeing"" with people throughout time, and killing them over it.  Don't apply the double standards of your God to the argument, kiddo.
Honestly, I did misread your quote, and you are right on that one, I'll give you that.  Point still remains that Christianity has ""picked up the machine gun"" extensively throughout history, so don't even *go* that route.

In conclusion, I responded to a handful of your attacks on atheists to show your own double standard, as you yourself deviated from the main topic to slander as well, so I gave it right back to you.  Fair is fair, now I think we're even.  In general, my main questions above were rhetorical and meant to make you think, not necessarily respond.

That may make it your homeland, but it doesn't make it your homeland to the exclusion of all others. Many groups have history as long as the Jews in the area - as I have shown with the genetic evidence presented in another thread that you have seen.

&gt;conversion to Islam and exclusive participation in Arabic culture entailed (by choice a damn large portion of the time) a full denial and renouncement of their previous heritage.

So, from what you are saying, if I convert to Islam or Christianity, or anything else for that matter, my house and my family cease to be mine?

&gt;You can't be a Jew when it's convenient and an Arab Muslim the rest of the time, particularly when becoming an Arab Muslim meant saying a big ""fuck you"" to the other Jews.

That's a pretty big claim. First Judaism is an ethnic group and lineage, so those Jews who converted probably considered themselves Islamic Jews at the time, there is no way that we can know. And as far as the 'fuck you' goes, who knows why they converted, they are all dead now.

&gt;As I've stated elsewhere, if these descendants of Jews wanted to actually be Jewish again, I'd welcome them.

Why should they conform to what you think being Jewish is. They have the same descent as you, their ancestors made a different faith decision. Why does that make them any less entitled to the land. They haven't out-bred any more than Jews, in fact it's likely that they have out-bred less since it's clear from the genetics that European Jews married Gentile Europeans.

&gt;That's like a white man with 1/16% black heritage playing the race card politically while telling full-blooded and full-cultured blacks to turn down the damn jungle-noise hip-hop.

Given the fact that Palestinians are likely to have out-bred less than European Jews, they are actually more likely to be more closely related to ancient Jews than are European Jews with their intermarriage with Europeans.

But U.S. liberality would probably correspond roughly with middle-wing politics elsewhere and so at least connect on some level. Or to put it another way, U.S. conservatism is (rightly or wrongly) vaguely what these places have left behind while U.S. liberality vaguely approaches what they have become.

So once you hit a truly international community the conservatives are going to find themselves in a minority because the others find common ground. Not because U.S. conservatism wouldn't hit home with other conservatives in the world, but because it simply doesn't exist to the same degree in any countries on a similar ""level"" internationally.

The main reason is less malinvestment in basic infrastructure.  For example, many parts of Europe also had a housing bubble.  But they didn't go crazy building McMansions, the prices on existing housing just went up a lot.  So even if housing prices collapse, the houses in the EU are still fundamentally sound, meaning that they tend to be a reasonable size, and are built close to public transportation.

In contrast with the USA, we've been building out like crazy in far off suburbs of Phoenix, and in places like the Inland Empire in CA.  Most of that investment, and more importantly the resources, will end up being wasted.

We're still in for a world of hurt, because as the global economy recovers, we won't have the energy resources to keep growing as we are used to.  That's going to force a major restructuring of our way of life, for everyone around the world.",1233924034,1,1,t5_2qh1s,ansible

Capital punishment isn't about justice, it's about vengeance. The reason for this is that government is not in the business (theoretically) of making moral judgements - the reason something like murder is against the law is because murder is damaging to the survival of society and we, as a society, have decided that we don't want to live in a society that allows its citizens to kill one another with impunity. It's a perfectly rational approach.

This is why many european countries choose 'life' imprisonment or rehabilitation even for murderers, because they are not making a moral judgement but, by means of the justice system, have discerned that the criminal is out of orientation with the society in which he lives and poses a threat to it.

Now, for me, the idea of rehabilitation (or re-orientation as it is also known in some countries) is also quite suspicious, denying a person the right to be who he chooses in order to safeguard the wider society.

Instead, what we should be doing (in my opinion) is setting up walled communities for such persons, allowing them to create the societies in which they want to live and, therefore, demonstrating that their approach and philosophy (or lack of it) is fundamentally unsustainable. If you want to kill people, see how long you survive in a closed society where it's perfectly legal.

I would be curious to see how this would work for thieves and con-men, would their society evolve along collectivist / communist lines with regards to personal property? Or would the most successful thieves create their own little kleptocracies?

It's very hard to be critical of the Israeli government and its politics, without being labeled as anti-semitic. A few years ago Europeans voted Israel the number one threat to world peace, this was before september 11th 2001. Israel started calling Europeans anti-semitic and the EU apologized, even though it was, and still is, an Israeli political problem. 

I believe that most people who are critical of Israel are so, because of the Israeli government and its politics, not because the majority of the Israelis happen to be Jewish. Israel and many Jewish people really need to learn to separate Israel from Judaism. 

The  Buddhist doesn't get upset if I'm critical of Japan, nor does the Greek Orthodox Church call me names if I believe that the Greek government is composed of muppets.

&gt; I haven't read a single source ever claiming Christianity were some kind of women's liberation
movement, nor that it in any way revolutionized or even slightly changed the fact that the woman was man's possession.

You should read more then. I'm not making as strong a claim as some of your text entails: I'm not claiming that Christianity is feminist in the modern sense, or that it upholds equality of men and women. My claim is weaker: that Christianity sets out, ideologically, a stronger position for women than there existed before in many societies where it was received (I'm mostly limiting my claims to Europe here because it's the history I know reasonably well.)

&gt; Au contraire, the Christian creation story and countless passages in the Old Testament cemented the inferior position of women. The Bible condones polygamy.
Abraham had several concubines. The Old Testament also describes in detail how to sell a woman, how to keep her, and how to deny her a long line of freedoms
available to men.

One of my points is that you shouldn't confuse the mythical aspects of a religion with the actual results it leads to. The fact that a religion has goddesses, for instance, has very little to do with the way it prescribes to treat women. The Tanach does not condone polygamy as such, or at least not unambiguously: this is a question still debated by Jewish legal minds today. Whether it does or not is secondary to the fact that Christianity institutionally was never accepting of polygamy. As I said, you need to separate more clearly between prescriptive aspects of a religion and other textual components.

&gt; In the New Testament, the chauvinist Paul keeps repeating how man is the head of the woman. Women are supposed to be subjugated, covered, modest and owned.

Sure, this is quite true, and in no way contradicts my point. There are different levels of opression, not only 1 and 0. It's not a boolean variable.

&gt; Your link describes how a couple also in pre-Christian times were interrogated as to both give their consent to union. Consent between marrying parties
was not a novelty brought by Christianity, and neither was it practiced much differently with Christianity than without. It was a business-deal. And the
woman was a trade-good. If you think she magically got free will with Christianity you are just being naive.

The difference is one I went over: the constitutive and central place of consent in the Christian institution of marriage. I'm sure many women got married by force in Christian societies, but I'm sure many people got murdered, stolen from, etc. It doesn't mean the religious institutions approved of either. Marriages could be anulled in Church courts due to all sorts of defects in consent: violence, intimidation, fear, deceit... So yes, the change does exist and is relevant, even if it isn't equivalent to the standards of today.

&gt; And your link talks alot about how homosexuality was regarded by religion. I know Christianity regards it a sin already. That's hardly a secret. You aren't
answering my question though. I wanted you to demonstrate that people were in fact practicing less homosexual behavior after the invention of Christianity,
than before (and how is that good for the woman again? I kind of don't understand that either, as women can be homosexual too).

I think this is quite simple. I've shown you sources which explain that male homosexuality was regarded by the dominant pre-christian societies of the time as acceptable or even desireable. I have shown you how this changed after Christian times. Is what you're claiming that social approval and legal sanction have no influence on people's actions whatsoever? Do you actually think that a world in which your friends would praise you for choosing a youth to love and a world in which you'd be burned for it would lead to an equal number of people engaging in the behaviour?

As to why male homosexuality is good for women, I went over it on a previous post on this very same thread.

&gt; The anti-male-homosexual stance of Christianity
tends to make men seek satisfaction through women, which increases the exchange value of the commodity they have at hand, if you catch my drift. Same thing
with prostitution: making marriage a precondition for sexual satisfaction augments the bargaining power of females, at least in the context we're speaking
of in which females had a higher burden from engaging in sex (pregnancy, child-birth, social oprobrium).

&gt; Of course I know you can't demonstrate such a thing, cause the only impact Christianity and its inhuman interpretation of nature had, was moving activities
underground. Not eradicating them.

Erradicating them? Surely not. But decreasing them? I'm reasonably sure it did. Fear of not being burned is a great motivator. Certainly some pre-christian activities like temple prostitution and institutionalized pederasty seemed to have been sharply reduced.

&gt; You seem to think Christianity improved life for women, yet you haven't showed a single piece of evidence for it other than your own wishful thinking.

What sort of evidence do you want? Many if not most early Christian converts were women. The juridical status of women before Christian courts was higher than before Roman or Greek courts. Etc. christianity probably became a reactionary force with regard to the status of women around the renaissance at the earliest, I'd say. It certainly is one now. But it wasn't one at its inception. Same as Islamic family law was, believe it or not, a relative advance over existing Arab custom.

Yes, I would agree, cause to me it doesn't really seem you're claiming anything at all. I was initially reacting to whoever called Christianity a ""women's religion"" which is insane. Christianity has always been a man's religion with a male god stipulating male superiority in every matter. 

&gt; One of my points is that you shouldn't confuse the mythical aspects of a religion with the actual results it leads to. 

The actual result it led to was 2000 years systematic oppression of women. Religious scholars will never stop debating the bunch of incoherent crap they believe in, cause it is a bunch of incoherent crap.

&gt;religious institutions approved of either

Religious institutions and the male clergy led the oppression of women. And in many places in the western world to this day, religious institutions are the hardest places for women to get accepted as opposed to secular society.

On homosexuality, that was something you (or the other guy) at first projected as something good for women, because suddenly men stopped having sex with men. Two faults with that reasoning, and both faults still stand: Women are also homosexual, and men didn't stop having sex with men. They just stopped doing it in public.

Therefore, your imagined argument on imagined parameters of stuff that never happened is false through and through. No bargaining power for women demonstrated. You being ""reasonably sure"" is again, guesswork. I think you're being reasonably naive as to how much it's possible for a person to suppress nature.

How does the story go, about the Catholic priests and the altar boys?

Christian converts didn't necessarily have any choice. I come from a country that was in its entirety converted by violence. Believe in Christianity, or be dead. 

No woman can ever be proven to have written anything in the Bible. Nor did they play any central role in the Bible. Nor did they play a central role in church (hardly none to be honest), nor did they get any special protections from the church (in Europe the opposite is true). How you make this out to be a women's religion is astounding. 

Who knows, if it weren't for Christianity perhaps female emancipation would have come several hundred years before it did.

Edit: And I thought this whole time, that you defended the ""women's religion"" part of it. If you're not defending that, then sorry, but I'm just not sure what you're arguing about. ",1233931086,1,1,t5_2qh2p,Crestina

&gt; Fact: I am not a shill for the insurance industry. In fact, I am the past president of a physician-patient health care alliance that has vigorously opposed the health insurance industry and its many nefarious practices.

Whatever...something I cannot confirm or challenge.  So I will take your word for it.

&gt; Fact: Serious researchers have concluded that breast cancer survival rates are higher in the United States than in any other country in the world. See the study in the leading British medical journal The Lancet Oncology, August 2008, Coleman et al.

I am guessing ""serious researchers"" = insurance company lobbysts.  I will give your statement some credit since the US does have an advanced medical system...assuming you have the cash or coverage.  One would THINK that cancer survival has a better chance in the US.

&gt; Fact: Government financed health care across the world rely on rationing and denying access to expensive treatments in order to make care affordable. One of the ways they do this is by denying access to cancer drugs. See BBC articles like UK 'Worst' on Cancer Drug Access.

Partially true.  Triage (determining the seriousness of disease) determines which the level of care you will typically recieve, outside of yearly preventive care (check ups, dental cleanings, etc) which is typically 100% covered.  Thus if a person gets is a car wreck is critically injured, he is not going to be waiting in line for 2 weeks, he gets in now, whereas a cancer patient caught early enough might wait for a short period.  People who will likely die regardless might end up on a long wait for experimental care.

Also, why are the European systems rated much better than the US as well as have longer life expectancies over the US?

&gt; The solution...

I am not sure what the solution truly is, but what you are advocating is no different than what the Republicans does.  Get a high deductible policy and save money into a health savings account which you LOSE if you do not use it.  That is a shit plan.

I make a six figure income and I CANNOT afford that plan.  I pay extra money for lower deductibles because I have no other choice.

I like the idea of a single payer system.  Hell I do not even have a problem with a paycheck deduction knowing I can get care and not have to mortgage my whatever or sell things to pay off bill for the next 10 years.  I could care less who manages it, the government or a nationalized insurance company.

&gt; In the mean time, go ahead and stick your head in the sand, down mod anyone that presents facts contrary to your beliefs and stay ignorant.

Mother fuckers sticking their heads in the sand is exactly why were are having this problem now.  It is exactly why there are free health care days provided by charities here in Ohio and Kentucky where thousands of people show up to get free care.

Insurance companies pay lobbyists millions a year to make sure this problem DOES NOT get solved.

We need a solution and SOON.  I highly doubt I will be able to afford any health insurance plan in 10 years (maybe 5) and the number of uninsured people in this country GROWS, not shrinks, DAILY.  And if I cannot afford health insurance or care on a salary exceed $100,000/year, what does that say for people who make less than that?  Which by the way is a majority of the population of the US.

The question you should be asking here is: as opposed to what? Do you think, or have you any reason to believe, that Christianity as compared to pre-Christian religious institutions increased opression of women? There was systematic opression of women before Christianity and outside the Christian world, so I don't see how that can be the result of Christianity.

&gt; Religious institutions and the male clergy led the oppression of women. And in many places in the western world to this day, religious institutions are
the hardest places for women to get accepted as opposed to secular society.

The decontextualized quoting you did didn't refer to equality of men and women as a whole or to women being accepted inside religious institutions, but to consent of the woman being a necessary, central and constitutive element of the Christian institution of marriage. If you have something to argue against that, go ahead. Otherwise you're mixing up the issue, arguing with someone else. I'm clear on the fact women can't be priests on many churches, and even in some churches it's still taught today they should not seek power or employment outside the home. That's nothing to do with my point.

As to homosexuality: you may notice that I always clarified I was speaking of the Christian anti-male-homosexuality position. The Christian churches as far as I know never bothered too much until recently about female homosexuality, I'm not sure why (possibly didn't even think of it, they all being males). You think I'm naive about the power of societal pressure and laws to change behaviour set by human nature, I think you're naive about the purported unchangeability and permanence of human nature. Otherwise, but the number of males involved with other males in Athens, we'd have to have a lot more male homosexuals than we seem to in modern society.

&gt; Christian converts didn't necessarily have any choice. I come from a country that was in its entirety converted by violence. Believe in Christianity, or

Sure, and entirely irrelevant to my point. Did you notice I spoke of early Christian converts? I'm referring here to the early Church, when it didn't have temporal power and it was often persecuted by the state. Basically the epoch before Constatine's change of policy. During this time Christians weren't converting anyone by the sword, and many women voluntarily joined. They may have been mistaken, but they probably thought they were getting a better deal at the time.

How does it do that exactly?

&gt;providing nationalised welfare and healthcare.

&gt;They believe the government's foremost responsibility is to answer to the people and make sure their basic needs are met.

Who defines ""basic needs""?

&gt;After that, they're free to do whatever they need to prosper.

&gt;I don't care how you want to label this, but it's something that the US desperately needs.

Says who?

&gt;Ooh, I get it! You attend the Church of the Free Market Fairy! Why didn't you warn me this was a religious discussion?

?

&gt;Really? Because a quick Google search tells me the models I want to look at, Sweden and Norway and such, are weathering this crisis better than the US.

Since when were Norway and Sweden more socialist than the US?  They have less intrusive governments, corporations there pay lower taxes, they don't spend $1 trillion a year overseas maintaining any sort of empire, their regulators are not as corrupt as ours, and they value saving and investing over consumption.

Norway and Sweden are better not because they are more socialist, it is because the governments there are less powerful, intrusive, and less of a drain on the economy.  Our government is the largest government the world has ever seen.

You have to stop thinking that the US is a model of a capitalist country.  It is not.  The US has been on an economic decline for many years, directly as a result of government intervention in the market.  The last generation of government politicians inherited a capitalist country, and turned it into a backwater republic.  The US economy is not the largest in the world.  The EU economy is now the largest.  China is expected to surpass the US in the next generation.  No, sorry, the US is as about as capitalist now as the Soviet Union was just before it collapsed.

&gt;I'm not talking about Marx's final communist economy where everybody owns everything and nobody owns anything.

Then you are not talking about socialism.

&gt;I'm talking about managed economies, the current socialist model

Managed economies are not socialist economies.  Socialist economies are economies whereby the government owns or controls all of the means of production.

&gt;that take advantage of capitalism's ability to generate wealth and distribute goods tempered with government oversight to manage the economy and provide for the needs of the people.

That is the definition of a ""mixed"" economy.  Furthermore, capitalism *does* provide for the needs of the people.  The needs of the people are expressed by the choices they make in where they spend their money.  You have to look at what people are doing with their money in order to make any statements on what they ""need"".  You don't know what someone needs just by looking at their faces.  You have to watch their actions.  Only *they* know what they need.  You shouldn't presume to stand on your high horse and tell me what I or anyone else ""needs"" without asking first!

&gt;This is what people mean when they talk about modern socialism.

They are not talking about socialism.

&gt;I comprehend that it doesn't match the original model, but then again, democracy doesn't match the original conception practiced by the Greeks.

In what way?

&gt;The concepts have evolved; deal with it and move on.

That's called not taking ideas very seriously.  That's called changing one's convictions as frequent as changing one's fashion.  Good ideas shouldn't have to change.

The reason hardly anyone uses the old definition of socialism is not because socialism qua socialism changed, it is because people's minds have changed regarding the destruction socialism wreaks on people.  At first, the intellectuals though that socialism could work, because it was ""planned"", and ""rational"", and ""made things fair"".

After socialism collapsed in the 20th century, mainstream economists and intellectuals did not take this to be a collapse of socialism, no, they still think it can work, but rather they took it to mean the collapse of reason and human rationality.  After the wall came down, they saw the destruction socialism caused and said ""if *this* is reason, to hell with it!"".

Now people think socialism still works, it's the human mind itself that cannot be trusted.  Therefore we need to ensure ""consensus"" and ""agreement"" and ""democratic business operations"".  That way, no one mind has the ability to destroy other people's lives, because the individual's mind cannot be trusted.  We need to ensure ""everyone has a say"", that way we  can wipe out individual critical thinking and questioning.  Truth now comes from what the majority believes.  Truth cannot come from one person's mind, for the mind cannot be trusted.  We need to look at what the majority believes, and consider that the truth.

Have I summed up your thinking?  *That* is the true problem with this society.

&gt;I have no problem with people pursuing capitalism to generate wealth and goods.

Then you cannot have a socialist society.

&gt;I have a problem with capitalism free from regulation and oversight.

That is different than welfare and healthcare and all the other things you want in society.  Wanting regulation and oversight is not the same thing as wanting progressive taxes, welfare and healthcare.

&gt;We've dabbled seriously with free market principles twice in the last hundred years, and both times we came closer to ruin the closer we came to your mythical ""pure"" capitalist model.

Tell me the exact time frames you are referring to.  I can say for sure you are totally wrong before you even say anything, because your statement is totally false.

&gt;I agree, we're not ready for a pure socialist model as envisioned by Marx.

Pure socialism was tried.  In the Soviet Union.  The Soviet government mandated that all the means of production be owned by the state.  It failed.

&gt;But then again, Marx was applying Hegel's dialectic to economic and social theory and trying to derive a final solution, which is a violation of Hegel's dialectic to begin with.

Since when did the Hegelian dialectic become the standard from which we judge good philosophy from bad?

&gt;My paper was about how we adopted socialist principles in the US through Roosevelt's New Deal, but refrained from actually adopting the entire philosophy. The result was an unprecedented era of prosperity and productivity.

Have you ever heard of the phrase ""correlation does not mean causation""?  Roosevelt's policies caused the Great Depression.  It was only when these policies ended after the war did prosperity return to the US.  

If you knew your history, as any friggin *high school* student knows it, you would have known that the fastest economic growth in US history took place *during the industrial revolution*.  Not during the New Deal.  The New Deal caused the US economy to stay in a depressed state for many years.  Roosevelt's policies were modeled after the fascist Mussolini's model.

&gt;Gradually conservative elements worked to discredit socialism and eventually, during the Reagan era they repealed many of those socialist policies.

On the contrary, government spending massively increased during the Reagan years.  Inflation massively increased during those years as well, which culminated in the crash of SnL.

&gt;That's where my paper ended, because we were still in the Reagan administration.

Great how only time can refute fallacious ideas huh?

&gt;Now, twenty years later, we've seen that Reagan created a ""bubble"" economy by allowing businesses to pursue fraudulent business practices geared toward maximizing wealth without actually producing anything.

The bubble was caused by the government.

&gt;They shuffled numbers around on paper and called it ""growth."" It was sustained, for a time, by the technological boom of the nineties, but after that it was doomed to crash once again.

It was false growth because it was built on false money.  If that growth took place on real money, it would have been real growth.  The Fed caused the tech boom and crash.

&gt;The Free Market is a myth, symbolized appropriately by a pretty fairy waving her magic wand to create wealth out of nothing.

Only to those who don't understand it.

I completely disagree and I don't think this has been demonstrated either. Society changes, and it might well be that society changed regardless of the introduction of Christianity (which in its' OT form was pretty goddamn barbaric).

&gt;The question you should be asking here is: as opposed to what

I can imagine 100 alternatives, but it's a hypothetical thought experiment which is entirely useless. So I must stick to the one reality we've got, and in that reality, Christianity was used for oppression of women.

&gt;consent of the woman being a necessary, central and constitutive element of the Christian institution of marriage. 

Consent of the woman, or her father. In most cases, the latter had more to say than the former. In the cases the woman were allowed by her pater familias to make her own decisions, I don't see any pattern of this freedom being any more prevalent in Christianity than any other religion. Culture had a far bigger impact here than religion (and remember that at least here in Europe most people remained multi-religious and still are today, keeping their old gods alongside the Christian god).

&gt;I know never bothered too much until recently about female homosexuality, I'm not sure why

Cause females to Christianity are ""a womb"" and nothing else. We don't matter.

On homosexuality, this is a pattern found in several hundred animal species in pretty consistent numbers. In most species, about 5-10% of the total population display homosexual behavior. Same for humans. This is genetic, and not cultural. 

For the wealthy Romans and Greeks in a very short period of time, man-on-boy love was a an ideal of culture (it was considered the purest form of love), but that was hardly engulfing world society as a whole. 

Christianity's main goal with strict polygamy was to control every aspect of human life, and to restrict sex, emotion, and anything else that took focus away from the spiritual realm. It wasn't to liberate women. 

Some women might have converted (perhaps cause their husbands did), but this is what they converted to:

[""From the early patristic age, the offices of teacher and sacramental minister were reserved for men throughout most of the church in the East and West.[13] Tertullian, the second century Latin father, wrote that ""It is not permitted to a woman to speak in church. Neither may she teach, baptize, offer, nor claim for herself any function proper to a man, least of all the sacerdotal office"" (On the Veiling of Virgins). The Alexandrian father Origen argued in his commentary on 1 Corinthians 14:34, 35 that female prophets never spoke publicly in the assembly.[13] Similarly, Epiphanius of Salamis claimed that ""Never from the beginning of the world has a woman served God as priest"" (Against the heresies)."" ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Christianity)

So whatever their motive, they were obviously prepared to be subjugated in every religious matter.

&gt; My argument can be summarized in very few words: Christianity when it was introduced reformed social institutions, customs and laws in a way that entailed modest but not irrelevant advances for the position of women. That's it in a nutshell.

I completely disagree with this statement. I believe Christianity systemized oppression of women in large parts of the world that didn't previously have a monotheistic father figure to beat them over the head with, and forced both men and women into very narrow and unfree relations that Christians still try to shove down people's throats to this very day.

True,,False,atheism,t3_7vcie,,1425921048,0,t3_7vcie,c07ifmt,0,,t1_c07ifmt,0,False,"A few general points:

&gt; A moral thing has always been the things that benefit the society and keep it harmonious.

That's getting it backwards.  The morals that survive tend to be those that benefit the sort of societies in which they're practiced.  Not because societies necessarily have any mechanism that prevents the institution of retrogressive morals, but because societies cursed with retrogressive morals tend to collapse, taking with them their culture, including their morals.

Or maybe the argument you're attempting to make is that, no matter what we may judge to be moral, the actual, objective moral thing will be whatever's best for society.  But that too seems backwards.  After all, some people could argue that our society is better off excluding certain groups of people, or that we're best served by sanctioning the torture of anyone who could alert us to threats against our society.  Sam Harris has demonstrated the slipperiness of the latter sort of argument.  Does a given moral claim's propensity towards furthering the survival of a society necessarily make it moral?  No, because ultimately morality is a supervening level of judgment.  We use morality not only to judge the propriety of behavior within a society, but also to judge the society itself.  And ultimately we may say, any society that seems to justify certain forms of behavior (slavery, torture, expansionism) as a requirement for its survival is, itself, immoral.

&gt; Basic things that are thought to be moral or immoral are very universal in all societies. Stealing, lying or killing is very universally forbidden as they always affect negatively the smooth working of the community.

I'm always skeptical of claims concerning so called universal morals.  For example, in some Islamic societies there's a doctrine sanctioning lying if it's necessary to defend against religious persecution.  In Roman-era Germanic societies, killing wasn't murder so long as you declared your intent to do so beforehand and took credit for the killing afterward.  Incest was formerly considered a universal taboo, but it's since been found common in certain cultures, and besides, what counts as incest differs from culture to culture.

&gt; Followers of Islam or Christianity have never had such moral qualms, but through centuries the followers of these faiths have actively been encouraged to attack those who don’t share same religious tradition.

That's a gross generalization, and doesn't bear up under scrutiny.  Both Christians and Jews fared well in Moorish Spain, for example, and in contemporary societies tolerance for minority religious traditions by the religious majority of any given region is obviously the rule rather than the exception, or we'd all be embroiled in constant factional religious violence.  Both [Christianity](http://www.religioustolerance.org/tol_bibl.htm) and [Islam](http://www.answering-islam.org/Hahn/mappe.html) provide scriptural support for toleration, and if Judaism does not then we can at least count it as historically fortuitous that they have almost never turned to violence as a means of converting others.

&gt; The democratic legislative process creates legislation and juridical system sees to it that it is obeyed.

This makes no distinction between morality and legality, but there are important differences.  Legality is more closely associated with the maintenance of society, and any laws no directly related to that purpose will tend towards injustice.  The scope of morality is different -- for example, while it may be a legal obligation not to park next to a curb that's been painted yellow or red, it's certainly not a moral obligation.  And morality may extend beyond legality -- that it's not illegal to lie to your wife about going out drinking with your buddies, most people would consider it immoral.  Personally, I'd argue that the similarities between a society's legal and moral codes should ideally be a matter of coincidence or overlap, not direct relationship.

&gt; Sam Harris has rightly pointed out that there is no more criminality in the almost atheistic countries of the Northern Europe than there is in the on the surface very Christian Southern European countries.

This harks back to the difference between legality and morality.  If legality is not tantamount to morality, then the lack of criminality in a predominantly atheist country would not necessarily serve as an index of how moral its citizens are.  After all, legal curbs would remain operative -- people would still be penalized for criminal activity.  Even if an atheist in such a country saw nothing particularly wrong with killing his neighbor, he would likely refrain for fear of incurring the legal penalty.  The real test would be how often they conform to morals that aren't reproduced by the law.

&gt; Richard Dawkins for his part has pointed out that a situation where only the fear of punishment after death prevents a human being from acting badly is in fact morally corrupt.

Again, referring back to the equation of legality and morality, couldn't the same be said of a situation where only fear of punishment *before* death?  The real question, I suppose, is that of how often we're presented with situations in which some sort of personal negative consequence isn't at least implied.  In other words, how often are any of us truly capable of behaving morally, by the standard Dawkins gives us?

&gt; They inherited those morals from their predecessors who had an quite identical set of morals...

The time has long since come for the Congress to abolish the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, also known as the FDA. Contrary to the baloney put out on the various pages of its web site, which would lead the unwary taxpayer into thinking that the FDA is actually protecting him or her from some hazard, the FDA has outlived any usefulness its partisans and bureaucrats have claimed for it. Getting rid of this bureaucratic dinosaur would save taxpayers nearly $1.7 billion (the proposed fiscal year 2004 budget), lead to reductions in the prices of food and drugs paid by consumers, reduce lawsuits over product liability, and reduce the number of lives lost and lives shortened due to a lack of drugs and medical devices.

What the FDA claims to do

With a history that dates back to 1848 when Congress required the U.S. Customs service to prevent adulterated drugs from entering the United States, Congress has expanded the FDA’s regulatory authority over food and drugs over the years, all in the name of protecting consumers from any risks associated with food, drink, or drug use. Major milestones (or millstones, for taxpayers and consumers) include the Food and Drugs Act and Meat Inspection Act, both of 1906, which gave the FDA’s predecessor agency power to enforce prohibitions on the interstate commerce of misbranded or adulterated food, drinks, and drugs.

While many of the food-related functions have been transferred to the Agriculture Department, the FDA retains considerable authority in this area, notably in dictating food-labeling standards and in dictating the types of claims that can be made by manufacturers of vitamins and mineral supplements.

As far as prescription drugs go, the FDA has been given additional authority over the years. Notably, in 1962, after the sleeping pill thalidomide was found to have caused birth defects in children born in Western Europe, the Congress passed and John F. Kennedy signed into law amendments to federal drug laws that required pharmaceutical manufacturers to prove to the FDA the effectiveness of their products before marketing them in the United States. Despite the apparent Congressional intent of reducing the risk of using pharmaceuticals to zero, unsurprisingly, the FDA has failed to do so. Instead, FDA began the process of dictating standards for clinical drug trials and tests and conducting a lengthy approval process that a manufacturer needed to pass before bringing a new or modified drug to market.

Beginning in 1976, the FDA was given authority to apply a similar ""drug-style"" approval process to all medical instruments and medical test equipment.

The FDA has failed

This attempt by the government to insure consumers against the risk of using drugs and medical devices has flopped on numerous occasions. First of all, FDA regulations have often prevented U.S. consumers from gaining access to new life-saving drugs. Examples of this include major delays in the marketing of drugs used to treat cancer, blood pressure, heart attacks, cholesterol, and strokes and delays in marketing such high-tech items as cardiac pacemakers and in the use of such techniques as balloon angioplasty for blocked coronary arteries. For many years, the FDA would not allow the makers of aspirin to claim on their product labels that aspirins thinned blood and could thus save one from dying if taken during a heart attack. The costs of FDA regulation of these markets has likely run into the billions, possibly hundreds of billions, of dollars and is composed of higher drug prices, fewer drugs, and more and lengthier illnesses and earlier deaths.

In a call to the Bush Administration to merely reform the FDA, Henry I. Miller, a fellow at the Hoover Institution and the Competitive Enterprise Institute and a former FDA official, presented a devastating critique of the FDA’s regulatory process and procedures.

In his early 2001 editorial commentary, Dr. Miller stated that the total time it takes to develop a new drug had doubled since the 1960's. And the costs to a manufacturer of bringing a single new drug to market had risen to over $400 million, the highest cost in the world. He further contended: ""Costs are spiraling out of control because the FDA meddles endlessly in clinical trials and keeps raising the bar for approval."" Furthermore, he cited statistics that showed the average number of clinical trials per average drug increased from 30 in the early 1980's to 68 during the 1994–95 period while the average number of patients in clinical trials for each drug more than tripled! As expected, the average time required for clinical trials for a new drug rose from 85 months in the first half of the 1990's to 92 months in the last half of the 1990's.

And FDA approval of a drug has not been a guarantee that one was or is using a safe drug. This latter contention was once again confirmed in a Sunday, May 18, 2003 New York Times article about trial lawyers focusing their efforts on launching mammoth lawsuits against pharmaceutical manufacturers.

Life without the FDA

While many in the medical community like Dr. Miller believe that sensible regulatory reform of the FDA should be the goal, instead the FDA should be abolished.

Some – possibly many – are about to ask me: ""Grichar, are you nuts? What makes you, an economist and not a medical expert, think that the drug companies and medical equipment manufacturers can be trusted to regulate themselves!"" To which I would respond, ""They will not be regulating themselves; the free market will regulate them.""

And here is how that could be done. In the absence of the FDA and with trial lawyers looking for multi-billion dollar settlements in lawsuits, pharmaceutical manufacturers and medical equipment manufacturers have every incentive to be cautious in bringing out new drugs and new medical devices. To this end, they would avail themselves of independent private reviews of the results of clinical trials and tests.

Medical experts – the same ones who testify on behalf of and against manufacturers in various product liability lawsuits – would also become involved as independent private review consultants. Most likely, such experts would become affiliated with independent private review institutes – similar in operational philosophy and techniques to the famous Underwriters Laboratories – which would levy a charge for a review of a new drug or medical device. Currently, the FDA takes in about $250 million annually in fees (really taxes) it charges manufacturers for seeking approval of a drug or medical device. Manufacturers have thus demonstrated the willingness and ability to pay for product reviews.

Insurers might also help fund such independent review boards or institutes, as this would help lower their pay-outs in lawsuits. And contrary to what some may think, medical experts would have every incentive – mainly significant future earnings from participating in drug and medical device and procedure reviews from the independent review institutes – not to take bribes from manufacturers. (For a great description and analysis of what of Underwriters Laboratories does, see What Keeps Us Safe by Mark Thornton.)

If given a seal(s) of approval by accepted review institutes, the new drug or device would be brought to market with that seal(s) publicly displayed. Physicians, who often have to spend a fortune for malpractice insurance coverage, would have the strongest incentive to prescribe, in most cases, only those drugs or those devices that have some seal(s) of approval. Their malpractice insurer would demand that. However, physicians would be free to seek an exemption from their insurer and the consumer in cases where application of a new, but not-yet mass marketed or reviewed drug or device, might make the difference between life and permanent disability or death.

Manufacturers would also be given an extra incentive to seek such expert seals of approval for their new drug and medical device products by their insurance companies, mainly in the form of lower premiums for liability insurance if they get a seal(s) of approval. Those not getting recognized approval would face higher liability insurance premiums, possibly suspension of coverage for those particular products, and likely lower demand for such products. Getting a number of seals of approval, from these strictly independent private review institutes, would further enhance the marketability of a product and help insulate the manufacturer from lawsuits.

Under the free market, insurers would also have the incentive to offer consumers no-fault liability insurance for medical malpractice, including the use of drugs and devices that have not gotten a major seal or seals of approval by generally accepted review institutes. And consumers would have a strong incentive to purchase such insurance.

With such a private market system of insurance and risk reduction, there would be fewer lawsuits and lower settlements. This would be the case because of the extensive and competitive review of products, seals of approval, and also review by various insurers. It would be difficult for even the best trial lawyers to counter numerous expert opinions rendered in such an unbiased manner prior to the sale of a specific drug or medical device.

Dump the FDA!!!

To sum it up, a private market for the review of drugs and medical devices could save the public billions of dollars. Not only would the public (including drug and medical device manufacturers) save the $1.7 billion it pays in taxes and fees to fund the FDA, but effective drugs and devices would be brought to the market more rapidly and at a lower cost. More lives would be saved, there would be fewer permanently disabled, and illnesses would be shortened. Lower lawsuit awards and settlements would more than likely compensate for any extra costs of reviews.

If you study Church history, you will find that there have been many movements to break away from this Catholic mixing. Modern American Christianity considers itself ""protestant,"" which links back to the days of the ""protest"" against the abuses and corruptions of the state church(es) of Europe. There have been many reformations and movements that have sought to return to a more pure truth.

The result is a complete splintering of the Catholic tradition. It still has many false references and traditions of paganistic religions from Egypt, Greece, Persia, India, and various other places that really don't have much to do with Jesus or the Old Testament tradition at all.

we’re only three weeks into it! If you will recall, 2008 was a pretty bad year for the
banking sector. For example, the shares of Citigroup, Bank of America, and the Royal
Bank of Scotland fell 77%, 66%, and 92%, respectively, in 2008. So far this year
(remember, this is only three weeks) the same stocks are already down 50%, 55%, and
74%, respectively. Like we said, 2009 has already been a pretty bad year! For as bad
as 2008 was, 2009 promises to be a whole lot worse. The problem isn’t just the banking
system anymore. The problem is the banking system and everything else. This year, the
financial crisis of yesteryear is morphing into an altogether different animal. It’s
morphing into a financial crisis that has an economic crisis layered on top of it. In fact, to
call the current environment an economic crisis is likely understating the situation. What
we really have is a global economic catastrophe. One where weakness only begets
more weakness, causing a vicious circle that is proving nigh impossible to reverse in
spite of all the world’s financial, economic, and political brain trust throwing everything
they have, including the kitchen sink, at the problem.
In our last article, “Surviving the Depression”, we mentioned how the world is witnessing
depression-sized declines in economic activity. We mentioned how auto sales in the US
were down almost 40%. How housing starts were down almost 50%. How industrial
production is falling off a cliff, with each month worse than the last. How jobless claims
are at multi-decade highs. How consumer confidence is at multi-decade lows. How the
company surveys we follow are showing dramatic declines across the board in
economic activity. We challenged the idea that this is a run-of-the-mill, minus-low-singledigit
recession and we characterized this Depression (there is no other way to describe
it) as “global, pervasive, and deep”.
In the month since we wrote that article, the data points have only gotten worse, and
they will likely have gotten worse still by the time you read this article. US housing starts
fell a further 15.5% in December to 550,000, the lowest on record. US industrial
production fell a further 2.2% in December, to a 7.8% year-over-year decline. If you
think that’s shocking try this on for size: European industrial orders (a leading indicator
of industrial production) are down 26% year-over-year, the largest decline on record. Or
how about Japanese exports plunging 35% in December – shocking, isn’t it? Global
steel production was reported to be down 24% in December. All over the world,
dramatic rates of decline in economic activity are being reported. The most disturbing
developments have been in employment, which took a marked turn for the worse thus
far this year. US jobless claims are now running almost 600,000 per week. You don’t
want to annualize that number, but you may have to. Layoff announcements have been
coming fast and furious since the beginning of the year. If we were to list them all here it
would take several pages. We are seeing dozens of layoff announcements on the news
each and every day. On Monday alone there were lay off announcements totaling
70,000 workers. There isn’t a single industry we can think of that is unscathed. A few
examples: Circuit City (retail) laying off 30,000. Citigroup (banking) is planning to lay off
52,000 over the next few months. Microsoft and Intel (computers) laying off 5,000 and

And you're suggesting that CEO's are the only people in America who work insane hours? Working single moms do the same for a heck of a lot less pay.

&gt; and it's not just skill set, remarkable one in a million people are out there - steve jobs, maybe obama, etc.

So *some* CEO's are brilliant enough to actually justify their insane compensation, fair enough. But for every Steve Jobs there's ten who run their companies into the ground. See: Detroit, Wall Street.

It's also notable that most of the ""remarkable"" ones built their company from the ground up and made their millions because they have an ownership stake in said company. The ones who went to Harvard Business School, got hired by their Dad's friend as a junior executive and then eventually made the right connections on the golf course to get picked as CEO by a board of directors don't tend to deliver Steve Jobs-like performance.

&gt; and this is a global economy. top people can just work for foreign banks which don't have the salary caps - creating a market where us companies have the bottom of the barrel people - ultimately destroying all the us companies

Have you compared the average compensation of a CEO in Japan or Europe to those in the US? We're talking a tenfold difference or more.

Somehow Toyota managed to find a CEO that works for just under $1 million and managed to take his company to the best selling automobile maker in the world. Meanwhile the CEO of GM is paid nearly ten times that in annual compensation and had to come crying to the federal government for a bail out.

Additionally, I think that as residents of the Middle Eastern area, it makes not sense for the Israelis and the Arabs to war with each other; they could do far better to make peace at the expense of the nations that come in and suck out all the oil.

I think the Middle East conflict is perpetuated by outside forces who want to keep the region ""weak and pliant"" to use Zbig's Grand Chessboard terms, plus right-wing, xenophobic racists dedicated to preserving distinct identities for various mixed motives within Israel and neighboring states.

There is much confusion over whether h1-b people work for less.  There are two factors in play:
One is that if you get fired, it is tough to find work b/c many employers just don't grok the whole process--it is too complicated--but it is even tougher to take the kids out of school and sell the house etc. .

Also, Lenin had spoken of the possibility of it in 1915 (see his article *On the Slogan for a United States of Europe*) and even more so after 1917 (see his 1923 article *On Cooperation*), and even Trotsky was not entirely clear on the matter (see his 1925 pamphlet *To Socialism or to Capitalism?*).

You say that socialism in one country is something that Marx would not have supported. Recall that Marx also thought that socialist revolutions would first break out in the advanced capitalist countries. And of course it did not happen that way.

The key here is recognizing the difference between a *perspective* and a *theory*. The idea that socialist revolution would occur first in the advanced capitalist countries in western Europe was not part of the *theory* of Marxism. It was simply a perspective (or expectation) based on what seemed most likely at the time (mid-to-late 1800's). There were large urban working classes in those countries, so it seemed that's where it would happen first. Lenin, however, showed that it was actually more likely to happen first in the ""weakest links"", i.e. where the bourgeoisie had been weakened the most. That it turned out to be Russia was due primarily to the effect of WWI, something that Marx and Engels could not have known about in their time. Lenin and the Bolsheviks, by the way, were attacked mercilessly by the Social Democrats in the old Second International for this supposed ""heresy"" against Marxism.

This is analogous to Stalin being criticized for the supposed heresy of ""socialism in one country"". Again, it was a *perspective* that such a thing was impossible, based on what appeared to be the overwhelming strength of the capitalist world. No one could've imagined, before 1917, that a lone socialist country could hold out for more than a few years against such a powerful enemy that surrounded it. But again, this was not elevated to the level of *theory*. And events, primarily WWI, changed that perspective. The war had weakened most of the capitalist world. That's why their attempts at intervention were for the most part fairly weak. They tried, to be sure, but the intervention was defeated, as were the attempts at economic strangulation. Against all odds and expectations, the young Soviet republic survived, and built socialism. And it did so without significant help from workers in the west.

This, by the way, is where Trotskyites fail the most: the substitution of abstract concepts (""socialism is impossible in one country"") versus taking *concrete reality* and changed conditions into account. I would argue it's the primary reason why Trotskyism failed to gain any kind of significant following in the working-class movement.",1233985789,-3,-3,t5_2qjii,TheAntiRudin

-1 August: A pickup truck carrying six Georgian police officers is hit by two remote-control explosive devices (IED) close to a Georgian enclave north of the city of Tskhinvali. Five policemen are severely wounded. Later that day,separatists open fire with machine guns and grenade launchers on the villages under Government  control  Kvemo Nikozi, Zemo Nikozi, Avnevi, Ergneti, and Eredvi. Attacks also are directed at Georgian police and peacekeepers checkpoints. In the village of Nuli, one person is wounded and several houses damaged. Georgian peacekeepers checkpoint in Sarabuki comes under attack. In the village of Ergneti, one person is wounded and two houses are damaged. Separatists reported, that six separatist  militia are killed and 12 wounded after Georgian police open fire in response.

-2 August: Six civilians and one servicemen of MIA of Georgia are injured after separatists shell villages under Georgian control in the conflict zone overnight. The villages of Zemo Nikozi, Kvemo Nikozi, Nuli, Avnevi, Eredvi, and Ergneti come under intense large-caliber mortar fire the separatists.

Far from it: they have this thing with Freemasons (and Hospitals), but most locals assume it's a marketing gimmick. The magazine market targets 'notable': local, conservative elite — but calling them anything more would be excessive. They were among the several magazine that, a few weeks after the events, echoed a Messian (a senior, out of the mainstream, rather left-wing, journalist)'s book claiming that no plane crashed in the Pentagon — rather critically, but that was a blunt argument to have at that time. Since, that thesis has been ridiculed, albeit a lack of evidence. Some Truthers are annoying, but most simply find that too many elements are missing, and want to know more.

I personally think that any data on what impact (or temperature) would make such towers collapse need to be revised, if not for political reasons, to insure other similar construction stand. Same for the Pentagon: you don't 'waste' such a crash without investigating how a plane can damage a construction.

Aw, c'mon.  We had a revolution and a civil war.  What's Iceland had?

Seriously, though, do you really thing history plays that much of a role in political and economic choices, bouncing back and forth?

Personally, (and I admit that I'm certainly guessing here myself, and that's it's easy to armchair historian and come up with all sorts of nonsense) I kind of think that it has more to do with what happened at the end of the age of aristocracy.  When Europe created her modern economies and governments, the movement was reparationist, trying to get back the disproportionally-allocated resources from the aristocracy.  It was only through constant effort that the aristocracies were pulled apart (France) or brought down to the level of the common man (the UK).  When the United States created *her* economy and government, sentiment was *very* anti-classist...but it amounted mostly to wanting an aristocracy to never *arise*, so that we could earn our own way without anyone taking anything from us.  There wasn't incredible wealth to *get* from anyone anywhere -- almost everyone was involved with farming.  So our national sentiment and direction was built up around not allowing an aristocracy to form -- the US has a bit more of a skepticism about government being created and what it might take from people than does Europe.

I don't see why you'd call the United States [fascist](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Fascism).  The term is quite general and broadly used, but Wikipedia has the following:

&gt;Fascism is an authoritarian 

The United States is one of the more *anti*-authoritarian countries out there.

&gt;nationalist

Yes, the US is nationalist, very much so during Bush.

&gt;ideology focused on solving economic, political, and social problems that its supporters see as causing national decline or decadence.[1][2][3][4]

Eh...I don't really see that.  The closest thing to that would probably be social conservativism.

&gt;Fascists aim to create a single-party state in which the government is led by a dictator who seeks unity by requiring individuals to subordinate self-interest to the collective interest of the nation or a race.[5][6][7]

Certainly not.  Our President doesn't have a recall vote, but he's no dictator.

&gt;Fascist governments permanently forbid and suppress all criticism and opposition to the government and the fascist movement.[8]

No.  The United States is very open to political criticism.

&gt;Fascist movements oppose any ideology or political system that gives direct political power to people as individuals rather than as a collective through the state (liberalism, democracy, individualism); that is deemed detrimental to national identity and unity (class conflict, communism, internationalism, laissez-faire capitalism); that protects and enhances the power of ""weak"" people rather than promoting ""strong"" people (egalitarianism); that may oppose major changes to institutions and cultural values that it proposes (conservatism) and that undermine the military strength and military ambitions of the nation (pacifism).[9][10][11] [12][13][14][15][16][17][18]

Most of that really, really doesn't fit.  Bush pushed some socially conservative values and was militarily aggressive, but it is hardly anti-individualist or anti-laissez-faire or anti-democratic.

&gt;Fascist movements promote violent conflict between nations, political factions, races, and other groups of people as part of a social Darwinist and militarist view that conflict is a natural process and a part of evolution.

Mmmmf.  Maybe under Bush, with ""Islamofascism"".  The Cold War would qualify, I guess, and [Manifest Destiny](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Manifest_destiny), if one goes back far enough.

&gt;Do you know what's really shocking?

And, yet, we see people protesting across the Arab world against Israel, we see people protesting across Europe against Israel, we see people protesting in the U.S. and Canada against Israel. And don't give me the bull that the U.S. funds Israel so it is right. The U.S. funds Egypt, the money we use to fuel our cars funds Saudi and Iran and the terrorism those countries support. So stop apologizing for this.

&gt;This is close to what is going on with Jewish protests against the Israeli Government because all Jews have a right of return to Israel, so the Israeli Government is at least potentially their government.

That is nonsense. That they have the right to return does not make it their government. And, again, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians live other than Gaza and the West Bank. Hamas says they act for all Islam and there are a billion plus Muslims in the world.

&gt;Since the vast majority of Arabs outside Gaza are not in the set of Arabs described above they would not be protesting against their own government

Yet they protest Israel. Does that make them secret Jews?

&gt;the Gazans, these people are in risk of being hit by IDF snipers and bombs.

And, again, are you honestly saying that the Gazans don't protest Hamas out of fear of **Israel**? It was nonsensical the first time and just as nonsensical now. You have built a castle of pure sophistry. How about this for an alternative: those Gazans and Palestinians and Arabs strongly support Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians? 

&gt;Now I accept that people do protest against other governments, but perhaps it is seen (not just amongst Arabs I should add) that Israeli behaviour is more warranting of protest?

So 3,000 war crimes by Hamas last year are not worthy of protest. Israel's response, though, is seen by all as horrible. Perhaps this is part of why Israel sees itself as isolated and sees that it has to act this way. Clearly the world does not care for the lives of Israeli civilians.

&gt;The claim of racism comes from the fact that you group all Arabs together

Yet I didn't except to ask why none of them seemed to be doing a specific thing. That is not racist. If, particular, in fact none of them are doing it. It seems that you are calling me racist for referring to Arabs. Yet there is a move for pan-Arab nationalism, there is book after book of Arab history, there are CDs of Arab music sold, etc. But somehow because I ask about ""Palestinians and other Arabs"" I am racist. I see you referred to Arabs, you racist.


&gt;Does that clarify what I said?

At no point did I misunderstand (except for the questions I asked again above). I **disagree** with you, not fail to understand.

The writer leaves open whether this was righteous punishment or not. It's the kind of ambivalence that is sort of suspect. Remember, this is part of the old school, real anti-semitism that was widespread in Europe as well as the US not long ago.

The other dubious passage was this:

Well, you would first have to wait for a government to form before paying the reparations. I agree that it would be useless to start flooding the country with money in the middle of a civil war. But mine is more a discussion of principle than of practice. The point is that if the US were to apply the same principle to itself as it does to others, it would decide to pay reparations. Of course that's very far from happening, but if it did, then you would have to discuss things like who the recipients should be, etc.

It's true that no country exists in a vacuum. I think, like Iraqis, that no country should interfere with another's internal affairs. By far the most disruptive interference, though, is and has been the US. That doesn't excuse Iran or Saudi Arabia from meddling, but there is a huge difference in scale here.

Because IF the ABCT is true, it has a lot of clear predictions f.e. in a recession capital goods will fall earlier and bigger than consumer goods and at the next boom capital goods will gain more than consumer goods etc. etc. and I figure an advisor can use the theory and break it up to exact investment advices.

I found Peter Schiff and Mark Skousen. 

I chose Mark Skousen because somehow looked like a more professional guy, but strangely, he was generally bullish or level-ish, he cautiously but trusted the Fed,  etc. Very strange for an AE guy to say... So I dropped my subscription after he was proven wrong.

Meanwhile Peter Schiff always predicted doom, gloom and apocalypse. And his suggestion was to invest into Asian stocks. Well, guess what, Asian stocks didn't perform that well either. Everybody knows Asia is export-driven, driven by American, British and European consumption. 

So, I'm at the moment out of advisors I'd trust. I think ABCT is generally correct, because besiders the usual aprioristic proofs, Lachmann more or less proved it empirically too. It's predictive power is fairly reliable and that's what counts. 

But apparently it doesn't have enough predictive power to really, REALLY be able to tell exactly what will happen and when. 

Nothing else has either, AFAIK, so at the end of the day it seems investment is back to guesswork. Sigh. But I don't even want to be rich, I just don't want to lose what I have against inflation.

That's oversimplified and misleading, IMHO.  In *practical terms*, yes, Ron Paul would probably produce more alteration in drug law than Obama would, but I'm not sure that that means that he'd be a fan of the same, just that he wouldn't prevent it.

Gay/Lesbian marriage would likely be the same under Paul or Obama.  Obama takes what looks like a single marriage standard across the states (as he's opposed to DoMA), is also opposed to same-sex marriage, but also is opposed to having a federal marriage amendment to ban same-sex marriage.  As far as I can tell, that would pretty much be the status quo.  Ron Paul is opposed to the federal marriage amendment and in favor of DoMA, which would result in a varying marriage standard across the states.  In practice, my guess is that that would wind up pretty much being the same thing (especially as I doubt that DoMA actually has any effect other than making explicit what courts would probably rule anyway).

I think that the claim that Obama is a ""big government shill"" is pretty loaded.  He's certainly a fan of more federal spending than Paul, but then, so was every other Presidential candidate.  I don't think that he wants to ""destroy personal liberties"", either.

&gt;I just don’t get why anyone would be on the Obama bandwagon, he can hardly speak a sentence without uttering multiple fillers within each thought, and then everyone calls him a great rhetorical speaker.

He's young-looking, handsome, has a smooth-sounding voice.  Paul has a thin voice and looks old.  I like Paul, but aside from maybe the ""kindly old grandfather"" image, he just isn't plain as sellable via appearances.

&gt;This guy is one of the biggest puppets ever set up, and now he has everyone wanting to have their cake and eat it to.

I don't think that Obama is a puppet.

Nor do I think that he's a radical liberal (as the GOP ads would have it) *or* anywhere near as revolutionary as his campaign made him out to be or likely to change as many things.  He's a fairly mainstream centrist Democrat, honestly.  There are very few policies that he's advocated that really drastically differed from Hillary Clinton's.

I wish Paul could have made it in, but he *did* make a good run, did some important coalition-building -- the idea that third parties can present a united front is valuable, and put some important ideas out there.  I kinda think of him as acting like the canary in the mine for a number of other politicians.  If Paul can go out and say that Policy X is a good idea and not get beaten to a bloody pulp on the political stage for it, then maybe it's okay to go ahead and say things like that.  He criticized the US-Israeli relationship, *strongly* condemned the Bush-era wars even when they were starting out (if you remember, there were few Democrats who were willing to do so and no Republicans, certainly not in the kind of terms he used), and a number of civil liberties infringements.

Finally, he took a more intellectual approach to politics that sort of seems to me to have gone missing.  You may not agree with him, but arguing about the merits of monetary policy or actually bringing up the *long term consequences* of our foreign policy was something that was in very short supply during the race.  When you've heard nothing but simple jingoism for the past eight years and then right next to McCain saying ""I don't want to fly with a Muslim -- they only want one-way tickets"" to have him launch into an argument about our historical foreign policy was a relief.  It reminds people that we really can aspire to something better.  Obama avoided the jingoism, but has a bad habit of going for rather empty warm-and-fuzzy statements (which I guess I can't fault him for -- Bill Clinton did the same thing often enough, and he was quite popular).

Finally, I can certainly raise some criticisms of Paul, even if I really like the guy.  I agree with most of the conclusions of Austrian economics, which Paul is a fan of, but I'm skeptical of its reasoning.  Paul had plenty of goals -- ambitious ones -- but was weak on practical, point-by-point steps for reaching those.  Eliminate the DEA?  Okay.  Now tell us how you intend to transition to that -- since it was created in the early 1970s, the Drug Enforcement Administration's taken on the role that normally state police forces would handle.  That's a real, major, logistical issue, and if you seriously promote it, you're going to have your hands full -- it would involve a lot of redelegation of responsibilities  and major policy changes.  The same goes for hard currency, and the other federal police forces that he wants to phase out (ATF, FBI).  Do these become state agencies, private companies that provide forensics services to police, what?  Okay, you've made an argument that there are real inflationary concerns associated with fiat currency.  Now tell me how we can move to a hard currency, something that resolves those.  Are you going to back every existing dollar?  That'd be phenomenally expensive.  Are you going to back new dollars?  If these are too major to accomplish in one term, give me some realistic proposals.  Even if you don't win, someone can take that policy and refine it and adopt it, if it's been hammered on, but you need to have concrete policy proposals to criticize to get somewhere.  It's concrete policy that gets adopted and compared, not goals.

I had real practical concerns about at least two issues: first, phasing out the FCC -- I don't think that the FCC can honestly be handled at the state level.  It deals with a resource that simply ignores state boundaries.  I'm not sure how frequency allocation is handled in Europe, but I imagine that even if there are agencies in each country, they probably work as more or less one European agency to deal with the problem.  Second, Paul wants both no international treaties requiring free trade *and* to have low tariffs.  That might be more ideologically pure to free markets, but I'm not convinced that it's *practically* more useful.  Bill Clinton created a large number of free trade agreements that are a pain in the butt to break (despite complaints from labor), and as a result, it's difficult for the country to shift away from a free-trade environment with at least some countries (when Bush tried with steel, it resulted in international outcry).  That might be more pragmatically effective at ensuring free trade.  I understand his concerns about creeping centralization of power, but I think that avoiding protectionism is more important.",1234022770,1,1,t5_2qh63,generic_handle

They want the same standard of living that we in the West have and they're going to get it no matter what anyone else has to say about the matter.

They grew up with a set of conditions where that sort of thing is reasonable.

Let me try and present what a neoconservative view might be.

* First, the world is not a nice place.  Countries are out for themselves.  If the USSR had the ability, it would have seized control of Middle Eastern oil, and so forth.  We have a unique opportunity to establish a dominant American presence.  Europe is perhaps building itself into a competitor continent-state, but isn't there yet, and doesn't act as a whole.  The USSR, the old rival, is broken.  China and India have a long way to go before they become serious rivals.  By establishing ourselves and entrenching ourselves around the globe, we have the ability to extend our power for a long time to come.  Perhaps in the future, we would never be allowed by a more powerful China to establish military control over much of the world's oil supply, but today, China can do nothing.  As a US policy wonk, our goal is to serve US interests, just as Chinese policy people serve Chinese interests.  The best we can do at our job would be invade and fortify the Middle East.

* Second, people don't want to go to war.  This is nothing new.  We need a good-versus-evil narrative to get people fired up and ready to support the policies that we advocate.  We had propaganda against the Germans and the Japanese in World War II -- a much more mild form, some jingoism, and appeals to cultural clashes with Islam, might get people ready to fight and die.  In particular, people in the US value democracy (and in a bit of sentiment left from colonial and Wilsonian times, self-determination).  If we frame the issue as liberating, bringing democracy and freedom to some people, more will be willing to engage in the conflict.  In general, most people in the country are less-educated and probably less capable of cool, calculated action than us.  The primary concern is in presenting a them with a story that will get them to buy into our policy; they may not agree with that policy if it is fully exposed to them.

* Third.  The returns from military dominance over the globe are worth the (large) costs.  Today, retaining military dominance means having a significant technological advantage in weaponry.  Over time, weapon technology leaks to competitors, which means we must maintain a large, active arms industry.  Since this industry cannot sell our most-powerful weapons to just anyone (preferably not even allies), it must rely on heavy national subsidies.  A large amount of spending on weapons is acceptable.

* Fourth.  The rest of the world has little real power to influence us, and irritation is transient.  Best to ignore it, take action, and let feelings fade over time.  If we can obtain support for our actions, great.  Otherwise, don't worry about it.

* Fifth.  Spending buys popular support.  Historic conservative rejection of spending is costly and pointlessly ideological.  Cutting taxes will keep many of those heavily-taxed happy, and when eventually the budgetary situation becomes dire, we'll have an opportunity to force reduction of spending in other areas.

Essentially the onboard computer that picks up information from the [balises](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balise) placed on pretty much every point of interest along the track/lines.

I'm pretty sure this steam locomotive has been fitted with the electronics necessary, as it's been through certification and now runs on a charter basis on the mainlines(link to that around here somewhere...)

The ATC/computer/warning system picks up information for a number of upcoming [blocks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_signalling#Block_signalling) and relays that information to the driver. 

Whenever a signal is at red/stop, the train/driver essentially knows this way ahead of time. At the very least he'll find out at the signal before the one set to stop, or at a pre-signal signal(all set to distance based on the maximum allowed speed for the line). 

The computer calculates the distance(and other variables such as the trains braking ability, length and such set by the driver) and unless the driver decelerates fast enough, applies brakes by itself. The brakes go off in stages, but unless negated(with a button push) and equalled manually by the driver(prerequisite for negating it), it'll soon apply the emergency brakes and simply empty the trains entire main airline, thus quickly applying full brake strength throughout the train. If the variables put in by the driver, based on the information on the train(length, weight, maximum speed, etc...), works out, the train should stop ahead of the signal. Worst case scenario it'll drive by the signal, but usually not by much(unless something is *very* wrong). This has happened to me. [EDIT: nothing *very* wrong, I only rolled past by a few feet. VERY embarrassing though, as an instructor was sitting *right next to me*...]

Far as I know it does not power down the loco. Not sure about all models, and I can't think of any situation where it's required...

The track circuitry you're describing is correct. Electric locomotives send power back through one rail and up certain suction thingies(behold the edge of my technical cunning...) back to the power station, thus 'closing the circuit'. I'm not sure about the generators on diesels, or what they'd be for. I'm missing something, I'm sure...

What I immediately thought about when I read track circuit was the block signal system. Basically if you connect one rail to the other, as train axles do, the remote controlled block system picks this up as a train on the block(setting signals leading into the block to stop). You can pretty much put the entire system through chaos with some copper wire, covertly setting whatever block-stretch you feel like to permanent 'stop', guaranteeing a frustrated repair team(if you hide it well enough ;)

---Adam was roaming around the Garden of Eden making up names for all the animals that were there. He also noticed that there were two kinds of each species - male and female. And he also noticed that most of the animals were mating and seemed to be enjoying this very much. So, he went to his special place and called out in a loud voice, ""Hey, God!"". And a loud booming voice replied, ""Yes, Adam"".

Adam: ""Hey, God - There's an awful lot of animals down here.""

God: ""Yes, Adam - I have created many species and I trust you have not run out of names for them.""

Adam: ""No, that's not the problem. But, I have noticed that there are two kinds of each species.""

God: ""Yes, Adam. One kind is male and the other is female.""

Adam: ""Hey, God - why is there a male and a female of each species ?""

God: ""So they can mate and procreate. This will ensure the continuation of the species.""

Adam: ""Hey, God.""

God: (sigh) ""Yes, Adam.""

Adam: ""Which am I?""

God: ""You, Adam, are a male.""

Adam: ""Hey, God, I've noticed that most of the animals are mating --- and they seem to be really enjoying themselves. If it isn't too much trouble, do you think...maybe,....I could...""

God: ""All right, Adam. The time has come for me to provide you with a mate. Go lie down and when you have fallen asleep, I will create your mate.""

So, Adam leaves his special place, finds a patch of soft grass under a tree, lies down, and falls asleep. Some time later he awakes (possibly due to a slight pain in his side) and heads immediately to his special place.

Adam: ""Hey, God.""

God: ""Yes, Adam.""

Adam:""Hey, God - did you remember to do what you promised ?""

God: ""Yes, Adam. While you were sleeping I created for you a mate. Her name is Eve. You will find her in the bushes near the place where you were sleeping.""

Adam rushes off to find Eve in the bushes. A few minutes later he is back at his special place, calling ...

Try to hold more than one thing in your head at a time.

That people are protesting against Israel more than Hamas may reflect a general sentiment that Israel is more the aggressor in this conflict.

&gt;That is nonsense. That they have the right to return does not make it their government.

***Potentially*** I said - thus giving Jews a sense of proprietoriality.

&gt;Hamas says they act for all Islam and there are a billion plus Muslims in the world.

But the rest of the world's Arabs may not see it that way, please get it into your head that I am not talking about a connection from a government to people, but people to a government/nation.

&gt;Yet they protest Israel. Does that make them secret Jews?

Don't be stupid. Again, it would be because they see Israel as the greater aggressor (either because they naturally side with Arabs or because they have rationally come to the position that Israel is being the greater aggressor - probably a mix of the two).

&gt;you honestly saying that the Gazans don't protest Hamas out of fear of Israel?

It was a rhetorical device initially, but yes, I do think it's a factor - not the entirety, fear of Hamas and just the the plan day to day struggle of surviving getting food and water are probably more significant. And there would be a significant emotional connection to Hamas as the perceived power that is fighting against a persecutor.

&gt;those Gazans and Palestinians and Arabs strongly support Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians

Sure, as I said immediately above - now ask your self why. And be honest about it, it is not just because Arabs naturally hate Jews - this is a new thing that has resulted from Israeli behaviour.

&gt;So 3,000 war crimes by Hamas last year are not worthy of protest.

I didn't say that.

&gt;Israel's response, though, is seen by all as horrible.

Remove the word response and replace it with actions and you have a more honest statement. Yes, Israel's actions are in the main justifiably seen as horrible.

&gt;Perhaps this is part of why Israel sees itself as isolated and sees that it has to act this way. Clearly the world does not care for the lives of Israeli civilians.

Victimhood is getting boring from one of the greatest military powers on Earth.

As far as you drivel about racism, yes there is the notion of the Ummah of all Islam, but as I've restated above there is not necessarily any connection between non-Gazan Arabs and Gaza, so why would those people feel responsible for the actions of Hamas enough to protest against them. My point has been that Jews, often in my experience, do feel a sense of connection and responsibility for Israel even if they do not live there and are not citizens.

&gt;At no point did I misunderstand (except for the questions I asked again above). I disagree with you, not fail to understand.

It's nearly impossible to carry out research on scheduled drugs. Even licensed scientists, such as [Alexander Shulgin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin), have had their labs raided after publishing material that the government doesn't like. Barring compounds from study makes it virtually impossible to voice any dissident opinion, because no concrete evidence can be produced contrary to propaganda. Thus, the laws themselves become justified because the proof is lopsided and there's no way around it. 

Cannabinoids are virtually the safest molecules we know of. For medical or recreational use, the only adverse effects seem to be impaired working memory while under the influence and/or undesired feelings. Research should be encouraged, not hindered. Studies have shown THC and other cannabinoids to be: [neuroprotective](http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/21/17/6475) and [anti-tumoral](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17952650?ordinalpos=1&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;linkpos=1&amp;log$=relatedreviews&amp;logdbfrom=pubmed).

To respond to some of your other comments that you've made in the thread below, you'll see from the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNER_Peppercorn_Class_A1_60163_Tornado) that this train was built with improved brakes (over the originals in its class) and features Automatic Warning System (AWS),

It certainly seems from the ""Certification"" section of the Wikipedia article that plans are in place for the train to undertake regular mainline services.

One thing is clear: Obama is fearless and gives everything his all. And he is burdened with a great responsibility. However, he is also just a person, and we in Europe should not believe that this new US president can fix everything by himself. 



SPIEGEL ONLINE: Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Obama to work more closely with Europe. Do you think there is a danger that, in this crisis, the US might shut itself off from the outside world? 


Verheugen: No. The US is not going to build any high walls around the country. Obama has offered close cooperation to all those who have goodwill. 


SPIEGEL ONLINE: What if Obama does not succeed in turning things around? Won't the US bring Europe down with it? 


Verheugen: Enough of all these doomsday scenarios! It will be difficult, no question; but we are not on the edge of some kind of abyss. The upward force of the world economy did not just disappear from one day to the next. There are still millions of people in emerging economies, such as India and China, that are striving toward more prosperity. They won't be stopped by this crisis. There is power in technological progress.

So 3,000 dollars is plenty...depending on your country.  If you go to Europe it will be difficult.  Your 3,000 dollars will disappear.  First you need to pick a place to start.

Then you are going to teach English.  Go to Daveseslcafe.com and start reading everything.  Check out the jobs forum and read all about the countries.  To make good money you can go to South Korea, Japan, and China.  You can even go to Saudi Arabia if you want.

In South America the money is good...if you live in South America.  What I mean is when I return to the U.S. I will be broke.  However in Mexico I have had a very high quality of life.

Sell your car if you can.  Really sell anything you have to get some more money.  Get a credit card for emergencies.  Pick a country.  I recommend teaching English because the market is huge.  I never had problem finding work in Mexico, ever.

If you really want to backpack around that is different.  Plenty of people backpack through Lao, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand...all great places, teaching English.  You can easily go to a country and stay six months and then move on.  Personally I hate travelling, but I like living in other countries.  So in my time in Mexico I lived for a year in Chiapas, then moved to Mexico City, and have been here for the last two years.  Not moving is the reason I ended up making money.  But yes you can backpack.

Also 3,000 dollars is a lot of money in South America, and all of Mexico.  Plenty of people come to the United States with less.  

Do not be afraid.  I too was afraid when I went to Mexico.  Most of my friends, who had never gone (except to Cancun) told me I would be kidnapped or killed etc.  I believed them, but I still went.  I discovered they were very wrong.  Once you go to one country suddenly the idea of going to new places is no longer scary.  The first 6 months to a year are really hard.  I recommend always trying to learn the native language.  Spanish is useful because of the amount of places you can travel to with it.  Thats one of the reasons I came to Mexico.

If you do decide to pursue ESL you will have to get a TEFL certificate.  There are many ways to do this, and if you want anymore information feel free to message me.  And good luck!  And don´t worry, you can easily do this in the next six months.

What I meant is not that food from ethnically diverse sources is not readily available in the British Isles, but rather that, since the British Isles consist of a landmass that is roughly the size of the state of California and that is virtually climatically homogeneous throughout, whereas the US is a continent-spanning nation, there is a much greater degree of variation throughout the US in terms of what is readily available for food purposes.  

You will say that there are a huge variety of imported items available in any major city in the British Isles, and while this is true on its face, it has been my repeated experience that, for example, the produce section in a US supermarket is far richer and fresher in variety of content than is the case in its British Isles counterpart.  

Reason; it's quite simple.  The UK and Ireland are island nations at a relatively high northwestern latitude which means that outside of ""hothouse"" products there're a lot of food items that they simply cannot produce year round and must accordingly ship from places like Spain and Portugal.  The same is not true of the US.  At any time of year you may choose to name, there is a huge variety of food products being produced throughout the continental US.  That's what I meant when I wrote that there is more variation in the US.  

That said, ultimately I think it's an unfair comparison.  How do you begin to compare the cuisine of geographically isolated North Atlantic islands to that of a continent-spanning nation?  You don't.  It's stupid.  You'd be better off comparing European and North American cuisine.  At least then you'd be working with comparable quantities.      ",1234060223,1,1,t5_2qh13,serpentjaguar

You will learn a huge amount in a month and then you can plan for a bigger trip.   
If you've been employed at your job for a long time, you could ask if they'd be open to letting you take a month out.  The worst they can do is say no.  There's no need to talk about how much you hate your life/job - just say that you're looking for an opportunity to broaden your horizons and gain more life experience.  If they say yes, score, you'll have a job to come back to if it turns out that travelling isn't for you.  If they say no, fuck it, quit and find something new when you get back.  (Travelling has to be at least a little bit about irresponsibility :) )   
Pick somewhere that isn't tooooo far away from the USA, culturally, for your first trip.  If you've never left your town before and you fly into Mumbai you're going to shit yourself (probably literally after a few meals haha) and want to come home.   Europe is much more expensive than asia, obviously, but at least it's more culturally close to the states.  Then again, maybe I'm under estimating you... it's just something to consider.     
You could also look into some kind of ""program"" so you're not completely on your own on the other side of the world.  There are heaps of programs to do with volunteering abroad.  You can teach English after a short course.  Google TEFL (teaching english as a foreign language) for information on that.  Or you could do something like building orphanages or conservation work if you're more into the physical labour.  Volunteering abroad can be expensive... but it's for a good cause so you can try writing to companies asking them to sponsor you, or have sponsored fund raisers?    
About working in Paris/europe in general... unless you want to do it illegally, you will run into a lot of problems with visas.  Also, I have a sneaking suspicion you'll quickly discover that working long hours in a totally shitty job in Paris, is no more exciting than working your current job in the states.  I notice you mentioned IT skills... is there anything you could do to be working remotely?  You have to go absolute miles out of your way to find somewhere that doesn't have internet these days.  If there's a bus stop, there's an internet café (it might be sharing 56k between 8 computers... but it's something) so if you can wangle a telecommuting job somehow, you can live the dream.    
You could also try www.bunac.org, who organise work abroad programs and will help you with visas.  There are restrictions for some countries (like needing to be a student) but countries such as Australia are fairly easy to get visas for.   
Lastly... just cause you mentioned this in your post - DON'T let language barriers be a reason not to go travelling.  Pretty much everywhere has some people that speak English.  DO make an effort though, learn the basics like hello, goodbye, thank you, please, how much etc for anywhere you go because people will appreciate it.    
edit: Oh also, it's funny you talk about hovering over the ""book flight"" button.  I've always found that my trips have come from a decision to book the flight, rather than a decision to actually go.  There's a subtle difference but I tend to find myself thinking ""sod it'll just book it"" rather than ""sod it i'll just go"" and then, once you've booked it, you have to go.  :D

The point of Black History Month is to illustrate the contributions that Black people have made in history (usually focusing on American history) so that they don't feel lost in the sauce, or that they don't feel that no one who's like them has ever accomplished anything worth noting.

It's kind of like the fact that if someone says ""classical music"", one almost automatically thinks of European music.  A child learning under this curriculum can have the concept that no one else has made contributions to music or that the only ""worthy"" music is Eurocentric music if care is not taken to demonstrate the value of other types.  Black History Month is an attempt to address this issue by having intent focus on the accomplishments of Black people.  I do agree that it ought not be limited to one month of the year, but as things stand in American primary schools, it's better than the former alternative, which was pretty much ""all history is white history.""  White supremacy is ingrained in the American educational system, and thusly is ingrained in all children enrolled in our schools, regardless of color.

The ideal situation would be to give equal consideration to people of all ethnicities and background when teaching history and of course there would then be no need for Black History Month.  But I can't agree with a few of the sentiments here that BHM is stupid or racist.  It's an attempt to correct a problem and it should be respected for what it is.

Your faith in government maybe needs a rethink.. if only because of the that robust systems develop through challenge. If you just blindly accept government reasoning without question then they might well become soft in the head, even if they aren't already.

Rich is a relative term and maybe we'd be better off not chasing the mighty $. If Government weren't so strongly taken with the US approach, wishing the UK as the 51st state, maybe our banks wouldn't have trusted the US so much.

The special relationship is well known, and the US defense spending is obvious enough. The argument you have to play along to participate maybe isn't a strong one. As you've suggested maybe they need us for access to European+ insight. If you behave weak you will be taken advantage of. Neither you or the UK government are clever enough to anticipate consequences.. you do things right and consequences follow, do them for the wrong reasons and life becomes more confused and troubled than needs be.

Losing American intelligence would be better than bending over each time they want their way with us. Maybe they might take a moment to reconsider their stupidity before actioning such a bold step? Maybe even if they didn't we'd be better off.. we don't need friends like that. Being complicit in actions that are misguided/unethical etc isn't worth the upside.

&gt; How much money do we pay in taxes?

If you are the top income bracket, the rate is 35%.  Thirty years ago it was 79%.  And In the 40's it was 90+%.  Glorious Hero Reagan changed that 79% to a 28%, and then raised spending. (**sidenote**: this is a good fact to know.  the conservative mantra of ""cut taxes"" may have made sense when you make an incredible 51% drop in taxes ([and there was less mandatory funding needed to be funded](http://www.facingup.org/why-it-matters/facts-figures)), but dropping taxes a few points will do virtually nothing).

I hate taxes as much as the next guy, but we have to be honest with ourselves.  Until something is done with the obscene defense spending, 35% tax rate may not fund everything we need or want.  Not when you're fighting two wars anyways.

Because the criteria under which bonus schemes are granted, have eroded due to the fierce competiton for high talent and their represented clientele (as in the financial industry), to such levels, that fiscal year's end results don't matter anymore so much. So we reached a situation in which self-centered values of generations of high talent have been validated by not only corporations but a whole industry. And this needs to change.

The reasons are generally quite obvious. Since killing 12 million people, among which 70% of a certain ""racial-religious"" group is so reprehensible, they cannot defend this so they must prove it never happened. This way they won't feel bad glorifying nazis and being antisemites. You will not find a single Holocaust denier (or ""seeker of the truth"" as they like to call themselves) who isn't in some way related to Neofascism or Neonazism.

They will usually claim the Holocaust as ""defined by the Jews"" didn't happen. That is, they ignore the 6 million non-Jew victims and only claim there were no 6 million Jewish deaths. They're just fine with the Nazis killing POWs, political opponents, blacks, gays, criminals, handicapped, Roma, Sinti, Slavs, etc. It's only about the Jews.

Thus, they will claim the ""Holocaust"" never took place because the victims weren't all burned (holocaust means fire-sacrifice), that only 2 million were killed, no traces of gas were found, there were more Jews after the war than before, it is all a MSM complot, et cetera.

Denialists simply ignore the tremendous amount of proof, from photographs to official documents to oral testiments. They will cling to a single ""proof"" which in their mind discredits everything else. You can compare them to Creationists who think the lack of ""transitional"" fossils, or some nonsense like that, totally discredits all other proof of evolution. Indeed, you could say Holocaust Denialism is simply one of the many streams of a larger anti-scientific movement kept alive by the David Irvings, Alex Joneses, Pat Robertsons and others who profit from it.

Btw, if Neonazis, Neofascists or other scum are coming to your town, you *can* deal with them. If there's any local antifa group, contact them and ask them if you can help. If there isn't, here's a simple 3 step plan:

**-Step 1-**

Find out everything about the racist demonstration. Reduce the info to a short talk you can give that is understandable by anyone.

**-Step 2-**

Find people who would love to beat up racists.:

* Hooligans always love a fight and many will loathe racists. 

* Teens/youths from tightly knit communities are awesome too, one Moroccan guy calls his friends and cousins and they call their friends and cousins: Bam, you have a 100 pairs of fists. 

* Local martial arts clubs will have people interested too, especially if they're ""exotic"" martial arts (like penchak silat).

* Other groups of ethnic minorities. Blacks, SE Asians, Eastern Europeans. They love not being the victim for once.

* Whomever else you can think of. Everyone hates racists but themselves.

**-Step 3-**

A republic is just a representative democracy.

When people vote for representatives, it is similar - they choose someone who will hopefully make decisions similar to what they themselves would choose - still those decisions are general decisions, and the elected representatives, be they presidents or governors, don't micromanage everything in their administrations.  The same is true of direct democracies - if voters vote for pizza, that doesn't mean they are going to have to determine how much tomato sauce to put on each pizza - the chef will decide that - but the chef wouldn't have the authority to give them noodles instead.

Only then, will both Democrats and Republicans be open to trying new ideas.  This will have to incorporate several predictable things:  default on the US national debt, resulting in an end to most international trade, other than commodity swaps, for at least a decade; the rebuilding of America's industrial infrastructure that had been outsourced for years; and the provision of housing and food for the unemployed, between 30-50% of our workforce.

We are in uncharted waters; I've looked back at your older comments and while I agree with you that there are more parallels to the late 19th-century depressions and panics than the early 20th-century Great Depression, we're still looking at an entirely unknown beastie. There has been a qualitative *and* quantitative change in the velocity of information now that simply didn't exist back then, not to speak of the global scope and depth of the economic structures.

&gt; This will have to incorporate several predictable things: default on the US national debt...

Ah, but what happens when our economic partner nations who are as asymmetrically geared for an export model as an unsustainable path to economic growth as we are to a consumption model are racing us to the devaluation bottom? Nevertheless, put options on way out of the money 10-years are pretty tempting right now for me.

&gt; ...other than commodity swaps, for at least a decade...

There's likely a giant pile of value to be made here, if correlation doesn't destabilize so much it wipes out the trading exchanges. If the kind of currency destabilization we both expect comes to pass, there are going to be some very, very complex interlinked swaps set up between commodities, interest rates, and currencies. If the deals are big enough, maybe even equity and credit swaps. Do you participate in these swap markets?

&gt; ... the rebuilding of America's industrial infrastructure that had been outsourced for years...

I don't see that happening quickly unless something like your idea of floating million and hundred million dollar notes to support specific companies is enacted. Obama's economic team so far looks like they will try their damnedest to follow Bernanke's PhD dissertation script's prescription: more growth, more debt issuance.

&gt; ...between 30-50% of our workforce...

For for January 2009, U-6 unemployment (commonly accepted by many observers and commentators as closest to how unemployment was measured during the Great Depression), stands at a raw 15.4%, and I'm willing to bet the seasonally adjusted value will be right there. Basically you're telling people out there: look around you at work, at best half again of you will be laid off in a year or two, and possibly as many as two-thirds. That's why I'm putting in for some short positions, and buttoning up my business to experience a to-the-floor drop in sales this year (frankly surprised it hasn't happened  yet). What I suspect might happen this time around is while agricultural output will be fine and we won't see *Grapes of Wrath*-style starvation due to supply issues, we'll turn into a giant version of Cuba as all sorts of imported goods go into this constant state of patching and repairing as buying new (or even used) becomes prohibitively expensive. Where we will see starvation is due to distribution issues, your ""everyone only has nickels, but food costs $100"" scenario.

&gt; Internationally, at some point the US will be joined by sovereign wealth collapses in dozens of nations. Perhaps half of the European nations, and many of the Asian nations will be effectively bankrupt.

I think your idea of a currency split is interesting, but possibly unlikely to happen because as corrupt, economically naive and venal as our branches of government are at the Federal level, I wouldn't put it past them to issue a simple decree that all electronic specie denominated in dollars are also legal tender. Instant hyperinflation as people start liquidating dollar-denominated accounts, but a welcome (if short-term) palliative from Bernanke's and Geithner's perspective trying to battle deflation. Now, if instead of electronic money you talked about trade credit, I would be in total agreement that your split might happen with trade credit. And my wife and I are terrified enough of the potential consequences that we have already spoken with attorneys and accountants about moving our affairs offshore, in preparation to remove our physical selves offshore as well. Hopefully, I'm wrong and we end up with a nice vacation home at the other side of this awful mess. I can handle business cycle downturns, even severe ones, but wholesale destruction of trading networks (one of the main criteria I believe for actual collapses accompanied by technological level regression) gives me the willies. I sure hope those swap exchanges hold up, we're sure going to need them.

From [The Times](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/world_agenda/article5598209.ece):

&gt;For 13 years Mr Oddsson was Prime Minister and from 1991 he set about making Iceland wealthy. He did more than anybody to transform the island, give it some global clout. And he did so with the familiar tools: deregulation, rapid privatisation, central bank independence, the fight against inflation. 

Here's Oddsson in 2004 bragging about how he [slashed corporate tax rates](http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.20743,filter.all/pub_detail.asp):

&gt;The Icelandic Treasury is in a solid position and Iceland's international credit rating has never been better. This success has been achieved not in spite of extensive tax cuts but, to a great degree, because of them. In the early nineteen-nineties, corporate income tax was 50 percent. The Government cut it first to 30 percent and later to 18 percent, and Treasury revenues and economic growth actually increased as a result.

[And now](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/iceland/4540835/Iceland-downfall-of-a-foolish-little-nation.html)?

&gt;The words ""failed state"" bring to mind ungovernable Third World hell-holes, but Iceland is a new kind of failed state, a financially failed one. Without cash from the International Monetary Fund it would be as near to bankrupt as a country can be...

&gt;Repayments went through the roof and the overheated housing market collapsed. Unemployment soared towards 10 per cent. The construction industry seized up...

&gt;Now, interest rates are 18 per cent and inflation 20 per cent; and each man, woman and child could owe as much as $250,000 to foreign creditors.

Oddsson, now chairing the Central Bank's board of governors, is of course defiant and [refusing to step down](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=aQwPxa2Edig8), even after the government led by his [protégé](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/world_agenda/article5598209.ece) [collapsed](http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/01/26/iceland.government/index.html).

They honestly can't afford it.

Though, it'd be more difficult for them, but given the number of jews we're talking... no sane person could expect them to accomodate it.

And it's unlikely that the jews would allow themselves to be parceled up and farmed out to various EU members either. (Though, it's doubtful the EU would agree even to that.)

&gt; And don't forget there are already half a million Jews in Argentina. They seem to be safe and welcome there.

Yes, they are. And Argentina might even be ok with it, as long as 500,000 doesn't become 12 million. (Or whatever the official number is.)

I agree, in principle, though I see no reason to make distinctions between different types of impossible.

I think there is a large chunk of Americans (and Europeans for that matter) who call themselves Catholics, but don't go to church very often, and don't take the dogma very seriously. If you are an Anti-theist, who wants to  introduce doubt to said Catholics, this Priest is a godsend.

If we could get this priest in front of them, somehow made him famous enough that many on-the-fence type Catholics would have to hear the tenets of their faith exposed,  that might be fantastic.

In some ways this Priest is much more powerful than Dawkins' Buses, because his message is targeted to a specific group of turnable Theists. Let him spew his insanity, and then ask: This is one of your church's most studied priests, expressing what your faith holds to be gospel, and, I mean, you can tell it is clearly insane, right? ...

I worked for a small telephone company, specializing in discount international calling cards (the no-brand ones you buy from Abu at the local corner store; though they also has commercial, residential and wholesale revenue streams). We used A, B, C and D for all kinds of stupid crap that isn't priority related.

Anyways, one of the incredibly stupid things they did was assign 'D' to mean: ""Call NOC"". The idea was that field techs could use their portable to call in to the NOC from any customer location without having to remember the number (the portables used by field techs had 0-9 and A-D). This was only needed in a pinch obviously (it is very rare for a field tech to need to talk to the NOC directly).

Anyway, one of the customers had attached a very old AT&amp;T touch-tone phone to the network with the A, B, C, and D buttons. Somehow the customer realized what ""D"" did. Now we're a pretty competitive company, but we had pretty limited switching technology (basically just a Veraz soft switch). The Veraz couldn't do least-cost-routing out of the box. Instead, during peak hours, the NOC would call around to various carriers in real-time and try to negotiate the cheapest rates.

Picture a three-guy trading floor. They would call a carrier, negotiate a price and QOS guarantee, watch the call supervision monitors very closely to check for QOS issues on a trunk, and based on QOS and pricing, manually move trunks in and out of route by issuing SQL commands against the Veraz's Oracle database.

This is a high-stress, yelling into your phone while pacing in your cubical late at night typing commands as fast as your fingers can move job. This is the kind of job where missing a call can cost the company millions. And its just you and two other guys alone all night long. Generally the work is divided up: one guy makes the calls, another guy runs and analyzes CSM/ASR reports, while the other enters commands into the Veraz database to maintain the carrier trunk routing tables.

Now, this smart-ass customer, decides to mess around with his new-found-toy during our busiest night of the year (Sunday night between 7p-1a EST the week before thanksgiving). This ass-hat calls the NOC over and over and over all night long. I mean, literally D-hangup-D-hangup-D-hangup. It was so bad that the NOC couldn't even make an outgoing call half the time and answering incoming calls from carriers was useless (you'd just get hung up on).

Now, this sounds really funny right? Well this was a cut-throat telecom start-up during the dotcom bubble burst, and this was the most lucrative night of the year. In fact, this one night makes or breaks the entire year. Tens-of-millions of dollars worth of calls are routed through this network during this one shift.

On top of that, there are regulatory issues related to QOS minimums that must be met. This means that calls to Haiti have to have an answer supervision rate of at least 84%, calls to Canada have to have guaranteed routing (e.g. we can't give callers in the US ""No circuits"" messages unless there really isn't any (calls the Mexico are often dropped with ""No circuits"" when we just can't find a trunk cheap enough to make money on the call). The cost of regulatory violations can be VERY hefty. There are per-incident fines in the thousands in some cases. With a million calls are made in one night, the potential for disaster is quite real.

Anyway, while this ass hat was DOS-ing the NOC, a few things happened. First, Telecom Italia decides, ""fuck it, calls to Mexico City now cost 0.0023 cents per minute to terminate instead of 0.0019"" (or whatever). Basically a price hike that normally gets a carrier taken out of route entirely (or at least we call them and negotiate a cheaper price based on some trade-of-traffic deal or something). Unfortunately, we miss the call warning of the price change. So now 15% of our calls are being terminated way over the expected price. Then, NovaTel looses a fiber trunk to Europe, and has to move all traffic through a backup trunk. But we miss those calls and suddenly we loose half the world. The ASR report takes about 2 minutes to propagate the data telling the guys what just happened because the damn thing is a PHP app that queries a MySQL server which is asynchronously populated by a cron job written in perl that is so fucking slow its unbelievable. So for two minutes the NOC has no idea that we just committed an international trade violation and lost a couple million dollars in revenue. And best of all, they have no idea what trunk NovaTel has switched traffic to. So the NOC panics and switches all of Europe over to a VERY expensive Qwest trunk (knowingly but reluctantly).

In the meantime, one of the guys, no shit, got in his car, drove across Ft Lauderdale to the office in Hollywood, took and elevator to the 15th floor, to look up his supervisors number and call him. The guy literally didn't know his supervisors phone number. Now, you'd think while he was there, he'd be bright enough to make some calls to some European carriers at least. But this guys decides its best just to go back down to his car, drive across Ft Lauderdale again back to the NOC. Meanwhile, it takes his supervisor more than two hours to get ready and drive from fucking Naples, on the other side of the state.

Now, remember the 0.0023 that Telecom Italia is charging? Funny thing happens when you leave a trunk on the top of the routing list to a major destination too long without answering their warning calls. They exploited to opportunity to go ahead and make another increase, this time to 0.0064 or some-such price that is ridiculously high. Qwest charges less than a quarter that to terminate a call across an ocean.

So two hours goes by before the sup shows up. By now, this has been doing on for half the shift (4 hours or so). The D-hangup-D-hangups are still going on. Probably automated. The sup opens a console to the Veraz's Oracle database, and issues one query:

DELETE FROM TRUNK_CLLI_ROUTE WHERE DEST_LATA LIKE 'D%';

LOL! Calls stopped immediately. The four of them called every carrier to get status and cost updates. The damage was totaled up in MS Excel by the sup (who was the CTO) and emailed out to all of IT by morning as an FYI. We had to make 5M that night to break even for the year (we were already in the red). We expected to make closer to 50M. We actually made about -30M. Let me write that out for you: One ass-hat residential customer with a 20yo telephone with four extra buttons did thirty million dollars in damages in less than one night.

Anyways, that's how the company went bankrupt in late 2001 and about 6000 or so people in the Ft Lauderdale area all got laid off. :(",1234188013,120,120,t5_2fwo,rlee0001

The frustrating thing is two-fold. First, growing cities from slums is so fucking slow. Second, it's so damned inefficient to build up an area BEFORE you have to dig it all up for utilities, trams and subways.

Third, there's [Haussman's renovation of Paris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haussmann%27s_renovation_of_Paris) to consider, even if it did result in a gentrified horizontally socially-segregated more easily controlled and militarized city core.

The American fear of everything with the prefix ""social"" is just an echo from 50s communist paranoia. Socialism and communism is no threat to the free countries of the western world anymore, seriously, have they worked anywhere? at any time? 

The free market has shown itself superior time after time, when we get a cris, we call it a stock-crash and everything regulates itself after å few year. When statist and rigid countries have crisis, they cause revolts and great sufferings. 

The free market og democracy is the economic and political version of darwinism, its a self-regulating mechanism. Communism is like Intelligent design ;-) in every way, instead of letting society align itself based on needs and peoples own desire, the leaders try to design the optimal solution. The result? Historically, not very good.

That being said, there are plenty of European social programs that have proven themselves successful, and a couple of them, the verdict is not still out, but if you do not dare testing different approches within the frame of the free market, your society will surely not improve.

I am for small-goverment, and I would rather have a goverment that has a wide role in its responsibility and caring of its citizen, but stays small, rather than a big goverment that does not deliver any social programs.

Sometimes I feel the US-govement is the worst of two worlds in this respect. Its big, and yet it delivers little value to its citizens. And it seems that your welfare programs do little more than keep people in welfare programs.

Well, smallpaul... that little bit you're replying to is the synthesis of a realization that has come to me recently. I've seen that I have encountered serious problems because of this attitude I see in the usa. The things on that list up there are very specific elements which are aspects of this derision and rancor directed at people with big words and novel ideas.

I've been following Paul Graham's social commentary essays on his site for a couple of years now, and I also watch how they are received on reddit - he always gets flak. He's called every name in the book. I've seen this same social effect directed towards me and towards young college-age friends of mine who have a philosophical bent. I'm wondering if this essay represents a soul searching process for Graham... He has come to realize that his essays are not appreciated by most people... and he's trying to figure out why. So he goes and looks at the topics of discussion which get folks' feathers ruffled the most in the usa. He's come to the conclusion that it has to do with folks' identity; and that's fascinating food for thought. But I think that his conclusion is somewhat in error.

Different folks throughout history have talked about this effect. Plato had a story which has become quite renowned and is now known as the ""[allegory of the cave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave)."" Now frankly, smallpaul, to be a person who relishes thinking deeply and independently about things and to be living in a society which is scared of new ideas, and which derides people who talk about them - it's very much a burden. My own brother gets all upset when I talk about all of my different and unique perspectives on things. He tells me things like, ""it's going to hurt our friendship if we keep discussing this.""  There's a reason why the [TED conference](http://www.ted.com/index.php) requires that potential conference attendees illustrate something of their respect for the project, before their application is accepted.

Over the past couple of years, I've been researching other countries where I might want to emigrate to.

 I spent several months following Canadian events with the CBC, CTV, the globe and mail, and other canadian media. I was really impressed with Canada - because of how rationally your news media covers things up there. It's a refreshing change from the hyperbolic emotionalism with which the news media in the usa covers things. And I kind of thought that it would be easier in Canada for a deep thinking individual. But I'm getting disillusioned with how sad people seem to be up there in the wintertime. And I've actually come to the conclusion that the tenor in which the news media (for instance, the CBC) discusses events gets people depressed.  

Recently, I've started researching New Zealand with [radio new zealand](http://www.radionz.co.nz/), and [Tv3's internet video offerings](http://www.3news.co.nz/Video/3NewsLiveStream/tabid/387/Default.aspx). There I see a society which really does hold the same values which I always have, and where people really do enjoy thinking about things deeply. 

OK, now on to reply to what you have said:

&gt; That all said, the quality of a society is not really something that one can measure or debate. It is ultimately just an emotion which one uses facts to validate. The question is: where does the emotion really come from?

There are specific qualities of society which one can measure and compare with other societies. On the other hand, you can't measure the zeitgeist of that country as a whole very easily. That much is true.


You tell me:

&gt; You are the fish and you think you see the water clearly...but what you actually see is your own preconceptions reflected back at you and reinforced by selective fact picking and contextualizing.

My first posts in conversations at places like reddit are often designed to make a splash. I want to challenge people's way of thinking about things - and so I write my prose in a way that's going to get a reaction from folks.  That means a conversation can take place... and I am given more space to explain the details of what I'm talking about. As far as my cultural background goes: My family has many ties with Asia. My father grew up over there as a boy, and then went back to a different asian country with my mother before I was born and adopted two of my older siblings from there. I myself was a foreign exchange student in europe in highschool. And I've lived decades in the usa. I'm not a fish looking out of a fishbowl. I have enough experience to be able to understand these social effects I'm talking about.


And finally this little doozy...

&gt; Furthermore, you fit the stereotype of the anti-American pseudo-intellectual. 

That's a pretty mean spirited statement, smallpaul. What constitutes a pseudo-intellectual? A person who thinks independently about things, like Paul Graham, and Nicholas Negroponte? A person who sets aside cultural preconceptions (what used to be called ""prejudices"" by the philosophers)? That's the very attitude which I am calling out when I refer to ""anti-intellectualism."" When you see something that doesn't fit in the narratives you have for yourself about the world - all you see is gibberish, and you call the person who writes that way a ""pseudo-intellectual."" Oftentimes, those who consider themselves the staunchest fans of academia are those who don't understand how to critically assess a person's reasoning process... or a scientist's methodology when she or he is conducting an experiment.  They don't understand the importance of what academics from hundreds of years ago talked about when they spoke about ""metaphysics.""",1234206207,1,1,t5_2fwo,otterplay

In 1990 I received my green card and have been living in the United States since.  Shortly after meeting my husband in 1994 we moved to a wonderfully beautiful neighborhood in Cupertino and have been here since.  We holiday with my family back home and while it is always enjoyable to be back home, I absolutely love living in the Bay Area and would not trade it for the world.  I love this city and the center of research, higher learning, cultural diversity, art, and free-thought that it encompasses.

I currently teach at a local community college and my husband works for the county as an environmental planner but we also started and eventually sold an environmental consulting firm.  One of the biggest benefits I have experienced living here has been the upward mobility offered.  I came from a middle to slightly lower middle class family just outside of Stockholm and while we were comfortable, there was little opportunity for my father to change careers or save much money.  I am progressive and believe that the US should have universal health care, yet I believe that one of the biggest problems with some countries in western Europe is the very high tax rate as well as the large VAT, and property taxes.  The tax revenue is important in preventing people from living in poverty, but it has it's draw backs and making a better life for yourself is difficult. 

We have a word in our culture, ""Lagom"".  It describes an ideal way in which to live and basically means: sufficient, or average, or just enough.  It's a noble part of the Swedish cultural identity, however, it exemplifies one of the fundamental boundaries in trying to make more for yourself or your family.  I can't say it is wrong outlook in life, but I wanted more, and so I came to the United States and this country has given me that opportunity.  Granted, the United States has it's problems - but I am grateful for having had the chance to decide what I wanted on my own terms. That said, I wish you the best in finding happiness for yourself.  I think that people who want to come to US and make something for themselves should have the opportunity just as you should have the opportunity to leave.

Not only is it more expensive, but the sheer waste and habit of cheating customers out of their benefits until the companies have to be sued is immoral, too.  A government department doesn't have the same profit motive to try to cheat people out of benefits, and so they tend to serve people a lot better in that regard.

Then there's the problem if high barrier cost of entry to many of the industries you're discussing.  Think about the investment required to start up a water company, it's prohibitive.  You end up with a de-facto monopoly, where one company can raise the price (water, electric, fire service, etc) way beyond what it costs and still be below a profit incentive point sufficient to make it worth the while of a second company to enter the market to compete.

The libertarian kool-aid would have you believe that private corporations are always more efficient than governments, but reality isn't a theoretical free market model.  There are good reasons for why some industries have come to be public services over time in virtually all areas of the world, a truly overwhelming precedent in a vast number of dramatically different societies and cultures.  

As for moving power to states, that doesn't solve the problem you complained about, with your elected representatives doing things you don't like.  They'd just be state representatives instead.  

Without any government at all you wind up in a state of nature; marauding warlords like those in the dark age periods of Europe, the warring states periods of China or Japan, or modern day Somalia, Congo, Sri Lanka, and even the drug lord slums and provinces of Brazil and Columbia.  They operate in armed, organized and totally ruthless bands more than capable of overwhelming any local militia and then raping their wives and recruiting their children after slaughtering the militia members.

The economics of a non-governmental situation are similarly depressing.  The gap between the haves and the have-nots widens even more dramatically than a situation with no income tax or labor regulation.  It's just a bad scene.

This is why it was always important that all the states within the union were legislatively distinct.  Now we have more than a century of federal encroach.

I'm not very familiar with the organization, so I'm not going to pretend I know much about it, but we're talking the difference between a local private security firm situated in the US, and a 'private' security firm that, according to Wikipedia, *at least 90 percent of the company's revenue comes from government contracts, of which two-thirds are no-bid contracts.* It's essentially a government supported monopoly.

Also, you know as well as I do that the overall approval ratings of police departments nationwide are pretty low -- cops harassing people, cops breaking the laws they're meant to enforce, excessive force, abuse, inefficiency, etc. Just look at the crime rates in the big cities. Horrendous!

&gt; A government department doesn't have the same profit motive to try to cheat people out of benefits, and so they tend to serve people a lot better in that regard.

Actually, the profit motive is exactly what makes the private sector so much better. The government will always get it's money, no matter what. There's no incentive to be as efficient or as inexpensive, or to provide the best service possible. It's like the car insurance industry -- how many different companies do you have fighting for your business? Geico is not going to start charging a lot more money than Allstate for the same service, or start treating it's customers poorly; otherwise all the Geico customers will go to Allstate. Same with the health insurance agencies -- which are heavily regulated by the government, by the way.

Just think -- it costs less than a dollar for hundreds of products we use every day. Why shouldn't it be the same for /anything/ the private sector does? I think if you look deeply, you'll find that government has way too much control over everything, and I think that's what causes a lot of the 'greed' of the private sector that people often claim is the problem. 

&gt; Then there's the problem if high barrier cost of entry to many of the industries you're discussing.

I don't agree with that. In fact, with government, we already experience such situations -- think Comcast for TV, AT&amp;T for telephone, Verizon for cell phones, Microsoft for operating systems, your local city's water department, your region's big electric company, etc. The government imposes a crapload of regulations on pretty much every aspect of our life and the private sector; many of those regulations help the big guys stay big and make it way too difficult/cost prohibitive for the little guys to gain foothold.

&gt; Without any government at all you wind up in a state of nature; marauding warlords like those in the dark age periods of Europe

No there wouldn't be! For one, government has 'murdered' (mostly indirectly, at least in our case) millions of citizens as it is; even ours (think unnecessary wars, or wars caused by our foreign policies; think the draft; think SWAT/FBI, etc). Second, why would that happen? People naturally want order. The free market (a true free market, not a phoney ""free"" market like we have today) would provide that order. Maybe a few hundred years ago, with people unaware of the true dangers of the world, a stateless society might suffer this fate. But we're all too smart to let it happen now. There's no reason we would.

&gt; The gap between the haves and the have-nots widens even more dramatically than a situation with no income tax or labor regulation. It's just a bad scene.

Well, consider the fact that, through taxation, the government takes away $2.7 trillion of the peoples' money each year. $1.2 of that comes from peoples' income. That's just the federal government alone! How much more economically sound would we be without taxation? How much more prosperous if we could keep 100% of what we earned?

Upon successful completion of lower division courses a student can transfer directly to a large public university which is what my husband did when he transferred to UCLA.

I would argue that higher education in US is quite good.  My friends and family in europe are amazed by this system.  In many european countries, University education and admission costs are very highly subsidized by taxes, much more so than in this country.  There are of course a limited number of openings for collegiate study and so if a student does not qualify for entrance then they don't have any other options.  From a very young age, tests are conducted that decide if a child will enter the university or a trade school.  A test you take at age 13 will decide if you become a doctor or end up studying hospitality and become a waiter.  It is a meritocracy which on one hand is a great thing, but on the other hand if you don't do well, then the state has a say in what you end up being educated in and as a result what you end up doing for a living.

It didn't really get into full swing until the 20th century, and prior to about 1850 even the biggest, most intrusive governments were laissez faire by modern standards.

Consider this: in 1900 you could travel clear across Europe as far as the Russian border without any form of identification.

Even the most despotic European kings had a hard time extracting more than 10-15% of their nation's output, because they lacked modern central banking and mass media.  

Or consider that private banks existed in Europe for over 600 years before states started trying to control and regulate them.  Stock markets are almost as old.  

Or consider that European warfare prior to the advent of mass media consisted mostly of trying to keep your conscripts from running away.  Most common people did not self-identify with their states, and rightly viewed squabbles between kings as ""not my problem"".  

My point is that from the Enlightenment to World War I, Europe rode an incredible upward curve in terms of wealth, education, technology, and liberty.  During this time, modern states as we know them did not exist.  Of course it was not perfect.  Progress is never a straight line.  But the overall trend is undeniable, and it's what our entire present civilization is built upon.

Modern states brought us warfare, taxation, and control on a scale never seen prior to last century.  Culture changes slowly, so the full repercussions of this shift are still being felt.  ",1234220096,6,6,t5_2cneq,ef4

It was a small class, with about 12 students, and we would read something and discuss it. One of our first books was ""Maus,"" a graphic novel about the Holocaust (with the characters drawn as mice.) I am quite vocal, and I got into a 11 versus 1 argument (the student teacher joined against me, and one student sat the fence) when everyone agreed that it was just fine for countries in Europe to make questioning the Holocaust a crime.

I went home extremely upset and disillusioned. A few weeks later, we did some reading tangentially related to the Armenian massacre. One of the first things the TA asked was whether any of us had heard of the Armenian Massacre; only I and the kid who had previously abstained raised our hands. The professor went on to explain what happened. We were about to move on to discuss the story when I interrupted to ask if students thought it should be illegal to deny that the Armenian Massacre happened. Most people looked a little less certain, but but still overwhelmingly agreed that yes, it should be illegal also.

I said I am not afraid to express my opinion, but I usually refrain from prosetyling or lecturing-- usually I am uncertain of myself, and though I express my opinion, I am mostly probing to see what other people think. But I was so upset at what people were apparently so blind to that I took the opportunity to give a little speech, pointing out that NONE OF YOU had even HEARD of this event until today, and that ONE student teacher, who incidentally had a not-quite-placeable Europeanish accent (for all I know, she could have been Armenian, as I pointed out), told us it happened-- and just like that, 5 minutes later, we were in favor of making it illegal to even question the matter.

Josh Gordon, The Age (Melbourne), September 7, 2008

AUSTRALIA has been singled out as a target for “forest jihad” by a group of Islamic extremists urging Muslims to deliberately light bushfires as a weapon of terror.

US intelligence channels earlier this year identified a website calling on Muslims in Australia, the US, Europe and Russia to “start forest fires”, claiming “scholars have justified chopping down and burning the infidels’ forests when they do the same to our lands”.

The website, posted by a group called the Al-Ikhlas Islamic Network, argues in Arabic that lighting fires is an effective form of terrorism justified in Islamic law under the “eye for an eye” doctrine.

The posting—which instructs jihadis to remember “forest jihad” in summer months—says fires cause economic damage and pollution, tie up security agencies and can take months to extinguish so that “this terror will haunt them for an extended period of time”.

“Imagine if, after all the losses caused by such an event, a jihadist organisation were to claim responsibility for the forest fires,” the website says. “You can hardly begin to imagine the level of fear that would take hold of people in the United States, in Europe, in Russia and in Australia.”

With the nation heading into another hot, dry summer, Australian intelligence agencies are treating the possibility that bushfires could be used as a weapon of terrorism as a serious concern.

Attorney-General Robert McClelland said the Federal Government remained “vigilant against such threats”, warning that anyone caught lighting a fire as a weapon of terror would feel the wrath of anti-terror laws.

“Any information that suggests a threat to Australia’s interests is investigated by relevant agencies as appropriate,” Mr McClelland said.

Adam Dolnik, director of research at the University of Wollongong’s Centre for Transnational Crime Prevention, said that bushfires (unlike suicide bombing) were generally not considered a glorious type of attack by jihadis, in keeping with a recent decline in the sophistication of terrorist operations.

“With attacks like bushfires, yes, it would be easy. It would be very damaging and we do see a decreasing sophistication as a part of terrorist attacks,” Dr Dolnik said.

“In recent years, there have been quite a few attacks averted and it has become more and more difficult for groups to do something effective.”

Dr Dolnik said he had observed an increase in traffic on jihadi websites calling for a simplification of terrorist attacks because the more complex operations had been failing. But starting bushfires was still often regarded as less effective than other operations because governments could easily deny terrorism as the cause.

The internet posting by the little-known group claimed the idea of forest fires had been attributed to imprisoned Al Qaeda leader Abu Musab Al-Suri. It said Al-Suri had urged terrorists to use sulphuric acid and petrol to start forest fires.

&gt; Obviously not all religions can be true because they have different and even conflicting stories

Each of us has a very limited experience of our universe.  The classic analogy is two blind men examining an elephant, one at its head and one at its tail.  The two blind men might have very different descriptions of an elephant, indeed, those descriptions might even be contradictory.

If you consider mythology as humanity's attempt to understand the world around it, then it is not so hard to see both the Wind Spirit of the Bear and the Angels of a Christian God as representing truth.

&gt; We, the American people were attacked by a radical group of Muslims who believe that we are barbaric. Their reasons for this were religion based.  We, the US, broadcast obscene music videos, promote gay rights, and allow woman to come out in public, wear what they would like to, and exercise voting rights.

Really?  Why didn't they attack Europe, which is more pro-gay, more tolerant of obscenity on TV, etc?  Bin Laden himself explained why they did it: to protest US military bases in Saudi Arabia and our support of Israel.  That they did it because ""they hate our way of life"" is propaganda crap Bush spoon fed his simpleton followers.

Tell me, why did they attack our financial center instead of a religious target, like the Vatican?  It wasn't about religion, it was about America's tampering with Middle Eastern affairs.  You really seem way too bright to buy into Rovian rhetoric for the redneck masses.

Dreams are often attainable. I do tend toward the small government / low taxes side of things, but I really think the attitude in America has more to do with America's success than its economics.

The willingness to chase dreams and a culture that tolerates or even encourages this is why Hollywood, Silicon Valley, and Manhattan are all in America. It's why so many new technologies, new forms of music, new styles of art, and so on are invented here.

I think if you could somehow import this attitude over to Europe, the EU could easily eclipse America in spite of its heavy tax burden.

You even see this effect within America. Really, the America of innovation and invention and entrepreneurship is the east and west coasts and a few islands in the interior. The rest of America is religious, conservative, superstitious, and fatalist. The so-called ""red states"" often (though not always!) have lower taxes and less regulation than the coasts, but the attitude is so toxic to creativity and entrepreneurship that they stagnate.

I think the explanation is in the two sides of the Euro-style socialist coin.

On one hand, I think the income mobility is explained by the ready availability of great free education and infrastructure. If you want to better yourself, the means are handed to you. It's easy there to improve your earning potential.

On the other hand, the difficulty of actually accumulating wealth beyond a certain point is a pretty obvious side-effect of the progressive tax system. While you can increase your earning potential easily, the government just takes more and more of it.

So I stand by my original statement. There is a *glass ceiling* that it's very, very hard to move beyond. This has important social consequences: it means that while there might be easy class mobility up to middle class and some class mobility into upper-middle class, there is very little mobility up at the top where the air is thin. So you do have a caste system: you are either super-rich, or you are everyone else. The caste system is enforced by the tax system. If you're already rich, you can afford to pay high taxes. If you aren't, the taxes prevent you from ever getting there.

To some extent I view class mobility into the topmost brackets as the most important. Those are the brackets with the most influence, so if nobody ever gets there by their bootstraps it means new ideas never make it up there.

I also tend to view *any* kind of caste system as inherently offensive... almost to the extent of viewing its mere existence as a crime against humanity. I'd rather suffer the ups and downs of a more free market system with everyone else than live on a comfortable plantation... almost simply for the principle of the matter. The existence of a nobility is an offense against humanity.

From [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers)

&gt;On September 15, 2008, the firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The filing marked the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history.[2] The following day, the British bank Barclays announced its agreement to purchase, subject to regulatory approval, Lehman's North American investment-banking and trading divisions along with its New York headquarters building.[3][4] On September 20, 2008, a revised version of that agreement was approved by Judge James Peck.[5]

&gt;On September 22, 2008, Nomura Holdings announced that it had agreed to acquire Lehman Brothers' franchise in the Asia Pacific region, including Japan, Hong Kong and Australia.[6] The following day, Nomura announced its intention to acquire Lehman Brothers' investment banking and equities businesses in Europe and the Middle East. The deal became effective on Monday, 13 October.[7] In 2007, non-U.S. subsidiaries of Lehman Brothers were responsible for over 50% of global revenue produced.

....

&gt;On Saturday September 13, 2008, **Timothy F. Geithner**, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York called a meeting on the future of Lehman, which included the possibility of an emergency liquidation of its assets.[49] Lehman reported that it had been in talks with Bank of America and Barclays for the company's possible sale. However, both Barclays and Bank of America ultimately declined to purchase the entire company.[49][50]

&gt;The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) offered an exceptional trading session on Sunday, September 14, 2008, to allow market participants to offset positions in various derivatives on the condition of a Lehman bankruptcy later that day.[51][52] Although the bankruptcy filing missed the deadline, many dealers honored the trades they made in the special session.[53]

Failing to be recognised by the West, I'm sure you can understand, is a key issue in opening up Iran and enabling the reform (Khatami being very pro Europe wanting to use the EU trade laws as a template).

Then there's the fact that the Assembly of Experts, that keeps the other councils in check - and yes even has legislatory powers to hold the Supreme Leader accountable, has just had a little reform done to it its self.  Khatami ally Rafsanjani is now chairing.  

All that's already changed; plus the West is waking up to what a disaster the Bush doctrine and antagonist policy has been and that Israel has become a strategic burden as opposed to a cornerstone.

Then you can add to the melting pot that Khatami's support was stauch amongst the younger voters.

If you're an underdeveloped country, you'll find it quite impossible to develop while competing with existing giants. The best you can hope for is to ""win"" the race to the bottom.

This is not strictly true.  Developing nations have less infrastructure, to be certain, but generally also have a much lower cost of labor and living.

For example, if it weren't for US and EU farm subsidies, there is no way that produce grown in the developed world could compete with produce grown in the developing world.  The cost of labor and land in the west is simply too high.

Countries in Africa and Latin America could undercut us easily in these industries.  The result would be that people in the developed world would pay less for food, and, most importantly, poor people in the developing world would have jobs and a steady income.  This extra money would allow them to purchase other goods, increase stability, and generally increase the quality of life in those places.

The only people that benefit from farm subsidies are farmers, a tiny minority of the developed world's population.  They're subsidized by our tax dollars, so we pay more to buy their goods.  Poor people in Africa and elsewhere, who don't have the necessary infrastructure to become manufacturing centers in the model of China and Vietnam, and who are farming anyway, are robbed of one of their only growth avenues.

But our politicians would have us believe that if we don't maintain a farming industry, we'll starve if everyone in the world colludes and refuses to sell us food.  The likelihood of that is laughable but inducing paranoia is a good way to get votes.

Having said that, it's worth noting that most of the truly successful emerging markets today were at one point (or remain, to some extent) autocratically driven planned economies.  China, Vietnam, and the ex-Soviet states followed the communist model, and for all the limitations of that model they were left with an educated populace, a decent road and rail system, etc.  On the right wing, you have places like South Korea, Taiwan, and Brazil, that were military dictatorships until relatively recently, and also had their entire economies directed in a unilateral way.

Building a road to a small town can seem like a useless investment in market terms (an example in the US that might resonate with some people is laying high-speed internet lines to small rural towns).  There's no obvious short term gain, especially not for the person that builds the infrastructure in question.  What's my ROI if I build a road or a train line or lay high speed cable?

But there are economic secondary effects that should be obvious -- roads make trade easier, as does the internet, as do trains.  The small town grows and soon it's not a small town anymore -- it's no coincidence that most large cities are on rivers or near the coast, or along ancient trade routes.  There's no doubt that, especially in the long term, these investments pay off, but whom do they pay?  Not necessarily the person who built the road.

The US highway system -- increasingly in need of repair but still one of the best in the world -- was not built to satisfy the whims of the market, it was built (at huge cost) to make it easier to move troops across the country after World War II.  But who can deny that the creation of the highway system had a tremendous influence on interstate trade in the US?

Beyond the obvious problem with your logic there is an even deeper ignorance displayed.

They never left and converted is Islam when the Arabs invaded.  Further, the people now calling themselves the Jews and occupying Israeli are by and large of European stock having interbred with Europeans over two thousand years.

And they are all highly motivated to prop the dollar up, otherwise the value of their reserves will plummet.

However, if the US inflates too much, these nations will all scramble to sell their dollars. And the Fed is inflating. Be prepared for what follows next:

One day the dollar will start falling. This will motivate people with large amounts of dollars to use them to buy real stuff, further plummeting the value of the dollar.
Nobody wants this to happen, except perhaps those people who now have few dollars and lots of gold (I'm not one of them). But when it starts to happen, it will be over before you can refresh reddit.

The end result will simply be that the people who still had a lot of dollars when the process started, will now be a lot poorer.

This day will eventually come. I thought it was coming in the summer of 2008, but I was wrong, the dollar has recovered since then.
It might not come in our lifetime, but it will come.
I'm afraid 2009 might be the year, and that Obama's deficits (which require either money creation (inflation) or borrowing to pay for them) will be the straw that broke the camels back.
I hope I'm wrong.

I'm not holding any dollars, but that's easy, since I'm European. I hoping the Euro will stay strong.

My advice to Obama: cut spending and ESPECIALLY military spending drastically. This will allow you to lower the income tax and the capital gains tax. 
Better yet, create special economic zones, such as found in China. These zones will allow investors to build factories to export products. 

It's a real pity that my new MacBook was assembled in a Chinese special economic zone and flown to me, when it could have been assembled in the US. After all, it was designed by an American company and the US is the largest market for MacBooks.

You will have a 6 to 12 months recession, massive temporary unemployment, because people will leave/lose current jobs at wall street and the military, but it will be followed by a boom, because investors will use the recession to build factories, especially in special economic zones. And these former soldiers will now build MacBooks and tractors, which you can export for big $$$.

I will be in Europe pretty regularly over the next year, a couple week-long trips and a stay of a few months at some point. I would like something that could work over there both on an emergency basis or through getting a new SIM over there or through VOIP.

I use google-chat a lot, would be nice to have that available. I definitely want to be able to email, multi-task would be nice but I don't know if I want to wait for the Palm, my current phone sucks. I am interested in possibly developing for the iPhone.

It is best to continually question your own interpretations while reading *anything*; even a misreading is still a reading and so when you have more knowledge you can reread and see how your views have changed. This, I have found, allows you to build your own philosophy rather than just being able to regurgitate what the books you read said.

At the same time the path can be made easier--I started seriously reading philosophy when I was a book shop and couldn't find the book I wanted, and so I went over to a random shelf and *The Sickness Unto Death* caught my eye so I fetched that (hey, the title was pretty metal). Ah! Seeing that philosophy didn't have to be dry and boring like the later Platonic dialogues and boring English utilitarians and positivists and exceedingly verbose German idealists created an interest. Yes, my first reading of this resulted in gross misinterpretations (although, as with most *existential* literature I was able to enjoy it merely esthetically), but reading it a second time after having tackled a good portion of Kierkegaard's first authorship cleared things up as much as anything Kierkegaard wrote could be.

Of course, it would have saved me time if I had found something like the [quick introduction to the pre-Socratic philosophers](http://www.archive.org/details/philosophicclass001218mbp) in Kaufmann's *Philosophic Classics* before doing this, but such is life. 

So then what path to follow? I didn't do things in this order (having had a few courses in ethics and such many years ago), but I think the following is tolerable. (Hereafter *you* refers to the original poster).

* A quick read of some fragments of the pre-Socratics
* A few of the major Platonic dialogues (*Apology*, *Phaedo*, and *Symposium* at least)
* A bit of Aristotle (*Categories*, *Prior Analytics*, *Ethics*, and, if you want to dive into esthetics a bit, *Poetics* and *Rhetoric*)
* Perhaps a bit of Stoic philosophy if you are so inclined--Epictetitus's *Discourses* are at least an *interesting* read
* Here you can hop forward a bit in time because the Romans were dumb and the few people writing during the European Dark Ages were mostly theologians and even the few philosophers were more or less just intermediate steps between Aristotle and--
* Kant. Yes, you really do **need** to read at least the *Groundwork to the Metaphysics of Morality*. It is boring, verbose, complicated, and utterly wrong in a number of ways, but it is *essential* to understanding what comes after. If you find Kant enjoyable for some perverse reason then pick any of his other works and continue.
* Hume predates Kant, but empiricism is a bit of a different branch, so now is probably a good time to read his *Treatise of Human Nature* if you can stomach it.
* And then we come to our dear friend Hegel. Another boring verbose man who is incredibly important in a historical study of philosophy. You could probably get away with just reading the [Introduction to the first part of the Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences](http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/sl/slintro.htm) and some commentary, but at least the entire first half of the *Encyclopedia* and *Phenomenology of Geist* (Spirit, Mind, many other subtle shades) would be better; his esthetic and political works can be put off until later.
* Kierkegaard. As much Kierkegaard as you can find! At least find a copy of *Either/Or* (both halves, unabridged, in two volumes; AFAICT the Princeton Press edition is the only unabridged version still in print) and wander through it. There really isn't much Kierkegaard (at least of the pseudonymous works) that isn't worth reading.
* Nietzsche. *The Birth of Tragedy*, *The Gay Science*, *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*, *Beyond Good and Evil*, and *The Genealogy of Morals*. Yes. All of them. In that order. Do not give into the temptation to just read *Zarathustra*; Nietzsche in particular attempts to obscure his meaning unless you have as much context as possible. I agree with Kaufmann that Nietzsche was the last *World-Historical* philosopher; not very much of importance has been written since. After reading him it is *your* task to rebel against Analytics. In the immortal words of Blake (prophet and not philosopher perhaps; but *good* philosophy is more akin to prophecy than science in my mind):

&gt; Here said I! is your lot, in this space, if space it may be calld, Soon we saw the stable and the church, &amp; I took him to the altar and open'd the Bible, and lo! it was a deep pit, into which I descended driving the Angel before me, soon we saw seven houses of brick, one we enterd; in it were a number of monkeys, baboons, &amp; all of that species chaind by the middle, grinning and snatching at one another, but witheld by the shortness of their chains: however I saw that they sometimes grew numerous, and then the weak were caught by the strong and with a grinning aspect, first coupled with &amp; then devourd, by plucking off first one limb and then another till the body was left a helpless trunk. this after grinning &amp; kissing it with seeming fondness they devourd too; and here &amp; there I saw one savourily picking the flesh off of his own tail; as the stench terribly annoyd us both we went into the mill, &amp; I in my hand brought the skeleton of a body, which in the mill was Aristotles Analytics.

From there? I'm not so sure. I have a bit of Sarte in my stack of books to read (mmm used book shops resulting in weird hardcovers from the 50s and 60s coming into my hands for a few bucks), but I'm only three years into my own journey and still have another half a year before I get there (now I am going through a bit of re-reading and attempting to delve a bit into boring *mainstream* political theory and such... let me tell you, English people are incredibly dull and I really can't fathom how people like Locke have had any influence on modern thought).

I have been in a very similar situation. I feel for you. For me it's been about four years and that part of me that died is still dead. It will always be dead. You've learned something about women. 

Most women don't marry for love. They marry a provider. If you can't support a family single-handedly, don't get married. Most women would say no and even if they said yes they'd regret it for the rest of their lives. 

Relationships (friend and romantic) are completely different for women. They don't have relationships for the sole reasons of companionship and good times. I'm not exactly sure how women feel about relationships, but they can gain and drop best friends at will, marry a man after a week, and become friends with their new boss in about a day. These are not things, I believe, most men can relate to. 

Young women are all about having kids. Whether subconscious or conscious, that's their primary motivation. They're looking for a provider. You obviously aren't that provider when you can't even pay back your student loans and need her help. Women who've had kids and are in their forties and fifties are different and make vastly better partners, BTW. 

Now, why would she be all lovey dovey with you for so many years if she didn't want to marry? That's how women are. Their perception of relationships is skewed some way or another. 

In most other societies and in the past in western European society, men did not usually have close relationships with their wives. You bought your wife and treated her accordingly. In many ways, I see the logic of this. Many women prefer to be kept and taken care of. Rare was the 50/50 marriage where the husband and wife were an unshakable team who tackled their problems together. The latter would be my ideal of marriage, and it sounds like it would also appeal to you, but I hate to tell you that that's *not* the way most women are going to see marriage. They want their husband/daddy to take care of them while they're free to do whatever they please. If asked to help with the household well, why don't you earn enough to hire a maid? What kind of man are you? 

The most positive thing you can take away is that you've learned. You've learned to be more guarded in the future. Make a woman *earn* your love and you won't regret it. 

(I know there's going to be women who want to comment on this post. Well, don't bother unless you want to list your income and your husband's income and your husband's extended family's income. Because otherwise you're talking out of your ass. Something else to add: when economic modeling is done of marriage trends, you find that women marry where the money is. There are exceptions, but they are outliers. Objective reality holds that women marry the richest man they can possibly dupe. This is what the data reveals. Sorry to burst everyone's bubble.)

So what do you need to do? Forget about her (we both know you won't. I never forgot about my love either. But her company will only bring you misery from now on). Forget about women for awhile. Work hard and make as much money as you possibly can. When you are good provider material, a woman will find you and earn *your* love instead of the other way around. You've had your youthful fun with whores (I'm trying to invoke archaic language here) now you must settle down, make yourself into a good provider, and find a good woman. 

Just to add: I want to explain her behavior. She enjoys your company, but you aren't a good provider. She is keeping you on the line until she thinks she's run out of options. What you want to do about that is up to you. I think you should concentrate on work and forget her and women for awhile. ",1234292715,-1,-1,t5_2qh1i,[deleted]

But typically Americans display a confidence that many people take for arrogance.  My girlfriend works at a cafe (we're in NZ) and gets yelled at by Americans all the time who're absolutely dumbfounded that she won't take US currency.

If you go to Europe you can be in a church, or an art gallery surrounded by people from all over the world and all of a sudden you hear ""Hey Faye! FAYE! Wow! Look at THAT - it's just like the one we have in Cincinnati! WOW!"" And the funny thing is that travellers from all around the world who speak different languages and don't know each other at all, will look at each other and slowly shake their head.  It's like an international shared-joke that doesn't need articulating.

We were enjoying a dinner in Paris at this quiet french place with a lot of atmosphere when a table of drunken Americans started singing ""MIC-KEY MOUSE!"" at the top of their lungs.  That was a thorn in the side of international relations right there.

But to be more general, I find Americans overseas see everything through a lens of ""This is not like/this is like America."" Which we all do really, but the difference is that Americans tend to see their own culture as superior by default.  This, along with the fact that many of them are quite outspoken about their views, can offend a lot of people at displays of culture.

I used to live with a bunch of American frat-boys from Georgia (in NZ) when I was at university - and New Zealand has this kind of cool secret culture that the locals can show you if they like you - but after about a week, and hearing some disparaging remarks about some Maori cultural displays they attended, we realised that ""they just don't get it."" So we decided to let them find their own way.  The result of which is that they drove around the country going ""Wow - that hill is beautiful. Wow - look at that tree!  It's just like lord of the rings!"" And they missed out on the secret waterfalls, caves, secluded beaches etc we would've showed them.

That's my two cents anyway - I have met a few Americans that I like, and you couldn't say that I'm against the US per-se, but the actions and opinons of many of the US citizens that travel abroad do a great deal towards lowering the world's opinion of the American people as a whole.

It is also amazing how simplistic their worldviews and politics seem to be.  Unless they're the redditor types, I steer clear of discussing politics with yanks - because they get usually get offended at the slightest criticism of their country.

But if they do then watch out for liars like Prof Goose and The Energy Watch Group. Same kind of deal with http://energybulletin.net except there watch out for the permaculturists and survivalists.

My judgement of the coal situation was synthesized from disparate pieces of information. Like the fact that after a very long period of decline in international prices for coal, the price has risen and is expected to rise continuously for the next decades. Also the fact that European (German and Spanish) coal mining is drawing to an end as government subsidies are withdrawn. Which means that coal power plants in those countries will have to be powered by Australian coal. And Australian coal is already in great demand from Japan and increasingly China. Which brings up another bit, only a couple decades ago China was a net exporter of coal. It managed to double its burning of coal by massively increasing production but mostly by turning from a major exporter to a major importer.

That brings up another reason to build nuclear power plants and do away with coal. Besides the usual litany of air and water pollution using particulates, SOx, NOx, arsenic and mercury, as well as the millions of deaths from all causes, there is the enormous cramp it puts on railways. Passenger rail in Germany is such complete shit because Germany is a coal country which means it's ideologically against nuclear reactors (which is just another governmental subsidy for the coal industry) but also most of its rail capacity is dedicated to hauling coal. If Deutsche Bahn weren't hauling coal, they wouldn't be so obsessed with freight and wouldn't be sneering at their passenger business. They might even have high speed trains worthy of the train instead of being known far and wide as having slow-assed shit. German high-speed: slow, expensive and dangerous (the only one in the world to ever have a fatality). Oh but ""luxurious"".

I recommend the wikipedia pages on coal to bone up on anthracite, butiminous, subbutiminous. And then maybe the page on clinker, calcination and cement. Then the page on Electric Arc Furnaces. Maybe some stuff on Integrated Steel Mills for comparison. Microwaving steel for fun? There was a paper titled something like ""1 barrel per tonne"" (as a goal) that was good. And DEFINITELY check out the FINEX process invented by Siemens VAI and prototyped, demonstrated &amp; deployed by POSCO (Pohang Iron and Steel Company) which sounds a lot more impressive when you know that the Koreans are the world leader in steelmaking. Australians are stupid enough to ship their coal AND their iron to Korea so it can smelt it and sell them steel back. They're a fucking colony.

Sorry, that doesn't really answer your question but that's all I know except for a few bits about the North American coal market. Oh and how it's tied to oil. Oh and that slag [leftovers from steelmaking] is used to make nuclear-grade heavy concrete.

I took a basic course on art history in high school, and it opened my eyes to the many ways there are to express (Eurocentric) beauty, from the Renaissance to early modernism.

As for carbon fiber, it's just woven graphite and it's already here as well. But it's not gonna get any cheaper since graphite's fairly expensive. It's an expensive form of coal!

Graphite sells at about 4000$ per tonne. Steel sells at about 1000$ per tonne. And coal rarely rises above 100$ per tonne. Why the hell would you want to move to a MORE scarce and limited resource than steel? For that matter, what could we ever use as a structural material if not steel? Iron's the most plentiful shit there is. It's the most stable element there is - everything else fuses up or fissions down into it.

Also, I'm quite hostile to ANY talk of conservation because we need to expand industry by about an order of magnitude to lift everyone out of poverty. AND efficiency is utterly stupid if your goal is conservation. Look up Jevon's paradox to find out why. Greater efficiency has a BIG tendency to increase resource use. But then Greens are idiot, which is why they are against nuclear power and in favour of efficiency. Deep down they're just reactionary knee-jerk anti-humanity and anti-industry assholes.

&gt; I don't think it would have to be as dirt-cheap as you might say, just because I think we need a heavy carbon tax that would make nuclear

Nuclear is ALREADY competitive with coal. Even in the USA it's always been THE most competitive thing. The only problem is securing financing (ie, finding more benevolent rather than predatory bankers) and securing political will (ie, finding judges who won't listen to Greenpeace lies). Just remember that France did it and they have some of the cheapest electricity prices in all of Europe. And that's on top of the French government constantly raiding Electricite de France when they have budget shortfalls.

&gt; For instance, could you replace the powdered coal with more hydrogen, or an electric arc? 

No. Electric Arc Furnaces are only appropriate for recycling steel. You need steel scrap to even start the process. What you're not getting is that an Integrated Steel Mill is a CHEMICAL plant that uses CARBON from coal as a chemical, not as an energy source. The fact the chemical reaction has to occur at a high temperature is a happenstance. The fact using coal is a cheap way of attaining that temperature is a happy coincidence. An integrated steel mill is a chemical plant first, a physical processing (rolling into sheets or whatever) plant second, and a giant furnace last.

Hydrogen reduction of iron is a Wild Assed Guess on my part. It's barely an engineering concept. I know it can be done, I know it has been done on a really small scale. I don't know anything beyond that.

And yes, hydrogen would REALLY have to be cheap. It would have to beat the price of coal which runs between 30-75$ per tonne. And no amount of carbon taxes will make a difference unless hydrogen can be produced for much less than 100-200$ per tonne. Carbon weighs 12 times as much as hydrogen, but it binds 4 times as much oxygen as hydrogen does (compare CO2 vs H2O).

---

On the subject of energy abundance, that's a tough question. One problem is that even if you can produce energy cheaply, transporting it is difficult. Transporting electricity's pretty fucking cheap but its cost is comparable to the production cost of electricity. And it's not going to get any cheaper because you need labour, meaning human beings, to put up and maintain high voltage lines on towers.

If the cost of producing electricity were reduced to zero, the price of electricity would only fall so much. For instance, in the next decade or two, the cost of enriching uranium will fall to essentially zero as laser enrichment comes online. All this will do is expose nuclear power plants to the (much smaller) price of RAW uranium. The price of nuclear electricity will barely budge.

So the only solution is to use the energy produced at its source. And the only good way of doing that is if the power sources are very small (size of a heavy truck or smaller). Or you're doing something that requires lots of energy in-place. And you know what? It's not just transporting the electricity that's a bottleneck. Fucking *generating* it, either with generators or turbines, is a bottleneck too.

The only viable scenario is if you produce hydrogen electrochemically and then use this hydrogen immediately without long transport. OR you use the heat from your energy source directly, say to heat up a field of shale or a glacier.

You know, we actually HAVE all the brute force we need in the form of nuclear bombs. Making it do anything useful takes finesse.

At this stage of the game, energy is not a bottleneck and no matter how much of it you have available, it won't ever be a bottleneck. We need finesse.",1234302375,2,2,t5_2qh13,redditcensoredme

&gt;America didn’t even want to go it alone in the 2003 Iraq war to topple Saddam Hussein, and managed to put together a small group of its closest allies before invading.

The topic is about the ridiculous Republican arm-waving over the fear that adopting more socialist programs will turn us into Europe, made even more embarrassing by the demonstrably better standard of living the Europeans enjoy. 

My original statement was a response to jbzd's post that lamented the ""75%"" tax burden of the rich. In my statement, I mocked jbzd's lamentation and sought to contrast the suffering of the rich with the suffering of the poor. I never said that millions of poor people are starving to death. You inferred that erroneously. 

And whether the notion that millions of poor people spend 75% of their time just obtaining food is factually true was, from the get go, is a moot point. I don't care what the statistic is. It was a rhetorical device to point out the absurdity of fretting over the tax rate of the rich when so many more people deal with very real issues of going hungry, becoming homeless, getting access to medical care, etc. 

So you're free to choose, you can continue tilting at windmills or engage in a legitimate argument or drop it all together. 

You seem to love to point out logical fallacies in the strawmen you set up, without ever once acknowledging the utter lack of merit in your first message, which consisted of creating a strawman out of the 75% figure, and then blowing smoke about the generosity of the US to Africa. WTF did that ever have to do with _anything_ discussed here?

You write, ""You remain focused on the wealthy as though they were stealing food out of the mouths of the poor in order to line their pockets."" Strawman. Never said it. Never implied it. If you cannot stick to the conversation, just shut up. My point is simple, although it appears to evade you: Whining about the plight of the rich in the face of the visceral challenges faced by the poor rings hollow. You may have a different opinion.

	Nobody's safe. 
That's the warning from the first large-scale study of medical bankruptcy.
	Health insurance? 
That didn't protect 1 million Americans who were financially ruined by illness or medical bills last year.
***
http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/credit/interviews/warren.html
	You have been studying primarily bankruptcy for the last 20 years. Why bankruptcy?
	Because bankruptcy is about financial death and financial rebirth. 
What is BANKRUPTCY?
	Bankruptcy is the great American story rewritten. 
Why do you think people left Europe to come to the United States? 
	They left because they were in debt. 
What is the GREAT MYTH?
	The First IMMIGRANTS or FOUNDING FATHERS came for religious freedom.
No, it was about debt. They were looking for a way to escape their debts.
Why did the American Colonists move West?
	Did they go because they hated the native Indians or just go
for a vacation in the wilderness?
	No, it is to escape DEBT BONDAGE.
	It's the way that people say: ""I got out there; I borrowed the money; I did my best; 
I used that money to start a small business or to keep myself going in my job. ... 
You rolled the dice with me. ... It didn't work. 
You can have most of what I own, and that's it, though. We'll stop there. We'll declare the default. 
You write off the part of the debt I can't pay, I'll take my human energy ... 
and go right back into the game again."" That's the whole premise behind bankruptcy. 
It's about death and rebirth.
Did the FOUNDING FATHERS understand debt bondage and debtor's prisons in England?
	the founding fathers, even before the Bill of Rights, put in a provision that says 
Congress will have the power to establish a uniform law of bankruptcies.
Why is American Small BUSINESS the envy of the world as the primary 
engine of economic growth?
	It was all about how we want to make sure that people have ... 
	the enthusiasm, the incentive, to get out there and try.
Why did England become poor and America become rich?		
	The notion was anyone whose complete income was going to be seized by his creditors, anyone whose 
farm was all going to be taken away, anything that was produced, wouldn't have very much reason to get 
up and go to work, wouldn't have very much reason to plough the fields.
	So bankruptcy was a way to take the human beings who had gambled and lost and get them back into the game. 
Better that they be back in the game, working and starting their businesses, so that they earn taxes that 
help all of us. Better that America believes in a business sense, in rebirth, than in ... the 
taint of debt ... and some form of death following that.

It's not pandering for farmer's votes.  It's the very powerful and very wealthy agricultural lobby, which buys representatives in congress and its equivalents abroad; those representatives then use fear-mongering to convince the people that allowing the developing world an equal playing field would some how harm American/European independence and sovereignty.  (Usually this takes the form of ""we need to be able to grow our own food!  What if everyone in the world refuses to sell us food?"")

&gt;Well, whatever the reason, it's unlikely to go away (btw, ever heard of the local food movement?), so how should the developing countries deal with this?

I think developing countries are essentially powerless to really effect any change themselves.  Reducing protectionism in the developed world is really the only way, as I see it, to bring true wealth to the developing world.  Unfortunately, a relatively large number of people in the developed world seem to want expressly the opposite, lobbying instead for protectionist measures that force them to pay more for locally-produced goods and deprive people able and willing to do the work the opportunity to do so.

The thing that I find strange about this is that protectionism tends to most frequently be championed by the left, when in my experience people on the left are more likely to say that they want to help the poor than people on the right are (I would consider myself to be rather far on the left, for what it's worth).

I think some of this is due to very intelligent manipulation of public opinion by entrenched interests hostile to fair competition.  A good example is the fair trade movement -- it's an easy sell to people who want to do the right thing but don't understand economics very well.  Local producers say, ""You're exploiting third world labor when you buy product XYZ.  Insist on purchasing only goods manufactured by companies that provide first-world income and benefits to their workers.""  It sounds good until you realize the real motivation: removing the competitive advantage that workers in the third world have, namely extremely low cost of labor.

I lived in the developing world for several years and very few Americans or Europeans are fully aware of the purchasing power of the US dollar, the Euro, or the Pound.  In rural China, you can live for a week on a few dollars.  And China is developed by emerging markets standards; there are lots of places where a dollar will last you a month.  A person making a first world salary in a place like this is quite literally the local equivalent of a millionaire.  The local jobs available to the common man -- mostly farming -- pay little or nothing (sustenance farming is still common).  When a company opens, say, a shoe factory in the vicinity that pays a few bucks a day, that's a *very* good job by local standards.

Protectionist policies like fair trade make opening such factories uneconomical, because the low cost of labor is about the only thing that developing economies have to offer.  Typically infrastructure is poor, security is a problem, police are corrupt, everyone wants a bribe -- these costs of doing business add up.  And the local population isn't as well educated, isn't as healthy, and yes, isn't typically as productive as a western worker.  So when you erect artificial barriers, the company says to itself, ""What's the benefit of opening up shop in Senegal or Benin?  I can go to somewhere more developed and get better workers for the same price.""  Result: the local economy continues to stagnate, and the people don't get that first world salary the fair traders thought they were helping them get -- and since the ""sweat shop"" salary we always hear about is still more than what they would be making otherwise, they're even worse off than they would have been had some imperialistic westerner opened up an exploitative factory nearby.

Now, I don't necessarily oppose poor nations doing what they can to keep capital in -- ie, asymmetrical protectionism -- but whenever that happens, people on the right cry foul and claim that they're not playing fair.  I don't think it really matters much -- as long as local people are being paid a salary the local economy will flourish on its own scale.  Wage inflation will take care of itself as time goes on.

I guess that's where we disagree: I don't think protectionism on the part of the developing nations is sufficient or necessary.  The western world needs to tear down trade barriers, and it needs to open its borders to immigration.  We're wealthy, we're dynamic, and we can handle a little bit of competition.",1234309639,1,1,t5_2cneq,808140

If you had a choice between killing a kid who joined the Hitler Youth movement because his society told him to, and trying to educate him out of his ways, which would you choose? 

If, as I hope, you'd try to give the kid a chance to mend his ways, why would you bother? By your argument, he belongs to a hated group, and should be dealt with in the way hated people are dealt with (death penalty, life in prison, etc). However, if you'd try to educate individuals within a hateful group, you must then concede that the ideology is distinct from the individual.

People who join hate-groups as adults -- where ""adult"" is defined as a person sufficiently independent from familial or societal pressures to make such a choice -- are the type of people I think you are targeting. While I agree that this has less to do with intelligence, I would argue that it has more to do with a general level of ""thought"" (which is why I chose to say ""those who think more"" as opposed to ""those who are smarter"").

Insofar as we ""hate"" (if that's the route you wish to take) individuals who commit crimes in the name of a larger group, you'd be hard-pressed to come up with an ideology that cannot be radicalized. Even ""pacifism"" can cause harm, by crimes of omission, etc, if the pacifist in question was inclined to do so.

I believe that comparing Turkey vs. the Ottoman Empire is closer to comparing France vs. the French Empire. I still think it's stupid for Turks to argue over semantics regarding the genocide, they (I guess, we) should just accept it and move on because the responsible parties are all gone and the only thing keeping it an active issue is the debate over whether whatever happened could be called a ""genocide"" or not. Basically, it's comparable to a grammar nazi internet fight. 


Regarding what you said, since it wasn't the Germans themselves who revolted and defeated the Nazi regime, I don't think the comparison is quite valid.


Keep in mind that the [Turkish War of Independence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_War_of_Independence) was fought against the Ottoman Empire after they had caved in and aligned themselves with the ""allies"" of World War I, so the opinions of the Ottoman Empire were more accepted by the West than they were by the Turks. This act of revolution clears modern Turks of any obligation to apologize for the actions of the former Empire, and all they'd have to do now is accept that a genocide or similar incident took place, publicly show that they regret it happened, and move on.

That is not because of an inability to compete in the market.  First, the US provides smaller agricultural subsidies [than does the EU, which spends a huge amount of money on subsidies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_subsidy#European_Union).  Just about every third *Economist* magazine I read complains about the extent of EU agricultural subsidies.  The US is a successful exporter of huge amounts of agricultural products each year.

Second, the [reason that agricultural subsidies existed in the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_policy_of_the_United_States#Beginning_of_price_supports) were because of Depression-era policies that never died.  (Actually, I thought that this was in the 30s and 40s, but WP says that some of the relevant legislation dated to the 20s.)

*""Recall that Marx also thought that socialist revolutions would first break out in the advanced capitalist countries.""*

This is not at all true. Marx made claim to the idea that the nations such as Germany, England, France and North America would be more likely to go into revolutionary struggle first on the basis of class antagonism being higher than that of more feudal societies. He did not say with absolutism that it would happen that way. Also, Marx was not alive to see the turn of the century. He did not see the growth of Capitalism to Imperialism (though it was not beyond his comprehension). He also did not see the effect Engels' and his works would have on the working class and political climate of Europe. When Marx and Engels brought to the fore their claims of revolutionary struggle, they had not considered the fact that the alternatives to Capitalism had yet to be offered to smaller Feudal nations. We can see clearly, that these alternatives being offered in Russia, meant that it was possible for Russia to move from Feudalism to Socialism. However, this required rapid industrialisation for it to be successful, either that, or for revolutionary upheaval to be successful elsewhere (such as Germany, which was relied upon by the later Communist Party of Russia.)

*""You say that socialism in one country is something that Marx would not have supported.""*

This is neither a question, nor an ambiguous idea. This is a concrete fact. Marx did not support the notion of Socialism/Communism in one country. He makes that perfectly clear in the Communist Manifesto, among other works. Marx was clear that working people of the world had no nation, they were an international class, and for their emancipation to be successful it had to be an act of the entirety of the working class.

What Marx actually said on the topic of internationalism vs nationalism was that the Proletarians of each nation had to first wage war against their own Bourgeoisie. He said specifically that it was the role of Communists to represent the interests of the whole working class, and as such, argue for internationalism, to say that emancipation is not won until the whole of the Bourgeois Class has been overthrown.

If you do not believe my above points, I will gladly quote at length in another response.

In regards to your repeated claim of the 'failure of Trotskyism.' 

Again, I have to say that you are wrong. Clearly, you have not the knowledge base of the far left, or the labour movement of europe during the 60s and 70s, or even as late as the 80s. Clearly, you know very little about the role Trotskyism played overall.

Trotskyism has not died out either, as opposed to the majority of Stalinism, which has by and large fallen to the history books as the unnacceptable idea of totalitarian regimes.

Trotskyism played a huge role in Socialist groups and working class movements through Europe. It was an opposition to Stalinism, primarily. It was also thanks to Trotskyism that later Trotskyites theorised (albeit a little late) that the U.S.S.R was not merely a 'degenerate workers' state' but rather a new ruling class, if you will, a nationalised bourgeoisie. In otherwords, Stalin and his followship harbored support of the middle classes, as had happened in the past, and created a new bourgeoisie. This ruling class however, did not have the same freedoms as other bourgeois across the world. This did change though, as Stalinist forms of Nationalisation and totalitarianism began to be turned on after his death.

It is thanks to Trotskyists that the revolutionary spirit of Marxist theory and Communism continues to exist. Without them, it is very likely that Communism could have fallen to the grave with Stalin and the U.S.S.R or China.

Though, I'll turn to my own perspective on the question of Trotskyism now, one absent of the above.

One of the major tenets of Revolutionary Socialism, or rather, Marxist theory, of Leninist / Trotskyist practise, is not to concern ourselves so much with the horrors of being a minority within a movement. Revolutionary struggle is an objective factor within Capitalist Society. It will, at one point or another, in an uneven swing, push the proletariat toward mass class struggle. Whilst numbers and influence are key to successful Socialist revolution, these struggles will occur with or without us. What kept Trotskyism alive, and why it cannot be considered a failure, is its basis on maintaining an opposition to the falsification and distortion of Communism / Socialism. To keep the revolutionary, Marxist spirit alive, so that if the fight cannot be won today, it can be won tomorrow.

In closing, it is possible to create the foundations for socialist society in individual nations. This however is not the self-emancipation of the whole of the proletariat, and therefore, is not truly Socialism, or Communism.",1234332813,1,1,t5_2qjii,[deleted]

&gt;There is a second dimension. It is the organizational dimension, which is really not solely organizational, but is, in reality, also political. Here we come to that famous question of centralization. Revolutionary Marxists stand for democratic centralism. But the word centralization is not to be taken in the first place as an organizational dimension, and in no way whatsoever is it essentially an administrative one. It is political. What does ""centralization"" mean? It means centralization of experience, centralization of knowledge, centralization of conclusions drawn out of actual militancy. Here, again, we see a tremendous danger for the working class and the labor movement if there is no such centralization of experience: this is the danger of sectorialization and fragmentation, which does not enable anyone to draw adequate conclusions for action.

&gt;If we have women militants engaged only in feminist struggles, if we have youth militants engaged only in youth struggles, if we have students engaged only in student struggles, if we have immigrant workers engaged only in immigrant worker struggles, if we have oppressed nationalities engaged only in oppressed nationalities' struggles, if we have unemployed engaged only in unemployed struggles, if we have trade unionists engaged only in trade union struggles, if we have unorganized, un-unionized, essentially unskilled workers engaged only in their own struggles, if we have political militants engaged only in election campaigns or in the publication of newspapers, and if each of them operates separately from each other, they operate only on the basis of limited and fragmented experience and they cannot (for basic, I would say, epistemological reasons) draw correct conclusions from their own experience. They have fragmented struggles, fragmented experience, fragmented partial consciousness. They only see part of the whole picture. The conclusions which they come up with will be, you can say a priori, at least partially wrong. They cannot have an overall, total correct view of reality because they see only a fragmented part of that reality.

&gt;The same thing is true, of course, from an international point of view. If you concentrate only on Eastern Europe, you have a partial view of world reality. If you concentrate only on the underdeveloped, semi-colonial, dependent countries, you have a partial view of world reality, If you concentrate only on the imperialist countries, you have a partial view of world reality. Only if you bring together the experience of the concrete struggles conducted by the real masses in the three sectors of the world (which are also called the three sectors of world revolution), then you have an overall, correct view of world reality. That is the big advantage of the Fourth International, because it is an international organization, which has comrades actually fighting, not only theoretically analyzing, in all these three sectors of the world, and it is concretely related to the struggles in all these three sectors of world revolution. This superiority is not due to the great intelligence of leaders of the Fourth International. It is just due to that elementary centralization of concrete experience of struggles on a global scale, added to a correct historical program.

&gt;That is what centralization is all about. It means that, I would not say the best because that is exaggerated, but at least good fighters in the unions, good fighters among unskilled workers and the unemployed, good fighters among oppressed nationalities, good fighters among women, youth, and students, good anti-imperialist fighters, good fighters in all these sectors of actually militant, oppressed, and exploited people in each state and on a world scale, come together to centralize their experiences in order to compare the lessons of their struggles on a statewide and worldwide scale, draw relevant conclusions, examine and reexamine in a critical way at each stage their program and their political line, in the light of the lessons to be drawn out of all these experiences, in order to have an overall view of society, of the world, of its dynamics, and of our common socialist goal and how to get there. That is what we call, in our jargon, a correct program, a correct strategy, and correct tactics. Given the uneven development of class consciousness, and the uneven and discontinuous level of class activity, this cannot be done by the masses in their totality.

I'm not sure how to respond to your post because the idea that the Nazis decided to exterminate Jews (among other ethnicities and political groups) just because Hitler hated them in particular is flat out wrong. The Jews (again - among other groups) were targeted for a variety of reasons all much larger than the simple fact of Hitler's hatred. And in fact, if you study European history, you would find that the Jews were targeted by governments for harassment on a near constant basis. The anti-Jewish Nazi campaign was simply the last in a long line of anti-Jewish campaigns long practiced by European countries. 

The larger issue, I believe, is the way ethnic minorities are treated within nation-states. Is the Holocaust an outlier? Unusual in some way? No, I don't believe so. As recently as 1994 we had a genocide in Rawanda. 

In the end the best response to your post I think I can come up with is that the Jews were most likely targeted for their land, wealth, and possessions.

It's a losing battle, but I'm open to suggestions.  Is there a sensible language to talk about either antisemitic vandalism/attacks or Palestinian deaths without recourse to Holocaust metaphors?

Similarly, rationalism is a way of thinking that takes only a limited number of parameters into account, such as:

- what's surely known (Descartes -&gt; Enlightenment)
- what's empirically known (science -&gt; Enlightenment)
- the exact wording of the Bible, Qu'ran etc. (Fundies -&gt; Enlightenment backported to religion)
- distribution of consumption (Socialism, disregarding psychological factors in producing stuff, the problem of the distribution of capital goods, backdoors, corruption, bureaucracy and many other things)
- personal freedom (Libertarianism, disregarding a lot of other things, such as that people aren't good enough not to vote for exploitative policies, also community life, the paradox of the ego, culture etc. etc.)

Now, in many cases Rationalism works, just like software work for a lot of things.

But not for everything. Take fitness for example.

There is an assload of articles on the net on how to exercise and how to eat healthy, how to keep fit and be healthy and lose weight. So why are we (we = US/UK + Europe quickly catching up) so bloody fat?

Well, because the fitness gurus optimize their suggestions on scientific knowledge about the human body. So it's like a software function that takes the human body as a parameter and returns suggestions to exercise: fitnessAdvice(humanBody) -&gt; returns List of Suggestions. It's a very similar approach to that of Fundies: fundieReading(holyBook) -&gt; returns List of Rules.

What's the problem with it? Why are we fat then? Well, because what they don't take into account is the human mind, psychology, desires, preferences, habits etc.: their exercise methods are _boring_ and they are all stuff 90% of us doesn't _like_ to do.

So in order to have a better approach to fitness, we must extend the range of parameters: f.e. let humanMind = Sum(desires, habits, preferences) and thus write a function like betterFitnessAdvice(humanBody, humanMind) -&gt; returns List of Suggestions.

A better fitness advice would thus be: find something you like, most likely something you liked in the past. If you liked basketball at high school, then go and play it 3 days a week. No, it won't be as optimal for humanBody as scientific fitness, but it has the huge advantage that you might actually _do_ it, because it's more optimal for your instance of humanMind. Similarly, take a look at the list of those things you _already_ _like_ _to_ _eat_, split them into a healthier and less healthy half, and eat only the healthier half, in a good balance, of course. That's not as good a diet for humanBody as the scientific diets but more optimal for humanMind: you are much more likely to follow it.

OK it's still software, but a better software. OTOH a really good fitness strategy is like fitnessStrategy(humanMind, humanBody, availableTime, season, maritalStatus, age, placeOfLiving, job, weather... ) - and I don't want to see any such code in a software I maintain, such algorithm is a mess :)

Thus, real wisdom isn't quite like software, well, not quite like _good_ software because it must take an assload of parameters.

EDIT: of course, the fitnessStrategy function can be written like fitnessStrategy(Object[] o), i.e. a potentially unlimited list of any kinds of objects, ""things"", from marital status to weather and that's a simpler signature. But the whole point is that while the human wisdom works exactly this way, it's pretty bad software, as the caller of such clue hasn't any clue what kinds of objects you expect and what will you do with them.",1234350216,1,1,t5_2qh5b,[deleted]

Sharia is a general term for law across dozens of different Islamic sects and literally millions of variations of beliefs. Some of these may stipulate some of these specific rules and punishments, others don't.

You will find very similar 'laws' in many other religions. Take for example the Yazidis in Iraq who recently stoned a girl to death in the street while she screamed in pain and begged for mercy for several minutes until her skull was cracked open by these savage little pigs.

&gt; I didn't attach it, closing your eyes does not make the reality change.

I am not closing my eyes. Attaching this to one race or religion will get you nowhere and achieve nothing, worse than nothing: many innocent people who have absolutely no interest in these savage punishments will be hurt, the whole thing will turn into a holocaust.

I am interested in attaching blame to _one_ group: those who seriously believe in stoning, amputating, flogging etc., and want to make these things a reality. They know who they are.

They are like any other psychopath, rapist or murderer, the same rules should apply to them: stop them, prosecute them, bar them from our countries, boycott them if they are in power, call them what they are: murderers, torturers, psychopaths.

There is no reason to bring race or religion into it. What may or may not be interpreted from religious texts is irrelevant. Most religious texts can be interpreted in bad ways, it doesn't matter. I like playing GTA, that doesn't mean I believe in shooting hookers.

When you attach race or religion to this problem you become a right-wing knee-jerk reactionist and you _will_ be treated like one and your cause will go nowhere. People will easily dismiss you and your points because what they will see is some KKK wannabe going on about how its all the Ay'rabs or the Mus'lims fault.

This is exactly why so many European governments are denouncing films like Fitna, because these films just miss the point entirely and turn into an attack on one group of people, a group who is very clearly made up of good and bad people just like any other.

If Wilders for example, really wants to make an impact he should re-make his film to attack barbaric acts _directly_ and not through quotes from the Koran. I can find similar quotes in the Bible and a dozen other texts, and yes, I know ""Christians don't practice this"" yada yada I've heard it all before: the fact that all these Christian countries may not be as barbaric as Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with Islam and everything to do with a complex social and political history.

What the Bible or Koran may or may not say is not the point. Right now, the point is that we need to stop barbaric acts. You can all argue over these books _another_ day, a day when people are not being brutally tortured and flogged.

The pattern has been constant: Protect your industry while developing, open up when strong and competitive.

I don't think this is actually true.  The European powers have been trading with each other for much longer than governments have had the infrastructure necessary to truly enforce trade controls.  In more recent memory, the situation is different, but if you go back far enough, I think you'll find that true protectionism of the style practiced today was unworkable even if the desire to enforce it was there.

But as I said in my earlier post, I don't think it actually matters in practice if a developing country enforces protectionist policies as long as its more powerful trading partners (ie, us) don't do the same.  That's the real danger -- protectionism in isolation might benefit a developing nation (I'm not closed to this idea, I just don't know if we have the data) but in practice it never occurs in isolation, because trade agreements tend to follow a tit-for-tat model.  When China manipulates its currency, for example -- absolutely the right thing for it to do given its current position -- its western trading partners cry foul.  When Russia and Putin institute protectionist policies, nationalize their oil and gas sectors -- not necessarily the wrong decision for them -- their western trading partners cry foul.

In the particular case of Russia and China, they represent too large a market for us to write off, and so we don't, but smaller, poorer countries don't have that clout when they come to the negotiating table.

Then there's another question that I think is worth analyzing -- even if we accept your premise, did protectionism in the developmental period actually benefit the countries in question?

What makes you think that protecting your local companies from global competition will in any way prepare them adequately for when protectionist measures are lifted?

Also, I don't want you to completely misunderstand my position.  I don't believe that truly developing nations benefit from laissez-faire free market policies; I don't think it's coincidence that literally every single developed nation was either an autocratically driven planned economy or a colony of such a nation up until its industrialization.  There are literally no successful developing nations that followed the democratic capitalist model (the Philippines and virtually all of Latin America are shining examples of how drastically this can fail).  The European powers were all monarchies, the Soviet, Chinese, and Vietnamese economies were bootstrapped from poverty by Communism, India, the world's largest democracy, was run by the British until the 1940s (and they subsequently allied with the USSR in the cold war, following many socialist policies), Japan was an Empire until after WWII, Taiwan a police state until 1987, South Korea and Brazil were similar, etc.

On the other hand, one need only look at Africa for an example of how badly the benevolent dictator model can fail.  Most dictators aren't benevolent, but democracy -- essentially a dictatorship of the masses -- is going to fail spectacularly because industrialization and development are painful, and people will complain.  Give them a voice too early and they'll undercut their own prosperity, in the same way that a three year old refuses to eat his vegetables.  I know that sounds condescending, and I wish it weren't so, but history certainly seems to support it.

So I think in a sense we agree that the best economic and political model for a developing nation is not the same as the best economic and political model for a developed one, and simply disagree on the implementation details.  Your position seems to be that economic protectionism is sufficient and I think that at best economic protectionism when you have little or nothing to protect anyway has no real effect and at worst is harmful, because it creates a barrier for foreign capital entering your local market.

My position is that a strong government investing in infrastructure and education, whatever its political affiliation, is necessary for some time before democracy can be stable.  Further, I believe that in absence of a strong rule of law, market economics typically does not function properly -- I firmly reject the position of anarcho-capitalists who think that the market is a stable mechanism in absence of the state.  Perhaps on a small scale, but not on a large one -- directed economic development is necessary in order to build a stable backbone upon which the market can function.

Understand also that saying that a dictatorship is the most developmentally efficient system is not the same as saying it is the most moral one or the most desirable one.  Again, I firmly reject the position taken by the right that economic efficiency is the be-all-end-all.  The market may provably be the most efficient allocator of resources on a society level, but I can tolerate a fair amount of inefficiency if it means individual liberty and prosperity.  This is part of why I am a firm supporter of the welfare state.

I think Marx's analysis of use-value and exchange-value of commodities is productive and important, although I reject much of the labor theory of value.  Laissez-faire capitalism uses exchange-value as a proxy for use-value (to the point where no distinction is made), which I think breaks down often enough that it represents a flaw in modern economic analysis.

As I said, I lived in the developing world for quite some time and there's no doubt that economic investment and free trade helps more than it hurts.  But wealth polarization is a real problem, even if everyone is getting richer, because the poor, who may be better off than they were before, are still poor, and the disparity breeds exploitation.  I don't know if you remember, but a few years ago there was a TV segment called ""Bum Fight"" or something similar where they found two bums and paid them to fight.  That they were willing to do so explains the problem of wealth polarization in a nutshell -- as long as the poor are poor enough (and they are in much of the world) class exploitation will continue, with the wealthy offering what they consider small amounts of money to the poor to exploit them.  By virtue of the wealth gap, this ""small amount of money"" is not small to the poor person.  Prostitution, wage slavery, etc, etc -- I've seen it all and it happens.

I have a soft spot for anarcho-syndicalism, but while I want to believe in it I'm not sure it could actually function beyond the small scale.

He turned to the Soviet Union and started spouting Marxist slogans, yes, but only after the US had gotten hostile when he expropriated the property of several large US companies and paid them the value the companies themselves had artificially deflated to avoid paying property taxes. 

Just like Ho in Vietnam, and several East European leaders, Castro was much more of a nationalist - agitation using Marxist slogans became convenient when the US avoided dealing with him while the Soviet Union welcomed him with open arms and offered support and goods (and oil) at artificially low prices (as the Soviet Union did with most of it's allies). 

The Cuban revolutionary movement was in no way unique in taking that approach - a significant part of the success the Soviet Union had in gaining allies during the Cold War were at least indirectly a result of the US refusing to deal with these groups because they stepped on the wrong (corporate) toes.

&gt;The terrible irony of this inevitable cultural shift, is that the Democrats are digging their own grave with these ""stimulus packages""

This is laughable, because the Democrats know these theories work in reality. Many of these things were present between WW2 and Reagan. Furthermore, if you travel at all, you would know that many European Countries are successfully using this model. 

It is the Republicans who are petrified. Their model of ""trickle down"" and low taxes was tested over the past 25 years. It has been a demonstrable failure. Things like barstool economics have long dominated the economical and political discourse, and many now are beginning to realize how naive such ""thought experiments"" are. We live in a complex world, and our economic theory is equally as complex.

&gt;I've seen the data, but I am really interested to know exactly how you think they are accomplishing this. Is it really due to actions of the Fed itself or are other factors in play?

Could be a few things, but it's hard to tell due to the lack of transparency. My guess is the Fed is pulling hard out of the commercial paper industry, and is likely selling securities. They're keeping interest low to encourage lending, but they're mopping it up in different areas. 

&gt;No, we just have different ideas about Justice and Morality. I know this will seem cheesy but this is honestly the best 8 min explanation of my philosophy that I have seen: the philosophy of Liberty Just be sure to mute the terrible music.

But, as in all things, there are ""tipping points"" where the numbers force your hand. for example, you may not be inclined to up and quit your job for a $0.10 raise, but you may do it for a  $5.00 raise. 

Say I'm thinking about starting a tree and landscaping service. I know that for tree work I will need a crew of three workers. To employ a crew full time, I would need to be able to cover all of these workers expenses, as the work they do for me is probably their only source of income. 

My workers would require money for rent, food, clothes, utilities, health care, transportation, *taxes*...

So, when my workers are forced to pay higher taxes, *I have to pay higher wages*.  When I pay a payroll tax for the privilege of employing someone, that is another expense for me to consider.

Soon it becomes apparent that I can't get enough business at the rates I must charge to cover my workers expenses, *let alone my own*.

Since the math didn't work out, I may say ""fuck it"" and not even venture into the tree and landscaping business. Three jobs were *not* created, and nobody even notices. 

Multiply that by the thousands of other on-the-fence entrepreneurs and you have a big deal...how big of a deal? 

Look at the telephone directory. Notice the thickness of the yellow pages compared to the thickness of the white pages. Open to any random yellow page, and *notice all the small listings*.  Thats where the heart of the American economy lies. 

Give tax breaks to workers and they will have more of their own money to spend. Give tax breaks to small employers and the math may work out better.

this is a pocketbook issue.  

Right now, our pocketbooks are being picked by the money-changers and the tax man to pay for things we really dont want any part of, like a global military empire. 735+ military bases around the globe. (!!!)

WHY are we in Germany? WHY are we in Japan?  

We are struggling to get by and our pockets are picked to prop up a web of garrisons in places where they are not welcome, like saudi arabia !?!? Are we surprised that a few ""fringe"" members of their society take exception to our boot-prints on their land?

And now we are expected to put up a missile shield in Europe to ""protect"" them from Iranian or Russian ""aggression"". How is this unlike the Cuban Missile Crisis? We are putting our Weapons in their backyard and they may take exception to it like we took exception to Russian Weapons in Cuba.

Americans can't afford the arms race. neither could the USSR, who learned a little too late. If the European states are concerned enough, they will build their own missile shield. Of course they may opt not to, knowing their own ""aggression"" will likely be responded to tit-for-tat escalating a wasteful arms race.

For instance large amounts of visible pollution in a city in China could block out sunlight and make that area cooler while the global average still increases. It is also theorized by some that if enough ice melts from Greenland the warm ocean currents will be hindered and areas of Europe will become colder. This difference in effects on the local scale is why climate change is a favored term over global warming, because it does not lead everyone to believe that their location will simply become warmer and because local effects are not as well understood or forecast as global ones. 

The reason 2008 was cooler than other recent years was because of a strong la nina, which is not attributed to human impacts (the ENSO cycle is still not completely understood but cycles fairly regularly and shows up in newer climate models though not explicitly programmed in). The cooling for 2008 was predicted and well understood in the scientific community (professors told me about it a year ago and said it would sadly provide fodder for global warming deniers) but is not blamed on human activity.

It's nearly impossible to carry out research on scheduled drugs. Even licensed scientists, such as [Alexander Shulgin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin), have had their labs raided after publishing material that the government doesn't like. Barring compounds from study makes it virtually impossible to voice any dissident opinion, because no concrete evidence can be produced contrary to propaganda. Thus, the laws themselves become justified because the proof is lopsided and there's no way around it. 

Cannabinoids are virtually the safest molecules we know of. For medical or recreational use, the only adverse effects seem to be impaired working memory while under the influence and/or undesired feelings. Research should be encouraged, not hindered. Studies have shown THC and other cannabinoids to be [neuroprotective](http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/21/17/6475) and [anti-tumoral](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17952650?ordinalpos=1&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_Discovery_RA&amp;linkpos=1&amp;log$=relatedreviews&amp;logdbfrom=pubmed).

It even [fights it](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070417193338.htm).

Further evidence for the potential medical applications of cannabinoids stems from a failed anti-obesity drug, [Rimonabant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimonabant), which made it to the European market and to the FDA approval process before being pulled from the shelves. I have a wall of text analyzing the importance of this failed drug [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Marijuana/comments/7ti99/drug_opposite_of_thc_a_disaster_points_toward/c07cxcg) for those who are interested.

From Forbes.com:

(1744-1812) Meyer Amschel Rothschild:
Meyer Amschel Rothschild helped invent modern banking by introducing concepts such as diversification, rapid communication, confidentiality and high volume. The superlatively discreet foreign-exchange banker diversified from the very beginning, selling antiques and procuring loans. Remarkably, Rothschild was willing to cut into his own profits in order to secure future business.
And, earlier than most, he understood that time and information meant money, and he pulled out all the stops to remain in constant contact with associates across Europe. That network came in handy when he helped finance England's war effort during the Napoleonic Wars. Rothschild institutionalized his bank with a far-sighted will that ensured the continuation of his business. Considered a founding father of international finance, his banking empire--thanks to his five sons--had expanded to London, Paris, Vienna and Naples at the time of his death.

And I don't think it helps anyone except for politically-active religious (mostly Christian) evangelicals who are interested in confusing the issue at stake between themselves and atheists.  

Do evangelical Christians *really* care about the difference between atheists and agnostics (or even non-evangelical Christians) who are strongly against the mixing of church &amp; state (e.g. people who think that freedom *from* religion is a necessary part of freedom *of* religion)?  I really doubt it.  I think it's far more likely that evangelical Christians would wish to lump all these people together into the same group.

I mean... anyone can have immutable certainty about any number of things.  Like... I'm pretty sure I could qualify as a gravity fundamentalist under this definition.  Well?  What is that supposed to signify?  Not much.

Evangelical Christians are well aware that the term ""fundamentalist"" has negative connotations and are interested in diffusing the power of that word by applying it to their political enemies.  The same attempt is at the kernel of making straight-line comparisons between Stalin &amp; Pol Pot versus centuries of pogroms against European Jews, the genocidal colonization of the Americas, the Crusades &amp; the Spanish Inquisition (to name a few).  The most obvious difference is that the former group's evil behavior was limited to only one generation.  

One of the main ways in which Christianity was able to maintain its multi-generational evil behavior was through doing away with the separation of church and state.  Again, we see that this is the main goal of today's evangelical Christians.  Confusing the issue of fundamentalism by labeling both sides as such covers up the modernity-resisting, female subjugating social aspects that are dominant in any fundamentalist version of any religion - which are its main traits.

What do they teach you kids in school?  The earth has only on a few instances been cooler than it is today.  It has frequently been **much** warmer.  Once upon a time temperate forests reached into the arctic circle.

&gt; [The climate became warm and humid world-wide towards the Eocene boundary, with subtropical vegetation growing in Greenland and Patagonia, crocodiles swimming off the coast of Greenland, and early primates evolving in tropical palm forests of northern Wyoming[1]. The Earth's poles were cool and temperate; North America, Europe, Australia and southern South America were warm and temperate; equatorial areas had tropical climates; and north and south of the equatorial areas, climates were hot and arid.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene#Climate)

* Stop doing what you're doing now and go get the highest paying job possible. Only the hot women flock to alpha males. A lot of women want a replacement for their dads, emotionally. If you're looking for a chick to replace mommy, you can hang that one up unless you dig dating older women.

* Club regularly, but dress in a sportcoat and business casual, and just chill out and don't dance unless asked. Go with friends from work and buy people drinks. Eventually chicks will recognize you because of how often you go to the club, see you're the guy with the cash, and start talking.

* Stay out of strip clubs. They're depressing, suck your money, and get you absolutely nowhere.

* Try to get a job that has travel abroad.

* Get a trainer and learn to golf as good as you can. It's going to be one way to get ahead in this world. And pretend like you like it, when you probably won't.

* Keep up with European football and pretend to like it. You'll have something to discuss with your European friends and clients.

* Drive the nicest, roomiest Toyota you can -- the upgrade model. It might be the only car company still around in the future. It also saves you money and gas mileage versus a Mercedes. And you'll have a vehicle that chicks will be slightly impressed with, versus, say, a used Buick or a Ford Exploder.

* Always look your finest and keep things clean. Chicks dig that.

* Always date women younger than you. As you get older, keep dating younger and younger women.

* Work out like crazy. Hire a trainer. Don't become an overgrown oaf, though.

* Force yourself to save 20% to 30% of your income in a well- diversified account. If you can't do that, then you're not earning enough cash.

* Hire someone to build a log cabin, or bring out the man in yourself and build one yourself with some contractors or buddies, using a kit. It will be a great place to getaway to, or perhaps live.

* The goal is to get rich as fast as possible and retire at age 45.

If nuclear proliferation is the issue, then that can be dealt with by requiring disclosure and inspections. Perhaps we could require any purchasing nation to relinquish the right to have nuclear weapons and prove it to the UN and the rest of the world. Thus, open source spacecraft could be a tool of nuclear disarmament, making the world safer in the process.

I think you might be surprised how many people would let you periodically look around their homes for an iPhone. Manned spaceflight is one of the capabilities that causes a nation to stand out as more capable than their peers. I believe many nations would take advantage of access to space if it were affordable and less risky.

As far as monetarizing an open source design, software companies do it all the time. While it might be possible for a nation to manufacture every single component of a complex rocket design, most would opt to purchase the components from the manufacturers with experience and a track record and then assemble them.

By open sourcing the American design, we have some control of how human access to space will evolve. Otherwise, Russia, China, Europe or some private concern will be able in part or in whole to determine how human access to space is accomplished, perhaps in ways America is not happy or comfortable with.

The Arab birthrate is also on the decline as more Arab women, particularly the Israeli ones are going out to study and work while Jewish Haredim are at it like rabbits. As for exiled Palestinians, they probably won't come into question, even the majority of the ""home based"" Palestinians are but imports of the British who were trying to quell early Jewish immigration, particularly after the holocaust. A One State option discussion would touch on this factor plus many more, such as confiscated Jewish properties in Arab states, compensation for wars, water... in fact, because of all these factors, there will be no discussion. People will continue to wank off to the Two State solution.

Which brings me to this, Jews in the general, both the secular majority and religious minority feel Israel is their homeland, which is a historical fact but fraught with complications in ""international law"" which btw just an academic discipline that employs a few 100 people, and nothing more. The current borders of the State of Israel are confined to what was a much larger Judea, so we don't feel like we've got a good deal. Consider; the Sinahlese people in Sri Lanka feel the Tamil people who moved in over the passed few hundred years shouldn't be there, but at the same time acknowledge that they're there to stay, yet they still don't want to concede fully to Tamil demands for independence. So it's a bit of stalemate, over time things will fall into place. Likewise we're not gunna see Scotland fight for independence as well as [all these other regions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation#Examples_of_annexation_after_1948), nor will Germany get Alsace where the EU sits back from France who pinched it after WWI as compensation for the war, etc.

If time does its work in Israel and OTs, all we have left to deal with is the age old culture of a people whose religion is possibly the main factor in what is called the ""Middle East conflict"" or what have you. Well actually, time can't do its work, so long the former dhimmis Jews are free and indipendant, there will be hatred, resentment and religious zeal. The Arab community has to sort out it's act, Jews innately don't hate Arabs even though some of us had a rough ride in their lands with their tribal wars over the passed 2k years.

About Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other such orgs obviously radical Islamic movements would not be integrated into Israel.

I feel the exact same way when people use ""gay"" or ""retarded"" when they mean that something is stupid.  I'm not a p.c. nazi; in fact I hate most of the p.c. crap that goes around. I'm not a European American, they're not African Americans; I'm white and that dark skinned guy over there is black.  

But I grew up in the south. I used to see every day how people used the word ""nigger"" to denigrate and make people feel less than human.  I used to see the anger then futility and hopelessness that came to my friend's eyes when someone used that word around him.  Oh, but he was intelligent and well off, so he must not have been offended, right?  He wasn't ""one of those,"" so people felt free talk about that other group around him.

I sat next to my other friend a few days ago as she tried to nicely describe the pain of growing up with a developmentally disabled brother to a friend because said friend had called her a ""fucking retard"" for not liking a certain band.  And she tried not to make him feel guilty as she explained that clinically, her brother was classified as ""mentally retarded,"" and maybe the word ""retarded"" wasn't the best choice to use in the way he did.

And I'm pretty sure the vast majority of people have grown up with a gay friend, and have seen the pain they've gone through with first admitting it to themselves, then to other people. Being called a fag is horrible, but I can't imagine it's any worse than when you hear a friend casually say, ""That movie was so gay, dude.""  When they state that a part of who you are, ""gay,"" is a synonym for stupid or moronic.  That the thing that shamed you for so long SHOULD be shameful, because people associate ""gay"" with something hateful.

I think it's great if you've never been hurt by something someone has said.  But most of the people I've met have been. I'm a super sensitive douche, so I get hurt about once a minute.  And so when people use the word ""wigger"" so casually, a word that is directly descended from ""white nigger,"" and yet that very same person can't bring him/herself to even WRITE the word ""nigger,"" that's a problem for me. Because they must know the heft that that word has. But they use it anyway.

Words have power. We all know that. That's actually pretty much the point of reddit. And when you chose to ignore that, and bandy about offensive and hurtful words, that makes you a dick.

What was remarkable was he was a dot on the   horizon swimming way off the coast - I looked cause tourists were oowing and aahing and pointing at this dot - a marathon swimming dog I   found out after some brief questioning and investigation. Said dog came sharply into focus when I finally got to look through a telescope   that I had to que and pay for to use - his easy movement through the water reminded me of Johnny Weissmuller at his best. I convinced my wife   to trek with me down the long prominade that curved way off into the distance finally ending in park land - primarily to try and follow the   trajectory of the dog, I wanted to see this dog, he'd pique my interest totally.  A rapid walk and 15 minutes later we were in the park area. As we slackened our pace I watched the dog amazed, he was coming our way but   still a ways off. I turned to say something to my wife and was suprised to see her features frozen in total suprise, her index finger   pointing down towards the rocky terrain and the sea, some 75 yards off. ""It's you she screeched!"" I looked to where her finger pointed...   There was a man below shouting towards the dog. My wife's disbelief increased as we quickly closed the gap between this hollering man and   ourselves. Sure enough this man and me looked pretty similar I was stunned and silent, we could have almost been twins  but he was a good   deal younger than me.  As the dog finally neared, the man clapped with enthusiasm and finally  he threw a ball. The dog, a Golden Retriever, eased effortlessly up   through some fierce foaming, breaking waves and collected the ball and was then quickly out and up the rocky slope - the man cheering and   whooping in delight. ""Toby,the champion, the man, the king, the best..."" he waxed over and over I remember it exactly, the candice and rhythm    of his voice. He passed us without showing us the slightest bit of attention, his focus was wholly, totally and complety on Toby the dog. I   was too startled to say anything, the moment passed as they did, up the park, through the trees and into the distance. And there it was, an   amazing dog and my twin. So there the story lay, incomplete. That is until a few days ago. By chance, coincidence or luck I happeded upon the video above.Unmistakably   Toby.

Prove it.

Your ""real world"" example is not an example of the free market.

&gt;Free market capitalism doesn't reward progress and prosperity, it rewards winning.

Prove it.

&gt;It also suffers from the tragedy of the commons problem.

You don't know what the tragedy of the commons entails.  The tragedy of the commons exists when the government prevents private ownership of whatever resource is under consideration.

The oceans for example are not allowed to be privately owned.  The governments of the world forbid it.  This causes fishermen to fish as much as they can with the time they are allocated.  They do not suffer losses on account of decreased fish counts.  Same thing with the forests.  Many forests of the world are not allowed to be privately owned.   Loggers therefore have no incentive to replace trees.  In Europe, many forests are privately owned, and they are not depleted to nothing because the owners have an incentive to replace trees as they are cut down.

The tragedy of the commons is not specific to capitalism.  It is actually specific to government regulated economies,

&gt;Free market proponents would tell you to just privatize the field so that farmers have to pay for the use and solve the problem. That might work on a field, but not for, say, the atmosphere.

The atmosphere cannot be owned because it cannot be put under the control of any person.  See Menger's definition of economic goods.

&gt;It also causes two additional problems. First, everything has to be owned. There can be no public resources. Second, those who lose at the competition lose access.

Your first point shows the legitimacy of capitalism.  Your second point shows that those who satisfy consumers the best get control of economic resources, as it should be.  We don't want morons handling scarce resources, we want good people handling them

&gt;In other words, the rich get richer and poor get poorer, which we see.

Capitalism is characterized by countless examples of penniless newcomers becoming millionaires.

The reason the rich are getting richer and the poorer are getting poorer is not due to capitalism.  It is due to our monetary system, where credit expansion enters the economy in places that benefit the rich and hurt the poor.

&gt;There is no safety net.

Yes there is.  There is private charity.

&gt;If your business fails, you literally die because you can feed yourself or family.

What bullshit!  Firms go bankrupt all the time.  The people don't die.  They simply become workers themselves.  Stop lying.

&gt;And keep in mind that it's not the ""better"" business that wins in the sense of creating progress and prosperity, it is the one that ""wins"" the best meaning lies, cheats, steals, etc., best.

In our current system that is true.  But in unregulated free market capitalism, it is *not* true.  During the industrial revolution, we had hardly any regulations, yet we had the fastest economic growth in the history of mankind.

&gt;Your problem is that you confuse regulation with socializing. 

No, they are different.  Regulation is supposed to be about ensuring that businesses don't break the law.  Socialism is when the government takes control of the means of production, as we are seeing today.  The government now has equity stakes in the banks.  That is socialism.

&gt;What should be socialized are things that make a safety net that allow people to take risks on innovation, as well as infrastructure that allows them compete upon.

Who decides *that*?

&gt;Monopolies are far from impossible in a free market. They are inevitable. All it takes is a single company to get far enough ahead of other companies that it can afford to put them all out of business.

If they get far enough ahead of other companies, then they should be allowed to keep growing.

&gt;It can do this by selling at a loss for longer than they can or by using its market position to pressure others not to use the other companies, or from retailers from selling competing products, or many other means that do not include producing a better product.

They can't sell at a loss just to gain market share, because their gains will always be less than their losses they sustained by selling below costs.  There is no incentive for firms to sell at a loss for any length of time just to gain market share.  It doesn't pay.  It's why companies don't do it now.

&gt;For example, suppose someone came up with a better operating system than Windows, but Microsoft had agreements with all of the major computer retailers to only sell Windows on their computer products (and give them a discount), how would that OS company ever get into the market?

By doing what Apple OS and Linux did.

&gt;In order for the ideological free market case to work, the better OS company would be relying on their partner company also producing as good a computer or better than the market leaders, which violates the whole free market ideology in the first place.

The only ideology is your ideology of regulating the market.  If people acted peacefully, society would be characterized by a free market.  The free market is the only natural society for man.  Any deviation from it requires violence and coercion.

&gt;That's why anti-competition regulations are needed. Improved products and productivity need to be rewarded, not winning.

Actually, ""anti-competition""  regulations are designed to benefit the large businesses at the expense of the smaller businesses who are a threat.  They are not designed to help the little guy.  They are designed to fuck the little guy.

&gt;You are correct that innovation is rewarded in a totally free market, as I said too, but it is only one of many things that are rewarded and it is one of the riskiest to rely on. Crushing the competition through other means is easier.

The only thing holding competition back is using physical force.  In a free market, an economy devoid of force, any large company is subject to competition from the smallest competitor in totality.  Unfortunately, morons like you want regulations, and these regulations always end up benefitting the large corporations at the expense of the smaller businesses.  It's called regulatory capture, and you had better learn about it.

&gt;You also didn't give a single reason why lying, cheating, and other nasty behaviour is punished

It is punished by the guilty losing market share, being jailed for fraud, etc.

&gt;The typical answer is that customers go elsewhere, but that assumes that (a) they know, (b) they care, and (c) they care enough to pay more.

If the consumers don't care, then there is nothing to worry about.

&gt;The problem with typical ideological free market examples is that they assume absolute knowledge.

On the contrary.  The ideology of interventionists is that the government and the regulators have absolute knowledge.  See Hayek and his Nobel Prize winning theory that central economic planning fails precisely because they do not have absolute knowledge, which interventionists like you think they have,

Pro-capitalists never claim that the market has absolute knowledge.  What they do claim, correctly, is that the market is the *best* at not only processing information, but creating information through the mechanism of price discovery.

&gt;Evolution has already demonstrated this in all social animals. From socializing basic needs and altruism via the ""tit-for-tat"" solution to competitive transactions, to individual competition layered on top of that, it's all there. 

Tit-for-tat is free market capitalism.

&gt;Prosperity is maximized by definition though evolution and the winning solutions to maximize prosperity are there for us to look at.

This sentence makes zero sense.

&gt;I find it amusing when people think they are smarter than evolution at figuring out how to maximize prosperity.

Isn't that what you are doing by advocating for business regulation?

&gt;BTW, saying ""your post is refuted"" does not actually make it true. It's a silly comment to make.

Your post is refuted.  Again.

As a bit of an amateur historian I like articles like this and have been trying to think of other battles that could be added to this list.   The only ones I can come up with are [Battle of Marathon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Marathon) and [Battle of Salamis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Salamis) -- which are both part of the [Greco–Persian Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Persian_Wars).

The other one I came up with is the [Siege of Vienna](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Vienna) in 1529, but that is part of the conflict between the Austrians and Ottomans as was the later Battle of Vienna and Lepanto. 

The only place I could see where a good addition might be able to be found is from the period of the [Mongol incursions into Eastern  Europe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasion_of_Europe).

Telling both sets of parents that both of them have been victims of an injustice and they will have to share the kids is in my mind the best outcome.  The kids grow up without living a lie and both set of parents get to be with the kids.  Of course the new parents have to give up the exclusivity they thought they had with them, but let’s face it – that’s exactly the situation the birth parents found themselves in.

Kids do not have an automatic right to being shielded from all the injustices of life no matter what the effect on grown ups - its just nonsense to suggest otherwise. Kids get upset when relatives die, parents or even the family pet dies.  They cope - they get over it and they adapt.  That’s what they can do in this situation.

These parents should get a good legal mind on the case and pursue it in the European human rights courts.

you're obviously a sunni arab, (which i respect and have nothing against)

NO im not a shiite, im an atheist like lots of people in iran who u accuse of doing that shit in ashura (lol 75%?!)

Iran didn't ""CLAIM"" bahrain ... it was an official part of iran, for thousands of years,
and the fact that arabs live in there and are shiites had nothing to do with it, we have a huge population of iranian-arabs living in iran as well, the iranian nationality has nothing to do with race, relegion or colour of the skin

Go read all the official documents about bahrain before it was cut of iran not so long ago

&gt;For five years prior to 1925 the gold price was managed downward to the pre-war level, causing deflation throughout those countries of the British Empire and Commonwealth using the Pound Sterling. But the rise in demand for gold for conversion payments that followed the similar European resumptions from 1925 to 1928 meant a further rise in demand for gold relative to goods and therefore the need for a lower price of goods because of the fixed rate of conversion from money to goods. Because of these price declines and predictable depressionary effects, the British government finally abandoned the standard September 20, 1931.

Of course metals have been currency for a long time.  Before we had any standard, there was bartering.  Standards improve over time.

Why couldn't we have a government backed currency before modern times?  For a few reasons:

* Most governments back thousands of years ago were extremely unstable.  Civil war, or invasion would end a currency.

&gt;the Federal Reserve is not obliged to tie the dollar to anything. It can print as much or as little money as it deems appropriate. There are powerful advantages to such an unconstrained system.

Yes, and that power is misused, and causes the business cycle.

&gt;To take only one example, that flexibility is the reason the stock market crash of 1987--which started out every bit as frightening as that of 1929--did not cause a slump in the real economy.

The crash of 1987 was caused by previous inflation from the Fed.  The Fed did not stop the crash by printing money.  It only delayed the correction to the future, and a part of that crash is being felt now in the form of a weaker economy.

&gt;Over the past five years, the dollar has been worth as much as 120 yen and as little as 80. The costs of this volatility are hard to measure (partly because sophisticated financial markets allow businesses to hedge much of that risk), but they must be significant.

Why do you think derivatives were invented in the first place?  For fun?  Derivatives became more widespread because inflation and deflation became more widespread.

&gt;Furthermore, a system that leaves monetary managers free to do good also leaves them free to be irresponsible--and, in some countries, they have been quick to take the opportunity. That is why countries with a history of runaway inflation, like Argentina, often come to the conclusion that monetary independence is a poisoned chalice.

Argentina could not export their inflation because they don't have the world's reserve currency.

&gt;By establishing a fixed rate of exchange between currencies--or even adopting a common currency--nations can eliminate the uncertainties of fluctuating exchange rates; and a country with a history of irresponsible policies may be able to gain credibility by association. 

Ya, they tried that after the war, and it collapsed within a year.

&gt;On the other hand, what happens if two nations have joined their currencies, and one finds itself experiencing an inflationary boom while the other is in a deflationary recession?

The first thing to do is to not look at this in the neo-classical equilibrium framework.  The difference between one country that is in an inflationary boom and another that is in a deflationary recession is that of *time*.  The country in a deflationary recession must have gone through an inflationary boom prior to the recession, and the country that is currently in an inflationary boom is going to go through a deflationary bust later on as the malinvestments are corrected.

Obviously the cause for both scenarios is the inflationary monetary system itself.  A gold standard is immune to such deflationary busts because it is immune to inflationary booms.

&gt;Then the monetary policy that is appropriate for one is exactly wrong for the other.

On the contrary, the appropriate monetary policy that is appropriate to both is to stop inflation for good.  The only way to ensure that inflation will not take place is to have a 100% reserve gold standard.

&gt;These ambiguities explain why economists are divided over the wisdom of Europe's attempt to create a common currency

It's also why there are still booms (inflation) and busts (deflation/depression) even after the creation of the fiat monetary systems that were supposed to have stopped recessions.

&gt;I personally think that it will lead, on average, to somewhat higher European unemployment rates; but many sensible economists disagree.

Of course you do, because you are a Keynesian who thinks that lower prices makes unemployment rise.  You base this on the ridiculous notion that people are prepared to consume only a maximum *physical* amount, and therefore if prices fall, then people will spend less, and therefore unemployment will rise.  You obviously don't consider the truth, which is that total spending is determined by the supply of money, which means if prices fall, then more goods and services will be sold, leaving revenues unchanged, and hence debt will not be harder to pay back, and business profitability will stay positive, and thus unemployment will not rise.

Keynesians reject the quantity theory of money because it is the monkey wrench that actually destroys the whole Keynesian paradigm of the ""unemployment equilibrium"", government deficits, and inflation.

&gt;First, a gold standard would have all the disadvantages of any system of rigidly fixed exchange rates--and even economists who are enthusiastic about a common European currency generally think that fixing the European currency to the dollar or yen would be going too far.

You know someone has no idea what they are talking about when they claim this fallacy as truth.  If all the countries of the world are on a gold standard, *then there are no fixed gold exchange rates*.  All the various gold backed paper monies would be equal to each other, they will just mean different weights of gold.  For example, if 1 USD is 1/35 ounce of gold, and 1 Euro is 1/20 ounce of gold, then the ""exchange rate"" between the USD and the Euro is *not* ""fixed"" in the ratio of 1/35 to 1/20.  The exchange rate does not exist because they are simply two different quantities of gold, and these two quantities are given different names.  The ""name"" for 1/35 ounces is ""1 USD"".  The ""name"" for 1/20 ounces is ""1 Euro"".  

If two people get together, and one of them has 1/35 ounces of gold, and the other has 1/20 ounces of gold, then they can't just exchange their gold and be in the same position.  The guy with the initially  lower gold balance will gain at the expense of the guy with the initially higher gold balance.  In order for any trade of gold to be equal, the guy who has less gold is going to have to get an additional 1/20 - 1/35 ounces of gold, in other words, he is going to have to give more ""USD"" fractions.

To call this a ""fixed exchange rate"" is to mistake the nature of a gold standard.  Under a gold standard, *gold is money*.  Krugman makes the mistake of thinking that paper is still the standard, and therefore if two different countries label their units of currency two different weights of gold, then there must be some sort of ""fixed exchange"" rate between the two currencies.  

The fact is that there is no exchange rate because both countries are using gold.  There is no exchange rate between gold and gold.  Well, there is, but it is unity.

&gt;Second, and crucially, gold is not a stable standard when measured in terms of other goods and services.

Money doesn't ""measure"" goods and services.  It is a means of exchanging goods and services for other goods and services.

&gt;On the contrary, it is a commodity whose price is constantly buffeted by shifts in supply and demand that have nothing to do with the needs of the world economy--by changes, for example, in dentistry.

The ""needs"" of the world's economy is a stable money.  Gold is the most stable money there is.  Even taking into account the various consumption uses for gold, like dentistry, electronics, and jewelry, the uses of gold for these consumption purposes *is actually what gives a money its ULTIMATE value*.  If something should happen that shocks the economy, then the fact that gold is useful in consumption will make gold spontaneously remonetize itself as people seek to trade for it in commerce.

&gt; The United States abandoned its policy of stabilizing gold prices back in 1971.

That's because the Fed inflated the US dollar too much to defend a $35 an ounce exchange rate, which made other countries seek to exchange their US dollars for US held gold.  This made the gold supply in the US shrink until the government Fed could no longer defend the dollar against gold.  The year 1971 is actually the year the US declared bankruptcy.  It has been bankrupt ever since.  The rest of the world is also bankrupt.

&gt;Since then the price of gold has increased roughly tenfold, while consumer prices have increased about 250 percent. If we had tried to keep the price of gold from rising, this would have required a massive decline in the prices of practically everything else--deflation on a scale not seen since the Depression.

No Mr. Krugman, wrong again.  You can't just take the abandonment of the gold standard, and the consequent rise in its paper money price that invariably took place as dollars are printed, to be the yardstick from which to judge how much deflation is needed to defend the old exchange rate!  The reason the price of gold started to rise was because gold was no longer money.  Paper was the new money.  The price of gold did not rise, it was the paper that declined in value relative to the relatively more stable amount of gold that existed.  Once Nixon abandoned gold, the USD became the world's reserve currency.  Since then, gold has become an investment and a consumption good.  If the price of gold rises, it is a good indicator that the USD is being printed.  You can't then say that the only way to defend the old gold exchange rate is through massive deflation.  The inflation took place because gold is no longer money!

Is it just me or is Krugman really not as smart as everyone thinks he is?  This is basic stuff here.

And what about when universal assent actually takes us further away from the truth?  Medieval Europeans believed that there were lands below the equator known as the Antipodes, but that they could not be reached because they lie on the other side of a zone so hot that humans could not cross it.  I've seen no indication that there were Europeans who dissented on that point, so the Antipodes were confirmed, for all practical purposes, by universal assent.  But they were wrong -- the Antipodes *were* reachable, even in their day.  How do we protect against that sort of stultification by common assent?

I doubt that we even have a way of judging what answers would be most assimilable to objective fact.  So even when the idea is simply to approach objectivity, the problem is that we have no way of knowing whether we're getting closer or farther away.

&gt;Unless for some reason, someone thinks that morality would be better if it was entirely subjective (I'd like to see such an argument).

I wouldn't say better, but given that we aren't capable of an objective morality, I would say that it's more practical to look at ways of incorporating awareness of our subjectivity into our moral judgment, rather than behaving as though we *were* after all, capable of objective knowledge of moral standards.

As for an argument in favor of a purely subjective basis for moral judgment, you might try Hannah Arendt's essay entitled ""Personal Responsibility Under Dictatorship"".  It's included in the recent anthrology of her moral essays, *Responsibility and Judgment*.

&gt; Religious beliefs aren't always positive. Atheism is a religious belief.

That's a jargoned way to talk about it.  The phrase ""eligious beliefs"" can refer to beliefs *about* religion and beliefs *that make one* religious.

I agree, but I think that trying to incorporate subjectivity is just as problematic as trying to incorporate objectivity because subjectivity will lead in different directions (while objectivity leads towards one unreachable destination).

Do you think the earth is round? Universal assent (due to science) should lead to this being *close to* objectively true, but with a simple brain-in-vat thought experiment, this could be proved to be false. If you don't think that consensus leads to a high degree of objectivity, then you're going to condemn yourself to saying ""to the best of my knowledge"" concerning any kind of statement about the natural world.

&gt; If they're self-contradictory they are. And if subjectivity negates sociality, then sociality is self-contradictory since it always refers to the interaction between subjective agents. Since you've asserted that sociality is not nonsense, that must mean that subjectivity doesn't actually negate sociality.

I never said sociality is not nonsense, just that it's not an illusion. Cars are real and cars exist, but the concept of a ""car"" is inconsistent.

&gt; Would we? Evolutionary psychologists like Richard Wright have argued that social behavior is evolved, essentially hardwired. Given that, there's no reason to suppose that we couldn't sustain some brand of sociality without morality. I think it's at least worth entertaining the notion that morality does something more than simply regulate social behavior.

I don't disagree that morality exists particular to preserve our species, but I was just saying hypothetically if one day we all realize that morality was inconsistent, we'd have a hard time reconciling this with how we feel/act. It's hard for me to imagine sociality without morality for beings that make value judgments. And it's even harder for me to imagine people who don't make value judgments.

Do you think that it's possible to have a society without value judgments? Also, before answering that, do you agree that value judgments are an inherent part of morality?

Food stockpiles are down in many areas and we saw prices jump drastically during the past year. Further, I wouldn't say that higher quality food is particularly plentiful and inexpensive. Cheeseburgers are cheap and bountiful but have you seen the price for veggies and milk recently?

I hate talking about food, especially when contrasting high quality and low quality foods because it is a slippery slope which leads to the USDA, the corn/farm lobby and massive subsidies for US farmers.  But you're right, HQ veggies/food is more expensive that cheap, processed unhealthy food.

Finding data on food consumption vs. production and yearly reserves is a pain.  In my brief search I see that some stockpiles are down (wheat is at 50-60 yr lows) and others are up (milk/milk powder).  Grocery stores are maintaining adequate supply and restaurants aren't running out of supply either.  At this point, supply of food has little to do with the across the board increases in food prices.  Energy costs have been a much more important factor.  I assume that we can drive down US food costs considerably by forcing a greater percentage of food to remain as domestic supply however; the industry will not do this voluntarily.  The US food needs are being met and there is more money to be made with prices at their current level by exporting to the world market.  Cheaper prices and increased US supply do not equal increased US consumption and does not equal increased US payroll in the context of the food sector.  But as you’ve suggested, lower prices leave more money available for other expenditures in other areas and I’m getting to that. :)

&gt; I don't think managed protectionism will have a positive effect. Trade restrictions destroy the comparative advantage of another entity thus making everyone worse off. If protectionism worked, North Korea would be the most prosperous countries in the world not one of the poorest.

&gt; One of the most effective ways to help the domestic system would be to relax trade restrictions and regulations which would enhance the 3 necessary conditions for economic growth: private property rights, the ability to voluntarily transfer private property, and a sound currency.

If we consider needs supplies and trade restrictions/regulations are further relaxed, commodities like sugar could saturate the US market and severely impact US corn farmers.  Sugar consumption would naturally increase but at the cost of a domestic industry and domestic jobs as corn syrup use decreases due to a cheaper, competitive good.  Worldwide sweetener production can be expected to remain flat.  Sugar production could ramp up; corn syrup would ramp down because US consumers, per capita, will not eat more sweetener product just because the supply has shifted from corn syrup to sugar.  Conversely, consumers in Europe might find sugar costs increase as supply is shifted to the US.

If we consider wants supplies and trade restrictions/regulations are further relaxed, there is the potential for imported want goods to become cheaper and therefore have a larger market.  This could create a situation where the want becomes a need.  I think the personal computer is a good example.  In the US, we consider the computer to be a need.  Largely, this need is produced overseas by foreign companies.  Dell, Gateway, HP and others conduct final assembly here, but that is a small portion of the computers manufacturing life.  Conversely, Apple products could get cheaper.  However, I find fault in the suggestion that less trade restriction would generally benefit the US economy. In the computer example, the bulk percentage of revenue from the computer sale makes it over seas.  Lessening trade restrictions doesn’t increase the percentage revenue that stays stateside, especially if the lax trade restrictions encourage additional outsourcing of assembly due to comparative advantage.
There are probably trade examples which counter what I mention and I’m interested to here your thoughts.

I certainly don’t propose intense, protectionist policies, but I do think that the existing trade policies warrant critical analysis.  If stimulus is proposed to benefit business, I think it is important that those receiving funds are encouraged to allow the dollars to cycle within US borders to the greatest extent possible.  As you said, the monies don’t stimulate the US industrial economy if we allow them to be sent to foreign companies.

I apologize for the long discussion set-up; it helped me to clarify my thoughts.  I don’t think that Say’s Law is complete bunk.

The World is overpopulating. But it is overpopulating unevenly: poor and uneducated people and countries having many children and well-educated middle-class ones have too few children. Especially here in Europe.

If you have a college degree and you and your spouse make over, well, say, $50K, please DO have 2-3 children, don't do the usual contemporary trick of going for 1 child at the last possible age, at about 36 (for the woman). You can give a lot to that child, and a well-educated child is a great gift to the world.

OTOH of course, if you are poor and uneducated, please don't have 14 children, have 2 or 3, because yes, the author is right, you are condemning them to a horrible life.

Who's equating shit? Not me. Morality is entirely subjective. Back in the 1800's it was perfectly moral to enslave blacks and lynch them if they slighted a white man. This was done both in the South *and* North. And who are these ""two people who have made completely opposite ideological positions""? You really think every white person in the South *chose* to enslave black people? Only a small fraction of whites in the South even *owned* slaves. And even so, it wasn't Southerners who decided to introduce slavery into the economy. That was the work of European empires. 

&gt;have a little of your own medicine

Bringing up the Civil Rights movement doesn't do anything to disprove my point that racism is indeed everywhere. Just because the South used to be full of some pretty racist people who resorted to violence doesn't mean the North had *no* racists in it. You seem to be stuck on the idea that racism only exists in the South because of slavery and the civil rights movement. But I guess that's just a reflection of your government approved education. You clearly aren't capable of thinking for yourself.

&gt;Fuck off

So *angry!* Grrrrr!!!

&gt;the world is a fucked up place

That's what I'm trying to tell you! It's not all black and white. Just because the South looked pretty bad because of slavery doesn't mean the North didn't look bad because of similar racism. Read a mother-fuckin BOOK!

&gt;doesn't rationalize your own personal failings as a human being by attempting to marginalize unpleasant truths with vague generalities.

Let's keep things grammatically correct, please. What ""personal failings"" are you talking about? Could you be more specific? You're being too unpleasant and vague. 

&gt;the South, simply failed to own up to the fact that they chose not to fight it.

You are *so* pathetic. The South came to rely on the institutionalized system of cheap labor for their economy to survive. It's no excuse for their actions to be sure (by today's standards that is) but you can't expect them to willfully ruin themselves by getting rid of their means of production. And do you *really* think the North got rid of slavery? Sure, they no longer held black in bondage because of the color of their skin. They found a better, more acceptable, and more effective means of slavery. Seeing as how they had an abundance of immigrants, they could basically pay them next to nothing to work in horrid conditions, probably worse conditions than any plantation. The trade-off was that they no longer had to look after their slaves' needs for food, shelter, or medical needs. They paid them less than enough to survive and when they succumbed they had someone waiting in line for the job. So you go ahead and tell me what's worse: Southern slavery or Northern Slavery (I'll give you a hint, they're both equally bad because they're basically the same thing).",1234476550,3,3,t5_2qh3l,Mentok

For the last time:  There are NOT ""lots of Indians"" or ""Lots of Chinese"" in the US.  The vast majority of serial killer statistics come from the US and western Europe (for a combined total of 90% of known serial killers), and reflect the populations of those areas adequately.  The stats are the way they are because they only reflect these areas, not because there are no Chinese or Indian serial killers. 

China is not exactly well known for sharing their crime stats (at least not honestly), and most known serial killers there come to us through news/infamy, not statistics kept by their government.

India doesn't spend a lot of money compiling stats, and they don't even jail a lot of people (1 in 30k, compared to 1 in 100 in the US)  This is a country that is largely rural, where people still get away with keeping slaves, so you're making gross assumptions that the lack of statistics means they don't exist.

This is the last I'll try to explain this to you.

""But the question still stands, why are whites more likely to be serial killers.""

No, it doesn't, it never did.

First off... I didn't want to respond to this, because clearly, it was immature, unintelligible, and there was no point. So you'll have to excuse me if my response is equally immature, unintelligible, and pointless.

This is what you sound like:

&gt;Who's equating shit? Not me. Morality is entirely subjective. Back in the 1800's it was perfectly moral to enslave blacks and lynch them if they slighted a white man. This was done both in the South and North. And who are these ""two people who have made completely opposite ideological positions""? You really think every white person in the South chose to enslave black people? Only a small fraction of whites in the South even owned slaves. And even so, it wasn't Southerners who decided to introduce slavery into the economy. That was the work of European empires.

""Everyone was racist back then so it was okay! I'm completely ignorant of the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 and similar measures by other countries as well as the fact that not only was the South culturally backwards compared to most of Western civilization, but also compared to their neighboring states back into pre-American history. I have no idea who William Pitman of Virgina circa 1775 is nor do I honestly know anything really about history of this period. Also because I am a weasel I will instead blame the Europeans for starting the whole thing, thus by some unknown property, absolving the South, ignoring the fact that at this point in time, Britain and Dutch had both abolished slavery, France had defacto abandoned it, and most of the world had started gravitating away from the idea.""

&gt;Bringing up the Civil Rights movement doesn't do anything to disprove my point that racism is indeed everywhere. Just because the South used to be full of some pretty racist people who resorted to violence doesn't mean the North had no racists in it.

""Clearly, my opponent was making the case that only Southern white land owning males could be racist and everyone else is as pure as the driven snow. Since there could be no other possible interpretation of what he's saying, that's what I'll attack him for despite embarrassingly obvious statements he has made that suggest otherwise. While setting up this straw man, I will completely ignore things I have said that could be construed as heavy handed and absolutist such as 'The North was and is every bit as racist as the South.' as clearly what I say simply refers to nuanced intellectual ideas, such as referring to the _capacity_ for xenophobia instead of simply it's external manifestations of hatred. Anyone who thinks otherwise is clearly an idiot for not understanding this. I will also ignore that I myself brought up 1960s segregation as an example of northern racism and deny the point has any relevance when shown evidence that clearly shows that, while universal, racism showed significantly more support in the south.... such that **95%** of the votes against universal rights came from the south when compared to the rest of the Union.""

&gt;You seem to be stuck on the idea that racism only exists in the South because of slavery and the civil rights movement

""I am completely devoid of the ability to recognize irony. Again I will attribute things that weren't said by my opponent nor will I recognize that there are fundamental degrees of racism and simplify my opponents view to mean racism == slavery because this is easier for my tiny brain to grasp and refute. I will not actually come out and say what I believe to be more racist than slavery or opposition to the civil rights movement, nor do I possess the intellectual fortitude to come out and say 'racism today is more nuanced than it's historical context' because I don't have the capacity to explain that living in close proximity to other people creates contentious feelings of opposition which is difficult to process especially when burdened by the culpability of events that happened generations past, but that's hard to say, especially in the same sentence that I'm marginalizing slavery and the civil rights movement because affirmative action didn't get me into Arizona State.""

&gt;I guess that's just a reflection of your government approved education. You clearly aren't capable of thinking for yourself.

""You are clearly an example of our vast Jewish [or possibly liberal, I'm not quite sure which way you lean, wackjob or nutterbutter] conspirators who brainwashed you, and 'da man' is out to get me. This explains why you're stupid and unable to grasp what I'm trying to say. And although I'm not actually articulating any of my thoughts, mostly because a lot of them are from snippets of radio shows that I've heard and things my Dad yells at me while he's drunk, I see no reason to further elucidate my point because, quite frankly, my opponent has shown himself to be retarded. Which is a good thing because clearly there is absolutely no chance he is actually a product of a private conservative Christian school who's written a dissertation on the subject.*""

&gt;You are so pathetic. The South came to rely on the institutionalized system of cheap labor for their economy to survive... you can't expect them to willfully ruin themselves by getting rid of their means of production.

""I am completely ignorant of contemporary economies of that time period which made the transition with relatively less bloodshed and contention, with no negative effect on their economy**. I am also completely unawares of the irony of first railing against my opponent's equating of racism and slavery, then doing _nothing but talk about it_ for the remainder of my post. I will show the same amount of cultural latitude and tolerance I expect from others when I meet with a baby eating tribe of baby eaters.""

&gt;Sure, they no longer held black in bondage because of the color of their skin. They found a better, more acceptable, and more effective means of slavery.

""I am not slowly starting to sound creepier and creepier. People are not inching away from me and starting to lock their car doors.""

&gt;Seeing as how they had an abundance of immigrants, they could basically pay them next to nothing to work in horrid conditions, probably worse conditions than any plantation. The trade-off was that they no longer had to look after their slaves' needs for food, shelter, or medical needs. They paid them less than enough to survive and when they succumbed they had someone waiting in line for the job.

""First off, I am absolutely unawares of the difference between agricultural work and industrial work and will tend to equate the two, I am also ignorant of the South's attempts at instituting slave factories. I have apparently read The Jungle.""

&gt;So you go ahead and tell me what's worse: Southern slavery or Northern Slavery (I'll give you a hint, they're both equally bad because they're basically the same thing).

""I am completely ignorant of the difference between being _enslaved_ and being beholden to a system of governance which allows me to legally petition and enact change in my society. Changes which will 40 years later allow me to earn a living wage, then ironically complain about those wages as being ""slave wages"" while presumably complaining about both government interference and unions.... all while clinging to my gun railing about Obama. I will have most likely, defended CEO bonuses while blaming the UAW for bringing down the Big 3.""

""I will not be able to resist from responding to this post because I have a small penis and feel the need to justify myself online. I will secretly have read every word, while masterbaing then respond
'tl;dr'. I will not get a response. ever.""

There. That should keep you busy.

It's not even 1/100th of the national worth and this is certainly soon to be a depression. I'd rather inflate and have an extended recession than sit by and do nothing till the economy deflates and stalls, which it's sure to do without intervention.

Plus you have to realize the more money we throw in, the more money Europe throws in and the sooner the global market starts moving. 

I say.. we have to deflate or inflate, there is no magic scenario where we dodge the ill effects. We've already deflated enough or almost enough, we should balance the rest of the losses in inflation, which means a couple trillion in buying toxic assets and creating new jobs and other basics. 

If we do nothing we deflate, if we intervene we inflate, but you cannot honestly argue that the markets can handle deflation better than inflation. The markets are made to inflate and basically never deflate. So when deflation happens mass panic follows, inflation is just easier to handle and face it, one or the other or both must happen to fill the debts left behind.

Choosing to do nothing simply does not cost less, it just means you adjust via deflation rather than inflation. 

I do agree that the banks with these toxic assets need to be bought or put down and basically put our of business and their execs effectively blacklisted by any sane investors. 

We should take their assets and spread them out to the banks that didn't fail along with direct loans to those banks. If they won't take the assets we nationalize the banks and sit on the assets until we can sell for a profit. We don't give money to the same assholes that just lost it. We can even create new private banks and move the assets to them, breaking down the banks that were too big to fail into smaller more manageable losses and putting them into lower risk management. 

We spend 2.4 trillion a year in Health Care, which is over twice per person as any comparable nation. So, you do the math, divide that number in half and consider how much most nations would be paying, then take the difference, which is revenue per year, and compare it to stimulus.

Now expand that over 10 years of health care vs one or two stimulus or 30 years of health care vs 4 stimulus. 

It's really not these stimulus and bailouts that you need to wake up and pay attention to, it's all the costs that have been slowly eating away at individual wealth and making the rich richer than ever before. 

You complain about a one time 800b bill.

I complain about 1.2 trillion a year and growing at 10% in excessive health care profits. 

Why can't we drop ideology and just do the math ? A few key changes in the US industries and we'd have all this money and more to pay these losses and a surplus to pay down the national debt as well.

If we'd just switch to a Canadian style health care in the Clinton era, we'd have saved at least 10 trillion dollars by now. You think 800b is so much money, then you bend over for corporate America's price gouging.

Remember good old John McCain suspending his campaign to make sure the bailout went through.

Pelosi ensured the GOP had to vote for the bailout or it couldn't pass. They tried to pull some slick move where they said they would vote and then coordinate a no vote, likely a publicity stunt to try to make it look like the bailout was the Dems bill.

I assume Pelosi expected something like this and thats why the vote was forced on the GOP.

Then the GOP saw their ploy just made them look like idiot flip floppers and they tried to say that Pelosi's partisan comments/insults made them not vote for the bill.. in coordination. 

Between John McCain suspending his race and the GOP getting their feelings hurt by Pelosi, I found it all quite hilarious.

While I hate the idea of Bush and co. having control over the money, I also realize it's part symbolic and out bailout helped spur global bailouts which did seem to stabilize the markets for now. We kicked in 800b and EU kicked in 2.5 trillion and so on and so forth.

Undoubtedly true.

There's little debate that [slavery was abolished elsewhere in the world for economic reasons.](http://www.google.com/search?q=slavery+abolished+economic+reasons&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a)  Or I should say *institutionalized* slavery.  Indeed, underground slavery exists worldwide.  I have little doubt that the South would not have retained slavery forever.  Social pressures would be another reason.  After all, the many northern states abolished slavery even shortly after U.S. presidents were slaveholders.  

The North was certainly the aggressors in the conflict.  The slavery issue aside (as it should be)  the Confederate States were technically the *good guys* in the Civil War.  It was their revolutionary war.  They happened to lose, but that's just the way it goes.  History has spoken on the matter.  Many historians believe the North and South would have reunified later had the South won.  Others say that had the South won, North America would today look more like the EU.  Who knows?

By the way, sharecropping continues today.  Illegal Mexican labor can also be considered slave-ish.  At some point it becomes hard when the definition of slavery gets blurred.

Then *something happened* and the national, state-owned TV station started broadcasting Star Trek: TNG. I don't want to bore anyone with stories of geekosity and mania, but let's just say there was no fucking way to move me from in front of the TV when TNG was on.

Ok, so I'm not an astronaut (yet!), but I do seek out new life and new civilizations, wherever they are to be found. Star Trek gave me ideals and purpose :). I still watch old episodes of TNG from time to time with great joy.

And **lol internet**, here I am almost 20 years later, replying to Wil Wheaton on a public, world-reaching website. Shouldn't the subspace signal have taken 3 days to reach the Enterprise from Starbase 331?

So, yeah, true, I have no idea who or how you are in real life (although I have visited your online persona), but still. I nominate Wil Wheaton for a scifi.reddit interview, with a topic of ""How do you feel about making a difference in the lives of so many people"", seeing as how Star Trek was a first venture into the unknown not only for me, but for a lot of my friends as well.

It's meaningless to complain about people who don't want to work when there are not enough jobs to go around for those who do want.

Britain, as a society, has consistently voted for parties that support providing benefits as a safety net with the full knowledge that benefits will sometimes be abused. Calling it ""theft"" is meaningless when 90+ of the electorate keeps voting for MP's that supports the overall benefits structure. As in most other European countries having the benefits is considered more important than worrying about the people who do abuse it.

You should also keep in mind that there is a difference between unemployment benefits (and in the UK they are a *joke* compared to most of Europe) and social benefits provided to ensure nobody needs to starve or sleep rough, or to protect children. The former *IS* temporary in the UK and most other places. The latter is NOT - we don't consider it acceptable to let people starve even when they don't want to work, and especially not when there are children involved.

Yes!  Give this man a cookie, he's figured it out!

Restrictions on immigration are stupid.  Most people don't want to leave their families, their homes, their language, and their culture behind -- even people from poor countries.  The fear that opening our borders to people from the developing world will cause us to be overrun with poor and dirty brown people is both racist and unfounded.

""Give me your tired, your poor, your hungry"" used to actually mean something in this country, and not surprisingly, it is on the backs of the immigrants that came when an open-door policy was in effect that this country's prosperity was built.

Open the borders!

&gt; no limits, which nicely dovetails into their hatred for social programs, all of which would rapidly disappear were such a policy put in place due to oversubscription....

Right... when did socialists get to be so xenophobic?  What happened to workers of the world uniting?  When did ""let's help the poor"" turn into ""let's close our borders so they can't use our hospitals or schools, let's enact economic protectionism so they can't trade with us""?  Why are you afraid that some undereducated Mexican or West African is going to steal your job?  Are you a fruit-picker or something?  The ones you (presumably) need to worry about are the ones who are better educated and smarter than you, and here's a hint: those folks will probably get visas and steal your job *anyway*.

I'm a leftist, not a libertarian.  Closed borders are just like fences in a bourgeois neighborhood -- designed to keep the rabble out.  And unlike you apparently, I *do* hope that the workers of the world will someday unite.

Most poor people want nothing more than the opportunity to better their position, to work hard, to make it in life.  The ones that have the fortitude to come to a new country and work are the cream of the crop -- they aren't shiftless layabouts, as a rule, that are going to steal your welfare away from you.

In my experience, violent or unsociable behavior on the part of immigrant minority groups usually happens a generation or two in, after they become jaded about their prospects in their parent's adopted country -- because people like you won't open doors for them.  Algerian immigrants in France are a perfect example -- take our side in a colonial conflict, risk your life and limb in the service of la patrie, ensuring you can never live in your home country again, and we'll repay you by never offering you or your children any good jobs or opportunities.  Yay!

(Also, just for your edification, it's much, much easier to get an immigrant visa to Canada than to the US, and I personally knew many Chinese who went to school in the EU because they could get student visas to go to school there -- whereas the US refused them entry even with an acceptance letter to a top-twenty school.)",1234530673,4,4,t5_2fwo,808140

&gt;not letting workers go to where their skills are most productive harms everyone. If countries stopped being so retarded, racist and xenophobic everyone would have a much better life.

I agree whole heartedly with the idea that borders should be set up in such a way that productive people can go where ever they want, so that governments would be forced to compete with each other on taxes, services and so on.  This would definitely lead to a better life for everyone I think.

For some reason CVS needs a prescription for things that heal you and hold them locked in the back of the store, while cigarettes (which kill you) are advertised in the front ... definitely odd.

I believe that we are a global society of humans, nothing more. Now, Genocide has always been around. I'm not quite sure why the Jews, gypice, commies and other dissidents were in any particular way different from what Stalin or chairman Mao did, but why is it always a holocaust memorial as opposed to a Ukrainian holocaust memorial or Soviet Holocaust memorial 

Nearly 2 million died in Stalins initial purges, that included anyone different financially or artists or scientists. Anyone different from the status quo. The dark side of socialism I suppose. Stalin's purges in Mongolia were up to 7,000,000. The 10,000,000 that died to due to a failed soviet policy. Then there were the Ukrainians which death toll amounted somewhere between 6-8,000,000. Around 2 million died in the gulags and kulak forced resettlement. 

Hitler and Stalin were two sides of the same coin. One purged for racial purposes and the other for social. Other purges and genocides include the Rwandan which took 1,000,000 lives. The Bosnian genocides of the 1990's. It streches further back then that. The Assyrian Empire, The ancient jews were a hugely genocidal race. God told them to kill the Amalekites and Midianites. Others are lost to history. 

Then there are the American genocides, yes America. We were not yet America as we know it but our European ancestors killed from a low of 8 million to a high of 112,000,000. Its in debate because some were killed by guns and swords and other decease that was carried. Then there were the american genocides, between 1940-1890 nearly 22,000 were killed. Then there were the trail of tears that my ancestors had to endure. 17,000 cherokee, and their 5000 slaves were forced to relocate and an estimated 4,000 died along the way. 

Then there were the natives of Argentina. Then in France where an estimated 800,000 died during the the war of Vendée, then there were the genocides in the Philippines caused by the US were around 800,000 died. The English blockade on Irish ports lead to 4,000,000 during the Irish Potato famine. In China killed between 1750-1725 between 400,000 and 800,000 died of the Dzungars. 

Then the Ottomans and they killed ALOT of people due to ethnicity. The Armenians which 2,000,000 died. Then they killed nearly 300,000 in Greece. Which they deny to this day. 

It doesnt in there here are some figures from the past 59 years. 
Zanzibar - 5-12,000
Guatemala- 200,000
Bangladesh- 1,500,000
Burundi- 300,000, then 25,000 later in the 90s. Which had connection to the Rwandan
During the over through in Equatorial Guinea the president killed 1/3 of the population nearly 80,000
Pol-Pot in Cambodia killed 1,500,000 during slave laber and purges.
From 1975 to 1999 and estimated 60,000- 100,000 died in East Timur under the Indonesians.
Then the Soviet war in Afghanistan.
500,000 in Ethiopia under a dictators rule. Intellectuals mostly.
Saddam Husein killed nearly 150,000 during his Al-Anfal campaign where he gassed and killed the Kurds. 
In Brazil between 1970s-1990s.
In the congo where nearly 6,000,000 died due to ethnic cleansing and the general distrust of the dictator in charge. 

There there is whats going on today, the war in Israel right now, our wars with the Iraqis, ect. Many unknown and countless. 

We kill each other discriminatly, without cause or care sometimes. Its always happened and I hate to say it may always continue to happen. What happens when we find an lower technological alien race? Are we going to do what the Europeans and Americans did to the Native Americans? Who is next while we turn a blind eye to it? This stuff is NEVER taught in school, aside from higher college. We ignore it as though it'll just go away. We need to unite, the free and compassionate of this world to stop these things from happening. Its the only thing thats going to stop us from being animals.

I'm talking about the new breed of fascists in Europe, in suits and ties, who speak eloquently and have the political power to shape the future. And there's a new untermensch in town. The jews have left (or become nazis themselves, but I'm not gonna go into Israel here) and the new enemy to western monoculture is the muslim.

You seem to think nazism only centers around jews. It historically did, but not exclusively. Several types of untermensch were systematically eradicated under Hitler. His plan was much bigger than just offing jews. 

The authoritarian sentiment of the pre-WW2 fascists has been spreading in Europe since 9/11, and coupled with racial and cultural disdain it's treading waters dangerously close to full blown nazism. And I prefer to call a spade a spade.

You might not agree with my personal opinion about what Wilders is doing cause you think ""neo-nazi"" is nothing but a bunch of teenage skinheads jacking off to pictures of Hitler. But IMHO, it's something much more dangerous than that.

In my country, Norway, we have a saying: ""Norway for Norwegians"". This is a typical extremist-right neo-nazi type slogan.

They cite the area as being ""area larger than 100 football pitches"".

This also doesn't say how much larger than 100 football pitches it is. How does this compare to the space needed for a nuclear reactor and the storage space needed for it's waste?

This article says there will be 7 towers at the California site.  Each of which would need to produce 186MW to get to the 1300MW that they say will be produced.  It doesn't say whether collection surface area will be increased or whether technological advances have improved output.

The article I provided says that the site in Spain has a method of storing heat energy for use at night by heating salt.  This method could be used in California as well, or some other method.  It is possible that there could be further tech advances in this area too.

It would be interesting, thank you.  Please consider doing so.

In the case of Russia, as I understand it (I apologize for horrible drunken semi-remembering generalizations about Russian motivations as I neither (a) am Russian nor (b) speak the language) the idea of ""defenders of christendom"", as I put it, is inextricably intertwined with the concept of being a barrier against incursions by the barbarian hordes.

It's, as I understand, not so much a religious question as a sociocultural and political one; Russia has historical seen itself as a European country that's at the same time terrified of the Germans/Poles/Lithuanians/Swedes, puzzled as to why the West takes such an antagonistic stance towards it, and determined to act as a bastion against the Mongols, Tatars, Arabs, Turkmen and other assorted funny-looking people down South and South-East (something a lot of commentators conveniently disregarded during the Georgian crisis recently.)

The whole ""christian"" thing is very tied in with Russian thinking about its role in ""civilization"" -- in fact, I would say that the two are rather synonymous, and that ""christian"" in the historical Russian geopolitical view is far far far far far less of a religious concept than, say, with anything coming out of the 30 Years' War in central Europe.  

The best parallel I can come up with in a ""Western"" sense is the concept of ""judeo-christian values"", or Max Weber's ""Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism"" -- which aren't intrinsically religious, but rather associations with perceived values of a certain religious perception, coupled with a supposed overarching extraneous set of philosophies, values and cultural contexts.  I would even go so far as to equate certain aspects of islam and hinduism with national / cultural trends in, respectively, certain Arab countries and India, with this.

Of course I was aware of the context NSFW is usually used in, but it seems like it's really exclusively related to sexual content (apart from the occasional site playing music etc, although come to think of it, I've never actually seen it used like that).

I'm sorry, I just really took the phrase that literally because the idea is pretty bizarre to me that sexual content would be *synonymous* with ""not safe for work"" and not just an example of it, because I could think of so many things more offensive than sex. Maybe it's just a culture thing, with Europeans being curiously more liberal on sexual topics than Americans. It just blows my mind that - according to the Wikipedia article, at least - pictures of swimwear models will be much more likely to get a NSFW tag than a Holocaust comic.

By the way, I was never referring to the actual content of the comic but just to what you could infer from the title and subreddit (I didn't think of the thumbnails because I have them disabled). My argument was that there was a high *potential* for it to have offensive content, that should keep people worried about what other people might get a glimpse at from clicking that link.

Anyway, I rest my case, it seems like I was wrong and I am once again befuddled by the strangeness of the world. Explain to me one thing though: If some employers/coworkers (are we even talking about a work environment here, or is it all just about not having your husbands and wives see what filthy stuff you're looking at on the internet? ;)) are so sensitive about sexual content that they might get you in trouble for looking at models in swimsuits, and if at the same time NSFW means *nothing* but sexual content, couldn't looking at a website that features frequent NSFW tags on its submissions get you into just as much trouble? Becauseit's clear you're looking at websites that feature sexual content? I mean, sure, you are not looking *at* the sexual content, but neither are you in the case of the swimsuits. If some people are going to be that prude, wouldn't it at least be consequential for them to be prude about NSFW tags, too?",1234571234,3,3,t5_2qh0s,[deleted]

* HFCS is a tough cookie. There's a correlation between HFCS and insulin resistance, but there's a correlation between cane sugar intake and insulin resistance. HFCS is fructose and glucose, and cane sugar is sucrose, which breaks down into fructose and glucose during digestion. The main factor in claiming the correlation between HFCS intake and obesity is the fact that the body regulates the breakdown of sucrose, which is bypassed if the breakdown occurs prior to consumption. So harmful effects are evident only when overconsuming, which doesn't imply that HFCS itself is more or less harmful than cane sugar.

Interestingly. In some of his writing on Japan in the 90's. Krugman argues that running deficits (10%) was not enough for Japan, but that they should also persue unconventional monetary policies. (convince people that it is a bad idea to hoard Yen, so that the currency could drop)

Let me make some defence against your accusation that I'm as factually incorrect as it is possible to be.

1) Although there have been some countries formally signed onto copyright for a long time, the move into the fold of eastern europe and China significantly expands the percentage of the globe covered. Previously there was an alternative system, at the moment there is no significant population base challenging the orthodoxy.

2) The scope of these things has crept far further in in recent history than in the time before. The nature of things that can be patented has significantly expanded, IP durations have moved out, and it's now far harder to do commercial or non-commercial breaches than it was previously (there's a difference between laws that aren't enforced, and those that can hit you around the globe). Just in the last decade there have been extensions to scope and duration of ""IP"" pushed out by unilateral trade agreements between the US and other countries, usually under the guise of a ""free"" trade treaty.

3) Regardless of the nationality of the participants, the issue is the source of the momentum that causes countries to join them and then be serious in enforcing policy.

Copyright extensions in Singapore, China, South Korea and Australia are now significantly longer than they were ten years ago. Why? Due to evangelism from the US government.

However, perhaps I'll be content to learn that I've overstated it. What do you think has fuelled the world's move towards giving property rights to things that are not scarce?

&gt; The US wasn't even really part of that same
&gt; system until 1989

How did things fit together before then?

I agree unnecessary changes in charger standards just to increase sales is annoying. But the other problem is far more important and the Commission has looked into _that_ problem several times and every time has it left it alone.

As it stands now: mobile phones across European borders is not a viable option. As for the charger (adapter) issue very few European countries use the same kinds of electrical sockets anyway therefore it wouldn't make much different even if all manufacturers agreed on one standard.

Therefore I reckon the European Commission is rather lame when it moves it's fat ass into action over chargers but can't get moving (in spite of numerous half assed attempts) over charges.

I suggest this unwillingness to move against carriers is due to the fact that a substantial parts of carriers are closely affiliated with the states (until recently most were more or less state owned) and to generous 'funding' in important places.",1234640916,-1,-1,t5_2qh16,jerryF

The commissioner wants to end current practices, where mobile phone manufacturers such as Nokia and Sony continue to introduce new models of adapters to the marketplace. This means the consumer will have to replace their current chargers.

I think it's as simple as countries protecting their own interests. I know it's popular to bash the US, but we're hardly alone in pushing for greater protections on our major industries. The European Union has been pushing to extend [Protected Designations of Origin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_designation_of_origin), a concept which barely even *exists* outside the EU. Why? Because EU countries make a lot of money off of these things. Right now, I can go to the store and buy ""champagne"" from California. If the EU got its way, I wouldn't be able to do that. I'd only be able to buy ""sparkling wine"" from California--doesn't quite have the same ring to it. Sales of California wines would certainly suffer. Is that particular species of grape ""scarce""? Is there some secret voodoo incantation that makes French wine inherently better than Californian wine? No. Sounds an awful lot like a cross between a trademark and a patent to me.

What I get from clicking around in that Wikipedia article is that the US just opted out of the Berne Convention, the agreement rest of the world used. Matter of fact, it seems like the rest of the world had a more aggressive copyright policy, and that's why the US didn't want in.

Back in 1996, the UK had had the same political party in power for 17 years, the country was stagnating and political corruption becoming endemic. More importantly the UK was lacking self-esteem back, it was still considered the poor man of Europe.

A lot of that changed in the 1997 election when the Conservative government was thrown out and replaced by Labour. This was a breath of fresh air, Labour kept a lot of working economic policies intact while putting serious efforts into making the UK an ecomonically fairer place. British self-esteem and its economic prowess climbed over the next few years and Britain climbed the ranks of respected powers. British cultural output also increased in the following years. Despite protestations that British culture was becoming a monoculture, the UK produced some excellent TV programmes, films, and pop groups in the 2000s, especially when compared to early-mid 90's.

Also gone is the puritanical streak of the 1990s: Having a sports club/shops/anything open on a Sunday is no problem now. Even pubs may open past 11pm nowadays. Britain is much more gay-friendly than it was in 1996. British newspapers give their government a better run for their money than their US counterparts.

Other things have stayed the same: Brits are still just as self-critical as they always have been, they almost have in inverted sense of national  pride. They are also very much open to living somewhere else, but that's not due to outright rejection of British values, a lot of the time it has more to do with curiosity and the desire to try out a new place. And yes, the UK does have a particular sardonic spirit and a dark sense of humour, but that's the inevitable consequence of living on a small soggy, meteorologically bleak island.

In this instance, it merely refused a diplomat.  

The author of this article says it himself: ""a country where a view can be held and expressed, provided – and this has always been true – that it DOES NOT FOMENT VIOLENCE"".  And what, pray tell, does he expect the propagation of hate speech to otherwise accomplish than the straining of relations which inevitably leads to violence?

In refference to ""Had a foreign parliamentarian who disliked Christians and considered the Bible to be inflammatory planned a visit to Britain, does anyone imagine he would have been prevented from doing so? No, and neither should he have been. This must work for everyone.""

That statement is highly presumptuous, as it both insults the man for assuming all his decisions are based on religion, and forgets that Christians and Jews are held in high regard in Islam.  Look up ""Children of the Book"".

Hate speech should be defending under any free society, but that is no reason why it should be propagated- least of all to a governing body.  I ask you, what would be the reaction if he wanted to play ""Triumph of the Will""?  Very likely the same.  Neonazism is on the rise in Europe as it is.  Unless people want Europe to become reactionary and xenophobic (look at some of the recent developments in Italy), for Britain to fall to the white-only BNP, and for the UK in 2009 to look more like Germany 1939, they should walk carefully the line between free speech and promoting hate.

EDIT - It's telling that I get downmodded for that comment.  

There's a hardcore of know-nothings on the internet that appear desperate for the UK to fit their police state / Big Brother / 1984 fantasy - and it seems like most of them come from the US.  Just look at the comments in this thread!

These fantasies are fed by the Telegraph and the Daily Mail, who sell their papers on a campaign that appeals to people who want to blame 'the others' for their own problems and failures.  They want to blame the government or the EU or immigrants or teenagers for their disappointment with life.

Is Britain perfect? Big surprise: no.

Is it a police state with CCTV watching every person every minute of the day?  Not even close.

In short, jump aboard the clue train, bubba.  Or maybe a bit of scripture for readers from the United States of Jeebus:

Article 10 – Freedom of expression:

* Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.
* The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, **for the protection of health or morals**, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.

Or, in short, everybody's got the right to free speech without interference from the state, except when the state interferes (because protection of morals can mean just about anything).

Perhaps the Telegraph should have waken up ~60 years ago when the [European Convention on Human Rights](http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm)
was passed: the government gets to decide what's good for our morals and Wilders' movie is not it.

Edited to add: while I'm at it, there was quite a censorship campaign against [On the verge](http://www.schnews.org.uk/schmovies/index-on-the-verge.htm).   Basically the authorities did not grant a license for the movie and so any theatre that wanted to show it was threatened by the police.
The entire thing was very neat.",1234693429,4,4,t5_2qh13,[deleted]
