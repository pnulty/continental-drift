,"It's not a ""claim"". Almost every economist whose view I've read on this situation, be they rigid Austrians or Keynesians, has agreed that stimulus spending was needed. Low interest rates certainly did feed the bubble throughout the 2000's, but that was the fault of the Greenspan/Friedman acolytes who ignored all of the lessons that were learned during and after the Great Depression. 

There IS a clear and grave danger of long-term deflation. The situation we're in today is strikingly similar to what Japan went through. They have been caught in a cycle of deflation and low growth for the last 20+ years. Every time their economy perked up a bit, it was killed with premature spending cuts and tax increases. 

People go on about the ""war on the dollar"" and how the currency is going to be destroyed, but as I said before, T-bills are at their lowest yields in a very long time, and the dollar is stronger than it has been in years. Undoubtedly, in about 20 years if we're still pushing stimulus spending, then we'll be in a gigantic world of hurt, but for the next 5 years or so? We're absolutely fine, particularly as long as Europe and the EU remains in the funk. The only thing that could cause the deficit to do us big-time harm in the short and medium term is if another reserve currency magically appears. The Euro threatened to do that for awhile, but it's pretty obvious that won't be happening, and China shows no signs whatsoever of wanting the Yuan to become the world's de-facto reserve currency anytime soon. 

Honestly, the Social Security problem is pretty simple: the age at which people can qualify just has to be bumped up by 5 years or so. That won't fully fill the hole, but will go a very long way to doing so. No desperate austerity measures are needed.

I don't think you understand what an austerity program at this point will do to the economy. Or, if you do, you don't give a shit. Talk about the American economy ""surviving""? If massive spending cuts were enacted, what we would see would be beyond anything those advocating such measures possibly imagine. For an idea, look at the Baltic states, particularly Latvia. GDP dropped by almost 25% since initiation of an austerity program. *THAT* is economic destruction.

I don't think there's anyone who knows anything about economics who's saying ""deficits should continue to be built up forever!"" The budget deficit has to be cut. But the time to do so. Is. *not*. now. ",1277942435,c0t9cdb,False,,JaseFace,1426362510,0,t5_2qh13,0,True,0,0,t1_c0t9cdb,False,t1_c0t8yiv,0,t3_ckdpp,,worldnews
,"Check the FIFA wiki for international structure
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA#Structure


FIFA is made of CONCACAF (N.A, Carribean), UEFA (europe), CONMEBOL (S.A.),  CAF (africa), AFC (asia and Australia), OFC (new zealand and pacific islands)

FIFA - World Cup, Club World Cup, Confederations Cup (nations), and replicas of this stuff at youth and women's levels.


CONCACAF - Gold Cup (nations), Champions League (winning clubs), Superliga (lesser clubs)


UEFA - Euro Cup (nations), Champions League (winners), Europa Cup (lesser clubs)


CONMEBOL - Copa America (Nations), Copa Libertadores (clubs), Copa Sudamericana (lesser clubs..thats debatable)


CAF - African Cup of Nations (nations), African Champions League (clubs), some other shit


AFC - Asian Cup (nations), Asian Champions League (clubs), other shit. 


Oceania - Polynesia Cup (nations), Oceania Champions League (clubs)


Each nation has a league (and possibly lower level leagues), and a cup, and sometimes additional cups. The league is always regarded as the most important thing to win, and the Cup usually is lower on the priority list. 


The USA has MLS for its league, and the US Open Cup for it's cup. Winners of the league (MLS Cup) and the shield (best regular season record) get automatic qualification to the CONCACAF Champions League. MLS Cup runner up and the US Open Cup winner get to play into that tournament with a qualifier. The next 4 MLS teams get to play in the less glamorous SuperLiga. Winning CONCACAF Champions league gets you to the FIFA Club World Cup. Superliga just gets you money.


All in all, it's pretty awesome that any team from anywhere can end up world champions by proving it. Samoa FC could win the Oceania champions league, and then pull off miraculous upsets to beat major South American and European competition to win the Club World Cup. 

Theoretically, you could start a team in the USA with your friends, miraculously win the US Open Cup, play in the CONCACAF Champions League, win that, and play in the FIFA Club World Cup.

And yeah, get a travel towel before you go, a microfibre one so it dries quickly, you don't want to put it away wet because it will stink.

I was told not to chance money at airports or at train stations because they are super expensive. Bring some pounds and some euros, enough to cover your costs for a couple of days. Don't put all of it in your wallet, hide some away in your bag.  Get a money belt if you want, but don't use it as your main way of carrying money, just put enough for a days outing in your wallet in your front pocket and the rest in the belt, you don't want to be lifting up your shirt to pull your money out each time.

,"&gt; How exactly does the WHO represent the nuclear industry?

It doesn't, but the IAEA, which led the Chernobyl Forum, does.

&gt; The TORCH report, however, does seem to be politically motivated (""requested by the European Greens""). This report, which was written by only two scientists and commissioned by an anti-nuclear politician, does not trump the official UN report that is the result of hundreds of scientists.

If that's your measure of validity, then why refer to an anti-coal activist report when looking at the impacts of coal power?

&gt; 40 kBq is still not a very large amount.

A minimum of 40kBq was enough to cause 5000 premature deaths among a population of 6 million. When you consider that the area contaminated by between 40 and 4kBq was home to over 200 million people, you'd expect to see a few thousand more cases.

&gt; They report that 2 million people die each year from air pollution (the majority of which they say is caused by burning fossil fuels), which is much higher than my estimate above.

That's a global figure. It's in fact much *lower* than your estimate of 11.5 million, especially when you consider that the attribution to coal burning is only a fraction of the WHO's 2 million.

You still haven't addressed the issue of how to make a like for like comparison of the differences in harm from each industry to validate your claim that deaths from Chernobyl are 'statistical noise'. As the nuclear lobby pointed out, the best way to make the comparison is by premature deaths per MW of generation. One thing you haven't considered so far is the health impacts of mining the fuel and disposing of the waste. And yes, the possibility of future climate change should also be in the mix. It's a complicated issue, and I don't think it's as obviously one-sided as you're trying to make it out to be.

Note that I've not tried to argue that coal power is safe, or nuclear is dangerous. I'm just trying to get you to remove your blinkers and get some perspective. I agree with you that coal is generally more harmful than nuclear, at least in areas with competent safety regimes, but that only applies as long as things work as intended, and it's not to say that nuclear power is harm*less*.

,"He worked in Jerusalem as a peace envoy (read - promote Israeli interests).

http://www.haaretz.com/news/tony-blair-receives-israeli-prize-worth-1-million-1.270265

&gt;Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair will be one of the three laureates of the Dan David Prize for 2009, awarded annually by Tel Aviv University.

&gt;Each of the laureates will receive a $1 million prize, 10 percent of which is contributed to 20 doctoral and post-doctoral scholarships.

&gt;Blair was selected to receive the prize in leadership for what the judges described as ""his exceptional leadership and steadfast determination in helping to engineer agreements and forge lasting solutions to areas in conflict."" 

Here's my take on it:
http://americangoy.blogspot.com/2009/04/tony-blair-paid-zionist-and-sarkozy.html


    Protected by the fake sinecure of Middle East envoy for the Quartet (the US, EU, UN and Russia), Blair operates largely from a small fortress in the American Colony Hotel in Jerusalem, where he is an apologist for the US in the Middle East and Israel, a difficult task following the bloodbath in Gaza. To assist his mortgages, he recently received an Israeli “peace prize” worth $1m.



You see, Tony Blair, the neocon in the disguise of a Labour party apparatchik (""New Labour - it is not new, and it s not labour""), is doing what any good servant of the power that be does - he has a second career, a very, very well paid career, paid for by the people whose bidding he did while in office (for example, for bringing British soldiers' blood to further Israeli security goals).

He is a so called ""peace envoy"", supposedly trying to bring peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis.

He does most of his work from a luxury hotel - in fact, he never leaves the place (Why should he? It's not like he has a real job or anything).

And just to keep himself impartial, Tony Blair, has had no qualms accepting a 1 million dollar prize from Israel - while he tries to mediate between Israel and Palestine.

Robert Moses, a famous New York architect, had designed these bridges in the thirties and in doing so had made certain that the New Yorkers had no other possibilities of reaching the beaches but on just these highways. Winner noticed that these bridges are built very low, and that only automobiles could pass under them. Public buses, on the other hand, cannot pass. Having grown suspicious, Winner took a closer interest in Moses and his bridges. The situation was soon cleared up: Moses had intentionally had his bridges built so low to keep typical users of public transport, at that time the poorer strata of the population and especially blacks, away from the beaches and to reserve these for the white middle classes. Decades after Moses’ death, the resentments of a singular person are  then incorporated in his bridges as an ongoing social injustice ...

,"&gt; IQ tests are good for testing groups of people from similar cultural and genetic backgrounds. 

Culture (for all participants) should be more or less ""developed"", yes. But I disagree about the genetic background. There's no reason not to expect accurate results for e.g. a Japanese person (or a group of people) on an IQ test designed for Europeans. If they place at 115, that would mean they did a whole standard deviation better, with all implications and consequences (for performance, educational attainment, and so on). So should such a person move to Europe for example, they would most likely assume their IQ-appropriate social/economic niche. 

That's the whole point of controversy, isn't it - trying to find out exactly why different (immigrant or not) ethnic groups perform so differently in the ""modern"" developed societies?  

&gt; There are any number of reasons why an adopted child may perform unlike his or her peer group in his or her new home.

There's been a number of studies that demonstrated that, for example, asian adopted kids perform better than european adopted or natural children. Yes, and their parents' socio-economic status and age was controlled for. Moreover, asian immigrants perform better on IQ tests too (by about the same amount). You can't explain that away with biological mothers' drug addiction and poor nutrition and whatnot. 

&gt; As far as that goes, it has nothing to do with the evolution of human IQ. 

I disagree. IQ is a ""western"" test that measures the potential to perform in the modern/western/developed society. Nothing more, nothing less.  

IQ is highly hereditary. Some groups selected for high IQ, some didn't. The rest is pretty self-explanatory. 
 
&gt;It has everything to do with how the tests are written and how they are administered.

It most certainly doesn't matter how the test is administered.

In the United States, we have God-given rights. These restrictions on government and society for the benefit of individuals. If the law tries to deny your right to freedom of speech, you fight whoever shows up to enforce that decision.

Elsewhere, largely in Europe, you have society-granted rights. These are things that you are guaranteed by law, and that can be changed by law. They are much weaker than God-given rights, but it also makes rational sense for them to be more expansive and include things like healthcare and internet access.

The concept of God-given rights is important (even if, like me, you don't believe in any God). Society *must* be constrained from trampling on the core human rights of the individual.

,"&gt;I don't understand your point. America has it's own currency true. 

What I mean is that the American government (central bank + treasury) is the issuer of its own currency. This is meant as something distinct from a user of currency. So for instance households, countries, banking sector, etc. are all users of American dollars, they can only obtain American dollars when the American government spends (either through central bank operations or treasury spending). 

&gt;But as long as it REQUIRES foreign bond purchases in order to sustain it's public spending (which it does) then it is vulnerable both to the willingness of foreigners to lend it money AND the willingness for foreigners to hold it's currency. 

There are a few points here:

Firstly, you’re assuming again that the American government is a user of American dollars. 

Secondly, the money you are referring to is American dollars which is a liability on the consolidated government’s balance sheet (central bank + treasury). As it is a liability on the balance sheet (specifically the central banks) this means that the government is the issuer, as liabilities imply a source. 

In a monetary system characterised by floating exchange rates and fiat currency it makes no sense to state: ‘the government issues bonds to collect its own liabilities in order to finance its spending’. You are essentially saying that the government needs to ‘save’ its own liabilities in order to spend, which is nonsensical. 

If this is the case then what role do bonds perform in our monetary system and why does the government issue them at all?

To answer this question, it’s important to understand that transactions to and from the government have upon the private sectors balance sheet:

Governments spend by either crediting private sector bank accounts or be issuing cheques. In either case, net financial assets are created for the private sector. This asset takes the form of either currency or reserves.

Government taxation occurs by the government debiting private sector bank accounts. This destroys reserves and currency (net financial assets). 

The implication from this should be clear: government spending and taxation without any other operations affects the reserve position of the private sector. If government spending leads to an excess reserve position then the overnight interest rate will fall below the central bank’s target rate and to zero, as banks who try to sell their excess reserves only have other banks with excess reserves to sell to. As banks will always try to minimise their holdings of reserves (above any minimum legal requirements and any liquidity preferences) the overnight rate will therefore drop. The opposite of this will occur when the government taxes, the reserve position may be  deficient and banks who are deficient in reserves will continually bid up the price as they can find no sellers. The overnight rate will increase. In either case, the overnight rate remains volatile and depends completely on the transactions to and from the government, this is known as the ‘reserve effect’. As the central bank loses control over its target rate it needs to implement operations which will reduce this.

Minimising the ‘reserve effect’ of government spending requires constant coordination between the treasury and the central bank, as the treasury informs the central bank of expected outflows and inflows. In instances where the flows will lead to the private sector having an excess reserve position a number of operations may be taken: debiting of tax and loan accounts and/or issuing of bonds. If you want me to discuss the former I can but to save time I will just discuss the latter.
The issuing of bonds by the government is a interest rate maintenance operation not a financing operation. When the government (central bank + treasury) issues a bond or any form of security the result is that the composition of financial assets within the private sector are changed. In other words, bond sales will lead to the private sector being debited an amount of reserves equal to the amount of the bond sale. The net result is that a financial asset will change from currency/reserves to a government bond and the reserve position of the private sector will be less the amount of the bond. This reduces the reserve effect and allows the central bank to maintain its target.

This is the case of all bond sales (by a government who specifies purchase of the bond with its own liabilities) regardless of who they are to. 

TL;DR: government spending can lead to excess reserves within the private sector. This can lead to the overnight rate falling to zero. Bond sales drain reserves allow the overnight rate to stay at the central banks target.

&gt;America has the worlds reserve currency but this makes it less vulnerable not invulnerable, countries go bankrupt when their currency is no longer trusted and there is a ""run on"" said currency which spikes interest rates and forces them to default (declare bankruptcy). 

Any country which issues its own currency and operates within a system of floating exchange rates and non-convertible currency can never default for operational reasons – it may default for political reasons but this is completely different.

&gt;If countries couldn't go bankrupt the IMF wouldn't have had to lend money too and get the economies on track of half a dozen different countries over the past 20 years.

The use of the word ‘money’ is ambiguous in our current monetary system money is always someone’s liability. The IMF cannot provide the American government with American dollars unless the American government spends first and therefore provides the asset for the private sector (as something distinct from the American government).

&gt;Explain to me why a country defaulting on it's debt (a country with it's own currency) is any different to an individual restructuring or entirely defaulting on a loan they've taken?

A country who doesn’t issuer their own currency or operates with fixed exchange rates or on a gold standard CAN default on their debt. In this instance the country is the user of the currency as it has to maintain a specific convertibility of its liabilities to another asset (gold, another currency, etc.) and is therefore comparable to an individual or firm, who are also users of currency. An example of such a country would be any country within the European Union (pending whatever institutional arrangements occur in regards to the current situation) and any state of any country (e.g. California). In this instance there is no difference between a country or an individual defaulting.

In the example you specified – a country with its own currency – the default would arise due to political reasons not due to operational reasons. An individual who is a user of currency would default due to operational reasons (e.g. insufficient cash flow). In other words a government which issues its own currency is never insolvent and cna never default due to insolvency, whilst an individual is a user and may default due to insolvency. 

I'd like to add that countries may be vulnerable to expectations. So if the market expected a particular country to default on its debt (despite being an issuer) there may possibly be volatility in long term bond rates. The next move would depend upon the government’s economic advisers and whether they understand the distinction between a user of currency and an issuer. If they did, the government would simply not issue the bonds and use another operation to drain reserves (as after all bonds are simply interest rate maintenance operations). So they could (in America) draw down tax and loan accounts or they could minimise the spread between the support rate and target rate – in fact they could make the rates the same, which would eliminate all excess reserves within the monetary system.

I hope this is clear. ",1277965438,c0ta4xs,False,,height,1426362880,0,t5_2qh1s,0,True,1,0,t1_c0ta4xs,False,t1_c0t7egg,1,t3_ck5uv,,Economics

,"There were certainly other novels written *in* America that came before (Nathaniel Hawthorne also had a successful novel prior, and I'm sure there were others), but I think it'd be very easy to mistake any of them for English literature, rather than American. My point is more that *Huckleberry Finn* began defining a new, distinctive, American literature. The kind that owes no fealty to English and European literature.

The real point is that *Huck Finn* is an important work, perhaps the most important work, in American literature (even if we quibble over the definition of the ""first Great American novel""), and people who pan it are people whose taste is...questionable. I've nowhere suggested games can't be art, which seems to be the assumption some folks are taking here...that if you love *Huckleberry Finn* you must agree with all of Ebert's opinions on everything.

,"
While religion was once useful to early mankind as a source of kinship and explanation for natural phenomena, it now serves as a thorn in the side of rational society. Religion is a relic of our evolutionary past, as unnecessary for survival as the appendix or wisdom teeth. As Richard Dawkins pointed out in The God Delusion, our anachronistic propensity for the mystical is double-edge of our natural instinct to form groups. Much like how a moth’s ability to guide by starlight can lead it straight into a flame or bouncing off a bulb, our aptitude for organization can cause us to falsely create excessive artificial differences between one another out of our fear of the unknown. Thus, we find socially-constructed theological barriers that serve no purpose other than to reinforce the engrained us/them dichotomy. The conflict between Hinduism and Islam, Protestantism and Catholicism, are the products of this overactive human imagination. Only by recognizing religion as the destructive tribalism can we work against these injustices. Reason stands to enlighten us from these pointless hostilities; separations as valid as race or ethnicity. 
Every form of primitive society has some way of mythologizing the terrible uncertainty of nature with religion. While we could transverse human history for countless instances of unreasonable, dispelled mythologies, the best examples come recently. During WW2, in the Pacific theater, previously undisturbed tribes were divinely inspired by the fantastical innovations of the visiting modern man into forming “cago cults.” Upon witnessing such bizarre inventions as the radio and airplane, the natives created religions that cast the foreigners as gods, or at least instruments of gods. Like any religion, these cults had metaphysical explanations for how phenomena as transportation and electricity worked. Our innate predisposition to unsound, yet convenient interpretations of explainable phenomena incarnated itself in these “cargo cults,” providing insight on the process that drives the creation of all mysticism. By recognizing our biological tendency towards religion, we can combat its irrationality with thought and discourse.

The ethics expounded by religion preaches the empowerment of humanity, but only leads to the individual’s enslavement. Thinkers like Rousseau equated the status of the church to that of tyrants, and along with Nietzsche and Stirner denounced organized religion for suppressing ambition and passion natural in people. Pascal, for instance, abandoned his study of mathematics when he feared they conflicted with his Catholic faith. Doctor of the Church, St. Augustine was a pioneer of such in philosophy whose views on time paralleled Spinoza and deduced a theorem of cogito ergo sum that far predates Descartes. But because of the oppressive religious sentiment that dominated the 4th and 5th centuries, his attention was deviated from such intellectual matters to justifying Christian warfare and establishing the duality of God and Jesus. This ensuing stagnation of intelligence launched the dark ages in Europe. Religions such as Christianity that instill guilt in the believer for the unchangeable, yet force them to resign to a fate of meekness. 
Most religions derive their conceptions of virtue based on the absence of vice, inherently feeding off their hatred of sin and evil. Nietzsche lauded this sentiment as self-defeating in his parable On Passing By¸ in which Zarathustra encounters his ape parody who exhausts his breath counseling him against entering a great city. Zarathustra assess his diatribe at pointless and reasons that the ape’s insecurities have demanded it seek eternal vengeance against the city, an entirely vain pursuit. If the ape had no love left for his city, he would pass by. But like religion’s obsession with retribution, he remains bound to that which he claims to despise most. Nietzsche captures this ineffectual conception of good and evil with, “there are [those] who call it virtue when their vices grow lazy,” meaning religions that define their virtues on the purging of vices inevitably create their vain paradises only as far their vengeance will stretch.

&gt;
&gt;( 1 ) The dignity of man is inviolable. To respect and protect it is the duty of all state authority.  
&gt;( 2 ) The German people therefore acknowledge inviolable and inalienable human rights as the basis of every community, of peace and of justice in the world. [...]

You are confusing human rights with social rights (both are not entirely destinct and the same right can often be interpreted in both ways).

Human rights are ""defensive rights"" to protect the individual from the state, while social rights create claims by individuals against it (like the right to education).

European countries are social democracies (or ""third way"" countries) which combine free markets with elements of socialism to combat the negative effects of capitalism (unemployment, market failiures, exploitation...).

Regardless of what IQ scores actually represent, the between-race IQ gaps are known and reproducible. _The controversy in the field is not over whether the gap exists but what the gap actually means and where it comes from._

Second point, lets try a syllogism-  
Major Premise: People within a nation breed with one another more frequently than than they do with those outside their nation (on average), and have done so historically.
Minor Premise: Breeding is a biological activity, and heredity is a concept with a concrete, biological basis (i.e. DNA exists, sperm + egg and all that).
Conclusion: People within a national boundary are, on average, more biologically related to one another (have more recent common ancestors) than they are to people in another national boundary. 

Even given the fact of migration and its acceleration in recent history this is true (what fraction of a population is actually emigrating/immigrating at any time?).

,"I don't know if I can agree with them as lessons as they're observations that may generally be true.

For example number 10 I can't agree with.  Jen had much potential for being a winner and she did win many of the challenges.  It's not as if a hot girl can lack talent it's just that there's only been 6 seasons and it has been a toss up.

As for Lesson 1 I guess it's important but IIRC amuse-bouche has been quickfire and never elimination so it's not that important.  Plus and just because it's a bit large doesn't hurt it as much as if it tastes bad.

I guess Lesson 2 is true, but you have no clue if that really effects the judging.

Lesson 3 is just...dumb.  If you're good at something and it comes out good then you're fine.  If all you did was cook scallops but fit it to the challenge and made it taste good then they've said that you won't be penalized.  They only judge from that single elimination challenge they can't be influenced by the fact that you cooked the same thing last time.  They may say it, but if you read the blogs and whatnot you'll know that it never factors in to their actual judging.

Lesson 4...if it makes sense.  Well yeah if it makes sense, but you could apply that to anything.  Though I guess it's pretty cool to just try to put bacon into everything.  Wouldn't hurt too much, but then again if you look at tonight's episode.  Bacon wrapped is generally a good idea, but he didn't cook it long enough and it was a complete failure.

Lesson 5 I will agree that doing dessert is just death.

Lesson 6 I'm not sure if it's completely true.  Most of the people in the past have been able to do well in front of the house because they're the right personality.  I wouldn't exactly consider a safe be I would think it's about the same difficulty

Lesson 7 As long as you deconstruct it and it tastes well then great.  There have been however deconstructed dishes that tasted horrible and people have been at the bottom because of it.  So I can't agree with this lesson at all

Lesson 8 I'll agree with this lesson and it's been reiterated by the judges that simple good food is a winner.  Keeping things simple has been a tried and true result.  Having many things going on at once can easily cause for things to go out of control, but it's a risk you take because if you pull it off it will generally be better than the simply way which has also been chided for being not professional enough.

Lesson 9 I guess it's true.  He's pretty tough, but I think it's mainly because he's from Europe and has a different palette.  Depending on the environment you're in and where you grow up a person's tastes are different.  For example depending on the moisture content in the air you may have to adjust a recipe you have bread because of how it will bake and how it will sit.  If you grow up in a place with a lot of moisture and then go somewhere else with a lot less tastes will be different.  What I mean to say that in Europe the tastes can be different so you learn a different palette from what people are served in America which can effect your judging.  I'm not faulting Toby Young, but just explaining that even though he's mean he's being the same mean to each contestant and in that regard is fair.

,"Yes. I have a very clear and concise idea about what is going on at the club. 

A board who decided to let the manager go, while having nothing to offer for a new manager except blood, sweat and tears. A squad with a fair starting XI but absolutely no depth to add with regards to the bench, who has to find a manager who is willing to work at a club where you can't necessarily expect to keep your job if the sale of the club goes through, if someone eventually meets the ridiculous valuation Tweedledim and Tweedledumb has set. 

Until new owners arrive, you can expect a net transfer budget of nil per season, except for what you can demand prior to being hired. You have a squad where several players are expressing a cautious desire to leave, while other European clubs are circling in the water like sharks drawn to the smell of blood, hoping to pick up players for a price that at average lies £5-10M lower than a realistic valuation, hoping that more players will want to go the Alonso route, handing in a transfer request, forcing the hand of the club while devaluating themselves.

Oh yeah, a debt that has trippled under the new owners, while they have been busy getting owners dividends of any profits the club has managed to get per season, up to a point where they have effectively made back every single cent they paid for the club when they purchased it. 

Now you have a new manager, who has one single summer to build a squad that can get back to the accustomed place in the top four.

,"I was visiting Switzerland with some fellow countrymen and our host decided to take us to a club. He proceeded to order the drink bottles and arrange for 7 girls to come to our table, one for every guy. I got the youngest one who was from an eastern European country, she had only arrived for a week or so and spoke hardly any English. All the guys are having some fun with their girls, grabbing them and kissing them and whatnot. I had a GF back home, and I really didn't feel much need for any of that. So, while all the guys are entangled with their girls, I'm desperately trying to be nice to mine and keep a conversation, but it's impossible. I can see she's starting to wonder why I don't try to make out with her (everyone else is) or grope her or something. She starts scratching my back (damn that felt good) and I arch with pleasure, but still try to not get too physical.

Well the music was playing and there was no other guys at the club so I decided to leap from my seat and head for the strip pole. I wrap my hands around it and try to mimic the stuff you see in the movies, but Christ that stuff is hard. Seriously. Still, I'm having fun and the girls who were just sitting around with no one rush to me and start to dance with me. One or two get a little frisky and start to strip me. While I'm trying to keep my clothes on (but I really didn't care, I was having lots of fun) even most of the girls from our table flock to me. At this point dancing was pretty much over. I had way too many hands stripping me and I felt like a football player swarmed in by fans in the last match of a division-climbing season. When I got down to my briefs, I figured the other guys didn't really want to see the full monty so I clung on to them (the briefs) and ended the show. Everyone loved it, specially the girls.

Give it 35-55 years. China has reached level 9 of its monopoly on natural resources, heavy industry and manufacturing. The Arab nations have bought in, agreeing to let their fanatics continue to kick NATO's shins in exchange for an elevated status in the Chinaconomy. China, realizing the only real threat to its dominance is a Russia that is finally getting off the bottle, institutes plans to destabilize outer regions of the Russian interior, places vastly different from high flying Moscow. Russian forces engage on its own soil and China capitalizes on bad press and real violations to support UN intervention. Russia does not like this and withdraws from the UN. In short order, proxy wars spread through central Asia. Wargasming, North Korea blows a gasket, invades Siberia and simultaneously invades South Korea. Japanese and American Forces engage. China pumps up the volume and arms and aid pour into Anti-American states worldwide. South America becomes a bristling communist fortress, Central Africa follows suit. Western Europe is yoked with trade demands, America is nearly broke. Canada is only slightly worried at this point. 

China uses Russia's behavior to force a UN ban on nuclear weapons. They have no intent on following their own ban, nor does anyone else. But now Chinese spying technology is unmatched and the spawn of Ghostnet reveals overt evidence of US/Russian/NATO violations of ban. Developing world sees its opportunity to shirk the old order of things and turns on NATO. UN is effectively defunct. Chinese take their war with Russia HOT. Mid range nukes used on military targets. Russia and Central Asia become target of conventional invasion after Russian nuke stockpile is destroyed. US and NATO engages to contain war to eastern russia. Japan is losing ground in Korea.

,"Unfortunately the Finnish Supreme Court doesn't translate it's decisions, but here's a short summary from [their website](http://www.kko.fi/51265.htm). I'm not a lawyer and there are some opinions in between, so..

One important thing to note is that the admins were found guilty, because the courts (all the way to supreme court) saw that the admins were a crucial part of this private tracker as the access to files depended on one's ratio and for some other factors. Interestingly, on these grounds the alleged admins of The Pirate Bay wouldn't be responsible for piracy.

Also, originally Electronic Arts wanted a cool 251 200 euros, Teosto (the composers' copyright society) 1 827 704 euros, and Adobe/Macromedia 1 584 868,58 euros. The courts did however think that it was outright stupid to try to collect retail price * downloads from the admins. The supreme court went even further and said that it wasn't ok to use boxed retail prices including VAT to assess the damage as the distribution was digital and the price should be comparable to legal digital distribution. Also, because the admins didn't do this stuff for profit, the price * downloads approach was wrong too. The Supreme Court also saw that not all downloads would have resulted in a sale otherwise and, because downloading was so easy, many downloads were probably not even used or were just used for a trial period. The lower courts would have put the damages at 10% of asked, but the supreme court increased it to 15%, except for music files, were it increased to 25% of asked. Also, because this is what the courts saw as a reasonable compensation for copyright infringement and weren't damages, they can't be negotiated under the copyright law (which kinda sucks).

So, in the end, the guys need to pay

* Teosto (aka Finnish RIAA): 74 034 euros
* ÄKT (aka Finnish MPAA): 145 423 euros
* other movie companies not in ÄKT: ~140k euros
* Yleisradio (aka Finnish BBC): 246 euros
* Activision: 7 689 euros (or, 550 COD:MW2 map packs)
* Atari: 5 467 euros
* Nokia: 576 euros
* Sony Computer Entertainment Europe: 277 euros
* Vivendi: 5 535 euros
* Electronic Arts: 37 680 euros
* Adobe: was ok with what court of appeals ordered, which was probably 10% of asked excluding VAT, so around 130k.

[Read up on how the pill works](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill) if you're not familiar with it -- she's basically giving herself a bunch of hormones that engage in various gymcrackery relating to ovulation and its various mechanisms.

Because of this, things like menstruation and sex drive can change from before she started taking it.  Is it via prescription where you live?  If so, she should check with the prescribing doctor - if you are worried, this is worthwhile anyway, because you should both have a reasonable understanding of what any medications you or she take work, and how the whole mechanism functions.

I can't comment on the ""pregnant or not"" thing -- there's a better post in this thread that should help you clear it up -- but you can get home pregnancy tests in almost any drugstore if you are worried.  They are generally reasonably reliable _if you follow the instructions_; get two different ones and try them a week apart if you're really concerned.

,"&gt; What's interesting to me is that after all that, I believe Iceland is still intent on joining the Euro, which would be the very thing that would prevent them from having a similar recovery in the future.

Yes. And it makes sense. Because devaluation is just pushing (part of) your loss of GDP to your trade partners. You offer more of your own currency to them for the same goods, and you offer more of your goods for the same amount of their currency. For the same number of goods traded, more of your currency will be in play and less of their currency.

Hence, if your devaluation would have no impact on the amount of consumed/produced and traded goods then devaluing increases your GDP and decreases the GDP of your trade partners (now you see why GDP is not the end-all in deciding how good an economy is doing but merely one of a number of possible indicators)

In practice a devaluation will end up lowering trade across currency borders and hence the net end-result on Iceland's GDP is 'slightly' negative.

Iceland is a very small economy, so any devaluation it does is more or less irrelevant for it's trade partners. When the two entities are large economies (China and the USA for example) then the impact is noticeable. It explains why the USA is raising such a stink with China over its refusal to re-value the Yuan. Which has the reverse net-effect : it props op Chinese GDP in Yuan and depresses American GPD in dollar.

So : Iceland is staving off a fall in GDP by pushing that fall partly on its trade partners. Logically you can't do that anymore if you and your prtners are not longer different entities but are actually a monetary and financial unity.

Is Iceland therefore better off keeping it's own currency? To answer that you need to look at what advantages a currency union brings as well. The most obvious being that the Euro would have had them enjoy lower interest rates. Remember not so long ago it was very common for Icelandic people to have (part of) their car loan/home mortgage in a foreign currency just because the interest on loans in their own currency was so insanely high. It is my belief that that advantage is much larger than the loss of the ability to devalue. Especially because there is every reason to assume that Iceland would not have used the lower interest to masquerade reduced productivity like southern-European countries have done. It is likely that it would have used the lower interest rate much more as their northern-European neighbours have done and used it to invest more heavily in their own economy.",1277984976,c0tagqs,False,,bbibber,1426363033,0,t5_2qh1s,0,True,11,0,t1_c0tagqs,False,t1_c0t9zfs,11,t3_ckr1q,,Economics

Third, if you keep showing her how needy, clingy, desperate you are, (as a general rule) she will most likely never come back. You have to make her want to be with you. 

Avoid her. Show disinterest. Be aloof, daring, casual, laissez-faire. Show her that you can live just fine without her, but she can not live without you. 

Relax. It is not the end of the world. If you are supposed to be with her, you will be. It will happen. Understand this, it is very important.

,"Don't.

If you really insist, don't rush into things, plan carefully.

First of all, since you say you'd have $35k, it sounds like neither your house nor your 401k is particularly valuable. I don't know where you live but in this market it will be hard to cash out the full equity of the house if you can't afford to negotiate down a bit. 

If you do, use a tax adviser to help you settle your bill before you leave. You may stay gone a good long time but in old age you will need to come back to the good ol' US eventually.

Consider an alternative: keep the retirement in the bank and rent out the house with the help of a management company. Work for one more year, living in the cheapest apartment or room you can find - which should still be more comfortable, if less poetic, than European hostels and couch-surfing. Save up every dime you can, living the kind of life you would be living. If you're making $40k/year now you should be able to come out with $30k in the bank if you really push it.

Several studies have found that Oriental populations tend to have high mean IQs, strong visuo-spatial abilities but relatively weaker verbal abilities, as compared with Caucasian populations in the United States and Europe. The present paper reports data on these claims for 19 Korean infants adopted by families in Belgium. The children were tested with the WISC at a mean age of 10 yr. Their mean IQ was 118.7, the verbal IQ was 110.6 and the performance IQ 123.5. The results are interpreted as confirming those obtained from other Oriental populations.

-A cheap and really good lunch/dinner can be had at Vapiano on Sturegatan (look it up). I think it's a chain of restaurants, but whatever the case, this one rocks. I recommend the Linguini Bolognese for just under 100 SEK.
-Get a boat ride to the archipelago. You can go for a few hours, or even rent a cabin on one of the islands for a night or two (bring food/drink). Check with the tourist center.
-Avoid Sergels Torg and anything within a 1 km radius. It's not horrible, just full of mediocre food, shopping and very crowded. Any of the other parts of town has nice bars and restaurants.
-Partying: around Stureplan you will find the posh spots and perhaps the most silicone implants per capita in Northern Europe. My favorite spot (with more ""normal"" people) is called Fredsgatan 12, named after its street address. Södermalm has a lot of nice bars and pubs. And yes, alcohol is expensive. I believe the average beer costs around 40 SEK, and drinks around 100 SEK.
-Parks: Bring some food or a coffee to Humlegården and just hang out in and watch the beautiful people.
-Outskirts: Hagaparken is really beautiful and quiet, and not very far away. Drottningholm is also really nice, but further away. Take a boat ride from City Hall to go to Drottningholm, not the bus.

,"English is a fairly analytic language. Proto-Indo-European (PIE) and its less-than-recent descendants weren't: they had quite strongly synthetic morphosyntaces.

You just don't think of the complexity in English because it's been internalised.

With that said, another question arises: All the IE languages have tended towards becoming analytic. Is this a broad trend? That is, did every language begin agglutinatively, and will every language become isolating? The answer is probably 'no': there are modern languages that are far, far more synthetic than IE possibly could have been (the Aleutian languages immediately come to mind). It's also very plausible for languages to become synthetic, even when the parent language is strongly analytic.

The people pushing political correctness seem to me to almost always be liberal and frankly I find it childish the way so many people try to control the way I speak. I'm a caretaker for the mentally retarded and since I was a kid people have tried to change the way they refer them.

First it was mentally retarded. Descriptive, concise, understandable. Then you had kids calling each other 'retards' and the word got a negative connotation.

Then it was ""special"" - unfortunately, it was later deemed that the word was condescending and carried a negative connotation, most likely because us schoolkids began calling each other ""special.""

Then it was mentally disabled. But no - that was too mean too, because it carried a connotation that someone with a mental problem can't think. Then we changed it to ""developmentally challenged."" As far as I know, that's the accepted term. 

Seriously. This is fucking ridiculous. Everyone knows what the word ""retarded"" means and it's how people talk when among close friends anyway. Frankly, I find it offensive in the first place that they tried to change the word - people with mental retardation live incredibly challenging lives and don't get to experience the world the way the rest of us do. Most people can't imagine the lives that these people have had to lead. To take a word that denotes the challenges, the frustration, the disability of the people afflicted with it and try to flower it up by calling it ""developmentally disabled"" seems in a way disrespectful. 

""Retarded"" carries a negative connotation because being retarded is a horrible thing to live with. You can't change the reality by changing the language - if anything you separate society from itself.

Same with ""black"". ""Black"" is barely considered politically correct anymore - you're supposed to say ""African American"". When you or I see a black person we don't think ""there's an african american guy"", we think ""there's a black guy"", or even better ""there's a guy"". By pressuring people into using tongue twisters to refer to each other we've become afraid to talk to each other in a way that makes us feel comfortable. Just think about how the words make you feel - would you rather be in a room full of ""African Americans"" or ""black people"", or a room full of ""Caucausion/European Americans"" or ""white people""?

,"*Edit: Holy shit, wall of text incoming. I should train myself to write less in the future.*

About your first two paragraphs:

As I wrote, your incentive to ""run"" the factory should be fulfillment (and survival) - making a profit to acquire exchange goods and to secure/enhance your standard of living are, looked down apon from the apogees, a mere mean to comply with this incentive, which boils down to reasoning and/of satisfying urges.

That said, productivity is not labor and vice-versa. Of course you can have an urge to clutter someone with resources to waste them however he/she/it wanted, but not doing so is not what the exclusion from the means of production means. If you write about ""wasting good factory space and raw materials producting a good that society did not proportionally value"", this for me implies one of two things.

First, it might mean that there are people who are excluded from means of production and cannot substitute these (making wasing factory space an issue to begin with), what subjugates them to the people who run the factory. Not anarchism.

Second, it might mean that there should be some institution to tell what to produce. Of course, to overcome problems of scarcity and waste, production has to be planned better, but command economy usually favors the opposite. Neither anarchism nor ancap.

It seems to me that you're writing about scenarios rampant in command economies like in former Eastern Europe (if state-run) or the fascist economies (if privately-run). That's not what anarchism is about.

&gt; Is this exclusion?

Depends, but (when not counting ""wasting good factory space and raw materials"") it's not exclusion from the means of production. Nobody is forcing you *not* to spend your time and resources on pretty dances, and there's no real mean of production other than yourself, which is unmerchantable to begin with.

In the perfect world, if you have a reason to produce something, you should not be forced to rely on others except if it does affect them - of course nobody should be forced to not help you either, we're a social species and favors tend to get returned. If it affects them (even by being a big enough project, inspiring them, feeling embarrassed for you, or affecting them in a not so benign way) you should have to convince them. Just like now, except without coercion. Or like ancap.

&gt; Knowledge is decentralized.

It is. But it tends to spread. I guess you're not one of the wannabe-geniuses who want to be technological/intellectual gatekeepers, because this essentially is creating monopolies and thus incompatible with the free market and thus ancap. Market players have to be at eye level, otherwise they're not free. Products don't. And if items of knowledge happen to be means of production, we're back at the topic of exclusion.

If we're talking about an economy of mutual benefit and symbiosis, the creators of knowledge should focus on creating knowledge as far as they tend to strive. Sharing this knowledge provides incentive for those who benefit from it to give something back to its creators. This again is incompatible with an economy that forces its participants to focus on short-term profits through market dynamics-induced coercion.

Given the foreseeable ubiquity of knowledge distributing technology and automation of physical production, the decentralization of knowledge becomes decentralization of knowledge in its egalitarian sense, leading to an individual's knowledge only being limited by time and motivation. Of course not everyone should be a factory manager: people are different. But that doesn't mean there should be a hierarchy or property (of productive means).

&gt; Some people shouldn't be overseeing supply shipments and some people shouldn't be down on the floor interacting with customers. I don't think that valuing individuals on an individual basis is unethical nor undesirable.

It's not unethical or undesirable to value individuals on an individual basis *for individual purposes*. But rating them on a universal one-dimensional scale is at least intellectually dishonest.

&gt; We're all only mortals.

Why ""only""?

&gt; I'm not even sure that those pesky diminishing returns would allow us to ever exceed resource availabilities, scarce as they are, anyways.

That's because you're holding on to archaic definitions of being human. But even if we should never allow ourselves out of the wasteful mammalian form we naturally occupy: given the necessary knowledge and will, [there's plenty to escape that vicious cycle](http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/resource.html) even for much more individuals than those that make up mankind today.",1278017751,c0tbqk4,True,,[deleted],1426363643,0,t5_2qh5j,0,True,7,0,t1_c0tbqk4,False,t1_c0tbji7,7,t3_ckzk1,,Anarchism

,"There is actually very little evidence that traditional Native American warfare (specifically, speaking of the East Coast of North America, since we're discussing the advent of Europeans) involved anything like the massive, village-wide exterminations prevalent in the Euro-Indian wars.

As far as most historians can tell, Native warfare, though brutal, tended to be ritualized, involving night-time raids that primarily targeted adult males. Women and children were often left to their own devices to survive after these; I'm not implying this is fun stuff. However, Native wars tended to be extremely long-running, racially charged affairs involving tribal grudges that went back decades, if not hundreds of years.

Warfare after the advent of the Europeans, however, was an entirely different matter. Europeans practiced an entirely different breed of warfare; this is obvious from the first few large-scale massacres of Native populations, many of which involved Europeans encircling and then firing indiscriminately on undefended villages.

The introduction of firearms radically altered the balance of power that existed before the European advent, and warfare changed as a result. King Phillip's War, for example, almost pushed the Europeans back into the sea, a far different outcome than the first few lopsided victories the colonists had enjoyed. Native populations adopted European tactics, including the burning of settlements and attacks on civilians. Native tactics, such as night attacks, small raiding parties, and quick retreat into heavily wooded and swampy areas, combined with European firepower and ""Total Warfare,"" provided a powerful and entirely *new* method of warfare that almost stopped the advance of European culture.

I am not brainwashed, and the argument is not bullshit, but one that comes from intensive study of early American warfare. Cultures are not morally superior to one another; they simply possess different cultural characteristics.

,"&gt;For instance, would it not be a contradiction for me to say that I love black people but consider them to be a lower class of citizens?

It is in fact not a contradiction.  The idea of the [""white man's burden""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Man's_Burden) was a prevailing notion during the imperialist age.  The basic idea was, black people (and Indians, and Filipinos, etc.) are of a lower class; however, it is the moral (and Christian) duty of the white, ruling upper class of European nations to ""help"" them to ""advance their culture"".

For the majority of people I'd probably venture that this philanthropic viewpoint was simply a cover for racism, exploitation, etc.  However, some people actually endorsed it and believed in it.

TL;DR: it is possible to love someone while still considering them as lower than yourself.  The ability to do so is in my opinion one of the prime virtues of a good leader.

As a tangential aside, this is one of the many failings which Western democracy has imprinted on modern generations--the loss of gentrification means that people relate discrimination to bigotry automatically, and see discrimination as an inherently evil thing (almost a ""sin""?).

I am discriminatory.  I discriminate against stupid people.  This is not a bad thing.  

And I do not HATE stupid people inherently...it's not their fault.  I may hate the things they do, but hating the people is pointless.

These Christians are discriminatory in their notion of what is ""good"" and what is ""sin"".  They are NOT bigots.  Nor are they hateful.  And that is not a contradiction.  So I guess not so tangential after all, but whatever.  ",1278020863,c0tbv6c,False,,Moridyn,1426363703,0,t5_2qhh7,0,True,1,0,t1_c0tbv6c,False,t1_c0tastl,1,t3_cktpm,,lgbt

,"It was not reality of central Europe. It was the reality of the ENTIRE Europe at that time. 

And while Western monarchies were committing large scale religious cleansing, the Kingdom of Poland-Lithuania would ban religious discrimination by royal decrees and would accept and shelter Western Europe's refugees, e.g. Jews. Some of these decrees would get overturned on local level for some groups, based on current political situation, only to return when the power shifted.

Sure it was no earthly paradise nor a pinnacle of tolerance. The same Jews or other minorities that were given refuge by a monarch's decree would and were often attacked by local ""noble"" men. It was not a controlled, systemic issue but rather a pretty standard, economic attack by the ruling elites on ANYONE who they could extract money from. They would and did this to every poorer/weaker person simply because they could. Just like all the other robber barons all over Europe. 

Local feuds were a fact of life everywhere in Europe at that time and raiding your neighbors (regardless of their ethnicity or religion) was a standard practice to advance one's family's wealth, social standing, even marriage (there was a common practice of raiding for sole purpose of obtaining a wife of ""high"" lineage for instance). Some family feuds would go on for 100s of years and many outsiders who merely provided support to an opposing family would surely be caught in the mutual atrocities. Entire villages and townships would get razed due to the economic raids or family feuds.

,"[5] I need to watch myself when I say EU. Us Icelanders are a bit isolated here in the middle of the Atlantic ocean, so we are a bit ignorant when it comes to the ways of the EU. So I will just tell you how this happened here in Iceland.

From 1935-1998 the governmentally owned post and comunication service Póstur og Sími got split up and Landsíminn was formed [[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siminn). ""Póstur og Sími ( sími is telephone, the nn behind it is the same as using 'the' )had a monopoly on most telecommunications services until 1998. That year a new law came into effect and the market opened for competition."". In 2005 it was privatized [[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siminn). In 1996 Póst- og símamálastofnun ( post and telephone institution ) was formed. [[2]](http://pta.is/Default.aspx?cat_id=51). A governmentally run licensing and monitoring institute for postal and communication affairs. [[3]](http://www.althingi.is/lagas/138a/2003069.html). They enforce that the communication law[[4]](http://www.althingi.is/lagas/138a/2003081.html) is followed and by that law it forces that all owners of communication networks are required to offer all telecommunication companies access to their network and not to discriminate in bandwidth between the owners and ""renters"". Póst- og Símamálastofnun can use fines to enforces the communication law. They also control the maximum price a network owner can charge for access to it to stimulate competition [[3]](http://www.althingi.is/lagas/138a/2003069.html). 

IMHO after 2005 when Landsíminn was privatized ( now called Síminn ) they cut services to maximize gain and then the private companies didn't have to compete with the high standards of a governmentally run institute that didn't prioritize gains but service. I was highly against the privatization of it ( and also the banks, you all know what a fiasco that was ) and 5 years later, I am convinced that it was. Just like most of Scandinavia felt when the wave of privatization of governmental institutions where privatized that ended up giving consumers worse service for higher prices for the same reason I stated above. Privatization of healthcare would be the stupidest thing of them all. The evil politicians have not done much to take away any of these rights that I have talked about, but they battle against other rights, but thats another story. 

Had alot of fun researching this, if anyone wants more info ask and I will answer. 

tl; dr Communications and competition has been a legal right here since 1996 and is monitored and enforced by the government. Regulation of networks and guaranteeing competitors fair and affordable access to all networks is in the interest of consumers.

Expect a long line anywhere near lunch (I probably waited about 30minutes at 1:30).  Montreal is also known for their bagels and they are definitely tasty.

Take Arsenal for example. One of the best possession sides in Europe. Ok, admittedly they were given a spanking by Barcelona in the Champions League, but we're still talking about the Champions League. Look at Chelsea, beaten by the eventual winners, and by a manager who knows them inside out. Take Man Utd, regardless of them being beaten by Bayern Munich, they were destroying them in the first half of the second leg until they went a player down.

The premier league has some of the most advanced technical sides in the world, this is not hyperbole. Going back to Arsenal, we can see the problem for England is not that their players are not going to foreign teams, they're barely getting into their own teams.

,"Theres no need for all this conjecture, the statistics speak for themselves. [In nearly all modern industrial nations with working educational systems you see not just a trend away from christianity, but away from religion in general. The only outlier is the US.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_atheism)

Yes some fringe religions gain, their growth is drastic relative to their original size, but in absolute terms No-Religion or Secular has grown the most, and continues to do so.

I live in Australia, we are one of the least religious nations. Over 20% of  our population identify as non-theistic secularists and the percentage of Christians is dropping steadily every census. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Australia

Our current Prime Minister is an Atheist and our neighbour New Zealand's is an agnostic.

It's not a surprise really, the minute a country manages to achieve an intelligent society (roughly above 90 IQ points) [there is a *very sudden* shift away from religion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:LynnHarveyNyborg-CountryBelieveGod-Intelligence.svg). There is an inverse correlation between intelligence and religion, put simply: People realise its all bull shit. [Additional info.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religiosity_and_intelligence)

Even among those who still confess a belief in god, when asked 'Is religion important in your life?', the answer is increasingly 'No'.

You can find that statistic, among others relating to religiosity in Europe [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Europe).

The conclusion from this evidence is: The is an increasing trend away from religiosity in modern industrial nations AND this loss is not being made up for by new religions like you suggested.

,"When I was in Germany someone was sent to prison for persisting in teaching his dog to give the Hitler salute despite earlier attempts at re-education. The 'part Alsatian mongrel', Adolf, was sent for resettlement.

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/dogs-nazi-salute-lands-owner-in-jail-for-five-months-766438.html

&gt; As a dog lover, Hitler would no doubt have been flattered ""Adolf"" the part Alsatian mongrel was not only his namesake but also meticulously trained by his Berlin owner to raise his right paw in a Nazi salute every time the command ""Heil Hitler!"" was uttered.
&gt;
&gt; But in a country where giving the Nazi salute even in jest has been strictly verboten since 1945, Adolf's canine tricks did not amuse the police or the judiciary. 
&gt;
&gt; Yesterday his owner, a pensioner named as Roland T, was starting what seemed like a draconian prison term of five months for repeatedly displaying banned Nazi symbols. His pet was dispatched to one of the city's animal homes.
&gt;
&gt; The dog was pictured in newspapers and on Der Spiegel magazine's online site sitting in a kennel with the name ""Adolf"" chalked across its entrance. 
&gt;
&gt; Evamarie Knig, a spokeswoman for the kennel, said she hoped the animal would find a new home soon. ""He is healthy and obedient and we think he will find another owner quickly because he is so famous,"" she said. The dog is to be renamed Adi. 
&gt;
&gt; Roland T and his dog first attracted the attention of police in 2003 when the dog saluted as part of his owner's provocative public repertoires of banned Nazi gestures, including wearing Hitler T-shirts and chanting ""Sieg Heil"".
&gt;
&gt; Earlier this year, judges ruled that Roland T should serve a prison term after suspended jail sentences and fines failed to dissuade him from continuing to display Nazi symbols.",1278038530,c0tcfyj,True,,RabidRaccoon,1426363971,0,t5_2qh13,0,True,1,0,t1_c0tcfyj,False,t3_cl5cs,1,t3_cl5cs,,worldnews
,"&gt;Conscript armies are only good for one thing: cannon fodder.

If this were some third world country using the number of guys toting an AK as a legitimate metric for defense, I would agree with you. 

But this is Sweden. 

You are talking about a country with one of the oldest continuous forms of government on the planet; with one of, if not *the* highest, standards of living; and with one of the most educated populaces on earth; thus they present no threat to their neighbors and any assembly of conscripted troops are assumed to be for defense of national sovereignty only. This means that if their conscripts get called up, shit has gone south in a very bad way and the soldiers are smart enough to understand the threat and have a reason to fight against it. Sweden designs their national highways to serve as runways for military aircraft in the event of war - then they design and build the planes that land on those impromptu runways and keep track of the number of citizens able to maintain them. Their personnel and weapons are respectively trained, manufactured, and deployed all within their own relatively small borders - they rarely purchase arms from the US, Russia, or other European countries; so they are pretty self-sufficient. 

Dismissing this policy change as the simple elimination of ""cannon fodder"" is a severe underestimate of its import. After all... if you really had to point out a country without the ability to be productive and utilize resources, I don't think the home of IKEA would be first on the list.

&gt;certification ""(i.e. a [public] HS diploma)""...is subject to monopoly control. Do you agree?

Yes, I do.

&gt; Why is the government the only one capable of providing a ""formal"" education? My cousins graduated from a Catholic High School. Did they not receive a ""formal"" education?

They did.  They received a diploma from a state certified school.  In affect, the government still played a hand in legitimating their education because the school met some minimum standard.  Even if one home schools a child, they must pass tests in their states to prove that they've learned something.

&gt; If we're going to have a productive discussion, it's probably worthwhile to be clear about things. Can you please provide a definition for what you mean by ""justice"" because I am almost certain it is very different from the definition I might provide.

I think this is a fair point--and a powerful one for the libertarians.  I have no interest in 'planning' or forcing my just view of the world onto society.  In fact, in the spirit of a good discussion, let's leave the question of defining Justice-with a capital J--to the side.  Point taken.  However, I feel like I should put something on the table: let me try this. I think you and I believe in a similar form of classical liberal autonomy, that is the power of individuals to choose/make their lives as they see fit.  A just society is therefore one whereby political and social institutions maximize the choices available to individuals.  We disagree about the role of government: I believe that there is a more expansive role for the state, while you believe that market mechanisms are better suited to the task.  I am arguing here that because libertarians fail to understand how power works, they therefore misunderstand how markets work in the real world, not in the ideal.  That's the line that splits us.  Is that a fair characterization?

My particular example of power is forms of social/political/legal/economic discrimination in the South prior (and arguably after) the Civil Rights movement.  

To expand on this: let's follow through with your thought on hiring teachers in a free market to correct forms of discrimination.  I am going to speculate here what I think the ideal scenario you have in mind: parents who are frustrated by the ""separate but equal"" school hire teachers on a free-market to educate their children.  Yet, even with an excellent education, they are denied opportunities at white owned businesses--this was empirical the case.  It may be true that given enough time, market forces would do the work to wash away discrimination.  But, follow me for a moment.  The students therefore enter the market, competing with those who refuse to serve them/hire them.  If there is widespread racism, this will create a market segregated by skin color, white customers at the white businesses, black customers at the black businesses--only through a social change whereby customers feel comfortable at different stores would integration take place.  This type of segregated market endures in many parts of the world: Indian caste systems, Japanese outsiders, post-colonial integration in parts of Europe and arguably in parts of black America.  You're premising, I think, an ideal that in practice doesn't work out.

Now, you can play the ""that's-not-a-true-free-market"" card, and granted, in each of these instances, state interventions do operate in favor of a ruling class.  However, I would like to hear an instance where this type of free-market logic did work out--a significant example--one that could be generalizable to other social contexts.",1278045059,c0tcn4c,True,,[deleted],1426364066,0,t5_2qh63,0,True,1,0,t1_c0tcn4c,False,t1_c0tcarg,1,t3_cl07d,,Libertarian
,"Upped because anyone getting interested in tea is a good thing. :)

While it seems you like sweet teas what I say might not be very interesting to you, but if your interested in teas I think you might find it interesting. I'm by no means an expert myself, have been interested for maybe a couple of months or so (but I tend to get sort of passionate about these things, heh).

Before going into besserwisser mode I'd like to emphasise that if you think what your drinking taste good and if your enjoying it your doing it right, no matter what anybody else tells you.

A common rule of thumb for many, not all, tea enthusiasts is that:
Strawberry teas and other teas with added ingredients to change the taste are usually considered to be of low quality. Since the one drinking it won't feel just the taste from the tea leaves the quality of the leaves isn't as important. Fully appreciating the quality of the tea leaves is also the reason why many enthusiasts (again, not all) prefer to drink their tea without adding sugar or milk to it. Also, milk and cream ruin a lot of the antioxidants in tea, if you care about such things (I don't).

Now, that said let's talk about different types of tea. The tea you and most people in the US and europe are drinking is called black or crimson (hongcha) tea. Black being the english tea term and crimson being what they call it in asia, the only reason this terminology matters is because lapsang, puerh, liu bao and a bunch of other teas are called black in asia (heicha) with no corresponding term in English.

Some different kind of teas:

**White teas** This is the closest you can get to ""fresh"" tea leaves. It has a very mild flavour and is usually only steeped for maybe 20 seconds or so (though many prefer steeping it for as long as three, four or even five minutes).

**Black teas (heicha)** These usually have a very strong, bitter by some standards, flavour and depending on how you steep them they can get as black as coffee! It's a very interesting type of tea and even if you might not like it I would recommend trying it sometime. A good place to start is a ripe puerh (as opposed to a raw puerh which is much lighter). As a beginner price isn't very important, you can get quite an ok puerh quite cheap.

**Crimson teas (hongcha)**, commonly called black teas. This kind is the one most popular in the west by far. It is commonly believed that the best crimson teas are the one grown in the Darjeeling region of India (now days there is also a lot of non-crimson darjeeling teas, but if it just says darjeeling it's usually crimson). I'm not very fond of these myself, but I do have one from darjeeling which I find very pleasing. They usually have a little fruitier taste then one might be used to, despite not having added flavours. Also, be aware that there are a lot of fake darjeelings on the market.

**Green teas** I've heard a lot of people who think this is the only kind of tea apart from crimson tea and the one most popular in asia. After having read a lot about tea I'm not sure, though I might be wrong here, that it is the most popular in asia though it's definitely *one* of the most popular. Being sort of a Japan freak most of my experience with green tea comes from Japanese sencha and matcha (ground tea, very interesting and highly recommended) and even then it's limited.

**Wulong teas**, often spelled oolong (same word, just different romanizations). This is probably my favourite kind of tea though I dare say it's one of the teas you will absolutely ruin if you add sweeteners to it. In my opinion it goes for most teas but wulong is special. ;-) Widely viewed as the most aromatic tea and I think the one that requires the most work and skill to make good (make, not brew). There's huge variation within the category of wulong teas but from what I've gathered it's usually large leaves rolled either to stick-like or ball-like shapes. The steeping is very beautiful as the leaf will usually fold out and if you've got a good tea you can sometimes get very pretty, unbroken and unbruised leaves from this. One cheap but good wulong I've found is the Wuyi Qilan (available [here](http://cgi.ebay.com/Wu-Yi-Qi-Lan-Organic-Rare-Orchid-Oolong-100g-3-5-oz-/230370195566?cmd=ViewItem&amp;pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item35a322386e) at the Dragon Tea House eBay store for $14 / 100g which lasts a long time). When drinking I usually make at least five or six steepings from each pot, sometimes more.

**Herbal teas or tisanes** These beverages are not tea as they do not contain the tea plant, but they are tea-like infusions of other herbs which may or may not have the same stimulating effect as tea. One of my favourites being the South American beverage Mate (from the plant Yerba Mate) which is VERY high in caffeine. The first time drinking it it pretty much made me dissy. Cooled mugicha or roast barley tea is a very popular summer drink in Japan which may take some getting used to but it's very cheap and very good once you get used to it. I like it a lot.

Finally, a tip which ought to suit your sweet tooth extremely well! I usually do not view this as tea, though I guess it really is, but it's super tasty. **Masala Chai**. Literally ""spice tea"" is an indian tea blend usually using crimson tea mixed with spices. The tea is then actually *supposed* to be boiled with milk, water and sugar. You can probably get an OK taste of this to see if it's your thing at the nearest Starbucks as it's very popular, often under the name ""Chai Latte"". My advice if doing it at home would be to have not too much but a good deal of white sugar and some whole milk. It's truly wonderful!

Hope you found my breakdown of different kinds of tea useful. You'll quickly notice that there's an entire science built around tea and it's literally impossible to even have tried all variations within a sub-type of tea. You can spend your whole life drinking different kinds of tea and still have more to learn!",1278045188,c0tcn7p,True,,kaminix,1426364066,0,t5_2qq5e,0,True,25,0,t1_c0tcn7p,False,t3_cl6cy,25,t3_cl6cy,,tea

Free Wi-Fi basically didn't exist (I think there is some now). Hotels wanted quite a bit of money to get online.

In the US, it was competition from other places (hotels, coffee shops, Panera etc. with free Wi-Fi) that made the big guys wilt when their contracts ran out.

,"The birth rate is high in those countries because they are so underdeveloped, I think you'll find that as populations become more developed their birth rate drops. You can simulate this relationship using gapminder: http://www.gapminder.org/world/

That link will also show you that many/most of the countries in your list are starting to overcome their poverty, albeit slowly.

As they do so, they will become increasingly educated and secular, as history, and my links, have shown.

Europe was highly religious for most of the last several thousand years, it also had very high birth-rates. The industrial and cultural revolutions over the past 50 years have completely reversed that trend. The same is true of Japan and many other nations. As my links show, particularly Gapminder, the majority of poorer nations are now participating in a rapid development.

You point at industrialised nations and say: 'They're not important to my argument'. But you neglect their history: They were all once poor, high fertility and highly religious countries. Who are you to say that other nations cannot follow the same path?

I do not know where you live, but I assume you are an atheist, and I would assume that whatever nation you call home was and may still be high religious, but as an atheist, you are proof itself that people can and do change. If you call the US home, then you need only see this article: http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-03-09-aris-survey-nones_N.htm

Your argument is:

Poor Religious nations ---&gt; High Birth Rate ---&gt; Will out breed us ---&gt; Religion will continue to dominate into the distant future. ""religion is alive and well and will always be""

My argument is: 

The world is religious now ---&gt; Trend towards prosperity and intelligence ---&gt; Trend towards secularisation

I have given ample evidence which shows these trends as fact.

Your argument would only make sense and be true if no other nation was ever capable of raising its standard of living. The fact that Western Industrialised nations were not always so, along with many others, is proof that this is false.

Your argument ignores clear trends and predicates itself on that idea that people are not capable of progress. As I have shown, this is false.

They were dirt poor, had little to no education, and immediately took on the hardest of manual labor, especially construction jobs.

by 1900 they had begun to monopolize public sector jobs and Irish employed by the government shot up until they eventually dominated it by 1930. By the depression in 1933, the Jews (watch out for a reddit shitstorm) began to challenge the Irish for these jobs. The Jews, who had been around for a long time, (Many fled from European antisemitism from the 1880's to the early 1900's)  but not had serious clout in the public sphere, began to usurp teaching jobs in the U.S.

By 1920, two million Jews lived in New York City, which became the worlds largest Jewish city. Just in time for the explosion of factory jobs.
Although many fled in poverty, in rags, it became easier for (SOME OF) the poor Jews to move up due to the ""well-to-do"" community already established. 

The Jews began to monopolize commerce and clothing industries, increasing the opportunity for mobility amongst (SOME OF) themselves.

By the depression, the educated, middle class Jewish community began to look for opportunities in the public sector, as I have previously stated. 

The Jewish-Irish tensions reached it's peak here in the 1930's, but gradually subsided without serious conflict as they found a common adversary: The blacks.

The lower class jews were still vying for the lower class jobs, of course, and this included retail, particularly that which was concentrated in Harlem. Jewish store-owners would sell to blacks, but preferred not to employ them, until protests (in the 1930's) 

There were eventually riots in 1943, and blacks burned down many Jewish owned establishments in Harlem. This conflict reached it's peak in the 1960's. 

Unlike the blacks, Jewish folk had rapid upward mobility, and with a dwindling Jewish working class, the Jewish employers began to look for workers. Finally, it was time to hire other people to work for them. And who did they turn to? The Italians, of course!

Reluctantly, Jewish owners eventually hired blacks after World War II. 25k African Americans worked as garment workers (up from 5000 only 10 years previous) and blacks began to move into the sector once filled by the Irish, and then the Jewish immigrants. During this time, few blacks moved into the public sector (Civil Rights weren't even a twinkle in the nation's eye at this point) 

Why did it take this long, even before Civil Rights? Weren't Blacks here first?

In 1890 Blacks comprised only 1.6% of New York City. By 1920, there were only 150k blacks in New York--3% of the city's population.

Blacks did benefit from the United State's shut-off of immigration during WWI, and they did occupy factory jobs, but by 1924, they had been displaced, predominantly into domestic service positions. 

It wasn't until 1990 that 35% of native-born blacks entered the pubic sector--even amidst continuing ethnic struggle. They also comprised a quarter of the city's population. David Dinkins was the first African American mayor of NY city, elected that year. 

There is a long history of ""inter-ethnic"" struggle in the United States.

The Cubans, did not begin to enter the nation in large numbers until the mid-late 20th century, and the Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, etc., even later.

 I hope a picture is coming together at this point.

You mentioned Koreans. I'll try to explain that one shortly, because at this point, I might as well get in front of a classroom and lecture while you sleep.

In the 1960's the U.S. once again liberalized it's immigration laws. The reforms tilted towards those with ""kinship ties"" to current residents. Another emphasis was the 1965 reform which allowed educated immigrants--engineers, doctors, nurses, jobs with high demand and short supply--priority. An influx of well-educated and highly skilled Koreans dominated that spurt. 

They ""took over"" (I'm getting lazy with my lingo at this point) small storefronts, nail salons, etc. By 1980, already a third of Korean Males were self employed.

Although smaller than the ""white immigrant"" populations of yore, the Korean immigrants were better able to utilize their connections in Korea to develop commercial activity.

Of course, once again, in the 1990's tensions peaked between the newly economically dominant Koreans selling to, but not hiring, blacks in their own neighborhoods. (The Koreans would hire other Korean immigrants).

There was a boycott of two Korean stores in the Flatbush area of Brooklyn. Hilariously (depending on your sense of humor) although theo customer base dropped off, the two stores were kept open for four months based on financial support from the organized Korean community.

Of course, this only touches on the history. You could take course after course after course over many years and still not understand the full picture of our history.

Few even care to try. Even fewer have the privilege.

,"I live in Toronto and a number of my friends are recent immigrants, so I'll try to answers your concerns.

Living Standards: Are equal to the first world normal. Toronto and Vancouver usually score in the top ten most livable cities.

Attitude to Foreigners: Toronto is probably the most accepting city on the planet for foreigners. Most of us in the city are immigrants or children of immigrants.

IT work for Europeans: There is work. Finding a good job might take some time. A friend of mine came from Russia with weak English skills and landed a good IT job after six months. He did have to do a stint a McDonalds before he got the IT job.

Visa: Canada is pretty much the easiest first world country to get into. I don't know the work visa program, but for permanent residents the skilled worker program is the usual way people get here.

Kids: The schools are provincially run, so my comment will apply to Toronto and not Vancouver. The school system works reasonable well. The quality of the education you get is more dependent on the individual teachers then the system itself. We do have to parallel public school systems so you can ""shop"" for schools.

,"Yeah, they are. You can mock the idea that a political movement can achieve power, but it does happen from time to time. The anti-nuclear movement was a very powerful constituent of the Democratic party (which I mostly agree with, but not on this issue) during the 70s and 80s, and are still fairly powerful today (e.g. the most powerful liberal think-tank, the Center for American Progress, is very anti-nuclear and is still [putting out misinformation regarding nuclear power](http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/2008/nuclear_power_report.html)).

In the US, anti-nuclear protesters have caused many plants to get delayed to the point of cancellation. 

For example:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoreham_Nuclear_Power_Plant#Mounting_protests

Note how even the Governor of New York was involved with blocking the plant. Now instead, of having an 820 MW reactor, that site has a 100 MW natural gas generator and two 50 kW wind turbines, as well as a transmission line connected to Connecticut to make up for the lost power.

The anti-nuclear movement has also been very effective at lobbying Congress to cancel funding for breeder research, including the Clinch River breeder reactor and the Integral Fast Reactor.

The EU has a similar situation. Many countries there have banned building reactors due to anti-nuclear protests. Germany and Sweden had both passed nuclear-phase out bills (but later canceled them when they realized they couldn't replace the power their reactors generated).

So, yes. Overall the anti-nuclear movement has been very effective at stopping progress in nuclear power.

As for the rest of the world, nuclear power is complex and has high up-front costs, so these places tend to go with coal. Although recently places like China and Vietnam are getting rich enough that they are planning large nuclear buildups. For example, China is planning on building [132 reactors in the next 20 years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_china).

But overall, TMI and Chernobyl scared the shit out of people, even though TMI didn't kill anyone and Chernobyl killed a very small number of people compared to the number of people that die due to fossil fuels usage.

Luckily, since global warming and energy security are more important today than baseless fears against technology, much of the environmental movement (especially in the US Democratic party) has come around and we are going to start building reactors again in the US, as well as in many other countries.",1278055265,c0tcx0c,True,,ElectricRebel,1426364193,0,t5_2qhkd,0,True,1,0,t1_c0tcx0c,False,t1_c0tcvox,1,t3_cl2i4,,energy
,"Very well put. To me, 'anime' is just short for 'Japanese animation'. Nobody would say ""I think *French film* should refer to a style of cinema rather than be defined by the race or ethnicity of the makers"", so I can't understand why people do say that about anime.

The lines are blurry even with that definition, of course. There were several shows in the 70s and 80s that were made with European money and partly/mainly for European audience (I linked to one: *Alfred J. Kwak*). I like to count them as anime now, and why not: Japanese companies made similar shows just for the Japanese market too (*World Masterpiece Theater* series). But nobody thought of them that way when they first aired in Europe. 

*Afro Samurai* is a more recent example: it's based on a manga and it's animated in Japan, but it had an American voice cast and was first shown in the USA. Or what to make of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within? (I didn't even think to link to any pure CGI in my list above, lets fix that here

If you know you love him but you're not *feeling* it, is it because you no longer feel this way about him but your mind is telling you you do, or is it just because you're tired of missing him so much?

I've been in a long distance relationship for about a year and half now, and in that time we've been together in person no more than a month, but we still love each other insanely, and he'll be back here permanently sometime next year.

,"I can assure you that I am most definitely not Greenspan nor do I share any of the hard core assumptions associated with his belief system. In fact, most mainstream economists would agree that there is a difference between European states and the American government - of course that would the the extent of the agreement but nonetheless they can identity a difference between the two moentary systems.

What I am saying is actually quite controversial: A government in a monetary system characterised by floating exchange rates and non-convertible currency - a currency monopolist - has a number of significant operational advantages. Firstly, taxes dont finance government spending - they create demand for government liabilities. Secondly, bonds and other forms of securities issued are merely interest rate maintenance operations -in fact the New consensus within monetary economics would attribute bonds issued *solely* by the central bank as having this feature too, of course they would disagree that it applies to the whole government - and do not finance anything. This all leads to the conclusion that governments do not finance operational constraints, they may face real constraints (e.g. supply constraints -&gt; inflation) and political constraints (treasury is required to offset all deficit spending by issuing a bond equal to the difference between 'revenue' and 'expenses'). 

&gt;I think all I would say to that is while technically probably true, once you stop discounting the influence of politics and national interest of all countries involved the end result while not technically being called bankruptcy probably doesn't feel any better to the citizens of the country involved.

Well the thing is some countries are operational constrained, for instance european countries and they could technically default due to operational reasons - inability to extinguish or meet liabilities; as they do not issue their own currencies. America could never face this problem as it would pay for any of its debt the same way it always spends, by issuing its own liabilities (and if these liabilities meant that the private sector has an excessive reserve position then coordination between the treasury and the central bank would lead to a number of oeprations taken to drain the excess reserve position). 

I agree with your sentiment at the end. At the end of the day whether or not a country defaults from political or operational reasons the consequences can be potentially devastating.

First, this whole thing of religion against gay marriage is typically American, in a lot of countries, nobody gives a shit about religion and gay marriage still doesn't exist.


Second, gays not being able to marry doesn't imply non-equal rights. There are civil unions that provide the same rights in a lot of countries, they're sometimes even better. For instance, in France, the PACS has become very common as a replacement for marriage, even for heterosexual couples: more than 95% of the couples that use PACS are heterosexual, ""pacser"" has become a verb like marier etc. There's a general trend towards civil unions replacing marriages and that's probably a good thing.


I remember that Laurent Ruquier, a famous gay French anchorman used to explain that he was against homosexual marriage, because marriage was so associated with old fashioned, bigoted religious ideas and traditions and he didn't want to associate with that. Also marriage has meant ""the union between a man and a woman"" for millenia, so now we're creating something new, what's wrong with calling it differently? The real matter is whether civil unions provide the same rights as marriage, which they obviously do.


But there's probably a cultural factor too, I mean, I've never heard of gays protesting for gay marriage around here, each time I hear of this it's in the US or something. My point is, I'm not sure gays themselves want to marry here, they probably prefer pacsing themselves since it has a modern ring to it and isn't associated with religion or old bigoted crap. So not calling it ""marriage"" seems to make everyone happy, from gays to old fashioned bigots.


Then again, if gays themselves want to marry like it's the case in the US, then why not, I don't care.

EDIT: More on the fantasy of fast breeder reactors:

1. ""The International Panel on Fissile Materials ... argues that the track record of all fast breeder reactor programs demonstrates that sodium-cooled reactors cannot serve as a major part of the long-term nuclear waste disposal solution. ...""fast breeder"" reactors already have been the focus of more than $50 billion in development spending, including more than $10 billion each by the U.S., Japan and Russia. ... none of these efforts has produced a reactor that is anywhere near economically competitive with light-water reactors ... After six decades and the expenditure of the equivalent of tens of billions of dollars, the promise of breeder reactors remains largely unfulfilled and efforts to commercialize them have been steadily cut back in most countries. The reactors have been plagued by high costs, often multi-year downtime for repairs, multiple safety problems, and unresolved proliferation risks."" http://www.fissilematerials.org/blog/2010/02/history_and_status_of_fas.html

,"Tatertotty, you're obviously not aware of the situation in Europe. It's like this. The Scandinavian governments (and the EU) believe in a feminist ""gender equality"". What they mean is that women should be equally autonomous. But being a housewife isn't thought to grant women the power of autonomy - after all, housewives are financially dependent on their husbands and housewives do not have direct political power or financial influence.

So the idea is to ""unisex"" things - to make patterns of parenting and working life exactly the same for men and women. This requires, first, denying that there might be natural differences between men and women underpinning traditional differences. That's why a minister in the Swedish government, Jens Orback, declared the following to be official government policy:

&gt;The government considers female and male as social constructions, that means gender patterns are created by upbringing, culture, economic conditions, power structures and political ideology.

The Swedish government has ""mainstreamed"" this idea of gender equality - the unisexing of work and family -  meaning that it is considered in every government policy decision.

Tax policy is one way that the European governments make stay-at-home motherhood less possible. To give you some idea of how brazen this is, consider the following quote from a document prepared by a Swedish consultant for the EU:

&gt;Simple revenue-neutral reforms that shift some of the tax-burden from two earner couples to one-earner and/or zero-earner couples would reduce the distortion of second earner labour supply and may generate substantial welfare gains. In a majority of countries, it is possible to transfer one (1) euro to two-earner couples by taking less than half (0.5) a euro from other couples""

What's being argued is that tax should be used to distribute income from male breadwinner families to dual income families  - despite the fact that dual income families will have a larger overall income.

It's just assumed at government level in Europe that gender equality does not mean equal choice or equal opportunity but instead a shift in society toward unisex life roles in which both the father and mother work full-time and take the same number of months off for their paid parental leave.",1278068560,c0td4ln,False,,melb22,1426364292,0,t5_2qhk3,0,True,0,0,t1_c0td4ln,False,t1_c0td0yl,0,t3_ckydh,,MensRights

,"My last boss.

I was with the company for nearly two years writing software used in the retail and logistics sectors. I hated the job so much. The work was OK, but my boss was a nutcase.

He was cheap, played weird mind games with everyone and had a complete disregard of business/copyright/IP law. He went to a conference and seen some software he liked, he came back and ordered us to make an exact duplicate so that he could sell it.

Anyways, he made me redundant in February. I was happy with that. I was out of the job I hated and I was able to claim full Jobseekers Allowance. 

Unbeknownst to my ex-boss, I had arranged an interview with one of his biggest rivals. My ex-bosses company was until a few years ago the only company in Ireland making our type of software, the rival company was from England and was only going after new business. They were making no attempt to tempt customers away from my old boss. Despite this, my ex-boss held the extremely paranoid view that they were stealing his customers.

I had made the mistake of telling a colleague I though I could trust that I was being interviewed by the rival company. He promised to keep it hush-hush. Later I learned that was a mistake as he told me ex-boss. I got an email from the colleague saying ""Sorry I had to tell xxx you were being interviewed by xxx"". He heard a rumour and threatened to sack me if I didn't spill the beans.

A few weeks after my redundancy kicked in I was out of the country at a friends wedding and I started receiving a stream of weird and threatening texts from my old boss. They went like this...

""Robert, you are in a dangerous situation and things are looking bad for you. Act now to prevent harm to you and your family"" ""Robert I am coming to your home tomorrow to discuss this, be in at 10am, or else"" ""Robert, I will go to the police if you do not talk to me"". My response to all these were to email him saying that I haven't the foggiest notion of what he is talking about and that I was out of the country, along with a warning that future communications from him would be reported to the Gardai (our police). 

The next day I got the following text ""Robert, I am at your door, let me in now!"", several similar texts followed in quick succession.

When I got back home a few days later there was a letter waiting for me from my ex boss that could be summarised as :

* You are going to work for a rival and I will not allow that.
* You have stolen all our code and have taken it our rival.
* You are going to work with our rival to destroy us.
* You know of multiple security vulns in our online systems and you plan to tell our rival about these and exploit them.
* I will sue/prosecute you unless you sign a confession and agree not to work for our rival.

It was all very, very paranoid. Suffice to say none of his allegations had a single shred of truth to them. 

I went to my solicitor straight away and had a restraining order placed on him. Two days after it was granted he violated it by coming to my home again. Luckily for him everyone was out. He's a weak, skinny man with numerous illnesses. I am a stocky rugby player who does not like his family being threatened. He spent a night in the cells for that breach.

A few days later he had the nerve to call my solicitor and say that he thought I wasn't taking the matter very seriously - before going off on a 2 hour long paranoid ramble about how I was trying to destroy him. My solicitor pointed out that only one party in this affair had retained legal counsel - me, and that he was making loads of allegations and demands yet refusing to call in the police or retain a solicitor. He was told to go ahead and sue or STFU.

Right now I am suing my ex-boss for wrongly redundancy (he replaced me with a cheaper non-EU developer within a week), harassment and libel as he called the MD of the rival company to bad mouth me.

,"Wow.  How do they justify it?  I have this client that was like that who would use a workstation until it finally broke down of old age and wasn't worth repairing, and even then they would only replace the computer, not the monitor.  One day while on-site I gave the owner a small demonstration using a device called a kill-a-watt, it plugs in-line between outlet and the device you'd like to measure and it tells you the power usage, watts, amps, etc.  The 19-in CRT we tested used 140w while on, 15w in standby and 3w just plugged in and turned off.  We then pulled up the energy star database at [www.eu-energystar.org](http://www.eu-energystar.org) - most LCD's they'd consider fell in the range consuming 18-24 watts while on, and less a fraction of a watt in standby/off - some as low as 0.1 watt.  We called their accounting and asked what they were paying for electricity from their last utility bill, did some math and worst case, paying average retail for a new LCD it would pay for itself in less than 6 months, never mind buying one on sale or with a rebate.  Shipping LCD's is far cheaper than CRT's.  And then there's heat, too - if you're in a warm climate it'll cost more to cool a building full of CRT's than LCD's.  If you're in a cold climate, the CRT's would give off some warmth and lower your heating costs, but I think there are more efficient heating methods than warm electronics.",1278076332,c0tda7a,True,,gr8sk8,1426364379,0,t5_2qh0u,0,True,4,0,t1_c0tda7a,False,t1_c0td131,4,t3_cl6s6,,pics

I felt like I wrote this story myself about my life. I married a Russian woman in Europe and brought her into the United States. We lived in Naples, FL for the first two years of our marriage. After a visit from an older Russian woman (who lived between NYC and Miami), my ex-wife ""needed"" us to move to Indianapolis. I fought it but she caused significant issues for me with my employer. After relocating to Indianapolis, she immediately starting hanging around with her new Russian friends. In December of 2003, she abandoned her family and flew to NYC to meet two Russian cousins she had been talking to a lot over the phone. She returned from this meeting five days later (in early January). She wasn't the same person when she returned. I had to take a 9mm handgun from her later that month when she tried to kill me with it. We lived in the same house after that -- but separate bedrooms. She had her own separate life away from me and the children. On the day she got her green card in March of 2005, she took both children and disappeared. I know the two cousins gave her a lot a money at different times to pay for her medical school. She was required to finish medical school and be ""available"" anytime for medical support to her new Russian friends -- gunshot wounds, etc. Most of her contacts had something to due with Fencing (sword fighting). This group of people were a little different that the ones she had been with before. These were Ukranians. She had been living in Indianapolis and working in a research lab at IUPUI until this story first broke. She disappeared with the children again. So far, I have not been able to find her or my children. There are a lot more than ten Russian spies operating in the USA. They have a massive network that is being to rival that of Israel.

Also, U.S. interests may have spurred the Japanese to attack us, but on the whole WWII was the result of militaristic aggression on the part of Japan and Germany which stemmed from their respective recent histories. Germany had never accepted its defeat in WWI and succumbed to the notion that they had been stabbed in the back by their homefront (the solution being to have a racially pure and united civilian population before going to war again). This is an over simplification of the German motives, but the European war can be blamed wholly on them. Japan had been flexing its muscles ever since the Meiji Restoration and its subsequent industrialization. While it was U.S. interests that motivated FDR to promulgate an oil embargo, one cannot argue that attempting to peacefully stop the Japanese conquest of Asia was a bad idea.

,"A freind and I were sitting at a bar in Hamburg, Germany in 2001, I cna't remember the name of the bar. We had been in the same bar for about two hours drinking and talking to a couple of girls going to college in the city, when this huge man walks in with another girl. The girls we were chatting up knew her and the man, and they joined us at our table. The guy was being pretty quiet and putting away beers like I've never seen before. 
Soon after this huge man (we will call him Hans) had polished off probably his 7th or 8th beer, in walks a group of three men, all wearing the same jacket and looking around like they are looking for someone. They spot Hans at our table and come straight for him with scowls on their faces. He spots them coming over and mutters something under his breath, but quickly looks up with a smile and greets them. They start to argue in a langauge that I don't know (I speak German fluently and can recognize most European languages,) they are starting to get pretty loud. I ask the girl that came with him what's going on and she just shakes her head at me and waves for me to be quiet. At this point everyone in the bar is watching this argument going on, getting louder and louder by the minute. Hans eventually just waves these guys off, like get out of here I'm done talking to you. 
Suddenly one of the three guys lunges and stabs Hans in the leg with a folding knife, drives this thing all the way in, and then jumps back, leaving it in this huge thigh.
With a look of shock on his face, Hans slowly looks down at it and then back at the guy that stabbed him. He reaches down and pulls the knife out of his leg, which right away starts to bleed all over the place. He stands up and drops the knife, where the point sticks in the wood flooring. He grabs the guy who stabbed him by the front of his shirt and lifts him up a good two feet from the floor and walks out the front door with him in the air, followed slowly by the other two that had come in with Mr. Stabby. Hans sets the guy down right outside the door and punches him so hard that everyone inside the bar cringes. I thought that little guys head was going to come off. He turns to the other two and just stares at them for a minute... finally they pick up Mr. Stabby, who now has a much flatter nose, and they run as fast as two people can while carrying a limp body between them.
Hans walks back into the bar and sits right back down where he was right next to me and my freind. No one in the bar says a thing for what felt like an eternity, but was probably closer to a full minute, until his girlfreind asks if he wants her to call the police. He replys quietly, saying ""Ja, bitte."" (Yes, please.) This pretty much broke the spell everyone was under, and at this point everyone starts rushing around. The bartender grabs a hand full of rags and bring them over to try to stop the bleeding, and I think about 10 people called the police all at once, it was quite a scene. The police arivved promptly and questioned everyone about what had happened. An ambulance arrives and the medics tend to Hans' leg. The entire time, Hans never moves from his chair and continues to drink his beer. The police seem to be satisfied that everyones stories mached and they soon left, presumably to look for Mr. Stabby and his freinds. The medics wanted Hans to go to the hospital for stitches, but he refused, and they used some dermal glue and bandages to close the hole in his leg.

Then with the language barrier everything needed to go through a few people.  Then after spending huge sums of money on me he completely through a fit and did a hit job.  He didn't have any good reasons although he did use his bad ones.  In the end he simply demanded that they fire me or he would leave.

,"First, secede/succeed is a hilarious freudian slip or spelling mistake on your part.

Second, the secessionist movement in Canada could be a good starting point. The separatists here started in the 70s and have had two referenda to decide on whether to stay or not. Both times, it was voted down, but only narrowly. This has prompted a lot of debate, propaganda, threats etc... but all of these were peaceful. The net effect has been two things. 1) the political dynamics of the country changed since the separatists are a strictly regional party. All of the other parties pander to Quebec to try and buy Quebecer votes and any party that is successful will win the election. Until that happens we have minority governments (uphill battle to power requiring compromise). 2) Basically all of the grievances that began the movement have been addressed. Quebec has really clawed back a lot of 'states rights' and while separatism is no longer broadly popular (most people want it to go away), the parties that started it are popular.


As to logistics, projection, international relations etc... These are all on the negotiating table with the federal government, and in all likelihood it never gets to this stage. I would say the best case scenario is to become more like a country in the EU. I.E. what the US was supposed to be. The worst case scenario is for the bible-mashers to wage all out war on the separatists paying for their slovenly lifestyle.

               enslaved Europe and tried to take 
               over the world!

     A spotlight goes on. We see a wax figure of Charlie Chaplin 
     in his classic Tramp costume, his arm extended in a Nazi 
     salute amidst a mishmash of various other historical 
     perversions.

,"Let me put this in perspective for you.... I would be upset if my fiance didn't let me skip my wedding so I could see Daft Punk play live in the US.

Ultra Music Festival (the biggest EDM festival in the world, as far as the number of big name DJs that play) has offered them well over 6 figures to play their festival the last few years to no avail. I've heard numbers as high as $500,000. I would wager it would take over a million to make them play. They haven't toured in a long time.

Thomas Bangaltar (1/2 of Daft Punk) has been spotted on the decks a handful of times in the last year and it's always at some big time club in Europe and it always makes the front page of all of the EDM websites when it happens. There is a video of him on youtube with Ed Banger, Atrak, and several other big name DJs standing around him going nuts about him on the decks.

Ninja Edit: Found the [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCq-M3iHIJA).
Edit #2: And [another](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxVHeE6n8I)!

,"&gt; Conscripts are those who are forced into the fighting force without their concent or their will to defend their home country or ideals.
&gt; Such an force is also often under trained, under provisioned and lack the dermination of a killer.

Not quite accurate. What you describe is a subset. ""Those who are forced into the fighting force"" is 100% correct. 

But lets look at, say, many of those in, say, German, Finnish armies of WW2.

Lacking consent? Don't think so. Certainly there were grumblers in the ranks, but those always exist and don't really matter if 80% are by-and-large ok with being where they are (not a lot of desertions from either military until it was obvious the war was impossible to win).

Will to defend their home country or ideals? Seemed quite abundant, considering the sort of odds the armies were willing to take on.

Under trained? I would dare say both armies (the Finnish basically being trained by a German trained officer core) were better trained than any other on the planet, something that Western historians agree with.

Under provisioned? Perhaps somewhat compared to the Western armies, though the higher training resulted in a kill ratio that STILL favored the Germans when fighting Western forces.

Lack the determination of a killer? They might be some of the only armies for hundreds of years that might have killed more soldiers than they mobilized themselves during the whole course of the war.

&gt; Sure, there were many fiercesome armies made mostly up of conscripts but how many of those were alive and well enough to resume their interupted lives when the conflicts were over? Depends on the length of the conflict but the usual rule was that it werent many that fit that description.

Of course lots get hurt, but it's curious how well for example the conscript happy Germany that got mauled so hard twice first managed to rise from ashes to make the whole world quake between 1923 and 1939 and then from even worse ashes to again dominating the European continent for all intents and purposes after WW2...

,"Please, do you like to suffer?  Do you realize that there are other humans like you? They probably don't like to suffer either.  It is a really simple syllogism.

As to the atrocities of the 20th century, these were ordered by evil men, religious, atheist or indifferent.  Hitler and many (if not most) of his men were Roman Catholics, their belt buckles read ""Gott mit Uns"" (""God with Us"" in German) and his birthday was celebrated in Catholic Churches until his death.

Stalin and Mao were taking advantage populations that for centuries had believed that their leaders were more than just human.  Obviously their actions were evil, but you cannot charge atheism with these evil acts, they were power seeking acts designed to solidify a power base.  These men were no more evil than imperialist Christians that wiped out or subjugated native populations around the world, they just enacted their atrocities more recently, once reporting was better.

On the other hand, the wars in Europe from (lets be generous) 1000 C.E. to the early 20th century were largely religious conflicts.  While atheism cannot be blamed for the actions of leaders solidifying their power, theism can, indeed must, take the blame for wars started for the sake of conversion, or cleansing.

&gt; A NeXT Computer was used by Berners-Lee as the world's first web server and also to write the first web browser, WorldWideWeb, in 1990. By Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web:[7] the first web browser (which was a web editor as well); the first web server; and the first web pages,[8] which described the project itself. On August 6, 1991, he posted a short summary of the World Wide Web project on the alt.hypertext newsgroup.[9] This date also marked the debut of the Web as a publicly available service on the Internet. The first server outside Europe was set up at SLAC to host the SPIRES-HEP database. Accounts differ substantially as to the date of this event. The World Wide Web Consortium says December 1992,[10] whereas SLAC itself claims 1991.[11][12] This is supported by a W3C document entitled A Little History of the World Wide Web.[13]

,"So ignoring the fact that he wanted Germany to suffer mass starvation, destroy their economy HARDCORE again cause yeah, it totally worked well the first time. Also ignoring the fact that although he was gonna allow for some exports back to Japan, when his ambassador completely cut them off, he never tried to reconnect in anyway, which leads me to believe that this was part of his gameplan although he was in the Atlantic at the time.

UFC 116, Brock Lesnar e Shane Carwin lutam pela unificação do cinturão

O brasileiro Wanderlei Silva não vai mais lutar por problemas na costela
 
Oficial UFC/Assessoria de Imprensa



O dia 3 de julho, data que antecede a comemoração da independência dos EUA, promete agitar Las Vegas. O peso pesado Brock Lesnar enfrenta o maior desafio de sua carreira. Ele defende seu cinturão contra o jovem Shane Carwin, um dos maiores talentos da organização e campeão interino dos pesados, na edição 116 do maio campeonato de MMA do mundo, neste sábado, dia 03 de julho, no MGM Grand Garden Arena em Las Vegas. Depois de fraturar duas costelas durante seu treinamento, o lutador brazuca Wanderlei Silva foi substituído por Chris Leben para enfrentar o japonês Yoshihiro Akiyama. O card principal também contará com os seguintes duelos: Matt Brown vs. Chris Lytle, Stephan Bonnar vs. Krzysztof Soszynski e Kurt 'Batman' Pellegrino vs. George Sotiropoulous.
 
 
No Brasil, o show será exibido ao vivo no Combate às 23h, e também em alta definição no Combate HD. Uma hora antes, o assinante do canal à la carte especializado em lutas da Globosat, confere o UFC Countdown, programa que traz toda a preparação dos principais lutadores da noite.

“Quando me perguntam por que a categoria peso pesada capta a imaginação dos fãs, eu digo que é por causa de caras como o Brock Lesnar e Shane Carwin”, disse o presidente do UFC Dana White. “Eles não são apenas bons atletas e ex-campeões de wrestling, mas ambos têm a habilidade de finalizar a luta com apenas um soco. Essa será uma daquelas lutas que não se pode tirar o olho porque em meio segundo ela pode acabar”, completou.

Vencedor de três lutas importantes contra Frank Mir, Randy Couture e Heath Hearing, Brock Lesnar conseguiu se posicionar no topo da categoria pesada. Campeão nacional pesado da NCAA de wrestling em 2000, ele conquistou o título com um impressionante nocaute técnico no segundo assalto contra Randy Couture no UFC 91.  Em seguida, o lutador de 120 kg fez a sua primeira defesa de cinturão com sucesso parando Frank Mir no UFC 100. Mas agora Lesnar encara seu oponente mais perigoso, Shane Carwin.

“Estou ansioso para voltar ao octógono e defender o meu cinturão dos pesos pesados, disse Brock Lesnar. Estou pronto para lutar. No UFC 116, Shane Carwin vai encarar o verdadeiro campeão dos pesos pesados. Eu vou acabar com o recorde perfeito de Shane e sair do octógono com o meu título”, disse.
 
Desde 2008 no UFC, Shane Carwin derrotou todos os seus cinco adversários no primeiro assalto. Sua última vitória contra Frank Mir lhe assegurou o título interino dos pesos pesados aos 3 minutos e 48 segundo. “Eu sempre quis uma chance para competir com Brock Lesnar, um atleta de elite perigoso. Eu serei o seu primeiro adversário com o mesmo tamanho. Essa é a maior luta da minha vida e poderá ser uma das melhores lutas da história do UFC. Quero ser o verdadeiro campeão dos pesos pesados do UFC”, disse Carwin.
 
Yoshihiro Akiyama enfrenta Chris Leben
 
O brasileiro Wanderlei Silva, que estava escalado para enfrentar o japonês Yoshihiro Akiyama, fraturou duas costelas em um treinamento e foi substituído por Chris Leben. O oriental fará sua segunda luta no campeonato de artes marciais mistas mais famoso do mundo, depois de uma vitória contra Alan Belcher na divisão dividida dos juízes. Outros duelos esperados pelos fãs de MMA são Krzysztof Soszynski X Stephan Bonnar e George Sotiropoulos X Kurt Pellegrino.
 
Vindo de três derrotas (a última contra o seu atual adversário Krzysztof Soszynski), Stephan Bonnar nunca foi esquecido depois de sua batalha contra Forrest Griffin na final da primeira temporada do The Ultimate Fighter em 2005. No dia 03 de julho, a revanche contra Krzysztof Soszynski no UFC 116 pode significar a sua redenção.  

Invicto no campeonato desde 2007, com cinco vitórias (apenas uma por decisão), o australiano George Sotiropoulos enfrenta o Batman de New Jersey, especialista em wrestling e jiu-jitsu. Pellegrino tem seis vitórias por finalização e tem nas mãos a grande chance de acabar com a invencibilidade do australiano.
 
Card Principal: 

Brock Lesnar X Shane Carwin
Chis Leben X Yoshihiro Akiyama
Chris Lytle X Matt Brown
Krzysztof Soszynski X Stephan Bonnar
George Sotiropoulos X Kurt Pellegrino

Ukraine country side is rather beautiful but is being plagued by extreme poverty and neglect. There are no government policies that would support farmers and farming, politicians are mainly busy divvying up stolen Russian gas. This is a shame as the area used to be one of the richest agricultural regions in the world and serve as a breadbasket not only to Russia but to it's European neighbors as well.
In the country you're safe eating/drinking anything that locals do - Ukrainian cuisine is delicious, somewhat similar to Italian in it's use of spices and flavors. Do be careful with local moonshine - it won't poison you but might give you one hell of the hangover. One thing locals are fond of is ""salo"" - think spic, only fatter. I must say that when it's freshly made and eaten the way it should be - on dark rye, with an onion - it is rather delicious.

1) It's a bit of a reactionary backlash against the formality and density of dominant European Catholicism by immigrants. The people who immigrated = the people who already have problems with intellectuals.

2) American Protestantism developed on the frontier, by itinerant (and largely uneducated) preachers speaking to illiterate settlers, making it more a religion of personal experience and special revelation than theology and doctrine.

""[Legally blind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness)"" is not the same thing as ""unable to see"":

&gt;`In order to determine which people may need special assistance because of their visual disabilities, various governmental jurisdictions have formulated more complex definitions referred to as legal blindness.[2] In North America and most of Europe, legal blindness is defined as visual acuity (vision) of 20/200 (6/60) or less in the better eye with best correction possible. This means that a legally blind individual would have to stand 20 feet (6.1 m) from an object to see it—with corrective lenses—with the same degree of clarity as a normally sighted person could from 200 feet (61 m). In many areas, people with average acuity who nonetheless have a visual field of less than 20 degrees (the norm being 180 degrees) are also classified as being legally blind. Approximately ten percent of those deemed legally blind, by any measure, have no vision. The rest have some vision, from light perception alone to relatively good acuity.`",1278106613,c0tefou,False,,AnteChronos,1426364917,0,t5_2qh61,0,True,2,0,t1_c0tefou,False,t1_c0teap1,2,t3_clb92,,WTF

,"I'd be interested to know where you come from. I regard yours as an ""American view"", in that liberty and freedom of the individual is such a US cornerstone. Europeans, however, tend to view themselves as building a society together, and as having a debt to the state - ""a debt to the state"" being a synonym for ""a debt to each other"".

Americans tend to be critical of welfare and view the culture around it in a negative light (so much so that I've seen redditors posting to say that they're getting desperate and considering claiming it - *despite* the fact they've been out of work and eligible for welfare for months). Europeans have a pride in having their social programmes, and regard the use of them as a right.

There have been a few comments that have explained this better than I have time to right now. [This is one](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/cl1p5/sweden_ends_compulsory_military_service/c0tcwlt), but I'm sure there are others I can't immediately find, returning as I am to the thread after 8 hours.

There is a precedent for non-military conscription - in Germany conscientious objectors are obliged to work the hospital wards. A number of the German students I shared digs with at uni had done this (which is where I got the idea), maintained they'd had a good time doing it (""what parties we had!""), and stated that the German public health system would fall apart without it. Whether that last point is true or not, it's evidence that they took pride in their service. I believe that in Israel women may choose to do other services, rather than their 2-year military conscription - I chatted once with a girl who was going to work as a kind of teaching assistant or school advisor.

One thing I do believe is that our British society and public services are so fucked up that something fairly radical is needed in order to save them. The police routinely lie and believe that they're above the law, and the answer to that is not simply to impose harsh sanctions on them for such crimes - if we do that they'll just end up feeling like scapegoats, banding together to conceal the problems and we'll all end up worse from it. What we need to do is destroy the ""them and us"" mentality - not only will having members of the public more involved with them and seeing the problems they face help that, but it will also act as a check upon them.

Likewise we only ever see the National Health Service when we're ill or old, and it's too late then to improve it - the NHS's problems are too easily pushed out of our minds in daily life. There tends to be resentment in our society against the unemployed, blaming them for their circumstances, and this has led to the current freeze on benefits. I'm not saying it's a good thing for a teenage girl to have 2 or 3 kids before she's 20, but once she's made that mistake, there's no point in continuing to blame her for it. What we want is for young women who come from more privileged circumstances to work in social services for a while and see how hard it is to bring up kids on welfare, and the problems facing the poor. Hopefully they'll take that social awareness into their own life, politics and eventual child-raising.

We're humans - we make mistakes and shit happens. What we need to be doing is finding ways to help the unfortunate out of the holes that they have dug for themselves, or which life has imposed on them. And I don't think we can do that by standing back and being hands off. Britain is becoming far too much a blame culture, and that doesn't solve anything - what we need to have is a culture of helping each other, and I don't think it's unreasonable to say that young people should owe service to society within that framework.

,"&gt;Ad-hominem is an attack on the character of the person which you are arguing with. Please try to at least understand the premises of terms before you use them.

Well you attempted to dismiss all my points by alleging I had no experience with Christians.  Disregarding my arguments by alleging I have no experience with Christians, or in simpler terms you called me ignorant and used that insult of my person to disregard the points I had raised.  
If that's not an ad-hominem then what would you call it?

&gt;I think you need to replace Christian with ""biblical literalist"" in this sentence. The two are not the same.

&gt;The people you're talking about are literalists. They are not Christians.

What's the point of the distinction?  I just told you that in over 30 years of dealing with Christians I have not met one single one (or heard about any on the news) who don't fit that pattern.  If 100%(1) of the Christians I have dealt with in my life are also 'literalists' then what's the point in saying 'literalist is not the same thing' when they apparently go hand in hand?  Why say ""criticise literalist christians only not all christians when thus far literalist Christians are the only type to be found?""  Please explain?

(1) That's 100% initially, not counting the ones who once criticised for their conduct make excuses like ""i'm not a homophobe, I have gay friends"" despite their anti-LGBT comments and conduct.   

&gt;It may be that I don't live in an ass-backwards completely intolerant state and/or city. It sounds like that's the only experience with these people you have. If this is the only impression you've ever gotten, come to Los Angeles and I'll take you to a 99% black church that embrace the LGBT community. These people are Christians.

Well I live in Australia and I follow news from Australia, America and Europe closely, and have travelled to various parts of the US and Europe.  Just to shed some light upon the three continents of exposure to Christians I have thus far.  

I have only been in LA briefly using LAX as a transit hub.  So maybe LA is the exception to the rule?  If so then I should go there and check out some non-hateful and non-literalist Christians there and you should broaden your experiences beyond that one place and thus see where i'm coming from?  ^_^

&gt;It's laughable that you call anything I put fourth into question while your proof of ""experience"" is just as good as mine.

Um, actually I have been carefully weighing each equally and making a point of not discounting your experiences or how they have shaped your opinions, but merely mentioning I have not had those experiences and won't disregard my life experience on your say-so.  You conversely have been quite willing to discount my experiences, declare me wrong, treat your opinions as evidence, and so forth.  

For example:
&gt;I'd say venture out into the world a little, son.

I find it laughable that you think I am the one being rude and dismissive.  

&gt;Full Disclosure : I'm an Atheist born and raised in Los Angeles.

And you're criticising me for not having familiarity with Christianity and not looking outside my own home town / home state?  You're the one saying ""I'd say venture out into the world a little, son."" and other dismissive put-downs?  

I'll check out LA some-year and do so with an open mind.  If you get out of LA sometime please try to have an open mind.  I suggest you start by pulling your head out of your own arse, and listening to other people rather than dismissing out of hand their opinions, ideas, and life experience.  You might learn something.

,"I've spent a lot of time traveling the world for work, managing developing studios of people my age and talent in Asia and Europe, and I actually have an answer to this:

Americans, still to this day, are one of the few people I've known in the world who are still delusional enough to believe that they, a single individual in the face of a massive six-billion strong human organism, can actually change shit.  We are the home of the doacratic personality type.  We lack the rigid social structures and pre-planned social places that have kept other societies and cultures both stable and stagnant.  America is full of cults of personality-  not just our Hollywood celebrity culture either.  Look at the leaders of the Open Source Movement, of many of the world-wide subcultures, of culture and art- they came from America.  We're a people arrogant and self-righteous enough to forgo the 'right' safe way of doing things to run around the country hopping trains, or living in artists communes, or building temporary cities of 50k people.  We are incredibly diverse- One common theme I always heard when I partied with my German friends is that 'America is the Land of Extremes, You are so large, you have so many different people - the coolest people, the lamest people, the scariest people, the meanest people, and the friendliest people- all under one flag.  We're not sure how you all haven't killed each-other yet, we've been expecting you to for decades, but somehow you keep making it work'

I'm proud to be part of this quirky tradition.  I'm proud to be a part of a society that, while on the surface may have far too many rules, it doesn't matter because none of us give a shit about any of them.  The very divisiveness and diversity that we grow tired of here is what keeps us churning- playing off one another, growing, and evolving.

America is a land founded on arrogance.  We are a land that personifies arrogance.  We will do as we will do, and if someone gets in our way, we'll just work around them.  Sure our social system is broken, we're staggering under loads of debt, and by all rational rules and measures things look bad now- I'm not concerned, we'll just change the rules.  Again.

-If your on the east coast, I suggest visiting the New England States including New York, New Hampshire, and Vermont.

,"the guns are balanced incredibly well. all the weapons are extremely deadly but at different ranges with different tactics.

Precision in your shooting and map positioning is mandatory.

It's an extremely fair game, skilled players can typically roam the map more freely and consequently do more objective damage, while less skilled player can still do well if they stick with support. Also the maps are very well designed, the maps normally have one major semi confined path(it may go through buildings over bridges, have houses lining the streets) inbetween spawn with 2 flanking paths. A much clearer feeling of where on the map you should expect to find resistance.(this results in a much higher proportion of head to head conflict than something like CoD)

The engagements between players are extremely short, a good ping time is crucial, those milliseconds really do make a significant difference. 

Best balanced FPS in existence in my opinion and although I wouldn't call it a simulation, call of duty or medal of honour really start to feel like ""cart racer"" shooters in comparison.

very popular in certain european countries because the population density helps keep the pings exceptionally low.(do not play this game over wifi!)

additional: Why I LOVE it. One person who finds a good position can do a world of damage. typically teams will camp their way up and down the map, where you push through a choke point gain superior positioning and hold until the next drive. One person who gains a dangerous position can really get a fair slaughter fest going(I define it as fair because it's always possible through team tactics or exceptional grenade/rifle skill to remove him). It's all about disrupting the balance of troops currently alive on the map near objectives.

China, 1945-49:
Intervened in a civil war, taking the side of Chiang Kai-shek against the Communists, even though the latter had been a much closer ally of the United States in the world war. The U.S. used defeated Japanese soldiers to fight for its side. The Communists forced Chiang to flee to Taiwan in 1949.
Italy, 1947-48:
Using every trick in the book, the U.S. interfered in the elections to prevent the Communist Party from coming to power legally and fairly. This perversion of democracy was done in the name of ""saving democracy"" in Italy. The Communists lost. For the next few decades, the CIA, along with American corporations, continued to intervene in Italian elections, pouring in hundreds of millions of dollars and much psychological warfare to block the specter that was haunting Europe.
Greece, 1947-49:
Intervened in a civil war, taking the side of the neo-fascists against the Greek left which had fought the Nazis courageously. The neo-fascists won and instituted a highly brutal regime, for which the CIA created a new internal security agency, KYP. Before long, KYP was carrying out all the endearing practices of secret police everywhere, including systematic torture.
Philippines, 1945-53:
U.S. military fought against leftist forces (Huks) even while the Huks were still fighting against the Japanese invaders. After the war, the U. S. continued its fight against the Huks, defeating them, and then installing a series of puppets as president, culminating in the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos.

,"Chile, 1964-73:
Salvador Allende was the worst possible scenario for a Washington imperialist. He could imagine only one thing worse than a Marxist in power-an elected Marxist in power, who honored the constitution, and became increasingly popular. This shook the very foundation stones on which the anti-Communist tower was built: the doctrine, painstakingly cultivated for decades, that ""communists"" can take power only through force and deception, that they can retain that power only through terrorizing and brainwashing the population.
After sabotaging Allende's electoral endeavor in 1964, and failing to do so in 1970, despite their best efforts, the CIA and the rest of the American foreign policy machine left no stone unturned in their attempt to destabilize the Allende government over the next three years, paying particular attention to building up military hostility. Finally, in September 1973, the military overthrew the government, Allende dying in the process.
They closed the country to the outside world for a week, while the tanks rolled and the soldiers broke down doors; the stadiums rang with the sounds of execution and the bodies piled up along the streets and floated in the river; the torture centers opened for business; the subversive books were thrown into bonfires; soldiers slit the trouser legs of women, shouting that ""In Chile women wear dresses!""; the poor returned to their natural state; and the men of the world in Washington and in the halls of international finance opened up their check- books. In the end, more than 3,000 had been executed, thousands more tortured or disappeared.
Greece, 1964-74:
The military coup took place in April 1967, just two days before the campaign for j national elections was to begin, elections which appeared certain to bring the veteran liberal leader George Papandreou back as prime minister. Papandreou had been elected in February 1964 with the only outright majority in the history of modern Greek elections. The successful machinations to unseat him had begun immediately, a joint effort of the Royal Court, the Greek military, and the American military and CIA stationed in Greece. The 1967 coup was followed immediately by the traditional martial law, censorship, arrests, beatings, torture, and killings, the victims totaling some 8,000 in the first month. This was accompanied by the equally traditional declaration that this was all being done to save the nation from a ""Communist takeover."" Corrupting and subversive influences in Greek life were to be removed. Among these were miniskirts, long hair, and foreign newspapers; church attendance for the young would be compulsory.
It was torture, however, which most indelibly marked the seven-year Greek nightmare. James Becket, an American attorney sent to Greece by Amnesty International, wrote in December 1969 that ""a conservative estimate would place at not less than two thousand"" the number of people tortured, usually in the most gruesome of ways, often with equipment supplied by the United States.
Becket reported the following: Hundreds of prisoners have listened to the little speech given by Inspector Basil Lambrou, who sits behind his desk which displays the red, white, and blue clasped-hand symbol of American aid. He tries to show the prisoner the absolute futility of resistance: ""You make yourself ridiculous by thinking you can do anything. The world is divided in two. There are the communists on that side and on this side the free world. The Russians and the Americans, no one else. What are we? Americans. Behind me there is the government, behind the government is NATO, behind NATO is the U.S. You can't fight us, we are Americans.""
George Papandreou was not any kind of radical. He was a liberal anti-Communist type. But his son Andreas, the heir-apparent, while only a little to the left of his father had not disguised his wish to take Greece out of the Cold War, and had questioned remaining in NATO, or at least as a satellite of the United States.
East Timor, 1975 to present:
In December 1975, Indonesia invaded East Timor, which lies at the eastern end of the Indonesian archipelago, and which had proclaimed its independence after Portugal had relinquished control of it. The invasion was launched the day after U. S. President Gerald Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had left Indonesia after giving Suharto permission to use American arms, which, under U.S. Iaw, could not be used for aggression. Indonesia was Washington's most valuable tool in Southeast Asia.
Amnesty International estimated that by 1989, Indonesian troops, with the aim of forcibly annexing East Timor, had killed 200,000 people out of a population of between 600,000 and 700,000. The United States consistently supported Indonesia's claim to East Timor (unlike the UN and the EU), and downplayed the slaughter to a remarkable degree, at the same time supplying Indonesia with all the military hardware and training it needed to carry out the job.",1278123405,c0tez4h,False,,xoites,1426365170,0,t5_6,0,True,1,0,t1_c0tez4h,False,t1_c0tevsf,1,t3_clhgq,,reddit.com

,"It appears that you might be thinking on two different historical planes, here. With that being said, I'm going to somewhat defend your comment, because it's not absurd to claim that China has a tendency to conflate science and political doctrine.

Chinese paleontology and paleoanthropology is slightly notorious for promoting the notion that the prehistoric ""Chinese"" peoples evolved separately, thus rejecting the mtDNA ""African Eve"" as part of their evolutionary history. They emphasize Peking Man (Homo erectus) at site Zhoukoudian, and keep pushing for a more ancient dating of the fossils. There is also a curious lack of common Homo tool technology found in Chinese archaeological digs (explainable by reasons such as the presence different tool-making materials like bamboo which biodegrades unlike stone, and a different diet, deriving protein from fish rather than other meats, that necessitated different tools), further encouraging the shaky theory that prehistoric Chinese evolved independently. Some Chinese subscribe to Multiregionalism, or the position that archaic humans (H. erectus, and still a single species arising in Africa) evolved in situ all over Africa, Europe, the Levant, and Asia as a response to various stressors. Yet even this theory requires gene flow, as the end result was a singular Homo sapiens.

,"I'm currently 29. From the age of 17 to 27, I was always in a relationship. It's just what I did. I was always known as *goochtek* and partner. The longest I was single in that time was 5 months and even then I was seeing people but nothing serious. 

Anyway, at age 27, I had quite a bad breakup with the girl I was seeing for around a year. I was devastated so I decided to take some time for myself and, to use an old cliché, I needed to find out who I was. I ended up spending 2 months in Europe (I'm from Australia) and had a blast. I met so many people and had such a great time that when I finally came home I didn't want to be with anyone. I just wanted to do the single thing for a while. I had offers for relationships but I stuck to my guns and kept the promise I made to myself. 

Well, fast forward a year and people started questioning why I have been single for so long. The ""taking time for myself"" line was getting tired. I still wanted to keep it up because I had been bettering myself during this time too. I had paid off all of my debt, got a promotion at work, bought a small house and remedied a lot of my bad habits. I still felt like I wanted to be single and that no one would be able to change my mind. 

Fast forward again to 2 months ago. I signed up for online dating because I just wanted to meet some new people but wasn't really looking for anything serious. I received a few emails from various women but wasn't that keen. I ended up meeting a few of them for dinner/drinks. I clicked with one more than the others but I wasn't really overly interested and turns out she was feeling the same. I ended up going overseas again for a few weeks and when I came back the girl who I'd seen the most of contacted me and wanted to catch up. I accepted and we had dinner. Turns out that we were both in a bit of a slump the month before and this time around we ended up having a great time. We got on like a house on fire. We have now been seeing each other for a few weeks and it's been pretty great. I'm glad I took the step but I can tell you that I definitely needed that time to be single.

Hopefully this helps!

,"You sir, are about to enter my wheelhouse.

In general, the stripper's job is to approach you as an ATM machine, and her goal is to discover your pin number. Once one finds the emotional chink in your armor, not only will she attempt to drain you of all your cash, she will attempt to have you purchase funny money (house dollars) on your credit card. There is nothing funny about funny money. I repeat, do not get the funny money.

Hang out for a while before you commit to any lap dances. This gives you a chance to survey the entire talent pool, a lot of the girls are often hanging out in the back. You don't want to waste your precious $$ on a girl that isn't your type.

Don't waste a girl's time by letting her sit down and talk if she's not your type. Tell her you're ""just hanging out right now"" or ""taking a break"" if she asks if you want a lap dance.

Try to avoid the Eastern European girls. They are money-centric robots, and generally give horrible lap dances.

If she's cute and not hustling you too hard or she's just hanging out, it's ok buy her a drink.
Just don't let her order a bottle of champagne. 

Keep track of how many dances she gives you. Most girls are honest, some are not.
Some girls won't tell you if they have started another dance, and at $20 a pop that can add up fast. If you're not sure, ask.

In many clubs light touching is usually acceptable, she'll let you know when you've crossed the line. Respect the line. 

If you are sitting at the stage, always tip. $2-3 is fine. If you like what you see and want to get a lap dance from her give her $10 and ask her to come and visit when she's done. If there's a bunch of dudes trying get her attention you'll most likely win out.

If you are watching any girl dance on stage from a distance, you should tip her a buck or two. It's a fair trade. You're getting something out of it, so should she.

Break her out of her hustler mode, treat her like a person not an object. You'll get better dances if she can connect with you.

She doesn't need to be told that she's ""hot"" or that she has ""great tits"", she knows this already.

Don't forget to make eye contact with her when she gives you a dance.

If you have any massage skills, offer one up. Strippers are a mess, on many levels.

The VIP/ Champagne room is often a waste of money, but it can depend on the club and the girl.

That should get you started.

Be charming. Have fun ;)

,"To that I would like to reference the following for the sake of historical background:

Quoted from [Hospitals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitals)       
&gt;""The earliest documented institutions aiming to provide cures were Egyptian  temples. In ancient Greece, temples dedicated to the healer-god Asclepius, known as Asclepieia (Greek: Ασκληπιεία, sing. Asclepieion Ασκληπιείον), functioned as centers of medical advice, prognosis, and healing.""
    
&gt;""In the Asclepieion of Epidaurus, three large marble boards dated to 350 BC preserve the names, case histories, complaints, and cures of about 70 patients who came to the temple with a problem and shed it there. Some of the surgical cures listed, such as the opening of an abdominal abscess or the removal of traumatic foreign material, are realistic enough to have taken place, but with the patient in a state of enkoimesis induced with the help of soporific substances such as opium.  The worship of Asclepius was adopted by the Romans. Under his Roman name Æsculapius, he was provided with a temple (291 BC) on an island in the Tiber in Rome, where similar rites were performed.""

Quoted from [Medicine in medievel Islam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine_in_medieval_Islam)     
&gt;""In the medieval Islamic world, hospitals were built in major cities; in Cairo for example, the Qalawun Hospital could care for 8,000 patients with a staff that included physicians, pharmacists, and nurses. One could also access a dispensary, and research facility that led to advances, which included the discovery of the contagious nature of diseases, and research into optics and the mechanisms of the eye. Muslim doctors  were removing cataracts with hollow needles. Hospitals were built not only for the physically sick, but for the mentally sick also. One of the first ever psychiatric hospitals that cared for the mentally ill was built in Cairo. Hospitals later spread to Europe during the Crusades, inspired by the hospitals in the Middle East. The first hospital in Paris, Les Quinze-vingts, was founded by Louis IX after his return from the Crusade between 1254-1260.
                 
&gt;Hospitals in the Islamic world featured competency tests for doctors, drug purity regulations, nurses and interns, and advanced surgical procedures. Hospitals were also created with separate wards for specific illnesses, so that people with contagious diseases could be kept away from other patients.""
          
&gt;""Another unique feature of medieval Muslim hospitals was the role of female staff, who were rarely employed in ancient and medieval healing temples elsewhere in the world. Medieval Muslim hospitals commonly employed female nurses, including nurses from as far as Sudan, a sign of great breakthrough. Muslim hospitals were also the first to employ female physicians, the most famous being two female physicians from the Banu Zuhr family who served the Almohad ruler Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur in the 12th century. Later in the 15th century, female surgeons  were illustrated for the first time in Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu's Cerrahiyyetu'l-Haniyye  (Imperial Surgery).""


Quoted from [Hospitals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitals)
&gt;The adoption of Christianity as the state religion of the Roman Empire drove an expansion of the provision of care. The First Council of Nicaea in 325 A.D. urged the church to provide for the poor, sick, widows, and strangers. It ordered the construction of a hospital in every cathedral town. Among the earliest were those built by the physician Saint Sampson in Constantinople and by Basil, bishop of Caesarea. The latter was attached to a monastery  and provided lodgings for poor and travelers, as well as treating the sick and infirm. There was a separate section for lepers.
              
&gt;Medieval hospitals in Europe followed a similar pattern to the Byzantine. They were religious communities, with care provided by monks and nuns. (An old French term for hospital is hôtel-Dieu, ""hostel of God."") Some were attached to monasteries; others were independent and had their own endowments, usually of property, which provided income for their support. Some hospitals were multi-functional while others were founded for specific purposes such as leper hospitals, or as refuges for the poor, or for pilgrims: not all cared for the sick. The first Spanish hospital, founded by the Catholic Visigoth bishop Masona in 580 at Mérida, was a xenodochium designed as an inn for travellers (mostly pilgrims to the shrine of Eulalia of Mérida) as well as a hospital for citizens and local farmers. The hospital's endowment consisted of farms to feed its patients and guests.
                                                   
                                                      
&gt;The first hospital founded in the Americas was the Hospital San Nicolás de Bari [Calle Hostos] in Santo Domingo, Distrito Nacional Dominican Republic. Fray Nicolas de Ovando, Spanish governor and colonial administrator from 1502–1509, authorized its construction on December 29, 1503. This hospital apparently incorporated a church. The first phase of its construction was completed in 1519, and it was rebuilt in 1552.",1278142641,c0tfgyj,True,,[deleted],1426365401,0,t5_2qh2p,0,True,3,0,t1_c0tfgyj,False,t1_c0tfb61,3,t3_clg0u,,atheism

[Demographics of Atheism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_atheism)           
&gt;Several studies have found Sweden to be one of the most atheist countries in the world. According to Davie (1999), 80% of Swedes do not believe in God. In the Eurostat survey, 23% of Swedish citizens responded that ""they believe there is a God"", whereas 53% answered that ""they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force"" and 23% that ""they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force"". This, according to the survey, would make Swedes the third least religious people in the 27-member European Union, after Estonia and the Czech Republic. In 2001, the Czech Statistical Office provided census information on the ten million people in the Czech Republic. 59% had no religion, 32.2% were religious, and 8.8% did not answer.

&gt;A 2006 survey in the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten (on February 17), saw 1,006 inhabitants of Norway answering the question ""What do you believe in?"". 29% answered ""I believe in a god or deity"", 23% answered ""I believe in a higher power without being certain of what"", 26% answered ""I don't believe in God or higher powers"", and 22% answered ""I am in doubt"".

,"&gt;But not believing in anything means that the only truth are emotions

No it doesn't. I have no problem with you seeing it that way if you want but I do not accept that as some sort of ""universal truth"". Why do you believe it yourself though?

&gt; If people have a way to mature, they will solve conflicts in a more and more compassionate way.

Again, not necessarily. I don't believe there is one true path greater than all others. I also don't believe there is one great destination that all paths lead to.

You are stuck in a mindset I think. You view the world as a battle between compassion and one of indifference or selfishness. You want the power of compassion to destroy the indifference. You believe it is the natural path of humans.

You don't understand what Nietzsche was saying when he said ""God is Dead"". He was arguing that there are no epic battles between Good and Evil. You have merely substituted ""compassion"" where once stood God.

There is no battle there. It is a figment of your imagination fuelled by your emotion.

&gt; So you deny your emotions.

What does that mean? I feel emotions and they help shape my behaviour. Sometimes I let them guide me and sometimes I prevent them from doing so.

&gt; My emotions are the only thing left in a world of nihilism. I don't see much else to liberate me from the deadlock of nihilism.

That is fine, but just remember you are not everyone. This is related to ""choice"" I was saying before. You have made a choice to believe that your emotions are your ultimate guide. The mindset you need to keep is that it isn't the only valid choice and it may not necessarily be the best choice. In fact ""the best choice"" is meaningless in a universe without values.

But I do wonder how people in general will change once confronted with theses issues (which are still very much discussed only by a select few). From the bankers on Wall Street, the politicians at all levels of government, the poor in Africa, the rich in Europe. Once this level of understanding reaches *everyone* I wonder what value systems people will choose.

I hope they choose ones that lead to a better world but I do not see that as a guarantee. In fact unless people like you and I campaign for good value systems I feel the general public will slide towards value systems that have a negative overall impact on behaviour.",1278154501,c0tfmt5,False,,[deleted],1426365478,0,t5_2qh13,0,True,1,0,t1_c0tfmt5,False,t1_c0tejym,1,t3_cku1z,,worldnews

,"illegal migration by colonists from Europe or Egyptian farmers displacing natives is wrong. 
Correct?

I do find your link a bit laughable. They calculate the arab imigration INTO palestine by taking the an estimate of population growth rate and then the actual population 10 years later and calculate that the population over the estimate must be illegal immigration. Seriously.  
Talk about iffy calculations.

*It is not surprising then that the British census data produce an Arab Palestinian population growth for 1922-31 that turns out to be generated by natural increase and legal migrations alone. Applying a 2.5 per annum growth rate[30] to a population stock of 589,177 for 1922 generates a 1931 population estimate of 735,799 or 97.6 percent of the 753,822 recorded in the 1931 census. Does the imputation model then ""prove"" that illegal immigration into Palestine was inconsequential during 1922-31? Not at all. A footnote accompanying the census's population time series acknowledges the presence in Palestine of illegal Arab immigration. But because it could not be recorded, no estimate of its numbers was included in the census count.[31] Ignoring illegal migrants does not mean they don't exist.*

laughable

*Another effort to police dissent is focused on those who teach Middle East studies on college campuses. **Middle East Forum,** a think tank run by Daniel Pipes and **supportive of the Israeli right wing,** has established a Campus Watch website. After failing in his own pursuit of an academic career, Pipes has evidently decided to take revenge on the scholarly community that rejected him*

and 

Martin Kramer also edits Middle East Quarterly, the house organ of the **Middle East Forum,** the neo-conservative think tank directed by Daniel Pipes. Pipes has a long record of attempting to incite Americans against Arabs and Muslims. In 1990 he wrote:

*Western European societies are unprepared for the massive immigration of brown-skinned peoples cooking strange foods and maintaining different standards of hygiene. All immigrants bring exotic customs and attitudes, but Muslim customs are more troublesome than most*

And

Daniel Pipes and Martin Kramer of the **Middle East Forum** now run a website in the United States to denounce academics who are deemed to have shown ""hatred of Israel"". One of the eight professors already on this contemptible McCarthyite list. It is grotesquely called ""Campus Watch"" committed the unpardonable sin of signing a petition in support of the Palestinian scholar Edward Said.

I think the vast number of notebooks has to do with niche consumers in Japan. Again, I could be wrong, but I don't see them pushing the VAIO line very aggressively in the US/EU, but in Japan, they're all over billboards, TV, and even the video ads on the Tokyo subway (and that's gotta be expensive advertising).

Apple has done well with it's two-notebooks-only lineup because they're trying to offer a simple shopping experience without much hassle. Everyone who can afford one will get the same equally nice machine, give or take some RAM and storage capacity. 

Sony is going after the same premium segment, but without the ease-of-purchase. Instead, they offer up every conceivable feature any user *might* want in various models combined with other features/screen sizes/form factors/colors, etc. Something specific for everyone with the money to pay for it. That, and a new one will come out approximately every 90 days without fail. There's no having the *latest* with Sony unless you're rich and bored.

Mobile phones are similar in Japan. Hundreds of models from a handful of manufactures. Most are heavily feature-laden, highly stylized, and made to accommodate the kawaii charms and rhinestones so popular with young girls. However, the UI and software in these phones is usually absolute shit, especially if you don't think like a software engineer. That is, lots of focus on cool features and functions, with very little thought put into the user experience at all.

Again, contrast that with Apple. The iPhone didn't have every feature customers might ask for, but it made using a smartphone fun and simple. There was only one model, so there wasn't any anxiety about buying one, and the UI was easy enough for grandmas while still enough to please the geeks. After a few years on the market, the iPhone is making big in-roads in Japan (a land of *soft* nationalism when it comes to consumers, and *hard* nationalism as pertains to industrial policy, esp. manufacturing and technology) and is one of the few American-branded items to really gain traction in the electronics realm, and probably THE ONLY foreign mobile to make a dent in the monopoly of domestic phones.

Again, Sony is losing on both fronts. I'm not forsaking my PS3 or my collection of 90s-vintage Sony electronics, but I don't buy much from them anymore. The competition has gotten too good to be so loyal. Sharp, Onkyo, Samsung, Apple, et al. have worked hard to catch up to that mythical Sony lead in R&amp;D and quality, and now have probably overtaken.

,"Er, as a student of legal history I can safely say that at the very least under common law women were actually considered chattels, not merely like chattels. This is why, for example, under Hale until R and R [1991] spousal status was an affirmative defence to rape in England and Wales, and similar defences existed until the latter half of the 20th Century in Canada, the United States, and other common law countries. Women certainly had some rights, but they were very limited compared to their fathers and husbands who largely exercised dominion in law if not necessarily in practice.

If you go back to Roman law, legally women weren't considered full adults and retained a sort of legal guardian who had to approve all property, business, and legal decisions by the women; the same thing applied to males, but only before they came of age. Of course Rome was actually fairly good to women in practice because the guardians weren't required to be authoritarian with their rule, but the level of liberality waxed and waned throughout the Republic and Empire, largely based on the prevalent social mood of the day. Being free as a woman in any meaningful modern sense certainly wasn't guaranteed, and even at times when the regime was generally liberal that didn't stop individual guardians being strict or miserly. Keep in mind, before dismissing this as being from far antiquity and thus irrelevant, that Roman law formed the basis of the legal systems of most of continental Europe and thus their colonial assets, and while specific points of law were often altered the general tone remained the same, including on women's rights.

,"&gt; You say US is richest per capita effectively?

No other nation in the world has the raw surplus funding available above the minimum overhead of infrastructure costs as does the US.  We have 25% of the global GDP and 4.4% of the global population.

That gives us a **massive** ability to incarcerate the non-productive without adversely impacting the economic wherewithal of the remainder of the population.

Same thing goes with how we can sustain the military we do.

&gt; EU has more money (total) than the US, and much lower employment percentage overall,

Only because their wage constraints force out the lower end of the workforce. They also have a substantially larger population than the US.  Nearly 3x the population.  And yet their GDP is largely equivalent to the US's.  (16 Trillion).  

So they have vastly less ""surplus capital"" than does the US.

&gt; implying that it'd certainly have the ability to jail a huge number of people. We just rather give them welfare and stuff, because freedom is a big value over here, and taking it away isn't done lightly.

You define freedom rather strangely given the raw ignorance the vast majority of the EU seems to have to the foundational principles of liberty.  As evinced in no other means so greatly as by the German ban on Holocaust Denial and Nazi paraphernalia.  (And please, don't toss that tired fucking canard about the will of the people and the right to not be offended et al.  Neither override the foundational principles of what is required to claim liberty and liberalism on a societal level.)

The EU has no problems taking away the freedoms of entire populations.  It does, however, stop at denuding those freedoms it *has* recognized as being legitimate.  But those freedoms do not map to actual freedom as defined in the liberal tradition.

Also -- putting people on welfare costs **far** less than does incarcerating them.  And furthermore -- merely because a person is not incarcerated does not (as I referenced above) indicate that they are free from interference by government.

,"&gt; Pathetic article from another pathetic BBC pundit. All of them have been shocking from Shearer, Lawrenson, Hansen to Dixon. The problem is not with the players moving abroad and learning to become more technical. Of course this would have been the case when Waddle was playing. The Premier League didn't exist then and the money wasn't there to attract big name players and managers.

So why are our ""star players"" faring so badly against players that would struggle in the Championship? As this article states there are no other alternatives and as Roy Keane has stated the reason we look up to these players is because they're English, not because they're the best players in their team.

&gt; Take Arsenal for example. One of the best possession sides in Europe. Ok, admittedly they were given a spanking by Barcelona in the Champions League, but we're still talking about the Champions League. Look at Chelsea, beaten by the eventual winners, and by a manager who knows them inside out. Take Man Utd, regardless of them being beaten by Bayern Munich, they were destroying them in the first half of the second leg until they went a player down.

The whole ""Arsenal are technically proficient"" thing is hyperbole. They are technical for the Premier League and that's how they survive without huge financial backing. Compare them to a number of teams in Europe and they're hardly playing the most beautiful game on the planet.

Besides, Arsenal are hardly known for their amazing English talent. Walcott couldn't finish a Happy Meal and Wilshere is still finding his place.

&gt; The premier league has some of the most advanced technical sides in the world, this is not hyperbole. Going back to Arsenal, we can see the problem for England is not that their players are not going to foreign teams, they're barely getting into their own teams.

Exactly. 

It's the typical English mentality all over again. There are loads of teams that would love to have players like Wellbeck and Wilshere, but they're more than likely content to sit on the bench. Ben Foster is a prime example of a great player wasting away on a Premier League bench and I'd be shocked if he found the potential many claimed he had before.

Anyway, when you say we have some of the most advanced technical sides in the world, who are you referring to? Outside of the top four the majority of those teams aren't any better than those in Europe. Would you really rate the likes of Juventus, Lazio, Fiorentina, 	Villarreal, Athletico Madrid, Benfica, Porto and Lyon above the mid-table Premier League teams?

It's pure ignorance to say that our players wouldn't improve if they were to look for football outside of this country. You've stated nothing but money when it comes to the Premier League and you've even stated that no young talent can progress in this league, so why are they staying?

The Premier League is one league with an entirely different feel to that of the other large world leagues.

*Perhaps the greatest book by one of our greatest historians, The Discoverers is a volume of sweeping range and majestic interpretation. To call it a history of science is an understatement; this is the story of how humankind has come to know the world, however incompletely (""the eternal mystery of the world,"" Einstein once said, ""is its comprehensibility""). Daniel J. Boorstin first describes the liberating concept of time--""the first grand discovery""--and continues through the age of exploration and the advent of the natural and social sciences. The approach is idiosyncratic, with Boorstin lingering over particular figures and accomplishments rather than rushing on to the next set of names and dates. It's also primarily Western, although Boorstin does ask (and answer) several interesting questions: Why didn't the Chinese ""discover"" Europe and America? Why didn't the Arabs circumnavigate the planet? His thesis about discovery ultimately turns on what he calls ""illusions of knowledge.""

&gt;There is one small problem with his account of the story however. Auschwitz was liberated by the Soviets, not the Americans. OUCH! His campaign’s response was to say that he, and here is that word again, “misspoke”. Obama apparently meant that his uncle helped to liberate a different camp.

&gt; That is where one other little problem comes to light. Barack Obama’s mother was an only child, so Obama didn’t even have any American uncles. His campaign has had to further clarify what Barack Obama meant to say. According to the latest release by his campaign, Obama meant to say his great uncle liberated some other concentration camp not in Auschwitz.

 &gt;I find it hard to believe that Obama just slipped up during his comments. He had no clue who liberated Auschwitz, but he did know that he didn’t have an American uncle. He told the story anyway. This is purely a case of a politician saying whatever he thinks he should to get elected.

[... and lied  again](http://www.audacityofhypocrisy.com/2008/05/27/obama-lied-the-second-time-about-his-uncle/)

&gt;From Obama’s 2002 speech:

&gt;“My grandfather signed up for a war the day after Pearl Harbor was bombed, fought in Patton’s army. He saw the dead and dying across the fields of Europe; he heard the stories of fellow troops who first entered Auschwitz and Treblinka. He fought in the name of a larger freedom, part of that arsenal of democracy that triumphed over evil, and he did not fight in vain.”

*ANYWAYS*


Overall, I probably slept in the airports for a total of 8 nights this time  (I splurged more than I normally do when I travel).  Here are some things I have noticed:

* It is nearly impossible to find power outlets after security but they are everywhere out front.

* Closed restaurants and cafes are the best place to sleep.  There are usually soft benches and an occasional power plug or free internet.

* The next best places to sleep are the conveyor belts at the check in desk or on the rugs for the car rental companies

* If you can find a way to make something more comfortable, by moving a few sets of benches or whatever, do it.  The workers almost never mind (except in Sweden, the only place I have had any trouble)

* If you cant find a good place to sleep or carpet (the tiled floors suck all the heat from your body) make a 'nest' from your luggage.

* Dublin and Edinburgh airports are the nicest airports to sleep in!

,"&gt; Earning potential does not necessarily represent skills.

It represents a mixture of skills, the verifiability of your skills and the market demand for your skills. I'm sorry but I don't feel too much pity if you're shocked that your fantastic, but completely unverifiable, skills in cuniform writing do not make you a millionaire.

&gt; Capital is invested where profit can be extracted so the supply and demand curve will always put workers at a disadvantage.

I think you underestimate the skill required to actually invest money where profit can be made. For example European Union Venture Capital is in bit of a crisis because its average returns for the past decade are actually *negative* (and this was even before the credit crisis).

Interesting situation where capital is basically being punished for trying to find profit. This of course is horrible news for European innovation, because it means none really wants to put their money in EU VC funds, which means that if you have some brilliant idea, you're better off pitching it in Boston or San Fran.

I heartily agree that capital accumulates too easily. However, when capital DOESN'T accumulate (like, for example, in European VC), the consequences for the real economy can be devastating. It's really depressing but I don't think we should kill finance before we figure out how we find the good ideas that are already so damn hard to find with the insane incentives available...

&gt; do you really understand fractional reserve banking?

Well enough that I still prefer to call it (bank) leverage, which is what it's typically (and more generically) called in the banking world. Leverage creates more money. Kind of having a cake and eating it, rather like taking a loan on your home (where you have $1,000,000 of money AND $1,000,000 of house, while being worth $1,000,000!) Of course the leverages got rather insane and went up to 35:1 and supposedly in short spats to closer to 60:1, which obviously wasn't sustainable. Still, criticizing high leverage is different to criticizing fractional reserve banking (or leveraged banks) as a concept.

&gt; The things our banking system does can be done much more efficiently.

Parts of it certainly. Actually very large parts of it. However, the financial sector at large is pretty good. I'm thinking futures markets, insurance, reinsurance, equity markets... these are all quite huge things. The problem is that finance keeps hiring incredibly brilliant people to jobs that **really should be made utilities**. For example Initial Public Offerings would be very nice to optimize, as they're very much just old boys clubs these days.

&gt; If your assertion were correct one would expect a high degree of economic mobility and that just isn't the case.

Yes, but I suspect a bigger problem is that especially lower class parents are very bad at instilling the sense of opportunity and believe in self in their children. I suspect that this snuffs as many brilliant careers as financial hardship do (of course, that just means its another problem that should be dealt with, not that both should be ignored).

&gt; If I succeed that bank made much more then the million dollars they loaned me. They get the money they created through fractional reserve banking. They get the interest I paid. They get the principle back. They get all of this because some loan officer filled out the necessary paperwork.

Except of course unless the market crashes and you go bankrupt and my house is now worth $500k. They're $500k short. Or, if you buy a fair amount of stuff and inflation strikes making the loan almost free for you. Especially as they are HELPING the inflation risk that might become truly problematic for them.

&gt; Also keep in mind, we are in supply and demand territory again. Capital is more rare then business ideas.

As someone who has raised Venture Capital, I can tell you that I very, very much know. They can afford to be complete dicks about it. On the other hand, having dealt with a lot of startups (and knowing the stats), it's DIFFICULT to make money doing those investments. 

&gt; Also, if risk were such a big deal why not distribute it and share it with workers if it is such an onerous thing? It is telling that it isn't shared.

It is. At least in my company it was. Every employee has equity and is taking below market salaries, essentially investing work every month (as they do not have capital) for equity. I think it works well, and quite frankly it's expected these days.

I think a lot of people DO do the sharing, just look at startups.

Of course, huge companies are different beasts entirely, but they are the easy way out for employees and they know this - complaining about not participating in the capital returns of Wal-Mart strikes me as quite inane. If you want to participate in the capital returns, go somewhere where you can invest (risk something), which means a startup.",1278173636,c0tg01i,False,,Delheru,1426365647,0,t5_2qh13,0,True,1,0,t1_c0tg01i,False,t1_c0tft5l,1,t3_clk3x,,worldnews

There's an interesting talk by Neil deGrasse Tyson that covers how ID existed long ago. Even Newton was tempted to credit a creator when he was stumped. If anything, the scientists of old were inclined toward religion. It took a long time to shake the habit.

You could also counter by mentioning how it was in fact religion that had the upper hand and was quite overtly trying to censor science. They have been losing the fight for a long time.

Right now the unemployment rate here is substantially lower than in the US. (actually the US also uses a more optimistic metric so it always looks like there is fuller employment in the US).  So if you speak the language and have a complete education it far easier to get a job.  In Europe the labor laws are more fair (instead of tilted towards employers like it is in Georgia) so jobs are more stable and reliable.

,"Darwin was talking about what happens over thousands of years, not what happens between today and tomorrow. The situation in Chad is actually following Darwin's theory exactly- the ""fit"", those who can survive on little food and in the intense sunlight survive. Those who can't survive on little food and in the intense sunlight die. Because the people who can't survive on little food die, over time, the average amount of food each person needs very slowly moves down. That's what evolution is. Which has nothing to do with what you're talking about.

The situation in Chad has more to do with politics than with science. Despite the fact that it was all the rage in the late 19th century, ""Social Darwinism"", the idea that Darwinism also applies to social constructs, is total BS. The people of Chad have the *potential* to be doctors and lawyers and earn lots of money just like the rest of us. What they lack is the opportunity. The spread of wealth depends on the trade of goods and the spread of technology depends on the trade of ideas. And while Europe and the Middle East were trading, the only thing they used Africa for was a source of resources. Unlike the U.S., which successfully rebelled in the late 18th century, Africa remained under European control until the early 20th century. So they completely missed out on the industrial revolution. Because they don't have any industry, no one wants to trade with them. Because they don't have a lot of trade, they're dirt poor.

,"If you live in the US (or Canada or western europe) then you have a hell of a lot more wealth than most people even if you're a millionaire.

Yes people are to blame for simply wanting cheap clothing. That is why most things aren't made in America now. That is why people eat shit food in a lot of instances. It's just food which you don't get to keep so they're tight asses about it.

It doesn't just hurt them. It hurts us too. There are much fewer jobs to pick from because everything is made elsewhere and all the shops are dying off leaving you with wal-mart.

If we pay more for clothes then we might get our jobs back which means we could get paid more. Buying $2 shirts isn't going to make them better off or allow them to save enough to become rich. It will just remove your employment options and put you at the mercy of the rich even more so. I just can't believe so many people are blind to this fact.

A lot of my t-shirts were like $20+. I still have all virtually all of them going back to high school so we're talk about 15 years old. Luckily I didn't wear tight fitting clothes so even with any growth since 14/15 I can still wear a lot of them.

As long as you don't buy over priced fashion clothes (which imo are poorly made in a lot of instances) you should make out well. I would say I probably spend less on clothes than a lot of my friends despite paying more.

Shoes are my weak point though. I walk so much I struggle to get a pair that lasts over 6 months and I'm sort of limited because I need something that I can walk a lot in. The thing is no matter how much they cost they all seem to be made in freaking Vietnam. I'd like to try a pair of shoes made in a western nation if anyone can actually recommend a pair. Seems almost impossible to find a pair that isn't made in Vietnam.

I have nothing against Vietnam but I can't imagine any of the companies pay their employees well even if I pay more. If they can prove to me that they do then I'll support that company over the ones that don't.

,"It's nice that the Dalai Lama has a nice little soundbite that you can trot out to prove that he is not bigoted, but his words in so many other venues inflame so much racist sentiment that that little politically correct speech is useless. His incredible hyperbole, such as using the word ""genocide"" to describe Tibet, lies about the demographics of Tibet, and fantastic tales of abuses make him an international shock jock.

The Dalai Lama switched his longtime position of complete independence to nominal Chinese sovereignty with all the functions of independence (including army, political system, economic system, etc) in the hands of his theocracy. So what? He is increasingly irrelevant in the 'movement', if you can even call it that. The rich Europeans that are bankrolling his campaign call for complete independence, because they know that agitates China, and the only reason that foreigners even care about Tibet is because they want it as a thorn in the side of China.

In places like Sudan, you can actually see footage of alleged cultural repression, and slaughter, forced migrations, etc. With Tibet, you get your information from garbage pseudo-news sources like savetibet.org, run by rich white liberals on the other side of the earth, who have a childlike view of Tibetans. That they should be an uncontacted people, without any modern amenities like running water and electricity. That they should be ruled by a repressive religious cadre, like much of the world in the 800s.

,"Don't forget the influx of illegal aliens from Central America and South America that occurred during that time period.

They are significantly different from the Europeans who arrived at the beginning of the 20th century, and the Asians who arrived 50 years earlier to work on the railways. Back then, there were no social programs available to be exploited. It was necessary to work just merely to survive. So those immigrants came and they worked hard, they contributed to society, and made America what it is.

The later migrants, however, were able to take advantage of the many social programs put in place after the Great Depression. They had no incentive to work. They had no incentive even to fit in with American society. They formed enclaves, and turned large portions of many Californian cities into gang-run hellholes. They had kids, who grew up in poverty, and thus turned to crime early on.

The social burden of these illegal aliens is huge. It has caused extreme pain for the Californian economy. It's not a problem unique to California or to migrants from South or Central America. It'll be a disaster any time you have a large portion of the population living off of the hard work of the rest of the population, especially when the leeches don't contribute positively in any way.

,"Wouldn't a mining operation be a lot easier on a planet that has a habitable atmosphere?  I mean, I can imagine a very advanced society throwing *entire* asteroids into a smelt at once, to refine the metal content, but for a medium-advanced alien race, it might be difficult to land on an asteroid and mine it.


Especially in the case of slave labor (it stands to reason that in this hypothetical situation, **humans would make *perfect* slave labor**) you want a planet with an atmosphere, and also, where you could grow food to continually support the mission.  Also it might be difficult to take off and land on an asteroid.  Planet Earth really makes a lot of sense if you are going to be basing a semi-permanant mining/spaceport operation.

Also, there's a lot of stuff in the bible about God himself being very, very, very interested in acquiring gold and silver.  It all kind of fits.

&gt;Haggai 2:8 'The silver is Mine and the gold is Mine,' declares the LORD of hosts.

Interestingly enough, many south american cultures have this view of gold as well.  They valued it because, and I quote, it ""Belongs to the Gods"" and not because it was valuable.  This stunned the Europeans when they first arrived.  If an alien race really did land here eons ago and forced early humanity to mine rare earths for them, this kind of belief spread across many different cultures is the sort of mythos you'd expect to see.

,"Oh, well that is not really an issue for me here in Norway. People, were I grew up at least, only attends church on specific occasions (baptism, funerals, weddinds, confirmation, etc) and primarily for cultural reasons; and not religious ones. Pretty much everyone I know, even relatively christian people, are agnostic by most definitions of the term. 
           
Religion is something that is for the most part regarded as a private matter and not used as a basis for evaluating your value as a person. Here is a quote from a post I made earlier about this topic:
&gt;Note in the context of Norwegian society, or so I feel, agnosticism means indifference to the church first and foremost. While some leave the church (requiring paperwork and effort), many just don't attend, might vaguely define themselves as Christians, but would never let a priest tell them what to do. Some teens also chose to have some sort of confirmation party/ceremony that is entirely separate from the church. Taking the tradition entirely out of the realm of the religious. 
             
A few daysthere was a small notice in the local newspaper with a picture of about, I guess ten kids or so, having undergone [humanitarian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian) confirmation (lutheran confirmation is a part of norwegian culture - I was asked to be confirmed to please my rather christian grandmother, but it was never an ultimatium or a must). Though this was mostly to congratulate and welcome them into entry stage of ""adulthood"" little else. Also noting in the article how the focus of confirmation was through the growth of humanitarian confirmation, and decline in religious confirmation, becoming a non-religious tradition. 
               
In short, I have never felt that agnostics or atheist are somehow considered to have a lower value in society. In fact, it might actually be the other way, someone who public proclaim their christianity (at least in the context of elementary or high school) are far more likely to be ridiculed than someone who proclaim their agnoticism. Though either way someone who publicly prolaims their faith are likely to be considered a weirdo. 
    
Religious conviction is just not something that is an important part in how people are evaluated here.

,"The rules of being a Scot, laid down long before you or I were born, include being born in Scotland. Faroe Islanders, however much the resemble Scots in their mannerisms, their beliefs, are not Scots.

You don't get to decide the definition of Jew. That was settled millenia before you or I were born. 

You could argue that a portion of the Talmud, most specifically the Pirkei Avot, can be understood without the existence of a deity, but the rest pretty much falls apart, being either _in essence_ based on the whole God story, or, is filled with halacha thereon.

What else do you have? Most of the cultural traditions American Jews know of are really 14th century E. European stuff and have little to nothing to do with the practice at the time of King David. 

Not to mention that Moses, it seems, never existed (there are Egyptian records of the period, but no mention of any slave ""Exodus"" or any plague of plagues).

So, I ask you, what could you _possibly_ mean by saying you, who do not believe in God, are ""Jewish.""

Reminds me of this other guy I was talking to, who was _sure_ you could be a Christian without believing that Jesus was divine. Sure, there have been lots of sects which have varying views on the precise nature of his divinity, but, geesh, he never came back with the name of a sect which didn't actually believe that. Not believing the in Resurrection also prevents you, in all pragmatic circles, from calling yourself a Christian. There was a sect, back in the day, something like the Ebionites, but not one writing of theirs survives, and, in fact, they only have survived into the written record because a bunch of early Church Fathers wrote down ""Those Ebionites are really wack, don't listen to their jive talk.""",1278192575,c0tgkyk,False,,JoshSN,1426365918,0,t5_2qh61,0,True,5,0,t1_c0tgkyk,False,t1_c0tgk69,5,t3_clo8a,,WTF

Last time a non European team beat a European team in the knock out stage, it was the 2002 final.

,"Repost from another thread:  
  
  
When I was a kid, I used to go to summer camps (boy scout style, only atheist/apolitical). The camp was in a densely wooded area in the middle of nowhere (in European terms, so the closest town etc. was just some 20 km away but the only way to get there was on foot on a field trip), it had no electricity, no brick-walled buildings (we slept in tents and when we needed to build a tool shed or something, we had to make it out of logs), we had to draw water from a well and haul it to the field kitchen in 50-litre barrels on a wheelbarrow, when we needed wood for cooking, we had to go to the forest and fell a tree, we bathed every day in a creek and once a week we heated up water to wash our landry (by hand) and ourselves, we took turns keeping night watch and kitchen service. We routinely used knives, axes and saws and of course, minor injuries were pretty commonplace - the medical care we had was an old hospital nurse and an army medic.

There were some 70 kids of both sexes aged 5 - 15 and bullying of the youngest was widespread. Not the downright evil kind though - more like the bullying in the military when you're bullied until you prove your worth and then are taken for equal no matter how weak, small, young or different you are. I was 7 when I was there for the first time and the first week I was thrown in the nettles or being drowned in a creek countless times.

It was staffed by some 15 people of both sexes (mostly college kids, plus some people in their thirties) who took part in all the activities, games etc. with us. It was headed by a male (OMG), who was a an army NCO of some sort by occupation.

The whole thing took 24 days and I went 7 times (I think). First week or so I despised it, then I thought it was OK, then I loved it.

The reason I'm writing all this is that when I was telling this to an American acquaintance of mine, he was absolutely horrified and couldn't believe this kind of stuff is even legal. As I've said, I'm in Europe, so sorry if I'm asking something that's obvious to you. But do summer camps like this ever take place in America?

,"Excellent point.  There are quotes floating around about assassination threats regarding Lincoln, while he was still alive, and related to the currency, not to slavery.  The European moneylenders were offering Lincoln war loans at 26-34% interest.  That's when he said ""Screw it"" and issued the infamous greenback.  He did this debt free, simply conjuring it straight from the treasury, not borrowing it.

,"actually *there are few* people who start out poor and then become rich in the usa. the american dream is a concocted fantasy that drives unquestionable consumption and a relentless work-to-your-death attitude. social mobility is significantly lower in the usa than it is in nearly all of western europe.

in fact, children in the usa have a *higher chance at being poorer than their parents* than they do at being richer. 

&gt;**Children from low-income families have only a 1 percent chance of reaching the top 5 percent of the income distribution**, versus children of the rich who have about a 22 percent chance.

&gt;Children born to the middle quintile of parental family income ($42,000 to $54,300) had about the same chance of ending up in a lower quintile than their parents (39.5 percent) as they did of moving to a higher quintile (36.5 percent). Their chances of attaining the top five percentiles of the income distribution were just 1.8 percent.

&gt;By international standards, **the United States has an unusually low level of intergenerational mobility**: our parents’ income is highly predictive of our incomes as adults. **Intergenerational mobility in the United States is lower than in France, Germany, Sweden, Canada, Finland, Norway and Denmark**. Among high-income countries for which comparable estimates are available, only the United Kingdom had a lower rate of mobility than the United States.

,"The most efficient way of killing off all humanity would of course be some sort of virus.  I suggest smallpox.  While not 100% fatal, it will shake things up enough, especially if you have a good strong strain.  Now acquiring it is a bit of a problem as in the US at least it is tightly controlled.  In fact the exact methods for controlling the last remaining reserve are secret.  However, the Soviet Union was purported to hold its own vast surplus.  You could attempt to get some in eastern European black markets. 
 

   Now, assuming you can get some, you'll want to maximize the death toll till proper medicines can be developed.  You'll want to expose it to antiviral medications, thus producing a strain resistant to current medicines.  From here, strategically place them in airports of large cities.  As well, put them in the mass transit systems of these same cities.  This ensures infection of upper class and lower class individuals as well as transportation to 
peripheral cities.


   As chaos ensues, millions will die.  Assuming you're not caught and you vaccinated yourself beforehand, you must further the death toll.  By this time communications will be breaking down, and reliable information harder to come by.  Start spreading rumors that certain areas have water that give protection, or that blacks and Jews are resistant.  This will cause wild battles for limited sources of ""protection"".  Better yet, tell people wireless signals and power lines make you more vulnerable, thus getting people to sabotage their 
own communication.  


   This will get society to a pre-industrial level, but not wipe it out.  Phase three is where it all comes down.  By this time, the only thing holding society together will be basic structure and cheap food.  Get rid of the food.  Alongside the resistant smallpox you need to grow a resistant form of blight to cast onto major grains: rice, wheat, corn, etc.  With the majority of society broken up and out of communication, it will be difficult to mount a counter to this last threat.  Modern society collapses.


   Now I know what you're saying, there's a chance there could be some hold outs, especially on the outskirts of society.  What then?

,"&gt; We live on planet that is 2/3 water. Sunlight provides adequate energy to desalinate it. If we run out of water, we're doing something very wrong.

The problem with desalinization is that it's costly, and that might be a barrier for third world countries.

Water gets continuously recycled on Earth, but the cycle takes a long time. Added to this, a lot of our fresh water (especially in the western world) comes from the slow melting of glaciers. There are indications that the glaciers will eventually melt away, but I'm not sure how important the glaciers are relative to snow melt.

We are also contaminating most of the water basins of the world with heavy metals and other pollutants.

Agriculture also diminishes water supplies, because it speeds up the rate of evaporation by spreading the water over a large surface area. Which then falls as rain sometimes (but in arid regions, it just wafts away), but that doesn't help the folks who were downstream and would normally have a river full of water.

The problem, really, is that we are changing the distribution, not the quantity, of available fresh water. Combined with the location of most existing societies (placed along historical water ways), changing the distribution of water means that many communities that had water will now find themselves dry, whereas others might find themselves flooded. Either way, it's bad.

Desalinization might be the answer... but again, it's going to be costly. So is transportation. We're lucky enough in the Western and European countries to have infrastructures vast enough to get us water almost no matter what. You have to wonder about places like Somalia and Kenya, though.

,"While I was wrong about Nuremberg (it still comprised only a comparatively minor part of the whole trial), my point about the post war period still stands. There was not serious examination and interviewing of victims until many decades after the holocaust had ended (this being changed largely as a result of the 1961 Eichmann trial), this is not something that is doubted by historians or people engaged in the field of Holocaust Studies. Furthermore, while people originally thought this silence was a result of victims not wishing to share their past, historians like Konrad Kwiet have increasingly argued in recent times that this was more a response by the victims to a desire by Europe and America to forget or ignore the crimes perpetrated. 

Remember also, it was hardly advantageous emphasise or dwell heavily on the holocaust in the post war period, considering the tremendous failure of the Allies to offer shelter or protection to Jews in the build up to the war. Furthermore, the US' delay in entering the war is not cast in a good light in the face of mass genocide.



Edit- also 


&gt;The Holocaust was used as propaganda even before the war ended and the full extent was known.

""in early 1943, a Gallup poll asked Americans: ""It is said that two million Jews have been killed in Europe since the war began. Do you think this is true or just a rumor?"" Although the Allied leadership had publicly confirmed that two million Jews had been murdered, the poll found that only 47% believed it was true, while 29% dismissed it as a rumor; the remaining 24% had no opinion.... A major part of the reason for the public's skepticism was the failure of the American media to treat the Nazi genocide as a serious issue.""

,"Yes, obviously our genes determine every aspect of our physiology. 

Yet these differences are only superficial. For example, I am ""white"" (at least I look white, more on that in a minute), yet if you compare my genetic code of that to a random ""black"" person, there is a greater chance that I would share more of my genetic code with that person than another random ""black"" person would.

Then you have things like what race you are can vary from country to country. A person might be considered ""black"" in one country and ""white"" in another.
Also there are many people from India who are darker skinned than people from Africa, and vice versa.

Two more examples are me and my nephew. For me, 4 of my 8 great grandparents were native Americans. Which would make all of my grandparents ""half breeds"" and since all 4 of them were ""half breeds"" that would make my parents ""half breeds"" as well. And by the same logic, me. Yet, except for a relative lack of body hair, I look ""white"", as do my brothers and sisters. I have blond hair and blue eyes. And what about my ancestors? How many people of other 'races' might they have procreated with? My mom's family originally came from Scotland, and my dads family came from Ireland (in the 1700's). There is another interesting thing to consider when talking about race. Irish people in this country were not considered ""White"" at first, it was only very [recently](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Irish_racism#19th_century) that Irish people started being considered to be white. There was a LOT of racism against Irish people from ""white"" people. Including ironically for me [Scottish](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/2014961.stm) people.

My nephew, Is half ""black"" and half ""White"" (if that is what you could really call my sister). His hair slightly coarser than mine, (my hair is very fine). His hair is curly, but the curls are very loose. His skin tone is about halfway between my sister and his dad. He also has bright blue eyes. He is a beautiful child. What 'race' is he?

What if he marries and has a child with a half 'Asian' half 'Indian' woman? What 'race' would their child be?

&gt;That's quite impressive, if you think about it, and hard to explain if you believe it's based on a notion that's purely socially constructed.

While it may be a pretty good test generally but it is by no means foolproof. I had a friend who you would swear is a Native American yet he is half Korean and half ""White"".

At any rate, we are all a lot more similar than we are different. And the simple fact is that the word “race” has no biological definition, and it does not appear that one could ever be formed, at least not on the basis of genetics.

When Tiger Woods first came onto the scene im willing to bet there was a hell of a lot of racist remarks by those who follow golf.

In the worst countries for racism in Europe (ie. Ex Russian block) the percentage of black players/population is tiny, some clubs even promoting a system of not signing a player unless they are white.

The UK has gradualy gone from pretty much whites only with regards to sports to it not being that big a deal at all what colour a player is in the last few decades.

For example Rangers FC (the team i support) had their first black player who actualy played in 1988 (Before hand a black player was signed during WW1 but he died in the war before he could play).

Mark Walters on his debut was subjected to tides of racial abuse from both Rangers fans who shouted abuse at him when he came on and Celtic fans who shouted at him throughout the match and threw bannanas at him with some even dressed in monkey costumes.

The Rangers board took action and banned some of their own fans who had season tickets (and could be identified from footage of the match).

Since then both Rangers and Celtic have signed numerous black players as well as the rest of the Scottish teams with little to no actual intentional racism.

I assume English clubs have been much the same though i cant say i know first hand anything about the introduction of Black players into the English game.

The abuse players get in Eastern europe nowdays is because the crowds there simply are not used to black players and its the most obvious way to verbaly attack someone by mentioning their obvious defining features.

,"&gt; If my parents physically abuse me, should I still honor and obey them if doing so could bring about my demise?

You have to take the entire passage into context. In Paul's letter to the Ephesians, he clearly creates a contract. Children should honor and love their powers, **however** he goes on to say that parents should also love and treat their children well. This covenant between child and parent is obviously broken when the parents are abusive. This is constantly taken out of context by awful parents who simply abuse their children. However this abuse can be a stranglehold over your life and haunt you, so you must also forgive the parents who have treated you so horribly. Even secular counselors will say this. It sets you free from them.

&gt; Who decides which passages in the book are ignored and which are followed; man, no?

Pretty much. This is the touchiest of touchy subjects. There is a ton of archeological evidence that shows that most of the canonical Bible we have today are made up of a core group of documents that were shared and faithfully recopied by all churches throughout southern Europe and the Middle East, but there were a few that the early church fathers really struggled with making it in there. If you don't believe that at least most of what we have in our current Bible was God's Word, then you don't have much absolute basis in debating if anything is valid in Christianity or not.

&gt; Why is it that a book written hundreds of years ago holds more sway over your decisions than basing it on the science and knowledge gleaned by humanity in the centuries since?

Only the most hostile, secular professor would completely shoot down the Bible on all counts. That book you're referring to has become the cornerstone of Western civilization for 1,500 years. It literally permeates everything. Every single major political system you can conceive of draws at least some inspiration from the Bible. The idea that you have natural, inalienable rights that no one can take away, which is completely unjustified in nature and therefore science, is something that has been passed down to you by Christianity. Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, Caesar Augustus, Marcus Aurelius... Every single brilliant, highly moral classical philosopher you can think of completely disagreed with this proposition. You show compassion to your family and friends, because that is what you find in nature, but there is absolutely no reason you shouldn't invade another country, kill everyone, rape its women and enslave the entire population. Wolves don't help wolves from other packs. The notion that all human beings have worth and should be treated with dignity is derived from Christianity. It is the belief that Jesus died for the sins of all, that everyone is called to have a personal relationship with God and that God loves everyone, and so should you. This concept simply did not exist, and as hard as Chris Hitchens tries to prove it did, it is just utterly false.

Have you ever visited the Colosseum in Rome? It's still huge now, but for its time it was **enormous**. It lays in ruins now, but did you know that originally it was gilded in gold? Gold taken from the Temple of Jerusalem when the Romans razed and sacked it? The Colosseum was where the public went to watch human beings fight to the death or be consumed by lions for public entertainment. **Public entertainment**. And this wasn't just some deviant sideshow, it was the centerpiece of leisure in the Roman Empire, and the fact that they gilded the entire structure in gold tells you something about how the people regarded this past time.

Even with the most abominable examples we can find in the modern world, like the Holocaust for example, the Nazis never degenerated to the point where the gassing of Jews became a public spectacle. It wasn't televised or celebrated. It was clear that this systematic genocide of an entire people was still regarded with a sense of shame, however small, because it was done with some measure of discretion. As openly racist and heinous as they were, they never made entertainment out of it. Now I'm not saying that religion or the Bible solved all the worlds problems. Obviously it created problems as well, but you have to understand the massive humanizing effect it had.

**That** is why the Bible is significant.

&gt; I really do not understand why such a vast number of people continue base their life upon these words; yes, a small group of people do use the faith of others to climb up the religious ladder so they can achieve the power of infallibility and be allowed to practice their perverted fantasies upon the followers, but most just follow blindly accepting anything they are told by their religious authority.

People imprint too much of their culture on Christianity. They think Jesus was a Republican or that Paul was a socialist, etc, etc. What they don't understand is that Christianity transcends all those things and to use it as a tool for control or politicizing is wrong. Jesus made that quite clear when the Pharisees confronted him about paying taxes. This was seen as a Catch-22 question: They asked Jesus if the Jews should pay their taxes or tithe to the temple. To say you shouldn't pay taxes and instead pay tithes was treason in the Roman Empire, and you would be arrested. To say that you should pay taxes and not tithe was to recognize the Roman emperor as a god, and therefore you would be a heretic. So Jesus asked who's face is on the denarius, to which the Pharisees reply, ""The caesar, of course,"" and Jesus says, ""Render unto caesar what is caesar's, and render unto God what is God's"". Which means politics and religion are not meant to intercede.

Paul also shatters the mindset of being overly mystical and relying on cult-like emotions in the Eastern mindset such as the Levant, but he also criticized the overly analytical, legalist and judgmental tradition of the Western mindset found in the Romans. People blindly follow because they do not think, and people take advantage of those followers because they do not feel.

Material: Get a summer wool.  It won't roast you during the year, and it wont look like a rumpled mess should you decide to make sudden movements(linen)

Vents:  If you are going for a boxier cut go with a single, and a slimmer cut should have double vents.

REALLY DONT GET NO VENT.  YOU WILL LOOK LIKE A HUGE TOOL.

Breasted:  Stick with single unless you are awesome in which case go double.  Double breasted can look great, but is ridiculously difficult to make casual.

This is basically a 3 button suit structured in a way so that the top button area around the lapels rolls back to reveal only two of the buttons.  if your tailor doesnt know what this is, do not do business with him.

,"I did not downvote you, but I do want to engage you in conversation about your beliefs because I think vaccinations are severely misunderstood and unappreciated in first world countries.

See, I come from a third world country. People here cannot afford quality healthcare, so the government subsidizes the costs of vaccines. Why? Because a vaccination is a few cents per person, while treatment of the actual disease costs a lot more.

You take vaccinations for granted, because you've never seen the effects of non-vaccination. I have. You see, there are quacks all around the world. In my country, which is a country of many cultures and faiths, a rumor was spread that vaccinations were actually a cover to sterilise minority communities. As a result, those same communities that were illiterate and who gave in to those fears saw a rise in preventable illnesses and deaths. Have you ever seen a child with polio? No, you haven't because it's been eradicated in the Western Hemisphere. I'll tell you what it looks like. Children struggling to walk and talk, with deformed limbs, struggling to fit into a society where even able bodied individuals in their socioeconomic class suffer on a daily basis.

Needless to say, it angers me when people make these claims without an understanding of what vaccines are and how they work. Because believe me, a society without vaccinations will be a time harkening back to the middle ages. Do you know what happens if you don't inoculate yourself against rabies and contract it? A slow, painful paralysis, usually leading to death when your lungs and heart stop working due to the toxins. There is no cure for some diseases, only a vaccination.

To your claims - vaccination is a quack science being first. I'd like for you to go back in time and tell this to European society. Do you know what the inoculation against smallpox was? A deliberate infection of cowpox. As disgusting as that sounds, cowpox is a mild, treatable disease. Smallpox is fatal. Thankfully, the bosy reacts to both identically. This inoculation against smallpox was the first vaccination to ever be created, and led to smallpox being nearly eradicated once enough people had been inoculated to make the disease nearly non-existent. Vaccination has been a field of study for over 200 years. Stating that it is quack science is akin to stating that powered flight is a hoodwink. Simply put, too many people have spent time and money researching and developing vaccines that actually work for a con like this to even be remotely possible.

The CDC and the WHO? They're the ones you depend on day to day, to protect you from Mad Cow, Salmonella, and god knows how many other diseases that could devastate entire populations. They have expertise in infectious diseases, and without realizing it, you depend on them on a daily basis, the same you depend on your electricity company to provide you power and your water company to provide you clean, running and consumable water. You will only realize their worth the day you shut them down and realize how much they've actually been doing in the background. Vaccinations are designed to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Remember what the CDC's field of expertise was?

Finally, every vaccine, like every medical treatment, carries a small risk of side effects. The days of deliberately infecting someone with a full-blown disease to protect against other, more fatal diseases has long passed. Today's vaccines are dead or dying bacteria that the body can easily fight off, and thus 'remember"" through the antibodies created how to fend off an attack by robust living bacteria. Children who have suppressed immune systems who are then given vaccines (and this number is minuscule) may actually go on to develop the full disease, but this number is again miniscule - on the order of 1 in every 100,000. This is a small risk that is completely acceptable given the alternative - a painful suffering and treatment, if not death, from an infectious disease.

That study linking vaccines to autism has since been revoked, and that doctor disbarred from medicine for falsifying data. No one has managed to replicate his findings, which is a critical requirement in science. You expect a plane to stay up every time it goes into the air, because of the strong level of peer review that went into the research of jet engines and wing design. Biological research is the same. Nothing is proven unless it can be replicated.

If you still believe vaccines are evil, and you ever get bitten by a snake, I would suggest you also reject the antivenom that you are offered, because the science that goes into it's creation is the same as the science that goes into the creation of vaccines.

,"From Hamas Charter:
""The Day of Judgement will not come about until Muslims fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Muslims, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. Only the Gharkad tree,  would not do that because it is one of the trees of the Jews.""

And for all you geniuses that say that that charter was written ""a long time ago"", here are some qoutes from recent years:

Imam Yousif al-Zahar of Hamas said in his sermon at the Katib Wilayat mosque in Gaza that ""Jews are a people who cannot be trusted. They have been traitors to all agreements. Go back to history. Their fate is their vanishing.""- 1 April 2008

Sheik Yunus al-Astal, a Hamas legislator and imam, in a column in the weekly newspaper Al Risalah in 2008 discussed a Koranic verse suggesting that ""suffering by fire is the Jews' destiny in this world and the next."" Astal concluded ""Therefore we are sure that the Holocaust is still to come upon the Jews.

""We will not rest until we destroy the Zionist entity"" stated Hamas leader Fathi Hammad in Gaza on Friday January 2nd 2009.

In a sermon aired on Hamas' Al-Aqsa television, cleric Yunis Al Astal stated, ""Today, Rome is the capital of the Catholics, or the Crusader capital, which has declared its hostility to Islam, and has planted the brothers of apes and pigs in Palestine in order to prevent the reawakening of Islam.
""I believe that our children, or our grandchildren, will inherit our jihad and our sacrifices, and, Allah willing, the commanders of the conquest will come from among them""

He maintained that Rome would become, """"an advanced post for the Islamic conquests, which will spread though Europe in its entirety, and then will turn to the two Americas, even Eastern Europe.""

Okay so, my responses to you:

1) I missed that part, the one with half the population rising against Obama.  It must have been because I was too busy watching the incredible work he was doing in his first 100 days (the most active any president has been since FDR, and I don't need to lecture you on him).  As for the threat level...I missed that part too, with, you know, 50% of the US population running around, armed, issuing veiled threats to Obama.

2) I think it's a little rash to compare SB 1070 to ""Nazism"".  Actually, the catholic church was the first one to make that distinction; and we all know that a huge amount of mexicans are catholic.  Read the provisions in the bill, and what it's modifier (HB 2162) allows for...it basically gives local law enforcement more power to enforce FEDERAL LAW.  In the interest of educating you on the facts, I'll let you look that up instead of summarizing it.  After all, I'm an informed American citizen and voter.  

3) South Carolina?  Google ""Alvin Greene"".  Now, do you want to use more quotes from elected (or aspiring) politicians from that state?

4) Walmart employee ordering ""n****s"" to leave the store...not an employee.  A teenager who jumped on the intercom.  Get your story straight.

5) My blindfold?  I've been stationed in the South for 6 years now.  I'm originally from New England.  I'm serving my country, alongside whites, blacks, hispanics, asians, you name it.  How dare you suggest my views could ""enable a lynching or two.""  Perhaps it's your own ignorant views on Americans that makes you say something like that.

I'm reminded of something one of my British buddies, a fellow pilot, told me while we were in Afghanistan.  He said, ""We Europeans give Americans such a hard time because we're jealous of you.""  Coming from him, I take that as gospel.  You seem to be a great example of that mindset.

,"I agree, it probably wasn't simply intelligence that gave us an advantage over similar species.

Take Neanderthals, for example. We don't actually know whether they were more or less intelligent than us. Their intelligence was probably similar to that of homo sapiens, but I don't think intelligence was the main factor that gave us an advantage.

The biggest physical difference between us and them was that Neanderthals were much stronger than our ancestors, and I suspect that this led to their extinction. It's counterintuitive: surely the average Neanderthal would have beaten the average Sapiens in hand to hand combat, but all of this muscle had a cost. A Neanderthal would have required much more food to stay alive, or to put it another way, a given amount of food (which would have been in short supply in Ice Age Europe) would have supported a larger population of Sapiens. A hundred Neanderthals wouldn't have had a chance against 300 Sapiens, and over a few millenia we drove them to extinction through sheer numbers.

I'm not an expert either, and I'm not aware of any research that supports this hypothesis, but I think the general idea is sound: there are many factors that determined which of the competing species prevailed, and intelligence was just one.

[Muslim Rape Epidemic in Sweden and Norway - Authorities Look the Other Way ](http://fjordman.blogspot.com/2005/02/muslim-rape-epidemic-in-sweden-and.html)

&gt;Alarmed at last week's police statistics, which revealed that in 68% of all rapes committed this year the perpetrator was from an ethnic minority, leading Muslim organizations have now formed an alliance to fight the ever-growing problem of young second and third-generation immigrants involved in rape cases against young Danish girls.

""The Problem"" I see, is with immigration, and a concentration of a specified people, you transfer the behaviors, cultural norms, and unspoken laws of that people.  A close nit community of immigrants *will* maintain many of the values of their ethnic origin.  The thing about islamic peoples, the thing that defines them more than anything else *culturally* **is** their religion (in the majority of cases).

On one side of the coin you have people up in arms fighting for the rights of women in faraway distant lands, attempting to change the ways of many *fundamentalist* views often embedded in the *local religion*, but on the other people hide behind Political Correctness to whitewash any trace of a specific religion from a common theme when it's in a land that is more progressive.

People don't change that quickly just because you move them geographically, I can speak from experience, in almost all these cases.  I have visited the middle east on more than one occasion, I lived in France in the mid 90's for 5 years, and I am currently living in south Florida, where Miami is an alien world compared to most of the US because of the large Hispanic community here.  Only a blind person wouldn't be able to track the cultural influences from foreign lands to where immigrants, especially of common ethnicities, congregate.  

&gt;The community should be the focus, but you're more intent on training the lens on what you characterize as an Islamic-based subculture. By ignoring the fact that everyone involved lives in the banlieues, the issues regarding recidivist poverty, unemployment, nativist rejection, and law enforcement are all conveniently removed. I suppose it's a lot simpler to blame everything on the ""problem of Muslim immigration"" but then again, you're more interested in ""powerful rhetoric"" than anything else.

,"I assume so because, as you say, if someone does attack, we'll all be dead. We won. Whatever. End of story. No one else in history had the means to destroy their attackers entirely while being, themselves, destroyed.

And of course I bring up ICBMs, how the fuck else are they going to get their bombs here to destroy a significant chunk of the US without getting destroyed before they can pull off the attack.

I didn't say it was super advanced, but making them requires a lot of money. That was my point. There is no way a country that can build something that complicated can't desalinate their fucking water. Do you understand? You like saying this is old technology. Guess what, fucking desalination was being done before humans ever fucking existed. They can fucking do it.

As for my so called assumptions, I am assuming state action because non-state action will not be enough to destroy the US, Europe, Russia, or China. The best you get is terrorism which is quite different from destruction. If there isn't a state involved, then they will not have enough power to take down the US (mutually assured or not). Sure, they might want to, but they won't be able to. They won't be able to move enough troops fast enough (lets say to get them into the US where we would, presumably, be unwilling to nuke ourselves), nor will they be able to travel to the US without getting decimated.

Because, while I like to mention nukes and ICBMs, as you say, they are old technology. Thank god they aren't all we have to depend on. Thank god that, if there were to be a game changing weapons development, it would most likely be developed in a country like China, if not traditional places like the US, Europe, or Russia. Therefore, the poor people who you'd like so much to defeat the western developed countries will most likely not be the ones to be able to use these advances to ""surprise"" us and defeat us for our water. No, it will instead be the other way around. The advanced countries will be the ones who get even more advanced. Too bad.

These poor countries wouldn't even be able to move their troops, by either air or sea, without getting them destroyed by someone's navy. They will be too poor to afford the fast ships, too poor to arm them correctly, too poor to get adequate anti-air weaponry, and altogether TOO POOR TO FUCKING FIGHT. DO YOU FUCKING UNDERSTAND NOW? Fighting in the modern age requires money and if you've got fucking money you've got the money to desalinate water! So this so called ""water shortage"" is really a problem of undeveloped nations and it does not concern the rich at all. Because we are not, in any way, threatened by those countries.

You keep bringing up history, but all those countries were on a much more even technological playing field.

It wasn't even that long ago that US and Europe saved Kuwait from Iraq for goodness sake. Today there are alot of powers that are held in check by the mere threat of international intervention. But if tomorrow the US and Europe said 'screw it we won't have any more militaries and can't do anything anymore' you would see invasions and wars happen the day after.

,"&gt; In the first population, there is a small set of rules with extremely harsh punishments for those who violate them.
&gt; In the second population, there is a massive set of rules with moderate punishments for those who violate them.

Now this is where I wonder if you know enough about Europe again. I just don't know if there are that many more rules in European countries than there are in the US. Oh there are a few well known exceptions in a few countries (Burka in France, Nazi party in Germany), but I wouldn't necessarily jump to the conclusion that European countries have a ""massive"" set of rules.

I just can't recall ever wanting to do anything that was stopped by a law, while it has constantly been an issue in the US (don't make terrorist jokes in queues! don't drink in cars! don't smoke weed! don't take photographs of beaches with corporate activity going on!)

&gt; Which is the ""more free"" population? The one with more people in prison, or the one in which the non-imprisoned peoples have more of their lives regulated and dictated?

Someone's been watching Fox News. I'd say European lives are probably less regulated and dictated than American ones, but I'm sure you have some facts you can quote that show that European people have lots of things they can't do that they could do in the US.

Gun control is probably the easiest thing, but even that varies greatly between the EU nations, with the ones with least prisoners often having the most lose gun control (read: the Nordics).

Is it fear and hardship that makes people of one country more religious than another, or is there a mysterious third factor that can explain why some nations pray so much more than others?

The fact that the US is more individualistic (as a culture), and hence the income inequality is bigger might explain why it's also more religious. Europe and East Asia, on the other hand are more socially oriented, with a much smaller income inequality. The most irreligious countries in europe are the northern countries, which also have a leftist approach to social issues.

,"So many variables that you can't make any predictions with confidence. But here's a couple of big ones that spring to mind:

1) Slavery. Abolished in the British Empire in 1807, would have saved an awful lot of trouble if North America had followed suit.

2) WW1. Assuming the US (which presumably wouldn't be its name but lets use it for convenience) was of similar status to Canada and Australia at the time then you'd have automatically joined the war in 1914. It seems reasonable to assume that it would finished a lot sooner so perhaps that would even have averted the Russian Revolution too.

But perhaps more interesting would be the aftermath. The convoluted negotiations that followed the armistice were orchestrated by Woodrow Wilson. He had good intentions but streaks of idealism and naivety meant the Treaty of Versailles turned out pretty much guaranteeing a future war.

I grabbed my phone in my pocket, but thought this would be a bad idea, since the guy was beating up the other guy over grabbing his phone. I moved to a small alley around the corner and dialed 112 (European 911) and told them what was happening. I said I couldn't judge whether an ambulance was needed, so they connected me to the local cops. The cops were driving around the area to 
 find them (I gave them a good description), but they didn't find anyone. So I went back and saw that the man was in the cafe, and I called them up again to tell them so. 

Then yesterday morning at 5 am, I hear screaming (women and men). My gf and I go check what's up and there's police all over and a guy bleeding. My gf (in her PJ's) says to the cop she's a doctor and she asks me to go get her medical bag. She does what she can to help till the ambulance arrives.

,"English Australian here; a thousand thank yous to you sir, for speaking the plain truth. 

I think it is a considerable hindrance to our historical perspective as Westerners that we basically start out with the simplistic equation of Hitler = 'pure, Platonic incarnation of evil' before we even begin our studies of that part of history or of the man. Which is what he was. He was a man. I actually don't think he was a) evil, or b) a genius. 

So far as being evil goes, I think the collective psychology of his society at that point in history was pretty fucking evil. He grew up in the peak of European Imperialism. The whole mindset of that period of history was infused with ideas of white supremacy and very brutal terms of discussion. 

I think our over-demonization of Hitler is our way of either apologizing for or even distracting from the plethora of evil shit going in our ""superior"" white society at that time. And European Antisemitism goes back two thousand years. 

The fact is Hitler, we can't divorce Hitler from **us** (white Europeans). He was a man of the times (die Zeitgeist). He *was* a man of the people, of the thinking and psychology of that era. Just as Mussolini, Franco and Stalin were men of their times as well.

Secondly, he wasn't a genius. He was a genius at motivating people, and at utilising other people's good ideas, that is all. One of the biggest reasons behind Nazi Germany's multiple military failures was Hitlers interference in his generals' strategies. He also refused to invade England on racial grounds, and failed to befriend disenchanted Eastern European/West Asian populations (angry at Stalin) also for racial reasons which cost him those conquered territories. In fact, most of what made him so successful was the product of racist nationalism born of European expansion at that point in history. I doubt if anything similar could be replicated today (and especially not in India), and personally, I'd have to argue that Hitlers management style is more of a historical curiosity, not a practical one.",1278245713,c0thpt6,False,,[deleted],1426366448,0,t5_2qh13,0,True,6,0,t1_c0thpt6,False,t1_c0thc44,6,t3_clqkz,,worldnews

,"Having lived in both, Finland and UK I would argue that population is not the main reason for differences in the infrastructure between the two countries. The main difference between the two countries that I have seen is that in Finland they seem to constantly invest more into building the infrastructure whereas in UK the focus is on reaping the largest possible profits from existing customers without investing into new infrastructure. 

When BBC introduced BBC iPlayer on-demand service there were massive complaints from ISPs that it would cripple their infrastructure and BBC should pay them. When Yle (the Finnish equivalent of BBC) introduced its on-demand service I heard no complaints from ISPs. Of course the issue is not as black and white as that but I feel that the focus in strategy for ISPs is completely different in the two countries. I have not done any real research into this but this is my impression from living in the two countries as a consumer and from reading the newspapers.

,"I'm not really sure that's the case. Yes, there are some very high visibility projects in alternative energy. Politicians love these. ""They"" propose a giant new wind/solar farm with X MW capacity, get in the news and get re-elected on a green platform etc. Theoretically, it's good for the alternative energy project too. They get a little more experience building another example of whatever the technology was selected and can put a little more money into R&amp;D. This is dependent on how the installer uses the money. 

I'm going to talk about wind and solar because I've done more reading on these and the majority of new projects seem to use these technologies anyway. Geothermal and hydro are great when they're feasible but that's location dependent (they have their own problems though). Believe it or not wind and solar, wind especially, are pretty mature technologies. We're not going to get huge leaps in efficiency anytime soon. The real issue is energy storage and most of these alternative energy projects don't spend too much time on that. They don't have to because the politicians already gave them very favorable subsidized rates. They just collect the energy, turn it into electricity, feed it into the grid and collect their money. Unfortunately, with the centralized grid system we use, this ends up costing the grid money. Centralized grids like to deliver just a bit more power than is demanded at any given second. Too much and you've got to burn or sell it off before you blow up the grid. Too little and you better find more (or shut down sections) or you'll blow up the grid. This means that, not only are you paying a premium for the ""clean"" electricity, you're paying someone else a premium to take the extra power when you don't need it or you're simply wasting it by running it through resistor banks. Also, you have to build fast reacting power plants that will make up the unmet demand when the wind isn't blowing or the sun isn't shining. In reality, you've got 2 choices, hydro or natural gas/oil. If you've got hydro, then no problem, just open the gates a little more when the wind isn't blowing and you can meet demand with other clean energy. If you don't have a full reservoir, you'll need a standby natural gas or oil plant (often in combination with coal - a bit slower reacting but capable of delivery more power because coal plants tend to be built bigger). This plant must be kept idling 24/7, ready to kick in when the wind dies down. You're using pretty much the same amount of fossil fuel to idle the plant waiting for use (usually during peak hours for wind power) compared to if you just forgot the wind mills and used the fossil fuel plant directly. Same for solar but not as bad in terms of fossil fuel usage because solar is often available when the daily peaks occur (although, most of the first world countries are not ideal locations for solar because of high latitudes). Basically, every time a wind mill or solar plant goes up, you need to build standby gas/coal plants simultaneously or risk destabilizing the grid. Some places skirt the issue by buying electricity from a neighboring state, but someone, somewhere has to make up for the power when the wind isn't blowing or the sun isn't shining. 

Like I said before - unless/until we get better energy storage technology, wind and solar are basically feel good political projects. It won't hurt to keep some (small number) around but large-scale replacement of nuclear (and that's what's happening in Europe last I heard) with these two technologies really isn't doing that much good. I personally believe we're much better off getting rid of coal plants, replacing them with nuclear (and geothermal and hydro where available) and use quick reacting, clean burning natural gas plants for peaking supplies.

,"tl:dr 

The questions the EU are asking:

Question 1: Is there currently a problem of net neutrality and the openness of the internet in 
Europe? If so, illustrate with concrete examples. Where are the bottlenecks, if any? Is the 
problem such that it cannot be solved by the existing degree of competition in fixed and 
mobile access markets? 


Question 2: How might problems arise in future? Could these emerge in other parts of the 
internet value chain? What would the causes be?  


Question 3: Is the regulatory framework capable of dealing with the issues identified, 
including in relation to monitoring/assessment and subsequent enforcement? 


Question 4: To what extent is traffic management necessary from an operators' point of 
view? How is it carried out in practice? What technologies are used to carry out such traffic 
management? 


Question 5: To what extent will net neutrality concerns be allayed by the provision of 
transparent information to end users, which distinguishes between managed services on the 
one hand and services offering access to the public internet on a 'best efforts' basis, on the 
other?  


Question 6: Should the principles governing traffic management be the same for fixed and 
mobile networks? 


Question 7: What other forms of prioritisation are taking place? Do content and application 
providers also try to prioritise their services? If so, how – and how does this prioritisation 
affect other players in the value chain? 


Question 8: In the case of managed services, should the same quality of service conditions 
and parameters be available to all content/application/online service providers which are in 
the same situation? May exclusive agreements between network operators and 
content/application/online service providers create problems for achieving that objective? 


Question 9: If the objective referred to in Question 8 is retained, are additional measures 
needed to achieve it? If so, should such measures have a voluntary nature (such as, for 
example, an industry code of conduct) or a regulatory one? 


Question 10: Are the commercial arrangements that currently govern the provision of access 
to the internet adequate, in order to ensure that the internet remains open and that 
infrastructure investment is maintained? If not, how should they change? 


Question 11: What instances could trigger intervention by national regulatory authorities in 
setting minimum quality of service requirements on an undertaking or undertakings providing 
public communications services?  


Question 12:  How should quality of service requirements be determined, and how could they 
be monitored? 


Question 13: In the case where NRAs find it necessary to intervene to impose minimum 
quality of service requirements, what form should they take, and to what extent should there 
be co-operation between NRAs to arrive at a common approach? 

 
Question 14: What should transparency for consumers consist of? Should the standards 
currently applied be further improved?  


Question 15: Besides the traffic management issues discussed above, are there any other 
concerns affecting freedom of expression, media pluralism and cultural diversity on the 
internet? If so, what further measures would be needed to safeguard those values?

,"I do not think Israel has any legitimate right to exist. 

It is a colonial state that has no more justification than the French in Algeria/Vietnam, England in Kenya/India, or the Dutch in South Africa. 

Zionism is an insult to Judaism, that has enforced itself based on justifications from a European narrative unto the Jews internationally (because, Indian, Arab, Ethiopian, and other non-European Jews did not face the same experience as their European peers). 

Israel is also a racist state that denys the original indeginious inhabitants their right to live in a free and just matter. 

So I do think Thoma's words were brave, especially in the America, where it is a climate that is majorily supportive towards Israel (whilst the rest of the international community is not a fan).  

and I do think, a fair and just solution is a one democratic secular state with the protection of rights of all. 

So in the face of how the international world is, both Helen Thomas and Mr. Stauffer's comments and analysis is highly commendable and credible. 

You have your biases, of course. 
But don't be a fool and let these biases cloud the hard facts. To help you with your bias, you can read ""Overcoming Zionism"" by Joel Kovel, ""The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestinians"" by Ilan Pappe, ""Righteous Victims"" by the racist Benny Morris, who was clear about the Zionists intentions to ethnically cleanse the indeginous population, you can also read the various UN reports, diaries of Zionist leader (they were surprisingly frank), the statements by Bishop Desmond Tutu, Ghandi (in regards to the rights of the Palestinians), and so forth. Perhaps that would help in your blinding bias towards Israel.

Using deep burn reactors will enable use of the nuclear waste which contains unburned nuclear fuel. China, Russia and India are building breeder reactors and deeper burn reactors now. Research on deeper burn continues in Europe and the USA too.

The 4 billion tons in seawater are easier to get than from granite and get replenished by erosion. Japan and India are working on scaling up extraction of uranium from seawater.

,"1. Nobody knows how old Hinduism is really. As the oldest texts to attest for it only come from around 400 AD.   Of course, it probably goes back a ways further....  But it definitely is not as old as ancient Egyptian.  But then, nothing of any modern religion is that old.   

2. Swastika is the word we use in the modern world.  But it's wide spread use dates to after 1871, when it replaced several other words then in use, such as gammadion (from Greek), fylfot (from Celtic) or mundilfari (from old Norse).  Heck, even the Tibetan term for the symbol: g-yung drung, has nothing to do with the Sanskrit and they grew up in the general proximity.

And pretty much all Sanskrit words in use widely around the world post-date the British Empire, and the Brits adopting the various words out of Hindi or other some other language of India, and not from any ancient source or anything.    If anything, if there is a commonality the loan would have most likely come from an Indo European root source, and not from Hindi or Sanskrit, whose old influence was limited to the subcontinent.    That means that Sanskrit may just as likely have been the borrower as to have been the originator.

,"You seem to be downvoted here, but as a fellow cop family member, I agree. 

I've never had it happen to *me* ... but then again in NYC I'm usually with my father-in-law, aunt and/or uncle who are on the job, or carrying my PBA card. Cops don't usually even bother me, but yeah, I have the family card and don't feel bad about using it to avoid the shit the rest of you deal with. 

I have seen some amazing shit in NYC though. I've seen guys on the job drinking and enjoying private dancers in a lower floor lounge near the parade route on March 17. On the same day I saw a drunk cop smash a Puerto Rican Girl's face into a bumper for blowing a whistle (yes, she was annoying, blowing it in a ""fuck the Irish kind of way ...). The drunk walked away as soon as a friend came to arrest the girl. From what I can tell, they said the sober guy did the ""arrest and takedown"". 

Here is the difference. Europeans don't really see how it's possible someone was beaten to a pulp and had teeth knocked out by 200+ pound men for blowing a whistle. They certainly don't get how a switch like that was made on a road with (what does the parade route have per block?) maybe 1000 people on it.

,"""The Jews have been the oppressed minority"" 

Is that the European narrative? Because if you actually read up on Middle Eastern history and spoke with Arab Jews (and read their accounts, diaries, and history), they worked within the state, were highly important in the academic circles, and culturally and economically flourished. This was whilst Europeans where doing the Spanish Inquisition thing (no one expects the Spanish Inquisition) and were committing pogroms after terrible pogroms. 

So please, spare me the Zionist historical myths and try reading these accounts, you can find them translated in English. Mark you, it was until after 1948 that things went bad for the Arab Jews (however, lets not forget the Mossad's role in bombing synagogues in Iraq - very well reported on and you can find this in the public domain- in order to create fright and flight.) If you actually look at where they immigrated to, many choice the States because they did not buy the Zionist lie. 
Syrian Jews left because of the economic and political hardships in Syria that everyone faced, they mostly went to New York and New Jersey, where this is a large community. 

I do care about racism in general, and i abhore every racist state, mine included. So no, your logic of ""oh theres racism over there, so its ok to be racist"" is silly in my mind. I abhore pan-Arabism for its exclusivity, and I abohore all religious states because they fail in adequently representing minorities. 

This ""magic"" is practical, your attitude was the same that Afrikkaners had in the 1980s...they were quite wrong. It is also racist because it assumes the inability for the population to live together. 

We have been living quite well for thousands of years, until the Europeans came along with their Zionism - hence your riots of the 20s,30s, and 40s directed towards European Jews, not Jews. Not to mention the role England played in adding to the tensions, and not to mention the use of car bombs (first of its kind in the region, i cite Buda's Wagon - A History of the Car Bomb) and other forms of terrorism by the Haganah, the Irgun, and the Stern Gang (who transformed to the, ironically called, Israel Defense Force) that probably added to the tensions. 

So let me know when you take into account history, rather than the parroting of a pamphlet you read in a pro-Israel lecture or meeting. 

Again, I highly suggest reading the accounts of Arab Jews (one of the first fighters against Zionism actually), and the accounts of other Jews who do not by the Zionist myth.

I don't think the EU is weak because of resources or coherency though, I think it's weak because no one takes them seriously.

So the problem isn't that they don't have positions, it's that they haven't given the world a reason to give a damn what their positions are.

America of course is on the other end of this. The world cares about (and resents us for) our positions because we've taken such aggressive ones...economically, militarily and politically.. Our barbs are so obvious we're called imperialists.

In order for the EU to gain 'power', they need to somehow force America off of it's most prized positions of influence(the IMF and whatnot), and make it clear their policies have bite without being an aggressor themselves.

,"I'm no expert in anthropology, but if I recall correctly, monogamy is hardly a western invention. Some cultures practice polygamy, and some even polyandromy, but even in those cases fidelity is expected--if not always practiced. Faithful, monogamous relationships are pretty standard, from the !Kung to the Teduray. Margaret Meade pushed something like this in *Coming of Age in Samoa*, saying that this culture, free from the influence of prudish Europeans, was one where free-love flourished. The Samoans were *pissed*. They found it very insulting that they were portrayed as what they viewed as morally loose. Of course, what's expected socially and what actually happens are very different; even the Amish have a humorously high rate of infidelity, but there seem to be very few, if any, cultures where this infidelity is encouraged. If polyamory were really the natural state of humanity, you'd expect it to be the norm in at least a sizable fraction of cultures.

,"Okay.  I'm a US citizen that lived in the UK for an extended period of time.  I lived just outside Edinburgh with my husband (who is from Scotland).  We now live in the US, but here is an outsiders view on the UK. 

LIKE:  I love the history of the UK.  There is nothing more amazing than walking at night through the lit streets of Edinburgh looking at the old buildings.  It takes awhile to get used to the fact that there is a castle in the middle of a freakin' city!  And outside of the city.  And in the countryside.  I love the people (for the most part).  They are friendly and will always offer a cuppa tea.  And another.  The pub life is great.  Want a drink and friendly chat at 11 am?  Walk down the street to the local pub.  Chippys are awesome!  Want some greasy food at 1 am?  Walk down the street to the local chippy.  The public transportation is amazing.  There is no need for a car.  Want to spend a weekend in London?  Grab the express train from Waverly Station and you will be there in 4 hours.  Want to travel to the mainland Europe?  CHEAP air travel through carriers such as EasyJet and RyanAir.  It's possible to go to France for the day and be home in time to go to work the next day.  I could go on and on about my likes.

DISLIKES:  Now I know this is also a problem in the US, but I noticed it more in the UK.  People living off of the government.  There is no incentive to work if you are a single mother.  Girls are popping out kids at 16 and are rewarded with free/cheap housing, utility allowances, food allowances, and spending money.  Too much time on their hands and they pop out more kids.  This makes a cycle of leaving school at 16 (in Scotland anyway) and having kids.  It seems to be a newer problem and needs to be fixed.  There has to be incentive to get these girls back in school and get them to be productive members of society.  There are not many people who know what they want to do with their lives at age 16.  School should be mandatory until 18.  Also, there is a large heroin problem.  A few of my husband's friends have gone this route and either died or are in jail.  It's a shame.  Another reason why school should be mandatory until 18.  16 year olds with too much time on their hands getting into trouble.  I know this is also not just a UK problem, but once again, I guess I just noticed it more in the UK.  Last is the big brother state of the UK.  Cameras everywhere.  And you can't photograph/video police or you can be arrested.  Seems sketchy.  

Sorry for the long post.  I love the UK and can't wait to move back someday.  ",1278264819,c0ti4pb,False,,JustAGirl81,1426366643,0,t5_2qh1i,0,True,7,0,t1_c0ti4pb,False,t3_clwkb,7,t3_clwkb,,AskReddit

,"The PLO was dreamt up by the KGB, which had a penchant for “liberation” organizations. The KGB also created the Democratic Front for the Liberation  of Palestine, which carried out numerous bombing attacks on the “Palestinian territories” occupied by Israel, and the “Secret Army for Liberation of Armenia,” created by the KGB in 1975, which organized numerous bombing attacks against US airline offices in Western Europe.

In 1964 the first PLO Council, consisting of 422 Palestinian representatives handpicked by the KGB, approved the Palestinian National Charter—a document that had been drafted in Moscow. The Palestinian National Covenant and the Palestinian Constitution were also born in Moscow, with the help of Ahmed Shuqairy, a KGB influence agent who became the first PLO chairman.  This new PLO was headed by a Soviet-style Executive Committee made up of 15 members who, like their comrades in Moscow, also headed departments. As in Moscow—and Bucharest—the chairman of the Executive Committee became the general commander of the armed forces as well. The new PLO also had a General Assembly, which was the Soviet-inspired name given to all East European parliaments after World War II.

 

Based on another “socialist division of labor,” the Romanian espionage service (DIE) was responsible for providing the PLO with logistical support. Except for the arms, which were supplied by the KGB and the East German Stasi, everything else came from Bucharest. Even the PLO uniforms and the PLO stationery were manufactured in Romania free of charge, as a “comradely help.” During those years, two Romanian cargo planes filled with goodies for the PLO landed in Beirut every week, and were unloaded by Arafat’s men.

EU is a union based on economy, it is a bit political but lets be honest, I cannot remember the last time EU could agree on a controversial political topic. Every major country in the EU has its agenda and try to steer EU in that direction, the result is just a lot of talk and no action.

Funnily enough I think that this will be a winning strategy. This talk about ""peace and security"" is mostly bullshit anyway. It comes down to using military force to push through one's agenda.

,"This is very simple. I am old and I lived those times.

You know having a bunch of missiles waiting to be launched by extremists at the top of the USSR, when the USSR was an imperialist totalitarian regime and free countries were few, was uncomfortable. In those times Jimmy Carter was saying he didn't know if he would dare to reply if ever the Soviets decide to launch a nuclear attack over Europe. To make it clear to the Soviets who were warming their tanks to the invite, France who was not even in NATO had to reply that whatever Western European country was under attack France would consider it a national cause and would reply with its own nukes. 
Meanwhile USSR was waging war everywhere and its military budget was topping around 50% of its GNP (nearly everything produced was for the army), Jimmy Carter was fighting to drop that budget below 4% in the US. I thought that guy was a felon and I am not so sure today he really wasn't and that there wasn't more than just claiming to be a peace and love supporter. He was also a supporter in economics of growth rate 0 and social redistribution to provide wealthiness instead. I'll let you think a bit about that, as we know this didn't work in the 70s and nobody believes in this anymore.

So when Reagan came to promote all the opposite and put people at work and raised the economy and the defense spendings, it was a relief. However, Carter made his fans to believe that to live as a red (a commie) is better worth than to die for freedom, and Reagan spent some time to make those people change their mind, and he has to be praised for that because very few people would have been able to achieve this.

Monsanto crops don't ruin the soil for other uses.  Also, Monsanto crops don't require any specific fertilizer, no matter what you may hear in the movies.

Local farmers are ""supposed"" to compete by offering a better value than Monsanto seeds.  That means either cheaper or better.  You know, the same rules Monsanto had to follow to get into the marketplace in the first place.  Are you suggesting that we should force people to buy inferior seeds at a higher price?

When it ended up just being him and Chamberlin, who was in Zwan with him and who he later fired (or so he now claims), people were disappointed.

The fact that two of the former Pumpkins aren't on speaking terms with him is probably evidence that he's an asshole.

I also don't blame him for not wanting to keep playing their songs from 15 years ago, but that's typically what bands do when they reunite, although it has already been established that this reunion wasn't. Fans are going to have expectations, and Billy is an idiot for not realizing that.

They're a larger economic unit, but they're not positioned as strongly. We pretty much own the IMF, have the corporations headquartered here, and control a huge amount of the capital that gets loaned to international corporations. That's not something that sheer economic *size* can compensate for necessarily. Control over the flow of capital especially is important.

""Higher standard of living"" is kind of relative, but either way: standard of living does not translate into power.

Stop hating on the Jews, seriously. You've got quite a hard-on on them. Do you hate them? Because you've been vomiting alot of nonsense about em. The word is Zionists here, who aren't Jews. No more or less like Wahhabis, who aren't Muslims, or the Crusaders Christian. If you can't seem to understand that concept, then you need to truly broaden your outlook. It wasn't a personal attack, I don't know you or care to, to even conduct such an act. It was merely an observation based on your logic and your examples.

I hope not. The only just and comprehensive solution is not based on ethnic states, and quasi-democracies.

,"I'll respond with an anecdote.

I live in Denver Colorado. Two summers ago we hosted the Democratic National Convention when Obama where Obama was officially nominated by the party for president of the united states. In the months leading up to the convention we had all of the crazies coming out of the woodwork to threaten Denver. 

The ""recreate 68"" folks promised to burn down the city. The far lunatic fringe on the right wanted to literally kill Obama. Veterans groups planned war protest marches... in short, there was a better than not chance of complete chaos (see Toronto right now).

The point being: This was a high pressure situation. Living Downtown, I saw the whole thing unfold everyday. I saw police officers, dressed in literal riot gear, helping folks find things in the city. I saw them posing for photographs. I saw them laughing and socializing the thousands of folks attending the convention. They could not have been better.

I saw them utilize reasonable force when the hooligans decided to try to shut down two of our busiest streets. They didn't kill anyone.. they simply herded them onto another street and made some arrests when the crowd wouldn't disperse. I was honestly impressed by how well the whole thing was handled (of course, there was plenty of lunacy all over the Internet decrying the 'police brutality'... which of course was as far from the truth as you could get).

The point being: Our police are a lot like yours... which you'll find is generally true about most things. It's considered 'cool' among young folks to be anti-establishment right now and that's why you see basically non-stop hating on the United States these days. Things aren't even in the vicinity of what you probably think is going on over here (and vice-versa, after all we're all pretty sure that all of Europe has given way to anti-immigrant violence).

Come on over, I think you'll be surprised about how polite and sensible 99% of our cops are. That doesn't excuse the ones who do horrible things and hide behind their badges.

,"&gt; Can't have multiple truths

In the religious and ethical sense, yes you can, and they are very few and far between. These different truths you speak of are simply different ways of explaining the same truth. It's like saying there's only one way to explain how to tie a shoe: obviously not true. Now to your first point:

&gt;The only way religion will play a part in world peace is if it ""unifies"" all of the world under one religion

Sure, that's one way... OR they could simply stop claiming that unnecessary dogma of religious exclusivity that you still cling to despite being an atheist.

&gt;I've seen how religion and it's belief express itself; The Dark Ages, suicide bombers, holy wars, The Crusades, etc. etc. ad infinitum.

You've seen the Crusades and the Dark Ages? How _old_ are you? And by the way, it's ""its"". 

Let's start with the dark ages. The dark ages weren't called the dark ages because everyone was religious. They were called the dark ages because every time a European country would start to gain even the slightest bit of wealth, they'd be overrun by the vikings, huns, goths, franks, and the occasional turks. Also there were the various plagues, ""little ice ages"", and other natural phenomena that greatly hindered European economic and cultural development. This had nothing to do with the church. If anything, Christianity was responsible for getting Europe through the dark ages in one piece. The monks and clerics were nearly the only literate people who had access to the scientific advancements of the muslim world (due in no small part to the crusades) and were able to safeguard such knowledge until the political powers of the time could figure out how to not get invaded. Oddly enough, the barbarian invasions even only stopped once they converted to Christianity.

Now for the crusades. You clearly haven't read any history from that time period, or else you would have been aware that they were nothing more than a landgrab for the middle eastern trade routes. Jerusalem, Damascus, Joppa, and Tyre were the central hubs of world trade, connecting Africa, Asia, and Europe. Any western holds on those cities would give europeans access to the riches, technologies, and resources they needed to fend off their invaders. Do a little more reading on the history before making more blind accusations about holy wars.

And suicide bombers: really?! You're going there? You're going to hold not just all muslims, but all religious adherents past and present for the actions of a bunch of bushwacking arab and azeri rednecks from afganistan, yemen, and saudi arabia. If you were just blaming Islam for it, that'd still be like holding all white people accountable for the oklahoma city bombing.

&gt;It wasn't a personal attack, I don't know you or care to, to even conduct such an act. It was merely an observation based on your logic and your examples.

No, they are personal attacks. That you claim they are true does not detract from it, it is simply an attempt to make the attack again.

&gt;What just solution would you offer to the Palestinians?

Abbas made a reasonable offer recently. Something along those lines would work for me.

&gt;the Refugees, who have a legal and moral right to return to their homes? 

If you mean the Palestinians, then one of the issues is that the Arabs need to start taking responsibility for their actions. They picked some fights, thinking they were easy victories, and they lost. But I'll tell you want, when the rest of the 50 or so million refugees from the 1945-1950 period return to their previous countries we can talk about the Palestinians returning.

&gt;The only solution should be equal rights and dignity for all, 

And, again, how are you going to achieve this magic with Hamas and Fatah leading the Palestinians? How are you going to achieve this magic given the entire range of Arab nations and pretty much all Muslim nations? What path do you see that will achieve this? When you can find a way to make half of the Arab world provide equal rights and dignity for all, then you can talk about changing Israel.

,"Thanks, you're welcome.  I find facts contribute better than downvotes!

For starters, anyone who does their hair in the morning will be less likely to want to wear a helmet.  So that rules out a fair chunk of the youth/young adult market just as they're considering buying a car, and many women as well.  Sad but true...

The places I'm referring to are in cycling-conscious Europe, yes.  But that doesn't change the fact that in those places, the increased overall safety of cyclists is clearly *not* attributable to helmets.  Where helmets *have* been introduced the *rate* of cycling injuries actually increases, per km of cycling.  Namely, the number of injuries does not drop significantly, while the number of people cycling *does*.

Which leads us to your last point, which is laudable, but based on incorrect assumptions formed by extrapolating a single case to an entire population - your total medical costs per cyclist will actually probably *increase*.  And the lifetime health costs of cyclists are lower than that of non-cyclists, overall.  One can (quite accurately) over-simplify the conclusion chain to this: mandatory bike helmets lead to *increased* public health costs, overall.  There is quite a lot of evidence to support this, even if the conclusions must be drawn yourself.

There *is* evidence to support some people's believe that they are safer *without* a helmet - they're less likely to be involved in an accident in the first place, and in an accident, the benefit of helmets is marginal, so perhaps that cyclist without a helmet also has your public health premiums in mind.

In a nutshell, cycling safety comes down to the behaviour of drivers; no amount of helmets will protect from the mass of a car vs a cyclist.  The issue inflames passions because it's obvious that *if* you're in an accident, a helmet will help.  But accidents affect a tiny percentage of cyclists on any given day, and more cyclists makes more cyclists safer.

So there's a strong argument for **always** wearing a helmet, while **never** mandating one.  Kinda catch 22, in fact.",1278304350,c0tj65b,False,,HeathenCyclist,1426367126,0,t5_2qi0s,0,True,2,0,t1_c0tj65b,False,t1_c0tj3yh,2,t3_cltc9,,bicycling

,"Interesting.  I too found that effects that seem to be linked to nightshade were generally getting worse as I got older.  There was a fair bit of fluctuation, but it's like the peaks were getting more extreme over the years until I figured out about not eating nightshade.  

It seems like there's a range of effects that are sensitive to this stuff experience, and different people experience those effects to various degrees for a given level of exposure/accumulation.  

For example, nausea is one of the classic symptoms of SGA poisoning (the main type of toxins in nightshade).  I experienced it at times, but not nearly to the degree you describe for tomato/tomatillo, and it only kicked in for me when things got extreme.  On the other hand, I, your friend, and another friend of mine experience the anxiety effects and you don't.  One of the most common effects people write about is ""arthritis"", or at least some sort of joint pain, that happens after even small exposures to nightshade and can last for a couple weeks (thankfully not me!).

&gt; I think I read somewhere that Europeans thought tomatoes were poisonous for a good while before they started eating them?

Nomato (a company that makes a line of nightshade-free faux tomato products -- pasta sauce, ketchup, etc.) has an interesting [page about nightshade history](http://www.craigsams.com/pages/tobac.html) talks about this.  All the nightshades that grew in Europe are acutely toxic (deadly nightshade, etc.), and they could recognize that the new world imports (tomato, tomatillo, potato, peppers) were in the same family by the shape of the flowers, the leaves, etc., so they weren't just being superstitious.  And they were right: tomatoes et. al. are poisonous.  It's just that most people can break down the toxins well enough to mostly get away with eating them.

Anyway, I'm happy to increase my circle of nightshade-aware friends.  I dream of figuring out some sort of diagnostic that would help people predict whether they have these issues and would likely benefit from nightshade/cholinesterase inhibitor avoidance without having to stumble into it like we did.

,"Gun collector/benchrest shooter here.

First, this is a conflict not so much between liberals and conservatives, but between urban and rural voters.

Urbanies only think about guns when someone gets killed, so they are naturally apprehensive about them, and tend to back - or at least not object to - more regulations. Rural voters use guns as tools in their daily lives. Of course, sometimes people get killed, but sometimes they get killed by knives, too. We don't ban tools because people misuse them, right?

Now, urban voters are typically liberal, and rural voters are usually conservative. So, ""cum hoc ergo propter hoc"".

Most European countries - and vast majority of European countries are much much much more liberal than US - allow for gun ownership. For example, in Switzerland males keep their army-issued - automatic weapons - at home. A lot of highly revered weapons and component manufacturers - Lapua, Tikka, Anzhutz are European, and target European customers. In Canada the guns are registered, and handguns are severely restricted, but higher percentage of population owns guns, and guns are generally cheaper, especially military imports (e.g. you can buy an SVT there for ~$400, whereas the price in the US is around $800, SKS can be had for $200 in CA, &gt; $300 in the US). Yes, there is more gun regulations, but should people who do not know how to handle a gun really own one?

Second, SA itself. It reads as follows:

""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

When it was written, it had 2 meanings. First, the Militia was required for protecting the US against the foreign invasion. Early Americans treated Army with a very healthy dose of contempt, because they were afraid that a popular military leader might stage a coup. Many founders were against creating a Navy. Second, the Militia was needed to guard against a tyrannical government, should a coup be staged.

In either case, the intent of SA was to ensure that a fighting force capable of protecting the people of the US against a government, foreign or domestic.

Back in late 18th century, small arms were enough for this purpose, but these days no one could legitimately claim that a bunch of AR-15s would match weapons available to a typical military - fighter planes, bombers, tanks, armoured personnel carriers, ships, submarines, and nuclear weapons.

So if we are arguing that the laws that regulate the gun ownership are drawn from SA, then following the intent of the law we should allow for private ownership of serious military hardware, including the nukes.

,"The war wasn't originally about slavery. Lincoln made it a war about slavery to keep Britain from aiding the South and to garner more general support from Europe, as well as reaffirm the votes of the abolitionists, which was quite a wise move on his part.

Southern states felt they had the right to leave the union if they didn't like it, assuming that a state was like a mini-nation. The northern states said that statehood was binding and that they couldn't leave, as the constitution mandates to ""form a more perfect union"" in the Preamble. Both sides are understandable.

They never expected victory, because they knew total victory was unreasonable. They knew then best they could do was draw and earn independence; they never expected the Union to surrender.

&gt; *""Only by playing with data can scientists come up with the infamous ‘hockey stick’ graph of global warming""
By Ross McKitrick*

http://www.uoguelph.ca/~rmckitri/research/papers.html

&gt;Beginning in 2003, I worked with Stephen McIntyre to replicate a famous result in paleoclimatology known as the Hockey Stick graph. Developed by a U.S. climatologist named Michael Mann, it was a statistical compilation of tree ring data supposedly proving that air temperatures had been stable for 900 years, then soared off the charts in the 20th century. Prior to the publication of the Hockey Stick, scientists had held that the medieval-era was warmer than the present, making the scale of 20th century global warming seem relatively unimportant. The dramatic revision to this view occasioned by the Hockey Stick’s publication made it the poster child of the global warming movement. It was featured prominently in a 2001 report of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), as well as government websites and countless review reports. Steve and I showed that the mathematics behind the Mann Hockey Stick were badly flawed, such that its shape was determined by suspect bristlecone tree ring data. Controversies quickly piled up: Two expert panels involving the U.S. National Academy of Sciences were asked to investigate, the U.S. Congress held a hearing, and the media followed the story around the world.  The expert reports upheld all of our criticisms of the Mann Hockey Stick, both of the mathematics and of its reliance on flawed bristlecone pine data. One of the panels, however, argued that while the Mann Hockey Stick itself was flawed, a series of other studies published since 1998 had similar shapes, thus providing support for the view that the late 20th century is unusually warm. The IPCC also made this argument in its 2007 report. But the second expert panel, led by statistician Edward Wegman, pointed out that the other studies are not independent. They are written by the same small circle of authors, only the names are in different orders, and they reuse the same few data climate proxy series over and over. Most of the proxy data does not show anything unusual about the 20th century. But two data series have reappeared over and over that do have a hockey stick shape. One was the flawed bristlecone data that the National Academy of Sciences panel said should not be used, so the studies using it can be set aside. The second was a tree ring curve from the Yamal Peninsula in Siberia, compiled by UK scientist Keith Briffa.  Briffa had published a paper in 1995 claiming that the medieval period actually contained the coldest year of the millennium. But this claim depended on just three tree ring records (called cores) from the Polar Urals. Later, a colleague of his named F. H. Schweingruber produced a much larger sample from the Polar Urals, but it told a very different story: The medieval era was actually quite warm and the late 20th century was unexceptional. Briffa and Schweingruber never published those data, instead they dropped the Polar Urals altogether from their climate reconstruction papers.  In its place they used a new series that Briffa had calculated from tree ring data from the nearby Yamal Peninsula that had a pronounced Hockey Stick shape: relatively flat for 900 years then sharply rising in the 20th century. This Yamal series was a composite of an undisclosed number of individual tree cores. In order to check the steps involved in producing the composite, it would be necessary to have the individual tree ring measurements themselves. But Briffa didn’t release his raw data. Over the next nine years, at least one paper per year appeared in prominent journals using Briffa’s Yamal composite to support a hockey stick-like result. The IPCC relied on these studies to defend the Hockey Stick view, and since it had appointed Briffa himself to be the IPCC Lead Author for this topic, there was no chance it would question the Yamal data.  Despite the fact that these papers appeared in top journals like Nature and Science, none of the journal reviewers or editors ever required Briffa to release his Yamal data. Steve McIntyre’s repeated requests for them to uphold their own data disclosure rules were ignored. Then in 2008 Briffa, Schweingruber and some colleagues published a paper using the Yamal series (again) in a journal called the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, which has very strict data-sharing rules. Steve sent in his customary request for the data, and this time an editor stepped up to the plate, ordering the authors to release their data. A short while ago the data appeared on the Internet. Steve could finally begin to unpack the Yamal composite. It turns out that many of the samples were taken from dead (partially fossilized) trees and they have no particular trend. The sharp uptrend in the late 20th century came from cores of 10 living trees alive as of 1990, and five living trees alive as of 1995. Based on scientific standards, this is too small a sample on which to produce a publication-grade proxy composite. The 18th and 19th century portion of the sample, for instance, contains at least 30 trees per year. But that portion doesn’t show a warming spike. The only segment that does is the late 20th century, where the sample size collapses. Once again a dramatic hockey stick shape turns out to depend on the least reliable portion of a dataset.   But an even more disquieting discovery soon came to light. Steve searched a paleoclimate data archive to see if there were other tree ring cores from at or near the Yamal site that could have been used to increase the sample size. He quickly found a large set of 34 up-to-date core samples, taken from living trees in Yamal by none other than Schweingruber himself! Had these been added to Briffa’s small group the 20th century would simply be flat. It would appear completely unexceptional compared to the rest of the millennium.  Combining data from different samples would not have been an unusual step. Briffa added data from another Schweingruber site to a different composite, from the Taimyr Peninsula. The additional data were gathered more than 400 km away from the primary site. And in that case the primary site had three or four times as many cores to begin with as the Yamal site. Why did he not fill out the Yamal data with the readily-available data from his own coauthor? Why did Briffa seek out additional data for the already well-represented Taimyr site and not for the inadequate Yamal site? Thus the key ingredient in most of the studies that have been invoked to support the Hockey Stick, namely the Briffa Yamal series, depends on the influence of a woefully thin subsample of trees and the exclusion of readily-available data for the same area. Whatever is going on here, it is not science.  I have been probing the arguments for global warming for well over a decade. In collaboration with a lot of excellent coauthors I have consistently found that when the layers get peeled back, what lies at the core is either flawed, misleading or simply non-existent. The surface temperature data is a contaminated mess with a significant warm bias, and as I have detailed elsewhere the IPCC fabricated evidence in its 2007 report to cover up the problem. Climate models are in gross disagreement with observations, and the discrepancy is growing with each passing year. The often-hyped claim that the modern climate has departed from natural variability depended on flawed statistical methods and low-quality data. The IPCC review process, of which I was a member last time, is nothing at all like what the public has been told: Conflicts of interest are endemic, critical evidence is systematically ignored and there are no effective checks and balances against bias or distortion.  I get exasperated with fellow academics, and others who ought to know better, who pile on to the supposed global warming consensus without bothering to investigate any of the glaring scientific discrepancies and procedural flaws. Over the coming few years, as the costs of global warming policies mount and the evidence of a crisis continues to collapse, perhaps it will become socially permissible for people to start thinking for themselves again. In the meantime I am grateful for those few independent thinkers, like Steve McIntyre, who continue to ask the right questions and insist on scientific standards of openness and transparency.

,"1.)  What do you want to do when you get there and for how long?

This means MOS and life after the military.  Think about what you like to do.  Like computers?  Signal.  Like building stuff or blowing it up?  Engineers.  Fixing stuff?  Depends on what you like fix, there are vehicle mechanics, jet mechanics, helicopter mechanics, electronic repairmen, radar repairmen.  There are cooks, reporters, clerks, language specialists, chaplain assistants, x-ray techs, cops, cartoonists, writers, etc.  There are TONS of different jobs.  Pick the one you think you would enjoy the most.  If you don't mind not showering for days or weeks, like the rush of getting shot at and in fist fights to the death...then its combat arms for you baby!

If you aren't planning on it being a career, go for a technical job where you can get some experience that you can translate to a job on the outside.  Not a lot of job demand for artillery specialists in the civilian world.

2.)  How much macho bullshit can you stand?

Lots of guys eventually get sick of locker room bullshit.  Eventually cursing, spitting, fighting, and drinking get old.  Combat arms like infantry, armor, artillery are famous for their meat-heads.  Every day will be like being on a football team with ""prove how hooah you are.""  If that's not you, then go with a non-combat arm.  Though in the Army and Marines you will still get it to some degree no matter where you go.  Navy isn't as big on macho bullshit, but you do need to be tough.  Think of it like being a steel mill worker, or auto plant employee; blue collar, cold beer, and the Pittsburgh Steelers.  Air Force does have its military side, but its more like Starfleet than Klingon if you catch my drift.  Air Force is sort of like a James Bond villain.  They would rather fuck you up with their smarts than their fists, but will if they have to.

3)  Oh the places you will go.

Have a wife and kids?  Well with the current deployment rates, in the Army and Marines you will maybe see them 2 years out of a 4 year enlistment.  Navy you are gone about 6 months to a year at a time if you are with the fleet.  Air force rotations are usually shorter depending on the MOS.  This WILL NOT CHANGE for the foreseeable future.

Stateside bases....
A large number of military bases are on land even the Native Americans said, ""Fuck you, no."" to.  Air Forces bases can be literally in the middle of a wheat field in Nebraska with nothing for 80 miles in any direction.
Army and Marine bases don't come with places nicknamed ""Camp Swampy"" ""The Hood."" ""Lost in the Woods"" for nothing.  Hope you don't want to go New York or L.A. style clubbing because it really won't happen unless you don't mind driving about 2 hours or so.  Navy Bases, when you aren't living on the boat itself, are hit or miss.  Its where you get shore leave that counts.
If you get stationed in Europe you lucked out.  Many an American living in Germany is an ex-soldier that never wanted to leave.  The Pacific outside of Hawaii can be cool, just wear a raincoat and watch your wallet.  Korea?  Yeah it can be awesome, but at any point that midget could decide to go Napoleon on you.

4.)  Why are you joining?
No jobs back home?  Any branch will do.
Discipline?  Marines baby.
Hi-tech training?  Navy or Air Force...you can walk in off the street and if you are smart enough within two years you are running a nuclear reactor.
See the world?  Navy...though they don't tell you most of the world is ocean.
Kill something?  Army or Marines.

5.) Who are you?
This is the great abstract.  Sure you will learn a lot about yourself joining the service so the ads don't lie there, but you have to have an idea before you get there.  Do you know when to keep your mouth shut?  Thats rule #1 of any branch of service; swallowing your pride and your ego.  How tolerant are you?  You will meet people that you would never normally meet.  In the same rank in formation you will stand next to a Muslim, a New Yorker (you'll learn they are a special breed), a former street thug, a bible thumper, a closeted homosexual, a sexist Guido type, a homophobe, a militant atheist, a drunk, someone who reads Russian literature and listens to Mozart, a rich kid with something to prove to dad, and someone who lives in their barracks room and plays WoW all night...  Can you get along with all of them when the time comes?  How much stress can you handle?  What are you afraid of...not like spiders or heights...but like failure, death, disappointing someone?  What happens when you can't handle stress?  Can you keep yourself out of trouble?  There is a lot of temptation out there for a soldier with a full wallet, a sex drive, and a bottle of booze.

Well then, I reiterate in more precise language:  If you dislike American Constitutionalism and its Second Amendment (which was recently reaffirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States), then go back to the UK where the laws are more to your liking.  Nobody but you is making you stay here.

&gt; I don't think that guns are a uniquely American thing. The warlords in Africa are quite fond of guns too.

Ah, I see... very backhandedly saying that Americans' rights to have guns makes them equivalent to African warlords.  What a distorted vision.  And never mind the fact that most (on the order of 99.99%) of the ~100 million American gun owners only EVER shoot their guns for sporting purposes, and not for crime, or even for self defense.  

&gt; Our gun free society has a good sight fewer murders than yours does.

And it also has a much worse level of knife crime and bludgeoning crime as a result.  You still have gangs, and all the other problems.  Your bans have fixed nothing.

Maybe you just watch too much ""Hollywood"" or believe too much in the propaganda you learned in the UK.  Crime is only bad in a few concentrated places in the US. The rest is pretty damned safe and peaceful on the whole.  

Oh, and ironically (or is it?) the bad concentrations of crime are only in the places where guns are most restricted.  How can that be?  Well...

The Reality is that violence is not about the guns or knives, but about the societal issues surrounding the people committing the crimes.  Criminals will always find tools for their purpose, even if you keep banning everything in sight, including pub glasses (yes, I know about that (IMO) stupid ban in the UK, too).  

EDUCATION, not legislation, is the right approach to fixing society's woes and reducing crime.

&gt; Don't you think it is pathetic for the richest and most powerful nation on the planet to have higher murder rates than such poor and/or oppressed nations? 

First, poor and oppressed nations have SHITTY record-keeping. Hell, even ours is quite suspect for a myriad of reasons.

Second, there are also a number of well-armed countries with LOWER crime rates, and poorly armed ones with HIGHER crime rates. Care to explain that with anything other than the reason I gave above? 

Third, and most important, is one key thing you aren't taking into account: We horrible Americans have, for hundreds of years, been taking in pretty much EVERYONE without prejudice -- including the dregs and outcast of every other society, including your own.

It is perfectly reasonable (and ought to be expected) that because we have developed such a mixed cultural society, with such mixed financial disparity, and such mixed and contradictory value systems, that we'd have more crime than all the more homogenous cultures who cast off or otherwise drive out their unwanted dregs and non-conformists.

We remain The Land of Opportunity -- your own presence here underscores that fact; by your own admission, you get a better opportunity by living here, vs the UK.  

So don't go ""fucking it up"" for the rest of us, trying to turn the US into just another branch of the EU.  Our Constitution works holistically, not in piecemeal.  The First and Second Amendments protect each other (and the rest).  Take away the 2nd, and the whole thing falls apart.

&gt;&gt; But here in the USA, we have a constitution which permits its free citizens to own guns.

&gt; What for? So they can shoot each other? 

Again, try to stop ""watching so much Hollywood"" or believing in the propaganda.  Mmm-kay?

Also, you are really showing your ignorance of American (and British!) history here.  That, or else your arrogance...

""What for"" is first-and-foremost so that we can resist an oppressive government, like the one we cast off some 235 years ago. Maybe you've head of them.

And it's also so that ALL of us, including the ""peasants"", can protect and preserve their ""Right to Life"" (as well as Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness) from the criminals who DO NOT give a flying fig about the laws which say it's illegal to harm or steal from others, as well as the ones saying they cannot have guns because they are convicted felons or mentally unstable.

I know that brits prefer to just keep a stiff upper lip while being beaten to death in their own homes, but most Americans rather enjoy their Civil Right to self defense, especially in their own homes.

&gt; You don't need a gun if no one else has a gun.

Really?  So using an extreme, but also VERY real-life, recent case to illustrate just how wrong you are: 

Are you really saying that a 90 year old, frail grandmother doesn't need a gun to protect herself from a couple of burly, healthy 20 years old who break into her home and threaten her?  Whether or not they have guns (which they probably would still acquire, even after a ban) or knives (ditto), and even with just their superior physical condition, she's pretty much doomed without that which Americans have long called ""the great equalizer"" (for good reason).

So in summary...

Please, just try letting go of that bullshit you were raised to believe (e.g. including the idea that people have no right to self defense, and that guns are the source of societal woes) and try examining the *other facts* of the matter -- the ones which you've put so much energy into ignoring and protesting.  

Failing some level of mature acceptance of the fact that you have *chosen* to live in a society with a right to bear arms, and if you just find America to be so damned ""warlord-like"" and unsafe to live in, then I again suggest that you retreat to the (apparently fantastically great) safety of ""home in the UK"" -- and stop sucking on the teat of our disdainful ""opportunity"" and constitutionalism.

,"How about you learning a thing of two about Camp David and the follow on talks at Taba? 

How about whating a PBS doc [**shattered dreams of peace **](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oslo/negotiations/) An American program which bends backwards to pain Israel in a positive light.
 
*In a desperate attempt to salvage the peace effort before Israel's  election (hard-liner Ariel Sharon was forecast to defeat Barak) negotiators met in the Egyptian resort of Taba, focusing on new parameters for an agreement which had been developed by Clinton the previous month. The new terms went further than what Israel and the U.S. had offered at Camp David.*

*In contrast to Camp David, the Palestinians this time made counter-offers. After a week of off-and-on negotiations, senior Palestinian and Israeli negotiators announced they had never been more close to reaching agreement on final-status issues. But they had run out of political time. They couldn't conclude an agreement with Clinton now out of office and Barak standing for reelection in two weeks. ""We made progress, substantial progress. We are closer than ever to the possibility of striking a final deal,"" said Shlomo Ben-Ami, Israel's negotiator. Saeb Erekat, Palestinian chief negotiator, said, ""My heart aches because I know we were so close. We need six more weeks to conclude the drafting of the agreement.""*


Bit different to popular Israel accounts isnt it? 

I remember it. With two weeks to go in an Israeli election, Barak was tanking in the polls with leaks of his negotiation with the Palestinians and Sharon stomping around demanding the negotiations end..

so that's what happened. Barak broke off and said he would resume post the election.  Arafat appealed in Israeli TV that he return to the table, he didn't.

Post the election Barak went further, and wrote [**this**](http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2001/2/Barak%20to%20Bush-%20Sharon%20is%20not%20bound%20by%20negotiating) to the new president of the US.

*Prime Minister and Defense Minister Ehud Barak clarified this evening that the ideas which were brought up in the course of the recent negotiations conducted with the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority, including those raised at the Camp David Summit and by President Clinton towards the end of his term in office, are not binding on the new government to be formed in Israel. In a letter to President George Bush, Prime Minister Barak stated that his government had done the utmost to bring about an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but that these efforts did not bear fruit, primarily because of a lack of sufficient readiness for compromise on the part of the Palestinian leadership...Before sending the letter, Barak spoke with former President Clinton, and they were in agreement that the ideas raised in the past months are not binding on the new government in Israel. Prime Minister Barak intends to convey this position also to the heads of the European Union and to Chairman Arafat.*

Sorry to rain on your parade. But at least now you know.

,"&gt; Errr, no you don't... You do know what Germanic means?

Right, my bad.

&gt; I'm confused why half-assed guesswork is supposed to be somehow a good thing. I want to know a language properly. I don't want to imbue some bizarre hybrid languages into my brain.

Recognizing words, structures and being able to apply knowledge is fundamental to creating any fluent language. The language studies in Finland are fundamentally flawed, where someone at some point thought that people learn a language by repeating grammatical rules over and over again, when in fact you just need to speak, learn to listen and just make due with what you have. Kind of like starting out with a raft and and building a ship as you sail along. Instead, Finns are taught to not even set sail until you have built a proverbial luxury yacht, so nobody even dares to speak a word until you think you've learned everything there is to know about the language.

&gt; We have mandatory 6 year Swedish because 4.5% of the continental population speaks Swedish. Think about it. It wasn't mandatory before some political deals in the early 70's. You cannot get a university/college degree in Finland without subjecting yourself to some bullshit 2 credit Swedish course and passing it. This only applies if you received your comprehensive school education in Finnish. If you received it in Swedish you have to take a BS Finnish course. If you received your school education in Swahili, you're exempt from Swedish and Finnish at the university level. It's a nutty world of language politics.

Yeah, and Swedish-speakers are taught Finnish from second grade. So what? It comes with the territory in a country where the bilingual status is in the constitution. The 4,5% argument you pose is an argument best left out, as domestic languages should always be protected. Otherwise we might see the exact same argument in about a hundred years when the relevance of the prevalence of the Finnish language is discussed in the European Union. I did the 2 credit university course by just showing up, writing an essay and doing a verbal test, didn't even take me 2 hours of my life and it gave me something on paper that show's that I have at least basic knowledge of the second domestic language. Also, regarding Swahili, you're not exempt if you're a Finnish national, you're only exempt if you're in a college/grad school exchange program.",1278320264,c0tjisv,False,,Jojje22,1426367290,0,t5_2qh13,0,True,1,0,t1_c0tjisv,False,t1_c0tjg6i,1,t3_clsei,,worldnews

All the people in leading (tell somebody what to think and what to do) position are not drawing their conclusion based on investigating the facts. They let themself told by stakeholders what to do. And that applies to anybody from teachers to the chairman of FED.

The communication principle, that truth does not exists, there are only opinions, is the base of our modern media and politics. 

The polemic about creation and evolution is not about the truth. It is about, how the public opinion is directed. If the magic word for some people is God, the PR uses this.

,"Hmmm - The Braided Path series (starting with The Weavers Of Saramyr) by Chris Wooding are most influenced by Chinese culture (as well as Japanese and Persian).  There's a definite Shinto feel to the religion and beliefs of the main culture.   

Gene Wolf's Latro in the Mist combines Greek mythology with Egyptian and Persian as the central character (a Roman mercenary who fought for Xerxes at the Battle of Plataea) travels.  Although when the stories start, they are embedded in Greek mythology, it doesn't feel like a European based fantasy.  This is partly because the hero suffers from recurrent amnesia which keeps everything alien.  As the books continue they stray further from European myth.

Jonathan Carroll's books are usually set now and in western society, but make little use of mythology - except in broad concepts such as the idea of a single god (not necessarily Judaeo–Christian though).  His first novel The Land of Laughs concerns a school teacher who attempts research a children's author he loved as a child - the teacher slowly gets drawn into a town that appears to have been magically created or influenced by the author.

,"Some weeks ago another american asked me a question regarding traveling in Germany. Here is what I wrote, maybe it is useful for you too:

You can travel by Bus, Car, Train or Plane. It depends on distance etc. which alternative is the best and cheapest. I'll try to give you a short but comprehensive overview.

**Plane** For long distances this is the cheapest way to travel (except you can get a ride -&gt; see cars), even if you are traveling inside Germany. For instance if you want to travel to Berlin, you should first check if there are some cheap flights. You can get flights from Germany to nearly every European country starting with 30-50 Euros. Stuttgart is the next airport to Tübingen: http://www.flughafen-stuttgart.de (English available)

**Car** There are a lot of agencies for arranging rides called Mitfahrzentrale or Mitfahrgelegenheit (short: ""mfg""). Usuly in towns with universities like Stuttgart or Tübingen there are a lot of students who drive home during weekends.

Tübingen / Stuttgart -&gt; Berlin 30-40 Euros Tübingen / Stuttgart -&gt; Bonn maybe 20-30 Euros

It's cheap and safe, but you rely on the tenacity of the driver (punctuality...). I never had a bad experience except some traffic jam.

Some links: http://www.mitfahrgelegenheit.de http://www.mitfahrzentrale.de

**Train / Bus** For short distances this is probably the best and cheapest and way to travel. There are so called ""Verkehrsverbünde"" (Verkehrsverbund, transport association). Inside a transport association traveling is very cheap and you can buy day or monthly tickets. You can travel a whole month by train or bus inside this area if you buy such a ticket.

If you drive through more transport association areas it is a little bit more expensive. E.g. Tuebingen -&gt; Stuttgart: 1 hour, 11,50€ (one way)

Traveling long distances by train is expensive. Tübingen -&gt; Bonn, ~4hours, 70-110 Euros (long distance trains); with local trains: 8h, 50-60 Euros

But there are many(!!) possibilities to get a discount. Here are some:

   1. You can buy a Bahncard 50 or 25. For one year you get a 50% or 25% discount on all train tickets. (For students a Bahncard 50 costs round about 120 Euro). But be careful, it is a subscription and you need to cancel it 3(?) Months before your Bahncard expires otherwise you have to buy it for another year.

   2. You can get a discount (25-50%) if you buy a round-trip ticket some days / weeks before your trip. But it is only valid for trains you booked.

   3. Ländertickets. (regional day tickets) Valid inside one federal state for up to 5 people, only local trains, starting with 26€.
   
   4. Schönes-Wochenende-Ticket. Valid for up to 5 persons, for one Saturday or Sunday, traveling inside Germany with local trains, 37 Euros.

   5. Sometimes there are special offers if you want to travel to a big city in Europe.

Kinds of trains: local trains: Regionalbahn (RB), Regionalexpress (RE), InterRegioExpress (IRE; fastest local train) long-distance trains: InterCity (IC), EuroCity (EC), InterCityExpress (ICE; fast, but expensive)

It is cheaper to buy tickets online or at a ticket machine than in a ticket office.

,"&gt;Hip hooray, common sense, anyone? Should we still be in awe of this magnanimous gesture?

It isn't common sense if you would compare it to South America, East Asia or Australia.

It's not about entitlement or anything else, but about understanding why the country is where it is today. These people were of course the same people as everybody else in the country, just as Swedish speaking Finns are today, but they were educated and in extension influential in Europe and Russia specifically because they spoke Swedish. If they hadn't, someone else would have been in their place, and our country would have been different. The day Finland would lose her bilingual status is the day a big part of the Finnish cultural identity vanishes. It would be something we had, but don't care to cultivate anymore.

Swedish speakers are very well aware of their position as a minority, and they demand their culture to live on, just as Finnish speakers will in the EU. The pride and protection of the culture isn't hard to understand either. They evidently can't rely on the majority to protect the culture, as the majority want it to more or less go away. The majority fails to understand how important people's own language is, and somehow thinks that the minority is holding on to principles just to fuck with them. Tyranny of the majority... you mean the tyranny is needed because the minority demands their culture to be left alive?

I'm not much for national identities myself, I don't feel I have one. But I do recognize that a lot of people need it, and that a big part of a community and the sense of heritage is connected to the language that they speak, and it would be a tragedy to remove it from someone. Removing the possibility to get service and help in their own language is strangling this part of the identity, and I don't feel the majority has the right to do this, especially when it's a given part of the majority's heritage too.

,"From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmed_salmon#Pollution_and_toxins):

&gt;Pollution and toxins
Salmon farms are typically sited in pristine marine ecosystems which they then pollute. A farm with 200,000 salmon discharges more faecal waste than a city of 60,000 people.[citation needed] This waste is discharged directly into the surrounding aquatic environment, untreated, often containing antibiotics and pesticides.""[5] There is also an accumulation of heavy metals on the benthos (seafloor) near the salmon farms, particularly copper and zinc.[6]
Toxins are also found in the flesh of farmed salmon.[17] A 2004 study, reported in Science, analysed farmed and wild salmon for organochlorine contaminants. They found the contaminants were higher in farmed salmon. Within the farmed salmon, European (particularly Scottish) salmon had the highest levels, and Chilean salmon the lowest.[18] A follow up study confirmed this, and found levels of dioxins, chlorinated pesticides, PCBs and other toxins up to ten times greater in farmed salmon than wild Pacific salmon.[19] On a positive note, further research using the same fish samples used in the previous study, showed that farmed salmon contained levels of beneficial fatty acids that were two to three times higher than wild salmon.[20] A follow up benefit-risk analysis on salmon consumption balanced the cancer risks with the (n-3) fatty acid advantages of salmon consumption. They found that recommended levels of (n-3) fatty acid consumption can be achieved eating farmed salmon with acceptable carcinogenic risks, but recommended levels of EPA+DHA intake cannot be achieved solely from farmed (or wild) salmon without unacceptable carcinogenic risks.[21] The conclusions were that

,"*le sigh*. Ok, let us get into this. First, I should clarify that the debate ""Was America founded as a Christian nation,"" is actually comprised of 2 separate points. The first ""Was America founded with the expectation of it being a nation devoted to Christian values and championing Christian causes"" is the oft-discussed topic. But there is a second, more important, question that is imbedded in the debate by the Christian right, and it often escapes our notice: ""*Should we consider America a strictly Christian nation, even if that was the framers' intent?*"" To the first question I say no. To the second I say definitively NO. Christian legal codification had its time, and that time was called the Dark and Middle ages. It ended with the 30-Years War and I feel that is all that needs to be said on that matter. I will leave the second question in this debate for you to argue at your own discretion and I will focus on the first point: **""Was America founded with the expectation of it being a nation devoted to Christian values and championing Christian causes""?**

First, don't over-extend yourself in your claims. 

&gt;Exact interpretations of deism vary, but are definitely arguable for... George Washington...

Washington seemed either A) a religious man of some degree who kept his religion respectfully in the private sphere, or B) a man for whom we know little of his faith. Ultimately, I think he left little evidence to support the claim that he was a deist in the Jeffersonian sense, aside that he was receptive to Jefferson's and Madison's advice about the necessity to separate church and state for the sake of both institutions. This point, I think, has more to do with Washington's personal knowledge of the history of political philosophy than an ambivalence about his own Christianity. (The two books he kept on his nightstand were the Bible and Addison's *Cato*.) So tread lightly on the Washington issue.

Next, try to attack the biggest claim he makes, which is actually two claims:

&gt;A) Yes, the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence are documents based on the tenets of the Bible by individuals who practiced Christianity. B) It was clearly a part of their life experience.

Claim A is demonstrably false. The Constitution codifies almost no specific aspects of biblical law, and none beyond those codes that are uniform among almost all modern religions and states. The sources you need for this are 1) a copy of the Constitution and 2) a copy of the bible. Conceptually, the declaration is based largely on the works of Locke and his secular philosophical predecessors. Aquinas and Augustine had little to do with it.

Now lets take a step back. What *is* true is that many founders believed that morality was not possible *without* a specific belief in a deity who imposed moral law upon humanity. Locke himself shared this view. (This is understandable, as they lacked today's knowledge of evolved morality and neuro-biology.) However, all that seemed to be required of the citizenry to fulfill this need was a mere belief in the objective moral codes set in place by a God at the beginning. This is, at its core, a deist proposition (and obviously NOT the same as atheism! Try to clear that one up). Cite Washington's letter to the Newport Jews, specifically the 

&gt;the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, *requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens in giving it on all occasions their effectual support.*

Which he later expands to include all Abraham religions. Specific Christian beliefs systems were obviously NOT the critical point. What's more, Jefferson displayed his beliefs along similar lines, particularly with regards to the Jefferson bible. 

Claim B, his second claim:

&gt;[Christianity] was clearly a part of their life experience.

Is both true and irrelevant. Christianity was ubiquitous in the lives of Western Europeans and Americans, especially among political leaders who needed to consider popular reception to their political propositions. Slavery and subjugation of women were *also* both also parts of their life experience. The question is: to what degree did their private beliefs influence the founding documents. I think, upon a simple evaluation of the primary source material, you see naught but the most tangential connections between Christian theology and the Constitution. **Try and bring the argument back to this point. Ask, and be persistent, that he provide evidence beyond the fact that religion was present in the lives of the founders. Ask for the proof where the founders state that specific structural components of the Constitution and Declaration (and not just superficial language) was directly influenced by the Christian bible.** Christian founders seem to tiptoe around this point or provide shoddy evidence that has been shot down in the past.

Now if you like, I can bring up some specifically false claims that he made in his final response to you, but I think this is a bad idea on two counts. 1) if you engage him in the messy details, you will have to devote far too much of your valuable time in researching and debunking baseless claim after baseless claim that religious-founder proponents have had decades to accrue. It's tiring. 2) This whole thing ultimately comes back to the imperative claim made above: the concrete evidence that specific structural components of the Constitution and Declaration (and not just superficial language) was directly influenced by the Christian bible. THIS is where the debate resides and where you cannot waiver from. If you are to refute claims, only do so for those claims that directly address *this* point!

That being said, there is literally NOTHING said in the last paragraph that supports the above claim. The final third appears to be an attempt to convert you or something, so be wary.

Some complain that its enervating to play the missions alone but there is a build in and automatic LFF system.

Some complain about lag but i never experienced lag (on the EU servers). Some complain about the graphics... well thats a matter of taste anyways.

,"You could try doing some research on [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed).  It's a search engine for papers on medical research.  If you want to get the papers themselves you may need to sign up for a course at a local college that has a med program.  Just check and see if it gives you journal access and that they carry the ones you want.  If they have a hard copy you may be able to just show up at their library.

If [prednisone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prednisone) works it's likely an immune issue.   Start going through the list of diseases that it's used to treat.  Look for symptoms that match and tests that can rule out those diseases.  Keep in mind rashes are common to a lot of immune diseases. 

You can also check with blood relatives to see if there is anything that runs in your family.  It may give you some place to start.  

If you come up with something present it to a doctor and ask if they can check for it.  If it comes back negative ask them what the false negative rate is, and why this test rules it out.  It'll make them think about it.   Keep an open mind, the doctors have more experience and focused education, but they should be able to explain their reasoning.  Don't be too overbearing about presenting things and challenging, I know that's hard with your son at risk, but it's important.  Doctors are people too and have all the same failings.

,"&gt; The US differs in this from most other Western countries then.

No. Nearly all European countries are bound by the European Court of Human Rights. They have even ruled that the government must protect the demonstrators from their opponents.

*A demonstration may annoy or give offence to persons opposed to the ideas or claims that it is seeking to promote. The participants must, however, be able to hold the demonstration without having to fear that they will be subjected to physical violence by their opponents; such a fear would be liable to deter associations or other groups supporting common ideas or interests from openly expressing their opinions on highly controversial issues affecting the community. In a democracy the right to counter-demonstrate cannot extend to inhibiting the exercise of the right to demonstrate.*

*Genuine, effective freedom of peaceful assembly cannot, therefore, be reduced to a mere duty on the part of the State not to interfere: a purely negative conception would not be compatible with the object and purpose of Article 11 (art. 11). Like Article 8 (art. 8), Article 11 (art. 11) sometimes requires positive measures to be taken, even in the sphere of relations between individuals, if need be (see, mutatis mutandis, the X and Y v. the Netherlands judgment of 26 March 1985, Series A no. 91, p. 11, § 23).*

&gt; But as I understand it there are still laws in place which requires registering a demonstration etc.

Yes, these are common, but cannot significantly hinder the right to peacefully assemble.

I studied Political Science, but be aware that this is certainly not a must. You can come from really anywhere, and still have a shot working for the UN. However, PoliSci, or anything related, certainly gives you a very good preparation for what to expect out here.

The UN lifestyle is of course a little wild, and you definitely have to be able and be open-minded of traveling (often), learning new languages, and being exposed to other cultures. Personally, I do not have my own family yet (no GF either), so I am free to move around as I desire. 

I plan on doing so until my early - mid thirties, when I eventually will try to settle down. Do not worry too much: Some limit their travels, e.g. moving around only every few years, and others are able to settle in one of the UNs main headquarters, e.g. in NYC or Geneva. I like that idea, having traveled and witnessed the world, thus gained plenty of work field experience, and subsequently being able to use this acquired knowledge for the purpose of a more theoretical management position somewhere in West Europe / USA.

Also, I do want to get into diplomacy/conflict resolution further in my career; a background in development, e.g. in post-conflict countries such as Kosovo is, will certainly help.

*EDIT2*: Again, on another note (hey, you got me thinking!) regarding the 'impossible lifestyle'. My response regarding the family you saw above; what I personally found, and still do, find challenging is your relation with other people. As I quickly make new friends (and have to, as I move a lot), I have noticed that I also quickly forget about them again. A certain detachment is indeed necessary to live this job - if you are bound to your circle of friends from high school, visit grandma every Sunday, and have family dinners at 7 PM, then this job is not for you. This 'detachment' has good and bad sides; again, obviously, I get to see a lot of this world, though on the bad side, I have certainly made more acquaintances than *friends*. That is something to consider and one has to live with - In order to stay happy, it took me a while to be aware of this 'problem', and rather turn it into something positive. Being engaged with so many cultures, I constantly see myself growing and able to develop my personality - Something *friends* will, in the end, appreciate, even if they do not get to see me too often ;)",1278345411,c0tk0ff,True,,more_than_that,1426367519,0,t5_2qzb6,0,True,2,0,t1_c0tk0ff,False,t1_c0tjz2h,2,t3_cm4qm,,IAmA

So yeah, I can't even list them all, much less play them. As long as it was on sale and it didn't seem to suck *excessively*, I got it. About 400 games in all, over $2,000 (but think of all the money I saved!).

Maybe on the topic of gun control, but in the political realm, all I hear is how America needs to model itself after European nations (more socialist). I absolutely cannot support that because of how different our cultural ideals are, and how much more diverse our populations are. 

If liberals really wanted more socialist ideas to work, they would give the federal government less power (instead of wanting to enact all sorts of laws on the federal level), model ourselves after the EU, with the states acting as European countries -- with more autonomy. Then grassroots campaigns can begin to change how the state gov't approaches things. Which is actually the same goal that I, a conservative, am working towards.

,"Translated to PT-BR:

Você estava a caminho de casa quando você morreu.


Foi um acidente de carro. Nada particularmente memorável, mas fatal de qualquer forma. Você deixou uma esposa e dois filhos. Foi uma morte sem dor. O resgate tentou o melhor pra te salvar, mas sem sucesso. Seu corpo estava tão completamente quebrado que foi melhor assim, confie em mim.


E foi ai que você me conheceu.


""O que... o que aconteceu?"" você me perguntou. ""Onde estou?""


""Você morreu."" eu disse, de prontidão. Sem medir as palavras.


""Havia um... um caminhão e eu estava derrapando descontrolado...""


""É..."" eu disse.


""Eu... eu morri?""


""Sim. Mas não se sinta mal. Todos morrem."" eu disse.


Você olhou ao redor. Não havia nada. Apenas eu e você. ""O que é este 
lugar?"" Você perguntou. ""Isso é o vida depois da morte?""


""Mais ou menos"" eu disse.


""Você é deus?"" você perguntou.


""Sim"" eu respondi. ""Eu sou deus.""


""Meus filhos... minha esposa"" você disse.


""E quanto a eles?""


""Eles ficarão bem?""


""Isso que eu gosto de ver"" eu disse. ""Você acabou de morrer e sua maior preocupação é sua família. Há uma coisa boa ai.""


Você olhou para mim com fascínio. Para você, eu não me parecia como deus. Eu apenas parecia como outro homem. Ou possivelmente uma mulher. Alguma figura com vaga autoridade, talvez. Mais uma professora de gramática que o todo-poderoso.


""Não se preocupe"" eu disse. ""Eles estarão bem. Seus filhos se lembrarão de você como perfeito em todos os sentidos. Eles não tiveram tempo de crescer e desrespeitá-lo. Sua mulher ira chorar por fora, mas estará aliviada secretamente. Para ser sincero, seu casamento estava desmoronando. Se serve de consolo, ela se sentirá muito culpada de se sentir aliviada.""


""Ah..."" você disse. ""Então, o que acontece agora? Eu vou para o paraíso ou alguma coisa do tipo?""


""Nenhum dos dois"" eu disse. ""Você vai reencarnar.""


""Ah..."" você disse. ""Então os hindus estavam certos""


""Todas as religiões estão certas na suas próprias maneiras,"" eu disse. ""caminhe comigo.""


Você me seguiu enquanto caminhávamos através do nada. ""Onde estamos indo?""


""Nenhum lugar em particular,"" eu disse. ""apenas é legal caminhar enquanto conversamos.""


""E, qual o objetivo, então?"" você perguntou? ""Quando eu renascer, estarei zerado, certo? Um bebê. Então todas minhas experiências e tudo que eu fiz nesta vida não vão importar.""


""Nem tanto!"" eu disse. ""Você tem por dentro todo conhecimento e experiências de todas suas vidas passadas. Você apenas não as lembra neste momento.""


Eu parei de andar e coloquei as mãos no seu ombro. ""Sua alma é mais magnífica, bonita e gigante do que você possa imaginar. Uma mente humana pode conter apenas uma pequena fração do que você realmente é. É como enfiar seu dedo em um copo de água para ver se esta quente ou fria. Você coloca uma pequena parte de você em um recipiente, e quando você tira você ganhou todas as experiências que ele tinha.""


""Você tem sido humano pelos últimos 48 anos, então você ainda não esparramou pra fora toda a suam imensa consciência. Se caminhássemos por tempo suficiente, você começaria a se lembrar de tudo. Mas não há razão para fazer isso entre cada vida.""


""Por quantas vidas eu estive reencarnando, então?""


""Ah, muitas. Muitas e muitas. E em muitas vidas diferentes."" Eu disse. ""E desta vez, você será uma lavradora chinesa em 540 d.C.""


""Espere, o que?"" você bravejou. ""Você vai me mandar de volta ao passado?""


""Bem, acho q sim, tecnicamente. O tempo, como você conhece, existe apenas no seu universo. As coisas são diferentes de onde eu venho.""


""De onde você vem?"" você perguntou.


""Ah claro,"" eu expliquei. ""Eu vim de outro lugar. Outro lugar. E existem outros como eu. Eu sei que você quer saber como é lá, mas honestamente você não entenderia.""


""Ah,"" você disse, um pouco chateado. ""Mas espere. Se eu reencarno em outros lugares no tempo, eu posso ter reencarnado em mim mesmo em algum ponto.""


""Claro. Acontece o tempo todo. E com as duas vidas tem conhecimento de sua própria existência, você nem sabe que está acontecendo.""


""Então qual o sentido de tudo isso?""


""Sério?"" eu perguntei. ""Sério que você esta me perguntando o sentido da vida? Isso não lhe parece um estereótipo?""


""Bom, é uma pergunta justa."" você insistiu.


Eu te olhei nos olhos. ""O sentido da vida, a razão que eu fiz esse universo inteiro, é para você se desenvolver.""


""Você diz a humanidade? Você quer que a gente se desenvolva?""


""Não, apenas você. Eu fiz este universo inteiro pra você. Com cada nova vida você cresce e desenvolve um maior e melhor intelecto.""


""Só eu? E todas as outras pessoas?""


""Não há outras pessoas,"" eu disse. ""Neste universo, só há eu e você.""


Você olhou surpreso pra mim. ""Mas e todas as pessoas na terra...""


""Todos você. Encarnações deferentes de você.""


""Espere! Eu sou todo mundo!?""


""Agora você esta entendendo,"" eu disse, com um tapinha nas costas de congratulações.


""Eu sou todo humano que já viveu?""


""Ou que irá viver, sim"" completei.


""Sou Abraham Lincoln?""


""e você também é John Wilkes Booth (*)"" , adicionei.


""Eu sou Hitler?"" você perguntou chocado.


""E os milhões que ele matou.""


""Eu sou Jesus?""


""E você também é todos que seguiu ele.""


Você ficou em silêncio.


""Toda vez que você mal a alguém,"" eu disse, ""você estava fazendo mal a você mesmo. Toda bondade que você fez, você a você mesmo. Todo momento feliz ou triste vivido por qualquer humano, foi ou será vivido por você.""


Você pensou por um longo tempo.


""Por quê?"" você me perguntou. ""Por que tudo isso?""


""Porque algum dia, você se tornará igual a mim. Porque isso você é o que é. Você é minha criança.""


""Uau!"" você disse, incrédulo. ""Você quer dizer que eu sou um deus?""


""Não. Ainda não. Você é um feto. Você ainda esta crescendo. Quando você tiver vivido toda vida humana do inicio ao fim, por todos os tempos, ai você terá crescido o suficiente para nascer.""


""Então todo o universo,"" você disse, ""é apenas...""


""Um ovo."" eu respondi. ""Agora é hora de você seguir para sua próxima vida.""


E te mandei pelo seu caminho.

,"#2 continued.

Here is a statement by Phil Jones in 2010. When asked in an interview in the Guardian about the MWP. He surely does not make the point that the MWP was not as warm as today.

&gt;G - There is a debate over whether the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) was global or not. If it were to be conclusively shown that it was a global phenomenon, would you accept that this would undermine the premise that mean surface atmospheric temperatures during the latter part of the 20th Century were unprecedented?
There is much debate over whether the Medieval Warm Period was global in extent or not. The MWP is most clearly expressed in parts of North America, the North Atlantic and Europe and parts of Asia. For it to be global in extent the MWP would need to be seen clearly in more records from the tropical regions and the Southern Hemisphere. There are very few palaeoclimatic records for these latter two regions.
Of course, if the MWP was shown to be global in extent and as warm or warmer than today (based on an equivalent coverage over the NH and SH) then obviously the late-20th century warmth would not be unprecedented. On the other hand, if the MWP was global, but was less warm that today, then current warmth would be unprecedented.
We know from the instrumental temperature record that the two hemispheres do not always follow one another. We cannot, therefore, make the assumption that temperatures in the global average will be similar to those in the northern hemisphere.

,"* In 2008, Turkey ranked second after Russia in the list of countries with the largest number of human rights violation cases open at the European Court of Human Rights, with 9,000 cases pending as of August 2008.

* Amnesty international recently reported that Turkey is the 5th worst country in the world for torture in jails.

* For the past two hundred years, Turkey has achieved what is undoubtedly one of the worst human rights records in the world. 

* The Turks have ethnically cleansed or otherwise mistreated ethnic minorities within Turkey and the peoples of neighbouring countries. These include the Armenians, Bulgarians, Cypriots, Greeks, Kurds, Romanians and the Serbs. Turkey has the unenviable record of having conducted the first genocide of the 20th century when from 1915 to 1918 one and a half million indigenous Armenians were annihilated.

* Lately, the Turks have turned their attention to those of their own people who have the courage to speak out against human rights abuses in Turkey.  Killings, disappearances and torture of lawyers, journalists, trade unionists, intellectuals and others remain well documented and are frighteningly commonplace in modern day Turkey.

* Today, Turkey wages a dirty war against the Kurds who are fighting for recognition of their identity, and the right to express their language and culture. Almost 30,000 Kurds, government forces and civilians have been sacrificed. Three million Kurds are now refugees, and 3,000 Kurdish villages have been razed to the ground by Turkish troops.

* This policy of human rights violations and ethnic cleansing is just as evident in the occupied north of Cyprus.

* Turkey invaded the Republic of Cyprus in 1974 under the most spurious circumstances, causing death, rape, torture and forced displacement of persons, acts which are well documented by the European Court of Human Rights.

* Turkey has created an illegal apartheid regime in the occupied area forcibly separating the Greek Cypriots from the Turkish Cypriots, violating a fundamental tenet of the European Union - the principle of free movement.

There may be some relief if enough people are able to learn another way.  A lot of people are unaware of how they would be able to survive and live in reduced circumstances.  I grew up on a subsistence farm.  We traded with our neighbors for their surplus with our surplus.  We were not limited to scratching a total living from the available ground because there was an emerging post WWII economy and every year things became easier.  

The most unfortunate circumstance of a collapsed economy would be that the monied elite may attempt to continue to derive income from ground that they *own*.   Such a circumstance would hark back to the state of affairs as they existed in Europe, prior to the discovery of the Americas.  The monied elites enclosed great tracts of formerly open land and drove the subsistence in habitants into villages and towns and into a poverty that was unlike anything that could be experienced in the open and accessible subsistence of the countryside.

Yes, and imported.  According to an ATF source in [this PBS documentary](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/guns/procon/guns.html) (2 minutes of googling), however, the stereotype of stolen guns accounting for a large percentage of crimes is not true.  

From my own anecdotal experience, one of the senior managers at a client is a former national police investigator in a European country with very strict handgun laws.  His primary focus was on organized crime and weapons trafficking.  He is fairly neutral on the issue of handgun restrictions, tending towards favoring tougher gun ownership curbs, but has frequently mentioned the futility of a lot of restrictions in the face of an absolute flood of weapons entering European cities via ports.  

According to him, it simply is not possible to control the movement of illegal weapons when faced with large numbers of seaports (or airports for that matter) and comparatively open international borders; we've had several conversations on our way to and from work where he described things like his organization moving their focus away from narcotics and small-caliber weapons due to the fact that they were dealing with large Eastern European gangs moving even rocket launchers (!) through Northern Europe in considerable numbers with near impunity.  Kind of makes you think, doesn't it?

,"I think you are splitting hairs here, creating distinctions to suit a point of view - very ingeniously, of course, and also informingly; but it seems clear from what you say that the FF were in the process of withdrawing from or shedding the religious point of view while still trying to appeal to those who had retained their beliefs. It seems what you describe is a fundamentally hypocritical position: talking about divinely bestowed status and at the same time using the language of religion ""metaphorically""(ie, not literally; there isn't really a creator). Hedging their bets?
But how do religions begin? What we see here is how they can be phased out; ""bare bones belief in a creator"" is surely not a starting position but a transition from a more institutional sort of religion to something new.

Buddhism is interesting because it appears to be such a transitional state, in which some older religious belief (Hinduism?) has had its deities replaced by a human who nevertheless achieves a god-like status through reincarnation (the Dali Llama, for example). To say these are not Gods is a fine point lost on the Taliban, when they blasted the Buddhist statues at Bamiyan because they were idols.

To define religion largely on the basis of the tyrannical mind-control systems of state religion which dominated Europe at least since the days of Constantine is to miss the essential point: it is a personal conviction about how things are, shared by a group of people. Institutions and rituals, etc. follow from that, a process strikingly described in the novel 'Lord of the Flies'.

,"As I've said elsewhere, I'm actually Swiss-American, currently living in France and the Netherlands.

Gun control is a question of measure.  The U.S. has ""gun control"" -- you are required to submit to a background check, most states have some sort of limits on who can own weapons (felons, e.g.), certain kinds of weapons and accessories are outlawed, etc.  American gun control is simply far less strict than, say, German or Austrian gun control.

In Switzerland, I had to go visit the police in Zurich for a license to obtain a weapon.  The weapon must now be registered (I have some old ones that aren't, but they're antiques and, frankly, nobody's business), I must show ID to buy ammunition, I may not carry it on me unless it's unloaded and I'm on my way to/from the range, etc.  

I am familiar with most European gun laws; I am a member of the Royal Dutch shooting club, and own several firearms in Switzerland.  I argue for less restrictive gun laws in European countries as a European, not as an American.  I attempt to engage in an informed debate on the topic, which often comes in the face of ""oh, gun owners are all crazy egotistical Rambo types"" (I actually get this a lot), or ""it's just Americans trying to force their system on us"", or some variation on these.

,"Climate change is simple. If the ice caps are still melting at historic rates them climate change is still real. It really is that simple. 

Even if the globe doesn't warm and ice caps melt that is still climate change of epic proportions and poses serious threats to the long term weather conditions on earth. Cold differential and salinity are major driving points of the earth's climate. Without them the ocean currents slow and heat distribution lessens making northern climates colder and equatorial climate hotter. The result massive cold trends and crop failures in Europe and droughts seemingly endless droughts like the dust bowl through Southern America or all of American for all we know. 

The implications to rain distribution are far reaching but details are impossible to come up with until it happens. Sadly we are focused too much on global temps and too little on how weather pattern which we rely on could change dramatically specifically large scale ocean and air currents such as the Great Atlantic conveyor and the Gulf Stream. 

So until ice caps and glacier stop mass melting you know damn well climate change is continuing.

,"The Netherlands: [Amsterdam](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/cjpt0/planning_a_trip_to_amsterdam_need_tons_of_advice/) and  Den Haag, Utrecht, or Maastricht. Probably in that order. Belgium: Leuven and your choice between Brugge, Gent and/or Brussels. You could probably spend 2 days in Amsterdam, one in Den Haag/Utrecht/Maastricht, one in Leuven and one in Brugge or Gent. Rotterdam is cool, too; at least I think it is, but there aren't really any historic buildings. I'm an architecture geek, though, so I like that.

Amsterdam probably has the most to offer. 'Main' sights like the rijksmuseum, Van Gogh museum, Anne Frank House, red light district, dam square; but also [cool modern architecture](http://mimoa.eu/browse/projects/Netherlands/Amsterdam/) and other things. And yeah I just want to plug [mimoa](http://mimoa.eu/) because I think it's a really cool website that offers you lots of things to see. They even have a guide for [Amsterdam](http://mimoa.eu/city/Netherlands/Amsterdam?returnPath=/browse/projects/Netherlands/Amsterdam/). Utrecht is like mini-Amsterdam, with fewer tourists, and a large student population. Rotterdam was bombed in WWII so there are almost no historic buildings, but quite a bit of modern architecture. Den Haag is the seat of our government (but not the capital) and there is plenty to see there, too. Maastricht is the oldest city in the Netherlands and I think the atmosphere there is a bit more.. how shall I say it.. 'chique'. It's also a student town with quite a few international students. Oh by the way, if you like beer, every city has at least one café that has all the special Belgian beers. Why don't you see how many different ones you can drink on your trip?

There are basically two Netherlands-Belgium border crossings. At one you take a train from Maastricht to Luik (Liège) and/or Brussels, the other is a train that goes from Amsterdam, to Rotterdam, to Breda and then Antwerp and Brussels.

I wouldn't go to Brussels though, but if you do, go see the Grand Place and Manneken Pis. You kind of have to. Leuven, is much nicer and way more fun, especially if you love beer. The world's biggest beer brewer (InBev) is headquartered there. And it's right next to Brussels. They also have a huge student population, some very impressive old buildings, and a shitton of bars. Plus, Belgian beer is the best in the world. Other cool places in Belgium are Gent and Brugge. (Ghent and Bruges.) If you took the train from Maastricht into or past Luik, it will look like the shittiest ghetto ever, but I'm told it's actually a very nice city. They speak French there, though. And the new station, by Santiago Calatrava, is worth seeing in itself.

As for breweries, don't go to the Heineken one in Amsterdam. Other than that, they can be hard to get to. But you could try the Brand brewery near Maastricht, or maybe there are some in Belgium that are worth checking out.

,"bechus's commentary on the first two is readily verifiable in any history book, so I'll just post [the wiki article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_%E2%80%93_United_States_military_relations#Overview) on the history of aid and hope you don't fault me for using not the best source.  

For the migration, I have the initial [date as being 1881](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel#Zionism_and_the_British_Mandate).  The redddit misperception seems to be that England gave a bunch of European Jews land that belonged to somebody else or that the Jews took it themselves.  Jews immigrated there over the course of decades before 1948, buying land to live on and mostly living peacefully with the Palestinian Arabs.  The problem came in 1947 when the [UN offered to partition the territory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Partition_Plan_for_Palestine).  The Jews living there said, ""OK"" while the Arabs said, ""This deal is shitty, why do the 33% that are Jews get so much of the land when they only legally own 7%?  FAIL.""

The next impasse that I am aware of was the [Camp David Summit in 2000 under Clinton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_process_in_the_Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict#Camp_David_2000_Summit).

Look around your room right now and try to figure out how many things you don't need.  For less than $300 a year you could feed a starving child in Africa, and yet you apparently don't find it soul crushing that you're eating food and buying clothes and entertainment while some innocent child on the other side of the planet starves.  Oh no, that's not for you.  That's the responsibility of someone much wealthier than you, never mind that you are, at the least, among the wealthiest 10% in the world.  Everything, *everything* is relative.

The truth about many of those ""if I had a million dollar"" musings is that they're based on poor money management.  That's why the majority of lottery winners end up going broke - for many of them, they have no reference point for that type of wealth.  Suddenly it's free money, so much more than they ever before possessed that it's effectively endless... until it ends.  The most prudent thing to do with that million dollars would be to put it in an index fund and pretend it doesn't exist until you want to retire on it.  Again, most of the million-dollar fantasies are short-sighted and impractical.

,"&gt;Yes. THAT IS WHAT MAKES IT HARD!!! You can't escape that complexity by making stuff up.

No. It does not make it hard. It makes it the equivalent to make things up. Since you can not test again, you can start giving different reasons each time, and there is no way to test it (this is actually what keynesians do, every crisis has a different random cause).

The fact that I am pointing that you have not way to test it does not mean I dont value empirical data, I just mean that its not a definitive prove. Your arbitrary decision of ""since we can not repeat the experiment we will ignore that part and carry on"" does not makes it right.

&gt;And a priori reasoning, coupled with the rejection of empirical evidence is a complicated way of saying ""we are making stuff up""

&gt;Yes, that is done by economists, behavioral economics, parts of psychology, etc. The Austrian school does non of that. Making up Axioms without checking them in the real world with real human beings is not ""bottom up"".

I see austrian economics as a sort of psicological analisis of human action, a sociological and psicological analisis. Austrians say that humans act (that is the axiom) and from there they start analizing the actions of humans. I would call that sociological and psicological analisis. Austrian method is bottom up.

You know its funny because the economist guilty of the matematization of economics is Samuelson. Just years before the collapse of the comunist Rusia he was saying the country was a prove that planed economies can work and even thrive. Mises predicted that the comunist economies would have to close their borders to avoid their citizens scaping years before any comunist country did it, and when a big part of the european aristocracy though that comunism was the greatest system posible. How is that for fail to predict reality and correctly predicting reality?

But if you want empirical evidence (only evidence, not prove, empirical data can not prove things in social science) of Austrian economics you can read this paper: http://www.gmu.edu/depts/rae/archives/VOL14_4_2001/5_keeler.pdf . It shows what the austrian predicts happens in reality. It analises the USA economy for the last decades.

,"One major problem I have with the whole ""IQs are genetic"" argument, is while it might be true to an extent, the theory as understood on reddit and other places where pop-science is discussed supposes that populations have developed in isolation for long enough to develop genetically controlled (as opposed to environmental factors) IQ.

Thats simply not the case, unless you want to pull some extreme examples like the aborigines.

Human populations have been interbreeding across europe, asia and africa for thousands of years..sharing technology, culture and yes, genes.

,"This is too much for the classical Occidental mind, which seems to be governing the whole issue, to wrap its head around. Instead of taking these people's word on ''why they hate us'', ''the ever knowing Occidental mind'' comes up with superficial, shallow explanations -that their voters can understand: ''They hate our freedoms. They are jealous of us. They hate Lady Gaga. They want to destroy our way of life'' etc. etc. On the rare occasions that people who are labelled as anti-American/terrorists/Mooslims (whether they are actual terrorists or just people who happen to be Iraqis or Afghans unhappy about their country being occupied is of course irrelevant) their response is always similar: They do not like the oppression that their people are subjected to.

,"I don't think this is a police action only. The recent spat of bombings in Pakistan are part of what I've been following that have lead me to think otherwise.

But, before I continue, let me stress that I do still have misgivings about this war, and that for the longest time I strongly debated with friends the case that you can't win in Afghanistan so its a waste of time to take that strategy.

Let's look at what Obama was facing when he came to power:

* Afghanistan was deteriorating. Privately, I suspect, the Pakistani were balking at American demands to do something about the militants in their territory. There was, at the time, a agreement of sorts between the Pakistani government and the tribal areas that was keeping the peace. Sidenote: I often muse at how different things might have been had Bush focused on Afghanistan instead of starting a war on a second front.

* The Mumbai attacks happened on 26 [November 2008](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Mumbai_attacks). Just after Obama was elected, before he took office. India was furious, and the attacks were suspected to have come from Pakistan.

* Obama came to office with a big promise to end the wars. Thinking about it, I can't imagine he would consider it a good idea to just break that promise casually. All apparent evidence is that the administration wrangled for a long time to decide what the appropriate course in Afghanistan was. I really believe now they really didn't want to escalate, but felt forced to.

* So, what would placate India from reprisals against Pakistan? Why should America care? I think the Administration strategists basically said, if India attacks Pakistan while we're still trying to clean things up in Afghanistan, this is going to be a bigger mess than anything else and we'll be stuck in the middle of it.

* When Obama announced the military deployment in Afghanistan, I noted the strong criticism from Pakistan against the deadline imposed by the American administration.  Eventually I came to the conclusion that there was a connection between the American deployment and the Pakistani military initiative in their tribal areas bordering Afghanistan.

* Finally, we've seen all manner of bombings in Pakistan. It's been brutal there. The Pakistani military initiative is very unpopular in Pakistan and American drone attacks have gotten a lot of headlines.  What could possibly impel a Pakistani government to endure all this stress? It has to be what I suspect is Indian pressure for something to happen.

* America had demanded under Bush of many of its allies to help. ""If you aren't with us, you are against us"" is the famously retarded thing he said back then. And so many allies did rise up to help. Canada, European countries etc... This too added pressure because their military initiatives are also unpopular. For Obama to come in and just cancel everything would smack of dumping the political cost of the war on them. Not a way to keep friends.


** And: **

So, when I said that I understand why Obama did what he felt he had to do, I meant that I see now that there was no good way to end this.  The option to just leave and let things settle would cause a lot more problems as described above.

I hate war. And I have nothing but scorn for the arrogant way the previous administration started a two wars. But starting the wars wasn't Obama's responsibility. I believe he's trying to take the practical approach based on what his advisers told him.

In conclusion, I really think the administration strongly considered your position of just leaving. Doing that would solve a lot of problems internally for the nation.  I just think that upon consideration, Obama's administration decided just leaving would be a disaster.

And that's why I said I understand what he did. That doesn't mean I'm happy with it. This war and the Iraq one have both saddened me a lot.  I just think I realize now that when the President says this is complicated, he is really speaking from his heart, but unable to give the full analysis because of all the implications that would arise out of doing so.

You are right that you can't just go around obliterating governments, but that wasn't Obama's choice. He just has to clean up.

I wrote my original reply to you late in the morning. But I hope you see that I've been giving this quite a bit of thought.

The fact that you know a cop or you've had a pleasant experience with one does not change their underlying purpose.

,"&gt;Well, yes, but it happened after tens of millions of years of mammals, and only after a regime of reptiles, amphibians and fish that lasted hundreds of millions of years while producing no advanced technology and no known instances of grammar.

Yes, but that it happened only once doesn't mean it couldn't happened again.  If humanity drops off the face of the earth, there's still a viable niche for a highly intelligent species.  Eventually something should evolve to fit that niche.

&gt;By that standard, proteins have a great system for communication that allows for tissues, immune systems, etc.

&gt;But that's not ""intelligent communication"" by a long shot, if that phrase is to mean anything at all.

Why not? Given the ability of species to interpret various smells, even on the molecular level, a rudimentary ""alphabet of smells"" or something similar could be developed.  Confining communication to language seems more a lack of imagination than anything else.

&gt;Because I think grammar is what allows abstract thought, which gives us the foresight necessary to be the only animal that can track footprints.

Once again leaving out scent here.  Even if an animal tracks by smell vs. sight, it still has the foresight to understand that there should be an animal at the end of the tracks.

&gt;This allowed us to spread around the world as hunter-gatherers, and ultimately set us on our track towards agriculture, writing, and technology.

I'd have gone with tools, farming, and clothing.  The Neanderthals were able to spread through much of Europe but didn't go much further despite most likely having the ability to conceive abstract thoughts.  They just didn't have quite enough intelligence to stave off the physically weaker homo sapiens or spread to farther off lands.

&gt;This entire exercise, remember, is to justify why we haven't yet been contacted by ETI. I'm saying that the ""because it always wipes itself out"" position does not have any convincing evidence, because it presupposes that life and intelligence are ""easy."" I don't think it is.

I wouldn't say easy, it did take those 4 billion years, but I think the better question is whether other biospheres would have niches that support highly intelligent animals.  Given the vast expanses of space, I'd say the odds are small, but still there.

&gt;Which still isn't grammar.

What would necessitate grammar then?

&gt;But grammar appears unique to human beings, and I don't think it's a coincidence that we have grammar, and subsequently were able to produce the kind of technology that we would expect an ETI to develop if we were expecting to be contacted.

,"I've only been to NYC once, and I wouldn't say I have a good feel of the neighborhoods here even.

The main entertainment district is usually called Taksim, though the neighborhood is Beyoğlu. It puts NYC to shame, from everything I remember from there. (I'm a westerner myself.) It's on the European side. Frankly, we end up there 5 out of 7 nights a week it seems. The other two, we're at home. 

Sultanahmet is the major tourist section, where Topkapı Palace and Hagia Sophia are. (and a lot of other cool stuff.) That's where you would want to stay if you only had a few days here.

In between are Eminonu and Karaköy. Karaköy has the best baklava in the world at Karaköy Güllüoğlu. (Turkish Baklava is different from Greek in that it uses so much honey that it's wet and really really sticky.) Eminonu is where you head out to the tours to the Bosphorus, and also has the spice bazaar and some cheap fish places that people say good things about.  

Most of the European side residential is more worn down, but it's easier to get to everything. The Asian side has nicer places to live, but most people work on the European side and so you have to take a ferry and the commute would suck, from my friends over there.

,"I [wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/cgirb/okay_im_a_fan_now_where_do_i_go_from_here/c0sei8x) the following two weeks ago, but it should cover some of your questions

&gt;[GoltTV](http://www.goltv.tv/index_en.php?lang=en) has live Bundesliga and La Liga and almost certainly an English language option. I have no idea where the Premier League is broadcast, but it must be somewhere. Depending where you live it’s not unlikely that you can find a bar where people watch. Having beer on Saturday morning is an acquired taste, but not that hard to acquire.

&gt;The season is the time it takes for every team in a given league to play every other team twice—once home, once away. That means that a 20 team league (England and Spain) is 38 rounds long. A 18 team league (Germany) 34 rounds. The German league also takes a break over new years (roughly 6 weeks off) because it is too cold to play.

&gt;In general leagues start in August and play until May. There is no play-off. The champion is decided on a straight league table that works like the group stage at the world cup. At the end of the season the team with the most points is the champion. Tie-breakers vary from league to league.

&gt;Domestic leagues are not the only competitions played during a season. Countries have cup-competitions. Those are less prestigious these days, but they pit teams from various levels against each other in a straight knock-out competition. So a third division side might face a first division one, which is always good fun for fans of the smaller team and brings a bit of money into their coffers.

&gt;Then there’s Europe. And in Europe there mainly is the Champions league. This is what you really want to look out for. It’s a cup competition which pits the best teams from all the European leagues against each other. First qualifying, then a group stage and finally a straight two legged knockout to whittle down the last 16 teams to two facing each other in a final at a neutral venue. The Champions league runs in parallel to the national leagues. Leagues traditionally play over the weekend (well, Friday to Monday). Champions league games are on Tuesday and Wednesday.

&gt;There also is the Europa League which is very much the smaller sibling of the Champions League. It is for teams who failed to qualify for the former as well as winners of the domestic cup competitions. Games are played on Thursdays, the format is somewhat similar to the Champions League. Stakes are lower, as is fan interest.

&gt;What you need to do is find a team you support. Most people chose one of the great sides (roughly: Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia of Spain; Marseille and Lyon of France; Munich of Germany; Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United of England. There are no good sides in Italy.) All of these teams are pretty much guaranteed to play in the Champions league year after year and feature some of the best players in the world. If you don’t want to be a bandwagon fan, though, you should support Hamburger SV of Germany. They’re really the only team that matters.

,"&gt; Eventually something should evolve to fit that niche.

Again: why did it take so long? The hypothesis I put forward is that a particular social structure is required to make very large, grammar-supporting, recursion-capable brains advantageous, rather than just resource-consuming and a survival disadvantage, and that this social structure arose only in early hominids, and that this doesn't appear to happen often at all - only once that we know of. Given that it took hundreds of millions of years, even after large, social animals were established (which is far from a given, given our sample size of 1 biosphere), I don't think it's possible to say that ""eventually"" is comfortably less than hundreds of billions of years or the life of the star system/biosphere, whichever is shorter. Which is to say: we could be first.

&gt; Why not? Given the ability of species to interpret various smells, even on the molecular level, a rudimentary ""alphabet of smells"" or something similar could be developed. Confining communication to language seems more a lack of imagination than anything else.

Except that if you have an alphabet of smells, you have a language again. I'm *not* confining communication to spoken vocabulary: I'm confining intelligent communication to grammar, no matter what the medium is. I'm saying that they are one and the same; it's a tautology. I could be wrong; a simple way to demonstrate this would be to show an example of complex communication without grammar. But I can't conceive of such a thing.

The examples you have provided are not true communication. Flocking and swarming behavior and termite nest construction are emergent behaviors of *unintelligent* local rules. They may *appear* quite complex, but their basis in simple local rules is well-understood.

&gt; Once again leaving out scent here. Even if an animal tracks by smell vs. sight, it still has the foresight to understand that there should be an animal at the end of the tracks.

No, it doesn't. An ant will follow a pheromone trail, and a hunting mammal will follow a scent trail, because it evolved to do so, because doing so is advantageous. But it's by no means [intelligent](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA37cb10WMU). They are not exhibiting intelligence or foresight. No animal - other than a human being - can see a footprint, make a mental leap to *imagine another animal creating the footprint*, deduce that an animal was there, and follow the track.

&gt; I'd have gone with tools, farming, and clothing.

These are all technologies, and the first two are by no means unique to humans. Many animals use technologies, no non-humans follow tracks or use grammar.

&gt;  The Neanderthals were able to spread through much of Europe but didn't go much further despite most likely having the ability to conceive abstract thoughts.

Neanderthals are very recent in hominid evolution. I don't think we can read much into the fact that homo sapiens sapiens is the earth species that first achieved high technology (for the purposes of ETI, radio), because I think it could just as easily have been Neanderthals or many of the other early hominids. By that time, development of radio within a million or so years at the most was basically guaranteed; we had already achieved the brain-size increase - and, yes, grammar - that ensured it.

&gt; What would necessitate grammar then?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar

&gt; ""structural rules that govern the composition of sentences, phrases, and words""

Recursion also seems somehow related; this is why I keep bringing up the social structure of proto-humans. I think that those proto-humans who could understand a social relationship \*from the reference of each of the participants\* would have had a reproductive advantage, providing the pressure for larger brain size. (Hence the example, ""A gave B C's sharp stone"".)

&gt; This may be another correlation =/= causality situations. What makes you say grammar is the source rather than increased brain capacity spawning both grammar and development?

I *don't* think grammar is the source of developments. The reproductive advantage of understanding a particular kind of social structure is the most likely source. Grammar is just one technology, it should count as an effect rather than a cause, but it's one that enabled the development of other techniques, notably tracking, which in turn greatly increased hominid fitness and led to domestication (of dogs following hunter-gatherers, of easily-gathered plants) which in turn led to agriculture, writing, and then modernity.

,"I'm thinking in the long term, though.

It's not complicated. There is no money for stimulus spending and as the current package has already shown it is not helping. The costs of federal programs are just too large and they are not sustainable. 

GOP being assholes is quite beside the point. I am a DEM and here on the hill everyone knows that we cannot continue this way. We have reached the end. There are no rich people, or corporations we can tax in sufficient quantities to balance the budget and get 13 trillion dollars out of. Our programs are just too expensive and our ability to increase revenues is limited.

The fix is not comlicated either. It's just that no one wants to make the hard choices. Europe has figured it out. Just cut spending.

,"Fully agree with the advice on a Visa card.  You'll almost certainly need a native Chip and Pin Visa or Mastercard of some sort to be able to get by as many places are now starting to refuse payment on cards without it.  Cheques are hardly ever used here also to the point that many large supermarket chains including Tesco (which is the largest in the UK) actually no longer take payment via a cheque.  

Look into getting a Visa Debit card of some sort as they're useful for paying for virtually anything directly out of your bank account.  Not only that but the majority of places will allow you to withdraw from your Visa debit up to £50 cashback direct from your bank account at the checkouts/tills when paying for goods.  With one of these cards, a trip to the bank can become a rarity...

Vehicle rental here is usually only done on the short term for going on short breaks or as one off usage and as such is priced expensively to compensate for lack of long term use/ income.  Its far cheaper to buy.

As for motorcycle usage i should warn you that at times winter usage can be impractical as winters here can be occasionally damned cold.  This past winter the coldest temperature recorded where i live was -19c which is below 0 degrees Fahrenheit and it was consistenly cold for several weeks.  Secondly I believe as a visitor you will be entitled up to 12 months usage of a foreign drivers licence (must have motorcycle entitlement on it) before you actually need to go the learner route and take lessons and a test thats a pain to do.  Theres a nice info graphic here on how to obtain a UK licence.

Be aware as well that wearing an European ECE certified helmet here is a legal requirement here so If you're planning to bring a helmet with you then it may not be legal for use here.

A Police officer may turn a blind eye to you having a non standard helmet however but they certainly will come down on you like a tonne of bricks for not wearing a helmet at all or even wearing it incorrectly.  A friend of mine was given a fixed penalty notice for £30 despite wearing his helmet simply because he absent mindedly left the strap undone.

Speak for your own city. [These are just the projects (mostly residential) that are in the works in my city in one district alone.](http://i.imgur.com/zIBF1.jpg) And that's an old map. More have been added.

&gt; That apartment is indeed quite pretty. How much does it cost? I'm going to bet it's ""a fuckload"".

Well, it wasn't an apartment. It was a loft, which you buy, not rent, just like a house in the suburbs. Those were CGI renderings. It's not finished yet. But suffice it to say those will be an arm and a leg. In fact, it's a hotel/office building/residence and the room service and cleaning service will serve both hotel customers and residents alike (which is nuts), but there are cheaper condos/lofts downtown; some in the 2-300's, which is just like buying a house in the suburbs, only with these you get more amenities, like access to way more entertainment and culture than in any suburb in America, restaurants, shopping, night life, amazing views, etc.

My sister pays a lot to live where she does, sure. But she gets paid more and she doesn't have a car to pay for. Most people don't realize how much money they spend on their car every month. It's kind of a lot! 

My point is that we can build the urban, mixed-use model (residences on top, businesses on bottom) *anywhere* (even right where suburbs are). To equate this with ""the metropolis"", I think, is wrong. They build this way in small towns and in Europe. Why abandon it?

,"True points... I like a lot the Champions League don't get me wrong. 

But I think the fact that the World Cup is held every 4 years makes it a truly special event. Plus it's national teams. Clubs lack identity nowadays, it's all about money, buying and selling, some players play in 2 different teams during the same season.

There are issues in regards to the world cup, the outcome is often inferior to the club's performance, but you have to relativize, since clubs train more and play more often with each other. Players in national teams for most countries find themselves playing few games with new players just before the world cup. This is why there are a lot of issues regarding teamwork, the only team that does not suffer this is Spain, because most of its players play in Barcelona together, some in Real Madrid, they won't really feel the difference.


I think the best solution is during a world cup year, all leagues and cups should stop a bit earlier, a month earlier would be great for players.

Less attention was given to downtowns for a number of reasons; racism (white flight), cheap land, and a total confidence in the perpetual availability of cheap energy, which we now know is wrong. And, I think, the more we feel the pinch, the more people are going to demand mixed-use developments. So, to answer your question: it wasn't a lot, now it's becoming a lot.

,"&gt;This study doesn't support your [statement about significant warming]

You apparently didn't read your own citation. The very first sentence of the overview is:

""The Earth warmed by roughly 0.6°C (1°F) during the 20th century and is projected to warm by an additional ~2–6°C during the 21st century.""

&gt;The point about W and nukes is that he let the applications for new plants come forward. That was a HUGE deal. What's IMPORTANT are applications for new plants; all the committees, etc. are just window dressing.

A huge deal would have been an Atoms for Peace-style speech or funding a breeder reactor program. The NRC has been taking applications that haven't resulted in plants for years.

&gt;For Fed funding, I can't believe that any such is needed. The electric utilities are really good at issuing debt and have some cute provisions in the tax laws that help them. Interest rates are low. I have to believe that electric utilities can fund new nuke plants.

They have been fairly blunt about their inability to build Gen III nukes without loan guarantees (which Obama [actually issued](http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/02/16/obama.jobs/index.html), unlike W). Note that this is different from actual loans, so if all goes well it will not cost the federal government anything. 

&gt;So, coal: Half of our electric power, in place, 24 x 7 reliable, cheap. GOOD.

Convert it to coal gasification then. It will cut the bad pollutants out and half the CO2 emissions. Do you have a problem with phasing out traditional coal-fired plants in favor of coal gasification? This can be done with a retrofitting in most cases.

&gt;So, I don't want to tax the coal plants or to ""bankrupt"" new coal plants and Obama wants to do both. For ""tax"" he still wants his cap and trade shakedown. For ""bankrupt"", I gave the YouTUBE URL of his SF Chron interview where he said ""bankrupt"" any new coal plants. What he wants to do with our coal plants would shoot our economy in the gut.

I've seen it and bankrupting new coal projects is the economically sound thing to do because the projects are currently not paying their externalities. This doesn't mean that current plants will be shut off immediately (the initial caps will cover current emissions and give the industry time to draw them down), it just means we won't build new ones. And there is no evidence that this will ""shoot our economy in the gut"". The Europeans have had high fuel taxes for years and their GDPs have grown at about the same rates as the US. Also, the French were able to largely replace coal in about a decade of heavy construction of nukes. The US could do the same thing.

&gt;I don't like shooting our economy in the gut and don't like people trying to do that.

So, you mean like how W's boys just sat idle while the banks ran up the leverage ratios so high that any downturn in the market would cause a liquidity crisis?

&gt;Next, while nukes should be cheaper than coal, there remain questions about how fast we can build nukes, where we can build them, and if we really can build them.

Learn about small nukes. This allows utilities to affordably scale up nuclear operations without having to jump in $5 billion increments.

&gt;So, in the meanwhile, we need coal.

No one denies this. We are dependent on coal right now. I want to change that.

&gt;Also, if we do too much with nukes, then we will have all our electric energy eggs in just one basket and, thus, will be vulnerable as a nation from screaming, neurotic, deluded, self-destructive, dangerous greenies looking for excuses to shutdown all the nukes, shutdown industry, return to some Currier and Ives image, and kill tens of millions of US citizens. They'd try. You NEED to understand this, and that Obama wants their votes. They are self-destructive -- I will omit just why.

The anti-nukes aren't as powerful as they were in the 70s. Just look at France. It is a significantly more liberal place than the US, and the anti-nukes aren't able to do a damned thing because the general public knows how important nuclear power is.

&gt;Yes, some of the new nuke construction going forward in the US now is by French companies.

Areva is the company involved. And even if they build it, it will create jobs here because operations and security for a nuclear power plant obviously cannot be outsourced.

&gt;W had no such phobias and was willing to do big things, e.g., Iraq. I have to strain not to conclude that what W did in Iraq was not just a mess, but at least he did something. I would have left Saddam in place. Net, W didn't have the Obama phobias. C student? Yes. Phobic? No.

So, the stimulus and health care laws weren't big things? You are contradicting yourself. :)

And doing something big without thinking it through (e.g. the planning for post-war Iraq) is not a virtue. If I was in W's spot, I would have just assassinated Saddam and moved on with life. Bush got distracted. He should have focused on Afghanistan and Pakistan at the time. When he broke the international good will towards the US because of Iraq, he severely harmed the effectiveness of anti-terrorism. If you want to see how to defeat a foreign government that is pissing you off, learn about the CIA in the 50s. Just send in a few smart guys to bribe the right people, assassinate the right people, etc. This didn't always work (e.g. Castro), but it worked most of the time (Iran, Guatamala, etc.)


&gt;E.g., nearly no one in climate science will have the measure theory and stochastic process background to understand the math of diffusion processes, and I do.

Congrats to you for thinking your background is superior. Go do the research and get the national academies to listen to you then. Until then, the consensus is against you and you look like the crazy one.

&gt;For the greenhouse effect contributing to global warming, that's obviously essentially just crap: (1) CO2 levels are actually comparatively high now, but the planet ain't getting warmer at any significant rate as far as we can tell. So, if CO2 were really to heat the planet, then we should be seeing temperature rise, but we are not. 

You are in denial about the recent temperature rise data (e.g. ['High Confidence' That Planet Is Warmest in 400 Years](http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=11676)). Did you seriously not read your own citation above?

&gt;Your claim that scientists agree on this global warming stuff has to be mostly BS: NO well trained, objective scientists will look at either the theory or the temperature data and conclude that we have solid evidence of global warming. The science just ain't there. The reaction has to be from laughter to an upchuck. It just ain't science. Why? The climate is FAR too difficult to model accurately, in detail over years. Period.

I'm not technically trained in the area (I have some background in physics, but that is it), but I'm not going to take the word of one guy on the Internet (who could be faking everything he says about credentials for all I know, or worse could be a paid disinformation agent trolling social networks) over the statements of the National Academies and the Royal Society. So, until you can convince the relevant bodies of science, you are the crackpot point of view. By all means, if you really believe this stuff, then go do the research and publish the results. If your work holds water, then people will listen. Until then, your anti-IPCC claims are just conspiracy theories. Getting scientists to agree on something is like herding cats, so a actual real-world conspiracy is not going to happen.

&gt;Your charging at 220 V omits the big issue: Current. Again, my estimate is that standard two-phase 110/220 V house service will have to be increased from 100 A to 10,000 A. Again, let me step back before you connect that thang.

Now this is an area where I am technically trained (electrical/computer engineering background) and you are dead wrong. You still assume that you have to have a 3 minute charge for usable electric cars. As I've said repetitively (and you've ignored), the car will charge slowly while parked, which for most people will enable them to eliminate most of their liquid fuel consumption.

As for high current connections in the future, I'm not afraid of these at all. It will only be done at charging stations and I already go to a gas station several times a month. The danger of high current connections is much less than hydrocarbons. For example, I'd much rather live near a transmission line than a natural gas pipeline.

&gt;Various people hope to get various things. 

Well, the hydrocarbon industry certainly is paying people to go on disinformation campaigns against global warming to get what they want, for sure.

Edit: [Response](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/11/chaos-and-climate/) from Real Climate about Navier-Stokes importance in long term climate modeling. To me, an analogy seems to be the nature of approximation. For example, if I want to know the precise quantum state of a particular atom, I'll have to invoke low level details of particle physics. If I want to know the trajectory of that atom as part of a larger object, I can just rely on Newtonian mechanics. So, it seems here that you are being pedantic in claiming that because extremely precise modeling cannot be done at the low level, that macro-level modeling is impossible. The same thing applies to pretty much any complex system from a diode (I don't care about the position of specific electrons and holes, just that current is flowing in one direction) to the economy (e.g. we don't know which businesses will fail, but we can observe long term GDP growth trends). So, you would make a great weatherman (assuming you aren't lying about your background), and don't have the right skills for climate modeling.",1278373626,c0tkxrd,True,,ElectricRebel,1426367967,0,t5_2qhkd,0,True,2,0,t1_c0tkxrd,False,t1_c0tjw3f,2,t3_clrkc,,energy

,"My response is two-fold.  First, it is completely inaccurate to call the Turkish perspective ""previous interest"" as the Turkish are both still on the island and are presently engaged in deliberate immigration to the island of Cyprus.

In fact, I just happened to have listened to a Cypriot ambassador on the issue just last year.

See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Cyprus

See: 

&gt; Northern Cyprus has **received diplomatic recognition only from Turkey**, upon which it is dependent for economic, political and military support. The rest of the international community, including the United Nations and the European Union, recognises the de jure sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus over the entire island.

This is a current problem.  An ongoing one.  Essentially, Northern Cyprus is a colonial territory or occupied area of Cyprus.  It is currently dependent on Turkey for basically everything.  Thus, it is not ""previous interest.""


----


Second, I never said disregard the Turkish anger, but to understand its context and lack of substantial value.  Anyone who reads this article or sees this post and thinks it is a Major local power of influence should instead view it for what it is - hypocrisy.  Hypocrites aren't de facto wrong, however, their bombastic attitude reeks of do as I say not as I do and it makes the comments cut hollow.  

No other country in the world beside Turkey recognizes Turkish ""Northern Cyprus"" as a state.  Similarly, the control they exercise over the area is akin to the control in Israel over Gaza.  The way Northern Cyprus stays independent is by getting money and troops and people from Turkey and is otherwise an invention of the Turkish government.  A minority political party does not a separate state make.

Your comment simply misses the point that Turkey's threat is really a hollow, bullshit comment of a state that has done as it pleased with half an island and the world has barely said a thing.

,"As a possibly interesting aside, I run a fairly high-profile security and hospitality firm in Australia, and spend a fair bit of time training bouncers so they get used to identifying juveniles and adults (this is in Australia, so for 18+). 

Several of the industry bodies recommend checking ID if people look under 25 (implying that most people who look over 25 will be adults), but I find that this ""cutoff"" ranges from 20-30, dependent on a number of factors:

* People with a dominant asian background tend to look younger for longer. At least until 30. Then they age physically surprisingly quickly!
* I would say the same about eastern european women, too.
* Generally, I find it easier to judge a man's age than a woman. That said, I'm a man myself, this may contribute to that.
* Facial hair is very very relevant. If I see someone with just a little bit of 'fuzz' (clearly grown out, but not thick or 'stubbly'), I'm going to assume they're adolescent/pubescent.
* Similarly, thick beard of facial hair will boost your perceived age by a few years.
* Smaller hips tend to make one look more childlike, IMHO. (This may explain my bias towards thinking women look younger than men).
* Ditto rounder faces. The term ""baby face"" springs to mind.

I don't know for exactly what purpose you want to know about this (perhaps, finding out at what point people treat you like an adult), but it's not just your facial and body features. In addition to your maturity, yada yada yada, your voice is key.

If you're male, judgement of age isn't just about having a **deep** voice, but one where you sound clearly confident of the tone. This makes sense because it would imply that the tone of your voice hasn't changed recently, and thus puberty was a while ago.

,"Yes, Japan is near insolvent with one of the highest debt to GDP ratios in the world. China is showing signs of economic weakness and slowed demand. Europe is going through a regional economic crisis that may end up blowing up on a global scale. The U.K has record budget deficits and high unemployment similar to the U.S..

The USA is printing money to counteract deflationary forces and running record budget deficits in the process. Many U.S. states are on the verge of bankruptcy (in order of likelyhood: Illinois, California and New York). Inflation worries are a red herring. The real problem with the economy is that it was propped up by over inflated asset prices. Now that the assets aren't worth anything or worth less than 50% of their original value (home loans for example), a lot of money, to the tune of 10's of trillions of dollars was destroyed. Banks are holding onto properties to manipulate the price of housing and in some cases allowing foreclosed individuals to stay in the property.

The actual unemployment rate in the U.S. is close to the Great Depression all time high of 25% at roughly 22% of people who are seeking full-time work but can't obtain it. The current ""official"" statistics of 9.5% cherry-pick individuals and leaves out large groups such as young people entering the workforce after high school/ college, people who work only part-time because that's all they can find, self-employed people who lost their business in the economic collapse, people who ran out of unemployment benefits but still haven't found a job, etc. The move from 9.7% unemployment to 9.5% last month was due to unemployed people losing their benefits, not because the economy grew more jobs.

The U.S. spends 10's of billions of dollars a month that it doesn't have on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In many cases, the money is going straight to the ""terrorists"" we're trying to flush out via pay-offs to regional warlords in Afghanistan. There is no long-term benefit from spending this money to train drug addict, illiterate Afghanistani men to become soldiers when they are defecting to the enemy after training.

&gt;  A brief History: Les Kiriki - Acrobates japonais

&gt;  (Ki Ri Ki - Japanese Acrobats)
&gt;  Production date: 1907

&gt;  Irresistible film that inspired many artists (including choreographer Philippe Decouflé), this three-minute gem was shot by Segundo de Chomón (1871-1929), special effect specialist hired by Pathé to direct a series of films based on special effects and meant to compete with those of Georges Méliès.

&gt;  Chomón witnesses the birth of the cinematograph in 1896 during a stay in Paris. This Spanish man originating from Teruel quits his office job and starts working for Georges Méliès as a colorist. He moves on to Pathé Frères where he contributes to set up a system of industrial coloring: the Pathécolor.

&gt;  In 1901, Chomón settles in Barcelona. He directs numerous documentaries, has a go at animation and effects. Called back by Pathé to Paris, Chomón works as a camera operator on Le Roi des Aulnes (The Erl-King) in particular. He directs all in all about forty films and makes an attempt at every genre.


&gt;  This film only existed in its black and white version. Thank to the collaboration of the Cinémathèque Française, depositary of the black and white original single-perf negative, we have been able to make three positive prints. Hélène Bromberg colored the film in the old fashion way, frame by frame, using as a color chart a 2-meter long fragment of the nitrate original, rediscovered in a private collection.",1278380821,c0tl6i7,False,,saintmuse,1426368080,0,t5_6,0,True,1,0,t1_c0tl6i7,False,t3_cmbat,1,t3_cmbat,,reddit.com

,"Knew a girl fresh from Bulgaria, met her the day after she arrived in the US, she sounded more American than did I. Knew an Italian who had been living here for over 25 years, sounded like he got off the boat yesterday, couldn't understand a fucking thing he said. 

With that said, we do have too many Indian immigrants coming into this country. They're like the Killer Bees from South America, they've been swarming across the US for years after starting out mainly on the west coast. They move into an area, seemingly enmasse, and buy up all of the convenience stores and motels. They don't operate the convenience stores in a manner the local clientele is accustomed. They immediately cut out the vendors like Coke and Pepsi and the local bakeries, and they go to Costco or Sam's Club and buy their own. They stock their shelves with many items that are unfamiliar to the majority of the demographic. Their perishables go bad, because no one is buying them, but they don't remove them from the shelves. They rarely dust or clean these shelves so it looks trashy. The vendors usually do all of this stock rotation for store owners, but these Indians only see the vendor as an unnecessary middle-man. They increase the temperature of their coolers to one degree below room temperature to save money so the beer and sodas are not cold. Subsequently, people mostly refuse to do business with these Indian owned stores, except for gas, cigarettes and lotto tickets. I know many people who will drive miles past several Indian-owned stores to go to an American owned store, but then these people are called racists. Not true. Operate the fucking store in a manner that will draw customers in, idiots. 

We're allowing too many Indian professionals into this country and they are taking jobs from Americans, trust me, I know. I work for a large heavy equipment manufacturer and I have seen our Design Team go from four Americans to three Indians and one American. It's not only the lower-wage earners that are losing jobs to immigrants. The large companies push for this too. Instead of moving jobs out of the country they are pushing the government to allow for more immigrants with professional degrees to move in. And we're not talking Europeans, we're talking mostly highly educated third world immigrants, Indians, for the most part. The companies bring them in and pay them substantially less than what they pay the Americans. The end result is our entire standard of living is being attacked on all sides thanks to the government and big business.

Its not that simple, in fact differentiating populations based on skin color or many other superficial differences shows that you don't understand genetics.
So I can't really help you, only suggest an education.

I took some time to look through your post history before I replied and came across this gem:

&gt; one in the arctic and one in the tropics. In the arctic you need the cooperation of the group to survive the winter, in the tropics you could pretty well go lone wolf year round. Anyone with anti-social personality disorder would be at risk of alienating the group and dying in the arctic once winter comes, vs. the tropical one who can survive without.

I mean, you could at least read up on the societies you're trying to talk about. 

I could go on, but there are numerous examples in your post history that lead me to the conclusion that A) you don't really understand the term ""race"" ( ""One example: the femur (leg) of Africans is straighter, whereas in Europeans it tends to be curved."" it seems you don't understand that in Africa there are many distinct groups whose physical traits differ greatly) B) you *want* to believe that your group is ""better"" than others and you use the tried-and-true ""Well, I'm not a racist, but it would be unfortunate if science was made to bow to political correctness yadda yadda yadda"" and rather predictably you have libertarian leanings. Very common with people who really want to *believe* that racial differences are major and real and matter.

,"To expand on your point, here's an [a comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/byql1/winds_latest_problem_it_makes_power_too_cheap/c0p8gy7) from the last time this was posted:

----

I worked in energy for years. The one quote that sums up the real reasons utilities don't like wind is this:

&gt;    The key thing here is that we are beginning to unveil what I've labelled the dirty secret of wind: utilities don't like wind not because it's not competitive, but because it brings prices down for their existing assets, thus lowering their revenues and their profits.

But there is one complication to this that environmentalists need to recognize.

With the liberty of some simplification, electricity in the US and Europe is priced hourly in auctions. Each generator is asked for a price at which they are willing to generate electricity and for the amount of electricity they can generate. The auction clears at the price where supply meets demand, that is, every generator gets paid the same price no matter what it costs them to produce the electricity.

In a very simplified example, a small town requires 1000MW for the next hour. There are no wind generators that supply this town, only a coal plant and a natural gas plant. The coal operator can supply 700MW at a price of $20/MW, the gas operator can supply 500MW at $27/MW. The market will clear at $27/MW, taking 700MW from the coal plant and 300MW from the gas plant. The coal operator will get paid ($27/MW)x(700MW) = $18,900 for that hour and the gas operator will get paid ($27/MW)x(300MW) = $8,100. If we assume that both operators are pricing in $2/MW of margin (profit) into their prices, that means the coal plant profits ($27/MW - $18/MW)x(700MW) = $6,300 and the gas plant profits ($27/MW - $25/MW)x(300MW) = $600.

Now say the town installs 500MW capacity of windmills. Let's rerun the scenario. The town needs 1000MW for one hour again. The wind operator says the wind is blowing moderately and it can supply 300MW for $2/MW (essentially his costs are $0/MW - he doesn't need to pay to use the wind and there are no workers and wages to pay). The operators put the same bids as before. Now the market clears at $20/MW because you only need the supply from the wind and coal operators to meet demand. Wind profits ($20/MW - $0/MW)x(300MW) = $6,000; coal profits ($20/MW - $18/MW)x(700MW) = $1,400; and gas profits $0.

As you can see, the coal and gas plants become less profitable. So tough shit to them, right? Well okay fuck coal, but now you have replaced a relatively clean and reliable source (natural gas) with a clean but unreliable source (wind). So the point is that wind (and solar) have a tendency to cut the profits of coal, but not necessarily eliminate their emissions (in the example, coal was running at 700MW in both scenarios). Furthermore, wind and solar have the tendency to price relatively clean and reliable sources out of the market.

I am not trying to bash wind (or solar), but I just want people to realize they are not reliable sources of energy and they do not have the muscle to get rid of the cheapest and dirtiest emitters (coal).

,"&gt;You must be scanning our posts assiduously indeed. We talk about you all the time, and you seem to catch us every time.

Not really. I do know other people who post here, however, and this was shown to me for a chuckle. The only reasons I posted were because I figured that XFDRaven's posts about me called up 3 pages of links on Google (which is what was linked to me), I'd probably hurt him and owed him an apology.

&gt;You know we're all speaking for an audience here, and you have many more fans than I do.

::shrugs:: I've received nice comments from time to time, I don't know if I really have lots of ""fans"" though. I mean, it'd be pretty cool. Think of the merchandising. But honestly I write for myself, usually because I'm bored or the subject is of interest to me. This may surprise you to learn, but back when I was a wee one, my first internet experience was debating in the online message board of a British newspaper. I've been a forum junkie ever since. :P Done plenty of productive things in my time, but when I shoot the shit online, I'd usually rather post in places like this than play Bejeweled or Farmville.

But I certainly don't write to impress any fans. People disagree with me all the time. Some critiquing nicely, others rather aggressively. 'Tis just the way of things.

&gt;one tactic I found particularly disagreeable was the characterization of arguments as ""right-wing"" or conservative.

While I employ this a lot I do not see it as unfair.

I have done exactly the same thing with feminists. The reason you haven't seen it is because- luckily- the vast majority of Reddit's self identified feminist folks are not ageing Second Wavers and man haters or transphobes. Typically I employ comparisons to right wing beliefs when one of that slowly fading generation comes out with, say, a stated belief in an unequivocal ban on pornography or prostitution (positions I've characterised as ""counterproductive"" when I'm feeling nice and ""stupid"" when I'm not), or with transphobia (see: Julie Bindel, whose ""work"" I've repeatedly trashed on Reddit), I often state plainly that they're evoking right wing and/or conservative arguments.

Because they are; most of this particular claque of feminists aren't even especially good at circumlocutions that deftly elide that fact. They indulge in characterisations (say, of transgender people) that are remarkably similar to conservatives. Bindel herself evokes Ann Coulter with her vituperative attempts at ""humour"" that are just plain bigoted.

So, don't feel singled out.

Generally, arguments about the clash of civilsations between the West and Islamic culture that extol the West's virtues in contrast to a perceived structural inferiority of the culture of Muslim immigrants tends to be very popular in conservative circles and is a popular talking point. Women's rights was a popular trojan horse for the last US presidential administration to engage in Middle Eastern wars and for contemporary European politicians (almost all, you will note, from the right of the spectrum, whether it's in Switzerland, Holland, or France) to score political points off of saying unkind things about immigrants.

Now, I do not want to relitigate that post. I even considered deleting the foregoing paragraph but I'm explaining *why* I use these terms. They have ample grounding in the trade winds of contemporary politics, and I do not feel it's unfair. A person can indulge in arguments oft favoured by conservatives without often being conservative themselves, and vice versa. It's a critical point of intellectual interrogation to get at *why* that discrepancy exists. What was it about that particular train of thought that they liked and got them on board?

Like the transphobic and anti-sex feminists of yore, they can't provide an answer usually. The direct comparisons to, say, the Christian Right are more a ""do you know who and what you sound like?"" kind of deal than implying they're secretly deeply conservative and get off on F.A. Hayek.

&gt;As an example, avoiceformen recently made a post comparing feminism to communism. While his points were accurate and well-founded, he made the mistake of titling his submission straightforwardly. This naturally attracted downvoters, who wiped out his thoughtful post without ever bothering to consider his arguments.

Mr. Elam and I have met. Personally I'm not convinced he argues much of anything in good faith and his writing is very much- as you say- speaking to an audience.

I decided to look at his article for funsies. Quoting directly:

&gt;Feminism is a Marxist strategy designed to undermine the family and all other traditional institutions so that the primary relationship individuals have is ultimately with The State.

This is, throughout the article, supported primarily by assertion. Feminism has a Marxist tradition within it, yes. I'm good friends with someone who in fact identifies as a Marxist Feminist (surprise, she's really very sweet). But feminism is not a subset of Marxism, nor did it grow out of it. Feminism and Marxism (in all of their multifarious, often conflicting, incarnations) interacted a lot over the last 120 years or so, because they were both radical movements operating against entrenched systems of power. But where there was overlap, there was also immeasurable disagreement and many irreconcilable differences.

The idea that feminists believe in an all powerful State is also not necessarily true. Anarchism *also* has a longrunning current within feminism. Emma Goldman, a suffragette-era feminist, was way ahead of her time in that respect. Contemporary Wiccan activist and feminist Starhawk believes state power can never be used for good ends and sees the ideal world as a decentralised one. On and on.

But anyway:

&gt;In the west we have been blinded to the true nature of all this massive social change with unbridled, shallow consumerism, political correctness and the intentional erosion of our education system.  Children, from grade school to high school are dissuaded from critical thinking and pressured into conformity by a Marxist Feminist pedagogy.  It is the perfect set up to participate in a system of higher education that is geared primarily for indoctrination.

So, the schools are Marxist, the teaching methods are Marxist inspired, ""political correctness"" runs rampant, masculinity is being criminalised, the family is being destroyed, and the state is elevated to total supremacy.

This *is* inspired by a lot of right wing thinking. He even quotes Ayn Rand. Using Marxism and Communism as straw men is, as my mum likes to say, old as the cold among conservative and rightward interests.

Now, again, I'm not trying to get into an intellectual debate about the subject matter since we're really just talking about *characterisation* here. Calling his piece conservative is well within bounds, regardless of its factuality. My point about the history and present day reality of feminism was to say that it's definitely not a child of Marxism (Mary Wollstonecraft might have something to say about that. Or Sojourner Truth) and is not, as a whole, part of it.

You are right that Reddit is majority-liberal. That is undeniable. And it is also true that such headlines likely wouldn't fly with them, feminist or no. But the headline seemed a pretty accurate descriptor of what lay within. As to Subversive, I don't know if he really derailed you either. He had 1 upvote when I clicked your link.

So I suppose my ultimate point is that calling something 'conservative' when it evokes that is quite fair. Reddit's liberal bias is known, and that might spell bad news for a conservative link. But what do you want people to do? Mischaracterise it in an intellectually dishonest way?

At any rate, I am sorry this went on for so long, and I realise I might seem to be dangling debate bait here, but I'm really not trying to. It's just hard to address the topic of 'disagreeable characterisation' without specifically dealing with the issues themselves, I'm afraid. =/

But this is a good discussion! Thought provoking.

,"&gt;What about work visas etc? How much time do you usually have to give yourself to secure one? 

The school you choose to work for (or program) will usually get that sorted out for you. All you have to do is send them the necessary paperwork and documents and they will take care of it. If the school needs someone fast, they might just have you fly over and start working, then work on the visa when you get there, which is what I did. 

I didn't have an ounce of experience when I first started and the majority of schools (including EPIK) won't require any. They might put you through a little ""training"", but you will likely have to figure things out for yourself. It's not difficult though, just make sure to ask your director exactly what she wants you to do as far as books and tests are concerned (they have a habit of not telling you important things like that).

It seems obvious from the fascinating quotes from Jefferson you supply that his convictions belong to the Protestant tradition, which tends towards schismatic sects and, ultimately, individualism.

," * The roads are pretty crappy. On the Gold Coast there are always road works (Just near my house there is an 18 week upgrade starting). So be prepared for delays.
 * Internet is damn expensive. No unlimited anything. Most telcommunications cost a little more since they have so much area to cover but few people compared to Europe or Asia.
 * We get everything later than the rest of the world. It isn't so bad these days but still a pain.
 * Shipping is expensive for buying things from other countries. And a lot of stores don't ship to Australia.
 * Compared to the USA, our petrol is expensive. At the moment it is $1.20 - $1.35 per litre of regular unleaded. Kinda puts a slow drain on your wallet.
 * ""Cable"" or PayTV (Foxtel or Austar) is expensive. So much so we cancelled our supscription after they found about the hacked cards we were using.

So cable will be at least $100, and internet will be at least $60 for decent quota. Shop around though. Don't go with Bigpond.

But on the plus side...

 * People are usually friendly.
 * The cops are nice if you're doing everything like you're supposed to.
 * The weather is kinda nice.

Tell your friends to go to Melbourne. It is my favourite place to go (originally from there). Remember that our seasons are reversed. We're in Winter at the moment so it is pretty cold down there. Still nice though.

It might sound very expensive but I'm a student at the moment so everything is expensive for me. If your friends have good professions then they should be good!

""Ah yes, this woman was photographed by Yugheni Malzokof, one of the original masters of erotic fashion photography"".

Be sure to start dressing like a character in a glamorous 1950s European art film and have impressive leatherbound books scattered around your desk with titles like ""Appreciating the Female Form"" etc.

Trace l'inégal palindrome. Neige. Bagatelle, dira Hercule. Le brut repentir, cet écrit né Perec. L'arc lu pèse trop, lis à vice-versa.

Perte. Cerise d'une vérité banale, le Malstrom, Alep, mort édulcoré, crêpe porté de ce désir brisé d'un iota. Livre si aboli, tes sacres ont éreinté, cor cruel, nos albatros. Etre las, autel bâti, miette vice-versa du jeu que fit, nacré, médical, le sélénite relaps, ellipsoïdal.

Ivre il bat, la turbine bat, l'isolé me ravale: le verre si obéi du Pernod -- eh, port su ! -- obsédante sonate teintée d'ivresse.

- I live in the 3e, near the Place des Vosges -- it's really awesome, and we're hugely lucky.

- Actually it's complicated, yes and now -- I am on a Dutch work contract, but staying in Paris (I'm the only guy on my team who speaks French and English) at the office of a French subsidiary of my company.  Switzerland is part of the Schengen community, so yes, that makes it hugely difficult -- but it's not an impossible obstacle if you are not European.
- Right now, the Glou, but we keep discovering new places.  Also depends on where you want to go, what kind of food you like, what is your price range, etc. -- I can give you tips until the end of the day...

- Yes, we take a lot of trips.  My girlfriend and I drive, though; weekends tend to be pretty people-packed, so if you're on public transport, you really need to plan a bit.  There isn't _that_ much within about 50km of Paris (mainly suburbs and one or two significant historical  places, like Versailles), but if you're willing to drive a few hours, you can easily get to amazing locations like Normandy, la Champagne, the Alsace, Bourgogne, and even further afield.

,"actually, on average there is an even distribution of bullshit artists on both sides of the spectrum. it just so happens that the country, sociopolitically and economically, is positioned too far to the right. in particular, after 8 years of really horrendous right wing policies, the whole of the nation is highly critical of any further move towards conservative right wing policies: big corporations, big wars. so those who do advocate them (like Hannity and crew) are more visible because there are more people to hate them. Give it another 8 years of left wing mollycoddling and it is likely more people will be critical of the typically left wing voices in the media (maybe maddow). what we do really want is to have people who are independent thinkers: left wing or right wing - just use common sense. but high salaries and years of inculcation for these people can disable their ability to think for themselves. so in conclusion, there is an even distribution of bullshit artists, its just that the conservative bullshit artists are way more prominent at the moment because the whole country has leaned rather too far in that direction. finally, i would like to note i think there are countries to who have a more level headed approach: finland?, australia? perhaps, some parts of europe - just be sure to be able to think for yourself. dont be swallowed up by money etc.",1278402821,c0tlvjt,False,,nomise,1426368404,0,t5_2cneq,0,True,2,0,t1_c0tlvjt,False,t1_c0tlv4a,2,t3_cme1x,,politics

All applications for all Swedish Universities are handled by the [Swedish Agency for Higher Education Services](http://www.vhs.se/sv/Om-VHS/English/) (Sw. *Verket för Högskoleservice*). Their website is in Swedish only, but there is information in English on the application website.

You apply via the web, for more information and application, go to [www.studera.nu](https://www.studera.nu/studera/1374.html) (Swedish for ""study.now""). You can also find more information about studying in Sweden on the Swedish Institute website, [studyinsweden.se](http://www.studyinsweden.se/).

At the moment foreign students don't have to pay any tuition fees when studying in Sweden, but that will change in 2011/2012. You can read a little more about it on the studera.nu page. Also, about scholarships for non-EU-students, see [thelocal.se](http://www.thelocal.se/followsweden/article/Tuition-fees-from-2011/).

,"I have two theories.

In Sweden and I think Germany as well, nationalism isn't really seen as something good, even on the verge as racism. Unless done for sport. Perhaps in England the nationalism is spread out more and not as focused on sports. One difference (though I can't speak for Germany on this one) I have noticed while listening to 606 on BBC radio 5 after England matches. The English people who phone up say things like ""Hi Alan, I'm an England fan..."" as if it isn't implied. You're English, how can you not be an England fan? (I have heard of English people, Liverpudlians or Mancunians who don't actually support England) I can't imagine that happening here. Whether football, hockey, handball, tennis or curling. Whether you care about the sport or not. When it's a World Cup, World Championship, European Championship or Olympics. You support those who represent Sweden.

Then we have the English media. Every two years since 1966 you're written up as world champions, every two years the team has disappointed you. Even though you probably shouldn't be considered among the favourites every time. This has been done so many times and over such a long period of time people have just lost faith and started to resent the whole thing. This year for example, some key players come off bad seasons.

,"&gt; Seems like I might have hit a nerve.

My parents bought me an airfare to Europe as an 18th birthday present. My family is far from wealthy, and at the time my folks were close to bankruptcy. Still, they wanted to pay for it, they saved up for it, and it was a great gift. I paid for everything else myself by working a whole bunch of low-paying jobs, both in Australia and in Europe.

I've never had a ""handout"" from my parents, at least not in the sense you mean. (They've given me free room and board occasionally when I've been seriously between cash, but it's infrequent.) I've worked my arse off since I was old enough to do so; so has my little sister, and so have most of my friends.

I'm not disputing that there are rich North Shore private-school kids who have their Contiki tours paid for, although attempting to claim that living off Daddy's money is solely a Gen-Y phenomenon is a bit rich. There are a bunch of good, honest, hardworking Gen-Y people around who weren't born with silver spoons in hand.

,"&gt;Well, duh... of course that's one of the major focal points... After all, that EXACT purpose was very clearly stated as a reason in the Second Amendment to our country's Constitution, explaining why Americans should always retain a right to own firearms.

And you think its still relevant hundreds of years later? That is precious. The founding fathers also had slaves. Clearly they were not right about everything.

&gt;YES.

Well then you are delusional. They have tanks and stealth bombers and all kinds of other stuff. If they want you dead badly enough, no pile of small arms is going to save you.

&gt;Uhm, yeah, about that... WE DO VOTE.

For George Bush. For a government that goes around the world sponsoring terrorists to overthrow democratic governments that are anti-American. To destabilise entire continents. To steal the resources of third world nations while their people starve to death to the tune of 100 000 a day. Yeah you Americans did a great job of voting. But as long as you have your little gun you can feel as if you are capable of defending yourself from the US government huh? Wake up: look at what your government has done to the planet especially the middle east and Africa. Your right to bear arms is irrelevant and obsolete.

&gt;And so far we keep voting to retain our Second Amendment Rights.

Actually, I don't think thats ever been voted on. The SCOTUS upholds it because they are a bunch of right wing maniacs.

&gt;Sorry if that gets your knickers in a bunch, but that's how it is here. No amount of your whinging about it will change that fact.

It's ok. I know I will win anyway. In Europe we got over pretending that having a gun somehow magically makes you safer and that not having a gun means you will be raped and murdered within the week. Americans like you will grow up eventually and realise that you can't fight the system with all the puny little guns in the world, and hopefully then you will all rise up and take control of your government peacefully by voting properly. Maybe then we can stop seeing 100 000 people starve to death every day while fat Americans throw food into the trash.

&gt;Yes. Some things are.

That is rich coming from an American who has probably lived a sheltered life of luxury. How would you know? I've been shot at twice in my life and I'm telling you that no matter how virtuous or whatever you think it would be to die for a cause, you are wrong.

&gt;Freedom from oppressive assholes is one of the main ones that come to mind right now. Live free, or die trying.

You have never been oppressed by the government in your life. The US government is way too busy oppressing brown people in other countries to oppress Americans. You act like you are fighting some kind of holy war against your own democratically elected government. Get some perspective. In Western and Northern Europe we don't all carry guns and there has not been a single oppressive government since the war ended.

&gt;Your delusion that your position is ""more mature"" is laughably immature... It's not about social maturity: Your position is of the UK. Mine is of the USA. It's that simple. Different value sets.

Yeah sure. If that makes you feel better, keep doing what you are doing.

,"The original movement was originally more libertarian themed, truly grass-roots, locally organized with no concerted collective platform, ideas or solutions.  The vast majority however supported Ron Paul for the 2008 election and decried the policies of both the republicans and the democrats seeing both as basically doing the same things just using different rhetoric to do it.

,"This is true, but for all practical purposes that means 100% coverage - that last &lt;1% is going to be pretty unreachable. Like I say - I've never been without signal.

Compared to the USA, Europe and the Middle East, Australia is basically phone nirvana. In other countries, It's basically *assumed* that phones don't work in high-rises or valleys or lifts. People often have areas of their house specifically designated for phone use. Phone providers advertise mini-network towers for you to install so that you can get coverage inside your own house (In AU, this would be seen as a startling admission of failure). You buy the phone depending on what city you're in most. We have nothing like that level of service - all the other providers just fall back to roaming on the Telstra infrastructure.

,"I did the same thing that you are thinking about.  Right after college, I packed up and moved away from the US.  In the last 15 years, I've lived in Australia, Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the United Arab Emirates.  But also, have had the opportunity to be semi-based to work and visit many other countries like Singapore, Philippines, Bahrain, Egypt, Thailand, and England.

My advice is it doesn't matter where you go, because you will gain such valuable expereince in life and learn about yourself.  You will push yourself out of your comfort zone and truly be a stranger in a strage land.  For some people that is frightening, but for others, it gives them a chance to shine and thrive.

Asia is an incredible place, and with your US passport, you will have little to no problem visiting any of these countries.  It doesn't really matter (initially) if you have a work visa or not.  Many people visit a country, make the contacts and connections, and then are able to secure employment while they are there.  Looking for a job online does not compete with meeting people in person.

Now if you are just coming out of school, that can be hard if your funds are limited, so be prepared.  If you choose to take that route, you need to schedule, plan, research companies, call and make contacts, set-up interviews or meetings before you go over.  Make use of your schools alumni network and try to contact alumni in each city, country you visit.  You already have a connection with them, so work that to it's full potential.

Also, work your family network too.  Friends of friends through work, church and social activities may have connections in where you want to visit.  Also, if it is coming through a family connection, they may offer to put you up, temporarily.  If this happens, be nice, bring a gift, offer to take them to or make dinner, and stay only 2-3 days.  You don't want to wear out your welcome.

As for countries to live in...if you only speak English, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, England, Canada, Philippines, UAE, and Bahrain are all good destinations.  Place like Australia, New Zealand, England and Canada offer a certain comfort level with many of the customs and experiences of home, so you don't go into total culture shock.  Plus you're the one with the cool accent.  It helps to meet people when you go out. 

For Hong Kong, Singapore, UAE, Bahrain or Philippines...you don't have to speak Mandarin, Cantonese, Malay, Arabic or Tagalog to get around, but these are the next steps up in culturally diverse destinations.  You can get around easily, but there are things you would never see in the US, and prepare to have your mind blown.  You will have culture shock at some point.

My wife and I don't have kids, so we've never looked at the education system in any of the countries.  But international schools tend to be expensive.  So in any salary discussions you have, see if you can have an education allowance for your kids in there.  Even if you don't have kids, make sure it is in there.

I've never been a stickler for standard of living...you can make your own standard of living.  If you are from Texas and used to wide open spaces and big houses....Hong Kong and Singapore might be an issue for you...but that being said, there are plenty of open spaces for you to go out in.  The UAE on the other hand is nothing but wide open spaces.  Sure the summertime is brutal, but the rest of the year is great.  

A lot of these are generalizations though.  Here is a list of a few countries and some of my thoughts on Good and bad.

Australia: Good - Great People, wonderful weather, huge diverse country, great beach, active scene   Bad - High taxes, travel to/from can be very long and expensive

China: Good - Incredible Culture and history, people very willing to engage you/meet you/make frineds with you, develop close group of friends very easily (expat community),  a dynamic a growing society, very fast paced, can be very inexpensive (based on how you live)   Bad- Polution, too easy to only associate with only expats, human rights issues, censorship, 

Hong Kong: Good - easy to get around, great public trasnport, very easy to get out of city into countryside, great party scene, wonderful food, mountains in the middle of the city, very international culture, convienant hub for travel around world, inexpensive broadbad, low tax rate (16-18%)  Bad - Pollution, crowded, small apartments, expensive apartments, 

Singapore Good, same as hong kong without the mountains and even more culturally diverse.  Apartments are larger and less expensive.  Bad - Censorship, strict laws, a bit crowded (not as bad as HK)

United Arab Emirates - Good: 0% Tax, wide open spaces, beautiful scenery, high salaries, large and inexpensive places to live, rapidly developing, great infrastructure, available jobs (depending on skill set), great hib for European and Asian travel, and you can drink alcohol here and eat pork.   Bad - Zero tolerance on drinking a driving US$5,000+ fine and 30 days in Jail), Zero tolerance on drugs (4 years in prison - minimum) Social pecking order (do not upset the locals, insult Islam etc).  Always need to be aware and act/dress within the confides of local considerations.  If you generally are well behaved, you shoudn't have any problems.

Don't be a hypocrite.

,"The gulf oil spill is a glorious cluster fuck of corporate greed and lax regulations.

Chernobyl was a glorious cluster fuck of party pride and lax regulations. After all, it was a bomb plutonium production plant. Most Europeans received an extra 1-5% to their annual background radiation exposure for a decade. It's still measurable in some isotopes. Life in Chernobyl is flourishing despite some radiation. To scale things, Chernobyl wasn't much worse than one of the about 600 atmospheric nuclear tests executed in the 50's and 60's. Yes it was bad for the people within 100 miles of ground zero and the firemen who died from exposure but mostly the effects on the larger population were and still are negligible.

Nuclear waste is cool after about ~400 years. In ~1000-10000 years it's about as radioactive as natural uranium. Doesn't make it safe or non-toxic but it's definitely not the glow-in-the-dark material from comic books. A majority of the radio isotopes decay in the first millenia and the remaining ones will be a problem for hundreds of thousands of years.

This mindset also seems to survive longer than others: I've known muslim families who never go to a mosque and who drink alcohol but would never allow their daughter to date a non-turk (or muslim).

And this is not something that is merely a function of their economic backgroud (poor). Islamic countries are mostly far far behind western countries with it comes to womens rights and treatment of women and immigrants from those countries import this culture with them.

,"Many of these figures are ripped and horribly modified from a book called ""When My Grandmother was a Child"".  I do love this book, however, the OP's stats don't concern the 1910s but rather the 1890s.

http://www.amazon.com/When-My-Grandmother-Was-Child/dp/0525941053

Another problem is that some of these ""stats"" have been modified from the original book in order to appeal to internet users who don't really read.  For instance the original book made no reference at all to marijuana, heroin and morphine being available over the counter (they weren't), but rather to opium being available (and widely used) over the counter.

I'm pretty sure Canada never passed a law that prohibited poor people from entering into their country for any reason.  In fact, we gave away free land to the poorest Eastern Europeans to help grow our prairie provinces.  But I could be wrong.

Other stats from the OP's post have had extra items added that aren't sourced.  For instance, this stat:

&gt;More than 95 percent of all births took place at home . Ninety percent of all Doctors had no college education.

is in the book, but somebody added the extra part at the end about ""so-called medical schools, many of which **W**ere [sic] condemned in the press and the government as 'substandard.'""

EDIT:  Oops, I just opened up my copy of ""When My Grandmother Was a Child"" and I found out that I was wrong about the marijuana, morphine and heroin.

,"Your perception of what current US immigration is contributing to itself is flawed as well.

Christopher's FB response, albeit generalized, is true.  Immigration from 1965 and on was mainly realized in the Universities where these immigrants were granted visa's to further their studies.  What impact has this had?  More people graduating with Masters' and PhDs' than rest of the world.  In turn, various industries have prospered (mainly sciences and engineering).  This is a lot different than the 1920s and prior immigration where southern and eastern Europeans flooded into the eastern coast.   Here are some numbers from the government from the 90s in terms of #s of foreign born graduates: http://nces.ed.gov/pubs98/web/98042.asp

You are right, this is America in 2010, in 1776 US had both German and English as languages and English barely won out as a de-facto language.  All the Indian immigrants I know speak english and can hold a conversation well.

Contributions by immigrants, especially from the Indian sub-continent can be extracted by various statistics detailing the amount and percentages relating to education.  Asian (includes Chinese, Korean, etc) immigrants account for around 4% of the population, but looking at who is graduating from our universities is humbling.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Higher_education_in_the_US_by_race.svg

Placing an unwarranted hatred towards immigrants is nothing new.  Historically all the various groups of immigrants have been exposed to it.  Guess its the Indians' turn.

Only thing I hope is for perspective and intelligence to take hold before ignorance of the issue.

&gt;The greatest differences between men and women were found in responses about sexual violence. 14 percent of the young women had in the past year have been victims of some type of sexual abuse, which was three times more than the equivalent number of men.

According to Wikipedia, 18% had ""foreign origins"" and more than 50% of them are from Western nations:

&gt;The foreign-born population in 2008 consisted mainly of Europeans, particularly those from other Scandinavian countries: 56.9% of the foreign-born were European, with 21.0% being Scandinavian. Asia accounted for 28.2%, Africa 7.1%, South America 4.8%, and North America 2.2%. The largest single country population represented was Finland at 13.7% of the foreign-born (1.9% of the total population); other countries with 5% or more of the foreign-born population were Iraq (8.5%), Yugoslavia (5.6%), and Poland (5.0%).[7]

&gt;Immigrants are overrepresented in Sweden's crime statistics. During the period 1997-2001, 25% of the almost 1,520,000 offences were committed by people born overseas, while almost 20% were committed by Swedish-born people with a foreign background. Those from North Africa and the Middle East were overrepresented.[2]

And:

&gt;Why would Swedes get their news from a source written in English, and that only regurgitate a selection of what the Swedish mainstream media writes about?

Your first link states that numerous groups are linking rape with immigrants and are actively disseminating flyers about this through the country. That would be very peculiar, if there weren't some kind of link to this?

Your first link also states:

&gt;The first thing that should be emphasized with regard migrants and crime is that there is not, and never has existed, no official statistics to show how it relates to crime of immigrants in Sweden. The factual knowledge is mostly based on a comprehensive study covering the period 1985-1989. Half a decade later (1993) also conducted a smaller study at the Department of Criminology at Stockholm, which essentially showed the same result as the first investigation. None had therefore changed in substance. In recent years there has been some special studies on, individual types of crime such as gang rape, and murder personrån. The results of these studies have generally given the same results as the study period from 1985-1989. 
The factual knowledge that is available is not fresh. An important insight to the now increasingly vociferous debate on immigrant crime is that no one knows more in question than what was found in these studies decenniegamla soon.

Seeing as there was an study in 2005 about this, the one linked in the article I submitted, it seems that you're involved in intellectual dishonesty. 

While your link was published in late 2006.

* People don't blindly fallow science without questioning.

* People don't listen to doctors blindly almost nobody does but when people do listen its because they understand the medical science is a study thats been going on for hundreds and thousands of years, and doctors might no better than ur gut.

* NOBODY thinks the government has all the right answers or for that matter most of the right answer

* i agree here people need to shut up about there beliefs theistic or not.


* Again its just like doctors. An expert isn't isn't some chump who says he's the best. He or she is someone who has studied a field that has likely been evolving for a long time. It can probably be backed up by reason and logic. 


* I kinda agree here. But sources can be important especially to fight off B.S.

* Most Americans of a mature adult age understand that they have good lives here and that Europe is just another nice place that's not much better or worse than the U.S. The people who complain about the crappiness of the U.S. are usually angsty teens who don't know what there talking about. 

* Capitalism can be evil. As we have seen recently some capitalists are very evil. But with bits of socialism thrown in like we have in America it can work well. (i'm pro-the little bits of socialism we have thrown in btw) Also there is an enormous amount of poverty and famine in the world, capitalism can't make that claim but it can claim 
responsibility for creating a lot of it. 

* Your anti-intellectualism is very frightening and you should do some deep thinking about it. 

* Hey i won $50 by being better at rhyming than my classmates. But seriously it's an important part of our human culture but i see you were just being funny.

* Women and Men are equal in intellectual ability. You could argue one is more emotional than the other but in the long run they are equal there. Physicly we are made a bit different in terms of bone structure and muscle mass. But you cant sum up all men as grunt work-worthy, and all women as fragile. Because that just is not true.

* I don't know much about this. But I do think that people should be chosen for a job purely by there ability to do it. However I'm sure there are some employers out there that will but race (or all the other stuff it covers) before ability and thats why affirmative action exists.

* Most that want it banned want that because they understand the immense hard they can cause. I don't think people are anti gun because they are afraid of getting shot themselves but rather anyone getting shot.

,"Or not




&gt;It was thus with Rwanda. The Tutsis had been elevated to a false position of power by Belgian colonists, based on the perception that they had more Caucasian-looking features than the Hutus. This made enemies of two groups who had traditionally coexisted without conflict.

&gt;These unnatural conflicts have always been created by non-indigenous people. Even in America, war between Native American tribes began when people were removed from their land, and suddenly had to compete with other tribes for space to exist. For example, the Indian Removal Act in Kansas saw forty different tribes moved into one small area, where they of course began to act out the colonial myth of “ancient tribal conflicts” to compete for survival.

&gt;We see the ongoing legacy of this myth in our own remote Indigenous communities in Australia. In many places the missionaries and police elevated certain families, clans and language groups to the top of an alien hierarchy, usually based on ideas of “racial superiority” due to certain groups having mixed with European or Islander peoples. These families still dominate communities today, based on such racist colonial criteria. Naturally, this breeds resentment and conflict that builds to violent clashes in the Aboriginal community.

,"Wow - never expected so many upvotes.

Ok long story version. This is from my heart and may be important for those who have the same brief chance at happiness, so excuse me please, those redditors who are immersed in cynicism (as I once was).

I had three months off to travel the world.You get this in Oz if you work seven years for same company, its called long service leave.

I go to London and on first day I went to big ben. I want to get the standard tourist shot - me and BB (cheezy but I am an australian and it is the other side of the world!). Was about to ask this guy to take my photo and he lay down on the grass and shut his eyes. 

I turned  to the nearest person. It was a girl reading a paper  and asked  her to take my photo. Got talking to her. Her first day in London too. We decided to have a look around and got lost as both of us  have terrible sense of direction, spent the day immersed in laughter and saw lloyds building about 10 times unintentionally. She was Quebecois and spoke hardly english. Never the less had a blast.

Agreed to meet at Big Ben next day. Next day,  I'm standing there and thinking, ""who is that beautiful girl waving at me""... Turned out to be the girl from the day before. To be honest the first day I hadn't really though much about her looks as I was jet lagged to hell and  thought it was just a few hour wander around london before we went our separate ways. 

She'd come to london to learn english, ended up running away with me and we travelled all over europe, living in a tent and surviving on pancakes and cheap wine. After three months of sunshine and adventure, we parted as she had to go back to quebec to study and finish her degree. I had career and masters to finish on other side of the world. I had never had three months of my life that were filled with so much happiness and felt very lucky to have shared this time together with someone so special. 

Try as I might, I couldn't get her off my mind. All my friends said 'forget it, just a holiday romance - it would never work in real life'. I talked to others who'd tried to rekindle these sorts of romances and it had failed. The time had been so great that I didnt want to spoil it with some clumsy attempt to recapture the magic. After all 9-5 is very different to hanging out in france and spain.

About a year later I got a lump in my side.  I was diagnosed with aggressive cancer. I remember sitting in the doctors surgery and thinking 'this cant be happening - I havent finished my masters yet!'. I was trying to joke with the doctor and he wouldn't smile and he told me that if it had got into my system I probably had one more year. This was a very dark period, but also it made me think very deeply about life, my priorities and how precious time is.

I had to go into  hospital and have the thing cut out immediately. Lay in bed afterwards and vowed that if I made it through I would track the girl down and ask for her hand in marriage. Long story short, I made it through.

So I sent a postcard to an old address she gave me . Someone read the back of it and realised it might be important and got it to her.

Well, she said 'Yes""

We have now been together for ten years, still the most amazing woman in the world and as beautiful as when I first met her. We still have no sense of direction and as a result have got wonderfully lost all over the world together.

This is the reason for my reddit name - because on the front of the card I sent her was a picture of me holding a sign saying 'risk everything'

I dont know why it is that some get the chance to meet someone so special. I wish it could happen to everyone.

I disagree though. At least in the context of the study, ""I will"" was something that simply had to be done, with no rationalization behind it, while on the other hand, those who were in the ""will I?"" were actually in the position to explore such a rationalization

,"Valid point. What is the path of ""boat people"" after being labelled that for the first year? They would change status to immigrant or be deported.

Asylum seekers (without visas) generally arrive by plane (~90%) and a very few arrive by boat. So segregating out ""boat people"" isn't helpful. And as has been pointed out elsewhere, people arriving by boat are far more likely to be accepted as legitimate asylum seekers and given immigration status than those arriving by plane.

The population of Australia should be chopped into immigrant and born in Australia, which isn't exactly right, but should do for now.

In 2006 there were 4.4 million Australians who were born overseas, ~20% of the population. Shading 20% of the Australian population as 
""born overseas"" would make certain sanguine necked residents rather uncomfortable. But consider that over half of these would be from NZ, UK or Europe.

How many of these overseas birthers were originally asylum seekers? Well that shouldn't particularly matter as asylum seekers are legally considered immigrants with valid grounds to be classified as such. Can't find the numbers anyway so I am just going to guess at 100,000 over the last 40 years.

Of course, the first fleet were immigrants arriving from overseas, most likely without valid Australian visas.

If we get rid of the people born overseas then we can kiss both Abbot (born London) and Gillard (born Wales) both good bye ... hmmm. Not a bad thought.",1278423634,c0tm9o9,False,of Portland,neoporcupine,1426368588,0,t5_2qh8e,0,True,1,0,t1_c0tm9o9,False,t1_c0tm5qq,1,t3_cmcue,,australia
