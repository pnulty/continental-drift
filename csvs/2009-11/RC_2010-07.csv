http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA#Structure


FIFA is made of CONCACAF (N.A, Carribean), UEFA (europe), CONMEBOL (S.A.),  CAF (africa), AFC (asia and Australia), OFC (new zealand and pacific islands)

FIFA - World Cup, Club World Cup, Confederations Cup (nations), and replicas of this stuff at youth and women's levels.


CONCACAF - Gold Cup (nations), Champions League (winning clubs), Superliga (lesser clubs)


UEFA - Euro Cup (nations), Champions League (winners), Europa Cup (lesser clubs)


CONMEBOL - Copa America (Nations), Copa Libertadores (clubs), Copa Sudamericana (lesser clubs..thats debatable)


CAF - African Cup of Nations (nations), African Champions League (clubs), some other shit


AFC - Asian Cup (nations), Asian Champions League (clubs), other shit. 


Oceania - Polynesia Cup (nations), Oceania Champions League (clubs)


Each nation has a league (and possibly lower level leagues), and a cup, and sometimes additional cups. The league is always regarded as the most important thing to win, and the Cup usually is lower on the priority list. 


The USA has MLS for its league, and the US Open Cup for it's cup. Winners of the league (MLS Cup) and the shield (best regular season record) get automatic qualification to the CONCACAF Champions League. MLS Cup runner up and the US Open Cup winner get to play into that tournament with a qualifier. The next 4 MLS teams get to play in the less glamorous SuperLiga. Winning CONCACAF Champions league gets you to the FIFA Club World Cup. Superliga just gets you money.


All in all, it's pretty awesome that any team from anywhere can end up world champions by proving it. Samoa FC could win the Oceania champions league, and then pull off miraculous upsets to beat major South American and European competition to win the Club World Cup. 

Theoretically, you could start a team in the USA with your friends, miraculously win the US Open Cup, play in the CONCACAF Champions League, win that, and play in the FIFA Club World Cup. ",1277942509,c0t9cgs,LA Galaxy,jameseyjamesey,False

Winner noticed that these bridges are built very low, and that only automobiles could pass under them. Public buses, on the other hand, cannot pass. Having grown suspicious, Winner took a closer interest in Moses and his bridges. The situation was soon cleared up: Moses had intentionally had his bridges built so low to keep typical users of public transport, at that time the poorer strata of the population and especially blacks, away from the beaches and to reserve these for the white middle classes. Decades after Moses’ death, the resentments of a singular person are  then incorporated in his bridges as an ongoing social injustice ...

What I mean is that the American government (central bank + treasury) is the issuer of its own currency. This is meant as something distinct from a user of currency. So for instance households, countries, banking sector, etc. are all users of American dollars, they can only obtain American dollars when the American government spends (either through central bank operations or treasury spending). 

&gt;But as long as it REQUIRES foreign bond purchases in order to sustain it's public spending (which it does) then it is vulnerable both to the willingness of foreigners to lend it money AND the willingness for foreigners to hold it's currency. 

There are a few points here:

Firstly, you’re assuming again that the American government is a user of American dollars. 

Secondly, the money you are referring to is American dollars which is a liability on the consolidated government’s balance sheet (central bank + treasury). As it is a liability on the balance sheet (specifically the central banks) this means that the government is the issuer, as liabilities imply a source. 

In a monetary system characterised by floating exchange rates and fiat currency it makes no sense to state: ‘the government issues bonds to collect its own liabilities in order to finance its spending’. You are essentially saying that the government needs to ‘save’ its own liabilities in order to spend, which is nonsensical. 

If this is the case then what role do bonds perform in our monetary system and why does the government issue them at all?

To answer this question, it’s important to understand that transactions to and from the government have upon the private sectors balance sheet:

Governments spend by either crediting private sector bank accounts or be issuing cheques. In either case, net financial assets are created for the private sector. This asset takes the form of either currency or reserves.

Government taxation occurs by the government debiting private sector bank accounts. This destroys reserves and currency (net financial assets). 

The implication from this should be clear: government spending and taxation without any other operations affects the reserve position of the private sector. If government spending leads to an excess reserve position then the overnight interest rate will fall below the central bank’s target rate and to zero, as banks who try to sell their excess reserves only have other banks with excess reserves to sell to. As banks will always try to minimise their holdings of reserves (above any minimum legal requirements and any liquidity preferences) the overnight rate will therefore drop. The opposite of this will occur when the government taxes, the reserve position may be  deficient and banks who are deficient in reserves will continually bid up the price as they can find no sellers. The overnight rate will increase. In either case, the overnight rate remains volatile and depends completely on the transactions to and from the government, this is known as the ‘reserve effect’. As the central bank loses control over its target rate it needs to implement operations which will reduce this.

Minimising the ‘reserve effect’ of government spending requires constant coordination between the treasury and the central bank, as the treasury informs the central bank of expected outflows and inflows. In instances where the flows will lead to the private sector having an excess reserve position a number of operations may be taken: debiting of tax and loan accounts and/or issuing of bonds. If you want me to discuss the former I can but to save time I will just discuss the latter.
The issuing of bonds by the government is a interest rate maintenance operation not a financing operation. When the government (central bank + treasury) issues a bond or any form of security the result is that the composition of financial assets within the private sector are changed. In other words, bond sales will lead to the private sector being debited an amount of reserves equal to the amount of the bond sale. The net result is that a financial asset will change from currency/reserves to a government bond and the reserve position of the private sector will be less the amount of the bond. This reduces the reserve effect and allows the central bank to maintain its target.

This is the case of all bond sales (by a government who specifies purchase of the bond with its own liabilities) regardless of who they are to. 

TL;DR: government spending can lead to excess reserves within the private sector. This can lead to the overnight rate falling to zero. Bond sales drain reserves allow the overnight rate to stay at the central banks target.

&gt;America has the worlds reserve currency but this makes it less vulnerable not invulnerable, countries go bankrupt when their currency is no longer trusted and there is a ""run on"" said currency which spikes interest rates and forces them to default (declare bankruptcy). 

Any country which issues its own currency and operates within a system of floating exchange rates and non-convertible currency can never default for operational reasons – it may default for political reasons but this is completely different.

&gt;If countries couldn't go bankrupt the IMF wouldn't have had to lend money too and get the economies on track of half a dozen different countries over the past 20 years.

The use of the word ‘money’ is ambiguous in our current monetary system money is always someone’s liability. The IMF cannot provide the American government with American dollars unless the American government spends first and therefore provides the asset for the private sector (as something distinct from the American government).

&gt;Explain to me why a country defaulting on it's debt (a country with it's own currency) is any different to an individual restructuring or entirely defaulting on a loan they've taken?

A country who doesn’t issuer their own currency or operates with fixed exchange rates or on a gold standard CAN default on their debt. In this instance the country is the user of the currency as it has to maintain a specific convertibility of its liabilities to another asset (gold, another currency, etc.) and is therefore comparable to an individual or firm, who are also users of currency. An example of such a country would be any country within the European Union (pending whatever institutional arrangements occur in regards to the current situation) and any state of any country (e.g. California). In this instance there is no difference between a country or an individual defaulting.

In the example you specified – a country with its own currency – the default would arise due to political reasons not due to operational reasons. An individual who is a user of currency would default due to operational reasons (e.g. insufficient cash flow). In other words a government which issues its own currency is never insolvent and cna never default due to insolvency, whilst an individual is a user and may default due to insolvency. 

I'd like to add that countries may be vulnerable to expectations. So if the market expected a particular country to default on its debt (despite being an issuer) there may possibly be volatility in long term bond rates. The next move would depend upon the government’s economic advisers and whether they understand the distinction between a user of currency and an issuer. If they did, the government would simply not issue the bonds and use another operation to drain reserves (as after all bonds are simply interest rate maintenance operations). So they could (in America) draw down tax and loan accounts or they could minimise the spread between the support rate and target rate – in fact they could make the rates the same, which would eliminate all excess reserves within the monetary system.

I got the youngest one who was from an eastern European country, she had only arrived for a week or so and spoke hardly any English. All the guys are having some fun with their girls, grabbing them and kissing them and whatnot. I had a GF back home, and I really didn't feel much need for any of that. So, while all the guys are entangled with their girls, I'm desperately trying to be nice to mine and keep a conversation, but it's impossible. I can see she's starting to wonder why I don't try to make out with her (everyone else is) or grope her or something.

Well the music was playing and there was no other guys at the club so I decided to leap from my seat and head for the strip pole. I wrap my hands around it and try to mimic the stuff you see in the movies, but Christ that stuff is hard. Seriously. Still, I'm having fun and the girls who were just sitting around with no one rush to me and start to dance with me. One or two get a little frisky and start to strip me. While I'm trying to keep my clothes on (but I really didn't care, I was having lots of fun) even most of the girls from our table flock to me. At this point dancing was pretty much over. I had way too many hands stripping me and I felt like a football player swarmed in by fans in the last match of a division-climbing season. When I got down to my briefs, I figured the other guys didn't really want to see the full monty so I clung on to them (the briefs) and ended the show. Everyone loved it, specially the girls.

Because of this, things like menstruation and sex drive can change from before she started taking it.  Is it via prescription where you live?  If so, she should check with the prescribing doctor - if you are worried, this is worthwhile anyway, because you should both have a reasonable understanding of what any medications you or she take work, and how the whole mechanism functions.

If you really insist, don't rush into things, plan carefully.

First of all, since you say you'd have $35k, it sounds like neither your house nor your 401k is particularly valuable. I don't know where you live but in this market it will be hard to cash out the full equity of the house if you can't afford to negotiate down a bit. 

If you do, use a tax adviser to help you settle your bill before you leave. You may stay gone a good long time but in old age you will need to come back to the good ol' US eventually.

Consider an alternative: keep the retirement in the bank and rent out the house with the help of a management company. Work for one more year, living in the cheapest apartment or room you can find - which should still be more comfortable, if less poetic, than European hostels and couch-surfing. Save up every dime you can, living the kind of life you would be living. If you're making $40k/year now you should be able to come out with $30k in the bank if you really push it.

Several studies have found that Oriental populations tend to have high mean IQs, strong visuo-spatial abilities but relatively weaker verbal abilities, as compared with Caucasian populations in the United States and Europe. The present paper reports data on these claims for 19 Korean infants adopted by families in Belgium. The children were tested with the WISC at a mean age of 10 yr. Their mean IQ was 118.7, the verbal IQ was 110.6 and the performance IQ 123.5. The results are interpreted as confirming those obtained from other Oriental populations.

The people pushing political correctness seem to me to almost always be liberal and frankly I find it childish the way so many people try to control the way I speak. I'm a caretaker for the mentally retarded and since I was a kid people have tried to change the way they refer them.

First it was mentally retarded. Descriptive, concise, understandable. Then you had kids calling each other 'retards' and the word got a negative connotation.

Then it was ""special"" - unfortunately, it was later deemed that the word was condescending and carried a negative connotation, most likely because us schoolkids began calling each other ""special.""

Then it was mentally disabled. But no - that was too mean too, because it carried a connotation that someone with a mental problem can't think. Then we changed it to ""developmentally challenged."" As far as I know, that's the accepted term. 

Seriously. This is fucking ridiculous. Everyone knows what the word ""retarded"" means and it's how people talk when among close friends anyway. Frankly, I find it offensive in the first place that they tried to change the word - people with mental retardation live incredibly challenging lives and don't get to experience the world the way the rest of us do. Most people can't imagine the lives that these people have had to lead. To take a word that denotes the challenges, the frustration, the disability of the people afflicted with it and try to flower it up by calling it ""developmentally disabled"" seems in a way disrespectful. 

""Retarded"" carries a negative connotation because being retarded is a horrible thing to live with. You can't change the reality by changing the language - if anything you separate society from itself.

Same with ""black"". ""Black"" is barely considered politically correct anymore - you're supposed to say ""African American"". When you or I see a black person we don't think ""there's an african american guy"", we think ""there's a black guy"", or even better ""there's a guy"". By pressuring people into using tongue twisters to refer to each other we've become afraid to talk to each other in a way that makes us feel comfortable. Just think about how the words make you feel - would you rather be in a room full of ""African Americans"" or ""black people"", or a room full of ""Caucausion/European Americans"" or ""white people""?

About your first two paragraphs:

As I wrote, your incentive to ""run"" the factory should be fulfillment (and survival) - making a profit to acquire exchange goods and to secure/enhance your standard of living are, looked down apon from the apogees, a mere mean to comply with this incentive, which boils down to reasoning and/of satisfying urges.

That said, productivity is not labor and vice-versa. Of course you can have an urge to clutter someone with resources to waste them however he/she/it wanted, but not doing so is not what the exclusion from the means of production means. If you write about ""wasting good factory space and raw materials producting a good that society did not proportionally value"", this for me implies one of two things.

First, it might mean that there are people who are excluded from means of production and cannot substitute these (making wasing factory space an issue to begin with), what subjugates them to the people who run the factory. Not anarchism.

Second, it might mean that there should be some institution to tell what to produce. Of course, to overcome problems of scarcity and waste, production has to be planned better, but command economy usually favors the opposite. Neither anarchism nor ancap.

It seems to me that you're writing about scenarios rampant in command economies like in former Eastern Europe (if state-run) or the fascist economies (if privately-run). That's not what anarchism is about.

&gt; Is this exclusion?

Depends, but (when not counting ""wasting good factory space and raw materials"") it's not exclusion from the means of production. Nobody is forcing you *not* to spend your time and resources on pretty dances, and there's no real mean of production other than yourself, which is unmerchantable to begin with.

In the perfect world, if you have a reason to produce something, you should not be forced to rely on others except if it does affect them - of course nobody should be forced to not help you either, we're a social species and favors tend to get returned. If it affects them (even by being a big enough project, inspiring them, feeling embarrassed for you, or affecting them in a not so benign way) you should have to convince them. Just like now, except without coercion. Or like ancap.

&gt; Knowledge is decentralized.

It is. But it tends to spread. I guess you're not one of the wannabe-geniuses who want to be technological/intellectual gatekeepers, because this essentially is creating monopolies and thus incompatible with the free market and thus ancap. Market players have to be at eye level, otherwise they're not free. Products don't. And if items of knowledge happen to be means of production, we're back at the topic of exclusion.

If we're talking about an economy of mutual benefit and symbiosis, the creators of knowledge should focus on creating knowledge as far as they tend to strive. Sharing this knowledge provides incentive for those who benefit from it to give something back to its creators. This again is incompatible with an economy that forces its participants to focus on short-term profits through market dynamics-induced coercion.

Given the foreseeable ubiquity of knowledge distributing technology and automation of physical production, the decentralization of knowledge becomes decentralization of knowledge in its egalitarian sense, leading to an individual's knowledge only being limited by time and motivation. Of course not everyone should be a factory manager: people are different. But that doesn't mean there should be a hierarchy or property (of productive means).

&gt; Some people shouldn't be overseeing supply shipments and some people shouldn't be down on the floor interacting with customers. I don't think that valuing individuals on an individual basis is unethical nor undesirable.

It's not unethical or undesirable to value individuals on an individual basis *for individual purposes*. But rating them on a universal one-dimensional scale is at least intellectually dishonest.

&gt; We're all only mortals.

Why ""only""?

&gt; I'm not even sure that those pesky diminishing returns would allow us to ever exceed resource availabilities, scarce as they are, anyways.

That's because you're holding on to archaic definitions of being human. But even if we should never allow ourselves out of the wasteful mammalian form we naturally occupy: given the necessary knowledge and will, [there's plenty to escape that vicious cycle](http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/resource.html) even for much more individuals than those that make up mankind today.",1278017751,c0tbqk4,,[deleted],True

It is in fact not a contradiction.  The idea of the [""white man's burden""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Man's_Burden) was a prevailing notion during the imperialist age.  The basic idea was, black people (and Indians, and Filipinos, etc.) are of a lower class; however, it is the moral (and Christian) duty of the white, ruling upper class of European nations to ""help"" them to ""advance their culture"".

For the majority of people I'd probably venture that this philanthropic viewpoint was simply a cover for racism, exploitation, etc.  However, some people actually endorsed it and believed in it.

TL;DR: it is possible to love someone while still considering them as lower than yourself.  The ability to do so is in my opinion one of the prime virtues of a good leader.

As a tangential aside, this is one of the many failings which Western democracy has imprinted on modern generations--the loss of gentrification means that people relate discrimination to bigotry automatically, and see discrimination as an inherently evil thing (almost a ""sin""?).  Discrimination is, by definition, simply deciding what things you want to associate with.  I have decided in my life that I only want to associate with intelligent, rational human beings.  I am discriminatory.  I discriminate against stupid people.  This is not a bad thing.  

And I do not HATE stupid people inherently...it's not their fault.  I may hate the things they do, but hating the people is pointless.

These Christians are discriminatory in their notion of what is ""good"" and what is ""sin"".  They are NOT bigots.  Nor are they hateful.  And that is not a contradiction.  So I guess not so tangential after all, but whatever.  ",1278020863,c0tbv6c,,Moridyn,False

While it seems you like sweet teas what I say might not be very interesting to you, but if your interested in teas I think you might find it interesting. I'm by no means an expert myself, have been interested for maybe a couple of months or so (but I tend to get sort of passionate about these things, heh).

Before going into besserwisser mode I'd like to emphasise that if you think what your drinking taste good and if your enjoying it your doing it right, no matter what anybody else tells you.

A common rule of thumb for many, not all, tea enthusiasts is that:
Strawberry teas and other teas with added ingredients to change the taste are usually considered to be of low quality. Since the one drinking it won't feel just the taste from the tea leaves the quality of the leaves isn't as important. Fully appreciating the quality of the tea leaves is also the reason why many enthusiasts (again, not all) prefer to drink their tea without adding sugar or milk to it. Also, milk and cream ruin a lot of the antioxidants in tea, if you care about such things (I don't).

Now, that said let's talk about different types of tea. The tea you and most people in the US and europe are drinking is called black or crimson (hongcha) tea. Black being the english tea term and crimson being what they call it in asia, the only reason this terminology matters is because lapsang, puerh, liu bao and a bunch of other teas are called black in asia (heicha) with no corresponding term in English.

Some different kind of teas:

**White teas** This is the closest you can get to ""fresh"" tea leaves. It has a very mild flavour and is usually only steeped for maybe 20 seconds or so (though many prefer steeping it for as long as three, four or even five minutes).

**Black teas (heicha)** These usually have a very strong, bitter by some standards, flavour and depending on how you steep them they can get as black as coffee! It's a very interesting type of tea and even if you might not like it I would recommend trying it sometime. A good place to start is a ripe puerh (as opposed to a raw puerh which is much lighter). As a beginner price isn't very important, you can get quite an ok puerh quite cheap.

**Crimson teas (hongcha)**, commonly called black teas. This kind is the one most popular in the west by far. It is commonly believed that the best crimson teas are the one grown in the Darjeeling region of India (now days there is also a lot of non-crimson darjeeling teas, but if it just says darjeeling it's usually crimson). I'm not very fond of these myself, but I do have one from darjeeling which I find very pleasing. They usually have a little fruitier taste then one might be used to, despite not having added flavours. Also, be aware that there are a lot of fake darjeelings on the market.

**Green teas** I've heard a lot of people who think this is the only kind of tea apart from crimson tea and the one most popular in asia. After having read a lot about tea I'm not sure, though I might be wrong here, that it is the most popular in asia though it's definitely *one* of the most popular. Being sort of a Japan freak most of my experience with green tea comes from Japanese sencha and matcha (ground tea, very interesting and highly recommended) and even then it's limited.

**Wulong teas**, often spelled oolong (same word, just different romanizations). This is probably my favourite kind of tea though I dare say it's one of the teas you will absolutely ruin if you add sweeteners to it. In my opinion it goes for most teas but wulong is special. ;-) Widely viewed as the most aromatic tea and I think the one that requires the most work and skill to make good (make, not brew). There's huge variation within the category of wulong teas but from what I've gathered it's usually large leaves rolled either to stick-like or ball-like shapes. The steeping is very beautiful as the leaf will usually fold out and if you've got a good tea you can sometimes get very pretty, unbroken and unbruised leaves from this. One cheap but good wulong I've found is the Wuyi Qilan (available [here](http://cgi.ebay.com/Wu-Yi-Qi-Lan-Organic-Rare-Orchid-Oolong-100g-3-5-oz-/230370195566?cmd=ViewItem&amp;pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item35a322386e) at the Dragon Tea House eBay store for $14 / 100g which lasts a long time). When drinking I usually make at least five or six steepings from each pot, sometimes more.

**Herbal teas or tisanes** These beverages are not tea as they do not contain the tea plant, but they are tea-like infusions of other herbs which may or may not have the same stimulating effect as tea. One of my favourites being the South American beverage Mate (from the plant Yerba Mate) which is VERY high in caffeine. The first time drinking it it pretty much made me dissy. Cooled mugicha or roast barley tea is a very popular summer drink in Japan which may take some getting used to but it's very cheap and very good once you get used to it. I like it a lot.

Finally, a tip which ought to suit your sweet tooth extremely well! I usually do not view this as tea, though I guess it really is, but it's super tasty. **Masala Chai**. Literally ""spice tea"" is an indian tea blend usually using crimson tea mixed with spices. The tea is then actually *supposed* to be boiled with milk, water and sugar. You can probably get an OK taste of this to see if it's your thing at the nearest Starbucks as it's very popular, often under the name ""Chai Latte"". My advice if doing it at home would be to have not too much but a good deal of white sugar and some whole milk. It's truly wonderful!

Hope you found my breakdown of different kinds of tea useful. You'll quickly notice that there's an entire science built around tea and it's literally impossible to even have tried all variations within a sub-type of tea. You can spend your whole life drinking different kinds of tea and still have more to learn!",1278045188,c0tcn7p,,kaminix,True

The Irish immigrants started appearing in large numbers in 1846 to 1855 running from famine. They flooded the eastern city seaboard, mainly Boston, Philadelphia, and New York. They were dirt poor, had little to no education, and immediately took on the hardest of manual labor, especially construction jobs.

by 1900 they had begun to monopolize public sector jobs and Irish employed by the government shot up until they eventually dominated it by 1930. By the depression in 1933, the Jews (watch out for a reddit shitstorm) began to challenge the Irish for these jobs. The Jews, who had been around for a long time, (Many fled from European antisemitism from the 1880's to the early 1900's)  but not had serious clout in the public sphere, began to usurp teaching jobs in the U.S.

By 1920, two million Jews lived in New York City, which became the worlds largest Jewish city. Just in time for the explosion of factory jobs.
Although many fled in poverty, in rags, it became easier for (SOME OF) the poor Jews to move up due to the ""well-to-do"" community already established. 

The Jews began to monopolize commerce and clothing industries, increasing the opportunity for mobility amongst (SOME OF) themselves.

By the depression, the educated, middle class Jewish community began to look for opportunities in the public sector, as I have previously stated. 

The Jewish-Irish tensions reached it's peak here in the 1930's, but gradually subsided without serious conflict as they found a common adversary: The blacks.

The lower class jews were still vying for the lower class jobs, of course, and this included retail, particularly that which was concentrated in Harlem. Jewish store-owners would sell to blacks, but preferred not to employ them, until protests (in the 1930's) 

There were eventually riots in 1943, and blacks burned down many Jewish owned establishments in Harlem. This conflict reached it's peak in the 1960's. 

Unlike the blacks, Jewish folk had rapid upward mobility, and with a dwindling Jewish working class, the Jewish employers began to look for workers. Finally, it was time to hire other people to work for them. And who did they turn to? The Italians, of course!

Reluctantly, Jewish owners eventually hired blacks after World War II. 25k African Americans worked as garment workers (up from 5000 only 10 years previous) and blacks began to move into the sector once filled by the Irish, and then the Jewish immigrants. During this time, few blacks moved into the public sector (Civil Rights weren't even a twinkle in the nation's eye at this point) 

Why did it take this long, even before Civil Rights? Weren't Blacks here first?

In 1890 Blacks comprised only 1.6% of New York City. By 1920, there were only 150k blacks in New York--3% of the city's population.

Blacks did benefit from the United State's shut-off of immigration during WWI, and they did occupy factory jobs, but by 1924, they had been displaced, predominantly into domestic service positions. 

It wasn't until 1990 that 35% of native-born blacks entered the pubic sector--even amidst continuing ethnic struggle. They also comprised a quarter of the city's population. David Dinkins was the first African American mayor of NY city, elected that year. 

There is a long history of ""inter-ethnic"" struggle in the United States.

The Cubans, did not begin to enter the nation in large numbers until the mid-late 20th century, and the Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, etc., even later.

 I hope a picture is coming together at this point.

You mentioned Koreans. I'll try to explain that one shortly, because at this point, I might as well get in front of a classroom and lecture while you sleep.

In the 1960's the U.S. once again liberalized it's immigration laws. The reforms tilted towards those with ""kinship ties"" to current residents. Another emphasis was the 1965 reform which allowed educated immigrants--engineers, doctors, nurses, jobs with high demand and short supply--priority. An influx of well-educated and highly skilled Koreans dominated that spurt. 

They ""took over"" (I'm getting lazy with my lingo at this point) small storefronts, nail salons, etc. By 1980, already a third of Korean Males were self employed.

Although smaller than the ""white immigrant"" populations of yore, the Korean immigrants were better able to utilize their connections in Korea to develop commercial activity.

Of course, once again, in the 1990's tensions peaked between the newly economically dominant Koreans selling to, but not hiring, blacks in their own neighborhoods. (The Koreans would hire other Korean immigrants).

There was a boycott of two Korean stores in the Flatbush area of Brooklyn. Hilariously (depending on your sense of humor) although theo customer base dropped off, the two stores were kept open for four months based on financial support from the organized Korean community.

Of course, this only touches on the history. You could take course after course after course over many years and still not understand the full picture of our history.

I felt like I wrote this story myself about my life. I married a Russian woman in Europe and brought her into the United States. We lived in Naples, FL for the first two years of our marriage. After a visit from an older Russian woman (who lived between NYC and Miami), my ex-wife ""needed"" us to move to Indianapolis. I fought it but she caused significant issues for me with my employer. After relocating to Indianapolis, she immediately starting hanging around with her new Russian friends. In December of 2003, she abandoned her family and flew to NYC to meet two Russian cousins she had been talking to a lot over the phone. She returned from this meeting five days later (in early January). She wasn't the same person when she returned. I had to take a 9mm handgun from her later that month when she tried to kill me with it. We lived in the same house after that -- but separate bedrooms. She had her own separate life away from me and the children. On the day she got her green card in March of 2005, she took both children and disappeared. I know the two cousins gave her a lot a money at different times to pay for her medical school. She was required to finish medical school and be ""available"" anytime for medical support to her new Russian friends -- gunshot wounds, etc. Most of her contacts had something to due with Fencing (sword fighting). This group of people were a little different that the ones she had been with before. These were Ukranians. She had been living in Indianapolis and working in a research lab at IUPUI until this story first broke. She disappeared with the children again. So far, I have not been able to find her or my children. There are a lot more than ten Russian spies operating in the USA. They have a massive network that is being to rival that of Israel.

Second, the secessionist movement in Canada could be a good starting point. The separatists here started in the 70s and have had two referenda to decide on whether to stay or not. Both times, it was voted down, but only narrowly. This has prompted a lot of debate, propaganda, threats etc... but all of these were peaceful. The net effect has been two things. 1) the political dynamics of the country changed since the separatists are a strictly regional party. All of the other parties pander to Quebec to try and buy Quebecer votes and any party that is successful will win the election. Until that happens we have minority governments (uphill battle to power requiring compromise). 2) Basically all of the grievances that began the movement have been addressed. Quebec has really clawed back a lot of 'states rights' and while separatism is no longer broadly popular (most people want it to go away), the parties that started it are popular.


As to logistics, projection, international relations etc... These are all on the negotiating table with the federal government, and in all likelihood it never gets to this stage.

&gt; Such an force is also often under trained, under provisioned and lack the dermination of a killer.

Not quite accurate. What you describe is a subset. ""Those who are forced into the fighting force"" is 100% correct. 

But lets look at, say, many of those in, say, German, Finnish armies of WW2.

Lacking consent? Don't think so. Certainly there were grumblers in the ranks, but those always exist and don't really matter if 80% are by-and-large ok with being where they are (not a lot of desertions from either military until it was obvious the war was impossible to win).

Will to defend their home country or ideals? Seemed quite abundant, considering the sort of odds the armies were willing to take on.

Under trained? I would dare say both armies (the Finnish basically being trained by a German trained officer core) were better trained than any other on the planet, something that Western historians agree with.

Under provisioned? Perhaps somewhat compared to the Western armies, though the higher training resulted in a kill ratio that STILL favored the Germans when fighting Western forces.

Lack the determination of a killer? They might be some of the only armies for hundreds of years that might have killed more soldiers than they mobilized themselves during the whole course of the war.

&gt; Sure, there were many fiercesome armies made mostly up of conscripts but how many of those were alive and well enough to resume their interupted lives when the conflicts were over? Depends on the length of the conflict but the usual rule was that it werent many that fit that description.

Of course lots get hurt, but it's curious how well for example the conscript happy Germany that got mauled so hard twice first managed to rise from ashes to make the whole world quake between 1923 and 1939 and then from even worse ashes to again dominating the European continent for all intents and purposes after WW2...

As to the atrocities of the 20th century, these were ordered by evil men, religious, atheist or indifferent.  Hitler and many (if not most) of his men were Roman Catholics, their belt buckles read ""Gott mit Uns"" (""God with Us"" in German) and his birthday was celebrated in Catholic Churches until his death.

Stalin and Mao were taking advantage populations that for centuries had believed that their leaders were more than just human.  Obviously their actions were evil, but you cannot charge atheism with these evil acts, they were power seeking acts designed to solidify a power base.  These men were no more evil than imperialist Christians that wiped out or subjugated native populations around the world, they just enacted their atrocities more recently, once reporting was better.

On the other hand, the wars in Europe from (lets be generous) 1000 C.E. to the early 20th century were largely religious conflicts.

""[Legally blind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindness)"" is not the same thing as ""unable to see"":

&gt;`In order to determine which people may need special assistance because of their visual disabilities, various governmental jurisdictions have formulated more complex definitions referred to as legal blindness.[2] In North America and most of Europe, legal blindness is defined as visual acuity (vision) of 20/200 (6/60) or less in the better eye with best correction possible. This means that a legally blind individual would have to stand 20 feet (6.1 m) from an object to see it—with corrective lenses—with the same degree of clarity as a normally sighted person could from 200 feet (61 m). In many areas, people with average acuity who nonetheless have a visual field of less than 20 degrees (the norm being 180 degrees) are also classified as being legally blind. Approximately ten percent of those deemed legally blind, by any measure, have no vision. The rest have some vision, from light perception alone to relatively good acuity.`",1278106613,c0tefou,,AnteChronos,False

I regard yours as an ""American view"", in that liberty and freedom of the individual is such a US cornerstone. Europeans, however, tend to view themselves as building a society together, and as having a debt to the state - ""a debt to the state"" being a synonym for ""a debt to each other"".

Americans tend to be critical of welfare and view the culture around it in a negative light (so much so that I've seen redditors posting to say that they're getting desperate and considering claiming it - *despite* the fact they've been out of work and eligible for welfare for months). Europeans have a pride in having their social programmes, and regard the use of them as a right.

There have been a few comments that have explained this better than I have time to right now. [This is one](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/cl1p5/sweden_ends_compulsory_military_service/c0tcwlt), but I'm sure there are others I can't immediately find, returning as I am to the thread after 8 hours.

There is a precedent for non-military conscription - in Germany conscientious objectors are obliged to work the hospital wards. A number of the German students I shared digs with at uni had done this (which is where I got the idea), maintained they'd had a good time doing it (""what parties we had!""), and stated that the German public health system would fall apart without it. Whether that last point is true or not, it's evidence that they took pride in their service. I believe that in Israel women may choose to do other services, rather than their 2-year military conscription - I chatted once with a girl who was going to work as a kind of teaching assistant or school advisor.

One thing I do believe is that our British society and public services are so fucked up that something fairly radical is needed in order to save them. The police routinely lie and believe that they're above the law, and the answer to that is not simply to impose harsh sanctions on them for such crimes - if we do that they'll just end up feeling like scapegoats, banding together to conceal the problems and we'll all end up worse from it. What we need to do is destroy the ""them and us"" mentality - not only will having members of the public more involved with them and seeing the problems they face help that, but it will also act as a check upon them.

Likewise we only ever see the National Health Service when we're ill or old, and it's too late then to improve it - the NHS's problems are too easily pushed out of our minds in daily life. There tends to be resentment in our society against the unemployed, blaming them for their circumstances, and this has led to the current freeze on benefits. I'm not saying it's a good thing for a teenage girl to have 2 or 3 kids before she's 20, but once she's made that mistake, there's no point in continuing to blame her for it. What we want is for young women who come from more privileged circumstances to work in social services for a while and see how hard it is to bring up kids on welfare, and the problems facing the poor. Hopefully they'll take that social awareness into their own life, politics and eventual child-raising.

We're humans - we make mistakes and shit happens. What we need to be doing is finding ways to help the unfortunate out of the holes that they have dug for themselves, or which life has imposed on them. And I don't think we can do that by standing back and being hands off. Britain is becoming far too much a blame culture, and that doesn't solve anything - what we need to have is a culture of helping each other, and I don't think it's unreasonable to say that young people should owe service to society within that framework.

Salvador Allende was the worst possible scenario for a Washington imperialist. He could imagine only one thing worse than a Marxist in power-an elected Marxist in power, who honored the constitution, and became increasingly popular. This shook the very foundation stones on which the anti-Communist tower was built: the doctrine, painstakingly cultivated for decades, that ""communists"" can take power only through force and deception, that they can retain that power only through terrorizing and brainwashing the population.
After sabotaging Allende's electoral endeavor in 1964, and failing to do so in 1970, despite their best efforts, the CIA and the rest of the American foreign policy machine left no stone unturned in their attempt to destabilize the Allende government over the next three years, paying particular attention to building up military hostility. Finally, in September 1973, the military overthrew the government, Allende dying in the process.
They closed the country to the outside world for a week, while the tanks rolled and the soldiers broke down doors; the stadiums rang with the sounds of execution and the bodies piled up along the streets and floated in the river; the torture centers opened for business; the subversive books were thrown into bonfires; soldiers slit the trouser legs of women, shouting that ""In Chile women wear dresses!""; the poor returned to their natural state; and the men of the world in Washington and in the halls of international finance opened up their check- books. In the end, more than 3,000 had been executed, thousands more tortured or disappeared.
Greece, 1964-74:
The military coup took place in April 1967, just two days before the campaign for j national elections was to begin, elections which appeared certain to bring the veteran liberal leader George Papandreou back as prime minister. Papandreou had been elected in February 1964 with the only outright majority in the history of modern Greek elections. The successful machinations to unseat him had begun immediately, a joint effort of the Royal Court, the Greek military, and the American military and CIA stationed in Greece. The 1967 coup was followed immediately by the traditional martial law, censorship, arrests, beatings, torture, and killings, the victims totaling some 8,000 in the first month. This was accompanied by the equally traditional declaration that this was all being done to save the nation from a ""Communist takeover."" Corrupting and subversive influences in Greek life were to be removed. Among these were miniskirts, long hair, and foreign newspapers; church attendance for the young would be compulsory.
It was torture, however, which most indelibly marked the seven-year Greek nightmare. James Becket, an American attorney sent to Greece by Amnesty International, wrote in December 1969 that ""a conservative estimate would place at not less than two thousand"" the number of people tortured, usually in the most gruesome of ways, often with equipment supplied by the United States.
Becket reported the following: Hundreds of prisoners have listened to the little speech given by Inspector Basil Lambrou, who sits behind his desk which displays the red, white, and blue clasped-hand symbol of American aid. He tries to show the prisoner the absolute futility of resistance: ""You make yourself ridiculous by thinking you can do anything. The world is divided in two. There are the communists on that side and on this side the free world. The Russians and the Americans, no one else. What are we? Americans. Behind me there is the government, behind the government is NATO, behind NATO is the U.S. You can't fight us, we are Americans.""
George Papandreou was not any kind of radical. He was a liberal anti-Communist type. But his son Andreas, the heir-apparent, while only a little to the left of his father had not disguised his wish to take Greece out of the Cold War, and had questioned remaining in NATO, or at least as a satellite of the United States.
East Timor, 1975 to present:
In December 1975, Indonesia invaded East Timor, which lies at the eastern end of the Indonesian archipelago, and which had proclaimed its independence after Portugal had relinquished control of it. The invasion was launched the day after U. S. President Gerald Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had left Indonesia after giving Suharto permission to use American arms, which, under U.S. Iaw, could not be used for aggression. Indonesia was Washington's most valuable tool in Southeast Asia.
Amnesty International estimated that by 1989, Indonesian troops, with the aim of forcibly annexing East Timor, had killed 200,000 people out of a population of between 600,000 and 700,000. The United States consistently supported Indonesia's claim to East Timor (unlike the UN and the EU), and downplayed the slaughter to a remarkable degree, at the same time supplying Indonesia with all the military hardware and training it needed to carry out the job.",1278123405,c0tez4h,,xoites,False

I was always known as *goochtek* and partner. The longest I was single in that time was 5 months and even then I was seeing people but nothing serious. 

Anyway, at age 27, I had quite a bad breakup with the girl I was seeing for around a year. I was devastated so I decided to take some time for myself and, to use an old cliché, I needed to find out who I was. I ended up spending 2 months in Europe (I'm from Australia) and had a blast. I met so many people and had such a great time that when I finally came home I didn't want to be with anyone. I just wanted to do the single thing for a while. I had offers for relationships but I stuck to my guns and kept the promise I made to myself. 

Well, fast forward a year and people started questioning why I have been single for so long. The ""taking time for myself"" line was getting tired. I still wanted to keep it up because I had been bettering myself during this time too. I had paid off all of my debt, got a promotion at work, bought a small house and remedied a lot of my bad habits. I still felt like I wanted to be single and that no one would be able to change my mind. 

Fast forward again to 2 months ago. I signed up for online dating because I just wanted to meet some new people but wasn't really looking for anything serious. I received a few emails from various women but wasn't that keen. I ended up meeting a few of them for dinner/drinks. I clicked with one more than the others but I wasn't really overly interested and turns out she was feeling the same. I ended up going overseas again for a few weeks and when I came back the girl who I'd seen the most of contacted me and wanted to catch up. I accepted and we had dinner. Turns out that we were both in a bit of a slump the month before and this time around we ended up having a great time. We got on like a house on fire. We have now been seeing each other for a few weeks and it's been pretty great. I'm glad I took the step but I can tell you that I definitely needed that time to be single.

In general, the stripper's job is to approach you as an ATM machine, and her goal is to discover your pin number. Once one finds the emotional chink in your armor, not only will she attempt to drain you of all your cash, she will attempt to have you purchase funny money (house dollars) on your credit card. There is nothing funny about funny money. I repeat, do not get the funny money.

Hang out for a while before you commit to any lap dances. This gives you a chance to survey the entire talent pool, a lot of the girls are often hanging out in the back. You don't want to waste your precious $$ on a girl that isn't your type.

Don't waste a girl's time by letting her sit down and talk if she's not your type. Tell her you're ""just hanging out right now"" or ""taking a break"" if she asks if you want a lap dance.

Try to avoid the Eastern European girls. They are money-centric robots, and generally give horrible lap dances.

If she's cute and not hustling you too hard or she's just hanging out, it's ok buy her a drink.
Just don't let her order a bottle of champagne. 

Keep track of how many dances she gives you. Most girls are honest, some are not.
Some girls won't tell you if they have started another dance, and at $20 a pop that can add up fast. If you're not sure, ask.

In many clubs light touching is usually acceptable, she'll let you know when you've crossed the line. Respect the line. 

If you are sitting at the stage, always tip. $2-3 is fine. If you like what you see and want to get a lap dance from her give her $10 and ask her to come and visit when she's done. If there's a bunch of dudes trying get her attention you'll most likely win out.

If you are watching any girl dance on stage from a distance, you should tip her a buck or two. It's a fair trade. You're getting something out of it, so should she.

Break her out of her hustler mode, treat her like a person not an object. You'll get better dances if she can connect with you.

She doesn't need to be told that she's ""hot"" or that she has ""great tits"", she knows this already.

Don't forget to make eye contact with her when she gives you a dance.

If you have any massage skills, offer one up. Strippers are a mess, on many levels.

The VIP/ Champagne room is often a waste of money, but it can depend on the club and the girl.

That should get you started.

Be charming. Have fun ;)

This is why, for example, under Hale until R and R [1991] spousal status was an affirmative defence to rape in England and Wales, and similar defences existed until the latter half of the 20th Century in Canada, the United States, and other common law countries. Women certainly had some rights, but they were very limited compared to their fathers and husbands who largely exercised dominion in law if not necessarily in practice.

If you go back to Roman law, legally women weren't considered full adults and retained a sort of legal guardian who had to approve all property, business, and legal decisions by the women; the same thing applied to males, but only before they came of age. Of course Rome was actually fairly good to women in practice because the guardians weren't required to be authoritarian with their rule, but the level of liberality waxed and waned throughout the Republic and Empire, largely based on the prevalent social mood of the day. Being free as a woman in any meaningful modern sense certainly wasn't guaranteed, and even at times when the regime was generally liberal that didn't stop individual guardians being strict or miserly. Keep in mind, before dismissing this as being from far antiquity and thus irrelevant, that Roman law formed the basis of the legal systems of most of continental Europe and thus their colonial assets, and while specific points of law were often altered the general tone remained the same, including on women's rights.

From an Amazon review:

*Perhaps the greatest book by one of our greatest historians, The Discoverers is a volume of sweeping range and majestic interpretation. To call it a history of science is an understatement; this is the story of how humankind has come to know the world, however incompletely (""the eternal mystery of the world,"" Einstein once said, ""is its comprehensibility""). Daniel J. Boorstin first describes the liberating concept of time--""the first grand discovery""--and continues through the age of exploration and the advent of the natural and social sciences. The approach is idiosyncratic, with Boorstin lingering over particular figures and accomplishments rather than rushing on to the next set of names and dates. It's also primarily Western, although Boorstin does ask (and answer) several interesting questions: Why didn't the Chinese ""discover"" Europe and America? Why didn't the Arabs circumnavigate the planet? His thesis about discovery ultimately turns on what he calls ""illusions of knowledge."" If we think we know something, then we face an obstacle to innovation. The great discoverers, Boorstin shows, dispel the illusions and reveal something new about the world.* ",1278167508,c0tfu5d,,AMerrickanGirl,False

Per capita? Lets start with Norway for the countries of substantial size (Luxembourg et al hardly count).

&gt; [EU] also have a substantially larger population than the US. Nearly 3x the population. 

This is where I really start wondering whether debating with you is meaningful. US population is 309.6 million (2010 est) and EU population is 501.2 (2010 est). Somewhere along the line you're making an *enormous* mistake about your numbers, be it US, EU or division.

&gt; So they have vastly less ""surplus capital"" than does the US.

First of all that's a very complicated discussion in reality, and I'm not sure I'm going to engage to it with someone that thinks EU has nearly double the population it actually has (930 million vs the actual 501 million).

&gt; You define freedom rather strangely

I would make a bold claim that most people agree that people in prison are *not* free.

&gt; But those freedoms do not map to actual freedom as defined in the liberal tradition.

How would you treat victimless crimes? Or how would you think good old Liberals of back when would treat them? By throwing 3 million people in to jail? (Which, according to my freaky European definition, makes them ""not free"")

Also... am I wrong to think it's not particularly free that I can't enjoy a beer in a car I'm not driving (even if it's moving). Perhaps Liberal Tradition thought that this was clearly a crime and shouldn't be allowed? (It's not allowed in US as I understand, but certainly haven't heard of it causing problems in most places in the EU)

&gt; Also -- putting people on welfare costs far less than does incarcerating them.

Well if we ever get some more ""surplus capital"" we can upgrade from this welfare shit to throwing our people in to jail, like a proper developed country. ",1278170175,c0tfwe3,,Delheru,False

&gt;There is one small problem with his account of the story however. Auschwitz was liberated by the Soviets, not the Americans. OUCH! His campaign’s response was to say that he, and here is that word again, “misspoke”. Obama apparently meant that his uncle helped to liberate a different camp.

&gt; That is where one other little problem comes to light. Barack Obama’s mother was an only child, so Obama didn’t even have any American uncles.

It doesn't just hurt them. It hurts us too. There are much fewer jobs to pick from because everything is made elsewhere and all the shops are dying off leaving you with wal-mart.

If we pay more for clothes then we might get our jobs back which means we could get paid more. Buying $2 shirts isn't going to make them better off or allow them to save enough to become rich. It will just remove your employment options and put you at the mercy of the rich even more so. I just can't believe so many people are blind to this fact.

As long as you don't buy over priced fashion clothes (which imo are poorly made in a lot of instances) you should make out well. I would say I probably spend less on clothes than a lot of my friends despite paying more.

They are significantly different from the Europeans who arrived at the beginning of the 20th century, and the Asians who arrived 50 years earlier to work on the railways. Back then, there were no social programs available to be exploited. It was necessary to work just merely to survive. So those immigrants came and they worked hard, they contributed to society, and made America what it is.

The later migrants, however, were able to take advantage of the many social programs put in place after the Great Depression. They had no incentive to work. They had no incentive even to fit in with American society. They formed enclaves, and turned large portions of many Californian cities into gang-run hellholes. They had kids, who grew up in poverty, and thus turned to crime early on.

The social burden of these illegal aliens is huge. It has caused extreme pain for the Californian economy. It's not a problem unique to California or to migrants from South or Central America. It'll be a disaster any time you have a large portion of the population living off of the hard work of the rest of the population, especially when the leeches don't contribute positively in any way.

When I was a kid, I used to go to summer camps (boy scout style, only atheist/apolitical). The camp was in a densely wooded area in the middle of nowhere (in European terms, so the closest town etc. was just some 20 km away but the only way to get there was on foot on a field trip), it had no electricity, no brick-walled buildings (we slept in tents and when we needed to build a tool shed or something, we had to make it out of logs), we had to draw water from a well and haul it to the field kitchen in 50-litre barrels on a wheelbarrow, when we needed wood for cooking, we had to go to the forest and fell a tree, we bathed every day in a creek and once a week we heated up water to wash our landry (by hand) and ourselves, we took turns keeping night watch and kitchen service. We routinely used knives, axes and saws and of course, minor injuries were pretty commonplace - the medical care we had was an old hospital nurse and an army medic.

There were some 70 kids of both sexes aged 5 - 15 and bullying of the youngest was widespread. Not the downright evil kind though - more like the bullying in the military when you're bullied until you prove your worth and then are taken for equal no matter how weak, small, young or different you are. I was 7 when I was there for the first time and the first week I was thrown in the nettles or being drowned in a creek countless times.

It was staffed by some 15 people of both sexes (mostly college kids, plus some people in their thirties) who took part in all the activities, games etc. with us. It was headed by a male (OMG), who was a an army NCO of some sort by occupation.

The whole thing took 24 days and I went 7 times (I think). First week or so I despised it, then I thought it was OK, then I loved it.

The reason I'm writing all this is that when I was telling this to an American acquaintance of mine, he was absolutely horrified and couldn't believe this kind of stuff is even legal. As I've said, I'm in Europe, so sorry if I'm asking something that's obvious to you. But do summer camps like this ever take place in America?

There was not serious examination and interviewing of victims until many decades after the holocaust had ended (this being changed largely as a result of the 1961 Eichmann trial), this is not something that is doubted by historians or people engaged in the field of Holocaust Studies. Furthermore, while people originally thought this silence was a result of victims not wishing to share their past, historians like Konrad Kwiet have increasingly argued in recent times that this was more a response by the victims to a desire by Europe and America to forget or ignore the crimes perpetrated. 

Remember also, it was hardly advantageous emphasise or dwell heavily on the holocaust in the post war period, considering the tremendous failure of the Allies to offer shelter or protection to Jews in the build up to the war. Furthermore, the US' delay in entering the war is not cast in a good light in the face of mass genocide.



Edit- also 


&gt;The Holocaust was used as propaganda even before the war ended and the full extent was known.

""in early 1943, a Gallup poll asked Americans: ""It is said that two million Jews have been killed in Europe since the war began. Do you think this is true or just a rumor?"" Although the Allied leadership had publicly confirmed that two million Jews had been murdered, the poll found that only 47% believed it was true, while 29% dismissed it as a rumor; the remaining 24% had no opinion.... A major part of the reason for the public's skepticism was the failure of the American media to treat the Nazi genocide as a serious issue.""

Yet these differences are only superficial. For example, I am ""white"" (at least I look white, more on that in a minute), yet if you compare my genetic code of that to a random ""black"" person, there is a greater chance that I would share more of my genetic code with that person than another random ""black"" person would.

Then you have things like what race you are can vary from country to country. A person might be considered ""black"" in one country and ""white"" in another.
Also there are many people from India who are darker skinned than people from Africa, and vice versa.

Two more examples are me and my nephew. For me, 4 of my 8 great grandparents were native Americans. Which would make all of my grandparents ""half breeds"" and since all 4 of them were ""half breeds"" that would make my parents ""half breeds"" as well. And by the same logic, me. Yet, except for a relative lack of body hair, I look ""white"", as do my brothers and sisters. I have blond hair and blue eyes. And what about my ancestors? How many people of other 'races' might they have procreated with? My mom's family originally came from Scotland, and my dads family came from Ireland (in the 1700's). There is another interesting thing to consider when talking about race. Irish people in this country were not considered ""White"" at first, it was only very [recently](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Irish_racism#19th_century) that Irish people started being considered to be white. There was a LOT of racism against Irish people from ""white"" people. Including ironically for me [Scottish](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/2014961.stm) people.

My nephew, Is half ""black"" and half ""White"" (if that is what you could really call my sister). His hair slightly coarser than mine, (my hair is very fine). His hair is curly, but the curls are very loose. His skin tone is about halfway between my sister and his dad. He also has bright blue eyes. He is a beautiful child. What 'race' is he?

What if he marries and has a child with a half 'Asian' half 'Indian' woman? What 'race' would their child be?

&gt;That's quite impressive, if you think about it, and hard to explain if you believe it's based on a notion that's purely socially constructed.

While it may be a pretty good test generally but it is by no means foolproof. I had a friend who you would swear is a Native American yet he is half Korean and half ""White"".

At any rate, we are all a lot more similar than we are different. And the simple fact is that the word “race” has no biological definition, and it does not appear that one could ever be formed, at least not on the basis of genetics.

* In the first population, there is a small set of rules with extremely harsh punishments for those who violate them.

* In the second population, there is a massive set of rules with moderate punishments for those who violate them.

You have to take the entire passage into context. In Paul's letter to the Ephesians, he clearly creates a contract. Children should honor and love their powers, **however** he goes on to say that parents should also love and treat their children well. This covenant between child and parent is obviously broken when the parents are abusive. This is constantly taken out of context by awful parents who simply abuse their children. However this abuse can be a stranglehold over your life and haunt you, so you must also forgive the parents who have treated you so horribly. Even secular counselors will say this. It sets you free from them.

&gt; Who decides which passages in the book are ignored and which are followed; man, no?

Pretty much. This is the touchiest of touchy subjects. There is a ton of archeological evidence that shows that most of the canonical Bible we have today are made up of a core group of documents that were shared and faithfully recopied by all churches throughout southern Europe and the Middle East, but there were a few that the early church fathers really struggled with making it in there. If you don't believe that at least most of what we have in our current Bible was God's Word, then you don't have much absolute basis in debating if anything is valid in Christianity or not.

&gt; Why is it that a book written hundreds of years ago holds more sway over your decisions than basing it on the science and knowledge gleaned by humanity in the centuries since?

Only the most hostile, secular professor would completely shoot down the Bible on all counts. That book you're referring to has become the cornerstone of Western civilization for 1,500 years. It literally permeates everything. Every single major political system you can conceive of draws at least some inspiration from the Bible. The idea that you have natural, inalienable rights that no one can take away, which is completely unjustified in nature and therefore science, is something that has been passed down to you by Christianity. Plato, Socrates, Aristotle, Caesar Augustus, Marcus Aurelius... Every single brilliant, highly moral classical philosopher you can think of completely disagreed with this proposition. You show compassion to your family and friends, because that is what you find in nature, but there is absolutely no reason you shouldn't invade another country, kill everyone, rape its women and enslave the entire population. Wolves don't help wolves from other packs. The notion that all human beings have worth and should be treated with dignity is derived from Christianity. It is the belief that Jesus died for the sins of all, that everyone is called to have a personal relationship with God and that God loves everyone, and so should you. This concept simply did not exist, and as hard as Chris Hitchens tries to prove it did, it is just utterly false.

Have you ever visited the Colosseum in Rome? It's still huge now, but for its time it was **enormous**. It lays in ruins now, but did you know that originally it was gilded in gold? Gold taken from the Temple of Jerusalem when the Romans razed and sacked it? The Colosseum was where the public went to watch human beings fight to the death or be consumed by lions for public entertainment. **Public entertainment**. And this wasn't just some deviant sideshow, it was the centerpiece of leisure in the Roman Empire, and the fact that they gilded the entire structure in gold tells you something about how the people regarded this past time.

Even with the most abominable examples we can find in the modern world, like the Holocaust for example, the Nazis never degenerated to the point where the gassing of Jews became a public spectacle. It wasn't televised or celebrated. It was clear that this systematic genocide of an entire people was still regarded with a sense of shame, however small, because it was done with some measure of discretion. As openly racist and heinous as they were, they never made entertainment out of it. Now I'm not saying that religion or the Bible solved all the worlds problems. Obviously it created problems as well, but you have to understand the massive humanizing effect it had.

**That** is why the Bible is significant.

&gt; I really do not understand why such a vast number of people continue base their life upon these words; yes, a small group of people do use the faith of others to climb up the religious ladder so they can achieve the power of infallibility and be allowed to practice their perverted fantasies upon the followers, but most just follow blindly accepting anything they are told by their religious authority.

People imprint too much of their culture on Christianity. They think Jesus was a Republican or that Paul was a socialist, etc, etc. What they don't understand is that Christianity transcends all those things and to use it as a tool for control or politicizing is wrong. Jesus made that quite clear when the Pharisees confronted him about paying taxes. This was seen as a Catch-22 question: They asked Jesus if the Jews should pay their taxes or tithe to the temple. To say you shouldn't pay taxes and instead pay tithes was treason in the Roman Empire, and you would be arrested. To say that you should pay taxes and not tithe was to recognize the Roman emperor as a god, and therefore you would be a heretic. So Jesus asked who's face is on the denarius, to which the Pharisees reply, ""The caesar, of course,"" and Jesus says, ""Render unto caesar what is caesar's, and render unto God what is God's"". Which means politics and religion are not meant to intercede.

Paul also shatters the mindset of being overly mystical and relying on cult-like emotions in the Eastern mindset such as the Levant, but he also criticized the overly analytical, legalist and judgmental tradition of the Western mindset found in the Romans. People blindly follow because they do not think, and people take advantage of those followers because they do not feel.

If that were true HIV would have vanished 2 weeks after it started back in the 1980s. Its all about genetics my friend. Research now is attempting to use the fact that certain people from old europeon stock are virtually immune to HIV. To cause a modification to the immune system over time that makes HIV infection as harmless as a simple cold. At that point, the meds can be stopped. NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO BELIEVE IN WITCH DOCTORS.

I think it is a considerable hindrance to our historical perspective as Westerners that we basically start out with the simplistic equation of Hitler = 'pure, Platonic incarnation of evil' before we even begin our studies of that part of history or of the man. Which is what he was. He was a man. I actually don't think he was a) evil, or b) a genius. 

So far as being evil goes, I think the collective psychology of his society at that point in history was pretty fucking evil. He grew up in the peak of European Imperialism. The whole mindset of that period of history was infused with ideas of white supremacy and very brutal terms of discussion. 

I think our over-demonization of Hitler is our way of either apologizing for or even distracting from the plethora of evil shit going in our ""superior"" white society at that time. And European Antisemitism goes back two thousand years. 

The fact is Hitler, we can't divorce Hitler from **us** (white Europeans). He was a man of the times (die Zeitgeist). He *was* a man of the people, of the thinking and psychology of that era. Just as Mussolini, Franco and Stalin were men of their times as well.

Secondly, he wasn't a genius. He was a genius at motivating people, and at utilising other people's good ideas, that is all. One of the biggest reasons behind Nazi Germany's multiple military failures was Hitlers interference in his generals' strategies. He also refused to invade England on racial grounds, and failed to befriend disenchanted Eastern European/West Asian populations (angry at Stalin) also for racial reasons which cost him those conquered territories. In fact, most of what made him so successful was the product of racist nationalism born of European expansion at that point in history. I doubt if anything similar could be replicated today (and especially not in India), and personally, I'd have to argue that Hitlers management style is more of a historical curiosity, not a practical one.",1278245713,c0thpt6,,[deleted],False

It is a colonial state that has no more justification than the French in Algeria/Vietnam, England in Kenya/India, or the Dutch in South Africa. 

Zionism is an insult to Judaism, that has enforced itself based on justifications from a European narrative unto the Jews internationally (because, Indian, Arab, Ethiopian, and other non-European Jews did not face the same experience as their European peers). 

Israel is also a racist state that denys the original indeginious inhabitants their right to live in a free and just matter. 

So I do think Thoma's words were brave, especially in the America, where it is a climate that is majorily supportive towards Israel (whilst the rest of the international community is not a fan).

The drunk walked away as soon as a friend came to arrest the girl. From what I can tell, they said the sober guy did the ""arrest and takedown"". 

Here is the difference. Europeans don't really see how it's possible someone was beaten to a pulp and had teeth knocked out by 200+ pound men for blowing a whistle.

Is that the European narrative? Because if you actually read up on Middle Eastern history and spoke with Arab Jews (and read their accounts, diaries, and history), they worked within the state, were highly important in the academic circles, and culturally and economically flourished. This was whilst Europeans where doing the Spanish Inquisition thing (no one expects the Spanish Inquisition) and were committing pogroms after terrible pogroms. 

So please, spare me the Zionist historical myths and try reading these accounts, you can find them translated in English. Mark you, it was until after 1948 that things went bad for the Arab Jews (however, lets not forget the Mossad's role in bombing synagogues in Iraq - very well reported on and you can find this in the public domain- in order to create fright and flight.) If you actually look at where they immigrated to, many choice the States because they did not buy the Zionist lie. 
Syrian Jews left because of the economic and political hardships in Syria that everyone faced, they mostly went to New York and New Jersey, where this is a large community. 

I do care about racism in general, and i abhore every racist state, mine included. So no, your logic of ""oh theres racism over there, so its ok to be racist"" is silly in my mind. I abhore pan-Arabism for its exclusivity, and I abohore all religious states because they fail in adequently representing minorities. 

This ""magic"" is practical, your attitude was the same that Afrikkaners had in the 1980s...they were quite wrong. It is also racist because it assumes the inability for the population to live together. 

We have been living quite well for thousands of years, until the Europeans came along with their Zionism - hence your riots of the 20s,30s, and 40s directed towards European Jews, not Jews. Not to mention the role England played in adding to the tensions, and not to mention the use of car bombs (first of its kind in the region, i cite Buda's Wagon - A History of the Car Bomb) and other forms of terrorism by the Haganah, the Irgun, and the Stern Gang (who transformed to the, ironically called, Israel Defense Force) that probably added to the tensions. 

So let me know when you take into account history, rather than the parroting of a pamphlet you read in a pro-Israel lecture or meeting. 

Again, I highly suggest reading the accounts of Arab Jews (one of the first fighters against Zionism actually), and the accounts of other Jews who do not by the Zionist myth.

In 1964 the first PLO Council, consisting of 422 Palestinian representatives handpicked by the KGB, approved the Palestinian National Charter—a document that had been drafted in Moscow. The Palestinian National Covenant and the Palestinian Constitution were also born in Moscow, with the help of Ahmed Shuqairy, a KGB influence agent who became the first PLO chairman.  This new PLO was headed by a Soviet-style Executive Committee made up of 15 members who, like their comrades in Moscow, also headed departments. As in Moscow—and Bucharest—the chairman of the Executive Committee became the general commander of the armed forces as well. The new PLO also had a General Assembly, which was the Soviet-inspired name given to all East European parliaments after World War II.

 

Based on another “socialist division of labor,” the Romanian espionage service (DIE) was responsible for providing the PLO with logistical support. Except for the arms, which were supplied by the KGB and the East German Stasi, everything else came from Bucharest. Even the PLO uniforms and the PLO stationery were manufactured in Romania free of charge, as a “comradely help.” During those years, two Romanian cargo planes filled with goodies for the PLO landed in Beirut every week, and were unloaded by Arafat’s men.

I live in Denver Colorado. Two summers ago we hosted the Democratic National Convention when Obama where Obama was officially nominated by the party for president of the united states. In the months leading up to the convention we had all of the crazies coming out of the woodwork to threaten Denver. 

The ""recreate 68"" folks promised to burn down the city. The far lunatic fringe on the right wanted to literally kill Obama. Veterans groups planned war protest marches... in short, there was a better than not chance of complete chaos (see Toronto right now).

The point being: This was a high pressure situation. Living Downtown, I saw the whole thing unfold everyday. I saw police officers, dressed in literal riot gear, helping folks find things in the city. I saw them posing for photographs. I saw them laughing and socializing the thousands of folks attending the convention. They could not have been better.

I saw them utilize reasonable force when the hooligans decided to try to shut down two of our busiest streets. They didn't kill anyone.. they simply herded them onto another street and made some arrests when the crowd wouldn't disperse. I was honestly impressed by how well the whole thing was handled (of course, there was plenty of lunacy all over the Internet decrying the 'police brutality'... which of course was as far from the truth as you could get).

The point being: Our police are a lot like yours... which you'll find is generally true about most things. It's considered 'cool' among young folks to be anti-establishment right now and that's why you see basically non-stop hating on the United States these days. Things aren't even in the vicinity of what you probably think is going on over here (and vice-versa, after all we're all pretty sure that all of Europe has given way to anti-immigrant violence).

Come on over, I think you'll be surprised about how polite and sensible 99% of our cops are. That doesn't excuse the ones who do horrible things and hide behind their badges.

First, this is a conflict not so much between liberals and conservatives, but between urban and rural voters.

Urbanies only think about guns when someone gets killed, so they are naturally apprehensive about them, and tend to back - or at least not object to - more regulations. Rural voters use guns as tools in their daily lives. Of course, sometimes people get killed, but sometimes they get killed by knives, too. We don't ban tools because people misuse them, right?

Now, urban voters are typically liberal, and rural voters are usually conservative. So, ""cum hoc ergo propter hoc"".

Most European countries - and vast majority of European countries are much much much more liberal than US - allow for gun ownership. For example, in Switzerland males keep their army-issued - automatic weapons - at home. A lot of highly revered weapons and component manufacturers - Lapua, Tikka, Anzhutz are European, and target European customers. In Canada the guns are registered, and handguns are severely restricted, but higher percentage of population owns guns, and guns are generally cheaper, especially military imports (e.g. you can buy an SVT there for ~$400, whereas the price in the US is around $800, SKS can be had for $200 in CA, &gt; $300 in the US). Yes, there is more gun regulations, but should people who do not know how to handle a gun really own one?

Second, SA itself. It reads as follows:

""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.""

When it was written, it had 2 meanings. First, the Militia was required for protecting the US against the foreign invasion. Early Americans treated Army with a very healthy dose of contempt, because they were afraid that a popular military leader might stage a coup. Many founders were against creating a Navy. Second, the Militia was needed to guard against a tyrannical government, should a coup be staged.

In either case, the intent of SA was to ensure that a fighting force capable of protecting the people of the US against a government, foreign or domestic.

Back in late 18th century, small arms were enough for this purpose, but these days no one could legitimately claim that a bunch of AR-15s would match weapons available to a typical military - fighter planes, bombers, tanks, armoured personnel carriers, ships, submarines, and nuclear weapons.

So if we are arguing that the laws that regulate the gun ownership are drawn from SA, then following the intent of the law we should allow for private ownership of serious military hardware, including the nukes. I don't think that anyone would seriously entertain this idea, but this is what Second Amendment is all about :-).",1278305750,c0tj7gv,,solyanik,False

This means MOS and life after the military.  Think about what you like to do.  Like computers?  Signal.  Like building stuff or blowing it up?  Engineers.  Fixing stuff?  Depends on what you like fix, there are vehicle mechanics, jet mechanics, helicopter mechanics, electronic repairmen, radar repairmen.  There are cooks, reporters, clerks, language specialists, chaplain assistants, x-ray techs, cops, cartoonists, writers, etc.  There are TONS of different jobs.  Pick the one you think you would enjoy the most.  If you don't mind not showering for days or weeks, like the rush of getting shot at and in fist fights to the death...then its combat arms for you baby!

If you aren't planning on it being a career, go for a technical job where you can get some experience that you can translate to a job on the outside.  Not a lot of job demand for artillery specialists in the civilian world.

2.)  How much macho bullshit can you stand?

Lots of guys eventually get sick of locker room bullshit.  Eventually cursing, spitting, fighting, and drinking get old.  Combat arms like infantry, armor, artillery are famous for their meat-heads.  Every day will be like being on a football team with ""prove how hooah you are.""  If that's not you, then go with a non-combat arm.  Though in the Army and Marines you will still get it to some degree no matter where you go.  Navy isn't as big on macho bullshit, but you do need to be tough.  Think of it like being a steel mill worker, or auto plant employee; blue collar, cold beer, and the Pittsburgh Steelers.  Air Force does have its military side, but its more like Starfleet than Klingon if you catch my drift.  Air Force is sort of like a James Bond villain.  They would rather fuck you up with their smarts than their fists, but will if they have to.

3)  Oh the places you will go.

Have a wife and kids?  Well with the current deployment rates, in the Army and Marines you will maybe see them 2 years out of a 4 year enlistment.  Navy you are gone about 6 months to a year at a time if you are with the fleet.  Air force rotations are usually shorter depending on the MOS.  This WILL NOT CHANGE for the foreseeable future.

Stateside bases....
A large number of military bases are on land even the Native Americans said, ""Fuck you, no."" to.  Air Forces bases can be literally in the middle of a wheat field in Nebraska with nothing for 80 miles in any direction.
Army and Marine bases don't come with places nicknamed ""Camp Swampy"" ""The Hood."" ""Lost in the Woods"" for nothing.  Hope you don't want to go New York or L.A. style clubbing because it really won't happen unless you don't mind driving about 2 hours or so.  Navy Bases, when you aren't living on the boat itself, are hit or miss.  Its where you get shore leave that counts.
If you get stationed in Europe you lucked out.  Many an American living in Germany is an ex-soldier that never wanted to leave.  The Pacific outside of Hawaii can be cool, just wear a raincoat and watch your wallet.  Korea?  Yeah it can be awesome, but at any point that midget could decide to go Napoleon on you.

4.)  Why are you joining?
No jobs back home?  Any branch will do.
Discipline?  Marines baby.
Hi-tech training?  Navy or Air Force...you can walk in off the street and if you are smart enough within two years you are running a nuclear reactor.
See the world?  Navy...though they don't tell you most of the world is ocean.
Kill something?  Army or Marines.

5.) Who are you?
This is the great abstract.  Sure you will learn a lot about yourself joining the service so the ads don't lie there, but you have to have an idea before you get there.  Do you know when to keep your mouth shut?  Thats rule #1 of any branch of service; swallowing your pride and your ego.  How tolerant are you?  You will meet people that you would never normally meet.  In the same rank in formation you will stand next to a Muslim, a New Yorker (you'll learn they are a special breed), a former street thug, a bible thumper, a closeted homosexual, a sexist Guido type, a homophobe, a militant atheist, a drunk, someone who reads Russian literature and listens to Mozart, a rich kid with something to prove to dad, and someone who lives in their barracks room and plays WoW all night...  Can you get along with all of them when the time comes?  How much stress can you handle?  What are you afraid of...not like spiders or heights...but like failure, death, disappointing someone?  What happens when you can't handle stress?  Can you keep yourself out of trouble?  There is a lot of temptation out there for a soldier with a full wallet, a sex drive, and a bottle of booze.

First, I should clarify that the debate ""Was America founded as a Christian nation,"" is actually comprised of 2 separate points. The first ""Was America founded with the expectation of it being a nation devoted to Christian values and championing Christian causes"" is the oft-discussed topic. But there is a second, more important, question that is imbedded in the debate by the Christian right, and it often escapes our notice: ""*Should we consider America a strictly Christian nation, even if that was the framers' intent?*"" To the first question I say no. To the second I say definitively NO. Christian legal codification had its time, and that time was called the Dark and Middle ages. It ended with the 30-Years War and I feel that is all that needs to be said on that matter. I will leave the second question in this debate for you to argue at your own discretion and I will focus on the first point: **""Was America founded with the expectation of it being a nation devoted to Christian values and championing Christian causes""?**

First, don't over-extend yourself in your claims. 

&gt;Exact interpretations of deism vary, but are definitely arguable for... George Washington...

Washington seemed either A) a religious man of some degree who kept his religion respectfully in the private sphere, or B) a man for whom we know little of his faith. Ultimately, I think he left little evidence to support the claim that he was a deist in the Jeffersonian sense, aside that he was receptive to Jefferson's and Madison's advice about the necessity to separate church and state for the sake of both institutions. This point, I think, has more to do with Washington's personal knowledge of the history of political philosophy than an ambivalence about his own Christianity. (The two books he kept on his nightstand were the Bible and Addison's *Cato*.) So tread lightly on the Washington issue.

Next, try to attack the biggest claim he makes, which is actually two claims:

&gt;A) Yes, the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence are documents based on the tenets of the Bible by individuals who practiced Christianity. B) It was clearly a part of their life experience.

Claim A is demonstrably false. The Constitution codifies almost no specific aspects of biblical law, and none beyond those codes that are uniform among almost all modern religions and states. The sources you need for this are 1) a copy of the Constitution and 2) a copy of the bible. Conceptually, the declaration is based largely on the works of Locke and his secular philosophical predecessors. Aquinas and Augustine had little to do with it.

Now lets take a step back. What *is* true is that many founders believed that morality was not possible *without* a specific belief in a deity who imposed moral law upon humanity. Locke himself shared this view. (This is understandable, as they lacked today's knowledge of evolved morality and neuro-biology.) However, all that seemed to be required of the citizenry to fulfill this need was a mere belief in the objective moral codes set in place by a God at the beginning. This is, at its core, a deist proposition (and obviously NOT the same as atheism! Try to clear that one up). Cite Washington's letter to the Newport Jews, specifically the 

&gt;the Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, *requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens in giving it on all occasions their effectual support.*

Which he later expands to include all Abraham religions. Specific Christian beliefs systems were obviously NOT the critical point. What's more, Jefferson displayed his beliefs along similar lines, particularly with regards to the Jefferson bible. 

Claim B, his second claim:

&gt;[Christianity] was clearly a part of their life experience.

Is both true and irrelevant. Christianity was ubiquitous in the lives of Western Europeans and Americans, especially among political leaders who needed to consider popular reception to their political propositions. Slavery and subjugation of women were *also* both also parts of their life experience. The question is: to what degree did their private beliefs influence the founding documents. I think, upon a simple evaluation of the primary source material, you see naught but the most tangential connections between Christian theology and the Constitution. **Try and bring the argument back to this point. Ask, and be persistent, that he provide evidence beyond the fact that religion was present in the lives of the founders. Ask for the proof where the founders state that specific structural components of the Constitution and Declaration (and not just superficial language) was directly influenced by the Christian bible.** Christian founders seem to tiptoe around this point or provide shoddy evidence that has been shot down in the past.

Now if you like, I can bring up some specifically false claims that he made in his final response to you, but I think this is a bad idea on two counts. 1) if you engage him in the messy details, you will have to devote far too much of your valuable time in researching and debunking baseless claim after baseless claim that religious-founder proponents have had decades to accrue. It's tiring. 2) This whole thing ultimately comes back to the imperative claim made above: the concrete evidence that specific structural components of the Constitution and Declaration (and not just superficial language) was directly influenced by the Christian bible. THIS is where the debate resides and where you cannot waiver from. If you are to refute claims, only do so for those claims that directly address *this* point!

That being said, there is literally NOTHING said in the last paragraph that supports the above claim. The final third appears to be an attempt to convert you or something, so be wary. This seems to be someone with a wholly alternate agenda here.",1278337081,c0tjrwx,,AngryRepublican,False

Some complain about a repetitive gameplay but imho APB has more mission types and battle locations than any other shooter out there (Counter-Strike Dust2 anyone?). 

Some compain about the matchmaking but imho the matchmaking is great and keeps you permanent in action with good matching opponents most of the time. It's not perfect and sometimes you get assigned against much better opponents but if that happens you can use the ""call for backup"" function.

Some complain that its enervating to play the missions alone but there is a build in and automatic LFF system.

Some complain about lag but i never experienced lag (on the EU servers). Some complain about the graphics... well thats a matter of taste anyways.

He does make a good point. I still hold that the final ratio is pretty much equal to the initial ratio but maybe that doesn't matter either.

Sadly I didn't watch the game so I don't know if I should believe the Mexican and Paraguayan (Chilavert) commentators in Univision who complained that the ref let Holland beat on the Brazilian players the whole first half, or if I should just go with what my wife (Brazilian) said, that Brazil just played a bad second half and didn't deserve it. Not that any of it matters anyway. Just like Germany beat England after cheating on Englands second goal, which say what you want about it, would have made for a completely different second half.
But in the end the reality is once you go past the first round, a little bit of luck can get you far, look at Uruguay for example, they qualified last in South America, but they got to play easier teams until now. The Europeans on the other hand, they have so many teams in that everyone they had to play until quarter-finals was themselves.

I studied Political Science, but be aware that this is certainly not a must. You can come from really anywhere, and still have a shot working for the UN. However, PoliSci, or anything related, certainly gives you a very good preparation for what to expect out here.

The UN lifestyle is of course a little wild, and you definitely have to be able and be open-minded of traveling (often), learning new languages, and being exposed to other cultures. Personally, I do not have my own family yet (no GF either), so I am free to move around as I desire. 

I plan on doing so until my early - mid thirties, when I eventually will try to settle down. Do not worry too much: Some limit their travels, e.g. moving around only every few years, and others are able to settle in one of the UNs main headquarters, e.g. in NYC or Geneva. I like that idea, having traveled and witnessed the world, thus gained plenty of work field experience, and subsequently being able to use this acquired knowledge for the purpose of a more theoretical management position somewhere in West Europe / USA.

This 'detachment' has good and bad sides; again, obviously, I get to see a lot of this world, though on the bad side, I have certainly made more acquaintances than *friends*. That is something to consider and one has to live with - In order to stay happy, it took me a while to be aware of this 'problem', and rather turn it into something positive.

His primary focus was on organized crime and weapons trafficking.  He is fairly neutral on the issue of handgun restrictions, tending towards favoring tougher gun ownership curbs, but has frequently mentioned the futility of a lot of restrictions in the face of an absolute flood of weapons entering European cities via ports.  

According to him, it simply is not possible to control the movement of illegal weapons when faced with large numbers of seaports (or airports for that matter) and comparatively open international borders; we've had several conversations on our way to and from work where he described things like his organization moving their focus away from narcotics and small-caliber weapons due to the fact that they were dealing with large Eastern European gangs moving even rocket launchers (!) through Northern Europe in considerable numbers with near impunity.

It seems what you describe is a fundamentally hypocritical position: talking about divinely bestowed status and at the same time using the language of religion ""metaphorically""(ie, not literally; there isn't really a creator). Hedging their bets?
But how do religions begin? What we see here is how they can be phased out; ""bare bones belief in a creator"" is surely not a starting position but a transition from a more institutional sort of religion to something new.

Buddhism is interesting because it appears to be such a transitional state, in which some older religious belief (Hinduism?) has had its deities replaced by a human who nevertheless achieves a god-like status through reincarnation (the Dali Llama, for example). To say these are not Gods is a fine point lost on the Taliban, when they blasted the Buddhist statues at Bamiyan because they were idols.

To define religion largely on the basis of the tyrannical mind-control systems of state religion which dominated Europe at least since the days of Constantine is to miss the essential point: it is a personal conviction about how things are, shared by a group of people. Institutions and rituals, etc. follow from that, a process strikingly described in the novel 'Lord of the Flies'.

But one can argue endlessly and to no avail about religion.

Gun control is a question of measure.  The U.S. has ""gun control"" -- you are required to submit to a background check, most states have some sort of limits on who can own weapons (felons, e.g.), certain kinds of weapons and accessories are outlawed, etc.  American gun control is simply far less strict than, say, German or Austrian gun control.

In Switzerland, I had to go visit the police in Zurich for a license to obtain a weapon.  The weapon must now be registered (I have some old ones that aren't, but they're antiques and, frankly, nobody's business), I must show ID to buy ammunition, I may not carry it on me unless it's unloaded and I'm on my way to/from the range, etc.  

I am familiar with most European gun laws; I am a member of the Royal Dutch shooting club, and own several firearms in Switzerland.  I argue for less restrictive gun laws in European countries as a European, not as an American.  I attempt to engage in an informed debate on the topic, which often comes in the face of ""oh, gun owners are all crazy egotistical Rambo types"" (I actually get this a lot), or ""it's just Americans trying to force their system on us"", or some variation on these.

This is the statement I take issue with.  This is simply not true.  It is true the moment you expect criminals to want to obtain firearms through legal means -- but that is about akin to saying that airplane hijackers try to get machine guns through security checks.  They don't. 

Yes, the restrictions keep criminals from buying guns through legal channels, but I'll use the example of the Netherlands, a country of 16.5 million people.   A very quick search results in [an estimate of 85,000 - 120,000](http://qsi.cc/blog/archives/000144.html) illegal firearms in the country -- that is a very large number, considering that it will be primarily limited to certain areas in large urban concentrations like Rotterdam, Den Haag, and Amsterdam.

But, before I continue, let me stress that I do still have misgivings about this war, and that for the longest time I strongly debated with friends the case that you can't win in Afghanistan so its a waste of time to take that strategy.

Let's look at what Obama was facing when he came to power:

* Afghanistan was deteriorating. Privately, I suspect, the Pakistani were balking at American demands to do something about the militants in their territory. There was, at the time, a agreement of sorts between the Pakistani government and the tribal areas that was keeping the peace. Sidenote: I often muse at how different things might have been had Bush focused on Afghanistan instead of starting a war on a second front.

* The Mumbai attacks happened on 26 [November 2008](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Mumbai_attacks). Just after Obama was elected, before he took office. India was furious, and the attacks were suspected to have come from Pakistan.

* Obama came to office with a big promise to end the wars. Thinking about it, I can't imagine he would consider it a good idea to just break that promise casually. All apparent evidence is that the administration wrangled for a long time to decide what the appropriate course in Afghanistan was. I really believe now they really didn't want to escalate, but felt forced to.

* So, what would placate India from reprisals against Pakistan? Why should America care? I think the Administration strategists basically said, if India attacks Pakistan while we're still trying to clean things up in Afghanistan, this is going to be a bigger mess than anything else and we'll be stuck in the middle of it.

* When Obama announced the military deployment in Afghanistan, I noted the strong criticism from Pakistan against the deadline imposed by the American administration.  Eventually I came to the conclusion that there was a connection between the American deployment and the Pakistani military initiative in their tribal areas bordering Afghanistan.

* Finally, we've seen all manner of bombings in Pakistan. It's been brutal there. The Pakistani military initiative is very unpopular in Pakistan and American drone attacks have gotten a lot of headlines.  What could possibly impel a Pakistani government to endure all this stress? It has to be what I suspect is Indian pressure for something to happen.

* America had demanded under Bush of many of its allies to help. ""If you aren't with us, you are against us"" is the famously retarded thing he said back then. And so many allies did rise up to help. Canada, European countries etc... This too added pressure because their military initiatives are also unpopular. For Obama to come in and just cancel everything would smack of dumping the political cost of the war on them. Not a way to keep friends.


** And: **

So, when I said that I understand why Obama did what he felt he had to do, I meant that I see now that there was no good way to end this.  The option to just leave and let things settle would cause a lot more problems as described above.

I hate war. And I have nothing but scorn for the arrogant way the previous administration started a two wars. But starting the wars wasn't Obama's responsibility. I believe he's trying to take the practical approach based on what his advisers told him.

In conclusion, I really think the administration strongly considered your position of just leaving. Doing that would solve a lot of problems internally for the nation.  I just think that upon consideration, Obama's administration decided just leaving would be a disaster.

And that's why I said I understand what he did. That doesn't mean I'm happy with it. This war and the Iraq one have both saddened me a lot.  I just think I realize now that when the President says this is complicated, he is really speaking from his heart, but unable to give the full analysis because of all the implications that would arise out of doing so.

You are right that you can't just go around obliterating governments, but that wasn't Obama's choice. He just has to clean up.

Luckily, the downtowns of most American cities are full of parking lots to accompany our car culture, so this means plenty of space for re-development.

First, it is completely inaccurate to call the Turkish perspective ""previous interest"" as the Turkish are both still on the island and are presently engaged in deliberate immigration to the island of Cyprus.

In fact, I just happened to have listened to a Cypriot ambassador on the issue just last year.

See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Cyprus

See: 

&gt; Northern Cyprus has **received diplomatic recognition only from Turkey**, upon which it is dependent for economic, political and military support. The rest of the international community, including the United Nations and the European Union, recognises the de jure sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus over the entire island.

This is a current problem.  An ongoing one.  Essentially, Northern Cyprus is a colonial territory or occupied area of Cyprus.  It is currently dependent on Turkey for basically everything.  Thus, it is not ""previous interest.""


----


Second, I never said disregard the Turkish anger, but to understand its context and lack of substantial value.  Anyone who reads this article or sees this post and thinks it is a Major local power of influence should instead view it for what it is - hypocrisy.  Hypocrites aren't de facto wrong, however, their bombastic attitude reeks of do as I say not as I do and it makes the comments cut hollow.  

No other country in the world beside Turkey recognizes Turkish ""Northern Cyprus"" as a state.  Similarly, the control they exercise over the area is akin to the control in Israel over Gaza.  The way Northern Cyprus stays independent is by getting money and troops and people from Turkey and is otherwise an invention of the Turkish government.  A minority political party does not a separate state make.

Your comment simply misses the point that Turkey's threat is really a hollow, bullshit comment of a state that has done as it pleased with half an island and the world has barely said a thing.  


-----

Look what happened to the Hutus and Tootsies and Tamil Tigers and Cashmere between India and Pakistan.  What still goes on with the Kurds in Northern Iraq, but are also in Iran and I believe Syria, among others.  Kurds are basically without a country, though they do have some autonomous powers in Iraq.

If you really want to go for a global lesson on geopolitics and talk about how the Israelis are all of a sudden standing alone - just look to their neighbors.  Their calls of disgust ring so hollow when just a few months ago a prince from another arabian country was able to beat and run a prisoner over with a car and had the government call everything proper.

China is showing signs of economic weakness and slowed demand. Europe is going through a regional economic crisis that may end up blowing up on a global scale. The U.K has record budget deficits and high unemployment similar to the U.S..

The USA is printing money to counteract deflationary forces and running record budget deficits in the process. Many U.S. states are on the verge of bankruptcy (in order of likelyhood: Illinois, California and New York). Inflation worries are a red herring. The real problem with the economy is that it was propped up by over inflated asset prices. Now that the assets aren't worth anything or worth less than 50% of their original value (home loans for example), a lot of money, to the tune of 10's of trillions of dollars was destroyed. Banks are holding onto properties to manipulate the price of housing and in some cases allowing foreclosed individuals to stay in the property.

The actual unemployment rate in the U.S. is close to the Great Depression all time high of 25% at roughly 22% of people who are seeking full-time work but can't obtain it. The current ""official"" statistics of 9.5% cherry-pick individuals and leaves out large groups such as young people entering the workforce after high school/ college, people who work only part-time because that's all they can find, self-employed people who lost their business in the economic collapse, people who ran out of unemployment benefits but still haven't found a job, etc. The move from 9.7% unemployment to 9.5% last month was due to unemployed people losing their benefits, not because the economy grew more jobs.

The U.S. spends 10's of billions of dollars a month that it doesn't have on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In many cases, the money is going straight to the ""terrorists"" we're trying to flush out via pay-offs to regional warlords in Afghanistan. There is no long-term benefit from spending this money to train drug addict, illiterate Afghanistani men to become soldiers when they are defecting to the enemy after training. 

The huge fiscal drag of the military on the U.S. government is hurting the economy through expectations of higher taxes in the future. Austerity measures are being put into place to pay off government debts globally which hurt business (lowers demand) and working people (reduced savings and consumption).

&gt;  A brief History: Les Kiriki - Acrobates japonais

&gt;  (Ki Ri Ki - Japanese Acrobats)
&gt;  Production date: 1907

&gt;  Irresistible film that inspired many artists (including choreographer Philippe Decouflé), this three-minute gem was shot by Segundo de Chomón (1871-1929), special effect specialist hired by Pathé to direct a series of films based on special effects and meant to compete with those of Georges Méliès.

&gt;  Chomón witnesses the birth of the cinematograph in 1896 during a stay in Paris. This Spanish man originating from Teruel quits his office job and starts working for Georges Méliès as a colorist. He moves on to Pathé Frères where he contributes to set up a system of industrial coloring: the Pathécolor.

&gt;  In 1901, Chomón settles in Barcelona. He directs numerous documentaries, has a go at animation and effects. Called back by Pathé to Paris, Chomón works as a camera operator on Le Roi des Aulnes (The Erl-King) in particular. He directs all in all about forty films and makes an attempt at every genre.


&gt;  This film only existed in its black and white version. Thank to the collaboration of the Cinémathèque Française, depositary of the black and white original single-perf negative, we have been able to make three positive prints.

I took some time to look through your post history before I replied and came across this gem:

&gt; one in the arctic and one in the tropics. In the arctic you need the cooperation of the group to survive the winter, in the tropics you could pretty well go lone wolf year round. Anyone with anti-social personality disorder would be at risk of alienating the group and dying in the arctic once winter comes, vs. the tropical one who can survive without.

I mean, you could at least read up on the societies you're trying to talk about. 

I could go on, but there are numerous examples in your post history that lead me to the conclusion that A) you don't really understand the term ""race"" ( ""One example: the femur (leg) of Africans is straighter, whereas in Europeans it tends to be curved."" it seems you don't understand that in Africa there are many distinct groups whose physical traits differ greatly) B) you *want* to believe that your group is ""better"" than others and you use the tried-and-true ""Well, I'm not a racist, but it would be unfortunate if science was made to bow to political correctness yadda yadda yadda"" and rather predictably you have libertarian leanings. Very common with people who really want to *believe* that racial differences are major and real and matter. I don't know why - but I suppose it probably has to do with the large amount of white upper middle class males who make up the libertarian base. I could be wrong, however.

----

I worked in energy for years. The one quote that sums up the real reasons utilities don't like wind is this:

&gt;    The key thing here is that we are beginning to unveil what I've labelled the dirty secret of wind: utilities don't like wind not because it's not competitive, but because it brings prices down for their existing assets, thus lowering their revenues and their profits.

But there is one complication to this that environmentalists need to recognize.

With the liberty of some simplification, electricity in the US and Europe is priced hourly in auctions. Each generator is asked for a price at which they are willing to generate electricity and for the amount of electricity they can generate. The auction clears at the price where supply meets demand, that is, every generator gets paid the same price no matter what it costs them to produce the electricity.

In a very simplified example, a small town requires 1000MW for the next hour. There are no wind generators that supply this town, only a coal plant and a natural gas plant. The coal operator can supply 700MW at a price of $20/MW, the gas operator can supply 500MW at $27/MW. The market will clear at $27/MW, taking 700MW from the coal plant and 300MW from the gas plant. The coal operator will get paid ($27/MW)x(700MW) = $18,900 for that hour and the gas operator will get paid ($27/MW)x(300MW) = $8,100. If we assume that both operators are pricing in $2/MW of margin (profit) into their prices, that means the coal plant profits ($27/MW - $18/MW)x(700MW) = $6,300 and the gas plant profits ($27/MW - $25/MW)x(300MW) = $600.

Now say the town installs 500MW capacity of windmills. Let's rerun the scenario. The town needs 1000MW for one hour again. The wind operator says the wind is blowing moderately and it can supply 300MW for $2/MW (essentially his costs are $0/MW - he doesn't need to pay to use the wind and there are no workers and wages to pay). The operators put the same bids as before. Now the market clears at $20/MW because you only need the supply from the wind and coal operators to meet demand. Wind profits ($20/MW - $0/MW)x(300MW) = $6,000; coal profits ($20/MW - $18/MW)x(700MW) = $1,400; and gas profits $0.

As you can see, the coal and gas plants become less profitable. So tough shit to them, right? Well okay fuck coal, but now you have replaced a relatively clean and reliable source (natural gas) with a clean but unreliable source (wind). So the point is that wind (and solar) have a tendency to cut the profits of coal, but not necessarily eliminate their emissions (in the example, coal was running at 700MW in both scenarios). Furthermore, wind and solar have the tendency to price relatively clean and reliable sources out of the market.

I am not trying to bash wind (or solar), but I just want people to realize they are not reliable sources of energy and they do not have the muscle to get rid of the cheapest and dirtiest emitters (coal).

It seems obvious from the fascinating quotes from Jefferson you supply that his convictions belong to the Protestant tradition, which tends towards schismatic sects and, ultimately, individualism. His point of view is not likely to have arisen within a Roman Catholic context. His very protestations against conformity support his Protestant background. This is not to say he is a Lutheran or a Calvinist or whatever, but you can see how this tradition leads to the view he espouses.

Tolerance of others, his ideal, is not of course shared by sects which focus on a group identity. But a group identity, based on separate individuals, is what he is advocating here, and name-calling (ridicule) is a tool he recommends - does this not seem contradictory in itself? Is it tolerant to call someone who does not follow one's argument a mountebank who uses abracadabra? And what if other individuals find conformity to a group identity more comforting, and reject his commonwealth of individuals? Isn't this now a characteristic of the society he founded?

In Sweden and I think Germany as well, nationalism isn't really seen as something good, even on the verge as racism. Unless done for sport. Perhaps in England the nationalism is spread out more and not as focused on sports. One difference (though I can't speak for Germany on this one) I have noticed while listening to 606 on BBC radio 5 after England matches. The English people who phone up say things like ""Hi Alan, I'm an England fan..."" as if it isn't implied. You're English, how can you not be an England fan? (I have heard of English people, Liverpudlians or Mancunians who don't actually support England) I can't imagine that happening here. Whether football, hockey, handball, tennis or curling. Whether you care about the sport or not. When it's a World Cup, World Championship, European Championship or Olympics. You support those who represent Sweden.

Then we have the English media. Every two years since 1966 you're written up as world champions, every two years the team has disappointed you. Even though you probably shouldn't be considered among the favourites every time. This has been done so many times and over such a long period of time people have just lost faith and started to resent the whole thing. This year for example, some key players come off bad seasons. The goalkeeper that played most matches finished last in the league. With all unrest (Terry and ACole public affairs). This perhaps wasn't one of those years you could actually be considered favourites.

While I'm sure the German papers would be just as ruthless, the last time Germany WEREN'T in the quarter-finals at a World Cup was 1938. 72 years ago. The same has happened to England twice in the last four World Cups (and in 1994 you didn't even qualify).

**China, the Sweatshop**


*Published: July 5, 2010*
 

The labor strife spreading through China’s factory cities has clearly frazzled the government. Last month, it deployed Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, a k a “Grandpa Wen,” who told laborers at a Beijing subway station that the government and society “should treat migrant workers as they would their own children.” 


China’s exploited workers don’t need an extra parent. They need higher wages, better working conditions and a chance to form independent unions. They need China to stop being sweatshop to the world. 


Worker unrest has spread after reports of suicides at two campuses in southern China owned by Foxconn Technology, an electronics maker that employs 800,000 people in China who assemble products and parts for Western companies, including Apple, Dell and Hewlett-Packard. Since May 17, workers struck at three Chinese plants that make transmissions, exhausts and locks for Honda, the Japanese carmaker. There also have been reports of labor action in dozens of other factories. 


Working conditions in too many of these factories are dismal, and the pay is, too. At the Pingdingshan Cotton Textile Company, The Toronto Star reported, workers make 65 cents an hour, working grueling two-day shifts, often in 100-plus degree heat. Workers at Honda Lock demanded a 70 percent raise from their $132-a-month wage. There are 
no independent unions allowed. 


China, over all, has done well with its export-dependent strategy based on cheap labor and a cheap currency. Gross domestic product per person trebled over the last 10 years, to $7,200. The share of the population living on less than a dollar a day fell to 16 percent in 2005, from 36 percent in 1999. But China needs to move on. 


Too much of the country’s prosperity has been absorbed by companies’ profits. Too little has gone to workers. Partly as a result, consumer spending in China amounts to merely 36 percent of its gross domestic product. In the United States, that percentage is more than 70 percent. In Europe and Japan, it is almost 60 percent. 


China’s manufacturing sector can afford to pay higher wages. After the suicides, Foxconn suggested moving production of some Apple products to newer facilities in North and Central China where pay is cheaper than around the manufacturing hubs along the coast. But it also doubled wages at its Shenzen campus — to about $290 a month. 


Rising wages and better working conditions are essential for China to become a more self-reliant economy, powered by domestic consumption. Until it treats its workers better, it has no chance of becoming a just and stable society.

Moving into influenza decimated villages and stealing the rest from native americans is not really the rugged individualism you think you're promoting. 

Social programs work in Europe because the population has a uniform ethnicity and everyone at some level realizes the entire population is people and not animals to be ghettoized and avoided as much as possible. 

The reason social safety nets don't work in america, is that the safety nets don't really solve the issue of society being unwilling to give people of certain ethnicities in those safety nets a chance to get out.  So they languish in the safety net. General public sentiment grows ever more noxious about the visually identifiable group and the burden of supporting them while at the same time denying them a chance to get out and the whole mess continues. 

You're far more likely to find reformed ""criminals"" of a certain race back in the workforce than others, and you're far more likely to find members of a certain different race actually getting prosecuted and jailed over petty offenses and blemishing their record.

The comparison between cigarettes and cocaine is sound on the surface, but you are neglecting one issue.  Tobacco can be grown and produced in a variety of climates; Many states in the US are capable of growing sufficient quantities of tobacco for cigarette production..  This enables that industry to be regulated by municipal, state, and federal authorities.

The coca plant, on the other hand, has a very limited range of climates that it can be adapted to. [Source 1](http://www.unesco.org/most/news9c.jpg) and to paraphrase another source, coca production *might* be possible around San Diego, CA [Source 2](http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=31690)

One small region of the US would be unable to produce enough to satiate the desires of an entire country.  It requires a substantial amount of coca leaves to produce a kilogram of cocaine.  I'm unable to find a entirely reliable source, but I've seen estimates ranging ~30kg to yield 1kg of cocaine powder and as high as the 100s to produce a single kilogram.  This has led to [deforestation issues](http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/blog/2010/03/24/coca-production-deforestation-and-climate-change/) within the countries that are best known for producing the drug (ex. Colombia) due to both demand stateside and in Europe, and a need for more hectares of land to produce just the plant.

So, if we were to legalize cocaine, who would be our source? We'd have to rely on the [relatively corrupt governments of South America](http://4loves.com/links/corruption-world-map.jpg) to regulate its cultivation.  A lot of that corruption stems from the drug trade, and legalizing it stateside could potentially heighten those levels of corruption.  The manpower required for it's cultivation is a whole different story all together.

So, aside from the addiction aspect, which we both agree can be curbed by proper education, we'd be opening the floodgates to a whole host of other issues that potentially put other countries at risk.

To do what you are suggesting, we'd need a world-wide revolution in how we view drugs in our societies.  That is a pretty tall order.  I'm a realist, and I imagine it'd be a difficult thing to do.

if you look at it in a historical sense, instead of an anti america agenda, you might find that there are more wars than those over oil, and america has different allies than those who produce oil. and different enemies.

list for me the allies of america if you will.


list for me the ""enemies""

list which ones have struck oil. 

why would we make enemies with someone who has oil? if that were the only factor, we would be allies with everyone who has oil.  the wars we wage have only raised oil prices.  a strikingly different ending than you would have us beleive, isn't it?

anyone can look at a small amount of facts, and determine things. it seems like you are trained somehow to do only that.

europe decides who it's allies/enemies are based solely on convenience, and nothing else. it's true. remember when they decided to befriend the communist russians in world war 2?

do you see how that, while it presents one fact, is outright false as a complete statement? 

it's important that america wage certain wars. it's good policy. the last time we outright ignored problems in unstable area's of the world,  upwards of [60 million people died.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties)
before that we ignored problems, and had a ""war to end all wars""

it's our business to be in these parts of the world. lest we get involved when it's too late, like we did in iraq (after the genocide of hundreds of thousands of kurds) like we did in afghanistan (after the groups they were housing openly, and effectively attacked the United states)
like we probably will be in iran. 

next question, why did we not step in when the other genocides happened? 

you might look to oil here if you wish. if there is a choice of whether to attack country ""a"" who had pulled us into wars with it in the past, and has oil, or country ""b"" who will not benefit us, but has the exact same problems, then yes. oil may have helped decide which threat to our nation to address first. especially when a more ""rich"" nation, has more power against us when there is a real threat to liberty from them. 

america cares about 1 thing?   that's an ignorant statement by a retarded douche with an anti american agenda.

to defend such a statement shows a lack of critical thinking, a lack of understanding of history, foreign affairs, and america it'sself. yes, i think it' safe to say, that on this particular subject, you too, sir, are ignorant.

I traveled by myself for about six months starting around the end of september last year and finished up back in march this year. Granted, I'm a 26 year old male, but I'm not physically intimidating by any means. I did two months in Europe and spent the rest in northern Africa, the western part of the middle east (Israel and Jordan), southeast Asia and Australia/New Zealand.

I met plenty of solo female travelers along the way though, as well as made friends with other solo travelers, both male and female, that I spent big hunks of time with since we were both alone and in the same place for a somewhat extended period of time.

You don't have to worry about anything bad really happening as long as you're smart about what you're getting into. Most of the ""close call"" incidents I had would probably not even apply to solo female travelers because they were of a nature that would seem to cater to male tourism more.

You will make friends along the way. I'm assuming you will be in the hostel environment whenever it's possible. Those are great places to make short-term or even long-term traveling buddies. You just have to be cautious of the people you meet, but don't take a chance away from people because they happen to be of the opposite gender.

One quick example: I started off in Ireland and had made my way around the country a bit before working back towards Galway on the west coast. I didn't find anything particularly fascinating about the city, but I did hear that the music and nightlife there was pretty good. So I went out for a night on the town by myself. I hadn't met anybody at the hostel, so I went and had dinner by myself and walked around the older part of town in search for a pub with some good local music hoping to meet some new people for the time I would be there.

I went to a place with a really good live band, it was some mix of like nuwave, progressive rock and traditional Irish music. Really strange, but they rocked. Anyway, I was drinking at the bar by myself and there was this pretty cute girl there who seemed like she was by herself. I didn't want to seem creepy by approaching her, so I just kind of melted into the crowd for a bit. But, eventually I saw she was casually glancing at me over and over and no one was talking to her.

So I started out with, ""Hey, the band's pretty good, yeah?""

At the end of the day, we're both headed in the same direction and she tells me she has rented a vehicle for the time she's spending in Ireland (that's the only country she was traveling in). She's a bartender in NYC (I'm from CT, and yes, we've met again since) and visiting some friends of friends she has back home or something like that. We agree to travel with each other for the next four or five days before I had to head off to Paris, and to save on money, we sleep in a shared room (2 beds) at B and B's and split the costs on dinner, entertainment and gas and all that jazz.

Nothing ever happened between us except for good conversation, some jokes about the locals and some really fun times.

Then there was Rikimah, whom I met in Dublin, a 23 year old black girl from D.C. who does a lot of solo traveling around Europe, even in the more ""dangerous"" eastern countries (I have been there as well).

You'll be fine as long as you keep your wits. If something happens like what you read about in the papers or in the movies. It was probably your own fault or it was just destined to happen. That shit doesn't happen on a daily baiss. I played by the same rules (for the most part) that solo females should. Don't let your drinks out of sight, if you accept a drink from a stranger make sure you have your eyes on it and the server/bartender while it's being made, keep your belongings secure, and don't let your guard down.

I would've loved to have a companion to travel with, but I made my friends along the way. The jokes are shared between us (it's easy to keep contact on facebook these days), and I made a lot more friends than I probably would've had I been with a friend or a group.

This is largely because immigrant populations, when they emigrated to the United States, tended for a time to live among / work with / support others from the same background.  While true elsewhere, I question whether or not this experience wound up defining cultures the way it has here.  That is to say, it is not so much that immigrants in the US assimilated - they met the culture half way and brought their own foreign cultures with them, in ways which changed US culture as a whole.

My own experience is an example.  My family came here from eastern Europe in the early 20th century, and until a few years ago when it was torn down, they all still went to the Slovak Catholic Church (this is an ordinary Roman Catholic church with Slovak language hymns, and so forth).  

Across the street was an Irish Catholic Church (same thing - Roman Catholic but with Irish songs, traditions, etc.).  In each case, the Church formed a kind of cultural link both to ones past and to immigrant communities who supported each other, loaned money to each other, helped get each other employed, in the early days when they first arrived on US shores.  Then their children grew up in that tradition and so on.  I grew up going to Easter Sunday mass with foreign-language hymns and eastern european culinary traditions, even though I'm pretty much as modern-day American (my parents and grandparents, too) as it is possible to be.

As time went by the ethnic subcultures seeped out and melted into the larger culture.  We celebrate this heritage *in the context* of being Americans.  Being an American, for many people, involves the integration of American principles, ideas, and traditions, with our ethnic heritage.

Nowhere is this more obvious than the way we celebrate St. Patrick's Day, no matter what our background.  This is not a celebration of modern Ireland so much as a celebration of the contributions and influence of Irish immigrants of the past, who contributed dramatically to creating what is modern America (mostly refugees from the potato famine).  Each of these immigrant communities imprinted and changed American culture for everyone.  If you're Catholic in the northeast, no matter what your background, you are more than familiar - even at home - around Italians and Irish food and possibly songs, as a product of this. 

This is, definitionally, what being an American is.  We don't have our own race, nor thousands of years of history (except for native Americans).  While there is immigration everywhere, few countries have been so exclusively defined by immigration as the United States is.  To ignore this or to downplay it would simply be to ignore or marginalize a vital aspect of who we are.

I don't have any affinity for my own ethnicity.  I have been far more influenced by the UK in terms of its cultural exports than by Polish, Slovak, and Russian things (have very little affinity for the food or culture of any of these - don't have anything against them but they don't do it for me).  I grew up eating Italian food and wearing green every St. Patrick's Day.  I am comfortable in ethnically Italian and Irish homes, possibly even more than Polish, Slovak, and Russian ones: it what is familiar.

I like this aspect of being an American.  But it is not the same as ""claiming nationality.""  It is claiming ethnicity, within the context of our own country - ""we're green team and we brought you St. Patrick's day.""  ""We're the white, green, and red team and we brought you pizzerias on every corner!""  It is an understanding of where our ancestral traditions were incorporated into, and wound up defining, the American experience for everyone.  New York City is demonstrative of this with its ethnic festivals, Little Italy, St. Patrick's Day Parade, and so on.

Historically, funding of macro-scale economic projects was tied to the existing wealth, e.g. gold or land. This put severe limits to development, even though governments tried to cheat by debasing the currency, etc. Such limits were the reason for the famous attacks on the gold-based currency claiming that it nails the economy to the 'cross of gold'. Fiat currency, on the other hand, allows for both easy financing of important infrastructure projects, and for financial profligacy leading to excessive debt. 

Constant growth traditionally masked the overspending and debt----properly managed, deficit spending and constant growth reinforced each other, and were quite successful for modern western nations. We still have to figure out how to manage national finances and economy with small or negligible growth---where is the money going to come from?

Switzerland is a great example of how to play it safe. They have a policy that 20% of their reserves is in gold---so their budget is forced to be prudent in the long term, as if they currency was indeed gold based, but they don't sacrifice deficit spending if they need it.

 There's a great historical paper  www.independent.org/pdf/working_papers/44_international.pdf on first 250 years of banking (1250 to 1500) showing how European powers managed their currencies.

I traveled around Europe, one country in Latin America, and some of Asia alone. You'll probably pick up a lot of the tips that I would give myself from other replies to this thread, so I'll just stick to some basics that I picked up from other people, and say: GO! There's no time like the young and present. 

- Stay in a hostel, rather than a hotel - the staff are usually local, trustworthy, and will have great suggestions for places to eat, hang out, see, etc. You'll also meet other solo travelers who you can spend a day with sightseeing or hang out at night with, but who you'll have no huge obligation to travel with further. This was the greatest perk for me, because exploring alone can be quite boring. 
- Couchsurfing.org is a great resource, and I had some of my funnest experiences through meeting hosts and having them take me around cities they love. Like all online sites, use your own discretion and common sense, and you'll find great (and safe) hosts. 
- I crosschecked hostelworld.com and Lonely Planet to make sure the hostels were in pretty safe, crowded, and accessible neighborhoods. 
- Invest in an internal frame backpack. I traveled with nothing but an internal frame backpack and a handbag over one shoulder. You'll have your hands free for buying tickets, handling your wallet, and opening maps, which is more convenient if you're alone and don't have anyone around to help you with your suitcase. This is also a great way to ensure you can fit everything valuable you have into a potentially small locker provided by a hostel and save on excess baggage fees.
- Make sure someone trustworthy knows your itinerary before you leave for your trip, and update them when you arrive to each notable destination.
- Do your research thoroughly (as I'm sure you would do, without anyone's advice) before you go and take into account the local culture. If your gut tells you you'd have trouble and be unsafe alone, your gut is probably right, and ensure that you have a travel buddy or a means to meet someone there. Though I can't really explain it, you will get a sense of the difference between pushing the limits of your comfort zone, and being in a situation that is actually dangerous.

&gt;Officially by whose standards? And so thousands and thousands of people immigrating and building farmland is an occupying force?

Do you know anything about history?

It's called UN Resolution 181, passed in 1948 just prior to the civil war. That is when Israel *officially* became an occupying force of another people's land.

&gt;There is plenty of actual history that could support a right for jews to be there.

No. There is no ""actual history"" to support foreigners invading another country. That is complete bullshit. If my ancestors were German - I cannot claim the right to move there with my entire family after 1000 years. That is sheer idiocy you're talking about. The only people with a right to stay in that land are the people who lived there for centuries, Jewish or Arab. And it just so happens that the Jewish population living there for centuries was only a few thousand people.

&gt;Did you miss the slavery thing?

Which is it? Do you want to accept Jewish history as historically accurate or not? Or is the slavery and victimhood the only things you'll accept as fact?

&gt;The odds of this are small, given the wide variety of places jews have lived and the over-all lack of full scale assimilation. 

That is because they were a discrimnated minority in Europe. Such groups have a tendency to become inward and isolated.


&gt;The various Canaanite tribes would have at least occasionally intermarried with the Israelites and therefore both Palestinians and Jews could make a claim as descendent from the original occupiers of the land.


NO. For the 500th time. The Jews who immigrated to Israel in the past 80 years DO NOT have a valid claim to a right to that land. The Palestinians are STILL THERE - they never left. They are in refugee camps for God's sake. To argue that some Jewish kid from Brooklyn whose parents are Americans, whose grandparents were Polish, and whose ancestors for the past 1000 years or more were Eastern European has an equal right to the land of Palestine as a Palestinian kid born in a refugee camp whose parents were from Ramallah, whose grandparents were from Ramallah, and whose ancestors for the past 1000 years or more were from Ramallah - is racist at best and just plain stupid.

Just because this Jewish kid from New York may have an ancestor from Canaan does not give him any more of a right to move there than anyone else. Palestinians have this right because they still have the goddamn keys to the houses they were expelled from.

Secondly, you are basing that entire argument on an assumption that at some point some Canaanites intermarried with Jews. So what?? Thomas Jefferson has DNA links to Phoenicians - ie. Canaanites. That doesn't give his descendants any more of a right than anyone else to move to Palestine.

You are not understanding the argument - whether people have Canaanite blood or not has nothing to do with it. What matters is that Palestinians have always lived on that land from the dawn of time, they didn't leave for 2000 years and then claim some fictional ""right"" to return.

The only people with a right to that land are the Jews from pre-Zionist Palestine, and the Palestinian Christians and Muslims.


&gt;I never said that, I just said both groups can create equally good cases for historic claims to the land and given the modern history of it, both are mostly irrelevant. 


Both are mostly irrelevant?? Are you fucking retarded?? Do you know anything about history?? There are millions of Palestinians who are right now displaced from their homes living in refugee camps in the Gaza Strip, Jordan, and in Lebanon. The Jews arriving from Poland and New York and move to the settlements in the occupied West Bank have no right to do so whatsoever.

If I convert to Judaism today, does that give me more of a right to move to Israel than Palestinians?

The point is that Zionism is a racist ideology and I am not basing my judgement on religion - I'm basing it on who has been farming that land for generations and who were illegally forced out of their homes 60 years ago. A Polish Jew whos great great grandfather converted for whatever reason to Judaism, or married a Jewish woman, does not logically nor morally have the same rights to that land as Palestinians do, nor should he have MORE of a right to move there.

My parents were vikings who lived in Scotland 1000 years ago. They were kicked out at some point. I claim my right to move back, along with all of my relatives and extended family. Not only that, I demand that the nation-state my ancestors ran in Scotland during that time be reinstated and the name and government of Scotland be removed.


And let me give you another analogy:

My ancestors were Jewish, I know this for a fact. My father converted to Christianity and I was born a Christian - can I claim my right to move ""back"" to Israel? Yes or no?",1278449915,c0tnewo,,kerat,True

The grant was denied, and wikileaks got all butt-hurt and posted some articles claiming a conspiracy against them.

We're all being played by someone who doesn't even know how to do PGP right, and thus puts all of his sources at risk.

Here are some highlights from a wikileaks mailing list from before the site was launched:

&gt;Date: Sun, 07 Jan 2007 06:58:04 -0800

&gt;[This is a restricted internal development mailinglist for w-i-k-i-l-e-a-k-s-.-o-r-g. Please do not mention that word directly in these discussions; refer instead to 'WL'. This list is housed at riseup.net, an activist collective in Seattle with an established lawyer and plenty of backbone.]

&gt;Announcing a $5 million fund-raising goal by July will kill this effort. It 
makes WL appear to be a Wall Street scam. This amount could not be 
needed so soon except for suspect purposes. 

&gt;Soros will kick you out of the office with such over-reaching. Foundations are flooded with big talkers making big requests flaunting famous names and promising spectacular results.

&gt;I'd say the same about the alleged 1.1 million documents ready for
leaking. Way too many to be believable without evidence. I don't believe the number. So far, one document, of highly suspect provenance.

&gt;Instead, explain what funding needs there are and present a schedule 
for their need, avoid generalities and lump sums. Explain how the funds 
will be managed and protected against fraud and theft. 

&gt;Instead, operate on a shoe-string for a few months, best, for a couple
of years, establish WL bonafides by publishing a credible batch of 
documents for testing public feedback and criticism. Show how to 
handle the heat of doubt and condemnation. Use that to support 
fund-raising.

&gt;At moment there is no reason to believe WL can deliver on its
promises. Big talk no action, the skeptics say.

&gt;Addendum:

&gt;**The CIA would be the most likely $5M funder. Soros is suspected
of being a conduit for black money to dissident groups racketeering
for such payola.**

&gt;Now it may be that that is the intention of WL because its behavior 
so far fits the pattern.

&gt;**If fleecing the CIA is the purpose, I urge setting a much higher
funding goal, in the $100M range and up.** The US intel agencies
are awash in funds they cannot spend fast enough to keep the
Congressional spigot wide open. Academics, dissidents, companies,
spy contractors, other nation's spy agencies, whole countries, are 
falling over themselves to tap into this bountiful flood. But competition
is fierce, and accusations of deception are raging even as the
fleecers work in concert.

&gt;Chinese dissidents -- a brand name among many -- are already 
reaping huge benefits from covert funding from the US and from 
the PRC, along with others in the former Soviets, in Africa and 
South America, inside the US, UK and Europe, in the Middle East 
and the Koreas, who know how to double-cross ditzy-rich Dads 
and Moms.

Edit: FUCK I mean just two lines down you claim GM crops cause cancer...

Furthermore, it is far from a monopoly issue. Despite what Reddit comments would lead you to believe, there are many companies that sell products using GM technology. Even just in GM seed itself there are several companies, Dow, Bayer, Pioneer etc.

&gt;These companies are trying to make you buy seeds that you already have for free. 

They aren't forcing people. Farmers buy these seeds (and hybrid seeds) because they work better. 

&gt;And preventing you from ever getting free seeds again. The GM are programmed to die after a generation. GM seeds will raise food prices killing 100's of millions of people not saving them.

There is ZERO link between GM crops and cancer. It ridiculous to even suggest it.

Look at that. Notice how European countries are above the united states in cancer rates? Remember how the EU banned GM crops for about a decade and only within the last two years approved them again? 

&gt;I would like to see what specific types of cancer are more likely to be caused by GM crops. 

Is it possible? yes. Has any evidence shown that GM crops cause cancer? No. None. Zero.

&gt;The GM crops don't use less fertilizer they have the fertilizer genetically programmed into the crop.

From this comment it is obvious you have no idea what you are talking about.

The all currently approved GM crops have nothing to do with fertilizer. However, the possibility remains open to reduce the need for synthetic (or even organic) supplementation.

Positive:
- The central bank (or whoever) could devalue the Punt, thus making our exports cheaper and would make us incredibly more competitive which is important in times like these.
- Our biggest trading partner isn't any EU country, or the EU at all. It's America, having a more competitive currency would only boost our trade with our biggest trading partner (and our second biggest - the UK). Which would see more money in the budget, and possibly job creation.
- We would again be able to control our rates, which I see as a good thing.
- The price of food and goods in Ireland would go down (I think..)
- Even if devaluing the Punt meant we were only 'masking our problems' it would still give us more time to pay off our debts and would loosen the stranglehold on the national budget. 

Negative:
- The newly re-established Punt would probably be heavily speculated against which could turn nasty. Theres a difference between having a de-valued currency and a worthless one. 
- People could find their savings and income virtually halved.
- Even though a currency changeover might not bring about any actual economic instability, the hassle of it all could spark fear that we were 'forced out of the euro' which could bring about another crushing double-dip recession.

Also, [here is the other side of the coin](http://www.bisphenol-a.org/) to OP's grassroots activists. Its run by the AmericanChemistry group who appear to be a joint effort between some big chemical industry companies.

Try to take everything with a grain of salt, just because something's written down and agrees with your point of view doesn't mean it's right. The FDA position is by far the closest to a scientific one, remember, they aren't pandering to industry by letting BPA use continue in products when it doesn't expose infants. There is no concern about effects on adults (but there is with teenage girls).",1278461583,c0tnwv4,,[deleted],True

I already named the Muslim Brotherhood, because that was a big one that stuck out in my mind, because they were chiefly against Western influence in Egypt, and used violence to (successfully) drive out the Brits.  [Read about them](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Muslim_Brotherhood_in_Egypt).  Links to Nazi's, assassinations, arson, inciting riots.  Mostly directed at British or their lapdogs in the Egyptian government.

Israelis have been the target of Arab terrorists since it's creation.  There were many acts of terrorism surrounding the various wars they've had in Israel over the years. Again, Google has plenty of dates from incidents in the 1920's (the attack on Tel Hai) on!

Take a middle eastern history class because it really is fascinating.  I took middle eastern history as well as the history of terrorism, because after I took middle eastern history, I found out the same professor taught terrorism and I just had to take it.  Arab terrorism is not by any measure a recent thing.  Nor did America alone create it.  We haven't taken enough measures to squelch it, sure.  It has a lot to do with how the Ottoman Empire was split up and given to European powers, and even after the West was driven out, we fought for oil concessions, and continued to use them as political tools.  

Then after working towards stirring up nationalist sentiment (usually required for a revolution of independence) and further uniting under the flag of Islam, we are left with independent states with varying degrees of fundamentalism, who in many cases are even resentful of each other's views on Islam and attack each other.


TLDR:  Just because there were no Arab terrorist attacks against Americans before 1968, doesn't mean terrorism wasn't alive and well in the region, even while we were meddling there the whole time.  Attacks were especially prevalent during that time against French and British.  We were on the list of targets, and perhaps the increased frequency of attacks on us has to do with globalization, the relative ease of acquiring weapons today, and our increased presence in the region.  The US stood by Israel since the very beginning.  Food for thought: 1968 was ONE year after the [six day war](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War).

&gt;That may also be true... but I didn't get the impression that the OP's remarks were implying racial/ethnic dishonesty. (unless I interpreted the original question wrong)

I dunno I've lived in various shitty neighborhoods and am white, so I kind of see both sides of the problem. 90% of rich white ppl seem to think black people love being on welfare and are usually specifically referring to black people when talking about welfare. They seem to forget that poor white people exist. At that point people usually start attacking the moral fortitude of welfare recipients and not socioeconomic conditions that are beyond their control. Which often has a lot of echoes to plantation owners criticizing the slave or indentured servant's work ethic. 

Seriously, every time there's an economic boom ghetto violence goes down, welfare rolls drop and you see more blacks with jobs, and being proud to work. I sincerely doubt the veiled references to moral fortitude that always sneak in, in these debates are innocent. There was far less of this kind of talk in most Great depression era accounts, mostly because white people weren't even expected to help out poor blacks doing even worse than the poor whites. 

Most of the accounts are of people pitching together and helping each other out, rather than questioning the moral fortitude of people who are down on their luck .


i dunno maybe it's my intellectual baggage and past experience coloring the OP's question and debate on why things don't work in america.

Sure it is.  Me owning a gun doesn't affect your face one bit.  In the US, millions - literally - of people own guns safely and responsibly and have for hundreds of years.  It really and truly isn't your business because it has zero impact on any of your rights.

&gt; I live in a country where government restriction of guns is accepted and supported by the populace.

It is accepted by a majority who force their prejudices on the minority.  This is neither more civilized, nor more enlightened.

&gt;  The 'mob rule' has decided that the risk to society of ubiquitous gun ownership outweighs individual liberty considerations.

Yes, the same happens in my country with the drug war.  It is equally nefarious.

&gt; A large proportion of Americans clearly disagree with this assessment and can't seem to fathom the thinking behind it.

Oh no.  No no no.  This is what you don't get.  We absolutely, positively, undoubtedly understand your point of view better than you do ours.  We are confronted with it daily because other Americans - a minority, thankfully - feel as you do.  It is not that we don't see risks and consequences to gun ownership.  It is that we don't paint everyone with a broad brush and equate law abiding, tax paying citizens with criminal gangs.  It is that we understand that the long-term risk of allowing ones government to be armed to the exclusion of criminals is historically a terrible idea.

We understand the concept most countries seem to follow which is ""rights are just a sort of privilege conferred by government"" and we watch this manifest in national firewalls and censorship, and other such things justified in the name of protecting the public interest.  That these same infringements occur here only makes our concern about firearms all the more potent.  We in the United States find it particularly remarkable that so many abroad - and here - would point out, at the drop of a hat, the various deficiencies of the American empire - both in terms of its lack of restraint in war, to the way it wantonly violates civil liberties, of say, prisoners of war.

We hear lots of dissertations on the way corporations control the US government, or how the US's ""hegemony"" is a dark thing.  And then in the same sentence, many of the same people believe it is perfectly reasonable for the same government they have spent so much time ranting out to be armed to the exclusion of independent citizens.

We understand fully the idea of ""ban guns and people will be safer.""  We understand ""it can't happen here.""   We find this a ludicrous and unwise fiction.

&gt; ""my rights are paramount, and any restriction on my freedom is automatically invalid and therefore to be rejected.""

I am saying precisely this.  And I am saying furthermore that this attitude is most definitely our strength and your weakness.

&gt; I guess my issue is simply that the right to guns is a very American-centric thought pattern.

*Recently*.  I don't know where you live but I'd wager than a hundred years ago your own countrymen would have found such attitudes toward what are inanimate objects superstitious and dangerous, and would have regarded being treated as an unstable, untrustable child insulting.  And given the many wars of that period, and documented abuses, I suspect that would have found the idea of governments armed to the exclusion of citizens unwise.

&gt; Most of the rest of the world just doesn't see it that way, and the automatic down-vote response just reinforces the stereotype of Americans as being insular and oblivious to anything outside their borders.

Again, this is really something you don't get.  We understand you.  We find your attitude toward this unwise.  American troops twice in the 20th century found themselves in harms way, risking their lives because Europeans were completely incompetent in handling their own affairs.  Obliviousness suggests we don't know that most of you are anti-gun.  We're well aware.  As for ""American-centric"" thought patterns, on this issue and in this context, you might as well call all of the west ethnocentric for being outraged by honor killings and stoning in other parts of the world.

The downvotes you receive are because you might as well be advocating censorship.  Or search and seizure without a warrant.  Or an end to due process.  We're well aware that foreigners don't see balancing power with the government as important as these things - that this is an extravagance or an eccentricity of Americans.  

We see your viewpoint as a prelude to the inevitability that again, as they have throughout history, governments - probably along with corporations - will forget their proper place in the relationship with their citizens.

And by the way, there is a big difference between this sentiment and hiding in the hills in shacks waiting for the gumbint to come.  This is a long-term outlook.  Empires fall, and states turn into tyrannies.  The way things are now are likely not the way they will always be.  And I would not have thought until this financial meltdown that there was a possibility I would see the change in my lifetime.

I'm sorry if the American-centricness of this viewpoint bothers you.  I don't apologize for my lack of tolerance for censorship, and I don't apologize for it when it comes to guns.  We are not enfeebled children who think of government and mommy and daddy who will always do the right thing in our interest.  We do not believe that freedom survives without teeth.  We believe power seeks nothing but its own expansion, and we plan to answer that with lead, should, god forbid, the time come.

&gt; The fact that the Muslims were so easily subjugated is because they were so backward.

You keep repeating the same Eurocentric garbage that I have already debunked numerous times. Please, drop this stupid tactic. There were many reasons for why the Muslim World fell to the barbarian European hordes and it has little to do with being backward. Among the many prominent factors are internal political bickering and infighting and moral prohibitions. The European barbarian hordes were simply more ruthless and barbaric to a degree Islam doesn't permit Muslims to be. And the Europeans barbarians equipped with the great Muslim advances in Science, technology and engineering created a brutal war machine which they plundered and raped the world with gaining a huge economic advantage. Other important reasons include the base and underhanded strategy of divide and conquer along with other deceitful, dishonourable tactics such as masquerading as friendly and peaceful traders, which the Europeans employed with great success especially in South Asia and the Middle East. This is a complex question with many factors and facets and to reduce it to just ""Muslims were backwards hurr durr"" just shows your brainless Eurocentric bias and utter lack of intellectual depth. 

&gt; If Europeans 'stole' Muslim science, why were the Europeans using airplanes while the Muslims were on horseback? 

Because Muslim societies had been completely destroyed, plundered and subjugated by then. Duh!


&gt; But what's not clear is why they are still so far behind today. 

Huge parts of the Muslim world still languish under American/Western hegemony and subjugation, especially the middle east with its rich oil resource. They are being deliberately kept undeveloped under undemocratic and repressive puppet and client regimes or through isidious economic and trade policies. The latter doesn't just apply to the Muslim World but to the entire developing world as a whole.

That in itself is not a problem. In fact it's a good thing. There's nothing wrong with seeking protection from the dictatorship you used to live in, or wanting to be reunited with your family. What is a problem is that a small minority of them will spend decades living there and not bother to learn a single word of the native language, rendering them incapable of the simplest of everyday tasks, like buying something at the supermarket or the gas station, speaking to government agencies, or even being able to go to the hospital or police station to report an accident or a crime. A poor or absent grasp of the native language also pretty much guarantees that you will never be able to find a decent job (unless you're lucky enough to work in a field that requires a language you already know anyway), so you're pretty much costing society far more than you're contributing and completely isolating yourself in your neighborhood. Also, often the reason why some of these people never learn the native language is because they aren't allowed to. I can't count the number of times at the immigration bureau I've seen men trying to get paperwork filled out for and sign their names on behalf of their wives because either: a) the wife has to wait outside in the hall and isn't allowed to come in or speak to the clerk; or b) the wife isn't allowed to learn how to read, regardless of the language. Maybe that's fine where they come from. But we didn't spend the past few centuries overcoming stupid bullshit like that for nothing.

I don't know how Denmark handles it, but in other EU countries learning the native language and taking brief courses about the native culture (and usually also about how women and children are, you know, human beings with constitutionally protected rights, how democratic republics work, etc.) are requirements after xx months of residency. And most of them take the course and pass it and that's great. The ones who don't face deportation. With no bonus.

And no, it's not specifically a West-East problem--I've seen many a European migrate to another European country, take a course in the native culture, and have the same difficulties grasping (to them hilarious) concepts like female truck drivers or teachers.

Racist actions, less certainly***]**.  Germany and France were historic enemies and Communism was very clearly a threat to the Prussian-ideals of the German state.  You can relate pretty much any military action in Europe to Germany's plan of strategic expansion against France and Russia.  Imperialism also accounts for the war in both Asia and Africa.

Of course I want my Senator to hear about this -- but he doesn't understand. He is too old and his time was before iTunes, Kazaa, Napster, or BitTorrent. 

You have got to be a pretty successful chap. More than likely you are a college graduate who actually absorbed something other than alcohol and it is obviously paying off with your position as an intern. I hope that you take your position seriously because as much as your job seems like the typical ""pay your dues"" type of job - its not. You have a golden chance to be a valuable voice for  something that is right, you have a chance to take part in change you can believe in. Because in all honesty if you don't voice your opinion on this matter why should anybody expect someone who is generations behind the the issue to?

I have many issues with this act. 

1) Why is our government protecting corporate interests?
2) The techniques that will be deployed in order to catch offenders are going to absolutely be a serious attack on our Civil Liberties
3) The punishment for this is extremely excessive

There is no doubt that this Anti Counterfeiting Trade Agreement will change the internet completely. It will become a felony to have any intellectual property ones computer without proper licenses. Currently it is a Civil Dispute which makes it the job of the ""hurt"" company to hunt, find, target, and sue offenders. With this Act the Government will take on that role. The Government will add millions to its costs to save millions for Corporate America that is pissed off that the consumers are buying fewer albums than they have to. Why will our Government use taxpayer money to protect corporate interests?

The techniques that are going to be employed are frightening and intrusive. I can tell you as a Computer Engineer that I could write a program that can tell if an iPod has any illegal music on it simply by plugging it in. And one can make that program work on laptops, PDA's, netbooks, portable hard drives. Not to mention that the parameters of the program can easily be changed to add more and more things to be scanned for. Imagine if airport TSA workers start to scan iPods as they see them. If illegal music is caught a Federal employee is notified and the traveler arrives to a quite unexpected welcome of federal agents and felonies. Or imagine if a TSA employee changes the search program to look for digital journal entries and emails them to himself for later entertainment. Not only will there be physical searches, which is clearly mentioned in the preliminary ACTA drafts released by the European Union, but there will also be extensive online monitoring. This will further expand an already large sector into a  HUGE one: data mining. Hackers are going to have incentives to write viruses, and anti virus companies are going to have incentives to ignore viruses and information is going to skyrocket in value. Due to these techniques:
1) Be subject to programs going through the data on our electronic devices
2) Have more doors open for privacy breaches
3) Create a monster in the room that is the internet which transform a benign environment into a savage, primitive one where everyone is out to capitalize: the data miners, the hackers, the FBI, and of course the IP holders.

Finally lets talk about the punishment. Seriously intern are you going to say that you never downloaded a song? Never bootlegged a movie? Did you ever save a picture that you didn't have permission to save? Now if you did do any of these things imagine how much difficult your life would have been if you had to deal with a felony due to your actions. I think you would agree when I say that a college degree would have been difficult to achieve with you running in and out of court or forking up a hefty fine. Also imagine what would happen to your political career if you are deemed unfit for office, jury duty, or gun ownership because like any other criminal you are a felon.

Take action. You are one of the few people on Capitol Hill that is still a free voice, ready to stand with justice no matter whose side its on. Don't stand by idly and allow the inevitable ruining of many peoples lives whose only crime is downloading a millionaire pop artists 3 minute one hit quit song.

At 52 Shalson is one of the UK’s most experienced entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and business investors. He first sold encyclopaedias, door to door, to save enough money for his first car. His first taste of success started in the mid 1970’s working as a clothes hanger salesman in London. Here his potential for making ‘it big’ within this industry quickly grew .

Braitrim was then a small manufacturing company making clothes hangers for the trade, which Shalson bought with a £10k down payment in 1978. The next 20 years saw Shalson build this small company into an international packaging manufacturing brand. In 1998 Braitrim was sold to Mercury Asset Management (a private equity arm of Merrill Lynch), for £85million, Shalson retaining a 20% stake of the company. He disposed of this holding in 2001 when Mercury sold Braitrim to ‘Spotless Group’, an Australian business service for £120million.

In 2004 Shalson expanded his ever growing business interests and investments and decided to venture into the pub industry. Initially acquiring approximately 20 pubs Shalson then built up a portfolio under the name ‘Pubfolio’- the biggest acquisition being 545 pubs in 2005 for an estimated £162.5million from Punch Taverns. Thus bringing the Pubfolio’s investment value up to £250m and some 800 pubs on their books. In 2004 Pubfolio ‘sprang from no where’ and became number 10 in the UK’s largest pub estate, the day to day running of such is done out of Country Estate Management whilst the directors of the company are focusing more deals in the City.

With the exception of the pub industry Mr Shalson has various other interests. In 2001 he founded ‘Brightview’ which focused his interest within the internet technology sector. Brightview quickly became the UK’s most successful privately owned Internet Service Provider and was sold in 2004 for £25m to Invox.

In 2003 he joined as Chairman for Consolidated Equity, which is a highly profitable, privately-funded company that provides 100% backing for property deals with professionals and entrepreneurs.

Mr Shalson’s next investment in 2005 was within the Sky TV market and acquired ‘PitchTV’ a television and online shopping channel business. The slogan for the company being ‘its’ clever, it’s simple, it works!’, Pitch TV focuses on selling several niche products , 24 hours a day seven days a week and since December 2009, Shalson has turned from Investor to taking an active role in the running of the company. In 2006, he also bought into two gaming channels and an entertainment channel.

In 2007 Peter Shalson bought the majority stake in TradIndex , which was founded in 2002 as an online spread bet trading platform. He re-branded the company as ETX Capital. Responsible for several hundred million £s of client deposits, ETX is constantly growing into a highly regarded financial spread betting company within the City and offers clients’ access to 1000s of global instruments from a single trading account over the phone or online.

In 2007, Peter Shalson was approached by 2 good friends who persuaded him to invest £2m into a new soft drinks business called Hopper, developing the new soft brew category. By the end of 2009 , soft brew was successfully selling in Marks and Spencer and in May 2010 it achieved a Waitrose listing. Shalson is convinced that The Juice Brewery (founding company) is destined for global success.

For personal interests, Shalson has devoted time to supporting and raising funds for a number of different charities, including the well-regarded Osteopathic Centre for Children, a special school for autistic children in London. Shalson’s biggest single donation is the £1.5 million sponsorship of ‘The London Academy’, a City Academy based in Edgware, which is a ‘non-selective, mixed, all ability Academy’ and is based in North London. Having been acknowledged by Ofsted to be the one of the most successful academies in the UK, rising from 9th from bottom in the national league tables ten years ago, is now achieving 63% of GCSE results with grades A-C. This places the academy within the top 10% of the national schools’results table. He is also a past member of the Development Board of the Prince’s Trust, also having served on the Advisory Council of the Trust with Sir Angus Ogilvy.

Another charity that Peter Shalson has been hugely active with is ‘The Presidents Club’. The charity mostly raises money for sick children, amongst other charities.
Under Shalson’s Chairmanship, the success of the charity has meant that it has been able to donate many millions of pounds to worthy causes. Shalson, when it comes to helping children’s charities is consistently generous and willing to give all the help he can. Recently working with the Presidents Club on the Royal Marsden Hospital to help build Europe’s leading Children’s and Teenage Cancer Centre. Going into their 26th year Shalson continues to give his support in every way he can to help those in need.

Outside of business and helping others, Peter Shalson lives in St.Johns Wood, London with his wife Polly and four daughters. He says that the most worthwhile thing he has ever done is to have built The London Academy, which continues to be dedicated to improving the lives of thousands of students from disadvantaged backgrounds by offering them educational opportunity and facilities that they would never have had the benefit of.",1278505478,c0tp5l0,,web-design-uk,False

I don't see that assumption. People in Africa need to eat. These are Motombo's potential customers. They can be in a market or a in a refuge camp it doesn't matter.

The more people who want to buy food the higher the demand and the higher the price for Motombo's crops and others. 

But US and European subsidies paid to their own (hard lobbying) farmers  reduce the natural price of the food staples. These are then sent to Africa. The aid groups are mostly not 'buying local'.

Now Motombo has fewer potential customers and the potential price for his crops goes down. It matters not that those customers sit in a refuge camp or are HIV positive. They are still people in Africa who need to eat, ie his customers.

These products have not been properly tested **at all** and there is a myriad of reasons that there should be a ban (in each country) or a halt on sales until they are proven to be safe for consumption.

The companies that create them have a solid history of poisoning humanity for profit and in no way can be trusted to regulate themselves.  

The GM crops aggressively cross pollinate with other crops letting untested *potentially* harmful genetics into heirloom and hybrid food.

Farmers have been driven into bankruptcy trying to fight off teams off lawyers for the companies claiming they are saving/steeling seeds.  Their only crime... their neighbor signed a contract, decided to farm GM crops, and their *actual eatable food* crops were tainted.  

The farmers who decided to use these seeds now face a 400%+ increase in their prices and less and less regular seeds are available.  This is bleeding farmers dry.

**Many many people do not want genetically modified food** and there are campaigns against it all over the world.  In north america GM foods are not properly labeled so there's no way for the consumer who does not wish to consume them to stay away from them.

There's more and more reasons but its pretty clear you should pull your head out of your ass and face reality.  People don't want GM crops and GM crops in use today have not; been proven to be safe, nutritious, haven't increased yields (with the exception of one type of rice) and are now becoming useless for their main purpose (being able to resist heavy doses of herbicide/pesticides) due to over 10 species of resistant weeds that have emerged.  

After only 10-15 years of using these crops in the US farmers are having to revert back to deep tilling, stronger herbicides, hand pulling and other labor intensive and environmentally damaging practices.

Obviously they need to protect their market from super cheep american soy/corn/cotton so their traditional farming base doesn't collapsible and get filled with GM crops. (witch would again eventually degrade/collapse their farms when the shit seeds become useless and over priced.)

But yea the EU just wants to protect trade against those shady African subsistence farmers.  It in no way has to do with protecting strains, local farmers from bad companies and public health....

*note* I'm not personally against genetically modifying foods if it is properly tested, and has real long term benefits, doesn't taint other crops and is properly labeled for consumer choice.  I am extremely against patenting genes, the companies that are currently in control of them, and the horrible practices and treatment of farmers around the world by corrupt, ignorant, criminal organizations like monsanto.

Basically, the extra costs of rental space and personell that an online retailer can save compared to a retail store is put towards some consumer safety. In the end, it is still a win-win, because it gives online shoppers a higher level of trust and confidence towards online stores, thus driving more revenue towards that distribution channel.

I was speaking that uniformly your cost have to be higher because businesses need to recoup costs from having to meet just those requirements alone. It's not a win-win, it's a loss of liberty for both the consumer and the vendor. You have no choice in the matter. The government has mandated that businesses must do meet arbitrary requirements for consumers. I have confidence in NewEgg because they have an excellent reputation, not because of some regulation.

&gt;Well, in Germany (and I believe in most of the EU) you do.

I'm sorry, I shouldn't have used the word inherent or even included fraud. Do you understand the concept of rights? Do you understand what a right is? You can't just arbitrarily claim something is a right (i.e. schooling or health care). While I believe in order for markets to function properly there needs to be heavy protection/punishment for fraud, you do not have an inherent right to be protected from fraud. I think a better phrase is government mandate.

&gt;Consumer rights are based on the concept that a commercial business does have an inherent advantage over costumers in case of disputes, due to size, experience and so forth.

Sounds like you need a better court system and more specialized lawyers. 

&gt;Anyone who has ever dealt with a vendor who didn't want to accept a refund for an incorrect shipment or added ridiculous restocking fees, knows what I am talking about.

Obviously for incorrect shipment it depends on the details. But, you're really going to complain about restocking fees? You realize it costs money to take back hardware, check for any damage, repackage, and reship? They clearly need to make up the money some where, I'd guess you're paying for it in one way or another. Regardless of what you may believe, you don't have a ""right"" to free things.

&gt;Hence, consumers need some form of protection, which is why we have consumer rights. It is basically a federally and legally suported BBB and it only applies to commerce between commercial and private entities. If you privately sell your stuff on Ebay, it doesn't apply to you. If you sell hard drives to another business commercially, it doesn't apply to you.

In other words, a group of legislators made a law claiming something is an arbitrary right that doesn't actually exist to infringe upon the liberty of both consumers and the vendors. Not only that, but on top of it these type of things only keep the big business shielded from competition.

&gt;And there is still the concept of customer service in Germany and you can choose your vendor based on that. It's just that I don't consider refunds in online shopping a part of customer service. Customer services is speed of delivery, response times, technical assistance, buying recommendations and consultations, personalization, customization, etc. You still need to research a buyer to make sure you get these things if you care about them, but you don't need to worry about basic decency in commerce and hidden fees.

That's fantastic, you have your own subjective views of what is good customer service, so does everybody else. Why not let people decide what they want and let the market accommodate?",1278514554,c0tpgr2,,satirical,False

People starving in refugee camps aren't the people buying grain, and the same goes for to people being hurt by AIDS.  The UN, and aid groups, aren't just going into the local market and setting up a kiosk with a big sign saying ""**FREE CORN &amp; TARPS**"", they're actually trying to provide food aid without bankrupting anyone, which include giving farmers free high grade crops to sell, to supplement profitability.  
The problem is, the people they have to sell and barter with don't have anything worthwhile to trade for.  Yeah, he can turn his beets into some chickens with trade, but Caterpillar wont give you a tractor for any number of chickens, and DOW doesn't deal with beets.  The only way to deal with these companies is by selling to an international market, so as to earn cash and credit in a strong currency.  This isn't possible, as 1) they don't know how to interact with an international market.  They don't have a telephone, or internet, access, or speak many of the languages, so  there is a good deal of difficulty in arranging a trade.  2) They can't ship their goods.  They have nothing near the infrastructure needed to send beets to England.  But that's largely irrelevant, as 3) no one would buy them anyway.  The US and EU have strict food safety regulations.  An African sustenance farmer probably can't meet the standards needed to sell in the US.  And even then, low-tech farming can, if they have a good year, yield a freight canister of food for our hypothetical farmer.  ConAgra can produce orders of magnitude more than that, for a far lower unit price, *before* subsidies.  
His products just can't compete in a market where he wouldn't be allowed to sell, that he can't get to, that he needs to sell to to get what he needs to do those things.  So he sells to local markets, and doesn't come out much better.  Then the UN comes in and gives some grain and rice to the destitute refugees, and some to him to, so that he can sell it.  Also: crapload of tarps.  I'll cede that the UN may be devastating the African tarp industry.  
Now, if he produces coffee, chocolate, or drugs, then people will come to him to get the stuff, pay decent money, and help ensure that it's fit for sale to the international market.  But now he's not making food, so he has to buy that too, and there's a decent chance that someone will come through, take all his stuff, and maybe kill him if he grows drugs.  

It's not just as simple as cutting aid so that he can prosper in his market.  The UN also has to try to prevent those his market can't support from starving and also try to bolster his market so that it can interact with the global one, and get actual profitable trade going on.",1278514591,c0tpgt5,,ricecake,True

&gt; he was the richest of the kids at school and probably the worst

Not surprising. Often the rich spoiled brats are the worst. You have to wonder about their parents, parents should be teaching their kids to not be douchebags. Parenting doesn't just stop at feeding and clothing your kid. Unfortunately what we're talking about is so pervasive that you can't rely on parents to know what is right/wrong.

I tip my hat to you for dealing with all this crap and not flipping out. Someday we'll have flying cars and color of the skin will not matter. One area that is skin neutral is computer programming. Some of the great programming role models of mine are black and they got into it *because* it doesn't matter what you look like, you code up a program and it either works or doesn't work. A number of the programs these racist people use when using unix were written by black people. The future requires everyone to not look at skin color so as to live in a true meritrocracy where your brain+hard work are the only things that matter. So I believe I am living in the future sorta and it's pretty cool. In the end, the free market will reward those who aren't racist so this will correct things, eventually. Of course the racist jackasses who don't hire the best and instead lose to competition can always sue.

&gt;*[...], the Partition Plan was neither just nor fair. Rather, it was oppressive. The Partition Plan granted 55% of
Palestine to the Jews, who at that time comprised only 30 percent of the population, and who owned a mere 6 or 7% of
the land. Within this Jewish State there were to have been 407,000 Palestinian Arabs. The Arab State was to
comprise only the remaining 34% of the land. The UN Partition Plan also ordered that the most fertile region, be given
to the Jewish settlers. The remaining 45% of Palestine was to comprise a home for the other 70% of the population
who were Arab. The major reason the Palestinians rejected the partition resolution was on the grounds of its lack of
fairness: it proposed to give the minority population an exclusive and hegemonic right to the majority of the land. In
1946, the total population of Palestine was 1,972,0000 inhabitants, comprising 1,247,000 Palestinians and 608,000
Jews, as well as 16,000 others. The Jewish population was composed primarily of foreign-born immigrants, originating
mostly from Poland, Russia and Central Europe. Only one third of these immigrants had acquired Palestinian
citizenship. With respect to land ownership, it appears from the government of Palestine's Village Statistics that the
**Jews then owned 1,491 square kilometers (exclusive of urban property) out of a total of 26,323 square kilometers in
Palestine. Thus, Jewish land ownership amounted to 5.6% of the total area of the country**. In contrast, the
Palestinians owned the rest of Palestine, including all the areas that were categorised as public domain. Moreover, the
territory allocated to the Jewish State included the coastal plain extending from Akka to Ashdod and other fertile lands,
while the Palestinians, an agricultural people, were left mainly with mountainous and arid regions.*

BP spokesman Robert Wine said he was aware of at least one ""big contract"" signed by the U.S. military after the oil rig explosion on April 20, involving the supply of multiple fuels for its operations in Europe.

Free trade does increase the amount of goods available; it does it for less too by utilizing comparative advantages. However, there are always externalities. This is often lost in strict economic analysis as more goods are available at a lower cost (i.e. opportunity cost). Moreover, one usually assumes that someone who is laid off can find a job.

As horrible as American labor law is, that in Asia is worse (China actually has excellent laws, as you would expect in a ""communist"" country, they just don't enforce them). Free trade, or to be more precise (in the U.S.), low trade barriers, allow this difference to be exploited. The question is no longer about Free Trade, but ""Fair Trade."" Agreements like NAFTA provide for complaints against unfair labor practice. This needs to be done more often. It does, however, need to be in a different form from the NAFTA system, which is hopelessly Byzantine. The reason that the EU works so well for the most part is that most of the countries involved all have similar labor standards. The only problems arise as you move farther East. Ask a German about Polish plumbers (and don't get them started on Turks). I am all for lowering trade barriers as long as the benefits do not come from exploitation. As soon as adequate labor laws are passed or enforced, then we will see the true benefits of free trade. Some cheap manufacturing should be done overseas. It is still difficult, however, to explain to a steel worker that it is cheaper to produce steel in China and ship it *across the Pacific Ocean*. That should never be the case.

That's not what I'm arguing.  I'm arguing that taking the model of biological evolution and using that as an explanation as to how religions have developed is faulty.  Do religions actually spread because they're more suited to the environment (cultural, sociological, etc.) than whatever religious tradition they supersede (what do we do about religions imposed by force? what about religions that spread from the top down? Or religions that refuse to assimilate to society?)?  Are polytheist traditions inherently less developed than their monotheistic counterparts, or their Buddhist counterparts as your example suggests (it's probably worthwhile to ask what ""more developed"" means in this context)?  If so, does that mean that those who are practicing Hinduism today are less developed than their Buddhist peers?

Failure to match evidence seems like a perfectly valid reason to reject a method.

I guess a form of [Intrinsic finality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_finality), yes. However, I would also say that this is derived from [philosophical naturalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_naturalism). I say that creatures, including humans, are bound by naturalistic laws. As a consequence of those laws, the chemical processes of which we are derived naturally lead to every aspect of our consciousness that implores us to survive. It probably could not be any other way.

&gt;this does not imply that every facet of our biochemistry is dedicated to sustaining the reaction. An organism is ""good enough"" even when it just happens to survive and leave offspring, even if not every facet of its chemistry is dedicated to its survival.

And that is enough! Sustaining the chemical reaction is the goal, not merely in the individual, but for the whole body of like reactions. If any first cell existed that was content to sustain only itself, and not reproduce, then even if it was immortal it would soon have been overrun by cells with a positive birth rate and enough time to achieve exponential growth.

 At some point, it became beneficial to give up uni-cellular immortality for a shortened life as multi-cellular chemical reaction. Perhaps it imparted some vastly superior capacity to propagate the chemical reactions. I wish we knew more about the Cambrian explosion.

Ultimately, I recognize that evolution is a slap-dash mechanism of ""whatever works"". This allows the existence, at the margin, of any number of potentially catastrophic weaknesses in the biochemical process of the individual. But as long as it is good enough to sustain the reaction overall, then it has succeeded.

&gt;Our brains are large and advanced enough that we humans can choose to abstain from sex, and/or use birth control to prevent ourselves from having offspring.

Once this was considered immoral, but in modern times we recognized that the human race was not in danger of extinction due to contraceptives.

However, part of the capacity of our consciousness is the ability to reason out higher-order survivability issues. If a disease wiped out 99% of humanity tomorrow, we would easily reason that contraceptives are no longer a moral alternative. ""My body, my choice"" would not stand up to the weight of the continuation of our survival.

Interestingly enough, birth rates are now sub-sustainable in many Western European countries. If not for immigrant influx, they would soon see a population decline.

The allure of a social networking site should be the benefits it offers to join:  the willful acceptance of targeted music, ads, and other information personalized for the user.  In this situation they are reaching beyond the ""services"" they offer and pushing them onto unwilling people well aware of their ""option"" to join or not.

It's not just the inconvenience of unsubscribing/deleting a spam email ""xxxx has invited you to facebook!"".  It's the fact that every time they reuse your name in a context outside of Facebook, it is breaching the privacy laws your friends signed up under.  

That said one's friends do have a responsibility to protect offline identities when they wield the power to post to a public forum.  Perhaps this needs to be stressed in the TOS and user agreement.

Collecting information on movies. products and music preferences is one thing that can add to the online experience of a member.

Collecting information on individuals outside of its network is overtly shady and circumvents the rights on a non-user to online privacy as a means to ensure consumer protection (as it seems to be recognized in Europe as told in the article).

The least shady way I could support active aggregation of non-member names and email addresses is as a database that is checked every time someone ""tags"" another or writes a proper name.  If it's a non member the last name is not displayed.

Of course, privacy protection will probably become a premium service one has to actually pay a monthly fee to maintain.  Who knows?

No it isn't, either in outlook or in composition.  China has changed an awful lot in the last 40/50 years, much as the US has changed or any European state has changed.

&gt;Not really. There's a public sector where the companies are owned and run by the state. Most of them make vast losses.  The Chinese private sector is more like Mussolini's Corporate State than state ownership. Private companies give party members well paid directorships.

Nope, the dividing line is nothing like as clear.  Many nominally foreign companies have state partners and many 'private' companies, including those in production and so on have the state as a major share holder.  I would agree that there is corruption, with officials taking pay and benefits from companies, but the distinction is still important.

&gt;It would make more sense to say that the companies own the state than that the state owns the companies.

No, it wouldn't.

No, no, no, no, no, you misunderstood the reference - this is an English drinking custom (why would a Portuguese person talk about the Bishop of Norwich?).

Although port is obviously a fortified wine from Porto, from the 17th century onwards, it has been associated with the British upper classes and in particular, London gentlemen's clubs. Various customs have grown out of this, to wit:

* Gentlemen only drink (red) vintage port. White port is common and only drunk by women and European types.
* Port is only drunk at the end of a meal (sometimes accompanied by stilton cheese or a cigar).
* Any ladies who were present during the meal withdraw (to the 'drawing room) leaving the men to get drunk and tell filthy stories.
* Port is always and only ever PASSED TO THE LEFT.
* You must not keep the port in front of you, but neither are you allowed to ask for it to be passed around.
* Hence, the ""Bishop of Norwich"" is a circumlocution/euphemism to alert the person who has custody of the port to stop being a bounder, and pass it on.",1278594441,c0tsam9,,Sabremesh,True

**Lod Airport Massacre, 1972**

On May 30, 1972, a three-man hit squad from the Japanese Red Army attacked civilians at the Lod Airport in Tel Aviv, Israel in an operation planned and supported by the General Command of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP-GC). Twenty-six people were killed in the massacre and 78 were injured.

**Kiryat Shmona (or Quirat Shemona), 1974**

On April 11, 1974, a team of three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine General Command penetrated the Israeli border town of Kiryat Shmona from Lebanon. Although they had apparently been instructed to take hostages, they instead entered an apartment building and killed all eighteen residents they found there, including nine children. The terrorists then barricaded themselves in one of the apartments and were eventually killed in an exchange of fire with Israeli forces.

**Tel Aviv Savoy Hotel, 1975**

On March 5, 1975 eight PLO terrorists arrived in Tel Aviv, coming by sea in a rubber dinghy, and landing without being spotted. They entered the Savoy Hotel and took dozens of hostages including a Dutch boy, 15, two Swiss, a Somali, and several Israelis. The terrorists barricaded themselves in the top floor of the hotel with the hostages.

Azmi Zrayir, a hero of the PLO, and Abu Jihad, one of the founders of ""Black September"", have been linked to this attack as organizers.

The terrorists demanded the release of their followers from Israeli jails. Israel Defense Forces started a rescue mission in the afternoon. Three IDF soldiers were killed and eight hostages wounded during the operation. At the end of the battle, the terrorists retreated to a room and blew themselves up when the commandos broke in. Seven terrorists were killed and one captured. Eight hostages were murdered and 11 wounded by the terrorists.

The Farmer’s Market on Fairfax and 3rd is a Los Angeles landmark, attracting tourists and everyday Angelinos alike, as well as many famous faces. Among the celebrities I have seen there are Muhammad Ali, Terri Garr, Tyra Banks, Laura Linney, Keenan Ivory Wayans, the guitarist for The Cult, Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, and Weird Al Yankovic.

But Ann Coulter is the only celebrity I’ve ever spotted at Farmer’s Market that I wound up fucking in the ass, hard.

It would be fair to observe that my feeling obligated to present the list of celebrities above in roughly Black-White-Black-White order is indicative of my own carefully Liberal sensibilities. And that this sort of conscientiousness is more than a little ridiculous, on examination. But what I notice about myself only on reflection, Ann Coulter seemed to recognize and respond to in an instant, like a puma recognizes an injured giselle. For Ann Coulter is a predator. A predator with a hungry asshole.

I first spotted her sitting at a table in front of The Gumbo Pot with another woman who looked not unlike her, but a generation older (I neglected to ask her at any point subsequently whether this had in fact been her mother). I vaguely recognized her—there’s always a lag time placing faces you know from cable when unconfined to a telescreen—and began to notice, stealing furtive glances up from the copy of Steinbeck I was reading, that she was eyeing me with unsettling scrutiny.

The next thing I knew, her companion (mother?) had left and Coulter was standing over me, looking skeptically at my reading material.
‘The Grapes of Wrath, huh?’
‘Yes’ I said, faking composure. ‘It’s fantastic.’
‘It’s a fantastic primer for vacuous proto-Communists everywhere,’ she said dismissively.
‘I don’t know about that..’
She sighed. ‘I don’t have enough ink in my pen to keep a running list of what you don’t know. May I?’
She motioned to the empty chair next to me.
‘Of course.’ It would be fair to say my voice trembled a little.
She sat and said nothing. Ann Coulter evidently takes an unappreciative view of small talk. That she was eager to continue antagonizing me became evident when I re-opened my recently-insulted book to resume reading. A young man passed in a t-shirt proclaiming ‘Iraq Nam’. She stopped him.
‘1. Haircut. 2. Shower. 3. Get a job, you sniveling hippy,’ she glowered. ‘You’re probably too high to remember that, so write it down--if you can write.’
He looked at her with dismay and scampered away like a kicked cat. She turned to me with bloodlust.
‘What do you think of the war: complete success, or very nearly complete success?’ she asked.
‘Well, in no time—barring the strong possibility of Civil War--we’ll have a democratically-elected anti-US Islamicist government in charge of the world’s second-largest oil reserves, so I’d have to say only very-nearly, on the complete success scale, at a hysterically distorted best.’
She showed her teeth. ‘It sounds to me like you don’t support our troops.’
‘I think that ‘Support Our Troops’ business is the most crass, craven cowardice ever to go unquestioned by the allegedly Liberal media.’
‘Yes? Yes?’ There was oddly growing excitement in her voice.
‘It allows the Administration to absolve itself of responsibility for its own flawed policy. It’s no different than if you sent a classroom of 2nd graders into a burning building, and when anyone objects you throw in their face that they ""don’t support our 2nd graders""’
‘Where do you live?’
‘A few blocks away.’
‘Take me there.’


When we got to my apartment, she looked around glumly.
‘I was thinking you’d have half-burned American flags up on the wall,’ she said, disappointed.
‘That’s ridiculous. I love my country.’
‘Whatever you think that means,’ she said, rolling her eyes. ‘Don’t you have anything nasty to say about the President?’
‘Like what?’
‘Like he’s an imbecile, or corrupt, or a corrupt imbecile—the usual sore-loser bitter chatter.’
‘To be honest, I didn’t like the nasty things that were said about Clinton, and I’ve decided to have respect for the Office, no matter who holds it. I don’t think President Bush is corrupt or an imbecile anyway. Would you like something to drink?’
‘I think maybe this was a mistake,’ she said, starting to go.
‘That’s not to say I don’t disagree strongly with many of his policies and objectives.’
She seemed to reconsider. ‘Like what?’
‘I don’t know. Name one.’
‘Get me a drink first.’


With every point I expressed that ran counter to a view she held, she removed one article of clothing. Soon she sat on my couch naked, gently pulling at her untrimmed pubic hair, staring intently but not quite invitingly at me. The growing hard lump in my throat was just outpaced by the one in my pants. I was a little nervous because we had agreed on the last two points—the need to reconsider the option of nuclear energy, and drilling in the Arctic—and I noticed her oversized nipples were no longer hard. Luckily, she was, by this point, determined.
‘What do you think,’ she began provocatively, ‘of the President’s plan to privatize Social Security?’
I sighed with relief; this was as sure a promise to seal the deal as her asking if I had a condom.
‘I think it’s a payoff to the Americans the President has always been most intent on pleasing: the richest 1%.’
‘What do you mean?’ she cooed. I noticed her nipples hardening once more. She dropped to her knees in front of me. She pushed me backwards and positioned my legs up in the air.
‘A stock’s value is even now only partially tied to the actual value of any publicly traded company. But who’s going to profit from inflated valuations when stock prices swell irrationally from the forced, artificial injection of capital?
Her breath was hot on my ‘taint as she lifted my scrotum. ‘Yes? Yes?’
‘You might as well shoehorn billions of dollars into the Baseball Card market. The price of a Derek Jeter rookie will be driven up to hundreds of thousands of dollars—before the bubble bursts and the whole market crashes massively.’ It was getting hard to stay on point as she tongue-fucked my shitter vigorously.
‘Don’t..Stop!!’ her contorted mouth pled from my butthole.
‘The top 1% will sell stocks at the inflated valuations to the novice investors-by-necessity, the market will swell and crash, and the same 1% will come back and re-purchase their holdings at pennies on the dollar. Meanwhile, Social Security will go bankrupt and all the novice investors will be eating catfood for the duration of their ""golden years,'’ barring a massive Federal bailout several hundred times in excess of what the Savings &amp; Loan scandal cost us.’
She sprung up on the couch on all fours and looked over her shoulder at me. She pointed to her twitching, puckered anus. ‘See this?’
I nodded eagerly.
‘I want you to wreck it.’
I spit on my skeezer-pleaser and, prying her ass cheeks apart like a hot dinner roll, drove it home, into the biggest browneye I had ever seen. She gurgled contentedly. Every thrust of my babymaker was met with a wrenched squeal as I grabbed her by the hips and began really leaning into it.
‘Harder!’ she begged, ‘Harder!! Tell me what you think of Chomsky!’
‘I..think..he’s..brill..iant..but..I..don’t really agree with much of his stance on Israel, and--’
‘You’re slowing down!’ she snapped. ‘DON’T SLOW DOWN!’
I went back to punishing her asshole, giving no thought whatsoever to compassionate conservatism as her chocolate socket gnawed on my pork pipe. She was babbling now, as out of a delirious reverie.
‘Feed it,' Ann Coulter rasped. 'Feed my hungry asshole!'
I buried her face in a throw pillow and she swiveled her hips back on my fuckstick with obvious appreciation. My pace quickened as my man-magma built towards eruption.
‘Wait!’ she gasped, sensing the fuse on my yogurt cannon was burning quick. ‘I want to take you ass-to-mouth!’
I withdrew from her puckerhole with an audible ‘pop’ and she scrambled around, gulping at my wang-dang-doodle as though the lives of all her loved ones hinged on her marks for enthusiasm. Her eyes rolled up pleadingly as she threw her head down again and again on my magic johnson. I knew what she wanted.
‘There is a specter haunting Europe,’ I began, and she started to convulse spasmodically with her own thrashing orgasm, her head now dribbling in a blur against my groin. I repeated every Karl Marx quote I could think of until I reached my own ‘historic inevitability’ and launched surge after surge from my hairy boda bag. I ejaculated with what seemed like enough force to blow out the back of her head--but her head was made of stronger stuff. She sputtered, gobbled and gulped what I’d have to call a very liberal, even radically so, quantity of hot splooey.
Once she caught her breath, she wiped her mouth, stood, and took me by the hand.
‘Let’s go to the bathroom.’
‘Why?’
She seemed surprised I had to ask. Her tone was that of someone reminding another of something too obvious to need mention.
‘Uh, so I can get in the tub and you can piss all over me?’



I sat in a robe and watched her as she dressed.
‘Will I see you again?’ I asked tentatively.
‘Sure,’ she said, pointing to the TV. ‘On that.’
Some moments passed. I tried to dispel the awkward silence.
‘Well, nice meeting you,’ I offered.
‘You’ve really got a gift for tedious small talk,’ she shot back.
I was a little hurt and, recognizing this, she softened just a shade as she reached for her purse to leave.
‘Hey.’
‘Yes?’ I asked.
‘Thanks for not staring at my adam’s apple.’
‘No problem.’
She let herself out without another word, and I sat in the late afternoon silence alone. I considered how it felt to be a disposable instrument in someone’s personal debasement fantasy.

All in all, it didn’t feel too bad.

It depends. If you're expecting perfect English, forget about it.
Almost every person below 30 knows or understands some English. It may be difficult for you to get along if there's a lot of older people around you.
On the other side, we've some genetic proneness to not speak in Portuguese when someone who doesn't speak it approaches us, so we try our best to speak in English.

I didn't know but a quick search showed me that the average full time wage for private consumption is Portugal is $18,300 (yearly) and that 
&gt;The World Bank reports that in 2001 per capita household consumption (in constant 1995 US dollars) was $8,223.
