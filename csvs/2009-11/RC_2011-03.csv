I want to make it quite clear that I have nothing but respect and even some admiration for India, Indians and all Asians for that matter.  When I get a pimple on a body part normally left uncovered, it stands out like an Orthodox rabbi at Tahir Square.  Darker skin hides blemishes to some extent, so at the very least you don't get mocked from across the street.  Lucky bastard.

Speaking of Indians and Asians, you expressed curiosity at the history behind the two terms.  I'm surprised you don't know the story.  I'll tell you.

&gt;Once upon a time, there was a handsome white man named Marco Polo who swam to China with his eyes closed.  When he arrived, he asked the Emperor ""What do you call this place?""

&gt;The Emperor replied ""Well technically, you're in Asia.  But specifically, you're actually in a suburb of Beij-""

&gt;""Asia, you say.  Alright, I'm writing that on my map right now"" declared Mr. Polo.

&gt;And so it was that Europeans learned to use the word ""Asian"" to refer to anyone from the Pacific Rim, except Australian aborgines of course who were dirty wogs.  But that's not important, because Australian aborgines are merely footnotes both to this story and to world history in general.

&gt;Several hundred years later, some intrepid British sailors got lost and wound up in Delhi harbour, or as it was known at the time, ""Calcutta.""  Desperately short on food and fresh water and encouraged by their absolute belief in nonviolence, cultural sensitivity and fair trade, they exchanged some shiny beads and Led Zeppelin albums for a few handfuls of tea, pepper and indentured servants.  As they departed, they asked the local chief ""What do you call this place?""

&gt;""This is actually Kumar's house, but I think the word you're searching for is 'India'"" the chief answered.

&gt;Years later, after many expeditions had been sent to both China and India, someone realized that they were actually on the same continent.  ""Fuck!"" yelled Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, ""We've already printed all the fucking maps!""

And that's why we have two terms for the citizens of a single continent.  Glad I could be of some assistance.

T. Danson considered in 1857 carefully the ""[c]onnection between American Slavery and the British Cotton Manufacture,"" he concluded that ""there is not, and never has been, any considerable source of supply for cotton, excepting the East-Indies, which is not obviously and exclusively maintained by slave-labour.""11 The United States and American slavery were thus at the core of the cotton industry and the emerging industrial capitalism.

What I wanted to draw was a distinction between slavery that results from warfare, and warfare that results from slavery. I've been told that the latter is what happened when triangular trade kicked into full swing. But there's the problem of overdetermination. It seems like there are far too many causes to make a truly unarbitrary and unbiased judgement as to what or which are the most relevant causes. Also Africa has many many problems, if we speak in general about them there will always be many more factors that could be taken into account because there is no singular cause for any of those problems, let alone one cause for all of them.

You would never allow some random user permission to install third party software they need on the terminal server they share with dozens or hundreds of other users, but with VDI, you can give them more access because what they do affects only that person. 

To give you some answers on media-rich applications, it is still not recommended to try to replace 3D graphic machines with a VDI solution. While the new technologies (PCoIP for VMWare, HDX for Citrix) do provide near-native performance on flash video and general usage, it's still no replacement for a strong video card for people using AutoCAD, etc.

Most of my experience is with View, so what I'm going to talk about next is VMWare specific.

It's 2031. Aside from ancient Mayan doomsday fears centering around 2012 turning out to be false, you're now 41 years old. You've finished college, and then followed the typical path of bouncing around a few different jobs. You finally settled on one that you enjoyed and it paid a decent salary. You moved up the ranks of this company (let's call it IBM for the story's sake) and eventually you're a big shot manager. You've got other friends, they are big shot managers. You all drive Audi A4s, BMW 3 series or Mercedes C class sedans. (they all now run on unicorn farts, which is ok for the environment) You spend hours doing important managerial type stuff like flying to distant meetings, playing golf, and attending big board room meetings with all your big shot manager friends. So, one day ya'll are sitting around the table and you're BSing about this and that, and the subject of sex comes up. You play it cool, you sit back with a sly grin while stories of long-past college glory days are recounted. Someone mentions how he lost his virginity at his high-school girlfriend's house, while her parents were home. Laughter abounds. Jeff slaps your shoulder and says how funny Mike's story was. Your coy grin is just telling enough to be noticed. Jeff looks at you during the inevitable moment of near-silent chuckles that often occur between people's stories in settings such as this. He notices your grin, your sly smile, that just MAYBE says, ""You guys have no fucking clue how fucking badass I am."" Jeff says, ""Hey, IwantAnEscort, what's your story? How did you lose it man? Mike's shit was hilarious, whatcha got?"" 

You lean back in your chair, you let the moment hang in the air... you've been waiting for this question for 2 years, the right moment, the right setting. Blow this now and you're a chump. Own it and you're a cross between the Dos Equis Most Interesting Man and fucking sean connery for all time badass. Mike's done chuckling now and all eyes are on you. You exhale, and run your hand through your hair... the anxiety is palpable, and everyone now sees that you've been holding back your cards... little do they know that this will be your 5th symphony, your Mona Lisa of locker-room rhetoric. You're about the be promoted above all these guys based solely on the legends that will grow out of this one story. 

""I wasn't like you, Mike, I didn't mess around too much in high school. Jeff, your story about the girl in the car, well, I didn't experience that until later in college. My first time wasn't until I was 21 years old."" Nervous glances abound amongst your peers, John asks if you weren't into girls, and someone remarks about how he was ""getting some"" at 15. But you aren't these asshats. You're better than them. Your sly grin stays firmly planted. Ice man. You wait until the noise subsides. You maintain eye contact. You're not a spontaneous speaker, you plan your shit... and that's exactly what you go on to explain. 

""Shut up. Do you think I'd be caught dead with those hogs you were messing around with in high school? How many guys fell by the wayside, getting bitches pregnant? Remember Murphy? He got fucking AIDS. No, not for me. I got a 4.0 in high school and graduated from Dartmouth with a 4.0 there too. I didn't have time for that bullshit. And that's why I got this job 5 years before you guys did, worked my way up the ladder twice as fast, working twice as hard, and it's why my Aston is parked between your shitty Deutsche entry-level cars. No, I plan my moves guys. Dave, write that down. 'Plan. Your. Moves.' When I was 21 I decided it was time to do this. But you guys know me, I don't do low-class, I drink from crystal glasses and I only sleep with married women. No, here's how I lost mine. It was 2011. I woke up on this rainy day in March, my mood feeling dull and somber. A room temperature glass of 20 year old whiskey failed to revive my senses. I knew it was time. I booked a first class ticket to Cadiz, Spain. Upon arrival I took a ride to an upscale bar in the restaurant district, overlooking the bay. A cute Andalusian hostess brought me a glass of the finest Sherry you've ever tasted. I asked her to send the owner to my table, as I slipped her a 20 Euro note. I'd be coming back here tomorrow and taking her home with me. But not tonight. Tonight was for me. The owner sauntered over and inquired as to the nature of my request. The moment had arrived. I asked where one could find a certain type of female accompaniment for the evening, preferably somewhere high class. The three word reply crossed his lips with a smooth Andalusian lisp. ""La Hacienda, Senior!"" I was gone in a flash, into a taxi and out into the Spanish night. The vehicle drove through Jerez, onto the road to Seville. Just on the outskirts of Jerez, tucked amongst a grove of tall trees, set amongst the rolling plains of Southern Spain, stood a single, moss-covered, brick motel. A faded sign pronounced that this was, indeed, La Hacienda. I paid the taxi driver and watched his car fade into the darkness. The cool night air sent a chill down my spine. The sound of soft music escaped the building, comforting my moment of hesitation. I went inside. The lobby was dark, and in fact it wasn't so much a lobby at all, it was a large bar. There were 20-30 people inside, all talking in low conversation broken by the occasional laugh. In truth, the bar would not look out of place back in Cadiz, with the exception that something didn't look right... something was a tad off... and then it hits me, it hits me in the form of the perfectly shaped C-cups of the bronzed beauty that steps by me... the male female ratio is a perfect 1:1, and every woman in the room is strikingly beautiful. As I creep to the bar and order another glass of Sherry, a movement catches my eye. I look to my right, and standing next to me is the most beautiful woman I've probably ever seen, outside of magazines, or TV. She's 5'-3"" tall, her skin is dark and smooth, and almost glowing, she introduces herself, and says her name is Julia; the words come across buried in the thick accent that only makes her that much more amazing. She sits on my lap, and we discuss trivial facts, such as how I'm an American, and she's from Argentina, working to make money to pay for college. My words have trouble coming off my tongue, and my palms are sweating... finally she asks me if I want to go upstairs. I do. Julia takes her hand and leads me through the crowd of people, her light perfume guiding my way as much as her touch. We climb the expansive staircase and walk down a hallway that would not look out of place in any fancy, old European hotel. Finally, we arrive at a room. We enter. The room is decorated in dark red upholstery, the architecture is simple, with some Moorish influence in the 8 pointed star on the ceiling. Julia slips off her dress as she casually mentions that her rate is 200 Euros an hour. I brush off the comment, and tell her that that's fine. I pull out a wad of crisp 100 Euro notes and slide 6 of them onto the bed. I tell her to order a bottle of Sherry and a tray of caviar. We proceed to have three hours of sex... the best sex of my life, stopped by long sessions of drinking and eating. Her body was the most amazing female form I've ever witnessed, and the way her hair curled around me... I'll never experience that again. But for three hours I enjoyed what none of you have ever felt. Her smell still lingers in my nose, and occasionally, 20 years later, walking through a crowded bar or mall I'll catch a wiff, just the slightest hint of that scent, and I'm immediately aroused. So yes, to answer the hanging question... my first time was with an Argentinian prostitute in a villa just outside one of the oldest cities in Spain. And her name was Julia, and it was better than anything you've ever dreamed about, laying in a pool of your own despair, drinking yourselves to sleep at 41 years old, reaching out for fading memories of sluts whom you can't even remember their names. Me? I had Julia, and it was the greatest night of my life.""

And then you sit back in your chair. Sometime in your story you had closed your eyes. You were back there, in Spain, in that villa on the small hill outside Jerez. Her smell fills your nose and you picture the rise and fall of those golden breasts... You open your eyes. Not a word is spoken. Of the eight men sitting in the circle, all of them have their jaws hanging open. Your boss, whom you didn't see or hear enter the room during your story looks down in silent approval. The nod he gives, just the slightest of head movements lets you know that you'll be sitting in that corner office tomorrow. You rise up, and leave the room. You're the iceman. And the iceman doesn't say a word as he walks out to his car to go home. You'll be enjoying a nice glass of sherry tonight, after dinner with the sexy secretary from the office next door, but when you've taken her home and undressed her in the darkness, you'll be imagining a day not so long ago...",0,AskReddit,False

The fact that they don't have to pay tax gives them an unfair advantage when it comes to buying assets and real estate.

You are wrong bad diet is more frugal you just don't live as long and you are confusing the two. Obesity and wealth always have gone hand in hand just look back to the nobels of Europe. Fat people were almost always rich and poor people were almost always skinny. It's just simple economics. 

You facts a bunch of crap from nutball websites. 

We've been eating chemicals since the advent of chemical fertilizer... remember DDT ? Still life expectancy has done nothing but rise. 

So.. whatever unhealthy factors we have introduces we have more than offset with modern medicine. 

Veggies are the most 'disease preventative' foods out there if such a thing is actually real. The risk of eating pesticidese and hormones is simply not in way proven to be all that great. Maybe you die 10 years sooner at most. Most studies show all your good diet and exercise equate only a few extra years of life. Even smoking doesn't knock off that many years of life. It's pretty much 90% genetics and the rest is how you life your life so you can't cheat death with diet.

Diet and  bring active give you more energy and make you look better which help you enjoy life more. Genetics almost completely determine your longevity that and modern science being able to treat your cancer and heart disease which again are genetic in most cases.

I find you a sad misinformed example of humanity and obviously your need to insult other people's opinion with childish comments show your low self esteem which makes you wish you were smarter than you actually are. 

Being fat simply only has a very very minor aspect on longevity. Being morbidly obese is different but against studies have suggested slightly overweight people love longer than their counterparts. 

Paleo diet.. like most nonbalanced diets is fun but it's mostly bullshit. Not eating refined food is smart, but that is not what paleo means. Eggs, grains, veggies, fiber in general and most fruit would be very rare to find. It's basically an all meat diet if you followed it honestly. You are underestimating how inaccurate and how little data we have from this time. You can't live on bird eggs in roots you have to hunt. The amount of game back then would have been enormous. 

You also have to understand sociology. A tribe would grow as big as it's food supply and then begin to starve and it would have to move on. The process would killed dozens more as they desperately look for another spot to hunt or gather. 

Are you really going to argue that rice is not healthy? Why do asians have such a lower health disease and obesity risk. Well one obviously reason is they FUCKING EAT LESS just like your precious cavemen and that is what health is really all about.

Imagine your body is an engine and the more fuel you run through it the sooner it wears out. Being overly athletic is not a way to live longer eating 10,000 calories a day and working it off through intense training will almost always shorten your lifespan. Its about eating less and eating a balanced diet however I do agree stay away from flour, refined sugar, salt and other preservatives. However it's not truly possible to not ingest chemicals in today society. You walk outside and breathe the air or drink the water and you've ingested chemicals. You can't have a meat diet and ignore the implications on resources in a world that is overpopulated.

Either you eat veggies grown with chemicals, you eat meat with treated with chemicals or you fuel global starvation. There is no global organic food industry of any significant production level. You want meat you gotta feed the cows grain. You want that much grain you gotta use chemical fertilizer and unless you want meat to be more expensive you need modern medicine. I'm not saying it can't be improved but there is no significant link in lower longevity and chemically grown foods.

If you know anything you know organic fertilizers are the same chemicals as standard ferts and they been used for decades upon decades upon decades. If life expectancy keeps rising then your argument is almost certainly complete bullshit and in nations with better diet life expectancy is only modestly higher at best. The only argument you have is today's diet drive up medical costs, but that is really is only true in the US were we have for profit medicine. It's a fact of capitalism not increased disease from diet.

As for European social being successful, how about Greece? Socialism is great, just give everyone everything they want. The problem of course is that production doesn't always equal expenditures.

&gt; Unconstrained competition inevitably leads to monopoly or oligopoly. 
completely wrong. Competition doesn't result in monopolies. The lack of competition is what produces monopolies, the exact opposite. In addition, it usually takes the assistance of government to reduce compeititon (e.g. drug companies).

&gt; Why invest when you can pay off a few legislators to screw your competition or force your unhappy customers to do business with you?

I completely agree with this statement. It's exactly what happens and it's why we are currently so screwed up. The part you left out here though is that there are actually two alternatives. One is to eliminate a free market, which you said. The other is to eliminate government (or the power that government wields). 

So now you're going to say ""we can't eliminate government, we need it bigger! We therefore have to eliminate the free market""

Fine go ahead, eliminate the market, but then the question has to be asked if you solved the problem inherent with powerful centralized government. The answer is no. Even without big business trying to corrupt government, there will still be individuals that seek power  for powers sake.

There's absolutely no doubt that it was *a lot* easier for me that way but in my case the actual integration was done by my father and his parents already. My grandmother still speaks perfect Czech, so does my grandfather but beyond that you couldn't tell that they were not born in Germany. My father then was already perfectly integrated and I think already he felt completely German. Add to the fact that I'm blond and blue-eyed and there was really no integration that I had to do.. it was all done for me already (hell, even my name is German-sounding but that was because the Nazis forced my grandparents to change theirs.. different story)

But to come back to your question: Yes, looks absolutely play a major role, because, as I said in my other comment here, the whole world really has an image of Germany (and many other European countries) that is long outdated.

Show a picture of a German-Turk to a number of people (be it Americans, French, Turks etc.) and very few people will answer the question for her nationality with ""maybe German"". I wouldn't even call it racism or bigotry; more misinformation and influence of the media and society.

I also don't think that this is something where Germany has exceptional problems. You see basically the same mechanics in France with Blacks, in England with Pakistanis, in Holland with Arabs, hell you see some of them ""even"" with Germans in Switzerland and, while different in many aspects, think about Kurds in Turkey.

I say that how in the US Blacks, Asians, Hispanics consider themselves first and foremost American (and only after that as part of their minority group) is the exception because of the unique case that everybody can trace their ancestry back to an immigrant (sorry Native Americans).

Die Hard isn't terribly realistic either - that doesn't mean it isn't an excellent action film.

Highly recommended to fans of great action.  For people looking for a deeply introspective flick dealing with issues of morality and containing a highly realistic look at how kidnapping affects a family, you should try a different genre.

In the colony of Virginia, tobacco revenues were used to pay the salaries of Anglican clerics. It was this practice that led to a famous speech by Patrick Henry in a court case known as the [Parson's Cause](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parson%27s_cause) that helped him rise to prominence. He made the following statement about the Anglican clerics during the trial:

&gt;Do they feed the hungry and clothe the naked? Oh, no, gentlemen! These rapacious harpies would, were their power equal to their will, snatch from the hearth of their honest parishioner his last hoe-cake, from the widow and her orphan children her last mich cow! the last bed-nay, the last blanket-from the lying-in woman!""

Source: [The Parsons' Cause Trial: 1763 - The Suit](http://law.jrank.org/pages/2354/Parsons-Cause-Trial-1763-Suit.html)

Virginia was not the only colony to use government revenues to pay the clerics of the dominant religous group in the colony. The Puritans, also known as ""Congregationalists"", were the dominant religious group in New England and did the same there.

&gt;Although they had come to America seeking religious freedom for themselves, the Congregationalist were not keen on granting it to others. They accorded ""established"" status to their own churches, and did not hesitate to use the power of civil government to achieve their religious ends. Only Congregationalists in good standing were permitted to vote in civil elections in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Everyone was taxed for support of the Church, and those who failed to attend a worship service were subject to punishment by the civil government. Sabbath observance was enforced by civil statute — the first ""[blue laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_laws).""

Source: [What’s the Difference? A Comparison of the Faiths Men Live By by Louis Cassels](http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=1623&amp;)

In Virginia and Massachusetts, members of other Christian denominations were opressed by the dominant Christian denomination in the colony. The Puritans persecuted and jailed Quakers and others. E.g., see [Persecution of Quakers in Colonial New England](http://www.worldspirituality.org/persecution-quakers.html) regarding their treatment of Quakers.

The Puritans also jailed and even whipped Baptists. E.g., see [Baptists, Puritans, and the Witch Hunt!](http://www.canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/3833).

And from [A History of the Baptists, CHAPTER III, The Persecutions of the Baptists in Massachusetts](http://www.pbministries.org/History/John%20T.%20Christian/vol2/history2_part1_03.htm):

&gt;Thomas Painter, of Hingham, who had lived in several other places, had become a Baptist. He would not suffer his wife, a member of the church, to have his child baptized. He was presented, and required to cease from such opposition. But ""still refusing and disturbing the church,"" and asserting that the baptism of the colony was anti-christian, and affirming the same before the court, they sentenced him to be whipped, because not able to pay a fine. 

Baptists were also persecuted by the Anglicans in Virginia. E.g., see [The Virginia Baptists](http://www.hslda.org/docs/hshb/75/hshb7531.asp).

&gt;By the 1760s, the Baptists of Virginia had become the colony’s most-persecuted sect.
&gt;
&gt;In 1772, the Virginia Gazette opined that the Baptists imprisoned in Caroline County were perfectly free to hold their private opinions, but when it came to preaching publicly, the legislature was likewise perfectly within its rights to establish religion and set bounds for its toleration.
&gt;
&gt;In the eyes of authorities, it was the epitome of stubborn ingratitude for unlicensed Baptists to preach. Yet in the eyes of many Baptists, to merely apply for a license was to acknowledge the legitimacy of the government’s control over religion, which they decried as a surrender of God’s sole prerogative to Caesar.

Earlier in Virginia in 1611, ""The Code of Sir Thomas Dale"" permitted those who didn't adhere to the religous standards of the Anglicans to be whipped.

&gt;There is not one man nor woman in this colony, now present nor hereafter to arrive, but shall give an account of his or their faith and religion, and repair unto the minister, that by his conference with them, he may understand and gather whether they have been sufficiently instructed and catechised in the principles and grounds of religion; whose weakness and ignorance, the minister finding, and advising them in love and charity to repair often to him, to receive therein a greater measure of knowledge, if they shall refuse to repair unto him, and he, the minister, give notice thereof to the governor, or the chief officers of that town or fort, wherein he or she, the parties so offending shall remain, the governor shall cause the offender for the first time of refusal, to be whipped; for the second time, to be whipped twice, and to acknowledge his fault upon the Sabbath day in the congregation; and for the third time, to be whipped every day, until he hath made the same acknowledgment, and asked forgiveness for the same, and shall repair unto the minister to be further instructed as aforesaid; and upon the Sabbath when the minister shall catechise, and demand any question concerning his faith and knowledge, he shall not refuse to make answer, upon the same peril (Laws, &amp;c. Strachey. London, 1612. Howison, History of Virginia, II. 148).

So many of America's founding fathers would likely have been well aware of the consequences of allowing the government to favor one religous group over others. 

Those who, today, would like to remove the barriers between church and state in the U.S. assume that their religion will be the one then favored by the state. But, if they looked at the history of the colonies that preceded the United States, perhaps they, too, could get an inkling of where that might lead.",0,atheism,False

You are currently selling them for two dollars.  You find out that candy bars next week will cost you five dollars.  Do you keep selling those candy bars for two dollars?  

No.  You increase your price.  This is reasonable because you don't know what is going to happen to the candy bar supply--are they going to run out?--or to the candy bar demand--are people going to stop buying expensive candy bars?  That instability/uncertainty will always drive the price up, rather than down.  Also, as a capitalist, you are ALWAYS selling things as expensively as you can--that's how capitalism works.  You can't just jack up your price, or people will go buy their candy bars somewhere else--but if everyone has a reason to increase prices, you can bet your ass they will do so, whether they are motivated by fear or greed or rational business decisions.

The problem is much more systemic than a few greedy capitalists.  Within the capitalist system, greed is normal--even praised--and it is reasonable for everyone from the oil drillers to the gas station owner to economically rape you for every cent that they can.  You have no choice, because you drive a car to work, and not driving that car is not an option.  American cities are built around cars--we spent government money on roads, not on buses or trains.  If you don't like having to pay $4/gallon for gas, don't get mad at the guy pumping it--get mad at politicians for the last 4 decades, who've construction an America where it's almost impossible not to own a car.  Europe has much better public transporation--something which took alot of government effort to create--because they wanted to avoid that dependence on one single type of transportation.

I'm with you...I'm for capitalism to an extent, because it does drive competition, but I don't think private companies should make easy money selling natural resources that belong to everyone.

If the warlords won't let aid workers in and if they say they will only accept food if it goes through them (and promptly keep 90% for themselves) then all the good intentions and efforts are for nothing.  That doesn't seem like such a trivial problem and at some point I think you have to ask yourself is the effort worth it.  And are we possibly making problems worse.

IE:  If we give food aid and warlords keep it for themselves and dole out just enough to keep the population from uprising or revolution have we really helped anybody.  The warlords stay strong and stay in power and the people don't take those in power out of power (though whether they even be able to if they wanted is another part of the problem).  If as a result of staying in power warlords continue to murder or commit genocide then have we actually killed more people as a result of giving aid than if we had just done nothing.

Obviously this only applies to certain countries.  Giving food aid to homeless or starving people throughout spain or europe or the US and so on would not have the same result as giving out food aid in somalia or rwanda and i'm rather ignorant on the condition of every african country

In the past the U.S has generally been pretty conservative compared to the rest of the world and for the most part weve been pretty successful, even now there are only a few countries that top our GDP per capita and there are some extenuating circumstance for that. We can also look at eastern European countries that have recently been freed from soviet oppression only about 20 years ago. Theve tended to have pretty high GDP growth rate close to 10% and they are pretty conservative I believe most of those countries have a flat tax and no socialized medicine. 

By comparison if you go against conservative ideals you should look at alot of places where going to far against them has been pretty disastrous, greece come to mind. Most of the EU has a pretty flat growth rate too close to 1-2% historically and they have typically had about 2x the unemployment rate the US has had. 

Its really not that simple though to say x works everyone do x, its also pretty difficult to determine what is successful in the long term.

A growing gap between rich and poor is irrelevant in my opinion. You can't stop it. 

Even if you institute massive wealth redistribution, there will be people outside your country who are much wealthier than your citizens, and so the gap will continue to grow on the global scale, and unless you want to become an isolationist nation and prohibits its people from interacting with and being influenced by those outside the country, then whatever problems that would be caused by wealth disparity within the nation are going to be caused by wealth disparity between your citizens and the rich outside the nation.

&gt;(1) You could live in a well educated, technologically advanced, egalitarian, cooperative and safe society where social services provide a minimal living standard to everyone and allows innovators to rise and become wealthy.

You could live in a society where instead of paying taxes to pay for a strangers education, health care, and welfare checks, you loan them the money, they use it for their health care, education, etc, and then when they get back on their feet, they pay you back the loan plus interest.


&gt;The majority of people have little luxury, education or healthcare. The rich might be moderately richer in this scenario, but they must put up with a dirty, unhealthy, and basically crappy society.
IMHO, while the rich benefit marginally from (2), everyone including the rich man benefits in situation (1). Furthermore, it is the (2) society that is going to be more competitive in the long term, with a strong infrastructure, and educated workforce that can support the innovation necessary to compete in the modern world.

That's not how free-market oriented societies look.

They spend a fraction of what European nations do per capita on social welfare programs, and their economies are far less regulated than western nations.

Your budget is probably going to put you into the ""backpacker"" accommodation level wherever you go.  Europe is pretty expensive, particularly the major cities, but you can find sites advising on shoestring-travel.  With Paris you can certainly walk everywhere on food and use the metro quite cheaply.  Likewise Amsterdam - it's easy to walk around.

Consider the weather obviously - it's summer here in Sydney now, winter in Europe.  For a quick Sydney itinerary I would suggest:

Accommodation:  find a backpacker hostel somewhere in the city.

Day 1:  take a ferry from Circular Quay (the city wharf) to Manly (NOT Bondi - Bondi is ugly, and you have to get buses and stuff to get there) - it's just a regular city ferry, so only a few bucks, and the journey is a panoramic cruise around the harbour, so wonderful for photos.  Heaps of cheap food options at Manly, and the beach is great.  Either stay the whole day, or come back to Circular Quay, and go and walk around The Rocks in the afternoon. 

Day 2:  if your budget allows and you like wildlife, take another ferry to Taronga Zoo (there's a combined zoo/ferry pass) and have a look round there.  It's set in a beautiful location on the headland on the north shore of the harbour, looking back towards the city, and you will get a real feel for Australian flora and fauna there.

Day 3:  Darling Harbour.  Find your way here - maybe take the monorail from the city (where you can shop in Pitt St mall if you like) and just wander around and see the sights.  You could also wander down to Chinatown at the south end of Darling Harbour.",0,AskReddit,False

It's all a popularity contest, folks. In 100 years in the future, Van Gogh might fall out of style, and his paintings might be worth $500,000, instead of the $80M, or whatever they now command.

This is so wrong. Not wrong as in 'morally objectionable', but wrong as in 'totally incorrect'. The simple fact that the EU is imploding with their population shrinking and economic stability should lead people to examine the policies that brought them to where they are today. If you haven't looked at the population growth rates have a look at the CIA World Fackbook. Their death rate is actually higher than their birth rate. For those who are bad at math this means that tomorrow they will have fewer people than they had yesterday. 

With an aging population the retirees have fewer and fewer people to tax in order to provide benefits. There is actually negative growth in the economy because there are fewer consumers today than there was yesterday. This means fewer homes, clothes, automobiles, etc. The US is a bit better off, but not by much. We are growing with a higher birth rate and immigration. However, this will only delay the inevitable if we don't change course.

Further, many countries in Africa have been ravaged by AIDS - some countries have infection rates of 50% or more. This isn't exactly a recipe for overpopulation.

China is seen variously as an ancient civilization extending over a large area in East Asia, a nation and/or a multinational entity. With nearly 4,000 years of continuous history, China is one of the world's oldest civilizations. Prior to the 19th century, it possessed one of the most advanced societies and economies in the world; but through successive dynasties it then missed the Industrial Revolution and began to decline. In the 19th and 20th century, imperialism, internal weakness and civil wars damaged the country and its economy, and led to the overthrow of imperial rule. In 1949, after major combat ended in the Chinese Civil War, two states calling themselves ""China"" emerged: The People's Republic of China (PRC), established in 1949, commonly known as China, has control over mainland China and the largely self-governing territories of Hong Kong (since 1997) and Macau (since 1999). The Republic of China (ROC) established in 1912 in mainland China, now commonly known as Taiwan, has control over the islands of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu, the Pratas island group, and a few other outlying islands. In the 1950s, change to economic policies in Taiwan transformed the island into a technology-oriented industrialized developed economy after a period of high growth rates and rapid industrialization. In mainland China, in the 1970s, reforms known as the Four Modernizations improved agriculture, industry, technology and defense, raising living standards and making the PRC one of the great powers. Historically, cultural sphere of China has extended across East Asia as a whole, with Chinese religion, customs, and writing systems being adopted to varying degrees by neighbors such as Japan, Korea and Vietnam. Through its history, China was the source of many major inventions.[9] It has also one of the world's oldest written language systems. The first evidence of human presence in the region was found at the Zhoukoudian cave. It is one of the earliest known specimens of Homo erectus, now commonly known as the Peking Man, estimated to have lived from 300,000 to 780,000 years ago. The word ""China"" is derived from Cin (چین), a Persian name for China popularized in Europe by Marco Polo.[13][14] The first recorded use in English dates from 1555, with ""Cathay"" being the earlier English term for China.[15] In early usage, ""china"" as a term for porcelain was spelled differently from the name of the country, the two words being derived from separate Persian words.[16] Both these words are derived from the Sanskrit word Cīna (चीन),[16] used as a name for China as early as AD 150. There are various scholarly theories regarding the origin of this word. The traditional theory, proposed in the 17th century by Martino Martini, is that ""China"" is derived from ""Qin"" (秦, pronounced chin), the westernmost of the Chinese kingdoms during the Zhou Dynasty, or from the succeeding Qin Dynasty (221 – 206 BC).[18] In the Hindu scriptures Mahābhārata (5th century BC)[19] and Manusmṛti (Laws of Manu) (2nd century BC), the Sanskrit word Cīna (चीन) is used to refer to a country located in the Tibeto-Burman borderlands east of India.[20] Another theory is that this word is derived from Yelang, an ancient kingdom in what is now Guizhou whose inhabitants referred to themselves as 'Zina'. The official name of China changed with each dynasty or with each new government, the imperial governments referred to themselves as the Empire of the Great Qing, Empire of the Great Ming, etc. However, the common name remained as Zhōngguó (simplified Chinese: 中国; traditional Chinese: 中國, Mandarin pronunciation: [tʂʊ́ŋkwɔ̌]) through dynastic changes. This translates traditionally as ""Middle Kingdom,"" or as ""central country.""
The name Zhōngguó first appeared in the Classic of History (6th century BC), and was used to refer to the late Zhou Dynasty, as they believed that they were the ""center of civilization,""[nb 1] while peoples in the four cardinals were called Eastern Yi, Southern Man, Western Rong and Northern Di respectively. Some texts imply that ""Zhōngguó"" was originally meant to refer to the capital of the sovereign, to differ from the capital of his vassals.[nb 2] The use of ""Zhōngguó"" implied a claim of political legitimacy, and ""Zhōngguó"" was often used by states who saw themselves as the sole legitimate successor to previous Chinese dynasties; for example, in the era of the Southern Song Dynasty, both the Jin Dynasty and the Southern Song state claimed to be ""Zhōngguó."" Zhōngguó was used as a common name for the Republic of China (Zhonghua Minguo) after its establishment in 1912. After the Communists took over control of China in 1949, they established the People's Republic of China (PRC). As a result, the PRC is now commonly known as ""China"" or ""Zhōngguó"". The Republic of China nowadays is commonly known as ""Taiwan"".",0,politics,False

Strongly disagree here.  I don't think the Great Depression was good for us.

You'll dismiss my historical examples and claim other factors were the cause, and I'll do the same to yours.

&gt;Well lets ignore the gamed CPI for a minute and look at the real world and the cost of things. Perhaps you can point out to me where you are seeing deflation because I'm missing it.

I'm not saying that deflation is actually occurring, but going back a year and a half you heard warnings of deflation from various economists at the same time you heard about the impending hyper-inflation from others.  The Fed has balanced it pretty well up to this point.

&gt;That's happening now, but it's the economic interventionists that aren't admitting they were wrong. The fed is just a tool, the problem is an economic philosophy of intervention.

Oh I don't think so.  Placing the blame for this bubble at the feet of Fannie and Freddie doesn't really work, as the entire thing can be explained easily without them.

All it took was a massive leap in the holdings in the worlds' central banks in the 90's, plus greenspan's extremely low interest rates, plus rating agencies that were using 50 year old default rate data intentionally because of conflicts of interest... and that's pretty much it.  From there it's a pretty clear avalanche of retarded investing every step of the way down to the consumer.

It wasn't a bubble of prime, fixed-rate mortgages that got us into the mess.

As far as Schiff goes... if you doom and gloom about everything, you're going to be right about something eventually.  If you think he's spot on about everything... I *dare* you to invest a large chunk of your money with him.  Ask his clients how that's gone for them.... decoupling? hyperinflation?  What happened to those?  I'm pretty sure nobody that says Schiff is a genius actually invests with him.

&gt;Well wish in one hand and shit in the other and see which one fills up first. It would be great if you could just waive your hand and make the dilemma go away, but uninsurable is uninsurable for a reason. Dictating that it ceases to happen just makes the insurance companies push that cost onto everyone else it does not make the costs disappear.

Which is washed out by the increased pool the mandate brings in.  According to CBO's numbers, the cost for the same amount of coverage will actually be less in the individual and small group markets in comparison with what it would have been under previous policy (the large group market stays pretty much unaffected)

&gt;This is one of those provisions that is unworkable without the mandate.

All of Title I is unworkable without the mandate (which means pretty much the entire bill as far as what the public knows... nothing outside of Title I ever got any media attention).  Luckily, the bill includes the mandate.

&gt;To me, the missed opportunity would have been to create a nonprofit health care option (even if that was just expanding medicare and I say this as a libertarian) that allowed anyone to buy in at the cost of insuring them. That relatively simple fix would have created a lowest cost option for people and resulted in the other insurance companies having to compete on cost or some other factor in much the same way as fedex/UPS and the USPS. No mandate, no regulation, just make them compete against an organization where providing baseline care while keeping costs to a minimum was priority one.

That's exactly how the public option was structured before it was removed... but I actually don't think it was *that* important.  Non-profit insurers already exist in a number of markets, and once each state is set up with its own exchange, I would bet that non-profit insurers will be an option for almost everybody.  You get the same effect though from increased competition between private insurers, and the exchange system will eliminate the situations where you only have one or two insurers basically monopolizing an entire region.

Our cost problem is pretty much entirely Medicare's fault for the way its provider reimbursement methods drive and distort the market (and I say that as a liberal).

Our coverage problem is solved by this bill.  No more people who are underinsured and between the subsidies to go purchase insurance and the Medicaid expansion, there will literally be no citizens of this country that won't be able to get healthcare.

If you have any martial arts training you can see he is reactive not proactive. If in the eyes of the law that constitutes physical resistance then so be it. I know in practical terms it basically means what you say - after all its the word of the arresting officers against the suspect. 

I can understand how a cop would write him down as being resistant. But IMO, standing your ground against an unreasonable request is justified. The cops then have the option to escalate the situation or address the request. 

IME, they usually go for the former, it's an easy victory. I'm not a cop hater, I have family members who are cops. But they know full well how to turn any situation to their advantage - be it physically, technically, or legally. And they do it every day, they all know what to do and how to write the reports. Maybe they want to be jerks, maybe they had a bad day and are short tempered, or maybe they just cant be bothered. They're not robots, they're as fallible as you or I.

We didn't see *why* the police were talking to him, so it's hard to judge if they overstepped their boundaries. My conclusion is they did, but I'm happy to have that changed.

My suspicion is that as this happened in the market square in Helsinki - and that this guy was an Estonian with bad Finnish - and selling out of a van - that this guy was being a bit opportunistic. 

He might have got the ferry over for the day and was selling without a permit, or he might not have paid duties, or taxes. If he got the 'shrooms from Estonia - he likely got them for a fraction of the price his Finnish competitors got them for. So I wouldn't be surprised if he rocked up in his van and pissed off some of the established market traders.

Then there is the Estonian angle, you can see how he felt this was a factor. Estonia are quite recent members of the EU. In blunt terms they are the poor relations. They don't get as much respect as they deserve. These new countries are legally equals, and they want to be treated as such - not just as a source of cheap labour. They were promised all kinds of things and the reality hasnt quite delivered anything more than a huge recession. So they're a bit pissed about that, we promised them free trade and free access - no passports or duties etc. But there are still hoops to be jumped, the cards aren't stacked absolutely fairly.

And it is 100% true that I as an Irishman can (in limited situations) demand and receive an Irish (or English) speaking translator in Finland, Estonia, France, Poland, Portugal, anywhere in the EU. Obv this holds true for all official languages (23 of these lol) within the EU.

I can totally understand why this guy lost his cool. It's always a losing tactic, but sometimes you have lost before you've begun.",0,WTF,False

&gt;He wrote the Comedy in a language he called ""Italian"", in some sense an amalgamated literary language mostly based on the regional dialect of Tuscany, with some elements of Latin and of the other regional dialects. The aim was to deliberately reach a readership throughout Italy, both laymen, clergymen and other poets. By creating a poem of epic structure and philosophic purpose, he established that the Italian language was suitable for the highest sort of expression. In French, Italian is sometimes nicknamed la langue de Dante. Publishing in the vernacular language marked Dante as one of the first (among others such as Geoffrey Chaucer and Giovanni Boccaccio) to break free from standards of publishing in only Latin (the language of liturgy, history, and scholarship in general, but often also of lyric poetry). This break set a precedent and allowed more literature to be published for a wider audience—setting the stage for greater levels of literacy in the future. However, unlike Boccaccio, Milton or Ariosto, Dante didn't really become an author read all over Europe until the romantic era. To the romantics, Dante, like Homer and Shakespeare, was a prime example of the ""original genius"" who sets his own rules, creates persons of overpowering stature and depth and goes far beyond any imitation of the patterns of earlier masters and who, in turn, cannot really be imitated. Throughout the 19th century, Dante's reputation grew and solidified, and by the time of the 1865 jubilee, he had become solidly established as one of the greatest literary icons of the Western world.

Salient quote from the page on the [Divine Comedy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Comedy):

&gt; Dante was one of the first in the Middle Ages to write of a serious subject, the Redemption of Man, in the low and vulgar Italian language and not the Latin language as one might expect for such a serious topic. Boccaccio's account that an early version of the poem was begun by Dante in Latin is still controversial.

So, Americans for the most part may “take home more pay”, but they also have to pay a lot more for items that others pay far less for (with little exception such as some media items).   Things like rent, food, clothing and so on.

In other words, you have to compare income with expense in a local place to see ‘wealth’ or ‘poverty’.  Now, throw in that so much wealth is held by the top 1% in the U.S.A., but that wealth is still represented in the system, you have prices that are higher than they would be otherwise, but with a general population that does not actually hold the vast majority of wealth that American as a whole represents that have to still buy those goods.

A half Gallon of milk in the US is $2.30.  In India it’s $0.70.  Coffee is around $9 a lb in the US, in Kuwait it’s $0.27.  Bread is around 2 bucks in the US, in India it’s $0.28.  Gas is only $0.12 a gallon in Venezuela, it’s 3 bucks in the US, and over 6 in some European counties.  Lots of variance out there, but you get the point.

When I was a kid, our population was comprised of almost entirely european and maori. Asian ethnic groups were scarce. Racism towards them was quite clear. By the time I was about 15, the numbers of asian immigrants started increasing rapidly, and so did the racism. Then lots of asian kids started being born and growing up there. They looked like any other chinese/indian/japanese kid, but they opened their mouth to speak and they were 100% kiwi. They grew up with ""normal"" kiwi kids as their friends. They have now just finished university, and are starting to establish their positions in adult society. Amongst that age group, the racism of the old days is dramatically diminished. 

I believe that given time here in Korea, you will start to see the same thing happening - The students here have a pretty positive relationship with their western teachers, and are growing up with personal experiences that contradict the stories they hear from some of their elders.

Gun rights. Conservatives argue for gun rights because they claim it will help protect against a fascist takeover / foreign invasion.  They also argue it helps individuals defend themselves.  The first statement is arguable, it may slow a fascist takeover / foreign invasion but a rag tag militia with American firearms would get absolutely slaughtered by a modern army using scorched earth tactics.  The second is also true.  

Now lets look at US vs. Europe where guns are much more strictly controlled.

""In the US, there are roughly 17,000 murders a year, of which about 15,000 are committed with firearms. By contrast, Britain, Australia and Canada combined see fewer than 350 gun-related murders each year. And it's not just about murder. The non-gun-related suicide rate in the US is consistent with the rest of the developed world. Factor in firearms, and the rate is suddenly twice as high as the rest of the developed world.""  - random google search

Basically the reality is Americans are willing to let their neighbors die and be murdered at much greater rates then in nations with gun control in order to have cool toys and for the small chance they may get defend from a crime one day.

Positive rights are a social construct,  they exist because they exist,  they exist because they need to exist.   What you fail to understand in your obviously shallow, selfish,  and short sighted view is that these positive rights keep you from getting your ass kicked.    You have wealth those others don't.    They have food on their table,  since the government provides this social assistance.    The problem is if this system fell out of favor,  if their tables went bare,  it would not be long before you saw the very same degradation in social order as is being seen across the middle east and some parts of europe.    Granted much of that is due to the lack of freedoms afforded by dictatorships and such,   but the lack of freedom and the lack of food share a similar bed,  both reduce the ability to live ones life without hardship.   Look at the number of people who rely on foodstamps.  Over 40 million.   Take that food off their tables,   see what happens to your beloved country.   Social programs,  aside from being the compassionate thing to do,  also are very relevant to social order. 

Another example is the public school system.   If we took this out of the picture (it is a social program,  so you don't like this,  or is there some arbitrary line you've drawn?),  watch what would happen to our society,  our country.   Most people go to public school,  this would mean that most people from subsequent generations will not be educated,  the country would fall to pieces.   

I can explain how or why pretty much every social program in the US somehow is good for society as a whole that includes yourself.   If you'd think a little bit beyond your wallet you'd see what it really is all about.  Even if for purely selfish reasons,   just to make what I have to deal with day to day easier by easing the lives of those in my society,  I'd do it,  because the return is net positive.   A healthier america,  as per social medicine,  ultimately reduces medical costs,  since it would have an increase in preventative care reducing the more expensive late-stage care of various diseases.   TB is caught early,  for example,  is much cheaper to treat (by an order of magnitude)  than mid-stage TB.   Problematically a lot of people don't regularly get tested and often end up with it at a later stage requiring expensive treatment;   most of these people are poor.   You do realize that you pay for this anyhow right?   I mean the hospitals are subsidized for their unpaid medical bills by the government,   so whether you have it on paper as a social-medical program or not,  you've been paying this for years.   Now if they could go get treatment early on,  you'd save millions of dollars each year,  for something you'd complain about will be more expensive.

Look at the number of people who rely on foodstamps. Over 40 million. Take that food off their tables, see what happens to your beloved country. Social programs, aside from being the compassionate thing to do, also are very relevant to social order.

The money doesn't come from nowhere. It comes from people like me. Fuck, maybe *I* want to revolt because my property rights are being violated. Also, if your reasoning was true, why wasn't the country in a constant state of violent revolutionary flux before the advent of the modern welfare state?

&gt;Another example is the public school system. If we took this out of the picture (it is a social program, so you don't like this, or is there some arbitrary line you've drawn?), watch what would happen to our society, our country. Most people go to public school, this would mean that most people from subsequent generations will not be educated, the country would fall to pieces.

Well, I do think we could do with privatized education...

But current political realities would never allow that.

&gt;I can explain how or why pretty much every social program in the US somehow is good for society as a whole that includes yourself.  

And I could probably provide a counter-argument for why it isn't. I don't see how this would be anything but a back and forth.

&gt;If you'd think a little bit beyond your wallet you'd see what it really is all about.

...What is it all about?

&gt;Even if for purely selfish reasons, just to make what I have to deal with day to day easier by easing the lives of those in my society, I'd do it, because the return is net positive. A healthier america, as per social medicine, ultimately reduces medical costs, since it would have an increase in preventative care reducing the more expensive late-stage care of various diseases. 

No, that would be a textbook definition of something that's not a net positive. It's a positive for only those suffering from expensive late-stage care. Aren't those people better off dying anyway? Is it *really* better to help one person live from 80 to 81 than it is to help 10 people live past 18?

&gt;TB is caught early, for example, is much cheaper to treat (by an order of magnitude) than mid-stage TB. Problematically a lot of people don't regularly get tested and often end up with it at a later stage requiring expensive treatment; most of these people are poor. You do realize that you pay for this anyhow right? I mean the hospitals are subsidized for their unpaid medical bills by the government, so whether you have it on paper as a social-medical program or not, you've been paying this for years. Now if they could go get treatment early on, you'd save millions of dollars each year, for something you'd complain about will be more expensive.

I don't think I should be paying these costs anyway. Maybe these people could actually afford medicine if the Congressional corporate whores allowed true competition between insurers and allowed costs to be lowered.

&gt;I guess ultimately you're just one of those guys who reads the cover of a book and assumes its contents, never actually looking into the meat of what is going on.

I don't toss off anything.  I'm not pretending to make a scientific judgement because I completely lack the expertise to do so.  But I'm willing to take the majority of experts' opinion at face value. And I'm confident that if they're wrong, the relevant evidence will be revealed and they'll be the first ones to tell us that the theory must be flawed.  There is no shortage of researchers and institutions trying to find evidence that disproves the theory, and ultimately the truth will out.

But the experts tell me, that currently no such evidence exists.  Currently the body of evidence that supports the theory vastly, *vastly* outweighs all the evidence that casts some doubt, hence their assessment that AGW is 90% likely to be correct.  That still leaves a *self-admitted* 10% chance that they're wrong, but banking on that to be the true outcome seems one hell of a gamble.

&gt; I am far more concerned about the political control you're advocating 

Now firstly I haven't advocated a damn thing other than the scientific assessment.  And secondly that's an entirely separate argument.  Don't conflate the assessment of the scientists as to the physical circumstance, with what particular politicians may or may not be saying we should do about it.  They're completely separate issues, and you can't argue against one by questioning the other.

I don't accept that there is some global conspiracy.  I don't accept that the world scientific community is somehow beholden to *any* coherent organising force, let alone that they could possibly maintain a united front in some ridiculous hoax scheme to create one world economy or whatever the fuck.  

I believe the scientists are genuine, competent, and literally devoting their entire lives to provide us with the best possible understanding. So when they tell me there's a problem, I'm open to the concept of believing them.

&gt; As time goes on the unproven science of AGW is constantly losing ground to scientists with opposing data.

I don't think that is actually the case, and if anything the meta-analyses I'm aware of indicate the weight is shifting ever more towards near-certainty.  People are still raising concerns and objections of course, but nothing has arisen that seriously challenges the AGW theory as the *most* plausible explanation.

&gt;connection about AGW and how politics and the monied interests benefit the most from regulation?

That's a valid concern to raise, but only as part of a discussion about the best way to deal with the perceived problem.  There are many possible policy responses, but you have to accept there's a problem before arguing what to do about it.  

I'm certain there are no end of organisations looking to take advantage of AGW and make shitloads of money from it.  But, there's a truckload of competing interests and lobby groups across the planet with different interests, and just as many ideas about how to proceed.  

But I don't accept that the AGW theory itself is fraudulent, nor that we should discount expert opinion just because someone somewhere might make money from it.  Accept the science first, and then lets talk about what we might do about it.

Globally, 2010 was either the equal or the 2nd hottest year on record with 1998 (which was a monster), and that's *despite* a particularly cold winter in much of the US and Europe,.  This decade was the hottest since the last decade, Artic sea-ice was the lowest on record, and the CO2 levels are stupendously higher than they've ever been in the [last six hundred thousand years](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYLGBIiq6Wg).

Now, those facts may be completely unrelated, but that's not what the experts are telling me.  And honestly, why the hell shouldn't we believe them?

But in real life, Europa League means nothing, absolutely nothing at all. For example, if Liverpool are crowned winners of Europa League this year, they stand to collect £8.5mil in total. Which would of course, seem to be a tidy sum.

But that is only for the winners. So now Birmingham, in preparation for the competition, goes out and spend on 3 players. Presumably each on £2mil? That means they only have  £2.5mil left in their non-existing reward. And perhaps each demands £20k per week to play, that will all but eliminate the monetary gains from *winning* the Europa League.

So, what happens if Birmingham unluckily stumbled out of the first round? They are now suddenly facing £6mil in transfer deficit, and facing a lost of £3mil extra per year for the 3 new players they sign, probably on a 2-3 years contract. And what more, what if the players have a hard time gelling or keeping up with the extra Europa League games? They now face relegation, and would probably be forced to buy more players to cope with it, and faces more spiraling debt concerns. This is yet to take into account things like flight bills, hotel bills, security, extra insurance, etc and the fatigue they face travelling all around Europe to face Turkish or Russian teams.

Information focus on the importance of choosing the right firm and understanding the intricacies of this financing alternative and what pitfalls to avoid.

In this challenging economy you are looking into new territories, markets and industry channels, some of those may be based outside the US. Unlike most purchase order financing companies, we work with businesses seeking growth in foreign markets such as Canada, Mexico, UK and Asia. Whether you are looking for PO financing in Canada, purchase order financing in Mexico or PO funding throughout the EU, our international PO financing program is designed to assist your business to grow and expand in the global marketplace.

What is purchase order financing?

Every business faces the challenge of managing cash flow. One tool to make it easier is purchase order financing. It gives you access to working capital in a manner that is quick, convenient and affordable. Companies use purchase order funding to support an expansion, handle a large order or surge in business, and even occasionally for operating expenses. The tool is particularly well suited to newer companies that cannot get authorized for a traditional business loan. Manufacturers, distributors, importers and exporters are good examples. Lets say your suppliers want you to pay cash on delivery, but your customer won’t pay you until 60 days after they receive your finish product – a classic cash flow problem, which purchase order financing is designed to solve. Here are some other applications:

Inexperience in generating financing

Lack of working capital

Need to keep suppliers and customers separate

Desire to avoid credit risk (PO financing is not considered debt)

Immediate sales need calls for fast response

Profit opportunity

How does purchase order financing work

Purchase order financing involves issuing letters of credit to suppliers of finished or non-finished goods, based on specific, tangible goods that have been presold to a creditworthy end customer. It can help you deliver on time, increase market share, and grow without selling equity or incurring bank debt. You will need to supply financial information about your company, customer and supplier. We take care of the rest, usually offering approval and getting your short-term funding to you in as little as two weeks. You can use this cash flow management tool to meet future growth opportunities, too -once your account is set up, the process is faster still.

It's absolutely true that white people have made major contributions to world as we know it. Anyone who denies this is just having a knee jerk reaction.

To say that a culture is not influenced by the other cultures around it is ridiculous. Christianity is a major influence in European culture, inspiring great works of art. But Christianity is a middle eastern religion. It was only through a forced merging of culture that it became a part of Europe.

You can't highlight the architecture of Greece and Rome without crediting the Egyptian architects that paved the way for them. 

And I also have major issues with ranking. Every group has done amazing things, and to try to rank demeans everyone. Why should we waste time arguing whether the Sistine chapel is better or if it's the Taj Mahal? Aren't both beautiful works of art, equally worthy of praise?

Throwing away (literally, my positioning was THAT bad) all of my army at 200/200 pushing terran (4-5 base me vs 2 base turtle) was the first one. And second one due to 4gate toss who mass zealot'd me when I wanted to defend only with lings. Yeah good luck with that, retard!

When I lose I feel more like *I* am losing - not my opponent winning. It is very assuring, because I know when I eliminate weak sides of my play I can get a lot of more wins.

Defended some 2rax all-ins, which is very nice, because I feel now really confident at tvz. Won some long ass macro pvz and this is even better, because my pvz was always lacking.

Try living within your fucking means, both on a personal level, local government level, regional government level, all the way to the top.

Why does every country on the planet have to borrow money every year ? And who are they borrowing from ? USA borrows from Europe, Europe borrows from Asia, Asia borrows from US. Have a big tally up, cancel all this ""circular"" debt, have some debt-cancellation for poorer nations like Haiti and other similar fucked up places, and then finished.

No more borrowing. You live within your means, and if you can't afford that new Flatscreen TV, or that new car, or house, or bridge, or superhighway, then you can't fucking have it ""on tick"".

It's the whole debt culture that has persisted since World War II. If you can't afford to fight a war, then don't. How simple is that. The irony is, 60 years later, the most fiscally successful country and kingpin of the European Union is ... Germany !

Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if they HAD won ? Would we all be as prosperous as they are now ? I know I'll get voted to hell for this, but it's a serious question. What is it with their culture that extols excellence and hard work and frugality ... while the rest of us are just like ""fuck it, more debt, gonna take me 100 years to pay this lot back, c'est la vie"".

Maybe the isolation from the rest of the world made them more self-reliant, more willing to use what they had rather than borrowing from everyone else ?

&gt; How difficult is it to get vegetarian food?

In Istanbul most places will do vegetarian dishes but you might need to ask a waiter which ones are vegetarian. You can buy vegetarian food in supermarkets too.

&gt; How safe is the city for outsiders?

Istanbul is a huge city (the 5th biggest in the world). It's fairly safe as long as you use your common sense. Just be careful around Taksim and Beyoglu after midnight, probably steer clear of Aksaray. Levent is a fairly nice neighbourhood, when I'm in Istanbul I live not far from neighbouring Besiktas, which is mostly fine.

&gt; What is the cost of living and average salaries around? Is finding accommodation easy for a foreigner?

The cost of living is quite high, everything keeps going up in price. Salaries really depend on what you're doing and who for. Finding accommodation for a foreigner isn't hard, finding decent, affordable accommodation is, even if you're a foreigner. If your employer is paying for it try a short term let in somewhere like Polat Tower or Selenium Residence - it's not that far from Levent. If not, then you're probably going to want to stay somewhere like Etiler or Maslak.

&gt; Any other advice for me?

Learn a little Turkish if you can. Some Turks (even in Istanbul) don't understand English particularly well, even a Merhaba, Tesekkur ederim or an Iyi Gunler shows that you're at least trying. Turkish is a really easy language to learn as well for the most part, easier than most European languages.",0,Turkey,False

After graduation, I applied for many digital hardware design jobs, some programming jobs related to hardware, some IT jobs but got no responses. I started applying for anything related to computer engineering so I ended up applying for a job at Boeing in Houston, TX (I lived in Pittsburgh, PA). The job was a ""Systems Safety Engineer"" working on the Space Shuttle Program, Orbiter project. I got an interview over the phone, job offer a week later, and moved to Houston a month after that.

Since then I've worked in the Safety and Reliability Engineering field, specifically working on NASA projects. I switched to Firmware Engineering for a NASA contractor on site at Johnson Space Center for one year in order not to get pigeon-holed as a Safety and Reliability Engineer. However, I was offered a very lucrative Safety and Reliability Engineering contractor job less than a year later so I went back to the field. I worked there for over 2 years and really got to enjoy what I was doing. I decided to move to Europe (got so sick of America it's not even funny) but stay in my field. I found a job and am currently working for an Irish company in Dublin, Ireland working on space projects as a Product Assurance Engineer (basically engineering plus loads of quality assurance tasks). Currently I am working on a project for European Space Agency. My company is one of top two flight test instrumentation companies in the world (that's right, Irish are one of the top two) and now we are expanding into the space industry.

When there was an interest in writing in the vernacular and writing grammars in said languages, people were heavily influenced by Latin since, as far as they knew, that was how grammars work.

A main ingredient in Propecia is Saw Palmetto. A herb that's currently prescribed by doctors in Europe for hair loss. It's a safe, natural, cheaper alternative that won't mess with your chemistry as much as conventional hair loss treatment.

The two main reasons for hair loss is your diet and stress level. There's no coincidence that Asians have one of the healthiest diets in the world and just so happens to have the most awesome hair well into old age. The 'genetics' excuse is a cop out to the real problem that most of us, Americans, are too lazy to face; Our fast, fatty, sugar filled, DHT spiking meals. 

If you look at Japan, male pattern baldness was almost unheard of prior to World War II. The Japanese diet is now far more fatty and Westernized, and Japanese men are going bald everywhere. It's clear that a high-fat, meat-based diet raises testosterone levels, and that may adversely affect hair follicles.

Start taking fish oil, a good multivitamin, saw palmetto berry extract, apple flavonoids, clean up your diet, and incorporate a daily meditation regimen.

&gt; The International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust was a two-day conference that opened on December 11, 2006, in Tehran, Iran. The Iranian Foreign Minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, said the conference sought ""neither to deny nor prove the Holocaust... [but] to provide an appropriate scientific atmosphere for scholars to offer their opinions in freedom about a historical issue.""[1] The 67 attendees from 30 countries[2][3] included the American David Duke, former member of the Louisiana House of Representatives and Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan; Austrian Jew Moshe Aryeh Friedman; Holocaust deniers Robert Faurisson, Fredrick Töben, Richard Krege, and Ahmed Rami; Canadian political science professor Shiraz Dossa; and the American Yisroel Dovid Weiss of Neturei Karta.[4]
&gt;
&gt; The conference was widely described as a ""Holocaust denial conference"" or a ""meeting of Holocaust deniers"",[5][6][7] and provoked worldwide criticism.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad_and_Israel#Allegations_that_Zionists_have_taken_over_the_world

&gt; In a speech broadcast on IRINN on September 18 and 23, 2008, Ahmadinejad stated:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The Zionists are crooks. A small handful of Zionists, with a very intricate organization, have taken over the power centers of the world. According to our estimates, the main cadre of the Zionists consists of 2,000 individuals at most, and they have another 8,000 activists. In addition, they have several informants, who spy and provide them with intelligence information. But because of their control of power centers in the U.S. and Europe, and their control of the financial centers and the news and propaganda agencies, they spread propaganda as if they were the entire world, as if all the peoples supported them, and as if they were the majority ruling the world.[98]
&gt;
&gt;At a Holocaust conference at Sharif University of Technology in Tehran on January 27, 2009, Ahmadinejad stated:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;""Today the Zionists dominate many of the world's centers of power, wealth, and media. Unfortunately, they have ensnared many politicians and parties, and they are plundering the wealth and assets of nations in this way, depriving peoples of their freedoms and destroying their cultures and human values by spreading their nexus of corruption.""",0,worldnews,False

Of course not.  But by its definition, each entitlement is designed to be available only to those who prove they do not succeed.  Food stamps only if you prove your poverty.  Social Security Disability only if a doctor signs off on your inabilities.  

Class Envy is the currency of the Socialist.  It is a fact of life in every nation of the world in every era of history that there are those who have more and those who have less.  It is especially true in countries where socialist revolutions have been sold to the hoopleheads by the folks who end up being the new elite.  What makes the US different (and, yes...better) than those countries is that every citizen, no matter what their station in life, has equal opportunity to work, connive, worm, or otherwise weasel his way to the top.

While you'd love to believe that everyone who is rich must've inherited it, that's more the European royalty legacy which we fled.  Every day, legions of young capitalists graduate from business school or start up a business and crush their competition on their way to riches.

Your crying about how your semi-fulltime employment (is it 30 or 40?) doesn't grant you the complete freedom of having your own apartment moves me not at all.  Not every job, even worked fulltime, should pay enough to guarantee a man the lifestyle that you seem to think you are entitled to.  Dopey teenagers and restless retirees need work, too.  Someone has to put on the nametag and step-and-fetch-it.

I wasn't trying to imply, although in retrospect it seems that way, that because a majority of architects and engineers have looked into the data and they all agree that something fishy was going on.  I wasn't trying to make the ""4 out of 5 dentists recommend crest"" argument.  I was simply saying that many architects and engineers who have looked into these facts have said that a new investigation is needed.  

The suspicious facts surrounding the collapse of the WTC buildings were 
completely inconsistent with the official explanation, and these architects and engineers who have years of training and probably years of experience all agree that the facts don't jive with the official explanation. Given that, they all agree that a new independent investigation with full subpoena power is needed.  Many people resist this because its just too upsetting to consider that our government could be so corrupt that it would orchestrate such a heinous crime. But wouldn't it be worse to live in a country that allowed such a crime to go unpunished?  The rule of law is the foundation of our country, and without it, what do we have?  

Here are some of the facts that these 1451 trained professionals agree are inconsistent with the official explanation.  If more architects and engineers saw this web site then I'm sure that number would be higher. 

WTC Building #7, a 47-story high-rise not hit by an airplane, exhibited all the characteristics of classic controlled demolition with explosives:

1. Rapid onset of collapse

2. Sounds of explosions at ground floor – a second before the building's destruction

3. Symmetrical ""structural failure"" – through the path of greatest resistance – at free-fall acceleration

4. Imploded, collapsing completely, and landed in its own footprint

5. Massive volume of expanding pyroclastic dust clouds

6. Expert corroboration from the top European controlled demolition professional

7. Foreknowledge of ""collapse"" by media, NYPD, FDNY

In the the aftermath of WTC7's destruction, strong evidence of demolition using incendary devices was discovered:

8. FEMA finds rapid oxidation and intergranular melting on structural steel samples

9. Several tons of molten metal reported by numerous highly qualified witnesses

10. Chemical signature of the incendiary thermite found in solidified molten metal, and dust samples

WTC7 exhibited none of the characteristics of destruction by fire:

1. Slow onset with large visible deformations

2. Asymmetrical collapse which follows the path of least resistance (laws of conservation of momentum would cause a falling, to the side most damaged by the fires)

3. Evidence of fire temperatures capable of softening steel

4. High-rise buildings with much larger, hotter, and longer lasting fires have never collapsed.

important polemical edit, related to the above:

differently from other american colonies,

the portuguese in brazil, screwed their black slaves, 

a lot,

hence giving them more slaves,

but in the long run, creating a substantial population of mulattos.

these latter also mixed up with the later droves of immigrants from japan, europe, an rest of asia in the last 150 yrs.

for some reason the mixing of races, in Brazil, has always been seen as natural and positive as opposed to in the US where ethnical ghettos form, and multi racial couples have a hard time.

so this explains:

1- why brazil has less racial issues than america (though big income inequality - not related to race tho),

2- why women (and supposedly man) are better looking in there,

3- and why culturally, its more homogenous than the US (a fact which makes Brazil more boring imho).

1) The US is a strange aberration. The situation is different in every other goddamn industrialized country in the world, but for whatever reasons, the US has remained both religious and prosperous. So the religious moderates may very well be different in the US than in normal, civilized countries (yes, I'm exaggerating :P ) like in Western Europe and Canada. That doesn't mean that we get to reject all religious moderates everywhere.

2) You list a number of issues that ""whip Christians into righteous anger"". But many of those are issues which moderates *are* okay with. Homosexuality and abortion have been accepted by many of the mainline churches, and science education is encouraged by them! So why do they continue to vote for religious-oriented politicians, etc.? I would argue that at least one major reason is *not* because the evangelicals are goading them into it, but rather because religion is seen as such a divisive issue in the US that they feel like they are voting *against* their religion if they don't vote for the ""good guy""! That's even if they don't completely agree with everything he/she says. But if atheists were to actively support the liberal elements of the religious moderates, they might not feel as threatened for voting for what they actually support. When you make it an us-or-them issue, you're playing into the evangelicals' hands. You're playing their game. When you focus on the actual issues instead of focusing on the religion, you allow people to vote on what they actually support.

And from what I understand, moderates are in typically favour of separation of church and state, secularism, and generally keeping religion a private issue. *It's in our best interest to encourage that.*

3) I never claimed that ""all beliefs warrant equal consideration and respect"". I do believe that we should keep an open mind, of course, but I don't respect beliefs for the sake of beliefs. What I *do* believe is that we should not condemn people for things they don't believe and don't support. In as much as these religious moderates *do* support bad policies like restrictions on abortion, etc., they should be called out on it. But when they *don't* support it, we should be standing alongside with them, not telling them ""Well you're still a crazy religious nut!"" I'm not advocating a shelter from criticism, I'm advocating a more finely-tuned criticism to, you know, apply it to what people actually believe rather than painting with a broad brush.

4) Your point about identifying as Christians on polls is a good one, and I do agree that it is unfortunate. But again, I think this goes back to the problem of making religion a polarizing issue, especially in politics. The problem is not that they identify as Christians; the problem is that the politicians then see that as in any way relevant to what they decide about things. That's an issue for you Americans to work out, and it takes time, unfortunately. Alternately, one could try to convince the pollsters to divide up ""Christian"" into several different categories to make a better distinction between them. But either way, the issue there is really with the politics, not with the fact that people identify as ""Christian"".

5) Finally, I read Diabolico's argument, and to a large extent I agree. I have no problem with condemning moderates for not speaking up loud enough about the issues they support. But at the same time, if we as atheists (or non-Christians in general) continue to lump them in with the crazies, what does that say about us? It is saying that religious affiliation is far more important to us than these issues that we supposedly support. You're saying to them, ""The fact that you are a Christian is more condemnable to me than the fact that you don't speak up loudly enough about gay marriage."" My argument was that this is the wrong approach. If you both support gay marriage, *unite together and say so*. Don't accuse them of being silent if you constantly make them a non-entity and condemn them no matter what they say or don't say. This is the wrong approach.

In short, what I'm saying is: If you want to completely eradicate all religious belief (which probably is not a realistic goal, to be honest), go ahead and continue to condemn all religious believers, no matter what. If, however, you find that religious intrusion into public life is a more important issue than one's own private beliefs, then one should be uniting with the people who *agree* with you that religious intrusion into public life is an important issue! It's a matter of priorities here, and if you *want* the religious moderates to speak up about these issues that need to be dealt with, *encourage* them to do it and *support* them when they do instead of continuing to criticize them for being religious.

Anyway, with all that said, I do thank you for your comment. I hope that we can at least find some sort of agreement on some part of this, because I think it's an important issue to talk about. ",0,atheism,False

My stupid adviser was some bimbo without any common sense (she taught me there's absolutely no point in listening to college advisers)  and we were trying to decide which science class I should take to knock out one last science prerequisite.

There were two other students in the class that sat with me in the front row asking questions.  The entire class was meteorology students who would sigh every time we raised our hands to ask our stupid questions.  They were all taking it as a blow off class, which is why the professor decided he wasn't going to allow his class to be a blow-off class, and thus it was RIDICULOUSLY hard for the three of us non-meteorology students.  I remember a couple things that struck me as interesting; He said we still don't know what causes tornadoes.  We only know the ingredients and we have a few theories as to why they form. (maybe this has changed in the last 10 years?)  Oh, and it was highly controversial whether or not the big May 3rd twister was an f6.  Several meteorologists in Oklahoma were convinced it was.

1) Players with only Vanilla accounts can roll a Blood Elf or Draenei. And even if they wanted to travel to the BE/Draenei zones to do content there, they would have to really go out of their way to travel there.

2) A player capped at level 60 can really find a use for Zul'Aman and the Isle of Quel'Danas.

3) You can fly around Azeroth without the Cataclysm expansion which requires the Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King to activate as well.

How about changing Random Battlegrounds so that they no longer give you only a drip rate of Honor if your battlegroup faction is shit at battlegrounds.

I used to PvP on Blackout EU Alliance side*, and while the Alliance constantly get instant to 2 minute BG queues, it is almost torturous to only gain about 50 Honor in 10 - 25 minutes of being corpse camped by a superior opposing faction.

Actually, since battlegroups now apparently no longer apply, why not just give everybody a free Vicious Gladiator set in 4.1 so we don't have to waterboard ourselves with doing dozens of battlegrounds a day just for 1 piece.

(*I actually gave up Ret PvP after seeing the Word of Glory/Sacred Shield over-nerf in this patch.)

&gt; * Players who die at a control point that they own will now be teleported to the next closest graveyard, instead of the one at which they died.
&gt; * If a player's team owns the Mine and Waterworks, and dies at Waterworks, they will be teleported to the Mine.
&gt; * If an Alliance player's team only owns Lighthouse, and dies at Lighthouse, they will respawn at their base.
&gt; * If a Horde player's team owns Waterworks and Mine, and dies at Lighthouse, they will respawn at Waterworks.

Because this isn't going to turn Battle of Gilneas into a several minute rape-fest?

I fear that the first faction to fuck up will lose, because if they are spawning at their previously owned base or their starting points when only one base is remaining for them, whats stopping the winning faction from just zerging the opponent and winning the game in a matter of minutes?

&gt; Resilience scaling has been modified for linear returns, as opposed to increasing returns. Under the new formula, going from 30 resilience to 40 resilience gives players the same increase to survivability as going from 0 to 10. Resilience now scales in the same way armor and magic resistances do. A player with 32.5% damage reduction from resilience in 4.0.6 should see their damage reduction unchanged in 4.1. Those with less than 32.5% will gain slightly. Those with more will lose some damage reduction, increasingly so as their resilience climbs.

Still doesn't fix the fact that at low levels of Resilience, you will get creamed in a matter of seconds the moment you enter a battlegrond. And this is why I think that introducing Resilience in the first place was the single biggest mistake ever made with this game. Because it has segregated PvE and PvP gear, made both sets of stats almost incompatiable in each other's settings and made players have to carry an unecessary amount of gear.

Besides, craftable sets aren't the best way to alleviate this problem because they are often worse than the stuff you can get for Honor and are ridiculously expensive on the AH, or to craft.

The problem I see with arguments like this is that the ""rich"" in the colonies were far poorer than the rich of Europe; compare Mount Vernon to Versailles.  

Granted, many of the founders consciously modeled themselves on the classical Romans and Greeks - with all the social inequality that entailed.  Still, their revolution brought representative rule, the end of colonial exploitation, and a general flattening of social distinctions.  By my measure that represents an impressive - if imperfect - improvement on British colonial rule.  

Mapping class warfare onto this world of growing republicanism seems anachronistic and small.  Aristocrats had a legitimate part in the American Revolution; they provided intellectual heft and the capital necessary to raise and furnish the revolutionary army.  The author also fails to grasp that late 18th century military technology all but necessitated massed-volley tactics and this kind of organization.

The working poor were better off under home rule, period.  They were able to elect representative governments, and they weren't paying colonial taxes any longer.  Most importantly, though, they were rid of the odious British class system.

The British Empire and the French had large-ish colonial empires.

The UK, Netherlands and France had traditions of democracy in some form or other, but not Germany, Austria-Hungary, or Russia (to consider all participants in WW1 and 2).

Post-WW2, the US could have made the same mistake they did in WW1: Up and leave without any lasting contributions. It took a common enemy (the Soviet Union), to get the US involved in world politics beyond the Monroe Doctrine. Which is sad, but it lead to a peace in Europe lasting for 66 years, and a fully integrated Germany, which now *has* a strong democratic tradition.

Miami, New York and Boston did nothing but play with the cap and come out on top. Allen, Garnett and O'Neal all signed for less than they were supposed to earn. Pierce is probably the only one still making ""superstar"" money in Boston. LeBron, Wade and Bosh all make around 10 mil per season. Considering each of them could be signing for 20 mil per season they all ""compromised"".

This same cap has made it impossible for low-level teams, such as the Clippers, Grizzlies and Bucks, to compete with other teams. Since they can't offer a championship team (because of not enough cap space to sign good role players) big-name players don't sign with them because they know they'll be playing alone. Besides, who wants to live in Milwaukee? These franchises also suffer from terrible management but they were never able to attract players regardless of management (they couldn't offer 20 mil each for 3 or 4 players even if they had the market/money for it because of the cap).

Then there's the commissioner's meddling favoring big teams. New York was always favored, given all room they needed to get their shit together and even actively helped towards that. When they went over the cap by millions with the Isiah Thomas administration the NBA did nothing. The Lakers got away with the biggest steal in the history of basketball by trading Kwame Brown for Paul Gasol (for non-NBA fans, that's like trading the absolute worst EPL player -- whoever he is -- for Berbatov). The NBA never said ""hey this isn't fair game to Memphis, Gasol is worth more than Brown"", they applauded the chance of a Lakers-Celtic final (and got two of them). Were they serious about making teams competitive they'd have halted the trade. Not to mention referees flat out stealing games for the big-market teams or interfering with playoff series (like LA-Boston last year).

However, the article misses one thing: when *didn't* the same teams finish top? The 21st century's West Conference was always LA-San Antonio-Dallas-Phoenix up top, with Sacramento in the beginning of the century. The East was always based on single stars, with Iverson carrying Philly, Kidd carrying New Jersey, Ewing carrying New York, Miller carrying Indiana, Carter carrying Toronto, the Hamilton-Billups-Wallace triumvirate carrying Detroit, now LeBron carrying Cleveland. With all of those out those teams it was obvious they would fall through the ranks.

If you go back to the 90s it was roughly the same picture. The champions from the mid-to-late 80s until today were always the same: Lakers, Celtics, Pistons, Bulls with the very rare deviations from the norm with Blazers, Rockets, Spurs and Heat.

The NBA's problem of competitiveness is tied with its thirst for money. So much is invested into making more money that the real problems are ignored. This new collective bargaining agreement is another way to make money: instead of taking money out of the pockets of the NBA and its owners (like European teams do, like eating from Abramovich/Mansour), the NBA tries to fix its financial problems by restricting player salaries and implicating more and more restrictions. If teams could sign players for how much they wanted there'd be a shift in power, specially with the Nets coming out big. Not that it's the correct thing but the cap doesn't work, people should stop fooling themselves.

Anyway, I completely deviated from the discussion, sorry. I think the comparison is a little late because the NBA was always a little like the EPL, not competitive enough. The difference is that there are 29 (30 now) teams instead of 20, and 16 teams instead of 4 go to the title run. That's why you get some apparent competition, but it has never been a haven for competitiveness.",0,soccer,False

-The republican party encourages innovation and self reliance. Democrats tend to support public and government solutions that create dependence on those institutions. Its like the farmer's adage, ""If I can feed it, I own it"". I think the promise of welfare motivates voters more than reddit realizes.

- Republicans are less racist than democrats overall. With liberals: Race. Is. Everything. They are obsessed with it. They can not look past someone's skin any more than a KKK member. It comes up in every discussion and drives all the silly political correctness we must endure in society. I am fine with just being equal and being treated like everyone else. Sure the ""hateful rhetoric"" filled south has some racists. Ever been to some parts of new york, Chicago, or Memphis? The Racism is palatable between parts of the cities. I would say those urban areas are primarily democrat.

- Social issues are important. Abortion, affirmative action, public programs. I don't want all those things. 

-Recently, the republican party has been the anti-socialist party (whether they actually do it is another discussion). However, some of the founding fathers did believe in social welfare, but America was doing fine without it until FDR. I don't want the country to take that direction. Its that simple. I don't care what Europe does. We're Americans, when did we ever care what they did. Our nation is bigger than any one nation over there and we have a different culture.

Having said all that, many republicans at the top are corrupt and useless (the same could be said of democrats). But remember; half of the country identifies themselves as ""republican"" or ""conservative"". Don't let the corrupt idiots at the top define the party for you. I used to think the same of democrats and it was stupid, shallow, and I formulated bad ideas for the future of my nation.

The only glaring flaw I see with the republican party is their lack of care for those in poverty (the bottom %10). By definition of american conservative, the government can't take care of those people, but the democrats take it to the other extreme and use it to fuel the entire party. Ideally, the rest of society should take care of them, but that doesn't always happen. That's a people problem though, not a job for the government.",0,politics,False

* He is a normal, average middle aged guy, 5'11"", 206lbs (at the start) and he ends up at 194lbs, with better bloodwork.

* He uses common sense, you can eat fast food, just don't be a retard about it and plow down a 4000 calorie meal every day.

* He keeps his calories at around 2,000 every day for 30 days, which for someone his size (me too at 5'11"") is a minor deficit, vs the quoted 5,000 cal a day for Super Size Me, and honestly, eating that much of *anything* will make you fat.

* He does get some exercise, he previously went for a walk 3 days a week, he bumped it up to 6 days a week, and he also does some light band work for muscular fitness (which he did prior).

* His main point is that you should be eating more fruits and vegetables, less complex carbs and getting some exercise.  This is a pretty core concept I think we can all agree on.  However, another of his main points was that conceptually the types of fats and cholesterols we've been taught to avoid, are not necessarily that bad for you and removing them from your diet can actually be harmful.  Case in point some of these vegetable oils we eat, which man has never had in his diet until recently (when, surprise, there was a surge in obesity), and are only removed through a chemical extraction process.

* There are [several experts](http://www.fathead-movie.com/index.php/meet-the-experts/) he consults with in the film, some of which you are probably familiar with already and the [recommended reading](http://www.fathead-movie.com/index.php/recommended-reading/) he suggests is hardly junk science

So... I'd recommend giving it a view with an open mind, don't succumb to the brainwashing we've been fed over the years about what is good for you and what isn't.  Make observations and draw conclusions.  10 years ago we all thought it was **fact** that the traditional food pyramid with stacks of grains and carbs was the most healthy diet, but these days we know better and it is undergoing changes of its own.

One of the things makes it a great response is that he actively mocks the Super Size Me author and it is hilarious.

Here's some things to chew on:

* There’s never been a single study that proves saturated fat causes heart disease.

* As heart-disease rates were skyrocketing in the mid-1900s, consumption of animal fat was going down, not up. Consumption of vegetable oils, however, was going up dramatically.

* Half of all heart-attack victims have normal or low cholesterol. Autopsies performed on heart-attack victims routinely reveal plaque-filled arteries in people whose cholesterol was low (as low as 115 in one case).

* Asian Indians - half of whom are vegetarians - have one of the highest rates of heart disease in the entire world. Yup, that fatty meat will kill you, all right.

* When Morgan Spurlock tells you that a McDonald’s salad supplies almost a day’s allowance of fat, he’s basing that statement on the FDA’s low-fat/high-carbohydrate dietary guidelines, which in turn are based on … absolutely nothing. There’s no science behind those guidelines; they were simply made up by a congressional committee.

* Kids who were diagnosed as suffering from ADD have been successfully treated by re-introducing natural saturated fats into their diets. Your brain is made largely of fat.

* Many epileptics have reduced or eliminated seizures by adopting a diet low in sugar and starch and high in saturated animal fats.

* Despite everything you’ve heard about saturated fat being linked to cancer, that link is statistically weak. However, there is a strong link between sugar and cancer. In Europe, doctors tell patients, “Sugar feeds cancer.”
Being fat is not, in and of itself, bad for your health. The behaviors that can make you fat - eating excess sugar and starch, not getting any exercise - can also ruin your health, and that’s why being fat is associated with bad health. But it’s entirely possible to be fat and healthy. It’s also possible to be thin while developing Type II diabetes and heart disease.

* Saturated fat and cholesterol help produce testosterone. When men limit their saturated fat, their testosterone level drops. So, regardless of what a famous vegan chef believes, saturated fat does not impair sexual performance.",0,Documentaries,False

Italy is also facing a similar crisis which, in this case, may be linked to Italians' more traditional views on the family, as contrasted with other industrialized nations. 

&gt;The Italian population is getting smaller and it is also getting older. The fertility rate - at 1.33 children per woman - is one of the lowest in the Western world. And more than one in five of the population in Italy is now over 65.

Interestingly enough, Sweden also has this issue, but it's not as bad as that in Italy and other Southern European nations; the NY Times suggests, perhaps, that this is due to the country's generous social welfare system, which means there's fewer economic risks to having children. 

&gt;But some societies have done a better job than others of reconciling the conflicting forces. In Europe, many countries with greater gender equality have a greater social commitment to day care and other institutional support for working women, which gives those women the possibility of having second or third children. ... This is a crucial difference between the north — including France and the United Kingdom and the Scandinavian countries — and the south. The Scandinavian countries have both the most vigorous social-welfare systems in Europe and — at 1.8 — among the highest fertility rates.

Second off, I'm not questioning OP's symptoms. And this isn't a rant, despite its length. I'm really truly sorry to hear his story, in fact. I'm quite empathetic, having been on some sort of 5ar-reductase inhibitor (propecia/finasteride ""fin""; Avodart/Avidart/dutasteride ""dut"") since 1999, when I was ~19. At the time, I was the youngest patient ever to whom my doc prescribed fin. I have often worried what these things are doing to my system, and what differences might be detected if I stopped taking them.  I'm over 30 now though and all blood tests and physicals find no abnormalities in me.  Just had some great morning sex too (ok, fine, oogled the Sears catalog). 

But that's personal anecdote and should be used to inform a search for information and risk/benefit analysis, just as any other anecdotes about my 5 close friends who are on it, and are fine, and credit me with being open and honest about my experience with propecia for saving their hair.  But therein lies my problem with this post and the thread in general.  If you are taking a drug---any drug---you are a data point. Your experience will vary, as will your results.  And drug companies, and the armies of CROs and scientists which they employ and collaborate with, do their best to take from that data what works, what doesn't, and what risks are emerging.  I'm surprised at how many upvoted comments are taking this example as gospel, that propecia causes ED in everyone, and the companies are just not telling us, despite Reddit's normal adherence to proper statistical inference.  

Merck (and GSK for dut) are very aware that this category of drugs will be taken for a very long time by its users. That's a big deal for decision makers involved in development and management of the drug once it's in the market.  And there's someone out there who stands to make a lot of money, or a competitive advantage, from a Merck/GSK scandal.  Which is actually quite good, knowing that there are at least some incentives to seize upon negative data, such as your experience, and not only incentive to hide the bad. I have no doubt, however, that data in drug studies of all stripes has been massaged at the margins, both in terms of efficacy and safety. Sometimes in the extreme (think: Vioxx). But, as scandals and lawsuits show, full suppression of data (and any emerging ""Phase IV"" trends) is exceptionally stupid, legally speaking, not to mention difficult. 

To imply that these companies know about a huge (and permanent) ED risk, above and beyond the stated libido side effects, and are suppressing that, is to mobilize fear and emotion to sell your side of the argument. Which is apparently gaining some catharsis from an FDA ban.  That's not responsible.  If there isn't enough publicity, first get your facts and support in order, then get the public involved.  Don't follow the anti-vaxers. Cosmetic though it may be, baldness is quite unpleasant to many.  Just as any cosmetic condition is, like bad acne or rosacea. If you scare someone away from using fin/dut who might have benefited from it with little or no side effects, than you have advanced your cause at the cost of someone else's happiness.  Give information, not emotion.  No matter how awful your experience is, we need objective data to base decisions on. Linking as ""proof"" to sites set up only to distribute the negative propecia experiences is not responsible.  Even if all of those experiences are true and can be substantiated objectively, they need to be weighed and compared to the substantive evidence on the positive side.  If drugs had to have no downsides we would have no medicine at all. 

To that end, people reading this post should be aware that the propecia-downvote brigade have been loud and active since, to my knowledge, at least 2006/2007.  There are plenty of discussions over at [different hairloss forums](www.hairlosstalk.com) and I'd suggest you go info-mining there for proper due-diligence.  They are quite vocal, but so is the pros side.  But I say good for the propecia-haters, in fact, for coming together and asking great questions like: ""is anyone else getting these problems?  Can we attribute them to the drug? How does the drug affect us like this?""  But the severity of the side effect and its effect on their lives derails their otherwise laudable goals onto a populist track. Being loud and active (like flaming any and every pro-propecia or anti pharma-conspiracy reply in this thread) is not the same as being numerically supported.  Perhaps being loud and vocal is necessary to get the ball rolling and the word out, but there needs to be an objective core developed once any momentum---like a well-trafficked site---begins.  

Other posters have already noted and commented on some problems with some studies quoted by---or done by---propeciahelp.com.  There is A LOT of data on 5ar inhibitors, collected not only from hairloss sufferers but the huge population of male BPH sufferers for whom these were first approved.  Just for starters, we have [this study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00563.x/abstract) that was much discussed when I started seeing the emergence of concerns of permanent side effects on message boards.  There are other studies, however, that have support or raise red flags about the possibility of indeed developing long-lasting side effects, or that the incidence is at least significantly higher than what Merck/GSK states.  And hence, the new EU warnings on the prescription. So there is reason for concern and to watch for trends, especially as the population of 5ar-i users grows and ages.  Given another recent large study on Dut, which showed decreased incidence of prostate cancer, we may be seeing even more users coming in, especially from high cancer risk categories as some urologists start using 5ar-i therapy as preventative medicine. But maybe for hairloss sufferers, because this is purely cosmetic, any remote risk of a permanent downside will wash out any benefits.  But let's focus on proving that, or elucidating the situations where it is most likely to occur (sensitive subpopulations, etc), so we can make informed decisions about the risks we take with our bodies relative to the benefits. If there is a risk, with a big impact, that is not acknowledged of advanced with enough emphasis by the company or docs, then let's change that.  And I applaud the OP for being part of that movement, and bringing the nugget of info to the male-heavy reddit population.  But please wage a war of information, don't incite a riot (by, for instance, telling everyone in the thread who admits to being on or wanting to try fin/dut that they're playing with fire, or sitting on a ticking time bomb.)

&gt; No profits to pay, nor huge bonii to executives &amp; board members

Who is in charge of public health care and how does he/she gets selected? I ask because in some LatAm countries such positions are usually used as trampolines for a higher government position in government. For instance: you're a doctor and a member of political party X so you get to be Minister of Social Security. After that position you get to be Governor of a city and then you run from president (partly finance by money and favours obtained from your previous positions). So how does Canada does it?

&gt; No time and resources lost to determine if such-and-such procedure is covered-or-not for so-and-so (everyone get the same coverage)

I hate to use the ""freedom"" argument user thened referred to but really, what if I need more coverage or if I want less? In Chile they had, at least a while ago, a system where each person handled their social security ""account"" as they would a bank account in the sense that they could see it grow in time and could choose coverage from different providers (including a public provider) depending on their needs and expectations.

If the health-insurer is public, what do you mean that you ease the burden on social services. What services are you referring to if not health insurance?

&gt; No burden on employers, as coverage is given by the State

How does the State finance this? In Europe, for instance, both employers and employees pay for social security. Are employers free from any and all health care expenses in Canada?

&gt; No burden on Society, as no one can be bankrupted because he is being dumped by his insurer

What do you mean by ""burden""? The State has to financed health care from what society produces through taxes and the like right? What am I missing?

&gt; what are the economic reasons that justify that the USA has not taken this route?

Competition usually ensures that the most efficient providers will survive while the less efficient are taken out of business. By efficiency I mean they provide what the customer wants for the best price/quality ratio. If you don't have a market for health insurance (i.e. different providers competing for customers) then its practically impossible to know whether you are being efficient. You may know whether you're being effective but without competitors you can't know whether you are incurring unnecessary expenses or wasting time etc. because you have nothing to compare it against, thus you can't measure efficiency. Well, you can compare it to international providers but since each country has different economic realities its usually not a very good comparison.",0,Economics,False

After that position you get to be Governor of a city and then you run from president (partly finance by money and favours obtained from your previous positions). So how does Canada does it?

Professional bureaucrats (whose competence is asserted through various evaluation and selection mechanisms) are in charge; they follow established guidelines to provide services.

&gt; I hate to use the ""freedom"" argument user thened referred to but really, what if I need more coverage or if I want less? In Chile they had, at least a while ago, a system where each person handled their social security ""account"" as they would a bank account in the sense that they could see it grow in time and could choose coverage from different providers (including a public provider) depending on their needs and expectations. I've heard Singapore has a similar system so there must be some advantages to that system don't you think?

If you want more coverage, you can always buy it from insurance companies; in fact, many workers are covered by such programmes through their employers as social benefits. However, those benefits are mostly frills, so you can go easily without such coverage.

And no, you cannot have less coverage; universal means that everybody gets the same thing. It’s not a question of freedom, it’s a question of social obligation which nobody questions.

&gt; If the health-insurer is public, what do you mean that you ease the burden on social services. What services are you referring to if not health insurance?

I am talking about programs (in the US) that cover uninsured people; they necessarly cost more per capita than universal insurance because their risk pool is much worse than the universal pool.

&gt; How does the State finance this? In Europe, for instance, both employers and employees pay for social security. Are employers free from any and all health care expenses in Canada?

It is paid for through taxes by the general fund, whose income has sales, excise and income tax, as well as profits from crown corporations (the government own some entreprises that generate hefty profits — and thus decrease the tax burden for everyone).

&gt; &gt; No burden on Society, as no one can be bankrupted because he is being dumped by his insurer

&gt;What do you mean by ""burden""? The State has to financed health care from what society produces through taxes and the like right? What am I missing?

This is what I said: every bankrupcy is a burden on society, so avoiding health-related bankrupcies ultimately benefits society.

&gt; Competition usually ensures that the most efficient providers will survive while the less efficient are taken out of business. 

Competition cannot work for insurance, because the most efficient insurance is one that draws from the largest risk pool possible. This is why government health-insurance in Canada is so much efficient than in the US, it’s huge risk pool allows it to have only 5% overhead. This means that 95% of the money in the system goes to patients themselves.

&gt; By efficiency I mean they provide what the customer wants for the best price/quality ratio. 

The canadian system gives the best price/quality ratio. I mean, only 5% overhead!!!

&gt; If you don't have a market for health insurance (i.e. different providers competing for customers) then its practically impossible to know whether you are being efficient.

Sure it is, just look at the 5% overhead.

And with private insurers, the efficiency metric is the bottom-line, which totally works against the customers.

&gt; You may know whether you're being effective but without competitors you can't know whether you are incurring unnecessary expenses or wasting time etc. because you have nothing to compare it against, thus you can't measure efficiency. Well, you can compare it to international providers but since each country has different economic realities its usually not a very good comparison.

Well, in a nutshell, 5% pretty much sums up everything when you compare it to the grossly abysmal 35% overhead of the US.

Yes.

Finland and Sweden are both nations with over 70% workers in unions were it is still possible to have no legally or contractually mandated minimum wage.

You misread that wikipedia article because it only covers workers in economic sectors that don't have collective bargaining agreements set up.

If you aren't in the right economic sector, than neither the government nor the unions will protect your wages in those nations.

&gt;Do you realize that you've picked two socialist countries where high levels of unionism correlate with fantastic labor conditions?

We weren't talking about conditions, we were talking about whether Unions correlated with government protections, and I pointed out an example where they don't.

Germany, France, the UK all have less than half the number of Union membership than Finland and Sweden, yet those countries have minimum wage laws and Finland and Sweden don't.

You were saying that you need Unions to push through legislation for worker protections.

(though you've also implied that countries with strong government protections don't need strong unions, which contradicts the point you're now making about Finland and Sweden having strong protections because they have strong unions)

&gt;Please see:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_validity_of_collective_labour_agreements

You do realize that if you aren't in an economic sector covered by a collective labor agreement, then you aren't covered for the minimum wage, which was exactly the point I was making?

&gt;In Finland, Universal validity of collective labour agreements is a condition that a collective agreement **in an economic sector** becomes a universally applicable legal minimum for any individual's employment contract, union member or not.

&gt;Workers are not forced to join a union in a specific workplace. Nevertheless, with 70% average unionization, **most economic sectors are under a collective labour agreement.**

Most. Not all. Meaning Finland and Sweden are among the few nations in Europe were it can be legal to pay a worker 10 cents an hour, even though they have the highest rates of Union membership, which discounts your claim that unions are required for government protections.

You don't seem to be capable of discussing one point at a time.

First you claim that my examples weren't relevant because any country that has high standards of living, and low rates of unionism are protected by government (except this doesn't count examples like Switzerland where they have both low rates of union membership, low government protections and higher working conditions).

Then you claimed that this is also a factor of Unionism, since you need Unions to get worker protections. Then I pointed out examples of nations with extremely high rates of union membership, which lack basic legal protections that most other nations in europe already have, even with lower unions.

Then you claim that in fact Finland and Sweden DO have strong unions and DO have high governmental protections on workers which discounts your original claim that weak unions and high standard of living only coexist when there are strong governmental controls in place. 

&gt;You are consistently raising evidence that invalidates your thesis and you seem to be completely unaware of it.

The evidence that demonstrates the effect Unions have on the standards of living of workers is the rate of Union membership over time, compared to the HDI over time, and with any interfering 3rd factors filtered out (for example weighting the effect of GDP per capita to the results).

There is no significant correlation between these two factors in Europe at least. Your idea of disputing the evidence is to pick one example and say ""look, this proves it all wrong"", ignoring the fact you presented no analysis of evidence to support this claim, and that it ignores the larger body of evidence as a whole.

If unions lead to a significant increase in the conditions of workers over time, then you should be able to present evidence that fits this profile.

The simplest way of doing this is to pick nations like Sweden and Norway and say, look, these have high standards of living and they have strong rates of Union membership so its likely Union membership is responsible for this. Except examples like Australia have equally high standards of living and much lower union membership, and not only this, but their increase in standards of living have come after a decrease in union membership.

So to bring this back to the original point, then clearly Unions aren't ""necessary"", since even if the decrease in Union membership has been bad for Australian standards of living, there is something else that is so powerful it is completely overpowering it and leading to the fastest increase in Australian standard of living in history.",0,politics,False

Although many of us didn't get blood tests before hand, we were all living very normal and healthy lives.

És um imbecil. Esta frase não é um insulto, é antes uma constatação de facto. Na véspera de uma manifestação contra a precariedade laboral e financeira os jovens juntam-se para ""tomar uns copos"", é sob todos os prismas passíveis de ser analisada uma atitude pouco condizente com as queixas que vão expressar mais tarde. Não é coerente queixar-se de não ter dinheiro para ser independente quando se gasta tudo em luxos. Esta situação é a puta da definição de **HIPOCRISIA**. Reitero: és um imbecil.

&gt; Ainda por cima quando só têm uma taxa de desemprego muito superior relativamente à da população que não concluiu o ensino superior e que têm, não raras vezes, outra escolha senão aceitar estágios não remunerados ou recibos verdes atrás de recibos verdes... Realmente, a lata de certas pessoas.

Realmente, a lata deste país. Mais! A lata deste mundo! Estou chocado que esta inconveniência de crise global tenha gorado os planos! É inconcebível que o mundo não gire à nossa volta!

&gt; e que têm, não raras vezes, outra escolha senão aceitar estágios não remunerados ou recibos verdes

Entrei com média de 17,9 na universidade. Friso este ponto anterior para deixar claro que não foi por falta de aptidão académica que hoje critico quem escolhe licenciar-se. Eu mesmo estudei durante 3 anos. No entanto três coisas tornaram-se nítidas:  

1. Forte probabilidade de não ter trabalho  
2. Caso tivesse emprego, a remuneração não era o que esperava  
3. Eu gosto de ter estabilidade financeira   

Obviamente decidi procurar outra solução.

A maioria dos meus colegas quis concluir os estudos e procurar emprego nessa mesma área. Acomodaram-se. Que é como quem diz em português vernacular: foderam-se. Metafóricamente estavam a guiar um carro contra a parede e em vez de saltar fora decidiram mudar a estação de rádio. 
  
Eu, por outro lado, saltei fora. Iniciei o meu negócio. Comecei com um investimento mínimo e a trabalhar a partir de casa. Volvidos 5 anos por mês ganho mais do que os supracitados ex-colegas auferem anualmente. Em alguns casos o dobro.

Jewishness is an ethnicity as well as a religion, and it is perfectly possible to be of the ethnicity and not of the religion. It isn't any different than considering yourself Irish or Italian. Because of the way that Jews were treated throughout Europe and other parts of the world, they remained an insular community which caused them to generally remain distinct from the other peoples of the countries that they lived in. 

So saying that someone is ""Jewish"" typically says more about their culture and ancestry than it does about their religion. I married into a partially Jewish family, and I have in-laws that are religiously Jewish, but the vast majority of them only consider themselves to be ethnically Jewish and consider themselves to be atheists if asked about metaphysical beliefs. This may not make sense to you or you may think it is dumb, but it is the way that it is.

I just have to admire the immense discipline it must take for you to ignore the obvious implications of the evidence you've presented, and the creativity it must require for you to rationalize your arguments.  

You selected two nations with extremely high unionization rates, and extremely high levels of government protection, and are arguing from that correlation that unionization rates do not correlate with government protections.  To do so, you ignored the vast labor protections that workers enjoy **by law** in those nations, and seized on the absence of a minimum wage law.  When in point of fact, employers are obligated **by law** to honor minimum wages secured **by unions.** 

So, again, this example (as your earlier example) demonstrates you are in error.  Nations with high rates of union membership tend to have high rates of worker protections.  And in the example of Finland, (your example, remember) it is precisely workers in sectors with high rates of unionization who enjoy the highest level of protection.

The Channel Master is considered a solid choice.  It is a closed box, in terms of getting to the recorded content or expanding the storage, but it will work for you.

The TiVo Premiere is the premium choice.  It can capture OTA HD, however you are paying a premium for a lot of features that lose their usefulness when you only have 10 or 15 stations.  In addition to the cost of the box, you will either have to pay a monthly fee around $13 or pay for a lifetime subscription that is more than the box.  (Around $700 total)

The TViX 6620 is the direction I'm leaning.  It has dual tuners, and the ability to access the storage over your network, plus it is a content streamer itself, so you can stream downloaded content (AVI, MKV, etc.) to it over your network.

Both the Channel Master and the TViX rely on very simplistic programming guides and you will basically be setting up timer recordings like back in the VCR days.  ",0,cordcutters,False

• The EU is to hold a special summit on Libya and north Africa on 11 March. Oil prices have soared to a two and a half year high.

• There has been fighting in Zintan, 90 miles south of Tripoli, where opposition forces managed to repel the pro-Gaddafi military, as they did in Misrata, 125 miles east of the capital.

One major issue I foresee all surviving denominations undergoing is a change in their stance on acceptance of homosexuals in the church. Another I see being a major divisive issue that may result in a schism is Christology being drastically lower in future churches. I'm willing to bet that more literalist and sola scriptura and sola fide churches will die off with more people embracing orthodoxy or catholicism, or at least a new denomination of Christianity that brands itself on being more tradition based than ""anyone can pick up the Bible and be inspired by God"" based.

A number of current Christian denominations will die off, only to be replaced with a number of new ones that are better equipped to handle humanity's ever-changing world view. I don't see a great future for a lot of evangelical protestant churches, but liberal and orthodox churches should do well.

The taz has a long standing feud with one of their competitors called BILD (Europe's largest Newspaper btw), which is what the artwork is about. The taz may be described as an alternative, left-leaning newspaper for intellectuals; BILD is right-wing and a blue-collar newspaper and has some resemblance to FOX NEWS, as it has an equally lax moral-code.

The ""well-endowed"" man is the Editor-in-chief of BILD Kai Diekmann. In 2002 - 7 years before the artwork was installed - the taz printed an article which was supposed to be a satire of BILD methods and how they violated people's privacy. In it they said that Diekmanm had had an operation to enlarge his penis, which went horribly wrong. 

Diekmann promptly sued but was ultimately defeated in court, since the judge ruled that someone that made his living by violating other people's privacy had to accept that his own privacy was being violated as well.

Nope. There were something like 13 million Jews at the time, with 9 million in Europe, of whom approximately two thirds were killed. If it were as high as 11 million there wouldn't be enough Jews left to even found and populate Israel. Though apparently 11 million is the low-end for total victims of the holocaust, or perhaps as high as 17 million. I just find it obnoxious that WW II in America has been boiled down to it only being about the Jews. When I see a historical narrative take such a turn it indicates to me that whoever is talked about the most was ultimately oppressed the least. The Jews have managed to do well in the modern world. The fact that you don't hear about the Gypsies, Poles, politicals, homosexuals, and others indicates to me that they were more severely affected in the end, since true victims are often the ones who don't have a voice (for instance, the genocide of the Native Americans).",0,IAmA,False

&gt;In at least one instance (a 1982 broadcast of the United States Information Agency program Let Poland be Poland about the martial law declared in Poland in 1981), Congress has expressly encouraged PBS to abandon its conventional position of non-partisan neutrality. The program, a protest against the imposition of martial law by a Soviet-backed régime, contained commentary from many well-known celebrities. While widely viewed in the U.S., it met with skepticism on the part of European broadcasters due to concerns that the show, ""provocative and anticommunist,"" was intended as propaganda.

Few months ago, I was discussion with some guy about economics, socialism and capitalism.

I was telling him that some state departments actually hurt the general good, instead of promoting it.

I was telling him how the central bank (the 'Federal Reserve' in the US) was an institution dedicated to help rich, politically connected firms at the expense of the general public.

He was *convinced* I was wrong, and argued tooth and nailed for 30 minutes, coming with all kinds of arguments on why I was wrong (including ""if those laws exist, it must be for a reason!"").

After 30 minutes, something came clear:  He didn't know what a central bank was (he though it was to give loans to the poor).  When I explain what a central bank did, he admitted he didn't even know we had a central bank.

Doesn't matter, he still though I was wrong.

How can you explain that?  People don't have a clue about what they are talking about, but still argue, blindly believing that whatever state institution exist is good, necessary, and we couldn't do without.

This is- in my opinion - almost entirely due to public schooling, which transformed the public opinion over decades from the public being suspicious of government bureaus, to one that believes blindly in the benevolence of the state (although not necessarily about the current administration or politicians, unless they are the right color).

You can take so many example of state institutions and regulations that the average American voter believes are totally dispensable, and show that many industrialized countries do fine without:

US Postal Office -&gt; many European countries gave up state monopoly of mail delivery, including Sweden, England, etc...

In the Muslim world peace is a rare and fragile commodity. There are conflicts that have lasted centuries. Extreme Muslims will blow themselves up to kill an enemy. Women are covered from head to toe in a burqa and the men are well-armed and not happy. 

The US has had two simultaneous wars in the last decade and troops stationed all over the world. The US people are driven to succeed. They take two weeks vacation a year and work eighty hours a week. US women wear bikinis in certain locations in the country. US men are stressed and overworked and not that happy.

Europeans are mostly not at war with anyone and do not have large militaries. Europeans work 38 hours a week and take six weeks vacation or more a year. Europeans seek a balance between work and enjoying life. European women are often naked or topless on beaches, at parks and on TV. European men are laid back and somewhat happy. 

Every decade or so we find a tribe that has had no contact with the outside world roaming around in a rain forest somewhere very remote. The people are happy and friendly and they have no conflicts to speak of. They live in harmony with each other and the land. They have lived this way for centuries.

I wasn't going to add to the thread, as I weighed in heavily to the flame wars on message boards ~4 years ago.  And I didn't want to accidentally come across as flaming you, via the emotionless text medium and in the context of other more pro-propecia comments.  

You're welcome to come here and vent and discuss the problems.  That's fine and likely personally helpful.  You might even find people with similar experiences of varying degrees and find comfort and even coping methods &amp; solutions. 

Proving that, in your case, the drug caused the outcome does little, with all due respect and compassion for your suffering, to the overall cost/benefit of the drug.  I encourage you to, in fact, prove the causation and meet with doctors and maybe even lawyers versed in cases against drug companies.  Find your peace with it.  And to make sure your information gets heard.  Finding many people like you, however, can do much more in the calculus.  It de-emphasizes your personal loss, but is the proper way forward.  

I would be extremely pissed, like you, if the situation was reversed.  As I said, I was 19 when I got on this stuff. And although the doc had reservations, concerns about sexual stuff was not among them.   If the side effect sprung up and impacted my life so heavily in just 30 days without any mention during consult, I would be devastated.  But personal devastation is not a license to fail to give full information to other persons.  It is well known that some people are great responders to fin, while others barely slow their hairloss.  The identification of groups of all sorts of responses can help researchers understand what other pathways are impacted by finasteride's presence and the determinants of response.  And even future treatments.  

I think the Euro warning is a big plus for the information gathering.  As I hopefully made clear, I'm not contending that propecia is fully safe or that your problem ""can't happen."" I hope my ""no-cebo"" cite didn't imply that, as I only meant that there is evidence of a group within 5a-ri recipients who would self-identify as suffering from ED despite not being on fin.  You don't want those people in your sample statistics any more than Merck wants them in their data warning data.  

More importantly, the EU warning has already spurred the big article in the same journal I cited above. [EDIT:here](http://www.bumc.bu.edu/busm-news/2011/01/12/drugs-for-hair-loss-and-benign-prostatic-hyperplasmia-may-result-in-loss-of-libido-erectile-dysfunction-in-men/)  It, by nature of it being on wikipedia, likely mentioned all the time in google-searches on finasteride, etc., will have more people bringing up the question with their GPs, and GPs aware of the possible outcome and to be scanning for it.  But even those studies don't suggest a ban, but rather that a rare side effect is far more serious than originally thought, and can seriously outweigh any benefits, especially cosmetic, in the personal analysis.  

So there may indeed be more than just small exceptions and wider use will reveal that this is a dangerous drug.  But please be aware that many people are on it and doing just fine.  Struggle to be fully objective in your research, even though the outcome of that research has huge impacts on your personally.  You have to be as prepared to discover you are just one of the very unlucky (or hypersensitive) humans to have been exposed to this chemical, as you are prepared to find a significant connection and become the cited author in the Newsweek piece discussing the downfall of Merck.  If you cannot separate yourself from the research, do not do it.  Don't be the next Jenny McCarthy.  Thanks for viewing this all as constructive criticism, and not flaming or lack of compassion.  All the best in your healing.  

But in the future, how about posting something along the lines of ""DAE have permanent negative effects from Propecia"" or ""What are opinions on Finasteride?"" And in the meantime, meet with a ton of doctors and really listen to what they have to say.  ED is incredibly common (more so than just old middle-aged golfers in bad marriages) and has a lot of overlapping causes, from endocrinological to psychological to interpersonal.  There are therefore an equivalent amount of treatments (not just Viagra).  Don't let your research limit your ability to heal (mentally or physically) to whatever extent possible by failing to seek treatment.   ",0,IAmA,False

No it isn't. If I don't hold the door open for you, I don't get ""punished"".

Since when did ""courtesy"" become lawful? o_0

&gt; back in the early 80s there was no such choice for service industry workers or patrons.

I highly doubt that, but if a characteristic of an industry is something you dislike, you might want to choose to work in a different industry.

&gt; and safety precautions exist to mitigate this risk, but it is inherent in the nature of the job. 

Just like smoking can be inherent in nature of working, say, at my restaurant. We can take safety precautions too, like installing ventilation systems.

On one hand, unsafe conditions are okay because *you* perceive them as ""inherent"" to the job. On the other hand, unsafe conditions are not okay because they don't fit your definition as ""inherent.""

&gt; see previous. when there are no choices, this is argument is a false choice.

There is always a choice between using someone else's property or not.

That I don't have the ability to grow wings and fly to Europe is not a limitation of my freedom or my choices.

&gt; because youre essentially saying that your choice to smoke overrides the rights of everyone else around you.

You aren't reading a word I'm writing. This is an issue of *property* rights. If I own property, and I want to smoke on it, I have every right to do so. Otherwise, it isn't my property. Moreover, if it is my property, I may allow others to smoke on it as well.

What you're suggesting is like me coming into your home and ripping out every television in your house because I deem it unhealthy for your mind.

&gt; this is not a fair choice as you are making the decision for others

If I went on to private property that expressly forbids smoking, and I smoked anyway, I would agree that I am in the wrong. I may even be punished for doing so. (Although, I'd just likely be kicked out.)

&gt;further, the long term damage you are inflicting on others has to be managed, either by that person on their own or by society (yes, our current system does that, as distateful as that is). in areas where smoking is allowed, it is generally allowed throughout the premises, and those segregated areas generally present an ineffective barrier. because of the profit motive, business were reticent to prohibit smoking outright, so no actual choice (ie visiting a smoke-free establishment) existed until after mandates were put in place.

I can't really understand this. Are you saying that because businesses don't do what you want, it is okay to mandate them to do so?

If we fixed public awareness of the bad side effects of smoking, and never mandated anything, I somehow doubt establishments wouldn't have banned smoking or taken better measures to segregate areas.

&gt; so your choice to smoke is disproportionately affecting everyone else around you. thats the problem - again, its the same problem as the govt regulation. a choice made by someone else negatively affecting your quality of life without an alternative.

Except you're throwing property rights to the wind, and therefore, the choices are not the same. You perceive them that way, because seemingly, you think being courteous should be a law.

It's very simple. If you don't like a characteristic of an industry or an establishment, and perceive it to be unhealthy for you, then don't work for it and don't visit it. Smoke isn't the only such characteristic.",0,Libertarian,False

The Torries and the Lib Dems locked themselves away from the public and horse-traded the policies we'd voted for in exchange for ministerial cars. How is *that* an improvement in the democratic process?

I'd understand if the party made concessions but stayed true to its principals, its promises to the voters, but then the Lib Dems (arguably the most idealistic of all the parties) showed that even promises carefully worded to be irrespective of an election result, promises signed publicly by each MP, can be traded away for power if the political situation demands it. How is that an improvement of what we have right now?

No, I was disputing your implication in previous posts that the only reason why France has high standards of living but low levels of union membership is because they have government protections.

If a nation can have 70% union rates and still have no mandated minimum wage, then clearly having unions is not vital in getting those laws passed, especially when you can find nations with much weaker unions that both have those laws passed (UK, Germany), and ones that don't (Switzerland).

You can't say ""the only reason France has government protections on workers is because of unions"" when it has only 8% of the population in Unions (and has had among the lowest rates of union membership in Europe for decades), while 2 countries that both have over 70% members in unions have less protections.

If you want to talk about other protections, not only has France got a minimum wage AND collective bargaining for unionised industry, but they have a mandated [35 hour work week](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35-hour_workweek), a piece of law that came into being when Unions where at their weakest for 60 years.

All your arguments amount to [special pleading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading). I bring up France of an example of a nation that has low levels of unionisation and high standards of living, and you say that this says nothing about whether unions are neccesary for high standards of living, because its the Unions that were responsible for enshrining the worker protections.

Which is a weak arguing strategy. Rather than actually having to demonstrate that Unions were responsible for employee law in france, you can merely assert it is so, then you expect me to do the much harder job of disproving a negative.

After all, france has had Unions for over 100 years, and there have been many laws passed on worker regulations, therefore the Unions must be responsible! Prove they're not!

So rather than arguing from correlatory evidence as I am doing, you can just make blanket assertions and then claim intellectual superiority if I don't disprove them to your satisfaction (even though your criteria for satisfaction are extremely vague, while mine are extremely clear).

---------------------------------

I'm gonna make this simple.

[List of nations graphed by Union membership compared to Regulations on Employment Conditions.](http://www.nationmaster.com/plot/lab_tra_uni_mem-labor-trade-union-membership/lab_reg_emp_con-labor-regulation-employment-conditions/flag#details) 

As you can see, there's fuck all meaningful correlation. In fact, nations with lower union membership rates tend to have better regulations. So maybe you say this is because all the countries with strong unions don't need regulation (even though you're claiming its unions that pass the regulations). Okay, whatever.

[Now lets compare it with HDI and Union membership](http://www.nationmaster.com/plot/lab_tra_uni_mem-labor-trade-union-membership/eco_hum_dev_ind-economy-human-development-index/flag)

As you can see again, fuck all correlation between unions and HDI. In fact, if you remove the outliers of France and Norway, there's again a correlation between lower union membership and higher HDI.

In fact, in actuality Norway is only 0.001 points ahead of Australia in the HDI, even though it so it appears much higher on the graph, so their data is a little wonky (or is using out dated data).

If you'd like to use the [wikipedia page for HDI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index) and compare that to a [list of union membership](http://www.worker-participation.eu/National-Industrial-Relations/Across-Europe/Trade-Unions2), I'm sure all the people here who are interested in having their beliefs backed by evidence will thank you.

In fact, if you go one better and compile all the information available, you will have the most concrete answer possible. If you show me this information, I will agree with whatever the correlation is, whether it says Unions are good, bad, or unimportant.

However, considering the lack of interest you've shown in evidence so far, I'm not gonna waste my time tracking down all the information, compiling it just for you to tell me it doesn't matter because of some special pleading bullshit. 

-------------------------------------------------

&gt; When in point of fact, employers are obligated by law to honor minimum wages secured by unions.

There is not a nation in the western world where employers aren't obligated by law to honour contracts they make, this is an irrelevant point.

**If you're not in a industry that has collective bargaining in Finland or Sweden then there is no protection on your wages.** only 90% of Finland and Swedens population are covered in Collective Bargaining agreements. 100% of France and the UK's population is covered by the laws they have, even though they both have much weaker unions.

1. Like entropy said, a few blemishes are easily overcome - just don't make a habit of it. If there is a major dip in your performance (worse than 2 C's, i mean), they'll ask you about it during your interview, so be prepared to explain it when the time comes.

2. Now! Buddy up to a professor this semester and whenever you schedule classes for the fall, just ask him if there's an open spot in his lab. If you make friends with one of your teachers, you won't regret it - I got really close with one of my Bio teachers and he not only wrote me an awesome LOR, but he also became a legitimate friend/mentor. Volunteer - go to your local hospital, find a summer healthcare camp (I worked for a week with kids with Spina Bifida), it doesn't even have to be healthcare related.. you just need to be doing something. 

3. Like Entropy said, your education is what you put into it and you can get a good one anywhere. That being said, the quality of teaching goes US &gt; Caribbean/Europe. Caribbean is way easier to get into (you don't even have to take the MCAT for some), so the quality of student is going to be worse. Plus if you go the foreign education route, you have to take a mess of a test if you're trying to practice in the US. 

4. If you graduate and your GPA is bad, then you can always get a postbac - I may be doing this if I don't get in this cycle.. Join academic honoraries offered by your school - I'm in Beta Beta Beta (bio honorary) and Alpha Epsilon Delta (pre-health honorary). Get involved around campus and be active in student organizations. Shadow, volunteer, and get yo' swag on. That's all you really can do.

Two of those knockout wins came from when Mexico hosted the damn thing (they still couldn't get past the quarters) and the other came when the USA beat fellow CONCACAF squad Mexico! 

It has two decent teams in the USA and Mexico who should be pleased with 2nd round exits based on form.

There isn't a decent 3rd team in the region, much less a 4th. Honduras was a nice story qualifying but they couldn't even score a goal in South Africa.

Basically my gripe with Bieber is that he is marketed well outside the demographic that would typically find him appealing.  He is another manufactured musical persona who's promoted to an obnoxious level.

Why is Bieber being pushed onto the public as though he's palatable by everyone? It's over hype. His promoters are trying too hard and quite frankly that is what makes me angry. It's like someone telling me, ""Here, listen to this kid. He's great you'll like him."" I say he sucks, then the promoters and his fans are like, ""No, really, you just don't get him. Listen he's good."" Then I have to say again no, he really sucks.

I'm sure he's a very nice kid. Actually I have nothing against him personally. I see him and his music as a product. In and of itself there is nothing wrong with the product. I don't like it so I do not purchase that product. It's the way the product is advertised and promoted that I find in poor taste. Of course it doesn't help that I do not like the product.

By poor taste let me use an alternative example. The first time I took a trip to Europe I visited my sister who was working in Warsaw at the time. Old town Warsaw is very nice and is quite beautiful. Unfortunately, one day while I was walking through old town, right in the middle of the square was a huge inflatable Coke bottle and a huge inflatable Ronald McDonald. They were something like two stories tall and were just obnoxious eye sores in an otherwise beautiful setting. For the first time I was ashamed of America and American culture. Apparently no one thought about whether these promotional tools were tasteful and contextually appropriate. That's how I see most of American advertising and culture. It's forced down people's throats whether we like it or not. Bieber's promoters have somehow managed to take this disgusting concept and take it the the next level of absurdity. That in a nut shell is why I hate Justin Bieber.

It's bullshit, the idea that the French are cowards is bullshit, and anyone that knows anything about European military history knows that the French have one of the greatest military histories in the world.

The American revolutionary forces didn't have the weapons or manpower to fight the British.  *Oh but we had guerrilla warfare!*  They had a world-class army, with well trained soldiers, a huge navy, production facilities to fuel the war, and plenty of money to finance it.  If it wasn't for the French supplying training, uniforms, weapons, cannons, ships, etc. we probably would have lost.  Badly.

As for the German invasion of France in 1940, when the supposedly cowardly French armed forces folded under the German Wehrmacht?  France had just recovered from a war where they took nearly 7 million casualties out of a total population of 40 million.  French soldiers spent WWI combating poison gas and charging machine gun nests with bayonets.  I'd like to see anyone call a French soldier circa 1914 a coward.

There was no army in the world that could have held off the Germans in France.  They had a huge land border.  The only reason Britain survived was because they had the Channel.  So the Germans won.  And the French, sensibly, surrendered. 

Ever heard of the Battle of Tours?  Where the Franks well disciplined footmen shrugged off the calvary charge of Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi, and then **killed him**?

The Battle of Austerlitz?  Where 72,000 French fought 85,000 Russians and Austrians and killed or captured 27,000 of them, and lost only 9,000?

Ekartsberg, 1806.  27,000 French reinforcements heading to Napolean at Jena, led under Louis-Nicolas d'Avout aka *The Fuckin' Iron Marshal* ran into the main Prussian forces, including the Prussian King, a Duke, and two Field Marshals.  Not only did the French reinforcements hold off the attack of 55,000 Prussians, but they turned and fought the Prussians until they ran.  
Can you take a guess as to the Prussians or the French won later at Jena?

Do you all realize that the French conquered everything from Moscow to Spain?  Is everyone this ignorant?  People need to learn their history.

&gt; And who are you to say what is ""right""? Social welfare programs improve the livelihood of the bottom 50%. Scandinavian and European countries have virtually eliminated poverty by providing for everyone. Pensions, government healthcare, unemployment benefits, and a variety of other safety nets have ensured the incredible fruits of technological advancement are enjoyed by everyone- not just the upper 10%.

Here, all you did was claim a bunch of things. You point out that theese countries have less poverty now then before and say we have social programs now so that is the reason. Correlation does not equal causation, you need logic to back up your claims otherwise it is worthless.

&gt; These countries use mixed economies, with state control of certain industries such as energy, and tight regulation of other industries, to combat the inherent consolidation and bottom-feeding tendencies of pure capitalist markets. And they've worked very well, as opposed to the US where outside of finance our GDP has actually been shrinking the last 10 years.

Do you really think that the US is a free market? How could you possibly look at the US that has over $13 trillion dollars in debt and over $100 trillion in unfunded liabilities and say ""Oh yea thats the free market in action there"".

Barack Obama's health care bill requires you to buy healthcare insurance just by the fact that you are alive, is that the free market part of the US you are talking about?

Another area where you fall apart is if you look at the two freest economies on earth (Hong Kong and Singapore) and they are leaders of economic growth and have been eliminating poverty at a constant rate.

There are several social constructs and political threats to women that you seem to be glossing over. In several respects, gender conditioning (gender roles/objectification and hyper-sexualization of women in the media) and biological sex (men proposing laws to jail women for miscarrying/men making decisions on women's health) make the gap of privilege men are conditioned with, and born into, undeniable.

Jesus, even today spousal rape is only considered rape if it's forcible, and in places like Ohio and Kansas a husband cannot be charged with sexual battery against his wife. These are living testaments to a male-run society's view of women.

Women are excelling because we've fought tooth and nail for generations to prove ourselves, and we're taking full advantage of finally having the chance to live our own lives. 

Of course this is confusing for younger generations whose parents are clinging to a different set of values, and I have faith that things will eventually even out for young men and women. After all, men still have *access* to high-paying jobs and higher education, but they aren't *getting* the higher educations necessary for higher-paying jobs. (The reasons behind this are for a different thread.)

I want this to sink in for a second. Women weren't formally allowed to study at Universities until 1868 in the US..1876 for Great Britain.  We've had about 140 years of access to higher education, though I use the term ""access"" loosely because of certain restrictions. Great, right? Yes, it was, but then Radcliff wasn't fully dissolved until **1999**.. meaning female undergrads at Radcliff weren't the full responsibility of Harvard until 12 years ago. It took nearly *40 years* of slowly integrating changes for this to happen. If that doesn't make you step back for a second, think of it this way: only in the past few decades have women finally earned truly equal access to the highest educational institutions--something men have *always* had. So this:

&gt;There is no other class of person in history more privileged than the young educated western heterosexual white woman.

is foolish, to put it mildly. Educated heterosexual white *men* have carried the torch of privilege for *centuries*. 

Look back to Rome. Even slaves could earn their freedom and become citizens; common women were born property and were never granted full citizenship. The branches of Rome spread throughout Western Europe, and those societies flourished in the shadow of Roman social doctrine while seeds of their own germinated discriminations unique to the stem of the next civilization to take hold. 

You seem to be turning away from very basic truths to support a fallacious view of reality wherein women are on top of the world and men are buried somewhere under the crust. This is simply not true.

*They're basically addicted to the sport. Since they spend a lot of time traveling to matches the relationships they built up before they started playing professionally suffer. I doubt communication via skype/msn is enough to maintain healthy relationships with your old friends/family etc.

*The ones living in Europe are in the worst situation. They are very limited to the people who they can socialize with since they do not understand the language and Europeans aren't that great at speaking English. Life must be rly boring for them after they pass the initial phase of excitement of living in Europe.

*As I said, since they spend so much time thinking about the sport, how much common topics would they even have with other people with ""normal"" jobs/lives (jobs that don't take over your entire life like Tennis imo does). Do they even have time to watch new movies/listen to new music releases (listening to music while not playing the game)? I think they most of them would be pretty boring to talk to about anything non-Tennis related.

*One last thing. What after they stop their tennis careers? When they settle down in a certain town. When their tennisfriends all come back to their own towns/countries and stop playing. I doubt Federir is gonna socialize with his Swiss friends regularly when he gets in his 40s, he's gonna be far away in the U.K. and all the other guys are gonna live in their native countries. If these professional tennis players don't maintain their old pre-professional career friends I fear they will feel very alone when they get older and stop playing.

For international travel, if you get a bulkhead seat you can request a bassinet where he can sleep. These are in limited supply, from what I hear, and you can only request it once at the airport. So, you may want to be sure to get to the gate early to request it. It also might worthwhile to check with the airline in advance to see if they, by any chance, can ensure that one will be provided for you. Different airlines may have different procedures for this kind of thing. If they *don't* have a bassinet, then I would think you would want to avoid a bulkhead seat for two reasons: First, you can't have your bags in front of you under the seat. They have to go overhead. Second, the seats have the tray in the armrest, so if you have more than one seat reserved, you won't be able to raise the armrest to make more room -- or to block off the space between the seats when you're nursing so you don't give the person behind you a show. If the flight is not full, see if you can get a row of empty seats. For families the best choice can be the very last row of seats, if you can have several seats to yourself. These seats don't recline, so they're not really attractive to most passengers, but it's nice if you can get enough seats to be able to let your baby lie down across them to sleep and for diaper changes without having to go in the lavatory. Plus, often the rear of the plane is noisy, and that will drown out any noises your baby makes.

Take your medical supplies in your carry on. Acetaminophen, ibuprofen (take both so you can alternate every 3 hours per Dr Sears' method if needed), gas drops, ointments, etc. You'll have to put the liquid stuff in a ziplock for security.

You'll want to limit carryons to just essentials. Take a backpack as a diaper bag. Hands free. Inside the backpack, have a smaller pouch with the basic supplies you need for a changing: changing mat, a few diapers, creams, wipes, sanitizer, etc... If this can be put on your shoulder that will help. Take this with you into the lavatory for changings.

Don't forget to have a change of clothes packed for you and the baby. For how long you'll be traveling you may want a couple of changes for the baby. I usually keep separate top and bottom packed (vs. a one-piece outfit) so that I can just change the top or just change the bottom if only one or the other gets soiled.

My Brest Friend makes an inflatable nursing pillow for traveling, if you find nursing with a MBF helpful. It can be nice to have on flights as a surface for your baby to rest on or sit on, assuming you don't have a giant, 23 lb 6-month-old like I do. :)

Another handy thing to have is a good nursing shirt. I find it uncomfortable to nurse with a cover a lot of times, so a nursing shirt lets me feed the baby discreetly without a cover. That said, I still carry the cover in case I need to remove distractions from my baby's field of view or if there's someone nearby who I can tell would be uncomfortable with me nursing without.

It can be difficult to try and time flights to be most compatible with naptimes/bedtimes -- especially when crossing time zones. But it's something to consider. Be prepared, though, for all your hard work to go out the window when there are delays. :/ This has happened to us often.

Are you traveling with someone? Be sure to try and get seats all together. If you can't when booking, arrive to the gate early, and the gate agents will work magic to help you out.

Consider buying a day pass to your airline's swanky lounge. This will enable you to chill with your baby in a quiet, less stimulating place in between flights -- and if you need any special accommodation (a bassinet, the earth moved to wrangle seats together, etc) the angels who work at the counter at the lounge can take care of that for you. They are used to ensuring that premium passengers are taken care of, and they have better strings they can pull sometimes.

Regarding nursing on the flight, I do it every takeoff and landing. Really the only folks who can see are maybe the people across the aisle from you -- and they'd have to turn and look right at you to see anything interesting. Don't worry about it. Take care of your baby. I usually do travel with a couple of ounces of pumped milk just in case I need another option to nursing. Sometimes my guy gets distracted, or if it's close to naptime he can be fidgety and not want to settle down to nurse. If your baby can take a pacifier, have that handy, too, as well as some teething toys. Anything that'll get the jaw moving. Swallowing is best, but chewing is better than nothing. I usually try to keep him nursing/sucking/chewing until my ears are no longer popping. If you have a layover somewhere, you might need to feed him a little early to ensure you get the timing right for him to be getting hungry during takeoff for your next flight. That's the type of thing to consider to time takeoff/landing nursing. (Just cross your fingers that they don't do a last minute delay!)

We got the megabucket for our kid (The Snugride 35 -- it has a 35 lb weight limit) so that we can still bucketize him when we travel. We have a snap-n-go stroller for the airport that we can gate check. But we always have bought him a seat. If he's a lap child, and there are no spare seats available for him toting a car seat may be a hassle. In our case, it works great, because our baby is used to taking naps in his bucket. If you're walking around Europe, you will probably want a stroller more robust than the snap-n-go, but the bucket still may be able to snap into it. You can gate check the stroller, so it's right there for you when you exit the plane.

We have the [Snugglider](http://www.amazon.com/Graco-SnugGlider-Swing-SnugRide-Infant/dp/B000M4K4BY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=baby-products&amp;qid=1299019094&amp;sr=8-1), a swing apparatus that the bucket snaps into, and he naps while swinging in it a lot at home and on the road. The swing easily disassembles and reassembles, so it's great to take along traveling. So keeping him in the bucket on the plane is a natural way for him to be able to sleep. 

Another gadget we take with us when traveling is an exercise ball. We inflate it upon arrival at our destination, and we use it to soothe the baby to sleep if he wakes in the night -- or to lull him to sleep for naps. We just hold him in a cradle hold while sitting on the ball bouncing up and down. It works like rocking, but it's portable.

We also take an inflatable tub to make baths easier. I bring along a hooded towel and some of his washcloths, too.

We have stayed in hotel rooms, corporate apartments and with relatives when traveling. By far the easiest option was the corporate apartment. A hotel room was the most difficult. If you can find an apartment or a vacation rental that has a washing machine and a separate bedroom you will be living large. You'll be able to hang out post-bedtime in your own space where you can turn the lights on, have a conversation, watch TV, whatever, while the baby sleeps. We pack our video monitor so that we can keep tabs on the baby. A washer will enable you to bring fewer clothes (and blankets, bibs, burp cloths, etc...). You might want to bring along your own detergent. VRBO.com and Homeaway.com have good rental listings.

We cosleep and have found that it's easy for the baby to adapt to sleeping wherever we happen to be. If you use a crib, you might like the Baby Bjorn Travel Crib Light for your trip if you need to bring something. It sets up in literally seconds. It's expensive, but it's superlightweight and easy to check. I can see why it gets such good reviews.

WRT breastfeeding in Europe, I don't have experience yet first-hand, but I have heard that it's easier to nurse in public there than in the US.

You may also find a carrier useful. An Ergo or something like it would probably do the trick. We recently took a trip where we were getting on and off small boats, and the Ergo was handy to keep the baby secure while doing this.

Another thing to consider is if your son will be eating solids by the time you are traveling and how you want to handle that. One option might be to bring along some [freeze-dried babyfood](http://www.nurturme.com/). I have seen it available in Whole Foods. You mix a packet of it with water or breastmilk to reconstitute it.

Diapers can be tricky. You can fit a surprising amount in the outer zipper compartments of your luggage and in all the nooks and crannies inside. Or you can bring a bag containing diapers that will hold souvenirs on the way home. Spare diapers make excellent packaging material for anything fragile. 

That's about all I can think of atm. Enjoy your adventure -- and take a ton of pictures for family and friends.",0,Mommit,False

A large amount of banking is done online and all banking transactions can be performed using your banks online interface - and I mean absolutely everything, up to and including getting a mortgage, applying for new accounts and even switching banks completely. There is never a need to have physical bank branches at all - my UK bank is entirely online and I hadn't needed to go to a bank branch in 5+ years, before I moved to Canada.

People's mental model of banks imagines that on some level banks are big vaults with gold in, and that transactions involve physical movement - this has not been the case for a *very* long time and almost all banking operations are entirely digital and automated on the banks side.

Money can also be transferred, via the IBAN system, from any bank account in Europe, to any other, instantly and without charge.

And it's often the orthodox, little ""o"", which are growing. (I use that word to mean ""maintaining traditional Christian values"" such as the resurrection of Christ, authority of scriptures, etc. to include Christians who may not consider themselves ""evangelical"") 

[2008 PEW Survey of religion](http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report2-religious-landscape-study-full.pdf) indicates Mainline (usually more liberal) churches are declining while Protestant Churches are generally younger, have more members and are more involved with congregational activities-- second only to historically black churches.

[This is a recurring trend in mainline churches.](http://au.christiantoday.com/article/decline-in-us-mainline-denominations-continues/7647.htm)

Tim Keller references this in an [interview](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/article_print.html?id=56002) (I saw you comment on another article about him, so I thought if you wanted more I'd give you an excerpt)
&gt;The recent Pew study talked about changing patterns of belief in America. Has that affected your apologetics ministry?
The Pew study showed that the moderate middle has atrophied — people who are kind of Christian. They now take Christianity metaphorically. They believe the Resurrection is a wonderful symbol. That group has just been shrinking, and secularism and orthodoxy are growing. So we have a polarized society — which is what I try to say in the first chapter of the book. So it only confirmed the book.
One reason for this is because I think there's been a backlash. Evangelicalism has been so identified with conservative Republican values that a lot of people who might be more moderate have decided they are not religious. I've seen that happen in New York. They're moderate or liberal politically, and they feel like orthodox Christianity is so identified with conservative Republican politics that they have actually distanced themselves from the faith.

Secularism and atheism ARE growing but so is Christianity. What is happening is the middle is shrinking. The churches you claim are ""holding on"" which shy away from claims of absolute truth are so secular that their entire theology seems to be superfluous. Why be a part of this Church when they believe what anyone else does on the outside? Be a good person, love your neighbor? Forgiveness OK. Cool. Got it, not need for Church now. Peace.

Christianity isn't just about the parts we like to hear in our culture. It's about a transformation from God through the incarnation of Jesus Christ.

I respect we have different views but I would suggest that not all orthodox or evangelical Christians are ""ignorant"". There are very well educated people who believe in the authority of scripture and that Christ rose from the dead, died for our sins and is our only hope for salvation. Their views are not rigid and holding to them does not mean it is impossible for them to love their neighbor or put an emphasis on community.

Sometimes, people who preach open-mindedness can be just a close-minded as the people they decry if not more so.

All that said, it is NOT an excuse for abhorrent behavior from ""Conservative Christians"". I am ashamed and I apologize on behalf of my fellow believers.

(Note: I focus mainly on American Churches but Christianity is rapidly growing in Asia and Africa and South America. I kind of neglected that point though. Got to go, sorry).

Israel doesn't have the capability to bomb Iran effectively - it's too far away.  Even the Osirak reactor was at the very edge of their capability.  They have a handful of F-15s that can make the trip and some conventional IRBMs.  They could probably destroy the reactor, but they wouldn't be able to destroy the uranium enrichment program, so they'd only be buying a few months at the cost of a full-scale war.  Even then it could only be done with permission to use Iraq's airspace, something I doubt would be forthcoming.

&gt;The least credible part of all this is your suggestion that Iran would make an overt move towards weapons -- such as removing spent fuel from IAEA control (which violates the parts of the NPT they actually signed -- something they have not done before (at least publicly)). 

Do you really think they fear attack?  Really?  Let me tell you how it would go:  US and Europeans express outrage (outrage!).  After six months of talks (during which reprocessing takes place) Iran agrees to halt reprocessing the (partially) spent fuel if the west agrees to provide two more nuclear reactors.  The west agrees.  Six months later the Iranians say the reactors aren't getting built fast enough and restart their reprocessing operation.  More outrage.   After six months of talks (during which time reprocessing takes place) Iran agrees to stop reprocessing if the west provides magic unicorns and free big-gulp slurpies to the Iranian parliament.  Three months later they restart processing because the slurpies are melted and hey, those are just horses!  After six months of talks the Iranians announce they've built ten warheads and intend to nuke anyone who attacks them.

They're not stupid.  They know how the North Koreans did it.

&gt;The heck? It's far more expensive than nuclear. The fuel cost alone would be 20 c/kWh!

Perfect, we can support their revolution, and prevent our rival from becoming more powerful.

So, basically you think that because the French weren't idiots, that they were idiots.  Derrp.

Seriously, don't you get this creeping sensation of cognitive dissonance?  You said that the French shouldn't get credit for the Revolutionary War because they spent alot of money to fight the British, their rival, and not because they cared about the Revolution.  Of course they cared!  If they didn't care, they wouldn't have done anything!  Their reasons for caring were of course different than the reasons that the revolutionaries had.  As far as the French were concerned, it was a civil war, Brits fighting Brits.  Only if they helped, they could have the Brits in America like them, and it would prevent the Brits in England from having too much power.

By 1803, when the Louisiana Purchase occurred, France had been fighting for many years in Italy.  Crossing the Alps and such.  Ring a bell?  They were weakened, and busy with shit in Europe.  They didn't have time to worry about their claims in America.  They needed to get their shit together in Europe.  The Americans knew this, and used it to get a pretty quick, cheap sale of a huge amount of land.  Who else was France going to sell that land to?  The English?

You ask to cite something to prove you wrong... You're not.  You're absolutely right.  France did those things to stick it to the English... duh.  Every country looks out for itself.

And if you think the Marshall Plan was more about helping out our buddies than about setting up economies that would be favorable to the American trade and lifestyle, you're wrong.  At the time, it was thought that countries like France or Italy would turn to communism.  Giving Europe money allowed not only for regrowth, but for *influence*.  Much more important.  It's why we were outraged when much of Europe wasn't very supportive of the US's actions in the Middle East.  Seriously, pouring wine in the streets, calling them Freedom Fries... that was ridiculous.  But pretty much since we gave them money, Western Europe became our bitch.  They put policies into place that were heavily influenced by America (War on Drugs anyone?) because we were.  And now that they're back on their feet, they're kind of getting annoyed at the surprise when they don't necessarily agree with us.

Remember though, that Hobbes calls for judges, although he calls them arbitrators. The arbitrators are supposed to settle disputes and were instituted by the sovereign. In Hobbes' account we have no property rights, but we can still have covenants, or contracts which need to be enforced by legitimate judges

I just disagree that Locke needed property to get the social contract. Some context might help make my point. 

Filmer argued that political legitimacy was not gained through consent (contra Hobbes) but rather was bestowed on Adam by god and passed to his descendents along patriarchal lines. Adam had sovereignty over his progeny and political power was passed down eventually making its way to the kings of Europe. This view is known as the divine right of kings. It actually defends the kingly power of the English sovereigns by tracing their lineal descent directly from Adam, Noah, or one of the ""seventy-two father- kings who were raised up at Babel.""  It is peculiar in the respect that the absolute power of the sovereign explains patriarchal supremacy, and the subjugation of women.  

In the first treatise on government, Locke refutes Filmer’s argument for the divine right of kings and in the second treatise tries to legitimize the glorious revolution which overthrew James II. Locke explains that all men are created equal and political coercion is only legitimated by consent. By reasoning from the social contract, Locke argues that the only thing that can ground legitimate political power is consent, and tyrants can be thrown out because they come to forfeit this consent. Notice that property plays no role at all here.

Main role of government is to provide defense for its citizenry.

Except nearly every other first world country on earth besides the US has extremely low levels of religiosity, and atheists are the fastest growing demographic in the US. Hell you can even look at polls *in the US*, religiosity is directly correlated with lower levels of education. The higher your education and level of scientific literacy the less likely you are the believe in god. So that pathetic counter-example is bunk.

On direct current (DC), electrons move in a orderly fashion from the positive pole to the negative pole of the electric generator. Nothing to see here, move along. All bateries (automotive, AA, etc) provide direct current.

Alternating current (AC) is what you get from your wall outlet. The electrons move forward, then backward and so on. That cycle is repeated 60 times per second (50 times per second on Europe), which gives the famous 60hz frequency.

That may sound silly at first (why go forward then backward?), but AC has a ton of advantages over DC. Firstly, when electrical energy is generated by a turning machine (wind turbines, hydroelectric turbines, etc) it is already AC. By using transformers, AC can easily have its voltage elevated. That makes it much easier to be carried over long distances, as much thinner cables can be used to transfer the same amount of power.

Most electronic equipments use DC. But rectification (turning AC to DC) is a trivial and cheap process. In fact, it's cheaper for each and every equipment that needs DC to have its own internal rectifier than to transmit DC from the power plant.

What makes AC dangerous is exactly the fact that it... well, alternates. If a current as small as 1mA at 60hz goes through the heart (i.e. from one arm to another) there's a high risk that this electrical discharge can mess with the electrical pulses that makes the heart beat.",0,IWantToLearn,False

What to do..

Well, we can always start by reading this:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_atheism

It's an instructing read. In particular, its documented data points are directly at odds with your dogmatic claim that atheists are the majority in most European countries. Specifically, check the ""Eurobarometer Poll 2005"" (which links to http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf for its source.)

&gt; According to the most recent relevant Eurostat Eurobarometer poll, in 2005, 52% of European Union citizens responded that ""they believe there is a God"", whereas 27% answered that ""they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force"" and 18% that ""they do not believe there is a spirit, God, nor life force"".

I'm assuming you won't try to claim the believers in some sort of spirit of life force as Atheists, of course.

So that leaves my pathetic counter-example. Speaking of which, the other thing that's quite annoying in your response is the lack of effort you made to conceal that you did not bother reading the very comment you took the time to reply to.

Compare your ""The higher your education and level of scientific literacy the less likely you are the believe in god"" with my ""Is it because our individual level of scientific knowledge is overall quite low, leaving room for mysticism to fill the gaps? Maybe. The USA example could certainly be used to support that argument.""

Are we not effectively arguing the same point? Unfortunately, you took offense a few lines higher in my comment, and apparently skipped a bit until you found something else that could offend you again.

As to the pathetic counter-example itself, there's really nothing to defend. the USA is factually combining high technological levels and high religiosity. To deny that is to deny reality, no matter how unpleasant you may find it.

I'll close this comment with one thought: Atheism hasn't historically been well tolerated in many societies. In fact, even today, there is a stigma in many cultures with declaring oneself to be an Atheist. As such, is it not possible that the amount of Atheists may not have significantly grown over time, but that instead, Atheists have felt more safe to come out?

If that's the case, how much of the growth you claim would merely be coming from Atheists that merely felt safe enough to stop pretending to believe?

we may well have to wait a bit longer to get better trends, but I wouldn't be surprised if we found out that the total number of Atheists is ultimately staying rather flat, with the rest of us still desperately looking for answers in something that transcends us.

The 777 matches the KC-10 extremely well in size and capability, and is ridiculously fuel efficient and reliable. The 777 has no real competitors out there, and when it came out it pretty much killed the A340, the next-best airplane of that size. In any competition of ""777 versus something else"", I can't see the 777 losing. Also, I don't think Airbus even makes freighter A340s, which means that development of an A340 tanker would be expensive, while developing a 777 tanker from the 777 freighter would be relatively straightforward.

And none of that is true of the 767 versus the A330. The A330 is a better airplane by most counts - a little bigger, a little more efficient (in terms of cost PER how much it carries, not absolute cost), a little more reliable, and not really much more expensive. 767 sales dropped quite a bit when the A330 came out and never quite recovered. An honest Boeing person will admit that the A330 is a better airplane overall. The only good reason for not picking the A330 for KC-X is that it's significantly bigger than the airplane it would be replacing.

So KC-X was quite competitive: The slightly cheaper American plane versus the slightly better European airplane. But I can't imagine Airbus concocting a better KC-10 replacement than the 777 would be.",0,Seattle,False

For example, Old Japanese had the word *pyitö* (pronounced pretty much like ""pita""; IPA [pitə]) for 'person.' Over time, it started changing shape. Middle Japanese saw all the ""P""s become ""F""s, and the vowels were simplified, down from 7 (plus one [diphthong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphthong)) to 5 (with no diphthongs). Thus *pyitö* became *fito* (pronounced like fee-toe; IPA [ɸito]). Modern Japanese further changed the word's shape, with almost all ""F""s becoming ""H""s (though the situation is a bit more complex than that). Thus, *fito* is now *hito* (sort of pronounced like he-toe; IPA [çito]).

Sound change is one way in which we can reconstruct which languages are related, and how they have changed over time. This reconstruction is done through the Comparative Method. Before I get into that, let's digress a bit to Indo-European.

Indo-European is the ""oldest"" language family. By that, I don't mean that it has been around for longer than other language families, but that its relationships were discovered first. For a long time, people had noticed that Classical Latin, Ancient Greek, and Sanskrit were all very similar to one another. For example, modern English *nine* (or even better Old English *nigon*), Latin *novem*, and Sanskrit *nava* all look--and more importantly, sound similar. Not only do they sound similar, you can start building up an idea of a source language from which they all came.

So how does the Comparative Method work? First, you must gather a set of proposed cognates (cognates being words which have the same source). Then, you must discount things like chance or borrowing. An example of a chance correspondence would be [Kaqchikel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaqchikel_language) (a Mayan langauge) *mes*, meaning 'mess'; and English *mess*, also meaning 'mess'. The languages and words aren't related; they just so happen to have ended up sounding fairly similar. You also want to rule out borrowing. For example, Japanese has the word *tonakai* ('reindeer'), and Ainu has *tonakay* ('reindeer')--identical words. Japanese, however, borrowed this word from Ainu. There are no reindeer in any part of Japan. Indeed, the Ainu too, also living in Japan, borrowed the word from the Nivx who *do* live near reindeer, who nowadays have the word *tlangi* for 'reindeer' (but at one point had a word like *tulankai*).

Once you have ruled out chance and borrowing, you start to build up recurrent sound correspondences. ""Recurrent"" meaning that, for example, if you say you have a sound change ""P""s becoming ""F""s, you always have that change. You don't just get to say, ""Well, these ""P""s went to ""B""s"" without some good evidence or rules.

This was done first for Indo-European. It started with the three major classical languages (Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit), and moved outwards. Nowadays, we include such strange and interesting languages as Hittie (the oldest to split from proto-Indo-European), Tocharian A &amp; B (the second oldest to split, and the most geographically remote, having been spoken in [Xinjiang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang), China). 

There are two major theories about who spoke proto-Indo-European. One is the [Kurgan hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurgan_hypothesis), which puts the speakers on the steppes north of the Caucasus Mountains around 6,000 years before present. The other, the [Anatolian hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolian_hypothesis), puts the speakers in central Turkey around 9,000 BP.

Afro-Asiatic, at least in part, was known far back as well. However, there is much less consensus about how it subgroups or where and when Proto-Afro-Asiatic was spoken. The most widely accepted hypothesis is in the Horn of Africa, specifically Ethiopia, at least 4800 BP (when Afro-Asiatic languages were first attested in writing).

Note that I study East Asian languages, so I'm not really an expert on either of these other families. If you want to know more about this, let me know.",0,linguistics,False

Here is my hypothesis: The US (and allies) want Libya's oil. Their plan to get it is: Stage a revolt in Libya ... call in mercenaries to massacre Gaddafi's own people... use the media to exaggerate reports of violence against civilians by Gaddafi's troops... under the guise of humanitarian intervention, send in their military to occupy Libya and secure her oil reserves.


Supporting evidence I have amassed for this hypothesis so far:

1. Libya's proven oil reserves are the largest in Africa - making it a prime target for a false flag event as described in my hypothesis.

2. Libyan's quality of life is among the highest in Africa (free healthcare, access to clean water, age expectancy of over 70, poverty rate of under 8%) - which would indicate that riots are not particularly as likely as Egypt, where there is genuine poverty.

3. [There are first hand reports from Libya and Bahrain](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ft9vv/this_is_going_to_sound_insane_but_i_think_america/) that our media is not telling us the truth about the protests (scroll down a little to see the one from Bahrain).

4. The UN Security Council [""granted broad immunity from war crimes prosecution for the mercenaries responsible for many of the bloodiest massacres against the pro-democracy protesters""](http://news.antiwar.com/2011/02/27/us-measure-ensures-gadhafi-mercs-immune-from-war-crimes-prosecution/) - which was at the US' request. This could indicate that the US is planning to send, or has already sent, mercenaries to Libya.

5. Gaddafi has support in Libya from many Libyans; something the media barely, and grudgingly report. See [here](http://www.reuters.com/news/video?videoId=190592397&amp;feedType=VideoRSS&amp;feedName=TopNews&amp;videoChannel=1&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+reuters/USVideoTopNews+) and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebA6qUoH2h4).

6. [The US and EU are planning](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-27/qaddafi-asset-freeze-approved-by-un-as-rebels-declare-provisional-regime.html) sanctions against Libya and the freezing of Gaddafi's assets. [There is even a report that the US already has troops in Libya](http://www.prisonplanet.com/report-us-special-forces-arrive-in-libya.html). An invasion by the US (and allies) is looking likely.

7. I'm not the only one who is suspicious. Two world leaders are speaking out - see [here](http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/03/01/libya.venezuela.chavez/index.html?hpt=T2) and [here](http://www.rferl.org/content/article/2324460.html)... And [from a politician in Bahrain](http://en.rian.ru/world/20110224/162745211.html).

8. The US has done this before, in Iraq, except that time the lie was WMDs. In that instance, the media was thoroughly compliant, and many civilians were completely fooled. Since that time, not many people have gotten much smarter. The same people who were fooled before can be fooled again.

Yes, given the social conditions and the decisions of individuals in Europe that was the outcome. In Japan however all sides chose to give up gun powder weapons as the availably of the weapons threatened the social order. History can take many paths. In fact the nations of Europe made agreements that they would not sell machine guns to Africa, allowing European nations free reign to colonize the African continent (I couldn't find a source on this). Under those conditions the invention of the machine gun did not offer positive change to the Africans. Control of technology presents a serious serious risk to technology as a liberating agent.

In the same way, the invention and use of UAVs is not an empowering technology to individual humans but rather empowers large collective entities the ability to carry out large scale/low risk assassination campaigns. A similar case can be made for ICBMs as agents of centralization, since only large powers have the wealth and resources to manufacture and field them. In fact, the social realities of the USG as a dominant power have prevented smaller countries from developing self-sufficient rocket programs (various companies that attempted to build economies of scale comodities rocket programs were outlawed and forced out of business by the USG under the concern that such technologies would erode the USG advantage as one of two ICBM manufacturers).

&gt;I believe that you are being naive. Such a treatment in a country with universal healthcare would (in your scenario) bankrupt the nation long before the entire nation could benefit, which would likely result in riots.

Agreed, but socialism and altruism is far more and less than the government. There no reason that such efforts such be centrally controlled, funded or set up. When you help someone by the side of the road you aren't asking the government for anything, but yet you as an individual are providing a social service to another individual. We as individuals need to solve these problems outside of government, moving behind government doesn't mean there aren't solutions. 

Government, industry, and culture can change the way technology is used and accepting this fact we need to influence government, companies and culture to make sure that each new technology provides the most benefits and the fewest risks. This doesn't mean legislation in terms of outlawing technology, this means legislation in terms of making it a right to own, modify and play with this technology (repealing gun control laws for example). When legislation fails, as it often does, we need find ways to circumvent systems of control (pirate radio, or piratesbay.org for example). 

&gt;I would also prefer the altruistic freedom-loving people. Do let me know if you ever encounter a breeding pair.

The traditional term for such people is anarchist or libertarian-socialist (they used to be called libertarian until 1976 when the libertarian party USA was formed on more right wing principals).

For starters, the weather in Santiago is almost identical to San Francisco, possibly a little bit colder in the winter. Don't think you'll be coming to a tropical paradise because you'll be disappointed. It is certainly a lot warmer than Northern Europe and rarely (once every 5-6 years or so) snows in the city.

Let me give you a little background about myself so you can gauge what I'm saying and judge for yourself how my experience may relate to you. I'm a tri-citizen (Chile, USA, Germany) so I'm not 100% sure how immigration would go for you or what procedures you would need to follow to get yourself legal here. A standard tourist visa is good for 90 days, and I know a few people that make visa runs to Argentina every three months (4 hour bus ride away). You don't want to fuck around with the visas; I had a friend who overstayed his tourist visa by about two months and now he can't come back to Chile. Being Chilean, I already spoke Spanish, so this also facilitated things for me a lot. 

When you first get here, you will probably have to teach English for a year or two until your Spanish improves enough to be able to get yourself a job. Start looking into the TEFL certification now. You can make enough to pay the bills, but don't expect to live lavishly. 

Once your Spanish improves enough, you can start looking for a ""real"" job. Being European (or US in my case) educated gives you a HUGE leg up, especially if you have some relevant work experience in your field of choice. Americans and Western Europeans generally have a reputation for being professional and working their asses off. In my experience, this is a well deserved reputation when you compare Western performance with Chilean performance; keep in mind this isn't always the case but is very generally speaking. 

As for technology and start ups, I think that Chile has a huge future here. Every other student you speak to is studying to become some sort of engineer or computer scientist. However, there is a huge deficit of people studying administration and entrepreneurship. If you can combine the technological skills with business savy, experience, drive and professionalism, you will be in an excellent position here.  

I came down here within a year after getting my BA from a top US school. I also had my own business that I ran while in school which I sold for a nice sum of money. I got a job here that pays about USD$2,500 per month. That may not sound like a lot, but I'm living in a 3 bedroom apartment in a brand-new, high-rise apartment building in a very nice, safe neighbourhood and the WHOLE APARTMENT costs USD$480 per month. With roommates, you can imagine how fucking cheap that is. 

Santiago also has, in my opinion, the best public transportation system in the world (that includes Europe). I can get anywhere in the city within an hour for about USD$1. That's not an exaggeration.

With things being so cheap here, I'm sure you can imagine the quality of life I am able to live. 

Chile is also the safest, wealthiest (distribution-wise) and least corrupt country in Latin America. equality in the distribution of wealth is improving very quickly. Santiago is safer than London, and less corrupt than many Western countries.

It's a beautiful country, and I love it here. I'd be happy to answer any other questions you might have.",0,windowshots,False

If you're anywhere in New England, he can point you toward someone who'll do a conversion without raising any eyebrows or lecturing or sneering.

Actually, if you're anywhere in New England, *I* can do that so PM me.

If you're not, you should still try to find a local luthier.

Buying a violin is like buying a car -- there are great bargains out there, the equivalent of a good solid used Corolla with 100K miles and a dent in the door, but recently replaced brakes/adjusted timing belt -- it'll run just fine for years yet. But: if you don't notice signs like that weird pull in the front end that means it's been in an accident, or the exhaust plume that means it drinks oil, you can end up with something that needs more repair than it's worth. And new shiny catalog violins from China can be GREAT (they are kicking Europe's butt these days) but they can also be bright shiny pieces of whiny crud.

This is one of the times when it really makes sense to go to someone who does this for a living. Luthiers (violin dealers/repairers), the solo-outfit guys, not the big sparkly showrooms, tend to be some of the sweetest, most helpful guys you'll meet. There aren't many super-rich luthiers, so they're usually doing it out of love. They love to work with wood, to take something damaged and heal it, to matchmake a player with an instrument. The big showrooms are often very warm as well, as long as YOU're not intimidated by the hushed carpeting and five-digit top end instruments.

Anything you buy will need to be ""set up"" -- the bridge feet fitted to the top, the soundpost placed, good strings put on. This has to be done by a luthier, so anything you buy through a catalog will have to go to someone human, so why not just start there? And if you do buy from a catalog, you'll need to take it in to have it swapped anyway -- and craftsmen would rather work on one of their own ""children"" any day.

Do you truly live in the middle of nowhere? Do you really want a new shiny one? Is fresh-off-the-shelf important to you? If it is, look at the Eastman line from any of the big catalogues, or check on your local Craigslist for someone upgrading -- although anyone with anything good has probably already consigned it to the local luthier, so it all just comes around.


What does your teacher have to say about all of this? Doesn't s/he have a loaner you can use to get started, until you actually know what kind of sound you like? Can't they recommend a local rental agency? Or won't the rental folk reverse it?


and finally (I'm writing a novel, sorry, but this stuff is right up my alley), how does your CP affect your left hand? Loss of accuracy, strength, slowed reaction, tremors, what? I've got people in my circle playing with post-stroke issues, Parkinson's, busted rotator cuffs, no right hand to begin with (congenital), all sorts of issues, and the various adaptations have been fascinating to work out -- and problems don't always take the form you expect.

Would having a bigger head on the tuning pegs help you grip? Are you better off getting a Wittner tailpiece with integrated fine tuners on all strings, or is fine-motor an issue?

(Honestly, the more I think about all of the violin guys I know, the more I'm sure most of them would LOVE to help you out. Fitting a violin with the right chinrest/shoulderrest is a lot like fitting prosthetics already, and it's a process many guys enjoy. Once in a while you find a luthier who's more of a hermit, wants to live in his shop and work with his hands and is uncomfortable with people, but most really dig the problemsolving.)

Given all of those variations, ""antisemitism"" refers to a much broader scope of prejudice than a ""specific"" racism. Antisemitism also covers the various bizarre ideas that Jews exert hidden power or influence over non Jews whereas to the best of my knowledge, no specific form of racism includes any such idea. Can you imagine David Duke making claims about Black people controlling banks and the media? Besides Sara Palin's recent gaffe, I've never heard of a blood libel charge against Hispanics.

All that said, the Jewish expression to describe all of us in our wide variety is ""nation of Israel"" (small n). Note that this does not include any reference to the State of Israel.

I've tried to help but... i was kind of negligible, cause he started to CHASE them, with ghost until he got 2 shots from the tower, and the 3rd mate of theirs from mid. Right. So fiddle started to call me a noob for not helping (almost died by the middler) and killedthe small golem camp after he respawned. SO he didnt gave up and tried to score an other kill in the middle, the same way, our midder couldnt protect him from tower shots, hes a noob bla bla bla. At about the 10th minute, with the stat of 0/6/0 he said that hell start intentional feeding cause this is a fail team. I fed up like hell (Cant remember who were my teammates but they were also good) we started to own the enemy in 4v5. Meanwhile fiddle was REALLY feeding (he got 32(ish) deaths at the 52th minute) but we were leading in towers and even in kills. He realised that he failed at feeding so he started to ""help"" us with his Shurelya and heart of gold to win the game. We won ALL the ganks and teamfights before he started to come. He was something like a bad omen or idk. We just loose the game, couldnt kill a single champ, he was instantly smashed by the full-builded champs, and ye. Btw we even broke in their last 2 towers, but couldnt win. I still cant believe that there such player exists. it still thrills me...",0,leagueoflegends,False

Basically, no one is actually talking about an invasion and you are a rank amateur if you think they are.  NATO is talking about imposing a no-fly zone, but that has less to do with oil --Libya does have oil, but it doesn't have all that much-- and more to do with the fact that they can, easily, because there's already several NATO carrier groups in the Med.  

Second point: Libya is *way* more important to NATO than the other countries you mention not because of its oil, but rather, because of its proximity to Europe.  All hell breaking loose and massive humanitarian disasters in Libya are going to have a direct and immediately felt effect on Europe and, by extension, the larger economy of The West in general.  

Which is just to say that Western Europe (you can read that as ""NATO,"") has both the ability and motivation to immediately intervene in Libya in the ways that are currently being discussed --basically, the imposition of a ""no fly"" zone.  The same cannot in any way shape or form be said of the other countries you mention.  What, did you honestly believe that either Indonesia or China were about to let a US/NATO carrier group impose a ""no-fly"" zone over East Timor?  Are you drunk or just plain stupid?

As for Darfur, do you have a good plan for how NATO should somehow get in there and actually do any good?  What do think will work?  Which NATO country do you think will put up with the heavy casualties they'll inevitably take?  And for what?  Do you really think that any NATO member is enthusiastic about repeating the US ""Blackhawk Down"" experience in Mogadishu?        

And if you know anything at all about Rwanda, you know that Mogadishu is *exactly* why Clinton was politically paralyzed, and that if any NATO member was going to do anything about it, it had to be France or Belgium which, after all, were the colonial powers largely responsible for creating the situation in the first place.

I hate w'pedia cut n paste, but dude....

&gt; Reserves in Libya are the largest in Africa and the ninth largest in the world with 41.5 billion barrels (6.60×10^9 m3) as of 2007.

That's 4100 billion dollars at $100 a barrel isn't it?   DOE reckon 46 billion barrels at 2011.

&gt; Oil production was 1.8 million barrels per day (290×10^3 m3/d) as of 2006, giving Libya 63 years of reserves at current production rates if no new reserves were to be found.

that's an income stream of $180 million per day for 63 years, isn't it?

&gt; Libya is considered a highly attractive oil area due to its low cost of oil production (as low as $1 per barrel at some fields),

That's a nice profit margin.

&gt; and proximity to European markets. Libya would like to increase production from 1.8 Mbbl/d (290×10^3 m3/d) in 2006 to 3 Mbbl/d (480×10^3 m3/d) by 2010–13 but with existing oil fields undergoing a 7–8% decline rate,

Wait WAHT!? How can we maintain economic growth at 3% when oil flow rates fall by 7-8%?

That's the *key* in all this.

Music journalism has always been about the major labels, who in turn do well enough using the press as their own personal PR campaign flooding them with releases. It's a cartel.
Today major labels represent only a small portion of the industry as a whole, but they're ""old money"" and with their control over inter/national press and distribution channels they're free to represent themselves as they see fit. This is also happened with the ""war on piracy"". The flagrant abuse of customers by only four labels masquerading as representatives of not just their music, but all music.

Dying in fires and then getting fired for your burns and replaced with an orphan worker because too many parents were compaining about their children dying because of harsh working conditions is not a higher living standard.

&gt;So why do you think no one tried evidence based medicine before 1850? Hand washing is not exactly a sophisticated technology.

Because before the Civil war pphysicians were members of the gentleman class for whom actual work was anathema.  As a result the physicians who theorized about disease would never be caught dead actually treating or examining a real patient.  The surgeons who did hands-on work relied on folk medicine because they were usually illiterate and lower-class laborers.  When physicians entered the armed forces during the civil war and saw that their bloodletting and leeches and dirty implements were not actually improving the survival rates of soldiers in the field they were required, by military necessity, to adapt to the realities of the battlefield.  Previous conflict had taken place with insufficient contact between these two classes of people for the necessary synthesis of modern medical practice to take place.

When the civil war ended these ""new"" doctors returned to the hospitals and trained the upcoming classes of doctors in evidence-based medicine.  It wasn't until the third New York cholera epidemic that germ theory was really accepted as a worthwhile pursuit.

&gt;No. People dying in the streets is the natural state of humanity. Well, except for the streets part. Mostly we died in ditches. Capitalism was the first thing to generate enough wealth to alleviate this.

No, subsistence farming is the natural state of humanity.  The invention of pottery and domestication cereal grains was the first thing to alleviate this.  Urbanization turned back the clock on human survivability by taking away the ability of any given human being to support himself left to his own devices.

&gt;Why do you think those immigrants came here? because even the raw deal early capitalism offered them was orders of magnitude better than the deal they had where they came from, where they were often literally starving to 

They were told that the streets were paved with gold.  There was a massive false advertising campaign lead in Europe to promote immigration with the explicit intent of bloating the labor market and pushing wages below the starvation mark.  Only Irish immigrants fleeing the potato famine had a legitimate reason to prefer America during the Industrial revolution.  On the other end of the continent Chinese workers were worked literally to death on the railroads.  I promise you that being worked to death was not an improvement over their conditions in China.

&gt;You act like this difference is not significant when it is hugely important. The defining feature of capitalism is that no one is in complete control. That way, one person's never gets to decide the fate of everyone else.

The difference is not significant, actually.  Capitalists did not fail to take control of the government because they felt it would be anti-capitalistic.  They failed to take control of the government because they were savagely beaten down by that government in a very non-capitalistic way before they had the chance to take control of it.

Gaddafi isn't a communist, and he's doing the same shit.  In all honesty Mao was never really a communist: Chinese nationalism has been its own beast from day one and their relationship with Russia has never been especially cozy.  It is also unfair to talk about ""all the communist countries"" as though there are lots of examples when, in reality, the vast majority of those countries were just puppets of Russia and should be considered part of Russia in our reckoning.

If we reduced the number of communist states in our reckoning to the number of communist states that existed independently of one another we have the USSR as a single entity, China (arguably) and a small handful of South American countries (which are actually really interesting in that they differed quite a lot from the Russian model in their organization and ideology).

Most of eastern Europe reformed out of communism with little bloodshed once the USSR went down, showing they they were only ever communist because Russia said so.  The velvet revolutions were beautiful things.

I don't know of any case where communists won fair elections. That is quite a good reason to not be very afraid of them. The East European socialist countries were basically USSR buffer area (as a result from WWII). They weren't socialist because they wanted to, but because the USSR made them so.

Many socialist countries became so, because of the cold war between the US and the USSR. 

So in stead of saying how bad communists are, it's more insightful to see the US fear of communists as a cold-war relict.

There is no doubt that people like Stalin and Mao killed millions and there is no way to defend that.

Our disdain for his ""mild"" islamism is no secret, and I doubt his ""islamism"" is doubted. 
However, please don't blur the lines;

- The word ""islamist"" is only mentioned once in the article.
- The word ""muslim"" is mentioned only once in the article, and attributed to Thilo Sarrazin.
- The article is about Turkey and it's present handling of it's expatriates.
- The article is more about Turkish identity, heritage and culture.
- The article is about power brokering, gaining leverage over Angela Merkel and indirectly Nicholas Sarkozy, through influence.

Contradicting with an EU/Western consensus is not in of itself ""islamism"". 

I'm a secular Turk, and I believe some of what he said holds merit. 

I very much disagree that multiculturalism ""cannot succeed"". It hasn't, but it's doubtful that the idea is to blame for that. 

I very much agree that a prominent figure associated with a certain faction has every right to call out to that faction and preach that they keep their identity. While assimilation is an option for any and all families who seek to break away from this faction and stop trying, it's their choice. It is not something one can make into policy, and it should not be something people can discuss openly in political channels; I remind you, a huge part of why the Ottomans were and are regarded as barbaric is their assimilation policy, the Devshirmes. 

Integration on the other hand, by all means. If one is to live in a host society that is not his or her own, they should learn their language, comply with their norms and work to become benign, compliant members of the host society. I do not see Turkey's much despised (by myself, as well) prime minister suggesting anything less to the Turks of Germany.

Last, I have to call out what seems to be a non-objective undertone in the article. But then I'm not sure if the Economist or it's writers usually take any stances. It might just be me.

I contend that the fate of the 3-million-strong Turkish community in Germany is a lot more than fodder, and it is at the very least something that can be used as a pivotal bargaining chip with the right political moves - even though the EU regards it as merely an internal problem. Fact is, Turkey has influence, and with the way the playing field looks, it's more than allowed to level it.

Anyway, I really don't see how any comments solely about islam and how it relates to the Turkish PM have anything to do with this article, or what is reported in it.

do we process information obtained through a second, non-native language differently than that of our native language? I think most fairly fluent non-native speakers have had the feeling of remembering a conversation in their minds as a native language conversation, when in practice it was second language. this suggests its processed through the same paths at some level. however, i can't help but feel that there are some differences.

also, do people who conduct interviews and conversations through translators come away with different feelings about the conversation than if they're conducted person-person? the reason i ask is that every time i read or listen to an interview with someone who has done work in some out of the way country, the interviewer never brings up the language in which the conversations were conducted. maybe i've just used weak translators, but when they translate to my second language (let's say it's a complicated thing that pushes my linguistic limits), I find that the conversation takes a really odd turn in general. It just feels awkward and awful.

also, one last interesting thing, at least to me...is it common to speak your second language at a significantly different volume than your native language? i find that i yell my second language, probably because people have a habit of yelling here...is volume (and presumably other non-verbal cues) tied to language?

Feminism hurts men. Gay, Bi and Trans men are still men… sexual preference doesn’t change gender identity, so they are harmed by feminism as well.

The first thing to understand is that the ‘patriarchy’ is a myth. It does not exist and has never existed.

A small group of mostly male people controlled society through most of history… but there were plenty of women in that group. The patriarchy theory seriously suggests that during the Victorian era a small boy working in a coal mine is part of the oppressive group and Queen Victoria was part of the oppressed group.

The correct term you should be using is Kyriarchy.

&gt; I'm curious about your claim that feminism hurts gbt men every day -- can you elaborate, because I'm not sure what're you talking about?

Here is a short list of the ways feminist law makers harm men.

http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/e60uz/antimale_legislation_roundup/

That list doesn't include the way that young men and boys are commonly discriminated against in the modern education system.

&gt;The lack of a female president.

This is pretty irrelevant frankly. First it only applies to America (I grew up with Magaret Thatcher as Prime Minister) and Angela Merkel is the most powerful governmental person in the EU today. 2nd it ignores the fact that the majority of voters are women.

&gt;the 20% wage gap between men and women

The wage gap has consistently been shown to be a feminist myth. It’s a lie.

&gt;The common custom of women taking their husbands name in marriage

How about the even more common custom of women receiving custody of children during a divorce? 


Sorry if this came across as harsh as I’m a member of the LGBT community and a big supporter of LGBT rights. But I think it’s important to break any link between ourselves and a hateful philosophy such as feminism.

As I said in my post to your website egalitarianism supports everything positive that feminism claims without any of the anti male and trans bigotry.

It is easy to think in black and white. Just because Saddam was bad, any opposition to him must be good, right? But that ignores the fact that Saddam allowed religious and other rights to so many minorities, his foreign minister was a Christian, and he prosecuted gays much less than did the neighboring Arab countries. 

Compare that to what a ""democratic"" Pakistan does. They butchered hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshis in 1971 as the rest of the world, except India, sat by idly. Just because you are a democracy does not mean you will not be a tyranny - the tyranny of people driven by religion and other superstition as bad as the tyranny of a single dictator. 

The ""revolutions"" in Arab world we see today are not revolutions but just change of governments. They are not driven by equality or fraternity - they are driven by the people's dislike of the people in power. Shiiates disliked Saddam in Iraq, just as shiaates in Bahrain dislike their current Sunni ruler. But once you give them the power, they will be as ruthless as the ones they replaced; this has been seen in Iraq and all the other places.

As long as Islam is on the DNA of these nations, they will continue to prosecute minorities, and not just non-muslim minorities, but even muslim minorites as  the experience of Pakistan with Hindus, Christians, Bangladeshi Muslims and Hindus, and Ahmadiyaa community has shown. Malaysia is another democracy that has racist laws in place - inspired by their own interpretation of Islam. 

These countries, Arab, muslim or semitic ( including Israel) are a blight on the name of human civilization, and the sooner they learn from the syncretic experience of the mainline civilizations of China, India or Europe and derived ones, the better for the rest of humanity.

&gt;the industry equates it to lost sales and lobbyed the lawmakers

My point in that piracy is illegal because it is copyright infringement, under laws that have existed for hundreds of years. The law was *strengthened* by lobbyists, true, in the late 1990s, which resulted in the **god-awful DMCA** which many corporations and lawyers [mistakenly believe applies to every country](http://thepiratebay.org/legal) and not just the US. (Though Europe has [passed its own version](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Directive).)

Most forms of piracy already illegal before the DMCA was passed. For example, it was already illegal to download video game or music without legal authorization. The DMCA strengthened penalties, and **added penalties for circumventing DRM**. To create harsher penalties and to scare people more. But even without this added regulation, the *end result* of removing DRM is *generally* piracy, which was already illegal. (An exception would be if you ripped a DVD you owned so you could watch it on another device; which this was often considered illegal, it wasn't *expressly* illegal before DMCA, but it definitely was after DMCA.)

I took a long journey to explain all of this however:

*Piracy* is illegal because it is copyright infringement. 

*Copyright infringement* is illegal because [back in the early 1700s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Anne), the government felt that it was important to protect an author's ability to have the exclusive (but transferable) right to copy, distribute and adapt his creation. (The government also wanted to control dissemination of dissent, as Mokky has pointed out, but modern copyright laws do not do this, they do not require the government licensing of tools of media production; anyone can buy a camcorder and shoot a movie and put it online, for example.)

Without this protection (back then) a big publisher could take someone else's book, publish it themselves, and make money off it. Today, the same is true, but there are more applications. For example, huge corporations could come in, gobble up new work, and sell it themselves. ***Without this type of protection, EA could decide to take Minecraft and sell it themselves. Activision could decide to make their own Half-Life game. Michael Bay could decide to make his own sequel to District 9.*** These things are a different form of piracy than downloading a game off a torrent, yes, but they are still piracy and are still forbidden under the same statutes that forbid piracy. 

The *legal* philosophy here is that people who create something should be protected from any unauthorized use, whether that use is big or small, whether that use is by one person or a corporation. Unless the creator of something wants to make it free, wants to make it open, but even then there are restrictions.

(That said, copyright laws are flawed in many ways and in desperate need of revision.)

Edit: Bad reviews can never be illegal where there is any sort of freedom of speech or freedom of the press. Though if the industry were to try to attack reviews, they would probably start by suing in UK courts for libel against the author and publisher, since UK libel laws are so [ridiculous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_defamation_law).

The US (under Democrats) and European countries are usually pretty unlikely to act unilaterally. They may do something multilaterally, for example via NATO, but it's pretty hard to imagine any one western nation jumping in without the support of another one. Obviously there have been exceptions, but at this point too much attention is focused on Libya for a western nation to go it alone. 

Chad and Niger tend not to have huge influence in the Arab world as they both tend to identify more with Africa. Their foreign policies are mostly concerned with generating investment from outside sources. Any sort of action in Libya would probably jeopardise that.  The Junta in Niger may use the opportunity to expand its border slightly as it does have a history of border disputes but not much more. 

Iran by contrast has few strong regional allies (many Arab nations being concerned about stability issues). Of all the Arab world I would consider Iran to be the most concerned with projecting a strong image of self-reliance hence why they would be the most likely to act unilaterally. 

All this said, they don't have much of a way to do that, not to mention there are probably some domestic problems which Iranian authorities will be dealing with at the moment. 

The emphasis was more on the unilateral than the action. I actually do doubt we will see much of anything from Iran on the issue, sorry about the confusion.

Don’t blame luck when your models misfire

By John Kay
Published: March 1 2011 22:31 | Last updated: March 1 2011 22:31


When the financial crisis broke in August 2007, David Viniar, chief financial officer of Goldman Sachs, famously commented that 25-standard deviation events had occurred on several successive days. If you marked your position to market every day for a million years, there would still be a less than one in a million chance of experiencing a 25-standard deviation event. None had occurred. What had happened was that the models Goldman used to manage risk failed to describe the world in which it operated.

If the water in your glass turns to wine, you should consider more prosaic explanations before announcing a miracle. If your coin comes up heads 10 times in a row – a one in a thousand probability – it may be your lucky day. But the more likely reason is that the coin is biased, or the person who flips the penny or reports the result is cheating. The source of most extreme outcomes is not the fulfilment of possible but improbable predictions within models, but events that are outside the scope of these models.


Sixty years ago, a French economist described the Allais paradox, based on the discovery that most people treat very high probabilities quite differently from certainties. Not only do normal people think this way, but they are right to do so. There are no 99 per cent probabilities in the real world. Very high and very low probabilities are artifices of models, and the probability that any model perfectly describes the world is much less than one. Once you compound the probabilities delivered by the model with the unknown but large probability of model failure, the reassurance you crave disappears.

Techniques such as value at risk modelling – the principal methodology used by banks and pressed on them by their regulators – may be of help in monitoring the day-to-day volatility of returns. But they are useless for understanding extreme events, which is, unfortunately, the main purpose for which they are employed. This is what Mr Viniar and others learnt, or should have learnt, in 2007.

Yet the use of risk models of this type is one of many areas of finance in which nothing much has changed. The European Union is ploughing ahead with its Solvency II directive for insurers, which – incredibly – is explicitly modelled on the failed Basel II agreements for monitoring bank solvency. Solvency II requires that businesses develop models that show the probability of imminent collapse is below 0.5 per cent.

Insurance companies do fail, but not for the reasons described in such models. They fail because of events that were unanticipated or ignored, such as the long-hidden danger from asbestos exposure, or the House of Lords judgment on Equitable Life. They fail because underwriters misunderstood the risk characteristics of their policies, as at AIG, or because of fraud, as at Equity Fundings.

Multiple sigma outcomes do not happen in real life. When all the Merchant of Venice’s ships are lost at sea during the interval, we know that we are watching a play, not an account of history. Shakespeare, no fool, knew that too. In Act V Antonio was able to write back his loss provisions in full even if it was too late to fulfil his banking covenant to Shylock.

But today the modellers are in charge, not the poets. Like practitioners of alchemy and quack medicine, these modellers thrive on our desire to believe impossible things. But the search for objective means of controlling risks that can reliably be monitored externally is as fruitless as the quest to turn base metal into gold. Like the alchemists and the quacks, the risk modellers have created an industry whose intense technical debates with each other lead gullible outsiders to believe that this is a profession with genuine expertise.

We will succeed in managing financial risk better only when we come to recognise the limitations of formal modelling. Control of risk is almost entirely a matter of management competence, well-crafted incentives, robust structures and systems, and simplicity and transparency of design.

&gt;Among the many wonders to be expected from an Obama administration, if Nicholas D. Kristof of the New York Times is to be believed, is ending “the anti-intellectualism that has long been a strain in American life.”

&gt;He cited Adlai Stevenson, the suave and debonair governor of Illinois, who twice ran for president against Eisenhower in the 1950s, as an example of an intellectual in politics.

&gt;Intellectuals, according to Mr. Kristof, are people who are “interested in ideas and comfortable with complexity,” people who “read the classics.”

&gt;It is hard to know whether to laugh or cry.

&gt;Adlai Stevenson was certainly regarded as an intellectual by intellectuals in the 1950s. But, half a century later, facts paint a very different picture.

&gt;Historian Michael Beschloss, among others, has noted that Stevenson “could go quite happily for months or years without picking up a book.” But Stevenson had the airs of an intellectual — the form, rather than the substance.

&gt;What is more telling, form was enough to impress the intellectuals, not only then but even now, years after the facts have been revealed, though apparently not to Mr. Kristof.

&gt;That is one of many reasons why intellectuals are not taken as seriously by others as they take themselves.

&gt;As for reading the classics, President Harry Truman, whom no one thought of as an intellectual, was a voracious reader of heavyweight stuff like Thucydides and read Cicero in the original Latin. When Chief Justice Carl Vinson quoted in Latin, Truman was able to correct him.

&gt;Yet intellectuals tended to think of the unpretentious and plain-spoken Truman as little more than a country bumpkin.

&gt;Similarly, no one ever thought of President Calvin Coolidge as an intellectual. Yet Coolidge also read the classics in the White House. He read both Latin and Greek, and read Dante in the original Italian, since he spoke several languages. It was said that the taciturn Coolidge could be silent in five different languages.

&gt;The intellectual levels of politicians are just one of the many things that intellectuals have grossly misjudged for years on end.

&gt;During the 1930s, some of the leading intellectuals in America condemned our economic system and pointed to the centrally planned Soviet economy as a model — all this at a time when literally millions of people were starving to death in the Soviet Union, from a famine in a country with some of the richest farmland in Europe and historically a large exporter of food.

&gt;**New York Times Moscow correspondent Walter Duranty won a Pulitzer Prize for telling the intelligentsia what they wanted to hear — that claims of starvation in the Ukraine were false.**

&gt;**After British journalist Malcolm Muggeridge reported from the Ukraine on the massive deaths from starvation there, he was ostracized after returning to England and unable to find a job.**

&gt;More than half a century later, when the archives of the Soviet Union were finally opened up under Mikhail Gorbachev, it turned out that about six million people had died in that famine — about the same number as the people killed in Hitler’s Holocaust.

&gt;In the 1930s, it was the intellectuals who pooh-poohed the dangers from the rise of Hitler and urged Western disarmament.

&gt;It would be no feat to fill a big book with all the things on which intellectuals were grossly mistaken, just in the 20th century — far more so than ordinary people.

&gt;**History fully vindicates the late William F. Buckley’s view that he would rather be ruled by people represented by the first 100 names in the Boston phone book than by the faculty of Harvard.**

&gt;How have intellectuals managed to be so wrong, so often? By thinking that because they are knowledgeable — or even expert — within some narrow band out of the vast spectrum of human concerns, that makes them wise guides to the masses and to the rulers of the nation.

&gt;But the ignorance of Ph.D.s is still ignorance and high-IQ groupthink is still groupthink, which is the antithesis of real thinking.

Their plan to get it is: Stage a revolt in Libya ... call in mercenaries to massacre Gaddafi's own people... use the media to exaggerate reports of violence against civilians by Gaddafi's troops... under the guise of humanitarian intervention, send in their military to occupy Libya and secure her oil reserves.


Supporting evidence I have amassed for this hypothesis so far:

1. Libya's proven oil reserves are the largest in Africa - making it a prime target for a false flag event as described in my hypothesis.

2. Libyan's quality of life is among the highest in Africa (free healthcare, access to clean water, age expectancy of over 70, poverty rate of under 8%) - which would indicate that riots are not particularly as likely as Egypt, where there is genuine poverty.

3. [There are first hand reports from Libya and Bahrain](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ft9vv/this_is_going_to_sound_insane_but_i_think_america/) that our media is not telling us the truth about the protests (scroll down a little to see the one from Bahrain). Also it seems that the media may have been [caught in a lie about the air strikes](http://rt.com/news/airstrikes-libya-russian-military/).

4. The UN Security Council [""granted broad immunity from war crimes prosecution for the mercenaries responsible for many of the bloodiest massacres against the pro-democracy protesters""](http://news.antiwar.com/2011/02/27/us-measure-ensures-gadhafi-mercs-immune-from-war-crimes-prosecution/) - which was at the US' request. This could indicate that the US is planning to send, or has already sent, mercenaries to Libya.

5. Gaddafi has support in Libya from many Libyans; something the media barely, and grudgingly report. See [here](http://www.reuters.com/news/video?videoId=190592397&amp;feedType=VideoRSS&amp;feedName=TopNews&amp;videoChannel=1&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+reuters/USVideoTopNews+) and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebA6qUoH2h4).

6. [The US and EU are planning](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-27/qaddafi-asset-freeze-approved-by-un-as-rebels-declare-provisional-regime.html) sanctions against Libya and the freezing of Gaddafi's assets. [There is even a report that the US already has troops in Libya](http://www.prisonplanet.com/report-us-special-forces-arrive-in-libya.html). An invasion by the US (and allies) is looking likely.

7. I'm not the only one who is suspicious. Two world leaders are speaking out - see [here](http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/03/01/libya.venezuela.chavez/index.html?hpt=T2) and [here](http://www.rferl.org/content/article/2324460.html)... And [from a politician in Bahrain](http://en.rian.ru/world/20110224/162745211.html).

8. The US has done this before, in Iraq, except that time the lie was WMDs. In that instance, the media was thoroughly compliant, and many civilians were completely fooled. Since that time, not many people have gotten much smarter. The same people who were fooled before can be fooled again. ",0,conspiracy,False

Japanese people suck at speaking English for lack of conversational practice but they do learn vocab and grammar from grade school so unless they are really old or really dumb they all know a bunch of English words and phrases.

IMPORTANT: Do this dry!  Water washes off a lot of the flavor and also makes later steps harder.  It's very difficult to get mushrooms dry, which is required if they are going to brown properly. In the US, AFAIK, the manure is pasturized, so you can't really get sick from it (unlike in the EU where mushrooms will destroy you the first time you eat them), so don't sweat it if you aren't 100% perfect in this step.

Slice them about 5-7mm thick and set aside.

Pound chicken breasts THIN, make sure you cover it with seran wrap or salmonella will go EVERYWHERE! Hit with an egg wash and dredge in a flour/salt/pepper/oregano mixture.

Heat up olive oil in a sautee pan.  Once it's hot, add a tiny bit of butter and swirl it around until the foam dies down.  Now add the lightly breaded chicken breasts and brown on one side (4-6 minutes?).  Flip the chicken over and add all the mushrooms.

In the mean time, make a small roux, oil or butter will work fine, with some flour, into a thick paste.

  Once the chicken is browned on the other side, pull it and set aside on a warm plate to rest.  Deglaze the pan with marsala, add the roux, and cover.  Cook the mushrooms until they look and smell amazing, a few minutes maybe?  Give it a quick flip partway through to make sure you are hitting all the mushrooms and coating evenly.

Serve the chicken and mushrooms over whatever sides work in your diet: tons of egg noodles for carb backfill, by itself in large quantities for protein+veggies, sautee onions on the side, etc, whatever you want.

Sadly, political leaders do not always act in the long-term best interest of their nations' economies. For numerous examples, see..hell, just pick any Western democracy over the last generation or so. Also look at Castro and Mao as examples of leaders who weren't afraid to wreck their nations' economies for the sake of ideological goals.

Before WWI, there were intellectuals writing that there would never be another big European war because of rapid communications and the growing economic interdependence of European countries. There was still another war, with terrible economic consequences. Economics didn't prevent WWI, though they did play a major role in Germany's defeat. 

WWIII *can* happen. It just needs some factor to raise tensions between two major countries followed by a rapidly-evolving crisis with politicians afraid to look weak.

Perhaps there are more Terrans in Master League. Perhaps the top Terrans win more versus Zerg, but no Protoss (i.e., perhaps an ""imbalance"" is only in 1 specific matchup). Perhaps the top Terrans play more, and hence have more points. Perhaps the top Terrans face slightly weaker opponents. Perhaps there are regional differences you are not accounting. And so on. 

In fact, if you look at the top 45 EU players (out of the top 100 global), Terran has a 37.7% representation which is no longer statistically significantly different from 33.3%.

I escaped from former Yugoslavia (during wars) in Hungary (legally) and stayed appx 1.5 year in Hungarian refugee camps.  From there I applied for ""refuge visa"" with Australian embassy. This would be consider a *propel legal channel* to come to Australia on [humanitarian grounds](http://www.immi.gov.au/media/fact-sheets/60refugee.htm)


&gt;People who overstay their VISAs have at very least gone through customs and quarantine.oat people have not, meaning they could, deliberately or completely on accident, be bringing something dangerous or illegal into the country.

What you're  missing here is the intention of a ""boat people"". No ""asylum seeker"" is that stupid to bring something illegal into the country that he is seeking Asylum in.

Also, you have to understand the process. Once ""a boat person"" is on a Australian ground and he seeks asylum, Australian government cannot(due to UNHCR conventions) return the person where he came from.
In other words - the process to the degree is not different then when person comes in legally. The only difference is that you have passport and go through customs.In fact a ""boat person"" best intention is to immediately report himslef to authorities.

It's more likely that a tourist or a returning visitor will bring something illegally and potentially dangerous to the country than a ""boat person""

I speak from experience and stories from people that I met in Hungary (from Nigeria, Maroco,Sieraa leone, Middle East, Bangladesh, pakistan..the list is fucking endless)
Most of these people came to Hungary illegally like most asylum seekers in Euro Zone. Although, at that time Hungary was not in Euro Zone, but rather a ""last stop"", a ""base"" before going to Germany, Switzlenad, Italy, Englad, Norway, etc - depending how much a person had money to go there. 

(process is the same as with boat people. Illegal channels and people smugglers are used. The difference is these guys traveled by land)

Now, do you know what's the first place they visit once they enter the [destination] country?
believe it or not -  Police Station. All belongings, everything is given to the Police Officer. The reason is again simple. It woudl benefit down the track when applying for asylum/visa. 

I tell you something else. 
Once, a  person from **poorest_country_in_a_world** gives to a people smuggler 5000$ he is advised on everything. ""Do this. Don't do that. You need this. You don't need this. Once there. We do this. We go there."" 

Mate, I am telling you this from experience and people I knew and met. (a refugee camp of 5000 people sometimes is like prison. someone is guilty there, someone is not.) 

So, to conclude. The argument that you are using for ""Australia  safeness"" is total bullshit. As mention, more risk you'll have from people coming here legally and through customs. Just watch ""Airport security""- these are the people that got cought! Who know how many don't!

Again, what do you think,  where will  a ""boat person"" go first, once he lands in Australia?

As for solution.

I oppose mandatory detention. I was in refugee camp and I was 'detained' for 3 months but in  ""quarantine"". Checks for Aids, tuberculosis, etc and who know what else. After that I was given a ""refugee card"" as a temporary id and I was free to go everywhere. During this period  I was provided with food and shelter in a **refugee camp** (not **detention camp**), I often went to Budapest, night clubs, etc... I never fucked these Hungarian women as was told about as a kid , because at 19 and being bit geekish I was a big failure. Also, when you go out with one  Nigerian guy, one Moroccan guy and one European it's most likely that 2m Nigerian muscular guy with nickname ""Soldier"" will score with blonde tall women. While the two of us wil end up on a train station drinking cheapest whine, and cursing life that we didn't score (regardless that at that point both me and this guy literally didn't have a ""home"". ah the youth...)

Anyway, at same time (during this stay) my ""asylum application"" was under review. So, you stay out of trouble. You are not doing anything illegal, etc ...as it is in your best interest.

Now what can happen if you asylum status has been rejected?

Couple of things:
1. You can apply again.
2. You are kicked back to the country you came from.
3. You go into hiding as illegal immigrant.

Now, you have to understand, and I think this is especially true for Australia. Person without legal status cannot really do anything.He cannot work legally. He cannot receive medical care. He cannot apply for a loan, yet alone start a family or  let his children go to school. etc... and on top of that he has to be in constant hiding...and eventually he will get caught and sent back.

So, mandatory detention is nothing but xenophobic paranoia in my opinion.


As for application processing, not every refugee is a genuine refugee. Although a 'genuine' is a relative term. Most people I met from third world countries escaped social economic hardships. However, there were people who escape ethic violence, etc. But if you are genuine, somewhat skilfull, educated, don't have any criminal backgroundm in  99% of cases you'll get a visa in any fuckign country. I was told (when I applied for ""humanitarian resettlement"") by UN officer - literally ""chose your country"". 

As for people smugglers. I hate to say this, but it's like every businesses. When there is a demand there will be supply. From my experience I knew  people (even whole families with small kids) that were trying ALONE to illegally cross Hungarian-Austrian border across Danube. Died in process. And it fucking breaks your heart, when just two days ago you were talking with them in a kitchen.
Why? They haven't had any money to pay for people smugglers.
And It' s true, some people are desperate and will do anything to reach a ""better life"".

Finally, people who have LOTS of money. You know how they applied for asylum in Westren Europe? They buy a fucking false passport for 5.000-10.000$. Each passport (depending on a country)  had its ""price tag"". Fuck me stories taht i;ve heard (funny though) from people using these passports and trying to behave as a native of the country that that passport is from. I guarantee you that now you can buy a Australian passport, for whatever price.

So, 'illegal encouragement"" is relative term.

Anyway, as conclusion. In my opinion, if I was government and if a person coming here will contribute to Australian society in a healthy way, integrate into society also in a healthy way - not that he  has to watch footie or eats pie, but also not to be closed down in gethos......I would let anyone in, regardless on the colour of their skin, nationality, race, religion, etc....

That is incorrect.  Swiss citizens are allowed to purchase non-military firearms and keep them at home.  It matters not though as I brought up Switzerland and Finland to show only that the number of firearms available has no correlation to firearm related crimes.

&gt; My point being: both these countries exercise quite strict gun control, in contrast to the USA, and their gun crime rates are very low, again in contrast to the USA.

Actually the United States exercises strict gun control laws as well, they're just not as strict as European countries.  Every time you purchase a firearm in the United States from a dealer you undergo a background check.  We have a long list of people who are prohibited from owning firearms including felons and people found guilty of domestic abuse.  

Likewise places with extremely strict gun control laws such as Chicago and Washington D.C. actually have some of the highest number of shootings.  Until last year you couldn't even legally own a handgun in Chicago yet handguns were used in a majority of shootings in the city.  Gun control laws don't work.

The main cause of gun related crime is the same as all violent crime, heterogeneous populations.  Switzerland, Finland, and even Britain have mostly homogeneous populations made up of people who are usually more financially secure, have similar religious believes, and are of the same beliefs outside of religion.  The United States is the opposite as we have both extremely rich and impoverished, we have everything from devout atheists to the most zealous of Christians, we have everybody from anarcho capitalists to communists.  

This wide difference is a breeding ground for conflict and thus is the cause of our high violent crime rate (although your fine island does beat us in a few categories).

&gt; Criminals may keep hold of a lot of guns if guns become more tightly controlled but they won't find it nearly so easy to get more, and they won't have any excuse for having one in their posession or dwelling.

So your logic is we should bar the ownership of firearms so criminals can't get them?  Using the same logic we should bar private ownership of automobiles because most getaway cars are stolen.

The other thing to keep in mind is the fact that markets will always be fulfilled.  If something becomes illegal there develops a black market to fulfill that want.  Once again banning marijuana hasn't stopped people from getting it, in fact it hasn't slowed the rate of use in the slightest.  Making something illegal doesn't stop anybody from getting it and the black market ensures product will be available.

I'll close this by stating even if you banned guns in the United States the guns are already here.  Many Americans will refuse to surrender their arms and instead will hide them.  Thus any prohibition of arms in the United States isn't going to reduce the number of arms down to an insignificant amount.

&gt; Similarly, the law abiding not having guns will make for a lot less fatal domestic arguments, or shooting accidents.

I submit that the number of firearm related accidents is irrelevant to this discussion.  Accidents and suicides are self-inflicted and entirely at the fault of the person who is generally injured.  The number of secondary injuries that result from firearm related accidents is almost zero, it's generally some schmuck shooting themselves in the foot.  It would be like saying signal person automobile accidents should be counted when arguing whether or not automobiles have a mostly beneficial or negative effect on society.  What a person does to themselves it their own business and so long as nobody else is harmed by their actions who cares?

Your statement that banning guns would cause less lethal domestic arguments needs citations.  A spouse can kill their significant other just as easily with a kitchen knife as a gun.  Once a conflict has reached the point of lethality the available tools become irrelevant.  The only hope you have at surviving such a situation is a means of defending yourself.

&gt; The argument that domestic handguns stop government tyranny just doesn't stand up. Either the army/police is with you or against you, if it's with you you're fine, but if it's against you having a pistol vs. a tank isn't going to do you much good. Didn't work in Waco.

It worked fine in Vietnam.  Afghanistan did a good job of booting out the Soviets even though they had no real military might of their own (and they're currently doing a good job at busting the United States military up).

Might alone doesn't win the war.  This isn't even getting into the complexity that is added by the fact many military personnel would defect and take their toys with them.

&gt; Not really sure what you're driving at with the Britain ending slavery after the founding of the USA thing. Doesn't that mean that the USA was founded in a culture of slavery?

It was an preemptive strike that was (thankfully) unnecessary.  Normally when I bring up this counter to the ""they supported slavery"" argument the first thing that is mentioned is how Britain ended slavery first and thus American broke away from Britain because of slavery.  Since you didn't go there it really matters not.

With that stated you mention banning guns would prevent many avoidable deaths.  I submit that it will also create currently avoidable deaths.  I have a Minnesota carry permit and do carry a firearm on my person.  There is but on reason I carry a firearm, it gives me an option should I find myself in a life or death situation.

When somebody is threatening your life or the life of a loved one calling the police is meaningless.  The average response time for a police officer in the United States was 11 minutes in 2007 (latest statistic I've found).  Obviously it varies wildly but it's the only number available so I'll go with it.  Let's say a man breaks into your home and is armed with a firearm.  The intent of this man is to rape your wife.  Upon hearing the window break you call the police.  You're now looking at 11 or so minutes of being on your own, what do you do?  

If you have a firearm you have a means of defending yourself.  No it's not a magical talisman but it certainly tips the scale more towards your favor.  Without having that firearm, a means of matching your opponent, you and your wife are completely at his mercy.  He can rape her and be gone before the police ever arrive.  Most men would try to defend their wife even without a firearm which would likely end with them being shot and killed in this type of situation.

How can you, in good conscious, say disarming the homeowner is a just and good thing?  Even if the would be rapist was only armed with a knife the best means of defense to the homeowner will be a firearm.  In that case it would tip the scales strongly to the side of the homeowner.

In the United States most states have passed laws allowing average citizens to carry firearms.  You know what's happened in each case?  Violent crime has either gone down or not changed but never has it gone up.  Likewise gun related crimes haven't gone up in these cases either.

Since there is no negative effect and in many cases (Florida is a great example) a benefit to arming the citizenry what argument can exist to detest this behavior?  Why would you want to take the best means of self-defense away from the lawful?  Why would you advocate for putting law abiding citizens at the mercy of the criminal element?",0,guns,False

Immigration from Europe to the US was considered by some to have been detrimental to society and citizens living there may perhaps have been worried they were taking extremists on board, alongside the uneducated people that did not seem to be contributing to society but expected great things from American society.

Debates on the National Origins Bill in the early 20th century after the First World War and the Russian Revolution showed that some senators believed immigrants from Eastern Europe were heavily influenced by Bolshevik policy and would be bringing radical ideas with them. Following the Russian Revolution and the Russian Civil War, the Bolshevik regime was considered an illegitimate government formed through revolutionary means that had overthrown a young democratic Provisional Government to achieve it's means.

Coupled with this, the ComIntern set up in 1919 added potentially more fear with the potential that the USSR would be promoting the downfall of democratic states. The Red Scare in the US is proof that they were scared 'Communists' would overthrow the United States; given that they were considered by contemporaries to be one of the largest developing economic centres in the world, it's entirely plausible there were some pro-Bolshevik sympathisers in the US.

When you also consider the extensive capitalist influence in the industry of America with the traditionally laissez-faire economy meaning the growth of rich individuals, the prospect of the government being overthrown would have been pretty scary for those with accumulated wealth. 

Prior to the Second World War there was also rhetoric from Russia on the destined collapse of the US due to the Great Depression. FDR was the first President to formally recognise the USSR after the 1917 revolution, which invited some people to feel that FDR's social welfare schemes were influenced by Bolshevik policy, failing that, socialism. Thus the propaganda machine begins.

The US was not entirely on Russia's side on the second half of the Second World War. There was an order issued which stated that in the event of the USSR's regime being expelled from the country, the US was not to intervene or involve themselves with them.

The issue with Communism to a stereotypical American is that it is a concept formed with China and the USSR in mind. It is not the traditional Marxist concept that is feared as this is labelled as impossible, but the Chinese and Russian models were seen as corrupt 'replacements' for previously legitimate regimes. They were considered to be not 'democratic' and it looked as if they would remove the administrative framework that existed. 

Thus the end of the Second World War and the Cold War is quite relevant; the Americans felt the Russians would want to spread revolution to young countries and expand the revolution, whilst the Russians felt the Americans wanted to destroy them, a rather paranoid assessment based on American mobilisation and political dealings. Then there was the arms race and the propaganda machine began on a global level.",0,history,False

Wrong on all counts.

First, octane is measured differently in different places, so you can't just compare the numbers without also knowing the standard used. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octane_rating

Second, higher octane rating does not equate with better efficiency. Higher octane rating equates with higher resistance to detonation at higher compression ratios, which is commonly used in higher performance/efficiency engines, but that's a property of the engine, not the fuel. You can use higher octane fuel in a low compression engine, and you're not going to see better efficiency.",0,todayilearned,False

The trends in the graph, if they were updated like you were saying, are unsourced. They are either an extrapolation from previous data, or unsourced. I can make a graph too. It doesn't mean it reflects reality. The only real study on the article is the one I talked about. Unless you can provide the source for such values on 2009 on the graph, it is as good as I drawing another graph showing the opposing trend myself.

&gt; the trend of non-believers has been increasing.

Only in Europe and USA. Worldwide, religion grows faster.

&gt; deciding whether the premises and conclusion are valid and sound.

Almost. You decide whether the premises are valid and sound, and if the conclusion follows from the premises.

&gt; I argued against his premises and the conclusion he drew. I don't understand why you believe that this is an invalid form of discussion. (...) I would like to know why you so quickly dismiss my points based on my desire to deconstruct his argument.

I don't believe that this is an invalid form of discussion and I have no idea how you came up to such conclusion. Nothing of what I said warrants it. Nonetheless, I disagree with you merely because you haven't really *argued* anything. Arguing is something quite differently from claiming ""this guy is biased and I disagree with him, so he is wrong"" which is what you did originally.

Even after your ""extended"" reply, you did nothing but ad hominem attacks and cite a graph whose results are dubious, and unsuported by the research it claims to be based upon.

&gt; You say that he isn't actually talking about evolution (even though he specifically talks about the ""evolutionary process"" as being a basis for his argument), yet you don't back it up. 

I don't have to back it up. It is not my fault that you fail to comprehend what he is writting, and it is not my task to carry you line by line of the article to explain what the author meant with each line. It is also not my fault that evolutionists freak out every time they see the words ""evolution"" and ""intention"" on the same article and go on a tangent by preemptively defending against any correlation between the concepts, regardless of what the article actually says. The mere existence of a term on an article does not warrant the automatic conclusion that evolutionists like to make.

&gt; If that's the case, then I still find issue with his assertion that man has evolved to have a predisposition towards religion.

So be it. It is, however, pretty much accepted as true by many prominent evolutionists like Richard Dawkins. He even wrote a lot about religion as the concept of meme and why it is so pervasive in humans.

&gt; As I stated above, man has a predisposition to knowledge

No, he hasn't. Men has a predisposition to explanations. To find cause where an effect is perceived. *Knowledge* is something other than explanations. To qualify as knowledge, you have to know it, not merely believe it. 2+2=4 is knowledge, but does not explain anything. Zeus is angry is an explanation for lightning, but it is not knowledge because you do not know it. You merely believe it. There is a whole field called 'epistemology' dedicated to define what is knowledge and what is not.

&gt; Science is now taking over that role as it proves to be the greater of the two in terms of realistic knowledge gained about the world. 

So said the Babylonians. And the Egyptians. And the Greek. And the French. And now the Americans. And they were all wrong, and so are you. You should read Will Durant's *The Story of Civilizations*. Or at least [one of his conclusions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Durant#On_the_decline_and_rebuilding_of_civilizations).

&gt; Which fallacies? You haven't pointed any out, nor have you discussed them in any amount of detail.

That there is any kind of conflict between science and religion. That science is overtaking religion. That culture is progressive. That secularism is increasing around the world. Basically every premise you base your whole worldview upon is false.

&gt; I already discussed above why this statement isn't correct.

No, you have shown that I am right to say that your argument is unsourced.

&gt; You completely ignored the trend graph that I explicitly pointed out, and instead you went directly for the outdated statistics. I'm not entirely sure what part of that you don't understand.

The part where such graph is unsourced. Apparently, finding a graph on the internets linking to non-existent studies that support your point is now proving it with facts.

&gt; It's very obnoxious to spend time writing a lengthy response answering your questions only to have a fraction of my points discussed.

US models in the 80's had EGR and were loaded with emissions controls while many foreign cars had much simpler EFI and carbureted systems. 

When tuning an engine, you can generally tune for 2 out of 3 basic things. You have power, emissions, and mileage. If you tune for power and mileage, you usually are throwing emissions out the window. If you tune for emissions and mileage, there goes your power. 

California tends to have the highest emissions standards out of any state. So when companies bring cars in from overseas, they tune them for California, and then the rest of the country gets those same cars. 

This is why Europe gets so many diesels and we don't. California is super strict on diesel emissions, and the rest of the country gets fucked because of it. Can you really blame them though? That's the smoggiest fucking place on earth.

Personally I didn't like the tankomizer and hope it improves because the juice feeding method is superior to cartridges, but I just felt it lacked flavour and throat hit and I could taste the plastic the tanks were made from. I hear there are LR tankomizers now which might be better, although on TW's site they offer only a zero-day warranty which tells me they might be a bit shit and could fuck up the switch on the battery.

There is no difference between joye egos and any of the rebranded ones although some kits may come with 900mah batts and others with 650mah batts. Sailbao (A Chinese manufacturer behind the DSE series of e-cigs) do make a joye ego clone (not sure if they have an ego-t clone yet) but I'm not sure if anyone in Europe sells them. I'm guessing that because TW have the rights to sell joyetech products in the UK (excluding Janty branded ones) then the egos liberty-flights sell (Riva 510) are probably made by Sailbao and is why they don't offer a Riva-T because Sailbao haven't made one yet. I got my ego usb passthrough from LF and it works fine.

These rather modest demands have led to massive protests on the part of these unionized “public” employees.

Misspellings aside, you would be similarly outraged at the ""modest"" demand of altering your work contracts' future payout mechanics without your input whatsoever.
&gt; The purpose of a union, whether in the private or public sector, is to raise the wages and benefits of the members.

The purpose of a union is to allow for collective bargaining or negotiation, which may be used to either raise or lower the wages and benefits of the members. Frequently in Europe, during hard times labor unions will take pay cuts. They bridge the gap in the power disparity between someone who owns a company and hires at will and a mostly-unskilled worker who has no individual bargaining power whatsoever.
&gt;On a free market, or even a hampered market such as exists in the “United States” today, wages are determined by the marginal productivity of  labor (MPL). The marginal product of labor is the amount by which a firm’s output will rise if it adds one worker. This is not necessarily the same for all workers. More productive workers get paid more because they add more output and thus more revenue.

I feel like you've never worked for a large organization of any sort. Wages are determined by the lowest price the owner or managers can offer to keep the person on and productive. In no way, shape, or form is MPL used besides to see if there is a *need* for an additional worker. The very idea that labor contracts are ""negotiated"" in the same way that prices are ""negotiated"" is patently absurd. Labor contracts of all kinds are boilerplate except for the very richly paid, highly specialized workers (and even most of them), and are presented by people who rarely actually understand them as they are not lawyers (managers and HR).
&gt;The more capital there is relative to labor in the process of production the higher will be a worker’s MPL and thus the higher his wages.

This is also absurd. Why in the world would an employer pay me more if I got an automatic stapler or new computer program that *he paid for*? Why, in fact, should I expect anything but a *decline* in overall payroll if productivity raises because of capital investment?
&gt;If the union members are really worth the increased wage they are getting then they have every incentive to bargain behind the back of the union, get that wage on their own and  and cut the union out.

""Worth"" in this sense means ""can cajole the owner or employer into paying,"" which, as we've just been over, is exceedingly rare for unskilled labor. Hell, go look [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fvu95/if_you_were_given_a_choice_by_your_boss_would_you/) posted just today, for statistics about how employers barely even pay attention to marginal productivity when it comes to salary.

Picked up in more recent times during the Soft-Tech movement, but more challenging for DIYers due to the scale and care of the tanks. Tiliapia was originally one of the more popular species of fish cultivated with this. Was more popular among Soft-Tech experimenters in the late 1970s/early 80s than today and often featured in sustainable housing designs where the tanking was made an integral feature of a home design. I recall some 'earthship-like' concepts where large transparent aquaponics tanks where made into an atrium-like core for a radially-organized home or otherwise combined into integrated greenhouse enclosures. Aquaponics is often used as part of Living Machine systems used for waste processing, though usually in a more passive flow-through arrangement than intensive aquaponics systems. 

Aquaponics is sort of a bridge technique between mariculture and hydroponics and the more intensive and sophisticated polyspecies mariculture -the permaculture of the sea- where, much as with land-based permaculture, one is cultivating a network/ecosystem of co-supporting biomes of mixed species to make cultivation self-sustaining without the need for artificial aids while producing a broad variety of crops. Though called 'mariculture', polyspecies mariculture systems include marine plants and algae and can also include hydroponic farming and -in the case of system supported by Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion power plants- cold-bed agriculture. (which uses cold water to chill the rhizome layer for plants so that temperate climate plant species can be grown year-round in tropical climates) 

Note that the term 'Aquaponics' is also used -particularly in Europe- to describe a popular technique for indoor gardening based on special fluid reservoir pots/planters and expanded clay pebbles as an alternative growing medium to potting soil. It may be more accurate to call this 'static hydroponics' because you're basically putting plants in a static reservoir of nutrient fluid instead of the cycled flowing/aerated nutrient solution of a true hydroponics system -sort of like when you are 'forcing' bulbs in a special bulb vase. It's limited to a small variety of plants such as African Violets but is less messy than soil-filled planters and pot and so is popular for indoor decorative gardening. There was something of a craze with this in Germany and Scandinavia a couple decades ago. 

Another relative of this form of aquaponics is sub-irrigation gardening. Here one uses conventional potting soil but in planters designed with a bottom-reservoir for water where the water is drawn up into the soil using wicks. Planters for this are often called 'self watering' planters, but this is a misnomer that leads to misuse of the technique. When used correctly, the technique has many advantages over 'top watering' container gardening, being healthier for the plants and conversing of water. This technique has become extremely popular with urban/rooftop farmers and the group that recently developed the Waterpod eco-research barge in NYC were big advocates of it.

This has nothing to do with modelling climate. You could extrapolate from paleo-climate date, or merely suggest plausible mechanisms like Milankovitch cycles, etc.

&gt; Can your models tell me why we had a little ice age, the medieval and Roman warm periods?

The *models* can't. The physics *inside the models* can, and does, where relevant (LIA - yes. MWP - there's no agreement that this was a global phenomenon, but I've seen modelling studies which show a Europe-centric MWP. RWP - not familiar with any modelling studies on this timeperiod).

&gt; Your models cannot even predict the historic climate

They actually can, and do [pretty well]h(http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch9s9-4-1-2.html). As a matter of fact, modelling studies of various historical epochs of the planet's history gel decently with paleo-climate reconstructions. That said, there are GIANT uncertainties because we have to use proxy data to go back very far in time.

&gt; The only way warmist can gain any legitimacy was to put less emphasis on these prior warm and cold periods so that the modern warming trend appeared to be exceptional

Even our slight observed warming *is* exceptional in a geological context (and all the evidence suggests that it's not a slight warming - there's a larger signal which is masked due to various effects, like aerosol indirect effects). The climate simply doesn't warm bit-by-bit  for a century straight; there are no natural mechanisms which can explain that trend.

&gt; By using poor statistical techniques and even poorer proxy records, that is tree ring proxies and then grafting on to the tree ring data the modern temperature record.

There are more proxies in use than just tree rings, and they tend to corroborate tree ring measurements.

&gt; If the tree ring data cannot be used for the modern temperature record how can it possibly have any validity for the historic temperature record as well?

This is called the ""divergence"" problem, and it is a hot topic of research. But it's not really relevant - like I already said, there are independent sources, such as boreholes and sediment records, which corroborate the story laid out by tree rings.

&gt; But what I would like to know is this, and I do not have the resources to research this myself. When was the first paper published and who published it, that posited positive feedback between carbon dioxide and water vapor levels?

Oil, cheap labor, new places to sell our goods, etc. While I'm all for the dissemination of American people, things, and ideas, I feel that force is not the way we should be doing this.

War is not a good thing and war will never be a good thing. War to end Hitler's reign was not a good thing, but nobody could thing of another alternative. The Civil War was not a good thing. Vietnam was horrible. You could argue that good things came of these wars. For example, nuclear power, a strong U.S. central government, or... well I'm not sure anything good really came of Vietnam. Velcro? Anyway, on the other hand, some claim nuclear power is bad (derp, it's awesome), and it's true, we have the power to end the human race now. That's bad. How good is a strong U.S. central government when it finally becomes so powerful that the people have no way to overthrow it (too late?). Maybe the Confederates were right. Maybe Germany would have overthrown Hitler and ended the holocaust, and all of Europe would be united under the remarkably powerful, rich, and industrious German nation (see: present. Not poor war-torn Germany). 

Shit dude, what I'm saying is that there are few wars I will support. A war against malaria? Sure. Invading alien species bent on the destruction of humanity? Definitely, although it would be unfortunate if there was no way to make peace with a sentient alien species. A war against fellow man? Nah, not happening. Especially when they don't pose any threat to us. What are the insurgents/radicals going to do, fire their AK-47s over a continent and ocean? You could say they would attempt another 9/11.

Still, it wouldn't justify a war. The money should go to education. Right now, the State of Texas is deeply in debt and is making up for most of the money by cutting education grants and scholarships. Did Obama not just claim in his State of the Union address that he intended to make higher education available to all Americans?

First, to condense the accomplishments of Arab and/or Muslim scientists into six slides is rank condescension. Second, it leaves out the complexity of history: Yes, people who were Muslim probably came up with the underlying understanding of mathematics that made the eventual outlining of calculus possible. What goes un-said is that in the scientific philosophy of the time, the Arab world considered x/0 to be 0, not undefined - as did Eastern Asian thinkers and Buddhist thinkers at the same time. The discovery that x/0 is undefined was I believe a British innovation.

But the point is: who cares? The implied parochialism of all of these kinds of things is unproductive. No one owes allegiance or homage to any of the ""great minds"" of history; science is a collaborative, collective process implying that its fundamental truths are privy to everyone.

With today's media monopolies PBS has become that much more important. It may not be a core essntial but it's money well spent. You go bankrupt when you decide to lower your income without first cutting your budget and that why Reagan and Bush did and that is why we are deep in debt.  You want to give tax breaks fine, but damnit when you do you cut spending to match and you do so intelligently no across the board. 

This isn't your household.. this is a democracy it's not about what you want it's what about the majority wants and they want PBS.

End of story you have no say if you are the minority vote you lost that battle.. move on to the next and stop crying about how every penny counts. Eventually you'll understand you have to raise taxes not cut tiny programs that will never add up to anything significant and will wind up as epic battles in congress.

Do you really think Obama is going to let PBS go down? It's a idiotic try to make the GOP look fiscally responsible because they don't have the balls to cut military spending and they are scared to make any real attempt to cut SS or medicare since they are just clinging to having any power in congress. 

The GOP will waste more than 25 million launching bullshit trials out of the House against the Democrats with no hope in winning just hoping to create some bad press.. oh but every penny counts and you KNOW ALL.

Why would anyone want to live in your household your obvious poor, angry, arrogant and fairly dumb ? 

Why not save money by just killing yourself and taking your budeon off society. I mean every glass of water you drink makes the cost of water go up every gallon of gas you use makes gas go up. If you just kill yourself we'll have more money to balance the deficit. 

25 million on PBS is money well spent
The 1-1.4 trillion we spend on defense and related costs is money badly spent.

And oh by coincidence that is almost exactly the same as our yearl deficit.. imagine that.

So a 50% cut in military would net 500-700 billion. 
End Bush taxes cuts.. another 250 billion per year

Stop subsdizing farming and energy companies and you save another 100 billion.

Now you have to get a little more creative. Either cut do a couple more hundred billion in cuts to medicare/medicaid/discretionary funding spreading it out to not impact any one program too much.

Or a better solution I feel would be to eliminate medicare and medicaid and replace then with an aggressively negotiated national health care system which in every other industrialized nation in the world results in spending half as much on health care and living just as long or longer so your 750 billion or so in medicare/medicaid goes down to 325 a nice net savings of 350 billion off the deficit. Plus the total 2 trillion or so you spend as a nation drops to 1 trilllion.. so the private sector also gets about a 500 billion dollar saving which is then injected back into the economy. 

So you've saved up to 1375 billion dollars off the budget by making reasonable cuts, reforming health care aggresively and ending Bush tax cuts. That would be the ideal way to do it and you're still spending 5 times more on military than the next highest military budget so you haven't really weaken the nation to a point where we might be in any serious risk and you can still afford veterans care since you owe the troops that much for risking life and limb. A few more cuts and you'll have a surplus.

An easier way of course is just to raise taxes and cut military and subsidies accordinging. The nation can handle much higher taxes and still be fine and history shows that time and time again. Ideally you'd cut military by half, cut subsidies, enact national health care with the goal of making prices competitive with Europe and Canada (which doesn't just free up federal money but also your personal income as well) and raise taxes to the point that you can now pay a couple hundred billion per year down on the national debt and just stick with that for the next 50-80 years and you'll have it paid down.

See it's really not that hard to fix the budget the hard part is getting enough people to agree on how to do it and your way would be the hardest possible way to get people to agree because it would be very complex and take forever and result in more loss to the public. 

If you can't get national health care just raise taxes on the rich that much more either way they are still paying less in taxes per income than they did just a couple decades ago. The top tax bracket  now is 35% in 80s it was 50% in the 70s it was 70% in the 60s it maxed at 91% and guess what the nation didn't crumble to the ground and we paid down ww2 debts and wage a cold war against the USSR.

That alone is the real cause of our debt problems we lowered the top income bracket from 91% to 35% over the last 50 years and once it got below 50% and we didn't reduce spending we spiraled into debt.

You cannot cut your way out of this rather you have to return tax brackets to more reasonable levels. The rich need to pay higher income taxes and believe it or not they'll still be rich and still get richer especially now that the wealth gap has grown even more. We may not need to go to 90% but then again that would really help pay down the national debt especially if you went along with a 50% military cut and national health care. 

Do that and you could pay the national debt down entirely in just a decade or two because it would be fairly easy to generate a 500-700 billion dollar surplus with a 90% tax rate on the rich and strong military and medical spending savings. However something like the 1980's 50% rate would likely be good enough to make small payments over a long period of time and prove American's fiscal stability to the world.

If you are referring to me specifically I did not downvote you (I very rarely downvote anything, usually only if the comment is disruptive).

&gt;Buses, bicycles, walking, carpooling. Available/feasible in just about any metro.

Saying we should just stop using cars is a far too oversimplified way of approaching the transportation problem in the US. The US is far less than dense than our European counterparts, so asking the majority of americans to give up their personal car simply isn't feasible because of the sub-urban sprawl that most people face.

As a personal example, the distance between my wifes work and my work is about 50 miles (almost in a straight line). We picked a place that is about midway between the two, and each of us has a commute that's about half an hour by car (more if there's traffic).  Public transportation simply isn't available for that length of distance for us.

To extrapolate, I imagine that there are a lot of people that have my situation or something similar, so simply telling someone to ""take a walk"" is not going to address this problem sufficiently.  Sure we might be able to figure out a ""drive until X then meet up for carpool/bus"" type situation, but there usually isn't a very large financial incentive to do this.  

Once fuel prices start increasing people might start considering alternatives, but until that happens I don't think any major shifts will happen.

Also, some of the voice acting is bad, but I also thought some of it was great. The first island left me with bad impressions as far as voice acting a goes, mainly because the main character is pretty badly acted, as are the orcs. The Seers in the Swallows are also pretty badly acted as well. But some of it, like I said, is pretty good. Gandohar, for one, stood out to me as a well-acted character (although he's a little stereotypical as a character, and doesn't have many lines anyway), as did Cassara, among others integral to the story or not.

Look at the costs of medical care; without the aid of insurance, or Medicare, or some entity paying some portion, even the simplest medical procedure would bankrupt the average American. People are dependent on insurance, and no amount of stick-to-itiveness will ever enable a middle class person to bridge that gap, without some sort of aid. 

And in this situation, who is there to protect the people? When people literally will die without paying money to insurance companies, what prevents the companies from raising policy costs to whatever levels they wish? And when insurance companies pay for medical procedures, whatever their, cost, what prevents those who execute the procedures to raising those costs to whatever they feel like?

And to say that corporations will forever protect the best interests of their workers -- I submit to you the concept of companies outsourcing their production en masse to China and Mexico. The interests of the companies naturally led to them shutting down plants in the US, and thereby destroyed the livelihoods of their former workers. But that was absolutely in the best interests of those businesses; they can get the same labor and quality for cheaper, so why not move overseas? I don't mean to make this a vilification of companies, it's simply an observation of the natural result of the free market existing as it is. 

Yes, if the government would continue to step onto the toes of corporations they'd continue to outsource their work. But not to the extent that many (you?) think. Essentially the entirety of western Europe has higher taxes and a generally more strict business environment than the US, yet they have higher standards of living across the board, which shows that the mere existence of jobs doesn't mean a better place to live.

You question the value of a Corporate created Canadian identity, correct?
In that case, let me answer with an interrogation too: Canadian identity? What Identity? 
Until 1931, Canada was only an extension of the UK (**1**)... 
We can safely state that until then, it was more of a ""Colonial British Identity"" than that of a ""Canadian"" one. Is less than a century enough to forge a real, solid identity? The USA was founded in 1776 (more than two centuries ago, for those keeping count), and the nation was forged in a rebellion and ideals (let's vulgarize a little) which still hold a tremendous influence in their construction of an american national identity, up to this day. Does Canada's genesis as a nation carry the same historical weight? I doubt it, seeing how the land was never settled in the same way it was in the United States of America or that Canada is without a strong national Mythology (what's Canada's answer to Lincoln, or Washington?). Furthermoe, Canada is a deeply heterogeneous society (and has always been).

As we can see, it's pretty hard to pinpoint solids elements that could be used to base a Canadian identity upon. And even then, which ""identity"" would it be, that of white anglophones? 
Why should it be so?
If anyone, out of the many groups populating Canada, had a solid claim at an Identity it would be the first nations(**2**), the métis(**3**), the acadians(**4**), and the québécois(**5**)(**6**). 

You deplore the idea of an artificially created, corporative Canadian identity, yet, Canadian identity is purely a creation. Canada existed as a state (colony/dominion/confederation) before it existed as a social marker. ""Canadians"" (as in, people who self identity as such) exist because Canada exists, not the other way around. 

On a closing note:
In this commenter's eyes, the value of an Identity is trivial at best, and is a non-issue at worst. Nationalism (and even nationality as a concept) is a relatively recent invention in the history of mankind(**7**), before that, people did not identity with their nation but their town, village, region, family, tribe, etc.
Bearing that in mind, I can say that I feel I have as much, if not more, in common with anyone else in the western world as I do with that one guy living on Prince Edward's Island or a Cosmopolite Torontonian (those are just random examples).

**1**. [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Westminster_1931)	

**2**. Do I really need a source for that?

**3**. *The Métis (pronounced /meɪˈtiː/; Canadian French: [meˈtsɪs]; Michif: [mɪˈtʃɪf]) are one of the Aboriginal peoples in Canada who trace their descent to mixed European and First Nations parentage. The term was historically a catch-all describing the offspring of any such union, but within generations the culture syncretised into what is today a distinct aboriginal group, with formal recognition equal to that of the Inuit and First Nations.*

That's an interesting background story, sons (and daughters, of course) of the unions of underclass european males (*coureurs des bois* weren't exactly nobility) and aboriginals. What stronger founding history could there be? What a great testament to peaceful cohabitation, that's something you can build an identity of.

**4**. Not unlike many other people in history, the Acadians are bound in their identity by a great tragedy. The deportation of 1755 is enough (although there is more, they have their own language, culture, dialect...) to unite them behind a single claimed identity.
[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acadians#Tributes_to_The_Expulsion)	

**5**. I'll just make a quick list, facts may not point to a source to speed up writing:

* A 400 years strong presence,

* Colonists removed from their metropolis since 1763 [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec#Seven_Years.27_War_and_capitulation_of_New_France),

* Fought for centuries to maintain language and heritage,

* Recognized as a nation by the Federal Government,

* Etc.

**6**. These four groups have one thing in common: historical oppression had the hands of the British elite. But would you base your Canadian identity on that? I doubt it. The idea of an Identity is usually either something positive to join people around (although sometimes, identity is defined by a shared enemy, oppressor).

Tell you what: why don't you quickly specify and calibrate a market risk charge solvency capital model that incorporates equity, fixed-interest and property markets with an explicit risk aggregation component?

I eagerly await your results.

&gt;It seems pretty trivial to me.

No offence but this can only arise from ignorance on this topic on your behalf. Calibration of risk aggregation structures is one of the biggest outstanding problems in the Solvency II QIS 5 technical specifications. If all the collected actuarial resources of the EU insurance and reinsurance market cannot solve this problem in a robust way, then I will be very impressed indeed if you manage to do it.

&gt;The reasons noone has done it is because it would increase capital requirements and reduce profitability.

Let us use an example from the world of insurance. The Solvency II QIS 5 model errs on the side of being _too_ prudent in its estimation of solvency capital requirements. Because of the difficulty of calibrating the correlation matrices between risk sub-module components and in some cases between the sub-modules themselves, QIS 5 assigned either low (0.25) medium (0.5) or high (0.75) correlations based on expert judgment. You are most welcome to read about how European industry responded to the SCR calculated under this approach. Look for the correlations consultation paper on the EIOPA website, then look for its corresponding feedback. I think its consultation paper 74.

&gt;This means there is no money in it for greed banks or consultants.

Ah, here we go! This is an emotional issue for you, not simply an academic one. How can you expect people to take you seriously if your complaint is not based on facts but rather on your perception of how 'greedy' banks and consultants are?

&gt;They will chose a model with lower capital requirements

Actually there is a standard model. In order for internal models to qualify they need to pass the 'use test' whereby they are incorporated into every facet of the business from rating onwards, not just at the reserving and solvency requirements stage.

A small group of mostly male people controlled society through most of history… but there were plenty of women in that group. The patriarchy theory seriously suggests that during the Victorian era a small boy working in a coal mine is part of the oppressive group and Queen Victoria was part of the oppressed group.

Patriarchy refers to a general trend, it does not apply to every single situation. To suggest that is, as you say, ridiculous. But just because it does not apply in all cases does not make any less true. 

&gt;Here is a short list of the ways feminist law makers harm men.

Some of those are bullshit. The ERA that was referenced was opposed by Phyllis Schlafly, a conservative who strongly opposes feminism. Additionally, the verdicts of the numerous court cases weren't the fault of feminists -- they were ruled on by judges. I would posit that many of the ""feminist"" laws were put on the books by conservatives who believe that women ""can't rape"" or ""commit domestic violence"" -- which is a symptom of the patriarchy which you dismiss. The patriarchy harms both men and women. 

&gt;This is pretty irrelevant frankly. First it only applies to America (I grew up with Magaret Thatcher as Prime Minister) and Angela Merkel is the most powerful governmental person in the EU today. 2nd it ignores the fact that the majority of voters are women.

I disagree. America is the strongest nation currently -- its leaders are relevant to everyone. Even though you named a few powerful female leaders, that doesn't change the fact that there's still a strong majority of men in political office. 

&gt;The wage gap has consistently been shown to be a feminist myth. It’s a lie.

That's one link to a study that explicitly says more research is needed. I could find tens of links that say the wage gap is legitimate true. 

&gt;How about the even more common custom of women receiving custody of children during a divorce?

Again, this is also caused by patriarchy. Patriarchy causes men to be seen as strong, workers, etc. while women are seen as nurturers. Feminists want this to end too. 

I think you're hitting r/mensrights a bit too hard. I would posit that many feminists agree that all of the issues you linked to are issues, and should be corrected.

\[edit: I should expand on this...

I think you're right and wrong on the joysticks.  First, it's hard to say whether a lack of flight sims caused the death of joysticks or whether it was the other way around.  Suffice to say they both declined.  Thrustmaster was bought out by Guillemot and started producing cheap crap, and Logitech and Saitek hadn't yet stepped in with decent cheap joysticks.

That said, I personally can't recall having any troubles with drivers or button setup.  Simple joysticks always operated simply for me, and complicated ones were never that complicated.  In any case, the situation is much better now, with most common simple joysticks working perfectly fine as Plug and Play input devices, and the complicated joysticks have had mature software for years now (possibly excepting some Logitech products).

I also disagree that old flight sims were, even generally, ""incredibly baroque"".  To be sure, there were some very complicated ones.  I like to use the trivia fact that with Falcon 4's default keyboard setup, literally every key on the keyboard, including Scroll Lock, has at least one function, and some have as many as 4 functions (key plus shift, alt, and ctrl).  But there were a great many flight sims that were really quite basic, once you knew the principles.

Very old games like Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe or Battle of Britain had very simple flight controls.  Gear, flaps, throttle, guns.  AFAIK, it really wasn't until Il-2, well after the flight sim zenith had come and gone, that WW2 or earlier games got any more complicated than that.  (European Air War might be the exception to that.)  Pacific Air War, though, and all the Aces series had quite simple controls.  The trick, of course, is learning to fly the plane well, but that's something that anyone can learn with practice.

And really, that's the core of any game anyway: having figured out the rules, what can you do with them?  I'll use F-19 Stealth Fighter as an example, since it was my very first combat flight simulator.  It was complex for its day, but compared to something from a few years later like Falcon 3, it was quite simple by comparison.  But, all the core principles of flying a stealth fighter were modeled.  First, it was not a very high performance airplane, so you couldn't really dogfight with it, or run away from things that had spotted you.  Second, in order to take advantage of the stealth characteristics, you had to consider the radar environment you were in.  You want to fly directly toward or away from pulse radars in order to minimize your radar signature, but tangentally to doppler radars, so that would affect the path you chose to infiltrate on.  Some missions were set in a ""cold war"" scenario, which required you remain undetected, so you had to avoid roving aircraft patrols and populated areas and carefully plot your route around the radars.  And then there was flying itself; you had to know the basics of takeoff, cruise, and landing, including using flaps and brakes at appropriate times, though the landings were generally very forgiving.  In a way, I actually think it and similar simulator games of the era should be reexamined as ideas for modern console games.  I just don't know if they could be made to work with a controller in their original form though.

Anyway, that's why I think your comment is rubbish.  It looks to me like you had a bad experience and now think anyone who didn't is abnormal.

And, I'm very happy to say, flight sims are making a comeback.  I'm pretty sure they'll never regain their former glory, but seeing DCS A-10 and Black Shark, Rise of Flight, LOMAC, and soon Cliffs of Dover, warms my heart.  Also, it's great to see Thrustmaster back to producing quality kit like the HOTAS Warthog and the T500 wheel, as well as more competition from Saitek (even though I'll probably never buy anything they make) and Logitech.  It's about time for CH to refresh their offerings too.  It's a genuine Renaissance, and hopefully we'll get a lot more cool games in the future.

+1 for making me write all this though.

&gt;No anarchists thinks that we will succeed every time.

Then what is the point?  Fight so that you can have anarchism for a year and then go back to statism once you inevitably lose?

&gt;Given complete exploitation on the other hand, a lot of people tend to find anarchism superior.

A) only slaves are completely exploited...and I mean actual slaves, not just some low-ranking employee who equates their situation to slavery, but has no idea what slavery really means.  Most people will never face complete explloitation.

B) most people seem perfectly happy to be exploited in many ways, as long as it means they get to live a comfortable life...hence, the USA.

&gt;That's a ridiculous statement. It's like saying that it required ""blind faith"" if the allies thought they could defeat the Axis.

It was obvious that Germany would not stop until it controlled all of Europe.  If they did nothing, those nations would have fallen.  Their fighting required no blind faith, it just required that they be presented with an obvious threat.  Notice how the US didn't get involved until they were attacked?  Yeah.

What about Libya?  Do you actually believe those people are fighting for anarchism?  ...really?  I'm sure there are some anarchist groups fighting alongside the people, but the only reason the insurrection has been so successful is that they're fighting against a tyrant.

But, what's that?  [They've already set up the precursor for a new state?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Libyan_Council)

The story is, quite literally, about the creation of the world.

To talk with blizzard support for them to say ""stop using curse"" strikes me as odd and counter productive, unless they have a very similar story from a lot of people.

Their argument wasn't to use 3rd party add-ons. Their argument was to stop using 3rd party add-ons from curse.com. Go to www.deadlybossmods.com rather than downloading it through curse. That was the argument.

The story makes lots of sense. There are plenty of people out there doing bad things, and sure, I bet maybe someone does X or Y. However, if you're letting people upload X,Y, and Z without any known verification protocols or anything that *actually* maintains the veracity of the upload, then you get that.

Blizzard has no reason to squelch most of these add-ons.

i don't really visit improper sites. First, in Europe, my college network makes it almost impossible. Second, the only thing I could point to that I had done differently was updating my add-ons through Curse. I block flash and have ad-blocker.

My story makes plenty of sense. In fact, while i was on the phone with Blizzard-US working on my account recovery I still had the add-ons in my computer and had my password for my blizzard account changed. 

Uninstalling the add-ons from curse solved my problem. Curse doesn't make add-ons. It is a dispersion site. The problems are much likely greater since curse.com's expansion into MMO, Arena Junkies, etc. They're a bigger target for the broad community source.

It's far easier to ignore a problem or blame the users even if you're the source. This isn't a new phenomenon. Hell, Blizzard has done it recently rather than fess up to the problems. ",0,wow,False

Brazil has a deep, rich musical tradition with many cultural similarities to the United States; both traditions involve the coming together of African and European diasporas that fed each other and grew in depth and sophistication hand-in-hand over time.  Much Brazilian music is sophisticated but also possesses tremendous depth of groove, which makes it easily accessible to musically non-sophisticated ears.  It's no surprise to me that everyday Brazilians would gravitate toward good rock, good hip hop, and good electronic music from around the world.

It is a logical fallacy to assume that because I dislike many of the actions of the US government over the last 60 years that I automatically support everyone else who feels the same way. Besides, we both know you don't actually believe that and that you are just trying to get a rise out of me.

While I don't support Gaddafi, my government, which is in a ""special relationship"" with America's, [does](http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/mar/01/eu-arms-exports-libya). It's our weapons killing protesters today, right now in fact as you read these very words. 

So much for us being an enemy of the brutal dictator. 

&gt; The dead soldiers in that montage didn't die while gassing millions of Arabs or defending pump-jacks.

Actually, some sadly did die defending oil facilities. They were amoung the first sites captured. A wise move given Saddam's slash &amp; burn last time. 

I knew a UK para who was deployed in Iraq twice. He spent some of his first tour guarding oil facilities alongside some military contractors. That's why he quit the forces, his words were ""that's not what I signed up for"". 

&gt; I guess we shouldn't pass judgment on N. Korea, they simply have a differing economic system.

Good point, but I was only trying to be funny there. I'd have brought up Stalin myself, makes North Koera look like the Magic Kingdom.

However, a lot of what was supposedly done to fight dictatorial communism wasn't the same thing. Note I mentioned Korea as a ""good"" war earlier. The support of Saddam came from him saying he was ""anti-communist"". That certainly wasn't wise, particularly given that communism never took root in the middle east. 

&gt; but that does not detract from the spirit in which our soldiers have served

I agree completely. The para I spoke of did it purely out of national pride. Back then college degrees wasn't even an incentive here as *everyone* got free tuition. 

For what it's worth this is partly why I am so angry at our leaders. Any thought that they let *us* down is far out-striped by the soldier they put in harms way. 

&gt; Your views are not mainstream. They are rejected by the majority of level headed thinking citizens of the United States.

Only because those level headed people are largely misinformed about history and geo-politics. The idea that the invasion of Iraq was to ""bring democracy"" is madness and counter to decades of consistent precedent. It goes completely against the grain. 

Ultimately the west wants one thing in the middle east: stability. If that stability is brought by a dictator that is also friendly to our interests then that dictator gets our full support. So you get the Shah of Iran, Mubarak in Egypt, the Saudi Royal family and Saddam all treated as allies. We do not do this because we are evil; we do it because it makes our own countries powerful and prosperous. 

&gt; You have the mentality of a 9/11 truther, who takes the slightest of evidence to serve as a foundation for some grand scheme of back-room dealings a propaganda that have everyone fooled but you.

Just like the Christian people sustain the Vatican and the Islamic people sustain Saudi Arabia. I see you point.

My point is that support for Israel is running out. US is in the process of self destructing, I doubt they'll continue to see the value in supporting Israel beyond morally. In Europe the last people who remember the Nazis are all but gone. And in Arabian nations the people will gain a voice. *Jewish* (i.e. apartheid) Israel will become pretty isolated and it will be reflected in the economy. Don't fool yourself, those who can *will* leave for somewhere better. It's already happening now - and so many Israelis getting dual citizenship, I wonder why?

It all comes down to a rather simple principle: water runs down following the route of least resistance. Palestinians have nowhere to go, lots of Israelis have (lots of Israelis don't too that's right but the Israeli elite does and will). So you get a *Jewish* Israel that will become increasingly fundamentalist and racist (it already is with prohibiting cross-religious marriages in fear of Jewishness being overtaken by other ethnic/religious groups). I don't see how Israel will be able to survive as a *Jewish* state more than at the most two generations.

EDIT: I would like to add something. 

Those processes usually follow a common pattern: very few leave in the beginning then it slowly accelerates and suddenly everybody wants to leave. Those who leave early will find their new home countries open and welcoming, those who wait till the last minute risk not being allowed in. So late in the process there will be a rush to get out before it's too late.

I watched her cat and her apartment while she was away - and since her place was closer to my work, I ended up crashing there pretty much every other night. 

While she was away we barely talked on the phone because it was so expensive. She returned from Europe but was going away again in a week to visit an aunt.

The week or so she was back was very weird... no intimacy at all and we only saw each other a couple times. I wasn't sure what to think about it as I was in love so I was stupidly blind to the warning signs. 

Anyway, she leaves for her second trip and I decide to crash at her place that night. I soon find an empty condom wrapper under the pillow and start freaking out. 

My girlfriend at the time was on a plane, so I couldn't confront her yet. I decided to call her best friend (who was going through a messy divorce because she cheated on her husband). Her friend claimed to know nothing about it and told me that she felt like my GF has been acting weird lately. She also mentioned that they didn't talk at all while my GF was in Europe. 

In the week my GF was in town, she complained about a very large phone bill because of all the time she spend on the phone with her best friend (who I now know didn't talk to her at all).

I poke around her place looking for more evidence and I don't find anything else at the moment so I go to her computer. I check her web history and find some weird stuff. 

Around 2am the first night I didn't see her, she Googles 'Condom effectiveness' and some similar terms. She also went to Trojan's website and looked up the exact type of condom that was on the wrapper. 

I notice that the purse she uses 99% of the time was on her nightstand and remember her saying she just bought a new one for the trip. So, I dump out the old one. I find empty packaging for the morning after pill. 

The morning after pill (Plan B) is actually 2 pills that you take 12 hours apart. There's a line on the package for you to write when to take the second pill. She wrote 4:50 p.m. - telling me she took the first one at 4:50 a.m..

At this point I have a nice timeline. I know she banged someone before 1 a.m., freaked out about it, went to a 24 hour drug store and bought a morning after pill and took it right away. 

An hour or so later she lands and starts texting me (Both I and her best friend had left messages). She finally calls me about an hour after that when she gets to her aunt's place. 

I decide to only tell her about the wrapper first and see what she says. She concocts this stupid, stupid story about finding a condom at work, opening it with a friend and making a water balloon. She says she put the wrapper in her pocket and it must have slipped out after doing laundry and it ended up under the pillow... yes she expected me to believe this. 

I keep pushing her, start telling her about the searches and the morning after pill and finally she admits it. 

She won't tell me who it is, and I just say to her ""tell me now, because I'm just going to find out later"" but she still refuses. 

I tell her she's a fucking whore - and I'm sure lots of other things I don't quite remember - and hang up. It's like 5am at this point, so I just drive home. The next morning I remember that I have her MySpace password (this was 5 years ago). I'm curious about who she was talking to while in europe, so I check and the same password works on T-Mobile's site. 

I look at the bill from the month before and see that out of 500 overseas minutes used (at 99c each) she talked to one number for 420 minutes. I'm able to see the current month's calls in detail and I see that she talked to the same number around 8pm on the night she cheated and also for 90 minutes after I got off the phone with her that morning. 

I call the number... it goes to voicemail... it's her boss. Her boss that's 15 years older than her and married with 2 kids. 

I tell her I know who it is, and she begs me to call her. I do and she starts telling me that she's in love with him and he loves her yadda yadda yadda don't tell his wife yadda yadda yadda don't tell our work. I tell her to go fuck herself and that she's a pigwhore and hang up.

I find out later that apparently everyone at her work knew about it and he got fired the next day without my involvement. 

I debate for a long time about telling his wife, but ultimately decide not to because then his marriage would end and he'd be with my ex problem free. So out of spite for her, I kept my mouth shut.

I'll wrap it up here, but there's a somewhat interesting epilogue if anyone's interested. 

Oh, one more thing... The reason I knew it wasn't my condom wrapper under her pillow? She was a virgin when we started dating and I was cool with it... her first time was when she cheated on me.

They found it was only necessary to purchase the control of 25 of the greatest papers...

There are two ""animal"" GM foods, rBGH in milk and the ""GM Salmon"" 

**A. Risk of Toxicity / Allergenicity**

There has been significant concern over the use of rBGH to increase milk production. 

The concern is centered on the fact that using rBGH in cows increases the levels of IGF-1 in the milk. The fear is that by drinking milk which has used rBGH, it will increase your serum levels of IGF-1 and might cause cancer. 

It was approved by the FDA despite this, and here is why.

From the EU evaluation of rBGH:

[""Mean concentrations of IGF-I [in milk] were 2.77 ± 1.36 ng/mL in control cows and 3.30±1.40 ng/mL in treated cows, respectively.""](http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scv/out19_en.html)

Compare that to the normal range as stated in a laundry list of scientific papers :

""1-34 ng/mL, normal milk (Malven et al., 1987; Campbell &amp; Baumrucker, 1989; Juskevich and Guyer, 1990; Collier et al., 1991; Schams, 1991; Zumkeller, 1992)."" 

From the FDA re-evaluation in 1999:

[""Assuming 5000 ml blood plasma volume in a 60 kg person and assuming this person consumes 1.5 liters of milk containing 9000 ng IGF-I from rbGH-treated cows (as opposed to 6000 ng IGF-I in milk from untreated cows), the maximum increase in blood IGF-I would be less than 2 ng/ml of which only one-third could be attributed to the use of rbGH. This minute increase would dilute into the endogenous pool of circulating IGF-I.""](http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/ProductSafetyInformation/ucm130321.htm)

and here is one more paper I found.

[""From a consumer perspective, bST was unique, and special interest groups loudly predicted dire consequences. However, introduction of bST had no impact on milk consumption, and milk labeled as recombinant bST-free occupies a minor niche market. ""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10527114)

While there are scientific opinions that are critical of rBGH safety [such as this one](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11733423) they fail to provide evidence that IGF-1 occurs at a rate beyond the physiologic range. It simply hand waves the point and moves forward. 

GM Salmon have yet to be commercialized, but there is also fear of increased hormonal levels. While I do not have a citation on hand at the moment, the levels of growth hormone have been show to no be significantly increased compared to a control. The GM salmon simply expresses that hormone over a longer period of time compared to the normal, seasonal salmon.

**B. Risk of Environmental Damage **

In the case of rBGH, there is no potential of harm to the larger ecosystem, but it has been shown that it can increase mastitis. Mastitis is an infection of the cows utters which can both cause pain and taint milk with bacteria. The only solution is to use antibiotics to help prevent infection. In my opinion that is enough reason alone to not use rBGH.

The real concern over the approval of GM salmon, is the a paper from 1998 which predicted that it could cause a population crash. The trait doubles the growth rate of the salmon, and in the wild these fish would out-compete normal fish for mates. The company, aquabounty, which wants to approve these fish has tried to solve this problem by making all commercial fish both female and sterile (lol Jurassic park). However, it is not a perfect solution, and it has been scientifically predicted that as few as single fertile GM fish, which escapes into the wild, might destroy wild populations. The fertile GM fish would consistently win mates but would produce offspring which would not survive the winter. The current solution has been to seek approval for use only in inland fishing operations as opposed to net pens which are connected to the ocean. 

C. Risk of making a technology no longer useful.

There is no real risk of resistance in rBGH or with GM salmon.",0,askscience,False

The Mongols already destroyed a massive chunk of Islamic knowledge when they sacked Baghdad, the capital of the Caliphate, of the Muslim world essentially. There was no internet back then. There were many books whose only copies were stored there. The Muslim world never fully recovered from that.

The remaining empires became focused on preserving power and on military conquests, figuring that was all they needed. Eventually economic stagnation caught up with them too. It was really the European economy which fueled their adventures and advancements and it was the Islamic economy which fueled Islam's initial expansion as well (it was after the Islamic dinar was coined and effectively became the world's ""reserve currency"" to use the term loosely, that the Byzantines were deposed from the top of the food chain and the Arabs expanded into Central Asia and India... you needed an economy that could support these types of long-range missions).

The Ottomans fell not because they were behind in military science, but due to a stagnated political and economic system from which the Arabs revolted. Imagine if they survived long enough to discover oil under their lands in the 20th century? They'd still be around today. Hell, even the post-Mughal southern Indian kingdoms made technological/engineering advances. The British learned rocketry in warfare from Tipu Sultan, which they then used on the Americans (the rockets' red glare? those rockets were from India). The Europeans weren't always more advanced in technology than the people they were conquering/colonizing. And one could argue missile warfare is now the predominant form of warfare in the world.

Anyway, that (economic issues) seems to be what gets the Arabs revolting (referring to current events). They overthrew the Turks, then a hundred years later are doing the same to the Western-backed (or ex-Soviet-backed) governments (who are essentially post-colonial proxies).",0,science,False

First of all, your timeline is a little off.  there were plenty of people, like Florence Nightingale, preaching sanitation before the American Civil war.  But there is a deeper point.   Do you really think that, in in the more than two thousands years between Hippocrates and the Civil War, there wasn't a single doctor who spent time with barbers and surgeons?  That this contact didn't exist during, say, the 30 years war which killed as much as third of the population of Germany, or the Napoleonic Wars which saw the death of at least 3 million soldiers?  If so, you actually have a bigger problem.  What revolution in society occurred between 1815 and 1850 that allowed an information exchange that hadn't happened for literally thousands of years?

&gt;Urbanization turned back the clock on human survivability by taking away the ability of any given human being to support himself left to his own devices.

1. Depends. If you're looking at certified International Schools then yes but for your regular language school probably not. Expats are notoriously unreliable so there is always a high turnover rate at language schools. I also know people who make their living doing private English tutoring and don't even go through a language school. I taught at international pre and primary schools so that's another option.

2. Some places will require you to sign a contract while others will simply give you an incentive, like a bonus or a visa refund, to stay the year (some schools will try to back out on this though).

3. Yes. And you should have enough to travel on holidays (and overseas they get a lot of holidays!). You can always teach private lessons to make extra money. I made extra money teaching swimming lessons.

4. Depends. Korea and Japan do, probably because it's needed for a work permit or visa. A lot of other countries don't require it or if they do it's just a formality for the work permit (no one verifies these things; I know someone who simply forged theirs).  In my experience TESOL or TEFL are definitely helpful but aren't necessary (you can demand higher pay if you have one though).

5. No. Most schools are supposed to be English immersion but some might give you an assistant. 

I've taught in Asia but never Korea or Japan. I'm assuming they will require proper paperwork and it will be a little more demanding. They also will pay you more and can provide you with housing and even airfare. If you're looking at a less developed country though, they're really disorganized and schools will pretty much hire anyone (I'm certainly not an expert in grammar and you would be amazed how many young hippy/traveler ESL teachers are out there). 
 
Another important thing to consider is that you have to be a white native speaker; most Asians and Eastern Europeans will not hire an Asian-American even if they are fluent and definitely not a person of color.   ",0,travel,False

&gt;Americans equaled or exceeded respondents from the other four nations in their ability to name their own head of state (99% for Americans, 99% for the French, 96% for the British, 95% for West Germans, and 89% for the Italians). Americans were about as likely as the others to know the prime minister of Japan, but were considerably less able to identify the heads of state of Western European nations. And the five-nation survey that formed the basis for Almond and Verba's The Civic Culture (1963) found a considerably higher percentage of Americans and Germans able to name four or more party leaders when compared with the English, Italians, or Mexicans. Americans were behind the Germans, but comparable to the British, in the ability to name four or more cabinet offices. Finally, a 1988 National Geographic survey asked representative samples of adult citizens from nine countries to locate 16 ""places"" on a map of the world (14 countries and two bodies of water). Overall, Americans correctly located an average of 8.6 places, putting them sixth out of the nine countries included in the survey. More specifically, Americans were above average in locating places relatively close to them (e.g., Canada, Mexico, Central America, the Pacific Ocean, and the United States itself), while they were below average in identifying areas that are geographically more distant. (Carpini 2005)

Certainly the US can do better -- especially on press freedom where it ought to be among the top 10 and in terms of educating its populace about the Eastern hemisphere where it is so involved -- but we're a fairly average nation in all of the items listed in the ""perfect"" recipe for fascism, so I'm maybe a little more worried about other nations who are decidedly below average (and have far more economic and social turmoil) going down that path than the US.

**Admittedly some studies, including the one cited, point to Americans' lack of knowledge about international (read: Euro-centric) current events as evidence that Americans are ""less informed"" about world events than Europeans. Likewise, in some survey results Europeans are applauded for testing better than Americans on European geography while American knowledge of the Western hemisphere is a dismissed afterthought. I think that's fairly stupid for what I hope are obvious reasons, but if you accept that as a basis for judgment then Americans are slightly below average for a developed nation in terms of ""world"" current events, though still within normal range.*",0,worldpolitics,False

&gt;Sadly, political leaders do not always act in the long-term best interest of their nations' economies. For numerous examples, see..hell, just pick any Western democracy over the last generation or so. 
  
Yes, but those Western democracies have been picking on smaller nations and not ones likely to cause a grand scale type war.
  
&gt;Also look at Castro and Mao as examples of leaders who weren't afraid to wreck their nations' economies for the sake of ideological goals.
  
Sure they did, but they weren't picking fights with other countries that they had trade agreements with while doing it.  Big difference.
  
&gt;Before WWI, there were intellectuals writing that there would never be another big European war because of rapid communications and the growing economic interdependence of European countries.
  
I'm sure this is true, but the common sentiment at that time was the Europe was ""an armed camp"".  Essentially a powder keg of alliances just waiting for the right moment to drag everybody down into a quagmire.
  
I'm getting away here from my larger point, which is that if WW III didn't happen during the Cold War, despite a less globalized economy and all of the proxy wars going on between major powers, it's even less likely to happen now.
  
A lot of that had to do with MAD, of course.  Combine MAD with economies that are pretty much entirely dependent on each other, and we have the situation we're in.
  
When we're talking about a second American civil war, MAD really doesn't come into play.  
  
At least I don't think so.  I mean if say, for example, North Dakota decided to secede, would they threaten to use the nuclear arsenal there on DC if they don't get their way?  I doubt it, but it's an interesting what if scenario.

&gt;The biggest downside is the risk of dental fluorosis, which is only an aesthetic problem.

In a large sense, so is a cavity and its resulting fillng. Dental caries are a non-threatening condition, and to mandate fluoridation to prevent them is akin to medicating a population to combat male pattern baldness.

Much has changed in society since the decades when fluoridation was introduced that can easily account for the minimal benefits it has been shown to provide. Better access to quality care, higher education levels, more habitual teeth brushing, and a greater emphasis on personal hygiene are at an all-time high. 

Lastly, the treatment of fluoride is topical. Ingesting it is unnecessary and provides no increase in efficacy. To the contrary, there are both skeletal and neural risks that are only incurred by ingesting fluoride. That alone should be enough to dismiss its use in daily nutrition, regardless of the mounting evidence that already suggests fluoridation is an unnecessary practice in modern societies.

Extensive calcium encrustation of the gallbladder wall has been variably termed calcified gallbladder, calcifying cholecystitis, or cholecystopathia chronica calcarea. The term ""porcelain gallbladder"" has been used to emphasize the blue discoloration and brittle consistency of the gallbladder wall at surgery. Some authorities eschew these terms and instead call all calcified gallbladders ""porcelain gallbladders.""
A plain abdominal radiograph that shows a right upper quadrant pyriform opaque mass with curvilinear calcification; this finding suggests porcelain gallbladder.
The true incidence of porcelain gallbladder is unknown, but it is reported to be 0.6-0.8%, with a male-to-female ratio of 1:5. Most porcelain gallbladders (90%) are associated with gallstones.
Calcification in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen has several causes. Calcification can be categorized by the organ system in which it appears; for example, calcification can affect the liver, gallbladder, right kidney, digestive tract, peritoneal cavity, right adrenal gland, and retroperitoneum.
Diseases associated with these organs include large gallbladder opaque calculi, milk-of-calcium bile (see first image below), echinococcal cysts (see second and third images below), schistosomiasis and other granulomatous diseases,6 old liver infarcts that have healed (see fourth image below), calcified renal cysts, renal calculi, calcified nonparasitic liver cysts, primary and metastatic liver tumors, benign liver tumors, and calcification in old adrenal hemorrhage and adrenal masses.
This plain abdominal radiograph shows milk-of-calcium bile and a calculus that obstructs the Hartmann pouch.
A plain radiograph of the right upper quadrant that shows curvilinear calcification in 2 hydatid cysts in a patient from a region in which hydatid disease is endemic.
This transaxial CT scan of the liver shows a calcified hydatid cyst, which can mimic porcelain gallbladder.
A plain abdominal radiograph of the right upper quadrant of a patient with a history of a hepatic injury that occurred 10 years ago shows curvilinear calcification in 2 mass lesions in the right lobe of the liver.
Patients with porcelain gallbladder are usually asymptomatic, and the condition is usually found incidentally on plain abdominal radiographs, sonograms, or computed tomography (CT) images.
Surgical treatment of porcelain gallbladder is based on results from studies performed in 1931 and 1962, which revealed an association between porcelain gallbladder and gallbladder carcinoma. Porcelain gallbladder is an uncommon condition; recognizing the clinical and imaging characteristics of the disease is important because of the high frequency (22%) of adenocarcinoma in porcelain gallbladder. Nonetheless, the causal relationship between porcelain gallbladder and malignancy has not been established.
Surgery should not be delayed even if the patient is asymptomatic, because the occurrence of carcinoma in porcelain gallbladder is remarkably high.
Although most porcelain gallbladders are incidentally seen on plain abdominal radiographs, the definition and sensitivity provided by CT scanning appears to be far superior to the definition and sensitivity of radiography. CT is also superior to radiography for staging gallbladder carcinoma when it is a complication of porcelain gallbladder.
Sonograms do not depict porcelain gallbladder as well as CT scans do; sonographic findings can mimic those seen with a nonfunctioning gallbladder, large calculus, and emphysematous cholecystitis. (Patients with emphysematous cholecystitis usually have diabetes with no point tenderness [ie, diabetic neuropathy]. In one third of these patients, the white blood cell [WBC] count is within the normal range. High-level echoes that outline the gallbladder result from gas within the gallbladder wall. With emphysematous cholecystitis, the male-to-female ratio is 5:1.)
Occasionally, hepatobiliary surgeons may order angiograms when a malignant change has occurred and staging is required.
In porcelain gallbladder, plain radiographic findings are usually straightforward and are not often confused with findings related to other causes of calcification in the right upper quadrant. If doubt exists, cross-sectional imaging with a modality such as ultrasonography or CT can more accurately depict calcification in the appropriate organ.
Porcelain gallbladder must be distinguished from large solitary calcified gallstones, which are seldom as large as porcelain gallbladders; however, exceptions can complicate a definite diagnosis. Milky bile syndrome is characterized by radiopaque material that causes sufficient opacification of the gallbladder to cause it to be depicted on plain abdominal radiographs. Calculi in the cystic duct and/or Hartmann pouch usually obstruct the gallbladder, and the gallbladder wall will appear inflamed.
The spontaneous expulsion of limy bile along with gallbladder calculi has been reported. The puttylike radiopaque material consists of calcium carbonate or, less commonly, calcium phosphate or calcium bilirubinate. The appearance of limy bile syndrome may simulate that of the gallbladder after the oral or intravenous administration of contrast medium; differentiation between limy bile syndrome and the gallbladder requires knowing whether cholecystographic contrast medium has been administered to the patient.
Calcification of the gallbladder wall or milk-of-calcium bile may have identical appearances on sonograms; therefore, plain radiography is important in distinguishing these entities. Calcified hydatid cysts in the liver are fairly common in endemic areas, such as the Middle East, Eastern and Mediterranean Europe, and North Africa. These cysts can mimic porcelain gallbladder on plain abdominal radiographs; however, the patient's country of origin or history of travel to endemic regions suggests the diagnosis of calcified hydatid cysts.
Ultrasonography will reveal the true gallbladder. Fataar et al described calcified gallbladder granulomas in schistosomal infestation that are dense enough to be seen on abdominal radiographs.
Serpiginous calcification, as seen on plain radiographs of the abdomen in the region of the gallbladder neck, appears to indicate gallbladder schistosomiasis in patients from endemic areas.6 Calcifications in nonparasitic hepatic and renal cysts, in the adrenal gland, and in liver tumors usually are dissimilar to those in porcelain gallbladder. If confusion remains, sonograms or CT scans can be used to clarify the issue.
Emphysematous cholecystitis can mimic porcelain gallbladder on sonograms; however, their clinical presentation is distinct from that of porcelain gallbladder. Ring-down shadows from gas within the gallbladder wall or lumen may be evident, and plain radiographs may show gas within the gallbladder fossa.",0,circlejerk,False

Whereas the Western world was born in the cauldron of that power dynamic. It's natural for Westerners to assume that any power about to stand up to them will seek to do the same. Actually, assuming this is part and parcel of being an expansionistic power. Because let's face it, in a qualified sense, we'd be perfectly willing to expand into said other powers region. Hell, we *are* there now. Even if a rival weren't expansionistic to begin with, or is not fundamentally expansionistic by character, said rival would *need* to engage in some expansionistic behaviour just to effectively defend itself. 

But in the Western world our narrative holds a strangely apposite concept at it's core almost as deeply as it's expansionistic history, which is of course the notion of bearing witness to some universal set of values (which is actually not unique to the west; the Islam expansion was based on a universalism). These super-set of values has been articulated in different and evolving ways throughout our history. Starting out as a combination of Manifest Destiny and a mission to ""civilize the savages"". Following that were the ideas of the Enlightenment which softened outright missionary zeal into an imposition of charity. Then WWII left only America with a strong industrial base and an inherited mission to spread the antidote (strong democracy) of a largely European problem to the whole world...which was similarly a charge the USSR took up but instead embracing a missionary zeal for scientific socialism. And now here we are. This is all we know and its contradictions (however realized and acknowledged they may be by westeners themselves) nonetheless seem to have no straight-forward, ""encapsulable"" solution. And if there's one thing we've come to fall in love with, it's solutions that are easily encompasses in a few phrases. And that would be because up until now it *has* worked because up until now we've been largely expanding into frontiers...but the frontiers are all gone now. And we're still left holding our guns and our hearts and our rugged individualism, convinced that not only will these things save us, but are also the answers to all the problems of any other part of the world with vastly different geopolitics, histories, values and day-to-day reasons for all sorts of small things that we readily overlook because...we like to encapsulate our answers into overarching grand statements; which work great if you've just conquered a continent...we have trouble seeing those devils in the details I think.

http://www.mprize.org/blogs/archives/2010/01/hi_dr_feinman_a.html

&gt;What I think we're seeing is exactly the divergence within these populations that you know: that carb is really rather bad for overweight, insulin-sensitive people, such that replacing it even with SFA is relatively harmless -- whereas for lean, insulin-sensitive people, SFA (and dietary cholesterol, its fellow-traveller in omnivorous diets) is likely more *relatively* harmful, because carb is less able to derange the metabolism. We have to remember that any time we look at these studies and see only modest or borderline-significant effects: 66% of the US population is overweight, and half of that majority is obeese; Europe is somewhat better-off, at 49.8% and 13.3% in men and 36.0 &amp; 13.5% in women per MONICA. So the deleterious effects of any nutrient with a differential effect on low-BMI, insulin-sensitive people will tend to be blunted by the much larger number of people for whom such effects are blunted by their ""larger"" problem.

&gt;It also means that the deleterious effects of a rise in SFA intake are at least temporarily outweighed if it is is part of a dietary shift into a lower-carb diet when it is successfully used for weight loss (as opposed to just being a person's self-selected default diet, which of course is what's going on in teh studies in Jakobsen and in the Swedish, Greek, and US Nurses low-carb/high-protein studies). But it's reasonably clear that if you're insulin-sensitive -- which, interestingly, is what one is likely to become after losing weight on a successful low-carb weight-loss diet! -- the effects of SFA become more *relatively* harmful as teh deleterious effects of carb recede.

&gt;Moreover, I think we have a fair amount of evidence for a specific (albeit widely exaggerated) benefit of omega-3 fatty acid intake, which unfortunately the Jakobsen meta-analysis couldn't evaluate. I think it's reasonable to expect that a discrimination here would have further emphasized the benefits of these fats.

&gt;At the end of the day, we have to go with what we've got. Until we get a couple of thousand healthy twenty-year-olds locked up in metabolic wards for sixty years or so for a really vigorous diet trial, I think saturated fat AND carbs (especially starchy carbs) stand out as things to reduce in the diet, in exchange for vegetables, fruit, lean protein, and PUFA (and probably MUFA) as things to maintain or increase. And most people should lose weight!",0,science,False

The same FDA that approved aspartame actually refused to do so for many, many years, citing numerous studies showing it caused brain tumors in laboratory mice by producing dangerous excitotoxins. It was only approved after Rumsfeld (former CEO of Searle, original manufacturers of aspartame) used his new position in the Reagan administration to appoint a new FDA comissioner Arthur Hayes. The FDA formed a Board of Inquiry with their best scientists and revoked the petition for approval, but that revocation was overruled by Mr. Hayes who would later on go work as a PR agency of the manufacturer of the product he had just made legal. You couldn't make this stuff up if you tried. 

You should also know aspartame is illegal in all children's food products across Europe, I wonder if their scientists know something ""yours"" do not? 

Point being that the FDA is and has been a politically manipulated agency, sometimes to a laughably easy degree. This is not conspiracy theory, this is blatant fact. 

As to your peer review citations:

Dr. Woodrow Monte in the peer reviewed journal, Aspartame: Methanol and the Public Health, wrote: ""When diet sodas and soft drinks, sweetened with aspartame, are used to replace fluid loss during exercise and physical exertion in hot climates, the intake of methanol can exceed 250 mg/day or 32 times the Environmental Protection Agency's recommended limit of consumption for this cumulative poison.""

""The effects of aspartame are documented by the FDA's own data. In 1995 the agency was forced, under the Freedom of Information Act, to release a list of ninety-two aspartame symptoms reported by thousands of victims. It appears this is only the tip of the iceberg. H. J. Roberts, MD, published the medical text ""Aspartame Disease: An Ignored Epidemic"" -- 1,000 pages of symptoms and diseases triggered by this neurotoxin including the sordid history of its approval.""",0,fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,False

I gather since you only mentioned the Milankovitch cycle, that there is the only one plausible mechanism, but what Milankovitch cycle lasts only 50 y, the duration of the little ice age? The problem with invoking the Milankovitch cycle is that I could equally invoke the same 'plausible' mechanism to explain the current warming.

Of course that both the Dalton and Maunders minimum coincided with colder then normal temperatures would suggest that the sun does play a role, but this is heresy to warmist since it doesn't involve carbon dioxide.

&gt;The models can't. The physics inside the models can.

This seems to me to be at least poorly expressed. To help me understand what you are saying, please explain what is the physics inside the models that explains the LIA, even though, apparently, the models, itself, can't.?

&gt;which show a Europe-centric MWP

But what aspect of weather can cause a European anomaly that lasts for hundreds of years?

&gt;They actually can, and do [pretty well]...

I was not referring to the last century, a 3rd order polynomial could fit that, but to historical climate which would include the LIA and the MWP.

&gt;Even our slight observed warming is exceptional in a geological context (and all the evidence suggests that it's not a slight warming - there's a larger signal which is masked due to various effects, like aerosol indirect effects). 

It is only exceptional if you have poor proxies for temperature. 

In the IPPCC publication (fig 9.5 a) what in the modelling is responsible for the warming from 1900 to 1940 and the slight cooling from 1940-1960, but is not responsible for any warming since 1960, unless AGW is invoked?

&gt;(and all the evidence suggests that it's not a slight warming - there's a larger signal which is masked due to various effects, like aerosol indirect effects). 

Ah yes the models suggests much larger warming, but rather then find fault with the models lets invoke the idea that there is an unknown contribution from aerosols that is masking the warming that is expected.

&gt;there are independent sources, such as boreholes and sediment records,

Boreholes, do you mean ice-cores, and what is being measured in sediment records? 

&gt;Two cites:

But according to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tyndall#Main_scientific_work)

""He concluded that water vapour is the strongest absorber of radiant heat in the atmosphere and is the principal gas controlling air temperature. Absorption by the bulk of the other gases is negligible.""

I don't have access to those articles even though they must be out of copyright.  Does Tyndall explicitly state that carbon dioxide causes positive feedback of water vapour levels? That is what I would like to know. Who first suggested that mechanism?

* *On the no-fly zone: This is much easier said than done. The US Pentagon has said it pretty clearly already -- to establish a no-fly zone in these circumstances would first mean hundreds of sorties aimed on taking out all existing air defenses. And it's not clear to anyone which positions are held by rebels and which bu Gaddafi's forces.*

* *There is a nascent Libyan government forming in Benghazi. This authority should be the focus of US and EU efforts. It will do nobody  any good to impose a system. But if the shadow government being formed as we speak represents the new, democratic Libya, then they should be recognized and aided as such as soon as possible. Particularly in terms of humanitarian and medical assistance.*

* *This is the Libyans' fight. Anyone who's not a dictator can tell who's right and wrong here, but unfortunately, outsiders cannot intervene. It would take a UN mandate to put troops on the ground, and the UN would never approve a mission to topple Gaddafi. Neither NATO nor any member state can act alone.*

* *The events of Libya, Egypt, Tunisia, Yemen, Bahrain, and elsewhere are clear enough lessons: 1989 is ancient history. Not the 1989 revolts which threw off Soviet oppression, but the 1989 of Tiananmen Square. News now travels almost instantly. The more prosperous the country, the more there is to lose from brutality.*

* *Assuming Gaddafi falls (and one must assume he will), this wave is just starting. China cannot do again what they did in 1989, at least not without serious effects on their economy. And so neither can Malaysia and Indonesia.*

* *There are obvious targets where this will hit outside the Middle East: Venezuela, Myanmar, Zimbabwe ... And it must ultimately lead to a fundamental reunderstanding and reorganization of policy around Israel.*

Publishing research papers is expected of pretty much every MD working in a large academic medical center (at least in the US). Some MDs also hold a PhD and publish even more.

And if I understand it correctly, I was actually wrong insofar as the import tax, unless there is a specific tariff that goes above and beyond a country's VAT, is actually the VAT.

Remember that VAT is collected at all points along the supply chain, on each incremental amount of ""value"" added at that point - but recouped, so only the final consumer is paying the full amount of the tax.  It's the same as sales tax, except that a sales tax is _only_ collected at the last point of sale.  The only difference is that it makes it easier for governments to collect taxes - and, I suspect, as a result to raise taxes because they're harder to get around, but that's just me being a conspiracy nut.

When you import an item, the govt. has not had the chance to collect tax along the path of production, so they collect when you enter the country.  That is why tax-free reciprocity exists in some countries -- hypothetically you're always supposed to pay the VAT in the country you import something to, but if there's tax-free or tax-back shopping, you can claim the tax back (or part of it, minus ""fees"") from the country where you bought it - since you're not using it there.

It's not triple taxation, but double taxation, insofar as you're paying tax on your income, THEN paying tax again on consumption -- and a consumption tax is, as we all know, a regressive tax.

The class difficulty is comparable to tougher US schools. While the classes aren't bad, I feel like the classes at my home university were better. The teachers I've had in America seemed more interested and explained the subject material better. But take that as an anecdote, I've only had 8 professors here and it's a big school. 

The people are great. Extremely friendly (but pretty shy, you will have to do the talking first). I'm friends with quite a few local Hong Kong students but the majority of my friends over here are international and exchange. You already have a lot in common so it's hard not to hang out together. Hong Kong is expensive by Asian standards, but fairly cheap compared to western Europe or North America. Most things in Hong Kong are cheaper (except housing). If you can get a place in a dorm you're set because they are cheap and close to campus. If you can't, you're going to be paying out of your ass for a cramped apartment. Food is significantly cheaper, transportation is very cheap, and shopping is a good deal because there's no sales tax in HK. 

I think I like meeting different people the most. It's really a breath of fresh air to be surrounded with a bunch of Chinese and European students instead of a bunch of frat bros and bookworms at my home university. The location is amazing as well. I just came back from a weekend in the Philippines and this weekend I'm going to Shenzhen. If you want to see East Asia, Hong Kong is probably the best hub to be at. And unfortunately no I am not learning either language. I was going to take a Mardarin class both semester but my schedule did not allow it.

If you are doing math, be prepared to work hard. The math classes are difficult here because of all the mainland students who sleep 4 hours a night and spend the rest of their time studying.

I'm in the UK, and it works fine here, but I wanted to try to get to the bottom of why it doesn't work in the US. I've got a VPN endpoint in the US (mostly for watching those videos that *you* guys restrict us from seeing), so I used that to get to YouTube... and I could still see the video! So I've no idea what YouTube are doing, but it's not the usual IP-address blocking.

Other things it could be:

* IP address ""region"" stored in a cookie, Flash storage, or similar - i.e. they ""detected"" your region the first time you went to the site and then ""stored"" it to stop you from working around it?

* Something to do with your ISP that's being passed on? I see a few folks in the US commenting that they've been able to see it, so this is my favourite hypothesis. Do US ISPs pass on some kind of additional flag on traffic to state the origin country? It'd have to be something that would work when a VPN tunnels over it, so I'm thinking at the IP level: somebody who knows their IP flags better than me want to comment?

* Some kind of detection of your OS? I know that Windows exposes all kinds of shit, especially if you surf with IE (e.g. whether you've got Office installed, what version of Windows, etc.). I wonder if the Windows region is encoded in there somewhere (I know that Europe gets a different copy of Windows with support for a gazillion languages, no embedded WMP, etc.). That would explain why there are a few edge cases in the comments where people can/can't see it when their fellow countrymen can't/can. But it wouldn't explain why Canada can see it (assume Canada gets the same Windows version). Also, YouTube would need a fallback for non-Windows users...

I don't have an answer, I'm afraid, but that's my thinking about how they're doing such a brutal detection of US users. It sucks that you can't see this - there's a few links to mirrors in the comments; take a look.

&gt;MISTAKE ON DOCUMENTATION Of WEAPONS EXPORTS

&gt;Mr Bugelli also referred to the recent controversy sparked by a European report which said that in 2009 Malta had exported €79 million worth of weapons to the Libyan government.
&gt;
&gt;The government had claimed that Malta had only issued a transit export licence to an Italian company and the arms were never actually in Malta.
&gt;
&gt;In a letter in The Times yesterday, Italian ambassador Luigi Marras questioned government’s explanation and said that Italy had only exported €8 million worth of small arms to Libya in November 2009.
&gt;
&gt;Mr Bugelli said this evening that the Italian company’s local agent, WJ Parnis England, admitted a typing error on the documentation submitted to the Maltese government.
&gt;
&gt;In an official letter, which the government received from the agents earlier today and which was made public, the company admitted that an “extra 0” had been inadvertently typed in.
&gt;
&gt;The Italian factory which supplied the military equipment to the Libyan government was Fabrica d’Armi Pietro Beretta.

&gt; Netherlands, Portugal, America, France... all of these have different cultures, mind sets, affluent citizens, population size/densities etc.

Portugal is certainly different, but the other three have a lot in common. For one thing, they are the top 3 [agricultural exporters](http://www.mapsofworld.com/images/world-top-ten-countries/world-top-ten-agricultural-exporters-map.gif). They are also the earliest Western countries to turn into a republic (1568, 1776, 1789). If it wasn't for Napoleon NL would likely still be a republic. FR and NL were the main supporters of US independence too. People in France love going on strike, people in NL don't care for authority and people in the US aren't exactly fans of the government either. The main differences between the three are that France is very Catholic and very conservative, and people in the US are a bunch of obedient wusses (indeed, ""brave"" is something you call an obedient dog or young child in NL :P). ;)

Ah, the ""I can't be racist because I have foreign blood"" argument. Almost as common as ""Some of my best friends are black"", and just as wrong. You would be hard pressed to find someone in the UK without foreign blood, as we are a nation of immigrants. Sadly, your genetic background has no bearing on whether you are racist - latently or otherwise. 

&gt; An odd apostrophe mistake is quite a different matter from bastardising a language.

You are hopelessly clueless about language. Every language, ever, since the dawn of time has been constantly 'bastardized'. Language evolves constantly. The English of today is entirely unrecognisable from the English of just a few hundred years ago. English itself is a 'bastardized' form of other European languages - the original language here would have been Celtic, so much more like Welsh or Gaelic than English. Every wave of immigrants since then has contributed their own words and meanings. Many of our words are Anglo-Saxon in origin - so they came from Denmark and that area. Half of our words are French in origin, from the Norman conquest. 

One of the reasons English can be confusing for foreign language speakers is that it makes little logical sense - the grammar is not consistent, because English is made up of about 10 other languages.
There is not one 'correct' form that remains the same. 

I doubt there are any black people born in the UK in the last 50 years who are not capable of speaking English as used at school, offices etc. Some use Ebonics among themselves, which contributes to a community identity. It is in no way lazy or stupid, and saying so is offensive and ignorant. As for those not born here, well, if you want to complain about foreigners having foreign accents, you may as well join the BNP now. 

The Polish community in my area is English-speaking, but they tend to teach Polish to their children, and they often speak Polish at home and socially. Is that lazy and ignorant?

Reddit recently surpassed 1 billion monthly page views, I will assume this hasn't changed too much.
I will assume that this is the U.S standard of 1 billion (which is one order of magnitude above the European Standard)
The average number of days in a month is 364.25/12 = 30.3541 days
This means that the number of page views per day is about 1,000,000,000 / 30.3541 = 32,944,478.67

Alexa says that the average page views per user per day is about 9.5
This means that the number of **active** users must be 32,944,478.67 / 9.5 = 3,467,839.86

Going by the numbers on [this page](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/the-numbers-count-mental-disorders-in-america/index.shtml) an ""estimated 26.2 percent of Americans ages 18 and older"" suffer from mental illnesses. 
We can assume that most of Redditors are from a first world country and will have a similar percentage here.

The number of active users with a mental illness must then be 3,467,839.86 * 0.262 = 908,574.04

**Conclusion** - The answer to your question is approximately **908,574.04 active Reddit users have a mental illness**

Until that point Hitler had tried to have his cake and eat it too by producing *both* butter and guns because he was paranoid that too much austerity at the homefront would lead to a recurrence of the Kiel revolt during World War I; in his mind the Germans at the frontlines were holding their own and far from broken, but had been betrayed by factions within the high command.  That sense of betrayal, no matter if it was misplaced or not, had an incredible psychological effect on him and influenced his decisions until the end of his life.

More relevant though, is that fact that one could argue World War II—even after Goebbels had announced the transformation of fighting into a ""war of annihilation""—wasn't a truly total war in the sense that all sides used all of their available resources against each other because of one crucial point: the universal restraint by all sides in regards to chemical and biological weapons.  There was an unofficial agreement among both signees and nonsignees of the Geneva Conventions that because of the horrific implications of chemical or biological war—combined with recent technological advances such as long-range bombers—neither side would use them.  So during the total war that was World War II, a number of unwritten ""laws of war"" were adhered to and international relations were not totally anarchic.

And even during the Cold War, although no major powers geared up for a total war lest it lead to an escalation of conflict with the opposing camp, there were a number of wars in which possible civilian casualties had much influence on the conduct of operations.  These were not ""total wars"" in the definitive sense, but the scale of destructive power utilized and the less than perfect concern for excess civilian casualties gives them an aura of ""total war"".  For example, more bombs were dropped on Laos than across all of Europe during World War II, and Vietnamese and Korean civilian casualties were proportionally just as large as many of the most devastated of European countries.  A similar situation occurred in Afghanistan during the Soviet's intervention where the Soviet's, although they had hardly mobilized for a ""total war"", in many regards fought in a manner that one would expect during a ""total war""—which obviously entailed enormous casualties among Afghani citizens.

In summary, it seems debatable that World War II was the death knell for public acceptance of ""total war"".  It seems to me more linked to a general cultural shift that led to a spatially and socially divorced homefront of increasingly sheltered, safer, and prosperous citizens in combination with greater journalistic penetration of warzones that brought back more emotionally intense—i.e. more relatable depictions of the horrendous nature of war thanks to color images and video of increasing quality—reports that were previously impossible due to technological limits.  The public realization of this stark dichotomy separating their own secure and privileged lifestyle from that of the ""enemy"" civilians uncertain, destitute, and brutal existence led to reflection and moral outrage.  It other words, it wasn't until the Vietnam War that, at least Americans, became increasingly unwilling to unleash destruction on the scale of ""total war"" against other peoples.

Of course this doesn't represent a irreversible shift in popular opinion.  This opinion can easily be shifted back towards active support of ""total war"" if the majority feels—whether such a feeling is rationally justified or not matters little; the genuine perception, even if it doesn't reflect reality, is all that matters—sufficiently threatened, wronged, or separated from the conflict zone.  But although it's very arguably, I think in a very general sense it can be said that over the past few thousand years, and especially the last few decades, humanity has become increasingly—although not without occasional and regional ups and downs—humanistic in its outlook due, but not limited, to shifts in philosophical outlook, such as Buddhism, Christianity, and the Enlightenment; increased wealth, meaning that one has more attachments—no one is more dangerous than one with nothing to lose; and more efficient infrastructure systems, including everything from roads to the Internet and also its periphery effect of globalization.",0,worldnews,False

Over here in Germany we have censorship laws. They cover the Holocaust. You are not allowed to lie about it in public. Also we have censorship laws that disallow you to make public statements that either incite hatred/violence against minorites or generally incite people. Mocking religions in public is illegal in Germany. We also have very far reaching privacy proctection laws. So you can't publish pictures of people without their consent (if it is not newsworthy to the general public). And some other stuff. I don't think we have anything that would cover something like Fox News, though.

I believe that is all about responsibility. In the US people are supposed to be responsible and self reliant. If someone tells you crap, you should know better. In Germany they protect the public from people that talk crap (like about the Holocaust or against minorities).

If you know the US and Europe you will find that in the US everything comes down to personal responsibility. Each and everyone (now even including kids sometimes) is responsible for their own actions, for their own good and so on. If you are bad off, it is your own mistake. If you drank and kill someone you get the chair. If you are rich, you deserve it. You worked for it.

Over here in Europe society gets blamed more. You are personally not ultimately responsible for your own fate. So the government protects the ""stupid"" public, the people that are not the masters of their own world, from clever Holocaust deniers and other things.

Generally I am more with the US side. I am more libertarian leaning. But that is because I am from Germany. If I lived in the US (which I have decided against, even though some things are VERY nice), I would maybe lean more towards the censorship side.

Last year, worldwide, smartphone app markets made $2.2 billion sales.

The Apple one showed 132% year-on-year growth, the Android one showed 861%, the Nokia one 719%.

For the moment, people apparently still aren't buying apps on Android. It'll be interesting to see how these figures look next year.

It's likely that part of the issue here is that Apple really only covers the high-end market (ARMv7 devices). Most people who go out and buy an iPhone or HTC Desire or whatever are doing so because they want a smartphone. However, especially in Europe, Android also addresses the low-end market. Many people who go out and buy a ZTE Blade do so because it's about the same price as the featurephone on the shelf beside it, and has a proper web browser. They won't necessarily even see it as a smartphone, and depending on vendor it may not be marketed as such. Clearly, these people are less likely to buy apps.",0,Android,False

Defense and infrastructure are functions of a small government. Education is a function of a big government but a government can still stay small if that's the only non-core function it provides. Health care is an enormous sector of the economy, and if the government provides that as well, then it will be a big government. You can't have government being the pay-master for a trillion $ sector of the economy and expect government to stay small.

&gt;If it weren't for our own government intentionally sabotaging our social programs and bankrupting itself, we could easily have the funds to provide a social safety net to make the world envious.

Social democracy is a failed type of economic organization. Before you cite me Norway or Sweden (and ignore Spain and Greece), I'll point out that any where it's been tried, INCLUDING the Scandinavian countries, it's led to slow economic growth.

Europe became wealthy BEFORE it adopted social democracy. Since then, it's just been resting on its past achievements and not improving itself.

&gt;Instead we have a bunch of politicians indebted to corporations and acting strictly on their behalf. Meanwhile, we have idiot ""small-government"" people arguing for less regulations and more privatization of everything.

I understand that you've been brainwashed by the propaganda of the unions of the government employees to blame all problems on ""small government"" and ""deregulation"", but the fact of the matter is the economy has become MORE regulated every year, and now is as regulated as it has ever been. Furthermore, social welfare spending is as great as it has ever been.

This has nothing to do with corporations, except for those weapons and 'green-energy' corporations who lobby government for contracts.

You would still have these magical abilities (like healing a limb that's been crushed or surviving a kidney stab with a dagger) without actually having to resort to completely fantastical weapons. That's the only point I was trying to make. 

For instance, the AK74 wasn't even released until a year before the Fall of Saigon and wouldn't have been available in the bulk of fighting in Vietnam but it's in the game during that time. It's an anachronism, sure, but the gun existed close to that time.

Magic in a Medieval setting isn't an anachronism.

1) Many people still do not feel that unfettered capitalism is a good thing. They want an alternative and Marx gives you a very different way of looking at things. 

This is not an unreasonable point of view. Bear in mind that all the most successful economies are mixed economies, not pure capitalist ones. Also bear in mind that the countries with the highest quality of life are social-democratic countries that attempt to combine social justice with a managed element of capitalism. These developments would not have come about without inspiration from Marx's ideas, and from the many, many people who have developed his ideas in new directions - including unions. 

2) Marx came up with an awful lot of different ideas, some better than others. Alienation, class struggle - even the labor theory of value - all are still interesting and many would say they have a lot of truth to them. Why not read some of his philosophy for yourself and compare it to your own experience?

3) The communist leaders in Russia, China and Eastern Europe certainly do not fit Marx's idea of where society should be heading: they were not workers owning the means of production, they were oligarchs - practically feudal oligarchs. They were mostly rather unpleasant people who hijacked his rhetoric to advance their own careers - no more ""Christian"" than the evangelical leader who lives like a king and ignores the poor, or the ""Conservative"" who grows the government and creates a security state. There will always be greedy, cunning and domineering types who try to take over by using a nice line of talk.

There is always something lost in translation, but the goal should be to minimize this and provide footnotes and supplementary information so the reader can get the nuances of the original.

I am not speaking against any of these other translations, since I am not familiar with all of them, but some translators have been known to omit whole sections or change the format from dialogue to monologue. Care must be given to words that have too much modern connotation that were never there in the age it was written. **When the translator interprets for you, he is doing the thinking for you without asking you.** One example I would like to give is how Sachs translates a Greek phrase (sorry, I don't have the Greek in front of me right now) that is literally, ""the things of Aphrodite"" or the ""Aphrodisiac things"" as simply, ""sex."" Sex has very modern connotation of reducing it down to the mere act, but Aristotle included other things such as food, alcohol, etc. with that phrase to show the bodily things that needs to be moderated.

Another example is ""eudaimonia"". A very important term for Aristotle. It is often translated as ""happiness."" (This is the other reason why you want consistency in the translation, so you know when Aristotle is referring to a key term or concept, since there are also other words that could be translated as ""happiness."") The sense of this word is something like ""being well-favored by the divine"" (eu-good, well prefix; daimonia-divine). This shows that there is an element of chance or a part of true happiness that is outside complete human control.

Lastly, I know that I had recommended the Sachs as the best available, but my professor still made a ton of changes to it in class. It's not perfect, but it's apparently ""the best currently available."" However, I have heard that there is a new translation coming out this year (in June, apparently) by Robert Bartlett (Of Boston College) and Susan Collins (who wrote that Claremont article), which is supposed to be excellent. I'm really looking forward to checking it out because I LOVE reading Aristotle, haha.

German optics are by far the best in the world, however Japanese lenses are cheaper and do an adequate job. Before HD video, resolution was only 420 lines (Interlaced!) so the cost/benefit ratio was not there for the more expensive lenses. The Japanese lenses cost over $10,000 per camera.

2. where it's assembled

3. where the engineering and design are done

4. where the majority of its parts are manufactured

These tribes do not understand the implications of interacting with the outside world, because their interaction with other tribes is sparse typically (the ones with large extensive trading operations are not isolated) and could not prepare them for the reality of modern industrial global capitalism.

Once they have been introduced, the process is irrevocable, and they will never know what it is to be part of their original culture. If you could find some way to convey these messages BEFORE you make contact with them, which I really honestly hold to be impossible, maybe you could let them have a choice in the matter. If you simply send a medical delagation and say ""we're here to cure your mumps and measels"" you've already crossed a line which cannot be uncrossed.

You also need to keep in mind that the people in these tribes rarely if ever respected as sovereign controllers of their own land and territory once contact is made, and that the history of contact with previously isolated tribes is one followed by massive exploitation of resources and neglect of social services. You can't just operate in dreamy hypotheticals where the only dynamic is us hiding the internet away from dudes in thongs.

Lastly, I have to point out that it is also highly patronizing to decide for them that knowing about the external world, and placing them in it is somehow better than letting them live in isolation. The Mormon example is very poor because Mormons know that there is a wide world out there comprised of Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, the rest of North America and that some of those places are important in the story of their own origin. Letting a Mormon child access the internet and other forms of non-Mormon-controlled media is to allow the Mormon child to gain more accurate understandings of the things that are already a part of his/her life. This is wildly different from coming to an isolated tribe with unfathomable technological power and forcing a modernist perspective on them by violating the illusion that their personal cosmology is legitimate. Not only do you violate their way of life, thought and communication, but you do it in a way that simultaneously isolates them from the things that you show them.

If you were going to offer to send a kid from an isolated tribe to Hogwarts, or some equally posh and non-fictional boarding school, all expenses paid, so that they can have agency in a modern world and real opportunities, it would be a very different conversation.

Granted I live in Europe and we only have GSM and *one* type of 3G, so it's a little easier to just switch to a Google device here than in the US. Still you *could* switch your carrier next time you buy a phone.

Most devices are bound to have modifications. It's the nature of the OS. It's open and free for everyone to adapt to their needs. They *do* add value, and at least choice. I personally hate TouchWiz, but kinda like Sense, and finally now that I've grown to like stock Gingerbread I will stick with it. Some people *like* TouchWiz and hate Sense, or they like Sense but hate stock Android. There's so much hardware out right now, I really think there's one device for everyone.

I have been using a Hero with (an old version of) HTC Sense, and I switched to the Nexus One a while ago. I really like it, but I have to say, I miss some features of Sense (and that's only the old Sense version... I've seen some additional pretty nice stuff on newer HTC devices).

Granted, *now* I prefer stock Android with Gingerbread. But back in the days when manufacturers started with the modifications stock Android was a lot uglier.

You/We can hate the modifications/skins as much as we want, they *do* actually add additional functionality. And Google has already incorporated a few ideas from those modifications.

Android never would have gotten so far if Google had imposed strong restrictions on how OEMs may modify the OS. As long as a specific set of features is compatible Google approves. Other things don't seem to matter, for example crippling Bluetooth support, or UI changes.

Every single country has at least one carrier with GSM+W-CDMA. But for instance in Europe there's no CDMA carrier.

So, in other words: dad started a fight he couldn't finish, kid gets a do-over? Does it work like that in any world you're familiar with ?

&gt; But didn't the UN kind of already outline a Palestinian state?

Yes, it did. Quite clearly. That division wasn't accepted by Arabs in the region and combat was initiated. You don't get a do-over just because you lost a war you started.

&gt; Isn't Israel building, without regard for these borders, in these areas.

Since borders were never demarcated, that would be an inexact proposition.

&gt; Doesn't the word 'occupied' indicate that they aren't a part of Israel?

And by not annexating them Israel has made clear that they are not part of Israel proper, thus open to negotiation. But it would be wrong to believe they are part of some Palestinian entity, because there was never one. Jordan, the rightful owner of those lands, relinquished their claim to them, but did not negotiate who has that claim now. 

&gt; You said leave them with nothing.

Re-read my words. I said their negotiation position is leaving them with nothing.

&gt; Right now they have something, thus you implied that Israel should take all the land and displace the Palestinians.

You know what they say about assuming, right? I didn't say anything of the sort.

&gt; If that's not what you meant you should refrain from broad ranging vitriol as it serves no purpose in an intelligent discussion.

What kind of chip is that in your shoulder, a Z-80 or a 386 ? Perhaps you should refrain from public discussion until you learn to read.

&gt; Might I remind you that Israel's existence only came to be because they declared themselves an independent nation and were recognized by numerous countries.

Actually, no. The partition came first. Israel accepted it and declared independence. 

&gt; the EU is very likely to support it

Funny. Doesn't sound like what the EU is saying. Let's see what Sweden, no big friend of Israel, has to say: http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=210555 ""Sweden is not considering going the way of a number of South American countries and unilaterally recognizing a Palestinians state within the 1967 lines, Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt told The Jerusalem Post on Wednesday.""

I love NY, but only to visit, and I've never spent any time in California, but I think I'd like it.  Whether I'd be able to afford it is another question entirely.

Personally, I want to get married in about five years, enjoy the life for (maybe three years) a bit and then have or adopt kids.  I'm not opposed to adopting because I'm not the healthiest person alive, so I wouldn't want to pass along some bunk genes to another generation and make them have that burden when there are healthy kids out there who need a set of loving parents.  Seems selfish.  Either way, I definitely want to be a Mom and think I'd be pretty damn good at it.

15 years?  I hope to still be raising kids, working, and enjoying my life.  Maybe by then I can take some sort of two month tour of Europe with my family.  That'd be pretty great.

See? Now you're presenting *actual* evidence. Now we can start discussing. On to read what the PDF actually says. The link on the website is broken so I went to NatCen website and fetched the actual one [here](http://www.natcen.ac.uk/media/329307/bsa%2026th%20questionnaire.pdf). The questions are available together with the % of people who answered each possibility. You're free to peruse all questions that you deem pertinent and make up your mind. Below I excerpt those that I find relevant.

The question 714 onward (search Q714) deal with spirituality and religion. 40.4% answered that they possess no spirituality. 59% answered to possess a degree of spirituality. So the majority does.

Q717 and Q718 deal with belief in afterlife and belief in God. Very few people belief in afterlife, which is understandable. Many religions do not possess an afterlife, even some Christian ones. Belief in God, however... we have 48.8% of people that are at least somewhat sure that God exists. It is not an absolute majority, but if you ignore those that refused to answer, didn't have an opinion, or are unsure, you're hardly able to attain a majority of atheist opinion.

Questions 756, 757 and 758 deal with believe in Bible. We have 52.9%, 56.4%, and 54.6% of people that believe in the Bible being inspired by God, respectively. The majority does.

So, I think the majority is still religious, sorry. As the website you linked said itself, 51% do not possess *a religion* but not possessing a religion hardly equates to being *an atheist*. You can be deist, theist or non-denominational, and you would not possess a religion and still not be an atheist. As I said in my first reply, the only way that atheists can claim a 'majority' is by conflating atheism with non-denominational and agnosticism. Had you said that there was a majority of 'non-religious' people, I'd have agreed with you, as I said it myself in the first reply. But a majority of *atheist* is deceiving atheist propaganda.

Interestingly enough, the questions 800 and 801 ask if people believe if religion is increasing or decreasing and if it is a good or bad thing. The majority believes that religion is decreasing, and the majority believes that *this is a bad thing*. Telling.

So there. Again, you're free to peruse the questionaire yourself and make up your own conclusions. As far as I could gather from it, it does not support your statement.

&gt; I wonder, though, why you try to keep those two separate.

Philosophy considers the distinction to be important. If you don't believe me, ask on /r/philosophy.

&gt; You can say all you want that humans have a predisposition towards explanations (and thus religion), but I take that a step further and say that humans have a predisposition towards true explanation (and thus science).

No, they don't. Selection Bias, Confirmation Bias and Cognitive Dissonance are important parts of how the human mind work, and they completely disregard truthness. The human mind selects for explanations that increase your survival fitness, not for true ones.

&gt; I would love to hear Dawkins give his ideas about the topic; if you can find the source where he states his agreement with you and gives a full argument for it, then I would be more than happy to read it.

[Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme#Religion). Read the linked topic on Evolutionary Psychology of Religion too.

&gt; His claim that ""Conduct, deprived of its religious supports, deteriorates into epicurean chaos"" is completely unsupported.

Durant wrote 11 books dealing with the whole history known of mankind when he was alive. To call his conclusion ""completely unsupported"" is blatantly ignorant and preposterous.

&gt; I would love to know of a single country that has fallen chiefly due to a lack of religion.

It is not a lack of religion but a weakening of religious values. I suggest googling ""Sir John Glubb"" ""The Fate of Empires"" for a short work on rise and fall of civilizations and some examples (short when compared to Durant or Toynbee works).

&gt; There is a massive amount of conflict between science and religion.

No, there isn't. The Catholic Church was the bastion of science until the middle 20th century. Not only the Church sponsored the scientific advances since the fall of Rome, but the Academia and Universities as well, and almost all notable scientists until 20th century were priests, the last notable mention being Mendell.

&gt; this part is true, but this part is a metaphor. At what point does that distinction end?

What does it has to do with the topic at hand, that is, the conflict between science and religion? I am sorry, but your red herring will go ignored.

&gt; Science has proven almost everything said within all three Abrahamic religions to be wrong,

Really? Make a list. Get everything said withing all three (sic) Abrahamic religions in a list and compare with another list of things that science has proven wrong. Let's see if it lives true to the label of ""almost everything."" Or if it is just more unsupported atheist propaganda (hint:it is).

&gt; In most first-world nations it is. In nations that have the industrial and educational backgrounds needed to adequately teach and certify their youth, the amount of non-believers is growing while the amount of believers is diminishing. Just because the numbers are growing much slower in the United States doesn't mean it isn't happening here, too. You claim it isn't, but you have yet to supply any data for your assertion.

Quite the opposite. I remember clearly stating that secularism (not science, *secularism*) is increasing in both US and Europe, while religion is increasing everywhere else. Saying that science is increasing is stupid as science is a field of work, not an ideology. Science increases when more people become scientists, not when they abandon religion.

The idea of 'first world' nations is a biased one. It steems from the idea that democratic nations are inherently superior to other ones merely because they are democratic. Today the world is divided between developed nations, nations in the process of developing and non-developed nations. Your claim is not supported by evidence. Not only the USA education system is *laughable* but also mere availability of information means nothing. One still has to learn it. China and India are scientific powerhouses and religion is increasing there.

&gt; I'm not entirely sure what you mean by this; could you elaborate?

That culture is not progressive?

Some individuals are allergic to dairy products and even more people, particularly those of non Indo-European descent, are lactose-intolerant, leaving them unable to consume non-fermented dairy products in quantities larger than about half a liter per serving. Others, such as vegans, avoid dairy products for ethical and health reasons. Fortunately, many good sources of calcium exist. These include seaweeds such as kelp, wakame and hijiki; nuts and seeds (like almonds and sesame); blackstrap molasses; beans; figs; quinoa; amaranth; collard greens; okra; rutabaga; broccoli; dandelion leaves; kale; and fortified products such as orange juice and soy milk. An overlooked source of calcium is eggshell, which can be ground into a powder and mixed into food or a glass of water. Cultivated vegetables generally have less calcium than wild plants.

To be honest though, you might want to try and mix things up - try some steak or pork, instead of chicken every day. Try out beans, lentils, bean sprouts, ""fake"" bacon, veggie burgers, etc. Explore different-colored vegetables, and try out stirfries with them. Use olive oil, for a bit of healthy fat. It sounds like you might be restricting yourself too much, and maybe denying yourself good nutrients along the way. The ""experts"" do recommend eating lots of different colors of vegetables and fruits, maybe you should try checking out red bell peppers and carrots and eggplants - eat the rainbow! Think about the Kashi commercials, there's all this exotic food out there that we haven't even tried before - explore a bit! 

Also, ""low-carb"" doesn't necessarily mean ""no-carb."" Maybe you should allow yourself some carbs one meal a day, to keep your spirits up. It's an option, anyway. 

Here on r/loseit, people will tell you to eat like you're going to eat this way your entire life. If you go low-carb for awhile and lose weight, that's great. But if you go back to your old eating habits, that might put you back to square one. Try and find a balance with your eating, and develop good consumption habits. That's what will last you a lifetime.

I don't think there's much evidence for this at all. The traditional Inuit, Masai, Tokelau all have sky-high saturated fat consumption, and little to no metabolic disease (heart disease, diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, cancer). They are all insulin-sensitive, or they were until some of them began adopting European eating habits. 

&gt; Until we get a couple of thousand healthy twenty-year-olds locked up in metabolic wards for sixty years or so for a really vigorous diet trial, I think saturated fat AND carbs (especially starchy carbs) stand out as things to reduce in the diet, in exchange for vegetables, fruit, lean protein, **and PUFA** (and probably MUFA) as things to maintain or increase.

This is exactly backwards. High PUFA consumption is generally outside of the evolutionary history of humans. It's only in the last century or so that the industrial production of seed oils (corn and soybean, predominantly) allowed humans to consume as much as &gt;10% of their calories from PUFA, and the great majority of it as omega-6.

Historically, PUFA consumption was probably more like 4%, with a ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 between 4:1 and 1:1, on average.

Higher PUFA consumption leads to greater risk of systemic inflammation and oxidative damage. 

There is no good reason to increase PUFA consumption. ",0,science,False

&gt;The methanol produced by the metabolism of aspartame is absorbed and quickly converted into formaldehyde and then completely converted to formic acid.[53] The methanol from aspartame is unlikely to be a safety concern for several reasons. The amount of methanol in aspartame is less than that found in fruit juices and citrus fruits, and there are other dietary sources for methanol such as fermented beverages. Therefore, the amount of methanol produced from aspartame is likely to be less than that from natural sources. With regards to formaldehyde, it is rapidly converted in the body, and the amounts of formaldehyde from the metabolism of aspartame is trivial when compared to the amounts produced routinely by the human body and from other foods and drugs.[7] Ingesting aspartame at the 90th percentile of intake would produce 25 times less methanol than would be considered toxic.[53]

Here's a recap of events so far today.

• Brega and Ajdabiya have reportedly been bombed by Gaddafi's forces as troops loyal to the Libyan leader continue their bid to reclaim towns and cities controlled by anti-Gaddafi demonstrators. Reuters reported that the airport in Brega was targeted, while strikes in Ajdabiya were aimed at forces massed at the city's western gate. No casualties were reported.

• The ICC has launched a full investigation into the bloody crackdown in Libya. ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said there were people with ""de facto authority"" responsible for the violence, but only identified only Muammar Gaddafi by name. He also referred to Gaddafi's sons and the Libyan leader's ""inner circle"". Earlier there were reports that three of Gaddafi's four sons Saif al-Islam, Khamis Muammar and Mutassim would be investigated.

• Three Dutch marines are being held by Gaddafi's forces, a Netherlands defence ministry spokesman said. The marines were captured as they attempted to rescue two European workers near Sirte on Sunday. The three were surrounded by armed men after landing near Sirte in a Lynx helicopter from the navy ship HMS Tromp, which was anchored off the Libyan coast. The two Europeans whom they had attempted to rescue have been handed over unharmed to the Dutch embassy in Tripoli and since left Libya. A spokesman for the Dutch defence ministry said officials were in ""intensive negotiations"" with Gaddafi's government over the marines release.

• Venezuela's president, Hugo Chavez, has proposed a ""committee of peace"" to mediate between western countries and Gaddafi. Venezuela communications minister Andrés Izarra said Venezuela's president, who has forged close ties with Gaddafi and refused to condemn him for his crackdown on protesters, spoke on Tuesday with the Libyan leader. Al Jazeera reported Gaddafi had agreed to the proposal that his opponents rejected it. Venezuelan foreign minister Nicolás Maduro said the creation of such a bloc could help resolve the conflict in Libya, adding that his government felt diplomacy – rather than military threats – should be used to end the violence sweeping the north African nation.",0,DemocracyWatch,False

It would be the same as any person concluding that the Westboro Baptist Church represents all Christians, and judging them accordingly.

Also if anyone would like to take any religion literally, the Islamic faith is actually fair in many regards, and it requires a certain logic that does require faith, but even so it does offer a very fair system within a certain lifestyle that it encourages. A conservative lifestyle.

Now if you are going to actually look at Islam fairly by its followers, and not trying to take its verses out of context or try to offer bad interpretations or take non-existent proofs of the prophet Mohamed ( there is no proof that his wife was 9 years, and actually there is more supporting evidence that says she is much older-- regardless this was a long time ago)..... the followers of Islam are as diverse as any other followers of the Christian religion for example. There are people who are gay, liberal, conservative, and also those who mix their own cultures and religions with Islam.... and they are all Muslim. (except for the gay Muslims (imo), I have a hard time seeing the point or seeing how it is compatible, but in fact there are gay Muslims in the Arab world.

If you saw a priest, rabbi, or a nun who wear their holy clothes then it would be the same to judge them as extremists. The traditional clothes of a Muslim represents how a person totally submits to God. They are like the Nun's, Priests and Rabbis of their religion by following a strict religious code, and exactly the same the Nun, Priest and Rabbi also totally submit to God.

Of course these people at the protest are not concerned with what is actually going  on, and are convinced by negative impressions that these people are bad.

So if the son, who is a marine decided to become a priest, would that be too extreme for her? 

There is almost no difference, other than the generalization of her assuming that religious Muslims are evil. The religion actually encourages them to be very peaceful. In fact it requires them to even respect someone who rejects their faith.

There is a lot of negative prejudice associated with the Muslim traditional clothes it seems. They are conservative and that is all it really represents. It does not mean they beat their wives, and it does not mean that the man takes away the rights of his wife.

Then again, if we began to take other religions literally, we should not only focus on Islam. The reason here really is because of the Arab association of Islam, which is a foreign religion and not a European Christian religion in America. So to her it is a Christian White America that she is defending, or really it is not fair for her to start with Islam if she were an Atheist.

There was a lot of negative misinformation to help with this negative impression that fueled this protest. I hope these protestors can see that Muslims are very diverse, and hopefully she can learn to trust the religious looking people, as much as she would trust a religious Priest or Rabbi.

A simple test to any Muslims to know if they personally (if a person says no, that does not mean others will as well, and only the person who says should be criticized--also it might be a bit unfair to ask anyone since they might not have thought it through) deserve to be criticized in America. Ask them if they believe that their Quran states that any good Christian or any good Jew will go to heaven just the same as any good Muslim. It is written in the Quran that all good followers of one God will be going to heaven. (This may also be open to interpretation to include more religions)

However, to collectively punish them is not fair. To put them on trial by your own decision lacking evidence is not fair. You did not do that to other religoius people.

They are supposed to be American protesters. They should do some research, and also importantly do a proper investigation. America is suppose to be a modern and rational state. How is it rational to jump to conclusions and assume everyone to be evil. Also why would anyone embarrass these people and themselves without the proper investigation. 

(treat non-believers with respect) http://www.submission.org/suras/sura60.html I recommend to visit http://www.submission.org (a good place to see a good interpretation of Islam)

[60:8] GOD does not enjoin you from befriending those who do not fight you because of religion, and do not evict you from your homes. You may befriend them and be equitable towards them. GOD loves the equitable.

[2:62] Surely, those who believe, those who are Jewish, the Christians, and the converts; anyone who (1) believes in GOD, and (2) believes in the Last Day, and (3) leads a righteous life, will receive their recompense from their Lord. They have nothing to fear, nor will they grieve.

edit: This is a late update, and this is more for me to remember, and for those who might have misunderstood what I meant: I said Islam is meant to encourage a conservative lifestyle, and said that even the non-conservative can be considered Muslims except, imo homosexuals.

The reason why other non-conservative people can be considered Muslims is because it is not fair to force our own interpretation of a certain way onto others, since in my own mind I will have different interpretations than even those who would think similar to me. So there are many forms of conservationism. Also we are not born conservative, and for this reason there should be no compulsions in religion when it comes to a specific religious compulsion. (However it becomes complicated for those who are religious as a majority and want to preserve their life style--philosophy, and doubt keeps the zealots in check, which ironically allows them to be better Muslims-- as responsible adults)

Another important point is that we all are struggling to become a better version of ourselves, and we may chose a certain religion for that. So in Islam that better version of ourselves is a conservative version of ourselves, and since we all have different interpretations, and life experiences then we also have different ways of how to accomplish that. If we completely exclude anyone out of our own specific definition of what is a perfect Muslim, then we are left with a very small group which could end up the size of a family. However, imo, why I said that a homosexual can not be considered a Muslim is because their lifestyle even though is liberal much like a person having a girl friend, but it is considered a greater failure on their part to be a Muslim compared to a person who has a girl friend. This is from a religious perspective. Also it implies the public appearance of someone showing their sexuality and how it is judged-- religion does not mean because you feel a compulsion to be gay that you are excluded from being Muslim it only means that your challenge would be that much greater to resist the temptation. If a person were homosexual but kept it private then they would be no more guilty than the person who was flirtatious. However, when a person admits to be gay, then it is as if they gave up on their conservative religion. There is some hypocrisy, but it is pretty much saying one is worse than the other. Mostly because a person who has a girlfriend may appear to be married. Also, Islam does not allow gay marriages so that option is not considered plausible since the idea of homosexuality is when a friend lusts after another friend rather than just being friends.  Again, this is from a religious perspective and why it targets the homosexual because they are a strong example of a lack of conservatism.

The problem with a conservative style which is reinforced by religion is how people get proud in their absolute truth and leave no room for error, or other lifestyles and they become hypocrites and enforce God's law upon others when they do not have the right to do so. But also equally it becomes a delicate situation to preserve a certain lifestyle and drawing out lines that have to be drawn. Each society is different, and they are willing to allow certain exceptions because of a certain logic in mind, however others will not take the risk when they fell too much is at stake.

So in a way, if a liberal person in his own way is struggling to become a conservative Muslim can be considered a Muslim, then also in a certain regard a homosexual struggling to resist his temptations can be considered a Muslim as well. However, what I just did know is opened the definition to something that has become unacceptable to many. This is why religious people are fanatics and do not like to open up their definitions to allow for other exceptions, but at the same time they are unrealistic and prefer to keep things simple. So being realistic, we say that God created us all, but for some their struggle is not as easy as for others. Maybe someone needs to have a girl friend to be happy. Without their happiness they can not be believers. So it is complicated when considering the details of many struggles to be Muslim, rather than a religious conservative trying to force their lifestyle without any consideration. Since forcing faith, would mean the forced person would only claim to be a believer but personally lack the faith but pretend to have it out of fear or shame.

1. Libya's proven oil reserves are the largest in Africa - making it a prime target for a false flag event as described in my hypothesis.

2. Libyan's quality of life is among the highest in Africa (free healthcare, access to clean water, age expectancy of over 70, poverty rate of under 8%) - which would indicate that riots are not particularly as likely as Egypt, where there is genuine poverty.

3. [There are first hand reports from Libya and Bahrain](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ft9vv/this_is_going_to_sound_insane_but_i_think_america/) that our media is not telling us the truth about the protests (scroll down a little to see the one from Bahrain). Also it seems that the media may have been [caught in a lie about the air strikes](http://rt.com/news/airstrikes-libya-russian-military/).

4. The UN Security Council [""granted broad immunity from war crimes prosecution for the mercenaries responsible for many of the bloodiest massacres against the pro-democracy protesters""](http://news.antiwar.com/2011/02/27/us-measure-ensures-gadhafi-mercs-immune-from-war-crimes-prosecution/) - which was at the US' request. This could indicate that the US is planning to send, or has already sent, mercenaries to Libya.

5. Gaddafi has support in Libya from many Libyans; something the media barely, and grudgingly report. See [here](http://www.reuters.com/news/video?videoId=190592397&amp;feedType=VideoRSS&amp;feedName=TopNews&amp;videoChannel=1&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+reuters/USVideoTopNews+) and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebA6qUoH2h4).

6. [The US and EU are planning](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-27/qaddafi-asset-freeze-approved-by-un-as-rebels-declare-provisional-regime.html) sanctions against Libya and the freezing of Gaddafi's assets. [There is even a report that the US already has troops in Libya](http://www.prisonplanet.com/report-us-special-forces-arrive-in-libya.html). An invasion by the US (and allies) is looking likely.

7. I'm not the only one who is suspicious. Two world leaders are speaking out - see [here](http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/03/01/libya.venezuela.chavez/index.html?hpt=T2) and [here](http://www.rferl.org/content/article/2324460.html)... And [from a politician in Bahrain](http://en.rian.ru/world/20110224/162745211.html).

8. The US has done this before, in Iraq, except that time the lie was WMDs. In that instance, the media was thoroughly compliant, and many civilians were completely fooled. Since that time, not many people have gotten much smarter. The same people who were fooled before can be fooled again. ",0,conspiracy,False

Provide a single example where competition has lowered wages or quality of products.

You won't be able to because it doesn't, monopolies do.

What you speak of with corporations colluding together and setting prices is what is called an ""oligopoly"" and not a single one has been able to exist without the government interfering with the market.

Look at Walmart, look at what they do to their employees.  Do they have any real competition?  They dominate their industry.  They push for lower quality products.

You know why they are able to sell those lower quality products?  Because of less choice in the market.  Their customers have to buy it.  If they had a choice, they would choose the higher quality products for the same price.  Walmart doesn't lower their prices as much as you think and that's what monopolies do.  They destroy consumer choice, they then lower the quality of the good and maintain the same prices.  Read what I'm writing to you carefully, this isn't made up.

Innovation isn't the sole property of competition but it *is* driven by it.  If you have a monopoly on an industry (whether government based or private) you have no motivation to innovate.  Why should you?  Innovation won't give you any edge, you already have the edge.  Higher quality won't give you any edge either.  You won't spend money on increasing quality or research and development, you will spend it on programs to secure and maintain your current monopoly.  Why should you pay your employees more?  What are your employees going to do if you pay them less?  Are they going to go to another company?  They really can't, they have less choice but if there was competition, there would be more options for them.  These are a bad investment for a monopoly since the higher wages, innovation or high quality won't increase your market share, it will just cost you money, money you could spend on buying politicians to give you more government subsidizing of your business, streamlining your profits.

Want to see this in work?  Look at all the European and Canadian medical industries.  Note, everyone lauds them for their compassion and the efficiency with which they work and while that may be debatable, one thing is not, they do not innovate.  All the major advancements in medicine come from the US almost without exception.  Now that being said, while there *is* competition in the US medical industry, it's not enough.  There are only a couple companies and they are protected through regulation and patent law.

Why do we allow them to own an idea?  Why do we give them patents?  An idea isn't a physical thing, you can't hold it or touch it, you can't simply show it to someone and keep them from using it.  If you have land, diamonds, gold or some other commodity, you can show that to someone but you can stop them from taking it.  It's rival and excludable.

It's rival: if I give some to this guy, I am now out the exact amount I gave him.

It's excludable: I can hold it back and when I give them an exact amount, they have that exact amount.

Now this may seem elementary but it's important to note because it *is* elementary and crucial to understanding property.  Here's the point, ideas do not have these qualities, they are:

Nonrival: if I give someone an idea, I don't lose that idea.

Nonexcludable: I can't hold it back and when I give it to someone, there is no exact amount and he can then give it to as many people as he likes, I have no control over it.

An idea can only be yours as long as you keep it a secret.  But our government gives out these little documents to these companies saying they OWN these ideas.  It's bullshit.

Governments and the corporations hold hands stomping on the road made of your potential, money and dreams.

Your teachers may tell you that government can be used as a great equalizer, they are right, it equalizes everyone regardless of their potential.  You don't strike me as a dumb person, why should the children and grandchildren of the gifted from two generations ago, who aren't as naturally talented or intelligent as you (their antecedents may have been but they aren't), be given dominion at the cost of your potential?  Why do they get to throttle competition?  Do they (the children and grandchildren of the automakers and oil barons) have any interest in seeing advanced electrical vehicles?

If you haven't, I suggest you watch a couple **very** entertaining video documentaries I think you'd like:

downsize your existing lifestyle and needs, this is actually really easy if you're not into the consumerist american bullshit

that's your ticket to freedom, you have a much better shot than most people plus you can make a good income.

start saving money now. get a job that allows you to 100% telecommute. you may need to temporarily relocate or at least interview in the bay area, although there's a lot of opportunity in nyc &amp; boston too. i'd land the job in one of those tech hotspots, the salary will be high which will allow you to live anywhere you want.

the big downside to telecommuting from hawaii and central america is the time change, you'll potentially have to wake up 6 hours early to be on east coast time, getting a job that doesnt care about hours or based from the bay area might be better to suit this.

hawaii is very reliably livable, if you make 50k/year (low for a developer) you can live comfortably in hawaii. central america is much cheaper and you'd be able to live well with western conveniences on 20-30k/year, but it's still the developing world so things like clean water, high speed internet, reliable electricity, and safety arent as guaranteed. both locations youll meet a lot of great people who are likeminded and choosing lifestyle over the bullshit.

&gt; What are my options, folks?

southern california, hawaii, central america, south america, southern europe

&gt; What would you do?

read up on places that suit your lifestyle, plan a vacation to scope potential locations, save up for a year, get a telecommuting gig, and get the fuck out of nyc.

Why is their portrayal as blood thirsty, deep in superstition primitive pople so wrong?... well, first of all, the first spanish accounts of their arrival tell of a clean, majestic citiy that shinned in the middle of the water, some thought they were dreaming as they had never seen so much colour in a city with pristine waters around it (in a time were in Europe, drinking water in cities could had been fatal). They had schools (some subjects where reserved for royalty but thats another story), craftsmen, commerce, and Hospitals, which kill the myth of people only focused on myths and legends. As revelead in the books of Chilam Balam and other archeological sources they diagnosticated more illnesses than Europeans at the time, including psycological; such as allucinations, dementia and more, from that book aproximately 800 hundred medicinal recipes have been acknowledged. Not to mention agriculture, astronomy, architecture and advanced mathematics.  

Also they did know about the wheel, many wheeled pull toys have been uncovered and can be seen at museums in mexico and other places. Some atribute the fact that  they didn't use it or developed this technology because they had no strong animals to pull Carriages if they were to build them, coupled with their prefered and efficient method of transportation the canoe trough rivers, specially in the jungle.

as a former NYer now SFer for NYC i recommend making a lot of friends who are into whatever you're into.  you need a local guide to find anything but the most obvious stuff and you'll want some peeps to do it with you.  

NYC people aren't hard to get to know, like some would stereotype, but they are more real than other parts of the country.  interested in actual conversation not just empty talk.  bring your real self and represent it there and you'll do great.

SF is the opposite in many ways, fake works great here, talk is full of air.  it is fucking amazingly beautiful, the nature within easy reach is some of the best in the country, so plan lots of outdoorsy stuff.  You must do highway 1 north, preferably on a motorcycle but if you insist on peddling... the parks in the east bay, then further out, big sur, tahoe, etc.  hint: big sur is public land open to camping anywhere, no reservations needed BUT if it's marked closed for risk of fires don't fuck around, they'll find you and deport your ass. 

oh, and yes, the green IS great out here and pretty much legal.  if you enjoy it, you have a treat to look forward to. 

BUT here is the real insiders tip worth its weight in gold.  campouts (i think you call them festivals)  they're brilliant.  anywhere from several hundred to several thousand go to the middle of nowhere for a few days of the best in dance, downtempo, dub and other electronic-leaning music.  

the w. coast has an unbelievable music scene, NYC is really great in a different way, I *love* the NYC music scene but here it's over the top... for campouts look for lightning in a bottle, raindance, um... some others escape me, oh, the huge one is cochella but... it's not the same thing really.  

Campouts or renegades sponsored by friends and family, acid totem, false profits and nexus.  brass tax and opulent temple.  all summer long, all culminating in, and please, please believe me, I've taken many europeans here (plus my wife is parisian and she can testify to it), please ignore anything negative you've heard, any preconceptions good or bad, even if you only like opera and the ovre of danny devito, if you do nothing else stateside, seriously, go to burning man.  

it's not hippies.  it's not ravers or orgies or artgeeks or ... ok it's all that but it's something more. completely unique in the world (i say this with some knowledge of many unique things in the world).  and listen, I swear it's true, everyone who has ever gone to burning man couldn't go.  really.  EVERYone who goes has overcome something they thought was impossible to make it.  so.  no excuses.  

you have to find a group to camp with, hang out in SF a bit, go to a campout if you can, it's easy to meet people here so just chat folks up and you can find a group to camp with.  that is VERY important.  but more important is just go.  

you can thank me later.

good luck

Again, as much as I would not have gone into Iraq I think it will be a better place in the end. You could always say well it would have happened eventually but I don't think so in Iraq because Saddam crushed protest with mass murder. He needed to go I just didn't want to be the one to pay for it, but in the end it's our fault he rose to power and we should have some obligation to remove him or help the poeple of that nation do so.

Afghanistan I have less hope for but at this point we invested a lot of time and some money.

Those two wars cost about 1.1 trillion dollars so far. 800 billion for Iraq and 300 billion for afghanistan. 

I think there is a good chance, though perhaps falsely, history might view our invovement in the middle east as a potential catalyst for this Arab uprising. If Iraq turns out a democracy history books will say the US seeded democracy in the middle east. I'm not saying it's true but I'm saying beside oil we might wind up with some positive spins on our involvement.

I think the causes are sound but the initial management was horrible by the end of Bush's administration it became obvious we had adapted our strategies and that in itself could be useful if we are put in a position where we feel obligation to incite regim change, though again in general I don't really wan to pay for such things esp while in debt.

I'd like to see Iran topple, but I don't know that Iranians are ready to fight a potentially brutal civil war and US invasion in that case would only unite the government and rebels.

In the case of Iraq the people wanted out but felt they had no options had China and Russia not blocked UN efforts we'd all probably view the Iraq war different and it would have been better managed I'd hope. 

Afghanistan is similar they don't want the Taliban there but they are very poor and mostly helpless to do anything about it and we did screw their nation up years ago. It's our fault groups like the Taliban are armed, well ours and Russia and our strategies of the past where we armed rebel groups is a direct result in how screwed up Afghanistan is, so again Russia and the US should feel some obligation to these people and certianly innocents die in war but they die when you allow decades of oppression to go unchecked when the UN could step in and remove these people ruling by mass murder. The different between the US killing innocent is we aren't doing it to rule them, we are doing it in an effort to remove violent tryany. Nobody likes war when it's happening but and predicitng the outcome is impossible, but it can lead to a better situation and in many cases has. 

I'm willing to let it go a little longer that 100 billion really isn't that much money 1 trillion over 10 years isn't a lot for war. It's the military budget that bothers me and yes the lack of national health care hurts us financially to the tune of about 1 trillion per year.

The question is what does 100 billion more for war have to do with the housing crash and national health care? I don't see a conneciton. We didn't fail on a public option because we lacked 100 billion dollars or because we are at war. We failed because of media monpolies siding with the GOP and corporate power paying for anti health care propaganda. People lost their homes because the GOP congress and Bill clinton repealed banking regulation and then Bush and Greenspan kept trying to stimulate the economy when it should have been in a natural bust cycle. 

100 billion dollars a year would not change these things.. we pay that in corporate subidies every year. We pay 250 billion per year for the Bush tax cuts. The war is not really the fiscal problem you think it is. 

Today's upper tax bracket is 35% (and they wind up paying around 20%). In the 80s the upper tax bracket was 50% before Reagan lowered it and BOOM we started sinking into debt. In the 70's it was 70% in the 60s it was as high as 91%

It's not our spending.. its the our continual lower of taxes on the wealthy plain and simple. 

We really need to stop thinking spending is the key problem here. We are subsidizing the rich and then worried about cutting programs that mostly employ or benefit the middle class. Don't endorse spending as the problem and focus on raising taxes because lets face it that is the only possible scenario that will get us out of debt and it's the same one we've used for decades without failure. On top of that the nation was a far more dominate force back in the 60s and 70s when we had high taxes on the rich and tarriffs on cheap foreign labor. Then Reagan and the republican revolution happened everything went global, taxes on the rich were slashed, the wealth gap exploded and market monopolized and now basic supply and demand has be circumvented by consolidation of wealth and limiting of choice.

I mean cmon we had non profit community rated health care in the 60s and we still can't get a system that good put back into place while the EU blows by our GDP and we naively waive our American flags in ignorance and false pride of just how infalible a nation we are. 

Wars are ugly but they are not, by any means, the main problem with this country. In fact those problems are very small compared to the consolidation of wealth and real implications a media monopoly poses to a capitalist democracy. We need higher taxes on the rich and all out war on monopolistic business practices and do that we need a strong leader who can unite the American middle class and has no loyalty to corporate America, but can somehow get elected. As soon as I figure that one out I'll tell you guys, but I think a person with good charmisa and strong speaking skills and morals could pull it off. You can win the US Presidents just on public funding. Obama is just a fraction of what you could expect from a charimatic speaker or a truly intelligent leader with the balls to stand up to corporate American. We need to find another recovering alcoholic in a wheel chair who's seen rock bottom and come back from it and make him President and let him stand up ans say:

""Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for me—and I welcome their hatred.""

Or maybe in today's society we need a ex WWE guy who injured his knee come out in a wifebeater with a slight limp and say BRING IN ON bitches !!

He has authored dozens of books. Listen to him speak, and it is clear that he is quite brilliant. He's just, you know, an asshole.

Well Gingrich also went to college in the 1960s.  At that time, admissions were nowhere near as competitive as they were today.  He likely did the history PhD to avoid Vietnam.  I'm sure he is a sharp guy, but I think he is more of a Karl Rove-style crafty smart than an intellectual giant.

&gt;Somebody is gonna come out of left field and win the GOP nomination. Maybe Huntsman or a Republican Governor with a fresh face. Either way, whoever it is is gonna lose to Obama. Badly.

That is my feeling as well when I saw that Thune announced he wasn't going to run.  2016 could be the best shot for the Republicans, especially since the Dems don't really have a solid candidate waiting in the wings.

I was looking at the Senate races in 2012, and it looks like, with almost absolute certainty, the Republicans will take the Senate.  Almost all of the Republican Senators up for re-election are in safe seats, and many of the Democrats barely won and are in swing/conservative states (Wisconsin, Nebraska, Virginia, Montana, Ohio).

Regardless of any policy proposals, 2012 does not look good for the Dems (aside from the presidential race).",0,politics,False

They get a flat in Utah, one guy leaves to get help, comes back and the truck is surrounded by cops.  One of the product names was ""Hijack"" and there was an office with programmers in Russia, so there were wire payments going to there.  This was after the Oklahoma city bombing when people were a little twitchy, but nothing like after 9/11.  Well, these cops call the FBI thinking they uncovered some big terrorist cell.  The FBI unloads an 18 wheeler worth of crap, and keeps these drivers shackled and handcuffed for about 18 hours while they interrogate them and inspect everything in the truck with bomb sniffing dogs.  This could have been cleared up in an hour with a phone call to have a local agent visit our offices.  It was a publicly traded company, so it's not like it was a little office with one or two people to talk to.  The FBI has some bright people, and some total morons in their ranks.  

I'm sorry that you left because of the harassment you experienced.  I have friends who had lots of negative experiences right afterward because they are from middle eastern and African countries, or look like they are.  It took about a year or two for the bigotry to calm down noticeably.  It was the worst around NY and in some of our redneck southern states.  I almost got in a few fights with people who said some nasty things.  It took me a while to realize that they were simply scared, trying to hide their fear with hate, and being stupid.  I was raised in NY and grew up with a couple of people who died in the WTC, and a couple that almost died trying to rescue people.    

I hope you get the chance to come back here someday.  There are a lot of places that I would not live in this country.  I've driven across the US, and I've driven across Europe. The US shouldn't really be one country because it's so large and so different from state to state.

California tends to be 10 or 20 years ahead of the rest of the country in some social and cultural items.  It's certainly not perfect, but what is?

Obviously bigger cities tend to be more expensive but even there it's not that much more expensive if you look hard enough.

The key with guesthouses is that often they tend to group together in specific areas so Bangkok for example has the Khao San Rd area (I normally stay a few streets back by the river). Saigon has an entire god damned quarter full of guesthouses.

So for the most part you don't need to book ahead, just find out in advance the right part of the city, or the name of a specific guesthouse that you know is in the right part of the city and aim for it.

I generally have one exception to that rule though, if there's a holiday on, then I book ahead and if I'm coming in on a long flight (12+ hours) I almost always book ahead even if I've been to the city before, because your not making your best decisions when your jetlagged and sleep deprived so it's best to make as few as possible when you arrive.",0,travel,False

What about tort law?  The US is a *very* litigious country, and so that adds more to costs as well.  Some estimates are that as much as 10 cents for every $1.00 in healthcare costs goes to malpractice insurance.  There's no ceiling on what a doctor can be sued for.  In addition, doctors are terrified at getting sued, and so they perform many more tests than are necessary.

The US does not keep electronic records, which adds to the costs.

Many US citizens are also, quite frankly, chicken shit compared to their European counterparts when it comes to their health.  The smallest cold or itch or ague leads many people to go immediately to the emergency room, which is by most estimates 6 times the cost as an urgent care facility.

Then there is the fact that individuals cannot have their own private health insurance accounts.  They have to go through their employer, who is compelled to buy insurance from a government pre-approved list of insurers.  That increases the costs.

Plus, Americans take pills for everything it seems, whereas Europeans don't.  Sleeping pills, anxiety pills, depression pills, ADHD pills, etc, etc, etc.  That increases costs.

You left out the part where the fact that we smoke less balances that out.

&gt;What about tort law? The US is a very litigious country, and so that adds more to costs as well. Some estimates are that as much as 10 cents for every $1.00 in healthcare costs goes to malpractice insurance.

Yes, some estimates say that.  [Other estimates](http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Content/Publications/In-the-Literature/2005/Jul/Health-Spending-in-the-United-States-and-the-Rest-of-the-Industrialized-World.aspx) say that we spent as little as 0.5% of our health care costs on malpractice costs.  Even allowing for ""defensive medicine"", that explains a small part of the difference.

&gt;The US does not keep electronic records, which adds to the costs.

Yes, and a big reason for this is the fact that there are significant start-up costs associated with implementing and synchronizing electronic records that no single private provider wants to undertake.  Still, I'll grant you that this could be done without nationalizing the system.

&gt;Many US citizens are also, quite frankly, chicken shit compared to their European counterparts when it comes to their health.

Source?  I think a big reason we see more emergency room costs than Europe is because we don't leave people with no insurance or money any other option.  When Reagan told hospitals that they had to treat people regardless of ability to pay, he effectively socialized our entire health care system in the least-efficient way possible.

&gt;Then there is the fact that individuals cannot have their own private health insurance accounts. They have to go through their employer, who is compelled to buy insurance from a government pre-approved list of insurers. That increases the costs.

This isn't true.  [About 60% of the population gets insurance through employers, but about 9% buy their own private health insurance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_the_United_States#Private).  I agree though, that the current employer-provided system is a mess, and we should eliminate the deduction.

&gt;Plus, Americans take pills for everything it seems, whereas Europeans don't.

Again, their health care systems play a major role in this by providing better incentives to patients and doctors.

&gt;Insurance companies cannot compete across state lines in a totally free way. That increases costs by reducing competition.

This doesn't reduce competition.  It simply allows states to pass their own insurance regulations, which is prudent until we improve our national insurance regulations.  The same major insurance companies operate in several states, just with different subsidiary companies that operate under different state laws.

&gt;The US system is so fucked up for so many reasons, that I find ""FUCK IT, LET'S NATIONALIZE IT"" a very crude and uninformed solution.

I see a lot of arguments for the viability of *alternatives* to the nationalized universal health care model, but I have yet to see your argument for that model's *drawbacks*.

I think you're confusing the issue here. If a country wanted out of the EU, would it be okay for the other member nations to use military force to coerce them into staying? What about if a member nation wanted out of the UN. 

When the United States was formed, it was conceived of as a union of independent **states**, albeit a fairly strong one. The states voluntarily joined the union, and nowhere was it specified that this decision could not be rescinded. 

Even disregarding that argument, most people believe that people have a right to self-determination.

Denmark, which is the third country on the list, is arguably the highest taxed country in the world. And most countries in the top ten are heavily taxed. Conservatives are not entitled to their own facts.

This kind of mass-aversion towards taxation seems to be almost exclusively American.

You don't have to pay sales tax on it if that company doesn't have a ""nexus"" in your state. A distribution warehouse in your state may be considered a nexus. This is part of the Amazon disagreement. But you are generally required to pay use tax to your state. States are bad about enforcing this.

If you grew up on film like I did you were happy to shed the film for something better. Here's why:

1) Better cameras - Old point and shoots had a fixed 35mm lens with no focus and no aperture control. The directions for the camera I had until I was 16 were ""Use 200-400 speed film, make sure objects are at least 6 feet away"" 

2) Film itself - Limited to 12,24,36. If you pulled too hard you lost a few frames. The camera could jam, the winding levers could jam, you could load it improperly and end up shooting nothing. Then you had no way to preview your work. When I went to Europe as a teenager I took 12 rolls of film, which had to be carried around in the little film bottles until I got back. Then I processed them at a photo mat, which cost $12 a roll. So it cost me 50 cents a picture (about) to shoot less than what I could store on a small SD card today. 

3) Labs - If you developed your own prints you did B&amp;W because color was cost prohibitive for amateurs. The chemicals involved were NASTY. I do not miss the days of fumes, rubber gloves, scratched negatives, having to do everything in the dark, only to end up with a sub standard print anyway. No thank you. 

I think you're letting nostalgia get the better of you. Take a look through most family albums from the 60s through the 90s. Virtually all birthday pictures and baby pictures are washed out poorly composed messes that have all sorts of streaks and color blotches all over the prints. And if you wanted another print you had to physically save the negative in a little envelope and take it back to the printer.

2. The existing status quo in Hollywood was really, really, really old and all carry overs from the Depression era.
3. The rise of auteur theory and in depth analysis of the designer as author and artist. 
 
The gaming industry is very very different.

School is just a name for a place where one goes to learn things; there are many ways that it can be set up (including home schooling).  There are very few education regulations at the federal level, as each state has their own standards that they require students to meet.  

A voluntary market for education is essentially what people had during the enlightenment in Western Europe. Rich land owners hired private tutors for their children, and the working class usually went wholly uneducated.  This sort of class barrier is exactly what public education is designed to minimize.

2.  Greek names =/= Roman names.  That right there is a mixed naming convention.

3.  Should a story background be based on whimsical themes, or should they reflect trends in reality?  I say reality.  The naming conventions you so love are not carried over from one era to the next, or from one society to the next.  The Romans named the planets, the Rennaissance astronomers who discovered their moons named them after greek myths, modern astronomers allow discoverers to suggest names for the structures and bodies they discover.

4.  And I always found naming conventions rather stupid, and unrealistic.  People don't know or often care about where place names come from.  They just call it what they call it.  That's how things are named in real life.  Just around my local area, there are places with Indian names (Buffalo, Chautauqua, Cattaragus,) translated Indian names (Painted Post, Horseheads), places named after places in Europe (Dunkirk, Salamanca), places named after people (Corning, Brocton), and plain descriptive place names (Forestville).  There is no committee obsessing over a single naming convention when it comes to real locations, and there never should be.

5.  There have been many other fictional solar systems in very successful works with a hodgepodge of different names of different origins.  Niven's Known Space series, just to name one.

If the author wants to reflect *reality*, he should name his worlds whatever he thinks is appropriate.  No one, author or reader or the fictional inhabitants of his world, will really give a damn about the star system's naming conventions.

For some women, sure, but this isn't the case for most women who get abortions and if you ever volunteered at a clinic, you would see this to be the case.  Most women who get abortions in the US are young (women under 24 account for 50% of all abortions in the US according to the Guttmacher Institute).  Women who have abortions are significantly more likely than the general population to be poor and not have health insurance -- when you look just at the youngest women as mentioned above, those probabilities go up even further.  Without health insurance, an abortion in the first trimester is usually about $500, give or take, depending on the area.  A vaginal birth runs $6000-8000, add another $2000 if a c-section is necessary.  The poverty line in the US for a single person living alone is about $11,000.  In other words, it can cost someone living under the poverty line almost their entire *year's* wages to simply *deliver* a child, and this doesn't include any prenatal care whatsoever, or any supplies to care for the child afterwards.  No birth control is 100% effective even with perfect use, and given the atrocious state of sex education in the US, the likelihood of perfect use is very small.  Without health insurance, hormonal BC can be difficult to come by -- this is especially true if the woman in question needs a less-generic kind of BC for medical reasons.  In this case, hormonal BC can cost upwards of $50/month.  Condoms have a depressingly high failure rate for typical use (15-20%) and women don't always have the leverage to insist that their partner wear one.  

All of these things can be changed.  We can have better sex ed, more and better birth control options, and better social services to support poor women and families.  If you look at other countries that have better reproductive health care and education (eg most of Western and Northern Europe), their abortion rates are lower than ours and their average quality of life is higher -- but they still have legal abortion.

I imagine you'd find support for self-determination of south Germans, or Corsicans, or Alaskans to be far lower. Self-determination is usually supported when the majority government demonstrates it is unable to fairly treat the minority. If the majority government is exercising its power with the support of and in the name of a group distinct from the minority in question, to the detriment of said minority, it would seem to be prudent to recognize the right. In this sense, it seems to be an extension of the right of rebellion. A right, as usually understood, that doesn't become absolute until peaceful avenues of redress have been barred to the aggrieved population. I'm not entirely convinced there even exists a right to self determination, as opposed to a right of rebellion. It seems to me to be the right of rebellion exercised by a people concentrated in a specific geographic area. The American Revolution, certainly, was justified by its authors and supporters as an exercise of the right of rebellion, at least in the Declaration of Independence.

Additionally, our own Constitution doesn't even recognize the total right of self-determination for people *within* states. In order for a new state to be formed out of an old one, the first state must grant its permission. I don't see the legal issue of secession as particularly clear cut, but even disregarding that, it doesn't follow that any of the states in question *should* have seceded. As I said before, the right of self determination, if it even exists, is closely related to or an extension of the right of rebellion, which almost always has conditions before its exercise is morally acceptable. I don't consider the condition of the American south in the 1850s and 60s to meet those conditions, though an argument could possibly be made that options to peacefully exercise their political will were rapidly diminishing, with the expansion of free states.",0,history,False

&gt;**One study has shown vegans to have higher bone fracture rates.** Luckily, the vegans in the study getting more than 525 mg of calcium had the same rates as those in the other diet groups indicating that if vegans get more calcium, they should be no worse off. Some vegans dismissed these results, but I responded by telling vegans to get more calcium.

The studies he references are the Oxford component of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC-Oxford). The American Dietitian Association’s 2009 position paper on vegetarian and vegan diets agrees with this assessment. Here it is on page 1269:

&gt;Calcium intakes of lacto-ovo-vegetarians are similar to, or higher than, those of nonvegetarians, whereas intakes of vegans tend to be lower than both groups and may fall below recommended intakes. In the Oxford component of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC-Oxford) study, the risk of bone fracture was similar for lacto-ovo-vegetarians and meat eaters, whereas **vegans had a 30% higher risk of fracture** possibly due to their considerably lower mean calcium intake. 

…

&gt;In addition, some studies show that the ratio of dietary calcium to protein is a better predictor of bone health than calcium intake alone. Typically, this ratio is high in lacto ovo-vegetarian diets and favors bone health, whereas vegans have a ratio of calcium to protein that is similar to or lower than that of nonvegetarians.

Ah, I see what you're saying.  Well, if a dictator owns a piece of land, then assuming the goal is to get a civilian to own it, then the just owner would be the people who were most victimized by the dictator, namely the civilians in the country.  But then the oil rigs and all the equipment above the ground would still be justifiably owned by whoever built it.

&gt;Remember that after WWI the victorious European powers basically carved up bits of the middle east and did a lot of horse-trading over who had what right to drill or extract from which parts.

Definitely, but then you too have to remember something, which is that without the western oil companies, that oil would almost certainly still be under the ground, because of how backwards and primitive the countries were.  They couldn't have done it themselves.  They couldn't even feed and educate themselves adequately at the time.  Multi-billion dollar oil rigs to them would have been like all your moon bases are belong to us.
