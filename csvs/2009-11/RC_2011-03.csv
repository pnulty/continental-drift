Obesity and wealth always have gone hand in hand just look back to the nobels of Europe. Fat people were almost always rich and poor people were almost always skinny. It's just simple economics. 

You facts a bunch of crap from nutball websites. 

We've been eating chemicals since the advent of chemical fertilizer... remember DDT ? Still life expectancy has done nothing but rise. 

So.. whatever unhealthy factors we have introduces we have more than offset with modern medicine. 

Veggies are the most 'disease preventative' foods out there if such a thing is actually real. The risk of eating pesticidese and hormones is simply not in way proven to be all that great. Maybe you die 10 years sooner at most. Most studies show all your good diet and exercise equate only a few extra years of life. Even smoking doesn't knock off that many years of life. It's pretty much 90% genetics and the rest is how you life your life so you can't cheat death with diet.

Diet and  bring active give you more energy and make you look better which help you enjoy life more. Genetics almost completely determine your longevity that and modern science being able to treat your cancer and heart disease which again are genetic in most cases.

I find you a sad misinformed example of humanity and obviously your need to insult other people's opinion with childish comments show your low self esteem which makes you wish you were smarter than you actually are. 

Being fat simply only has a very very minor aspect on longevity. Being morbidly obese is different but against studies have suggested slightly overweight people love longer than their counterparts. 

Paleo diet.. like most nonbalanced diets is fun but it's mostly bullshit. Not eating refined food is smart, but that is not what paleo means. Eggs, grains, veggies, fiber in general and most fruit would be very rare to find. It's basically an all meat diet if you followed it honestly. You are underestimating how inaccurate and how little data we have from this time. You can't live on bird eggs in roots you have to hunt. The amount of game back then would have been enormous. 

You also have to understand sociology. A tribe would grow as big as it's food supply and then begin to starve and it would have to move on. The process would killed dozens more as they desperately look for another spot to hunt or gather. 

Are you really going to argue that rice is not healthy? Why do asians have such a lower health disease and obesity risk. Well one obviously reason is they FUCKING EAT LESS just like your precious cavemen and that is what health is really all about.

Imagine your body is an engine and the more fuel you run through it the sooner it wears out. Being overly athletic is not a way to live longer eating 10,000 calories a day and working it off through intense training will almost always shorten your lifespan. Its about eating less and eating a balanced diet however I do agree stay away from flour, refined sugar, salt and other preservatives. However it's not truly possible to not ingest chemicals in today society. You walk outside and breathe the air or drink the water and you've ingested chemicals. You can't have a meat diet and ignore the implications on resources in a world that is overpopulated.

Either you eat veggies grown with chemicals, you eat meat with treated with chemicals or you fuel global starvation. There is no global organic food industry of any significant production level. You want meat you gotta feed the cows grain. You want that much grain you gotta use chemical fertilizer and unless you want meat to be more expensive you need modern medicine. I'm not saying it can't be improved but there is no significant link in lower longevity and chemically grown foods.

If you know anything you know organic fertilizers are the same chemicals as standard ferts and they been used for decades upon decades upon decades. If life expectancy keeps rising then your argument is almost certainly complete bullshit and in nations with better diet life expectancy is only modestly higher at best. The only argument you have is today's diet drive up medical costs, but that is really is only true in the US were we have for profit medicine. It's a fact of capitalism not increased disease from diet.

As for European social being successful, how about Greece? Socialism is great, just give everyone everything they want. The problem of course is that production doesn't always equal expenditures.

&gt; Unconstrained competition inevitably leads to monopoly or oligopoly. 
completely wrong. Competition doesn't result in monopolies. The lack of competition is what produces monopolies, the exact opposite. In addition, it usually takes the assistance of government to reduce compeititon (e.g. drug companies).

I completely agree with this statement. It's exactly what happens and it's why we are currently so screwed up. The part you left out here though is that there are actually two alternatives. One is to eliminate a free market, which you said. The other is to eliminate government (or the power that government wields). 

So now you're going to say ""we can't eliminate government, we need it bigger! We therefore have to eliminate the free market""

Fine go ahead, eliminate the market, but then the question has to be asked if you solved the problem inherent with powerful centralized government. The answer is no. Even without big business trying to corrupt government, there will still be individuals that seek power  for powers sake.

No.  You increase your price.  This is reasonable because you don't know what is going to happen to the candy bar supply--are they going to run out?--or to the candy bar demand--are people going to stop buying expensive candy bars?  That instability/uncertainty will always drive the price up, rather than down.  Also, as a capitalist, you are ALWAYS selling things as expensively as you can--that's how capitalism works.  You can't just jack up your price, or people will go buy their candy bars somewhere else--but if everyone has a reason to increase prices, you can bet your ass they will do so, whether they are motivated by fear or greed or rational business decisions.

The problem is much more systemic than a few greedy capitalists.  Within the capitalist system, greed is normal--even praised--and it is reasonable for everyone from the oil drillers to the gas station owner to economically rape you for every cent that they can.  You have no choice, because you drive a car to work, and not driving that car is not an option.  American cities are built around cars--we spent government money on roads, not on buses or trains.  If you don't like having to pay $4/gallon for gas, don't get mad at the guy pumping it--get mad at politicians for the last 4 decades, who've construction an America where it's almost impossible not to own a car.  Europe has much better public transporation--something which took alot of government effort to create--because they wanted to avoid that dependence on one single type of transportation.

It's all a popularity contest, folks. In 100 years in the future, Van Gogh might fall out of style, and his paintings might be worth $500,000, instead of the $80M, or whatever they now command.

Because it is a popularity contest, you need to do marketing. PR. Know how to sell yourself and your painting. Or hire someone to do it for you. All of have to do that. Unfortunately, people who hate this and suck at it, and they get less success because of that.

&gt;He wrote the Comedy in a language he called ""Italian"", in some sense an amalgamated literary language mostly based on the regional dialect of Tuscany, with some elements of Latin and of the other regional dialects. The aim was to deliberately reach a readership throughout Italy, both laymen, clergymen and other poets. By creating a poem of epic structure and philosophic purpose, he established that the Italian language was suitable for the highest sort of expression. In French, Italian is sometimes nicknamed la langue de Dante. Publishing in the vernacular language marked Dante as one of the first (among others such as Geoffrey Chaucer and Giovanni Boccaccio) to break free from standards of publishing in only Latin (the language of liturgy, history, and scholarship in general, but often also of lyric poetry). This break set a precedent and allowed more literature to be published for a wider audience—setting the stage for greater levels of literacy in the future. However, unlike Boccaccio, Milton or Ariosto, Dante didn't really become an author read all over Europe until the romantic era. To the romantics, Dante, like Homer and Shakespeare, was a prime example of the ""original genius"" who sets his own rules, creates persons of overpowering stature and depth and goes far beyond any imitation of the patterns of earlier masters and who, in turn, cannot really be imitated. Throughout the 19th century, Dante's reputation grew and solidified, and by the time of the 1865 jubilee, he had become solidly established as one of the greatest literary icons of the Western world.

Salient quote from the page on the [Divine Comedy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Comedy):

&gt; Dante was one of the first in the Middle Ages to write of a serious subject, the Redemption of Man, in the low and vulgar Italian language and not the Latin language as one might expect for such a serious topic. Boccaccio's account that an early version of the poem was begun by Dante in Latin is still controversial.

Good thing it isn't a slippery slope argument. If a right is inviolable, how can it be anything but unlimited absent a competing constraint drawn from another right, i.e. a right not to be harmed unless one is doing harm to another?

&gt;Positive rights are a social construct, they exist because they exist, they exist because they need to exist.

I know you know this makes no sense. Everything needs a reason for existing.

&gt;What you fail to understand in your obviously shallow, selfish, and short sighted view is that these positive rights keep you from getting your ass kicked.

No, that's a negative right.

&gt;you have wealth those others don't. They have food on their table, since the government provides this social assistance. The problem is if this system fell out of favor, if their tables went bare, it would not be long before you saw the very same degradation in social order as is being seen across the middle east and some parts of europe.

Now we're getting somewhere. So this positive duty springs from a duty I have to prevent social revolution? Interesting. I thought it was the government's job to protect my rights...

&gt;Granted much of that is due to the lack of freedoms afforded by dictatorships and such, but the lack of freedom and the lack of food share a similar bed, both reduce the ability to live ones life without hardship. Look at the number of people who rely on foodstamps. Over 40 million. Take that food off their tables, see what happens to your beloved country. Social programs, aside from being the compassionate thing to do, also are very relevant to social order.

The money doesn't come from nowhere. It comes from people like me. Fuck, maybe *I* want to revolt because my property rights are being violated. Also, if your reasoning was true, why wasn't the country in a constant state of violent revolutionary flux before the advent of the modern welfare state?

&gt;Another example is the public school system. If we took this out of the picture (it is a social program, so you don't like this, or is there some arbitrary line you've drawn?), watch what would happen to our society, our country. Most people go to public school, this would mean that most people from subsequent generations will not be educated, the country would fall to pieces.

Well, I do think we could do with privatized education...

But current political realities would never allow that.

&gt;I can explain how or why pretty much every social program in the US somehow is good for society as a whole that includes yourself.  

And I could probably provide a counter-argument for why it isn't. I don't see how this would be anything but a back and forth.

&gt;If you'd think a little bit beyond your wallet you'd see what it really is all about.

...What is it all about?

&gt;Even if for purely selfish reasons, just to make what I have to deal with day to day easier by easing the lives of those in my society, I'd do it, because the return is net positive. A healthier america, as per social medicine, ultimately reduces medical costs, since it would have an increase in preventative care reducing the more expensive late-stage care of various diseases. 

No, that would be a textbook definition of something that's not a net positive. It's a positive for only those suffering from expensive late-stage care. Aren't those people better off dying anyway? Is it *really* better to help one person live from 80 to 81 than it is to help 10 people live past 18?

&gt;TB is caught early, for example, is much cheaper to treat (by an order of magnitude) than mid-stage TB. Problematically a lot of people don't regularly get tested and often end up with it at a later stage requiring expensive treatment; most of these people are poor. You do realize that you pay for this anyhow right? I mean the hospitals are subsidized for their unpaid medical bills by the government, so whether you have it on paper as a social-medical program or not, you've been paying this for years. Now if they could go get treatment early on, you'd save millions of dollars each year, for something you'd complain about will be more expensive.

I don't think I should be paying these costs anyway. Maybe these people could actually afford medicine if the Congressional corporate whores allowed true competition between insurers and allowed costs to be lowered.

In this challenging economy you are looking into new territories, markets and industry channels, some of those may be based outside the US. Unlike most purchase order financing companies, we work with businesses seeking growth in foreign markets such as Canada, Mexico, UK and Asia. Whether you are looking for PO financing in Canada, purchase order financing in Mexico or PO funding throughout the EU, our international PO financing program is designed to assist your business to grow and expand in the global marketplace.

What is purchase order financing?

Every business faces the challenge of managing cash flow. One tool to make it easier is purchase order financing. It gives you access to working capital in a manner that is quick, convenient and affordable. Companies use purchase order funding to support an expansion, handle a large order or surge in business, and even occasionally for operating expenses. The tool is particularly well suited to newer companies that cannot get authorized for a traditional business loan. Manufacturers, distributors, importers and exporters are good examples. Lets say your suppliers want you to pay cash on delivery, but your customer won’t pay you until 60 days after they receive your finish product – a classic cash flow problem, which purchase order financing is designed to solve. Here are some other applications:

Inexperience in generating financing

Lack of working capital

Need to keep suppliers and customers separate

Desire to avoid credit risk (PO financing is not considered debt)

Immediate sales need calls for fast response

Profit opportunity

How does purchase order financing work

Purchase order financing involves issuing letters of credit to suppliers of finished or non-finished goods, based on specific, tangible goods that have been presold to a creditworthy end customer. It can help you deliver on time, increase market share, and grow without selling equity or incurring bank debt. You will need to supply financial information about your company, customer and supplier. We take care of the rest, usually offering approval and getting your short-term funding to you in as little as two weeks. You can use this cash flow management tool to meet future growth opportunities, too -once your account is set up, the process is faster still.

I played quite a lot yesterday, though (as the matter of fact I even dreamed about playing SC2 - my queen was defending the rushes all night long ;) ).

Went 8wins - 5loses. 2 of the loses were caused by me being retarded. Throwing away (literally, my positioning was THAT bad) all of my army at 200/200 pushing terran (4-5 base me vs 2 base turtle) was the first one. And second one due to 4gate toss who mass zealot'd me when I wanted to defend only with lings. Yeah good luck with that, retard! I think I lost 1 zvz game when we spawned cross position on metal, I went for roach+Lair, he went for expo-sling. My initial push failed hard and I gg'd - there were no reason to be massacred by his sling counterattack.

When I lose I feel more like *I* am losing - not my opponent winning. It is very assuring, because I know when I eliminate weak sides of my play I can get a lot of more wins.

Defended some 2rax all-ins, which is very nice, because I feel now really confident at tvz. Won some long ass macro pvz and this is even better, because my pvz was always lacking.

Why does every country on the planet have to borrow money every year ? And who are they borrowing from ? USA borrows from Europe, Europe borrows from Asia, Asia borrows from US. Have a big tally up, cancel all this ""circular"" debt, have some debt-cancellation for poorer nations like Haiti and other similar fucked up places, and then finished.

No more borrowing. You live within your means, and if you can't afford that new Flatscreen TV, or that new car, or house, or bridge, or superhighway, then you can't fucking have it ""on tick"".

It's the whole debt culture that has persisted since World War II. If you can't afford to fight a war, then don't. How simple is that. The irony is, 60 years later, the most fiscally successful country and kingpin of the European Union is ... Germany !

Sometimes I wonder what would have happened if they HAD won ? Would we all be as prosperous as they are now ? I know I'll get voted to hell for this, but it's a serious question. What is it with their culture that extols excellence and hard work and frugality ... while the rest of us are just like ""fuck it, more debt, gonna take me 100 years to pay this lot back, c'est la vie"".

Maybe the isolation from the rest of the world made them more self-reliant, more willing to use what they had rather than borrowing from everyone else ?

The Iranian Foreign Minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, said the conference sought ""neither to deny nor prove the Holocaust... [but] to provide an appropriate scientific atmosphere for scholars to offer their opinions in freedom about a historical issue.""[1] The 67 attendees from 30 countries[2][3] included the American David Duke, former member of the Louisiana House of Representatives and Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan; Austrian Jew Moshe Aryeh Friedman; Holocaust deniers Robert Faurisson, Fredrick Töben, Richard Krege, and Ahmed Rami; Canadian political science professor Shiraz Dossa; and the American Yisroel Dovid Weiss of Neturei Karta.[4]
&gt;
&gt; The conference was widely described as a ""Holocaust denial conference"" or a ""meeting of Holocaust deniers"",[5][6][7] and provoked worldwide criticism.

&gt; In a speech broadcast on IRINN on September 18 and 23, 2008, Ahmadinejad stated:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;The Zionists are crooks. A small handful of Zionists, with a very intricate organization, have taken over the power centers of the world. According to our estimates, the main cadre of the Zionists consists of 2,000 individuals at most, and they have another 8,000 activists. In addition, they have several informants, who spy and provide them with intelligence information. But because of their control of power centers in the U.S. and Europe, and their control of the financial centers and the news and propaganda agencies, they spread propaganda as if they were the entire world, as if all the peoples supported them, and as if they were the majority ruling the world.[98]
&gt;
&gt;At a Holocaust conference at Sharif University of Technology in Tehran on January 27, 2009, Ahmadinejad stated:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;""Today the Zionists dominate many of the world's centers of power, wealth, and media. Unfortunately, they have ensnared many politicians and parties, and they are plundering the wealth and assets of nations in this way, depriving peoples of their freedoms and destroying their cultures and human values by spreading their nexus of corruption.""",c1ittyp,True,t1_c1isj8x,1298990204,t3_fu97v,True,t5_2qh13,,t1_c1ittyp,2,0

------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
important polemical edit, related to the above:

differently from other american colonies,

the portuguese in brazil, screwed their black slaves, 

a lot,

hence giving them more slaves,

but in the long run, creating a substantial population of mulattos.

these latter also mixed up with the later droves of immigrants from japan, europe, an rest of asia in the last 150 yrs.

for some reason the mixing of races, in Brazil, has always been seen as natural and positive as opposed to in the US where ethnical ghettos form, and multi racial couples have a hard time.

so this explains:

1- why brazil has less racial issues than america (though big income inequality - not related to race tho),

I ask because in some LatAm countries such positions are usually used as trampolines for a higher government position in government. For instance: you're a doctor and a member of political party X so you get to be Minister of Social Security. After that position you get to be Governor of a city and then you run from president (partly finance by money and favours obtained from your previous positions). So how does Canada does it?

Professional bureaucrats (whose competence is asserted through various evaluation and selection mechanisms) are in charge; they follow established guidelines to provide services.

&gt; I hate to use the ""freedom"" argument user thened referred to but really, what if I need more coverage or if I want less? In Chile they had, at least a while ago, a system where each person handled their social security ""account"" as they would a bank account in the sense that they could see it grow in time and could choose coverage from different providers (including a public provider) depending on their needs and expectations. I've heard Singapore has a similar system so there must be some advantages to that system don't you think?

If you want more coverage, you can always buy it from insurance companies; in fact, many workers are covered by such programmes through their employers as social benefits. However, those benefits are mostly frills, so you can go easily without such coverage.

And no, you cannot have less coverage; universal means that everybody gets the same thing. It’s not a question of freedom, it’s a question of social obligation which nobody questions.

&gt; If the health-insurer is public, what do you mean that you ease the burden on social services. What services are you referring to if not health insurance?

I am talking about programs (in the US) that cover uninsured people; they necessarly cost more per capita than universal insurance because their risk pool is much worse than the universal pool.

&gt; How does the State finance this? In Europe, for instance, both employers and employees pay for social security. Are employers free from any and all health care expenses in Canada?

It is paid for through taxes by the general fund, whose income has sales, excise and income tax, as well as profits from crown corporations (the government own some entreprises that generate hefty profits — and thus decrease the tax burden for everyone).

&gt; &gt; No burden on Society, as no one can be bankrupted because he is being dumped by his insurer

&gt;What do you mean by ""burden""? The State has to financed health care from what society produces through taxes and the like right? What am I missing?

This is what I said: every bankrupcy is a burden on society, so avoiding health-related bankrupcies ultimately benefits society.

&gt; Competition usually ensures that the most efficient providers will survive while the less efficient are taken out of business. 

Competition cannot work for insurance, because the most efficient insurance is one that draws from the largest risk pool possible. This is why government health-insurance in Canada is so much efficient than in the US, it’s huge risk pool allows it to have only 5% overhead. This means that 95% of the money in the system goes to patients themselves.

&gt; By efficiency I mean they provide what the customer wants for the best price/quality ratio. 

The canadian system gives the best price/quality ratio. I mean, only 5% overhead!!!

&gt; If you don't have a market for health insurance (i.e. different providers competing for customers) then its practically impossible to know whether you are being efficient.

Sure it is, just look at the 5% overhead.

And with private insurers, the efficiency metric is the bottom-line, which totally works against the customers.

&gt; You may know whether you're being effective but without competitors you can't know whether you are incurring unnecessary expenses or wasting time etc. because you have nothing to compare it against, thus you can't measure efficiency. Well, you can compare it to international providers but since each country has different economic realities its usually not a very good comparison.

Well, in a nutshell, 5% pretty much sums up everything when you compare it to the grossly abysmal 35% overhead of the US.

The Obamacare has been criticized as being engineered to put private insurers out of business. This is a valid point, and it is actually what Canada has done 40 years ago when we decided to simply get rid of the private health-insurance companies.",c1iuqva,True,t1_c1iujvv,1299001853,t3_fuw21,False,t5_2qh1s,,t1_c1iuqva,1,0

&gt; o levou a concluir, por um breve momento, que as pessoas eram hipócritas ao ponto de conviver com os amigos na véspera de uma manifestação, pecado capital em todas as nações dignas desse nome; que todas as maldições milenares caiam sobre aqueles que se queiram divertir antes de manifestarem a sua opinião de acordo com o seu direito democrático.

És um imbecil. Esta frase não é um insulto, é antes uma constatação de facto. Na véspera de uma manifestação contra a precariedade laboral e financeira os jovens juntam-se para ""tomar uns copos"", é sob todos os prismas passíveis de ser analisada uma atitude pouco condizente com as queixas que vão expressar mais tarde. Não é coerente queixar-se de não ter dinheiro para ser independente quando se gasta tudo em luxos. Esta situação é a puta da definição de **HIPOCRISIA**. Reitero: és um imbecil.

&gt; Ainda por cima quando só têm uma taxa de desemprego muito superior relativamente à da população que não concluiu o ensino superior e que têm, não raras vezes, outra escolha senão aceitar estágios não remunerados ou recibos verdes atrás de recibos verdes... Realmente, a lata de certas pessoas.

Realmente, a lata deste país. Mais! A lata deste mundo! Estou chocado que esta inconveniência de crise global tenha gorado os planos! É inconcebível que o mundo não gire à nossa volta! Esqueçamos que o excesso de licenciados seja um problema badalado há mais de 10 anos e toda esta situação era previsivel e no entanto decidi tomar uma má decisão; EU TIREI UM CURSO E POR ISSO TENHO TODO O DIREITO DE EXERCER UMA PROFISSÃO RELACIONADA COM A MINHA ÁREA DE FORMAÇÃO ACADÉMICA! É UM DIREITO MEU!

Ou talvez não.  
Ou secalhar ninguém, rigorosamente **ninguém** te deve isso.  
  

Acorda, paspalho. Tu e os outros como tu pensam que o mundo deve adaptar-se a ti. Newsflash: fodeste-te. E vais continuar a foder-te enquanto pensares assim. Tu é que te tens de adaptar. Infelizmente quando dizes algo como isto não prevejo que mudes em breve:

&gt; e que têm, não raras vezes, outra escolha senão aceitar estágios não remunerados ou recibos verdes

Então isto é a única alternativa possível? Vocês tem um plano delineado e porque devido a uma miopia cognitiva apenas agora se aperceberam do óbvio querem mudar o mundo de modo a que se ajuste às vossas medidas? Às vezes 3 letras apenas resumem eloquentemente o que há a dizer sobre isto, e cá estão elas: **LOL**


Entrei com média de 17,9 na universidade. Friso este ponto anterior para deixar claro que não foi por falta de aptidão académica que hoje critico quem escolhe licenciar-se. Eu mesmo estudei durante 3 anos. No entanto três coisas tornaram-se nítidas:  

1. Forte probabilidade de não ter trabalho  
2. Caso tivesse emprego, a remuneração não era o que esperava  
3. Eu gosto de ter estabilidade financeira   

Obviamente decidi procurar outra solução.

A maioria dos meus colegas quis concluir os estudos e procurar emprego nessa mesma área. Acomodaram-se. Que é como quem diz em português vernacular: foderam-se. Metafóricamente estavam a guiar um carro contra a parede e em vez de saltar fora decidiram mudar a estação de rádio. 
  
Eu, por outro lado, saltei fora. Iniciei o meu negócio. Comecei com um investimento mínimo e a trabalhar a partir de casa. Volvidos 5 anos por mês ganho mais do que os supracitados ex-colegas auferem anualmente. Em alguns casos o dobro.
  
Eu não sou especial. Simplesmente não sou comodista. Não sou egocêntrico. Não acho que o mundo me deve alguma coisa. Sou apenas um cabrão cujo trunfo foi entender que se quero alguma coisa tenho que lutar para ela.  
  
Já os paspalhos que andam a tocar sarapitolas ao som de Deolinda estão convictos que se fizerem muito barulho a situação deles vai-se inverter. Mais uma vez, em jeito de remate:

WWI – We were drastically unprepared, had to buy/lease most of our heavy equipment from Britain and France (tanks, machine guns, artillery).  Most of the troops trained with wooden guns till they got to Europe and were issued a weapon.  These same troops would then fire their first shot ever with a rifle in combat, which is not the best learning environment.

Here is an evening summary.

• The idea of creating a no-fly zone over Libya is still being discussed by western countries. The US general James Mattis described it as ""challenging."" Russia's foreign minister called the plans ""superfluous"". Russia has a veto in the UN security council. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, has suggested Libya could either become a peaceful democracy or fall into ""protracted civil war."" The US began moving warships in the region in a show of force.

• Saif Gaddafi has denied there have been attacks on protesters in Libya, and said things are ""not as bad as you see from outside."" And Venezuela's Hugo Chavez came to the Gaddafis' defence, accusing the west of ""rubbing their hands over Libya's oil.""

• The EU is to hold a special summit on Libya and north Africa on 11 March. Oil prices have soared to a two and a half year high.

• There has been fighting in Zintan, 90 miles south of Tripoli, where opposition forces managed to repel the pro-Gaddafi military, as they did in Misrata, 125 miles east of the capital. Opposition forces in Nalut, 140 miles south-west of Tripoli, feared an assault from pro-Gaddafi forces was imminent.

However, I think that by then Christianity will either undergo a number of transformations as a whole, resulting in either a total transformation of the entire religion, or another major schism. One major issue I foresee all surviving denominations undergoing is a change in their stance on acceptance of homosexuals in the church. Another I see being a major divisive issue that may result in a schism is Christology being drastically lower in future churches. I'm willing to bet that more literalist and sola scriptura and sola fide churches will die off with more people embracing orthodoxy or catholicism, or at least a new denomination of Christianity that brands itself on being more tradition based than ""anyone can pick up the Bible and be inspired by God"" based.

A number of current Christian denominations will die off, only to be replaced with a number of new ones that are better equipped to handle humanity's ever-changing world view. I don't see a great future for a lot of evangelical protestant churches, but liberal and orthodox churches should do well.

The program, a protest against the imposition of martial law by a Soviet-backed régime, contained commentary from many well-known celebrities. While widely viewed in the U.S., it met with skepticism on the part of European broadcasters due to concerns that the show, ""provocative and anticommunist,"" was intended as propaganda.

Few months ago, I was discussion with some guy about economics, socialism and capitalism.

I was telling him that some state departments actually hurt the general good, instead of promoting it.

I was telling him how the central bank (the 'Federal Reserve' in the US) was an institution dedicated to help rich, politically connected firms at the expense of the general public.

He was *convinced* I was wrong, and argued tooth and nailed for 30 minutes, coming with all kinds of arguments on why I was wrong (including ""if those laws exist, it must be for a reason!"").

After 30 minutes, something came clear:  He didn't know what a central bank was (he though it was to give loans to the poor).  When I explain what a central bank did, he admitted he didn't even know we had a central bank.

Doesn't matter, he still though I was wrong.

How can you explain that?  People don't have a clue about what they are talking about, but still argue, blindly believing that whatever state institution exist is good, necessary, and we couldn't do without.

This is- in my opinion - almost entirely due to public schooling, which transformed the public opinion over decades from the public being suspicious of government bureaus, to one that believes blindly in the benevolence of the state (although not necessarily about the current administration or politicians, unless they are the right color).

The US has had two simultaneous wars in the last decade and troops stationed all over the world. The US people are driven to succeed. They take two weeks vacation a year and work eighty hours a week.

Europeans are mostly not at war with anyone and do not have large militaries. Europeans work 38 hours a week and take six weeks vacation or more a year. Europeans seek a balance between work and enjoying life. European women are often naked or topless on beaches, at parks and on TV. European men are laid back and somewhat happy.

No it isn't. If I don't hold the door open for you, I don't get ""punished"".

Since when did ""courtesy"" become lawful? o_0

&gt; back in the early 80s there was no such choice for service industry workers or patrons.

I highly doubt that, but if a characteristic of an industry is something you dislike, you might want to choose to work in a different industry.

&gt; and safety precautions exist to mitigate this risk, but it is inherent in the nature of the job. 

Just like smoking can be inherent in nature of working, say, at my restaurant. We can take safety precautions too, like installing ventilation systems.

On one hand, unsafe conditions are okay because *you* perceive them as ""inherent"" to the job. On the other hand, unsafe conditions are not okay because they don't fit your definition as ""inherent.""

&gt; see previous. when there are no choices, this is argument is a false choice.

There is always a choice between using someone else's property or not.

That I don't have the ability to grow wings and fly to Europe is not a limitation of my freedom or my choices.

&gt; because youre essentially saying that your choice to smoke overrides the rights of everyone else around you.

You aren't reading a word I'm writing. This is an issue of *property* rights. If I own property, and I want to smoke on it, I have every right to do so. Otherwise, it isn't my property. Moreover, if it is my property, I may allow others to smoke on it as well.

What you're suggesting is like me coming into your home and ripping out every television in your house because I deem it unhealthy for your mind.

&gt; this is not a fair choice as you are making the decision for others

If I went on to private property that expressly forbids smoking, and I smoked anyway, I would agree that I am in the wrong. I may even be punished for doing so. (Although, I'd just likely be kicked out.)

&gt;further, the long term damage you are inflicting on others has to be managed, either by that person on their own or by society (yes, our current system does that, as distateful as that is). in areas where smoking is allowed, it is generally allowed throughout the premises, and those segregated areas generally present an ineffective barrier. because of the profit motive, business were reticent to prohibit smoking outright, so no actual choice (ie visiting a smoke-free establishment) existed until after mandates were put in place.

I can't really understand this. Are you saying that because businesses don't do what you want, it is okay to mandate them to do so?

If we fixed public awareness of the bad side effects of smoking, and never mandated anything, I somehow doubt establishments wouldn't have banned smoking or taken better measures to segregate areas.

&gt; so your choice to smoke is disproportionately affecting everyone else around you. thats the problem - again, its the same problem as the govt regulation. a choice made by someone else negatively affecting your quality of life without an alternative.

Except you're throwing property rights to the wind, and therefore, the choices are not the same. You perceive them that way, because seemingly, you think being courteous should be a law.

It's very simple. If you don't like a characteristic of an industry or an establishment, and perceive it to be unhealthy for you, then don't work for it and don't visit it.

The Torries and the Lib Dems locked themselves away from the public and horse-traded the policies we'd voted for in exchange for ministerial cars.

I'd understand if the party made concessions but stayed true to its principals, its promises to the voters, but then the Lib Dems (arguably the most idealistic of all the parties) showed that even promises carefully worded to be irrespective of an election result, promises signed publicly by each MP, can be traded away for power if the political situation demands it.

No, I was disputing your implication in previous posts that the only reason why France has high standards of living but low levels of union membership is because they have government protections.

If a nation can have 70% union rates and still have no mandated minimum wage, then clearly having unions is not vital in getting those laws passed, especially when you can find nations with much weaker unions that both have those laws passed (UK, Germany), and ones that don't (Switzerland).

You can't say ""the only reason France has government protections on workers is because of unions"" when it has only 8% of the population in Unions (and has had among the lowest rates of union membership in Europe for decades), while 2 countries that both have over 70% members in unions have less protections.

If you want to talk about other protections, not only has France got a minimum wage AND collective bargaining for unionised industry, but they have a mandated [35 hour work week](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35-hour_workweek), a piece of law that came into being when Unions where at their weakest for 60 years.

All your arguments amount to [special pleading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading). I bring up France of an example of a nation that has low levels of unionisation and high standards of living, and you say that this says nothing about whether unions are neccesary for high standards of living, because its the Unions that were responsible for enshrining the worker protections.

Which is a weak arguing strategy. Rather than actually having to demonstrate that Unions were responsible for employee law in france, you can merely assert it is so, then you expect me to do the much harder job of disproving a negative.

After all, france has had Unions for over 100 years, and there have been many laws passed on worker regulations, therefore the Unions must be responsible! Prove they're not!

So rather than arguing from correlatory evidence as I am doing, you can just make blanket assertions and then claim intellectual superiority if I don't disprove them to your satisfaction (even though your criteria for satisfaction are extremely vague, while mine are extremely clear).

---------------------------------

I'm gonna make this simple.

[List of nations graphed by Union membership compared to Regulations on Employment Conditions.](http://www.nationmaster.com/plot/lab_tra_uni_mem-labor-trade-union-membership/lab_reg_emp_con-labor-regulation-employment-conditions/flag#details) 

As you can see, there's fuck all meaningful correlation. In fact, nations with lower union membership rates tend to have better regulations. So maybe you say this is because all the countries with strong unions don't need regulation (even though you're claiming its unions that pass the regulations). Okay, whatever.

[Now lets compare it with HDI and Union membership](http://www.nationmaster.com/plot/lab_tra_uni_mem-labor-trade-union-membership/eco_hum_dev_ind-economy-human-development-index/flag)

As you can see again, fuck all correlation between unions and HDI. In fact, if you remove the outliers of France and Norway, there's again a correlation between lower union membership and higher HDI.

In fact, in actuality Norway is only 0.001 points ahead of Australia in the HDI, even though it so it appears much higher on the graph, so their data is a little wonky (or is using out dated data).

If you'd like to use the [wikipedia page for HDI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index) and compare that to a [list of union membership](http://www.worker-participation.eu/National-Industrial-Relations/Across-Europe/Trade-Unions2), I'm sure all the people here who are interested in having their beliefs backed by evidence will thank you.

In fact, if you go one better and compile all the information available, you will have the most concrete answer possible. If you show me this information, I will agree with whatever the correlation is, whether it says Unions are good, bad, or unimportant.

However, considering the lack of interest you've shown in evidence so far, I'm not gonna waste my time tracking down all the information, compiling it just for you to tell me it doesn't matter because of some special pleading bullshit. 

-------------------------------------------------

&gt; When in point of fact, employers are obligated by law to honor minimum wages secured by unions.

There is not a nation in the western world where employers aren't obligated by law to honour contracts they make, this is an irrelevant point.

**If you're not in a industry that has collective bargaining in Finland or Sweden then there is no protection on your wages.** only 90% of Finland and Swedens population are covered in Collective Bargaining agreements. 100% of France and the UK's population is covered by the laws they have, even though they both have much weaker unions.

I dont claim a mystical knowledge of economics. Intact I have been telling you its quite simple and have pointed you in the direction of different schools and even recommended a book. I dont know about you but i dont know of any magical books that exist.

&gt; And who are you to say what is ""right""? Social welfare programs improve the livelihood of the bottom 50%. Scandinavian and European countries have virtually eliminated poverty by providing for everyone. Pensions, government healthcare, unemployment benefits, and a variety of other safety nets have ensured the incredible fruits of technological advancement are enjoyed by everyone- not just the upper 10%.

Here, all you did was claim a bunch of things. You point out that theese countries have less poverty now then before and say we have social programs now so that is the reason. Correlation does not equal causation, you need logic to back up your claims otherwise it is worthless.

&gt; These countries use mixed economies, with state control of certain industries such as energy, and tight regulation of other industries, to combat the inherent consolidation and bottom-feeding tendencies of pure capitalist markets. And they've worked very well, as opposed to the US where outside of finance our GDP has actually been shrinking the last 10 years.

Do you really think that the US is a free market? How could you possibly look at the US that has over $13 trillion dollars in debt and over $100 trillion in unfunded liabilities and say ""Oh yea thats the free market in action there"".

Barack Obama's health care bill requires you to buy healthcare insurance just by the fact that you are alive, is that the free market part of the US you are talking about?

Another area where you fall apart is if you look at the two freest economies on earth (Hong Kong and Singapore) and they are leaders of economic growth and have been eliminating poverty at a constant rate.

*They're basically addicted to the sport. Since they spend a lot of time traveling to matches the relationships they built up before they started playing professionally suffer. I doubt communication via skype/msn is enough to maintain healthy relationships with your old friends/family etc.

*The ones living in Europe are in the worst situation. They are very limited to the people who they can socialize with since they do not understand the language and Europeans aren't that great at speaking English. Life must be rly boring for them after they pass the initial phase of excitement of living in Europe.

*As I said, since they spend so much time thinking about the sport, how much common topics would they even have with other people with ""normal"" jobs/lives (jobs that don't take over your entire life like Tennis imo does). Do they even have time to watch new movies/listen to new music releases (listening to music while not playing the game)? I think they most of them would be pretty boring to talk to about anything non-Tennis related.

*One last thing. What after they stop their tennis careers? When they settle down in a certain town. When their tennisfriends all come back to their own towns/countries and stop playing. I doubt Federir is gonna socialize with his Swiss friends regularly when he gets in his 40s, he's gonna be far away in the U.K. and all the other guys are gonna live in their native countries. If these professional tennis players don't maintain their old pre-professional career friends I fear they will feel very alone when they get older and stop playing.

On direct current (DC), electrons move in a orderly fashion from the positive pole to the negative pole of the electric generator. Nothing to see here, move along. All bateries (automotive, AA, etc) provide direct current.

Alternating current (AC) is what you get from your wall outlet. The electrons move forward, then backward and so on. That cycle is repeated 60 times per second (50 times per second on Europe), which gives the famous 60hz frequency.

That may sound silly at first (why go forward then backward?), but AC has a ton of advantages over DC. Firstly, when electrical energy is generated by a turning machine (wind turbines, hydroelectric turbines, etc) it is already AC. By using transformers, AC can easily have its voltage elevated. That makes it much easier to be carried over long distances, as much thinner cables can be used to transfer the same amount of power.

Most electronic equipments use DC. But rectification (turning AC to DC) is a trivial and cheap process. In fact, it's cheaper for each and every equipment that needs DC to have its own internal rectifier than to transmit DC from the power plant.

What makes AC dangerous is exactly the fact that it... well, alternates. If a current as small as 1mA at 60hz goes through the heart (i.e. from one arm to another) there's a high risk that this electrical discharge can mess with the electrical pulses that makes the heart beat.",c1ixp1p,True,t1_c1ixjgx,1299036863,t3_fv40t,False,t5_2rjo5,,t1_c1ixp1p,8,0

The 777 matches the KC-10 extremely well in size and capability, and is ridiculously fuel efficient and reliable. The 777 has no real competitors out there, and when it came out it pretty much killed the A340, the next-best airplane of that size. In any competition of ""777 versus something else"", I can't see the 777 losing. Also, I don't think Airbus even makes freighter A340s, which means that development of an A340 tanker would be expensive, while developing a 777 tanker from the 777 freighter would be relatively straightforward.

And none of that is true of the 767 versus the A330. The A330 is a better airplane by most counts - a little bigger, a little more efficient (in terms of cost PER how much it carries, not absolute cost), a little more reliable, and not really much more expensive. 767 sales dropped quite a bit when the A330 came out and never quite recovered. An honest Boeing person will admit that the A330 is a better airplane overall. The only good reason for not picking the A330 for KC-X is that it's significantly bigger than the airplane it would be replacing.

So KC-X was quite competitive: The slightly cheaper American plane versus the slightly better European airplane. But I can't imagine Airbus concocting a better KC-10 replacement than the 777 would be.",c1ixsy9,True,t1_c1ic9o5,1299038219,t3_fs43w,False,t5_2qhad,,t1_c1ixsy9,1,0

Here is my hypothesis: The US (and allies) want Libya's oil. Their plan to get it is: Stage a revolt in Libya ... call in mercenaries to massacre Gaddafi's own people... use the media to exaggerate reports of violence against civilians by Gaddafi's troops... under the guise of humanitarian intervention, send in their military to occupy Libya and secure her oil reserves.


Supporting evidence I have amassed for this hypothesis so far:

1. Libya's proven oil reserves are the largest in Africa - making it a prime target for a false flag event as described in my hypothesis.

2. Libyan's quality of life is among the highest in Africa (free healthcare, access to clean water, age expectancy of over 70, poverty rate of under 8%) - which would indicate that riots are not particularly as likely as Egypt, where there is genuine poverty.

3. [There are first hand reports from Libya and Bahrain](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ft9vv/this_is_going_to_sound_insane_but_i_think_america/) that our media is not telling us the truth about the protests (scroll down a little to see the one from Bahrain).

4. The UN Security Council [""granted broad immunity from war crimes prosecution for the mercenaries responsible for many of the bloodiest massacres against the pro-democracy protesters""](http://news.antiwar.com/2011/02/27/us-measure-ensures-gadhafi-mercs-immune-from-war-crimes-prosecution/) - which was at the US' request. This could indicate that the US is planning to send, or has already sent, mercenaries to Libya.

5. Gaddafi has support in Libya from many Libyans; something the media barely, and grudgingly report. See [here](http://www.reuters.com/news/video?videoId=190592397&amp;feedType=VideoRSS&amp;feedName=TopNews&amp;videoChannel=1&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+reuters/USVideoTopNews+) and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebA6qUoH2h4).

6. [The US and EU are planning](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-27/qaddafi-asset-freeze-approved-by-un-as-rebels-declare-provisional-regime.html) sanctions against Libya and the freezing of Gaddafi's assets. [There is even a report that the US already has troops in Libya](http://www.prisonplanet.com/report-us-special-forces-arrive-in-libya.html). An invasion by the US (and allies) is looking likely.

7. I'm not the only one who is suspicious. Two world leaders are speaking out - see [here](http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/03/01/libya.venezuela.chavez/index.html?hpt=T2) and [here](http://www.rferl.org/content/article/2324460.html)... And [from a politician in Bahrain](http://en.rian.ru/world/20110224/162745211.html).

8. The US has done this before, in Iraq, except that time the lie was WMDs. In that instance, the media was thoroughly compliant, and many civilians were completely fooled. Since that time, not many people have gotten much smarter. The same people who were fooled before can be fooled again.

Please look at this article, as some English fellow introduced them to Japan...

Basically, no one is actually talking about an invasion and you are a rank amateur if you think they are.  NATO is talking about imposing a no-fly zone, but that has less to do with oil --Libya does have oil, but it doesn't have all that much-- and more to do with the fact that they can, easily, because there's already several NATO carrier groups in the Med.  

Second point: Libya is *way* more important to NATO than the other countries you mention not because of its oil, but rather, because of its proximity to Europe.  All hell breaking loose and massive humanitarian disasters in Libya are going to have a direct and immediately felt effect on Europe and, by extension, the larger economy of The West in general.  

Which is just to say that Western Europe (you can read that as ""NATO,"") has both the ability and motivation to immediately intervene in Libya in the ways that are currently being discussed --basically, the imposition of a ""no fly"" zone.  The same cannot in any way shape or form be said of the other countries you mention.  What, did you honestly believe that either Indonesia or China were about to let a US/NATO carrier group impose a ""no-fly"" zone over East Timor?  Are you drunk or just plain stupid?

As for Darfur, do you have a good plan for how NATO should somehow get in there and actually do any good?  What do think will work?  Which NATO country do you think will put up with the heavy casualties they'll inevitably take?  And for what?  Do you really think that any NATO member is enthusiastic about repeating the US ""Blackhawk Down"" experience in Mogadishu?        

And if you know anything at all about Rwanda, you know that Mogadishu is *exactly* why Clinton was politically paralyzed, and that if any NATO member was going to do anything about it, it had to be France or Belgium which, after all, were the colonial powers largely responsible for creating the situation in the first place.  

Long story short, while I don't think that CNN ought to have deleted your comment, neither does it really hurt my feelings that they did since you are quite manifestly a rank amateur with a schoolboy's understanding of international events.

Music journalism has always been about the major labels, who in turn do well enough using the press as their own personal PR campaign flooding them with releases. It's a cartel.
Today major labels represent only a small portion of the industry as a whole, but they're ""old money"" and with their control over inter/national press and distribution channels they're free to represent themselves as they see fit. This is also happened with the ""war on piracy"". The flagrant abuse of customers by only four labels masquerading as representatives of not just their music, but all music.

&gt;the industry equates it to lost sales and lobbyed the lawmakers

My point in that piracy is illegal because it is copyright infringement, under laws that have existed for hundreds of years. The law was *strengthened* by lobbyists, true, in the late 1990s, which resulted in the **god-awful DMCA** which many corporations and lawyers [mistakenly believe applies to every country](http://thepiratebay.org/legal) and not just the US. (Though Europe has [passed its own version](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Directive).)

Most forms of piracy already illegal before the DMCA was passed. For example, it was already illegal to download video game or music without legal authorization. The DMCA strengthened penalties, and **added penalties for circumventing DRM**. To create harsher penalties and to scare people more. But even without this added regulation, the *end result* of removing DRM is *generally* piracy, which was already illegal. (An exception would be if you ripped a DVD you owned so you could watch it on another device; which this was often considered illegal, it wasn't *expressly* illegal before DMCA, but it definitely was after DMCA.)

I took a long journey to explain all of this however:

*Piracy* is illegal because it is copyright infringement. 

*Copyright infringement* is illegal because [back in the early 1700s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Anne), the government felt that it was important to protect an author's ability to have the exclusive (but transferable) right to copy, distribute and adapt his creation. (The government also wanted to control dissemination of dissent, as Mokky has pointed out, but modern copyright laws do not do this, they do not require the government licensing of tools of media production; anyone can buy a camcorder and shoot a movie and put it online, for example.)

Without this protection (back then) a big publisher could take someone else's book, publish it themselves, and make money off it. Today, the same is true, but there are more applications. For example, huge corporations could come in, gobble up new work, and sell it themselves. ***Without this type of protection, EA could decide to take Minecraft and sell it themselves. Activision could decide to make their own Half-Life game. Michael Bay could decide to make his own sequel to District 9.*** These things are a different form of piracy than downloading a game off a torrent, yes, but they are still piracy and are still forbidden under the same statutes that forbid piracy. 

The *legal* philosophy here is that people who create something should be protected from any unauthorized use, whether that use is big or small, whether that use is by one person or a corporation. Unless the creator of something wants to make it free, wants to make it open, but even then there are restrictions.

(That said, copyright laws are flawed in many ways and in desperate need of revision.)

Edit: Bad reviews can never be illegal where there is any sort of freedom of speech or freedom of the press. Though if the industry were to try to attack reviews, they would probably start by suing in UK courts for libel against the author and publisher, since UK libel laws are so [ridiculous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_defamation_law).

Don’t blame luck when your models misfire

By John Kay
Published: March 1 2011 22:31 | Last updated: March 1 2011 22:31


When the financial crisis broke in August 2007, David Viniar, chief financial officer of Goldman Sachs, famously commented that 25-standard deviation events had occurred on several successive days. If you marked your position to market every day for a million years, there would still be a less than one in a million chance of experiencing a 25-standard deviation event. None had occurred. What had happened was that the models Goldman used to manage risk failed to describe the world in which it operated.

If the water in your glass turns to wine, you should consider more prosaic explanations before announcing a miracle. If your coin comes up heads 10 times in a row – a one in a thousand probability – it may be your lucky day. But the more likely reason is that the coin is biased, or the person who flips the penny or reports the result is cheating. The source of most extreme outcomes is not the fulfilment of possible but improbable predictions within models, but events that are outside the scope of these models.


Sixty years ago, a French economist described the Allais paradox, based on the discovery that most people treat very high probabilities quite differently from certainties. Not only do normal people think this way, but they are right to do so. There are no 99 per cent probabilities in the real world. Very high and very low probabilities are artifices of models, and the probability that any model perfectly describes the world is much less than one. Once you compound the probabilities delivered by the model with the unknown but large probability of model failure, the reassurance you crave disappears.

Techniques such as value at risk modelling – the principal methodology used by banks and pressed on them by their regulators – may be of help in monitoring the day-to-day volatility of returns. But they are useless for understanding extreme events, which is, unfortunately, the main purpose for which they are employed. This is what Mr Viniar and others learnt, or should have learnt, in 2007.

Yet the use of risk models of this type is one of many areas of finance in which nothing much has changed. The European Union is ploughing ahead with its Solvency II directive for insurers, which – incredibly – is explicitly modelled on the failed Basel II agreements for monitoring bank solvency. Solvency II requires that businesses develop models that show the probability of imminent collapse is below 0.5 per cent.

Insurance companies do fail, but not for the reasons described in such models. They fail because of events that were unanticipated or ignored, such as the long-hidden danger from asbestos exposure, or the House of Lords judgment on Equitable Life. They fail because underwriters misunderstood the risk characteristics of their policies, as at AIG, or because of fraud, as at Equity Fundings.

Multiple sigma outcomes do not happen in real life. When all the Merchant of Venice’s ships are lost at sea during the interval, we know that we are watching a play, not an account of history. Shakespeare, no fool, knew that too. In Act V Antonio was able to write back his loss provisions in full even if it was too late to fulfil his banking covenant to Shylock.

But today the modellers are in charge, not the poets. Like practitioners of alchemy and quack medicine, these modellers thrive on our desire to believe impossible things. But the search for objective means of controlling risks that can reliably be monitored externally is as fruitless as the quest to turn base metal into gold. Like the alchemists and the quacks, the risk modellers have created an industry whose intense technical debates with each other lead gullible outsiders to believe that this is a profession with genuine expertise.

We will succeed in managing financial risk better only when we come to recognise the limitations of formal modelling. Control of risk is almost entirely a matter of management competence, well-crafted incentives, robust structures and systems, and simplicity and transparency of design.

&gt;Among the many wonders to be expected from an Obama administration, if Nicholas D. Kristof of the New York Times is to be believed, is ending “the anti-intellectualism that has long been a strain in American life.”

&gt;He cited Adlai Stevenson, the suave and debonair governor of Illinois, who twice ran for president against Eisenhower in the 1950s, as an example of an intellectual in politics.

&gt;Intellectuals, according to Mr. Kristof, are people who are “interested in ideas and comfortable with complexity,” people who “read the classics.”

&gt;It is hard to know whether to laugh or cry.

&gt;Adlai Stevenson was certainly regarded as an intellectual by intellectuals in the 1950s. But, half a century later, facts paint a very different picture.

&gt;Historian Michael Beschloss, among others, has noted that Stevenson “could go quite happily for months or years without picking up a book.” But Stevenson had the airs of an intellectual — the form, rather than the substance.

&gt;What is more telling, form was enough to impress the intellectuals, not only then but even now, years after the facts have been revealed, though apparently not to Mr. Kristof.

&gt;That is one of many reasons why intellectuals are not taken as seriously by others as they take themselves.

&gt;As for reading the classics, President Harry Truman, whom no one thought of as an intellectual, was a voracious reader of heavyweight stuff like Thucydides and read Cicero in the original Latin. When Chief Justice Carl Vinson quoted in Latin, Truman was able to correct him.

&gt;Yet intellectuals tended to think of the unpretentious and plain-spoken Truman as little more than a country bumpkin.

&gt;Similarly, no one ever thought of President Calvin Coolidge as an intellectual. Yet Coolidge also read the classics in the White House. He read both Latin and Greek, and read Dante in the original Italian, since he spoke several languages. It was said that the taciturn Coolidge could be silent in five different languages.

&gt;The intellectual levels of politicians are just one of the many things that intellectuals have grossly misjudged for years on end.

&gt;During the 1930s, some of the leading intellectuals in America condemned our economic system and pointed to the centrally planned Soviet economy as a model — all this at a time when literally millions of people were starving to death in the Soviet Union, from a famine in a country with some of the richest farmland in Europe and historically a large exporter of food.

&gt;**New York Times Moscow correspondent Walter Duranty won a Pulitzer Prize for telling the intelligentsia what they wanted to hear — that claims of starvation in the Ukraine were false.**

&gt;**After British journalist Malcolm Muggeridge reported from the Ukraine on the massive deaths from starvation there, he was ostracized after returning to England and unable to find a job.**

&gt;More than half a century later, when the archives of the Soviet Union were finally opened up under Mikhail Gorbachev, it turned out that about six million people had died in that famine — about the same number as the people killed in Hitler’s Holocaust.

&gt;In the 1930s, it was the intellectuals who pooh-poohed the dangers from the rise of Hitler and urged Western disarmament.

&gt;It would be no feat to fill a big book with all the things on which intellectuals were grossly mistaken, just in the 20th century — far more so than ordinary people.

&gt;**History fully vindicates the late William F. Buckley’s view that he would rather be ruled by people represented by the first 100 names in the Boston phone book than by the faculty of Harvard.**

&gt;How have intellectuals managed to be so wrong, so often? By thinking that because they are knowledgeable — or even expert — within some narrow band out of the vast spectrum of human concerns, that makes them wise guides to the masses and to the rulers of the nation.

&gt;But the ignorance of Ph.D.s is still ignorance and high-IQ groupthink is still groupthink, which is the antithesis of real thinking.

IMPORTANT: Do this dry!  Water washes off a lot of the flavor and also makes later steps harder.  It's very difficult to get mushrooms dry, which is required if they are going to brown properly. In the US, AFAIK, the manure is pasturized, so you can't really get sick from it (unlike in the EU where mushrooms will destroy you the first time you eat them), so don't sweat it if you aren't 100% perfect in this step.

Slice them about 5-7mm thick and set aside.

Pound chicken breasts THIN, make sure you cover it with seran wrap or salmonella will go EVERYWHERE! Hit with an egg wash and dredge in a flour/salt/pepper/oregano mixture.

Heat up olive oil in a sautee pan.  Once it's hot, add a tiny bit of butter and swirl it around until the foam dies down.  Now add the lightly breaded chicken breasts and brown on one side (4-6 minutes?).  Flip the chicken over and add all the mushrooms.

In the mean time, make a small roux, oil or butter will work fine, with some flour, into a thick paste.

  Once the chicken is browned on the other side, pull it and set aside on a warm plate to rest.  Deglaze the pan with marsala, add the roux, and cover.  Cook the mushrooms until they look and smell amazing, a few minutes maybe?  Give it a quick flip partway through to make sure you are hitting all the mushrooms and coating evenly.

Serve the chicken and mushrooms over whatever sides work in your diet: tons of egg noodles for carb backfill, by itself in large quantities for protein+veggies, sautee onions on the side, etc, whatever you want.

3)""In his speech Wednesday, Gadhafi lashed out at international moves against his regime, including the freezing of his and other Libyan assets abroad — an act he called 'piracy' — and efforts by Europe to send aid to opposition-held Benghazi. He said any Libyan who accepts international aid was guilty of ""high treason"" because it ""opens Libya to colonialism.'

In a pointed message to Europe, he warned, 'There will be no stability in the Mediterranean if there is no stability in Libya.'

'Africans will march to Europe without anyone to stop them. The Mediterranean will become a center for piracy like Somalia,' he said. Gadhafi's regime has worked closely with Italy and other European countries to stop African migrants who use Libya as a launching point to slip into Europe.

He also threatened to bring in Chinese and Indian companies to replace Western companies in Libya's oil sector if the West keeps up its pressure on him. European firms are heavily involved in Libya's oil production.""[source](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110302/ap_on_re_af/af_libya)

The US needs an enemy, and creating the Islamic terrorist enemy didn't work out as the military-industrial complex and gov't wanted.

NATO is indeed an effective offensive military alliance, but the Europeans increasingly are not on board with US imperialism, preferring to take a softer approach, and are somewhat skeptical about the US backing of Israel.

BRIC as some sort of counter alliance it NATO is truly laughable. Common interests are shallow, and military integration and agreement are basically non-existent.

The US is going to have to provoke someone into a war to create an enemy that the American public can rally 'round the flag and believe in, but even then, it'll have to be an enemy that the Chinese are willing to fund the US to fight.

Look at Hondas, ever since the 80's the US has always gotten ""de-tuned"" versions of the same cars that were released in Japan and Europe. US models in the 80's had EGR and were loaded with emissions controls while many foreign cars had much simpler EFI and carbureted systems. 

When tuning an engine, you can generally tune for 2 out of 3 basic things. You have power, emissions, and mileage. If you tune for power and mileage, you usually are throwing emissions out the window. If you tune for emissions and mileage, there goes your power. 

California tends to have the highest emissions standards out of any state. So when companies bring cars in from overseas, they tune them for California, and then the rest of the country gets those same cars. 

This is why Europe gets so many diesels and we don't. California is super strict on diesel emissions, and the rest of the country gets fucked because of it. Can you really blame them though? That's the smoggiest fucking place on earth.

It's probably why we'll never see the Ford Focus RS 500 here. It's an amazing, powerful car. But we'd probably have to de-tune it to meet emissions.

War is not a good thing and war will never be a good thing. War to end Hitler's reign was not a good thing, but nobody could thing of another alternative. The Civil War was not a good thing. Vietnam was horrible. You could argue that good things came of these wars. For example, nuclear power, a strong U.S. central government, or... well I'm not sure anything good really came of Vietnam. Velcro? Anyway, on the other hand, some claim nuclear power is bad (derp, it's awesome), and it's true, we have the power to end the human race now. That's bad. How good is a strong U.S. central government when it finally becomes so powerful that the people have no way to overthrow it (too late?). Maybe the Confederates were right. Maybe Germany would have overthrown Hitler and ended the holocaust, and all of Europe would be united under the remarkably powerful, rich, and industrious German nation (see: present.

Tell you what: why don't you quickly specify and calibrate a market risk charge solvency capital model that incorporates equity, fixed-interest and property markets with an explicit risk aggregation component? You can use whatever approach you prefer (correlation matrices, copulas etc) but I would like you to empirically confirm (i.e. using price history data) that your calibration is consistent with a 99.5% VaR shock? I eagerly await your results.

&gt;It seems pretty trivial to me.

No offence but this can only arise from ignorance on this topic on your behalf. Calibration of risk aggregation structures is one of the biggest outstanding problems in the Solvency II QIS 5 technical specifications. If all the collected actuarial resources of the EU insurance and reinsurance market cannot solve this problem in a robust way, then I will be very impressed indeed if you manage to do it.

&gt;The reasons noone has done it is because it would increase capital requirements and reduce profitability.

Let us use an example from the world of insurance. The Solvency II QIS 5 model errs on the side of being _too_ prudent in its estimation of solvency capital requirements. Because of the difficulty of calibrating the correlation matrices between risk sub-module components and in some cases between the sub-modules themselves, QIS 5 assigned either low (0.25) medium (0.5) or high (0.75) correlations based on expert judgment. You are most welcome to read about how European industry responded to the SCR calculated under this approach. Look for the correlations consultation paper on the EIOPA website, then look for its corresponding feedback. I think its consultation paper 74.

&gt;This means there is no money in it for greed banks or consultants.

Ah, here we go! This is an emotional issue for you, not simply an academic one. How can you expect people to take you seriously if your complaint is not based on facts but rather on your perception of how 'greedy' banks and consultants are?

&gt;They will chose a model with lower capital requirements

Actually there is a standard model. In order for internal models to qualify they need to pass the 'use test' whereby they are incorporated into every facet of the business from rating onwards, not just at the reserving and solvency requirements stage.

A small group of mostly male people controlled society through most of history… but there were plenty of women in that group. The patriarchy theory seriously suggests that during the Victorian era a small boy working in a coal mine is part of the oppressive group and Queen Victoria was part of the oppressed group.

Patriarchy refers to a general trend, it does not apply to every single situation. To suggest that is, as you say, ridiculous. But just because it does not apply in all cases does not make any less true. 

&gt;Here is a short list of the ways feminist law makers harm men.

Some of those are bullshit. The ERA that was referenced was opposed by Phyllis Schlafly, a conservative who strongly opposes feminism. Additionally, the verdicts of the numerous court cases weren't the fault of feminists -- they were ruled on by judges. I would posit that many of the ""feminist"" laws were put on the books by conservatives who believe that women ""can't rape"" or ""commit domestic violence"" -- which is a symptom of the patriarchy which you dismiss. The patriarchy harms both men and women. 

&gt;This is pretty irrelevant frankly. First it only applies to America (I grew up with Magaret Thatcher as Prime Minister) and Angela Merkel is the most powerful governmental person in the EU today. 2nd it ignores the fact that the majority of voters are women.

I disagree. America is the strongest nation currently -- its leaders are relevant to everyone. Even though you named a few powerful female leaders, that doesn't change the fact that there's still a strong majority of men in political office. 

&gt;The wage gap has consistently been shown to be a feminist myth. It’s a lie.

That's one link to a study that explicitly says more research is needed. I could find tens of links that say the wage gap is legitimate true. 

&gt;How about the even more common custom of women receiving custody of children during a divorce?

Again, this is also caused by patriarchy. Patriarchy causes men to be seen as strong, workers, etc. while women are seen as nurturers. Feminists want this to end too. 

I think you're hitting r/mensrights a bit too hard. I would posit that many feminists agree that all of the issues you linked to are issues, and should be corrected.

Just like the Christian people sustain the Vatican and the Islamic people sustain Saudi Arabia. I see you point.

My point is that support for Israel is running out. US is in the process of self destructing, I doubt they'll continue to see the value in supporting Israel beyond morally. In Europe the last people who remember the Nazis are all but gone. And in Arabian nations the people will gain a voice. *Jewish* (i.e. apartheid) Israel will become pretty isolated and it will be reflected in the economy. Don't fool yourself, those who can *will* leave for somewhere better. It's already happening now - and so many Israelis getting dual citizenship, I wonder why?

It all comes down to a rather simple principle: water runs down following the route of least resistance. Palestinians have nowhere to go, lots of Israelis have (lots of Israelis don't too that's right but the Israeli elite does and will). So you get a *Jewish* Israel that will become increasingly fundamentalist and racist (it already is with prohibiting cross-religious marriages in fear of Jewishness being overtaken by other ethnic/religious groups). I don't see how Israel will be able to survive as a *Jewish* state more than at the most two generations.

EDIT: I would like to add something. 

Those processes usually follow a common pattern: very few leave in the beginning then it slowly accelerates and suddenly everybody wants to leave. Those who leave early will find their new home countries open and welcoming, those who wait till the last minute risk not being allowed in. So late in the process there will be a rush to get out before it's too late.

&gt;Americans equaled or exceeded respondents from the other four nations in their ability to name their own head of state (99% for Americans, 99% for the French, 96% for the British, 95% for West Germans, and 89% for the Italians). Americans were about as likely as the others to know the prime minister of Japan, but were considerably less able to identify the heads of state of Western European nations. And the five-nation survey that formed the basis for Almond and Verba's The Civic Culture (1963) found a considerably higher percentage of Americans and Germans able to name four or more party leaders when compared with the English, Italians, or Mexicans. Americans were behind the Germans, but comparable to the British, in the ability to name four or more cabinet offices. Finally, a 1988 National Geographic survey asked representative samples of adult citizens from nine countries to locate 16 ""places"" on a map of the world (14 countries and two bodies of water). Overall, Americans correctly located an average of 8.6 places, putting them sixth out of the nine countries included in the survey. More specifically, Americans were above average in locating places relatively close to them (e.g., Canada, Mexico, Central America, the Pacific Ocean, and the United States itself), while they were below average in identifying areas that are geographically more distant. (Carpini 2005)

Certainly the US can do better -- especially on press freedom where it ought to be among the top 10 and in terms of educating its populace about the Eastern hemisphere where it is so involved -- but we're a fairly average nation in all of the items listed in the ""perfect"" recipe for fascism, so I'm maybe a little more worried about other nations who are decidedly below average (and have far more economic and social turmoil) going down that path than the US.

**Admittedly some studies, including the one cited, point to Americans' lack of knowledge about international (read: Euro-centric) current events as evidence that Americans are ""less informed"" about world events than Europeans. Likewise, in some survey results Europeans are applauded for testing better than Americans on European geography while American knowledge of the Western hemisphere is a dismissed afterthought. I think that's fairly stupid for what I hope are obvious reasons, but if you accept that as a basis for judgment then Americans are slightly below average for a developed nation in terms of ""world"" current events, though still within normal range.*",c1j31ti,True,t3_fw7eo,1299119799,t3_fw7eo,True,t5_2qh9a,,t1_c1j31ti,15,0

&gt;Sadly, political leaders do not always act in the long-term best interest of their nations' economies. For numerous examples, see..hell, just pick any Western democracy over the last generation or so. 
  
Yes, but those Western democracies have been picking on smaller nations and not ones likely to cause a grand scale type war.
  
&gt;Also look at Castro and Mao as examples of leaders who weren't afraid to wreck their nations' economies for the sake of ideological goals.
  
Sure they did, but they weren't picking fights with other countries that they had trade agreements with while doing it.  Big difference.
  
&gt;Before WWI, there were intellectuals writing that there would never be another big European war because of rapid communications and the growing economic interdependence of European countries.
  
I'm sure this is true, but the common sentiment at that time was the Europe was ""an armed camp"".  Essentially a powder keg of alliances just waiting for the right moment to drag everybody down into a quagmire.
  
I'm getting away here from my larger point, which is that if WW III didn't happen during the Cold War, despite a less globalized economy and all of the proxy wars going on between major powers, it's even less likely to happen now.
  
A lot of that had to do with MAD, of course.  Combine MAD with economies that are pretty much entirely dependent on each other, and we have the situation we're in.
  
When we're talking about a second American civil war, MAD really doesn't come into play.  
  
At least I don't think so.  I mean if say, for example, North Dakota decided to secede, would they threaten to use the nuclear arsenal there on DC if they don't get their way?  I doubt it, but it's an interesting what if scenario.

Remember that VAT is collected at all points along the supply chain, on each incremental amount of ""value"" added at that point - but recouped, so only the final consumer is paying the full amount of the tax.  It's the same as sales tax, except that a sales tax is _only_ collected at the last point of sale.  The only difference is that it makes it easier for governments to collect taxes - and, I suspect, as a result to raise taxes because they're harder to get around, but that's just me being a conspiracy nut.

When you import an item, the govt. has not had the chance to collect tax along the path of production, so they collect when you enter the country.  That is why tax-free reciprocity exists in some countries -- hypothetically you're always supposed to pay the VAT in the country you import something to, but if there's tax-free or tax-back shopping, you can claim the tax back (or part of it, minus ""fees"") from the country where you bought it - since you're not using it there.

It's not triple taxation, but double taxation, insofar as you're paying tax on your income, THEN paying tax again on consumption -- and a consumption tax is, as we all know, a regressive tax.

Ah, the ""I can't be racist because I have foreign blood"" argument. Almost as common as ""Some of my best friends are black"", and just as wrong. You would be hard pressed to find someone in the UK without foreign blood, as we are a nation of immigrants. Sadly, your genetic background has no bearing on whether you are racist - latently or otherwise. 

&gt; An odd apostrophe mistake is quite a different matter from bastardising a language.

You are hopelessly clueless about language. Every language, ever, since the dawn of time has been constantly 'bastardized'. Language evolves constantly. The English of today is entirely unrecognisable from the English of just a few hundred years ago. English itself is a 'bastardized' form of other European languages - the original language here would have been Celtic, so much more like Welsh or Gaelic than English. Every wave of immigrants since then has contributed their own words and meanings. Many of our words are Anglo-Saxon in origin - so they came from Denmark and that area. Half of our words are French in origin, from the Norman conquest. 

One of the reasons English can be confusing for foreign language speakers is that it makes little logical sense - the grammar is not consistent, because English is made up of about 10 other languages.
There is not one 'correct' form that remains the same. 

I doubt there are any black people born in the UK in the last 50 years who are not capable of speaking English as used at school, offices etc. Some use Ebonics among themselves, which contributes to a community identity. It is in no way lazy or stupid, and saying so is offensive and ignorant. As for those not born here, well, if you want to complain about foreigners having foreign accents, you may as well join the BNP now. 

The Polish community in my area is English-speaking, but they tend to teach Polish to their children, and they often speak Polish at home and socially. Is that lazy and ignorant?

Defense and infrastructure are functions of a small government. Education is a function of a big government but a government can still stay small if that's the only non-core function it provides.

You can't have government being the pay-master for a trillion $ sector of the economy and expect government to stay small.

Social democracy is a failed type of economic organization. Before you cite me Norway or Sweden (and ignore Spain and Greece), I'll point out that any where it's been tried, INCLUDING the Scandinavian countries, it's led to slow economic growth.

So, yeah, someone could sprint around in full armor (which is comparable to a modern soldier's full kit, I just read, something like 40 lbs.), swinging a five foot long, six lb. sword with arrow shafts sticking out of his back and a dagger hanging out of his liver and I'd be fine with that.

Some people *like* TouchWiz and hate Sense, or they like Sense but hate stock Android. There's so much hardware out right now, I really think there's one device for everyone.

I have been using a Hero with (an old version of) HTC Sense, and I switched to the Nexus One a while ago. I really like it, but I have to say, I miss some features of Sense (and that's only the old Sense version... I've seen some additional pretty nice stuff on newer HTC devices).

Granted, *now* I prefer stock Android with Gingerbread. But back in the days when manufacturers started with the modifications stock Android was a lot uglier.

You/We can hate the modifications/skins as much as we want, they *do* actually add additional functionality. And Google has already incorporated a few ideas from those modifications.

Android never would have gotten so far if Google had imposed strong restrictions on how OEMs may modify the OS. As long as a specific set of features is compatible Google approves. Other things don't seem to matter, for example crippling Bluetooth support, or UI changes.

So, in other words: dad started a fight he couldn't finish, kid gets a do-over? Does it work like that in any world you're familiar with ?

&gt; But didn't the UN kind of already outline a Palestinian state?

Yes, it did. Quite clearly. That division wasn't accepted by Arabs in the region and combat was initiated. You don't get a do-over just because you lost a war you started.

&gt; Isn't Israel building, without regard for these borders, in these areas.

Since borders were never demarcated, that would be an inexact proposition.

&gt; Doesn't the word 'occupied' indicate that they aren't a part of Israel?

And by not annexating them Israel has made clear that they are not part of Israel proper, thus open to negotiation. But it would be wrong to believe they are part of some Palestinian entity, because there was never one. Jordan, the rightful owner of those lands, relinquished their claim to them, but did not negotiate who has that claim now. 

&gt; You said leave them with nothing.

Re-read my words. I said their negotiation position is leaving them with nothing.

&gt; Right now they have something, thus you implied that Israel should take all the land and displace the Palestinians.

You know what they say about assuming, right? I didn't say anything of the sort.

&gt; If that's not what you meant you should refrain from broad ranging vitriol as it serves no purpose in an intelligent discussion.

See? Now you're presenting *actual* evidence. Now we can start discussing. On to read what the PDF actually says. The link on the website is broken so I went to NatCen website and fetched the actual one [here](http://www.natcen.ac.uk/media/329307/bsa%2026th%20questionnaire.pdf). The questions are available together with the % of people who answered each possibility. You're free to peruse all questions that you deem pertinent and make up your mind. Below I excerpt those that I find relevant.

The question 714 onward (search Q714) deal with spirituality and religion. 40.4% answered that they possess no spirituality. 59% answered to possess a degree of spirituality. So the majority does.

Q717 and Q718 deal with belief in afterlife and belief in God. Very few people belief in afterlife, which is understandable. Many religions do not possess an afterlife, even some Christian ones. Belief in God, however... we have 48.8% of people that are at least somewhat sure that God exists. It is not an absolute majority, but if you ignore those that refused to answer, didn't have an opinion, or are unsure, you're hardly able to attain a majority of atheist opinion.

Questions 756, 757 and 758 deal with believe in Bible. We have 52.9%, 56.4%, and 54.6% of people that believe in the Bible being inspired by God, respectively. The majority does.

So, I think the majority is still religious, sorry. As the website you linked said itself, 51% do not possess *a religion* but not possessing a religion hardly equates to being *an atheist*. You can be deist, theist or non-denominational, and you would not possess a religion and still not be an atheist. As I said in my first reply, the only way that atheists can claim a 'majority' is by conflating atheism with non-denominational and agnosticism. Had you said that there was a majority of 'non-religious' people, I'd have agreed with you, as I said it myself in the first reply. But a majority of *atheist* is deceiving atheist propaganda.

Interestingly enough, the questions 800 and 801 ask if people believe if religion is increasing or decreasing and if it is a good or bad thing. The majority believes that religion is decreasing, and the majority believes that *this is a bad thing*. Telling.

So there. Again, you're free to peruse the questionaire yourself and make up your own conclusions. As far as I could gather from it, it does not support your statement.

&gt; I wonder, though, why you try to keep those two separate.

Philosophy considers the distinction to be important. If you don't believe me, ask on /r/philosophy.

&gt; You can say all you want that humans have a predisposition towards explanations (and thus religion), but I take that a step further and say that humans have a predisposition towards true explanation (and thus science).

No, they don't. Selection Bias, Confirmation Bias and Cognitive Dissonance are important parts of how the human mind work, and they completely disregard truthness. The human mind selects for explanations that increase your survival fitness, not for true ones.

&gt; I would love to hear Dawkins give his ideas about the topic; if you can find the source where he states his agreement with you and gives a full argument for it, then I would be more than happy to read it.

[Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme#Religion). Read the linked topic on Evolutionary Psychology of Religion too.

&gt; His claim that ""Conduct, deprived of its religious supports, deteriorates into epicurean chaos"" is completely unsupported.

Durant wrote 11 books dealing with the whole history known of mankind when he was alive. To call his conclusion ""completely unsupported"" is blatantly ignorant and preposterous.

&gt; I would love to know of a single country that has fallen chiefly due to a lack of religion.

It is not a lack of religion but a weakening of religious values. I suggest googling ""Sir John Glubb"" ""The Fate of Empires"" for a short work on rise and fall of civilizations and some examples (short when compared to Durant or Toynbee works).

&gt; There is a massive amount of conflict between science and religion.

No, there isn't. The Catholic Church was the bastion of science until the middle 20th century. Not only the Church sponsored the scientific advances since the fall of Rome, but the Academia and Universities as well, and almost all notable scientists until 20th century were priests, the last notable mention being Mendell.

&gt; this part is true, but this part is a metaphor. At what point does that distinction end?

What does it has to do with the topic at hand, that is, the conflict between science and religion? I am sorry, but your red herring will go ignored.

&gt; Science has proven almost everything said within all three Abrahamic religions to be wrong,

Really? Make a list. Get everything said withing all three (sic) Abrahamic religions in a list and compare with another list of things that science has proven wrong. Let's see if it lives true to the label of ""almost everything."" Or if it is just more unsupported atheist propaganda (hint:it is).

&gt; In most first-world nations it is. In nations that have the industrial and educational backgrounds needed to adequately teach and certify their youth, the amount of non-believers is growing while the amount of believers is diminishing. Just because the numbers are growing much slower in the United States doesn't mean it isn't happening here, too. You claim it isn't, but you have yet to supply any data for your assertion.

Quite the opposite. I remember clearly stating that secularism (not science, *secularism*) is increasing in both US and Europe, while religion is increasing everywhere else. Saying that science is increasing is stupid as science is a field of work, not an ideology. Science increases when more people become scientists, not when they abandon religion.

The idea of 'first world' nations is a biased one. It steems from the idea that democratic nations are inherently superior to other ones merely because they are democratic. Today the world is divided between developed nations, nations in the process of developing and non-developed nations. Your claim is not supported by evidence. Not only the USA education system is *laughable* but also mere availability of information means nothing. One still has to learn it. China and India are scientific powerhouses and religion is increasing there.

&gt; I'm not entirely sure what you mean by this; could you elaborate?

&gt;The methanol produced by the metabolism of aspartame is absorbed and quickly converted into formaldehyde and then completely converted to formic acid.[53] The methanol from aspartame is unlikely to be a safety concern for several reasons. The amount of methanol in aspartame is less than that found in fruit juices and citrus fruits, and there are other dietary sources for methanol such as fermented beverages. Therefore, the amount of methanol produced from aspartame is likely to be less than that from natural sources. With regards to formaldehyde, it is rapidly converted in the body, and the amounts of formaldehyde from the metabolism of aspartame is trivial when compared to the amounts produced routinely by the human body and from other foods and drugs.[7] Ingesting aspartame at the 90th percentile of intake would produce 25 times less methanol than would be considered toxic.[53]

1. Libya's proven oil reserves are the largest in Africa - making it a prime target for a false flag event as described in my hypothesis.

2. Libyan's quality of life is among the highest in Africa (free healthcare, access to clean water, age expectancy of over 70, poverty rate of under 8%) - which would indicate that riots are not particularly as likely as Egypt, where there is genuine poverty.

3. [There are first hand reports from Libya and Bahrain](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/ft9vv/this_is_going_to_sound_insane_but_i_think_america/) that our media is not telling us the truth about the protests (scroll down a little to see the one from Bahrain). Also it seems that the media may have been [caught in a lie about the air strikes](http://rt.com/news/airstrikes-libya-russian-military/).

4. The UN Security Council [""granted broad immunity from war crimes prosecution for the mercenaries responsible for many of the bloodiest massacres against the pro-democracy protesters""](http://news.antiwar.com/2011/02/27/us-measure-ensures-gadhafi-mercs-immune-from-war-crimes-prosecution/) - which was at the US' request. This could indicate that the US is planning to send, or has already sent, mercenaries to Libya.

5. Gaddafi has support in Libya from many Libyans; something the media barely, and grudgingly report. See [here](http://www.reuters.com/news/video?videoId=190592397&amp;feedType=VideoRSS&amp;feedName=TopNews&amp;videoChannel=1&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:+reuters/USVideoTopNews+) and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebA6qUoH2h4).

6. [The US and EU are planning](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-27/qaddafi-asset-freeze-approved-by-un-as-rebels-declare-provisional-regime.html) sanctions against Libya and the freezing of Gaddafi's assets. [There is even a report that the US already has troops in Libya](http://www.prisonplanet.com/report-us-special-forces-arrive-in-libya.html). An invasion by the US (and allies) is looking likely.

7. I'm not the only one who is suspicious. Two world leaders are speaking out - see [here](http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/03/01/libya.venezuela.chavez/index.html?hpt=T2) and [here](http://www.rferl.org/content/article/2324460.html)...

The US does not keep electronic records, which adds to the costs.

Then there is the fact that individuals cannot have their own private health insurance accounts.  They have to go through their employer, who is compelled to buy insurance from a government pre-approved list of insurers.  That increases the costs.

This sort of class barrier is exactly what public education is designed to minimize.

&gt;**One study has shown vegans to have higher bone fracture rates.** Luckily, the vegans in the study getting more than 525 mg of calcium had the same rates as those in the other diet groups indicating that if vegans get more calcium, they should be no worse off. Some vegans dismissed these results, but I responded by telling vegans to get more calcium.

The studies he references are the Oxford component of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC-Oxford). The American Dietitian Association’s 2009 position paper on vegetarian and vegan diets agrees with this assessment. Here it is on page 1269:

&gt;Calcium intakes of lacto-ovo-vegetarians are similar to, or higher than, those of nonvegetarians, whereas intakes of vegans tend to be lower than both groups and may fall below recommended intakes. In the Oxford component of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC-Oxford) study, the risk of bone fracture was similar for lacto-ovo-vegetarians and meat eaters, whereas **vegans had a 30% higher risk of fracture** possibly due to their considerably lower mean calcium intake. 

…

&gt;In addition, some studies show that the ratio of dietary calcium to protein is a better predictor of bone health than calcium intake alone. Typically, this ratio is high in lacto ovo-vegetarian diets and favors bone health, whereas vegans have a ratio of calcium to protein that is similar to or lower than that of nonvegetarians.

America is a big place full of religions are jockeying for power in a sort of religious Free Market. Religion prospers because of it. It prospers even more because the government is supposed to keep its hands off.

JUST like in Europe, we have big cities and little farming towns. And JUST like in Europe, even in the south, the big cities tend to be havens for queers and Atheists, and the small towns are the ones where everyone is scared that the big cities are going to eat them alive and the Monster in the Sky must be appeased. It's really a culture war going on here. The politicians pretend they are from small towns and from the country, and they lie and say that the country is the ""real"" America, but what they like to imply, and what many of us infer, is that Big Cities equals Queers, Jews, and Atheists. (For many of us, it's a big three-in-one! L'Chaim!)

That's right, they come right out and say that the Big Satanic Three equals ""not a real American."" They may believe it or not, but that's what they say, because that's what they believe ""Americans"" believe. And many Americans believe that that's what most Americans believe, even though they themselves are ambivalent. Americans: we like to be liked, we like to be popular, we like to be winners. So we go with what we think others will approve of us for.

Not fully, but I see your point.  But I also think you just included smoking in order to ""erase"" the obesity costs.  I could just include something else that un-erases smoking, but that won't get us anywhere, because then we'll just keep going back and forth.

&gt;Yes, some estimates say that. Other estimates say that we spent as little as 0.5% of our health care costs on malpractice costs. 

Those are defensive insurance cost estimates for 2001.  

Defensive medicine could contribute more to health spending than malpractice payments do, but it is difficult to measure and estimates vary widely.  The upper estimate referred to in that article is 9 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  But yes, we agree already that it is only part of the difference.

&gt;Even allowing for ""defensive medicine"", that explains a small part of the difference.

Well, the problems in the US are so numerous, that all the small differences add up together to make a large difference.  That's the gist of my last post.  There is no single thing that explains most of the difference.  It's a hundred small things.  

&gt;Yes, and a big reason for this is the fact that there are significant start-up costs associated with implementing and synchronizing electronic records that no single private provider wants to undertake. Still, I'll grant you that this could be done without nationalizing the system.

Actually, the reason why electronic records are so prevalent is not because of start up costs, but because Americans are so worried about changing premiums and other easily changeable information that they want paper copies so that they have something to use in case legal cases arise.  The large start up costs for electronic records won't stop investments in them, if the yearly savings outweigh the paper costs, which is most certainly the case.  Investors chase profits, they don't avoid large start up costs just because they are large.  But that logic, no oil rig would ever get built.

&gt;Source? 

Well, I inferred that anecdotally from the stylized fact that so many people are so quick to go to the emergency room for the most insignificant reasons.  Have you been to the US?

&gt;I think a big reason we see more emergency room costs than Europe is because we don't leave people with no insurance or money any other option. 

That is true, but that cannot explain why the costs are high to begin with.  It would be circular logic, because you are saying the costs are high because so many people use the emergency room, but then so many people use the emergency room because the costs are so high for health coverage.

&gt;When Reagan told hospitals that they had to treat people regardless of ability to pay, he effectively socialized our entire health care system in the least-efficient way possible.

Pretty much.  That is the way our government does things.  There is a two pronged split personality disorder philosophy underlying all politics.  Don't go full free market, but don't go full communist.  Do a really inefficient middle of the road package instead.  See our banking reform, education reform, etc, if you doubt this.

&gt;This isn't true. About 60% of the population gets insurance through employers, but about 9% buy their own private health insurance. I agree though, that the current employer-provided system is a mess, and we should eliminate the deduction.

Yeah, I see how the way I said that it is wrong.  What I meant was that in many cases, insurance companies do not offer private insurance, but only through companies.  That means that for many people, they simply cannot get health insurance except through an employer.

This health insurance through employers was due to government intervention dating back to world war 2, where government imposed price and wage controls not only gave incentives to employers to offer healthcare as a form of wage because healthcare was not subjected to controls, which led to the rise in employer insurance plans, but also imposed unsound private medical insurance practices.  These unsound practices were brought into being by the government as a means to forestall socialized medicine, and then, subsequent to ww2, coercive unions demanded healthcare from their employers as well, which most non-unionized businesses felt obliged to match, in order to avoid unionization at their businesses.  Add to this the fact that employer contributions to insurance were tax exempt, whereas the same contributions in the form of wages was fully taxable.  This made health insurance a virtual employer oligopoly.

&gt;Again, their health care systems play a major role in this by providing better incentives to patients and doctors.

Partly, maybe, because people still have to choose to buy the pills.  I know that doctors have told me to buy pills for my post minor-surgery pain, but I refused because there was no need to spend $50 a bottle for taking away some minor discomfort.  My cousin was told to buy anxiety pills, she refused, turns out it was because she had an ulcer.

&gt;This doesn't reduce competition. It simply allows states to pass their own insurance regulations, which is prudent until we improve our national insurance regulations.

Uh, no.  By preventing competition state to state, what you call ""prudent"", is actually a reduction in the number of insurance companies that can compete for a given individual customer's money.  By reducing the number of competing insurance companies, that raises the price of insurance.

It's interesting how you claim to be wanting to lower costs, but then defend something that acts to raise it, for the sole reason that it is the government is causing it to rise.  That isn't very prudent.

&gt;The same major insurance companies operate in several states, just with different subsidiary companies that operate under different state laws.

You are ignoring the fact that even if states allow SOME competition, they do restrict it, and THAT is what raises costs.  I am only trying to understand why costs are higher.  It makes no sense to ignore a particular reason simply because government is the cause.

&gt;I see a lot of arguments for the viability of alternatives to the nationalized universal health care model, but I have yet to see your argument for that model's drawbacks. 

Which model?  The current one?  Terrible.  The one I think is best?  No drawbacks at all, because my ideal system is one that gives individuals (healthcare providers and insurers, as well as customers) the most freedom to come to their own agreements, without violence being used to coerce them one way or the other ""for their own good"".

I am against narrow minded ""universal healthcare"", not only because our government is utterly evil and cannot do what other governments can do, but also because I want individuals to be free to decide what is best for themselves, and using violence to coerce them into the same system is not my idea of a moral and cost-effective system. 

Like you I want alternatives, and that system of alternatives can be viewed as a single alternative, namely, allowing individuals to come to their own agreements and their own alternatives.  If individuals want to form a single payer system, then I say good luck, have at it, just don't force anyone else into it if they don't want to take part and are willing to face the consequences.

&gt;What is it about better health care outcomes, lower costs, lower burdens on employers, and better patient satisfaction that you have reservations about?

What does this mean? Obviously there's a huge DEMAND for war shooting games otherwise these companies wouldn't exist. I'm not sure what this means exactly. The only way capitalism can squelch innovation is in the case of a monopoly which I acquiesce as the major problem with capitalism.

I'll also agree that socialism is not the strictly the antithesis of capitalism, but communism definitely encompasses socialism and we can all see where that ends up.

While my statements may be mischaracterized as ""talking points"", they are not a ridiculous argument, it's the bona fide outcome of socialistic policies. 

You want examples? Look at the housing projects in the United States - while I'm sure there's some hardworking ppl in that community, in *general*, here's a class of people created by the government, completely dependent upon the government, and since these policies were established in the 60's have created a **multi-generational** set of people who know no other way of life than to depend upon the government for:

 a) housing
 b) food
 c) electricity 

This is reality here in the U.S. If you lived here you could surely see this to be true. 

45 years ago the US created government programs designed to ""help"" income-challenged people. These programs DID NOT EXIST BEFORE but now has created a class of people dependent upon my tax money to just to survive.



Socialism is combined with capitalism in Europe primarily and it's become a negative trend in the United States as well. Alex de Tocqueville said *""A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largess from the public treasury""*. Guess what? We're there. The only thing left is to tax ourselves out of existence, or maybe just to the point of complete apathy.

Here's current examples of ""voting themselves largess from the public treasury in the United States:

a) City of Bell, California scandal
b) California's pension problems
c) Wisconsin's budget impasse where union workers are trying to get the government to pay for THEIR health care costs

Socialism amounts to the redistribution of wealth and has negative consequences for innovation, business, government and you the individual.

I warned you about mistranslation and spin, and you still stepped right into it.

Here's his statement in some context:

&gt;Well, then we have stirred up a very concrete discussion. We are posing two very clear questions. The first is: Did the Holocaust actually take place? You answer this question in the affirmative. So, the second question is: Whose fault was it? The answer to that has to be found in Europe and not in Palestine. It is perfectly clear: If the Holocaust took place in Europe, one also has to find the answer to it in Europe. […]

&gt; We don't want to confirm or deny the Holocaust. We oppose every type of crime against any people. But we want to know whether this crime actually took place or not. If it did, then those who bear the responsibility for it have to be punished, and not the Palestinians. 

Indeed, whenever Ahmadinejad bitches about the holocaust, it's in one of two contexts. Why is the holocaust often used as an excuse when someone brings up the Palestinian question, as if they had anything to do with it? And secondly, why are the Jews allowed to use their collective tragedy as an excuse for anything today? Far more Russians than Jews died at the hands of the Nazis, and I don't see them using WW2 as a pretext for fucking up other nations.

Secondly if you read your own goddamn link on the ""Death to america"" reference, you'd see that his words were:

&gt; We will soon see a new Middle East materialising without America and the Zionist regime and there will be no room for world arrogance (the West) in it

It was the crowd that yelled death to America, as they have been doing ever since America took their democratic country, fucked it all up, and imposed a dictator. I'm not Iranian myself, but I can sort of see why they may dislike US foreign policy.

&gt;The first point Krugman was making was that if one looked at maps of the US and Europe, with the states/countries identified by unemployment rate, it would misleading to compare them and say there are large regions on both maps that are outperforming other large areas. 

The first point Krugman made was that it is an illusion to think that there are significant differences in unemployment across states.  He said it is ""illusion"" to think there is.  The unemployment differences are due to population size differences, and correcting for that, ""we're all sharing the pain"" equally.

&gt;His second point was for the most part unrelated to the first point, which is that higher per-capita stimulus spending resulted in better unemployment results at the state level.

His second point, two weeks later, was that now there are significant differences in unemployment between states, that population sizes are now not responsible, and that the significant differences in unemployment is due to Keynesian stimulus differences across states.

In other words, Krugman refused to accept that there were significant differences in unemployment across states until a Keynesian economics paper ""allowed"" him to admit it.

And to be honest, after the whole proletariat revolt, Marxist theory starts becoming pretty shoddy and extremely harder to logically support.

In my opinion in terms of our current situation, our society has too many factors that effectively ELIMINATE the development of class consciousness, such as:

a.) The Protestant Ethic (often cited as the #1 reason Communism didn't spread to Western Europe)

b.) Corporate control of media

c.) Effective use of the media in dividing the proletariat on several grounds:

dems vs. republicans, gays vs. straights, blacks vs. whites, christians vs. atheists, public workers vs. private workers... the list goes on

d.) Depiction of America as the ideal classless society firmly indoctrinated into our schools curricula (along with barely covering any labor issues in K-12 ed)

sat testing measures your ability to guess a

very well educated teacher.

ap exams... the current consesus from college and high school perspectives is that aps are too easy and let way too many unprepared kids into higher level classes. they are being reconsidered and they have less value now than  they did 15-20 yrs ago. I keep hearing that they may do away with the current ap program, or totally revamp it. 

now 1/3 of students take ap exams. the issue we are seeing with them is:

1. teachers do not teach thinking skills, they teach teat takig skills and teach the material that's going to be on the test.

2. too many kids take ap and it waters
down the class to where kids who are not truly above average are taking these classes.

3. bc of #1 above colleges are finding students are unprepared, unable to think critically, unable to
master information in varying formats (abstract thinking skills), and way too many freshmen in classes they just aren't prepared for.

MC: such an amazing player, he's one of the most confident Protoss players I've ever seen. He is a god at every aspect of the game, and I have never failed to be entertained when he plays.

IdrA: Say what you want about his bm and various rage moments, but his gameplay can be awe-inspiring (that game of him versus MVP on his stream is an easy example), and he's also one of the most rational and intelligent players out there. In interviews, he might make bold / brunt statements but he always has a reason for everything he says and can defend his position. A true evil genius

Jinro: our foreigner hero, and one of the best terrans in the world. His game-sense, overall strategies, and control are all inspiring, but his ability to play a macro Terran style is unrivaled. More so than any of that, you can tell from his interviews that he's a really genuinely nice guy. Jinro is also the first and only pro I've ever played against, and facing a talent of his calibre was just so awesome

HuK: hilarious guy, and another inspiring Protoss player. As the last foreigner in the GSL, I hope he goes all the way in Code A, or at least makes the finals so he can pick an easier Up and Down match. 

Minigun: my favorite streamer. Another player with really impressive game sense, and shows that APM is not what makes a player great. His control is so good, but he makes it seem so casual and relaxed when he plays. Can't wait to see him play at MLG / the NASL if he gets in!

Various other favorites:

PainUser - watch any of his games from MLG and you'll see why he's awesome

Socke - best protoss in Europe (besides White Ra) and his PvP is just so impressive. If anyone wants to see any insane game, watch him versus Jinro from MLG Dallas Game 2 on Desert Oasis (tv.majorleaguegaming.com and then search Socke)

Kiwikaki - really innovative player, mow-raw-durs, brought us many of the best games earlier this year (his series versus EGMachine in the Reddit Invitational which included the famous blink stalkers sniping two hatches, the hive, and then recalling his entire army out of Machine's main for zero losses and his series versus mouzMorrow where they mined out metalopolis)",c1j9ysw,True,t3_fx2cf,1299225847,t3_fx2cf,False,t5_2qpp6,Old Generations,t1_c1j9ysw,5,0

During the Cold War, USAFE was a fight-in-place fighter force postured for a large-scale conflict. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, it has transitioned to an Air Expeditionary Force with a mobile and deployable mix of people and resources that can simultaneously operate in multiple locations.

Its role in Europe and Africa has expanded from warfighting to include humanitarian and peacekeeping operations, as well as other non-traditional contingencies throughout its area of responsibility.

In peacetime, USAFE trains and equips U.S. Air Force units pledged to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

The problem was that the Serbs flee into Serbia and the Albanians flee to Albania. There were no reporters on the inner Serbian border but on the border to Albania so it looked more dramatic than it was. Yes there were massacres but committed by both parties. The KLA attacked Serbian villages and kidnapped and massacred Serbs that's why the Serbian government called in the special police and the special police in turn massacred Albanians. It was a classic land grab conflict.

The worst ethnic cleansing and massacres happened after NATO took over. The KLA went full throttle to expel everybody non-Albanian from Kosovo. Gipsies, Serbs, Bosniaks and other minorities. They burned down several thousand year old churches. The Kosovo administration e.g. moved Gipsy camps to an area that is poisoned by lead. The EU even recently admitted that the guy they made head of Kosovo was trading the organs of massacred people.

The EU now realises that they made a big mistake by not only protecting the Albanians but handing them the Kosovo. All leading government figures are involved in organised criminal actions.

That's not true.  They know they can get away with charging men more because they are men.  You might say, the more opportunistic their risk estimates, the more money they make.  I'd happily submit to a driving test, which would put me in the 95% percentile of all drivers, to lower my insurance premiums.  Of course, they don't offer this opportunity, because it would cut into their profits.

Please don't try to tell me insurance agencies care about me, I'm not an idiot, really.

&gt;The more accurate their risk estimates, the more money they make.

The more discriminatory their risk estimates, the more money they make.

There are two factors here:

1) men are disposable and are not thought to have any power, so we can't complain about this discrimination

2) it's expensive to force men and women to do road tests to determine their premiums, so competitive businesses cannot afford to do it.

Most foreigners have a hard time understanding the dynamic mix of urban and rural that are typically adjacent due to the rise of suburbs. Everything is spread out. Major cities are farther apart. Streets are wider. Lanes are wider. Suburbs rule the land. E.g. a city block from major intersection to major intersection is 10 times bigger in suburbia than in downtown urban centers. Outside downtown, there are no bike lanes and many times no sidewalks. Even in rush hour, using the bus takes at least twice as long as driving yourself. Many people have a mixed commute where they drive to the nearest bus station and ride public transit the rest of the way into the city. 

On the other hand, many people live in areas and commute where high suspension or 4x4 ability are necessary throughout the year. Many of my peers and myself have relatives spread out across our home state. It's typically a 5 hour drive to the other city they live in.

Let me start by saying that there is a wide variety of approaches for looking at individual rights as the legitimate basis of political order.  A rights based regime can be based on natural law (Locke), the categorical imperative (Kant), utility (Mill), or even some notion of the general will in social contract theory (Rousseau).  While some of these different approaches frame their discussion around the divine, such as Locke, there is nothing about the idea of rights that requires they must be.  Locke was particularly in vogue during the time of writing the Declaration of Independence, and heavily inspired American thinking in that period.  In other places the theoretical inspiration for rights has been different.  In Europe for example, approaches to rights are heavily influenced by Kant.

There are issues that I would like to address with your second paragraph.  First the phrase 'unalienable rights' is more of rhetorical twist than an empirical description of reality.  Rights are routinely abridged, even in a liberal democracy.  It is the circumstances surrounding the abridgement of rights.  Hate speech laws are clear examples of the abridgement of freedom of speech rights.  Furthermore, some people are of the view that rights are hierarchical, with some rights open to derogation (i.e. freedom of speech), and others not open to derogation (right to life).

Additionally, your second paragraph makes the assertion that we need a higher power or creator to believe in a set of laws, or a supreme set of laws.  This is quite a leap.  There are a variety of reasons people could choose to follow ranging from calculated self interest, to respect for traditional institutions, to an inherent belief in the laws' legitimacy, to a sense that the law is an important part of ones identity.  People often make the argument that religion is needed to establish compliance with the law, but piety has little to do with whether one abides with the law.  If this claim were true, then our most pious periods in history would have seen very little to no crime.

Finally, the last bit in your second paragraph asks how can there be any laws that supercede the laws of men.  I guess what your asking is how can there be hierarchy in laws, i.e. constitutional laws as above state law.  The quick answer to this is legitimacy.  The more broad and comprehensive a legislative  project is, the more likely it is able to garner institutional legitimacy and broad assent.  This is why constitutional amendments can be seen as titanic legislative mega projects - such amendments can only be achieved through an immensely broad and comprehensive legislative project.  The supremacy of one law over another is captured by the legitimacy of the institution.  And because the U.S. constitution is seen as the preeminent source of political legitimacy in the United States, it reigns supreme.

In short, law, and the notion of rights, needs no divine order to be well grounded.

Anarchism is void of ruler, in the sense of being void of hierarchies of subjugation. Thus not just government (or necessarily including government). Wealth can be such a hierarchy. A monarchy is not anarchist, neither was Somalia a few years ago. Anomie is the lack of social norms/law, and is very much contrary to anarchism, which sprung from the norms/beliefs of the enlightenment, those of classical liberalism.

Creating a society that maximizes liberty (without necessary emphasis on individual) is fairly what anarchism has always been about, with focus on the cultural vestige that is the assumed need of a ruler.

*Sorry, went off topic below. The point of this post is already reached.*

There's one exception to the above, and that's the recent development of anarcho-capitalism, in america called liberalism, in europe this word is still used in the classical sense, which every strand of anarchic thinking reject as non-anarchic, since it's not against subjugation or such hierarchies. It's just against a set government. So if powerful interests subjugate people to their will, that's fine, but they must not be formally elected. This is not difficult to imagine because practically everyone of any ideology recognize the influence of powerful businesses over government decisions. The effects on people are not too difficult to imagine either. Imagine that you make average wage, work average hours, in an average city. Now use your consumer-vote to purchase a better society. If you are concerned about fair workplaces (such as your own) then you need to know for each product you buy/vote on what the workplace conditions that brand represents. Also the subcontractors for that brand that made the product, and their subcontractors and sources for ingredients, and transporters and so on. Because there will be no regulation saying that there's a minimum standard that you can expect. There's also no regulation saying that it should be easy for consumers to find this information, or hard to fake it. Probably there are more concerns for you than workplace fairness, like possible long term health effects of eating products that have come into contact with the new cheaper grease that the sub-sub contractor started using in their factory. You need to be on top of this for every product you place in your basket. (Some other concerns that government presently regulate for you: monopolization, collusion, market division, barred entry, tragedy of the commons, price gouging, pollution, waste, nature/wildlife preservation, antiquities preservation, unethical/child/slave labour, discrimination, occupational safety and health, employment contracts, unfair dismissal, labour unions, company transparency, market transparency, tying, product safety, product information labeling, production standards, development approvals...)

Americans haven't been clamoring for diesels because our fuel is so comparatively inexpensive--and diesel engines cost so much more to manufacture. Diesel engines cost more because they require added equipment such as a turbocharger to make power levels close to a gas engine. They also need heavier-duty internal components to stand up to higher compression ratios. The time it takes to ""pay back"" the $1500 to $3000 cost premium of a diesel engine with fill-ups at the pump, is very long at current U.S. fuel prices. Consider a hypothetical $20,000 gas car that gets 30 mpg (3.33 gallons per 100 miles). Check the diesel engine option for $1500 and you'd see a 30 percent efficiency improvement (39 mpg or 2.56 g/100m). Over a 15,000-mile year, the diesel will save about 115 gallons. With our fuel prices, it would take more than four years to make back that $1500 investment. At six bucks a gallon for Euro diesel versus seven for gas, the payback is less than two years.

First of all, as others have pointed out, even in the US there is a line drawn where speech is no longer legal, we simply draw that line at a different point than Europeans do. Where ever you draw that line there will be controversy, in Europe there is controversy over when it becomes hate speech. In the US we have controversy over things like wikileaks, freedom of the press, Sarah Palin drawing a cross hair over Giffords. What is important to realize here is that we still draw a line, and that there is still controversy anywhere near that line, the argument is really where do we draw the line, not whether we should draw the line.

What I see as the strongest reason to prohibit hate speech is really that language shapes ideas very strongly. Making it illegal wont remove hate speech, it will simply limit the growth by reducing exposure. People will still have their strong emotions, but limiting hate speech will make people control themselves the same way they don't ram someone when they get cut off on the freeway.

The US supports a great deal of freedom because of our history, our revolution against what was seen as an oppressive government shaped our constitution. Granting freedoms is seen as a way to limit oppression from a malicious government. In the same way that limiting hate speech can limit the growth of hate and hateful ideas, limits on speech can limit the growth of any idea, even good ones. There is also the possibility that some groups should be hated, we generally try to protect groups based on things which they can't control such as gender or race. Politically correct views of gender and race can however make it harder for people to accept that there are differences, and limiting speech on these subjects limits how people think about these subjects by creating the assumption that we are the same.

I think that the laws regarding speech, like all laws should be mutable, and changed to fit the current social, cultural, and political environment.

Somehow I feel that women are often likely to want to put their own life on hold for their parents, and men less. I really think it will just make you miserable, and your son needs your full attention at that age. Being a mother is hard enough. And if you're not planning to be a stay-at-home mother be wary of anything that will put off going back to work.

I'm sorry, but I just think even though it's a horrible situation, this is a trap you shouldn't fall into.

Religious or religiously inspired buildings are just that: Buildings. You can appreciate the architecture and cultural value without buying into the beliefs of the people who constructed them or visit them for religious reasons. It's not like entering a church or temple automatically converts you to that religion. You're not endorsing that religion by doing so. If you're with religious people like your gf and her family, let them do their thing while you take a look around.

There are lots of cathedrals here in Germany, and tons of interesting religious buildings all over Europe. Whenever I'm a new city and have some free time, I make a point of visiting these places. There are no entrance fees, I don't cross myself and splash holy water on my face when I go in. Simply standing in a cathedral and taking in the craftsmanship of the architects and builders hundreds -- sometimes over a thousand -- years ago is pretty awesome. Yes, it's weird to think they put in decades of hard work into something for the glory of something imaginary.

The funny thing for me is how the concept of ""the criminal mind"" has taken hold in the US and almost nowhere else. The US has the highest rates of incarceration in the world, the strictest sentences of the western world[1] and yet, somehow, this doesn't seem to make the US any less prone to crime, especially violent crime.

The US governments mentality towards prison doesn't work (the war on drugs is an astounding example on its own), and it doesn't even reduce recidivism compared to western Europe. It's also worth noting that it's common (especially in northern Europe) for offenders to be subjected to almost indefinite psychiatric care rather than being put into a prison if the person is considered not to change in prison after doing violent crimes.

There's also a fair amount of research done on what prevents recidivism with regards to how the incarceration is served, and it's one of the reasons why several European countries now have it set up so the last years of long sentences (which in Norway would be 6+ years as an example) are set to be served in very open areas where prisoners have to get up in the morning, go to work, buy food and generally live a ""normal"" life.  There is a rather successful program in Norway right now, showing marked improvement over already pretty decent recidivism rates and most of it seems to stem from resocializing the ""institutionalized"" prisoner.

You said currencies appreciate against other currencies, which of course they do, but when one appreciates against latter the other depreciates against the former.

Isso é bem improvável. Cobrança tem que vir sim, mas daqueles que podem cobrar e mudar alguma coisa, no próprio país. Acho difícil os europeus ou americanos criticarem a Copa do Brasil do ponto de vista da melhoria sem levantarem a questão de que a Copa não deveria ser aqui no primeiro lugar. A cobrança vem do povo brasileiro, aquele que vai ter que arcar com as dívidas e dores de cabeça dessa monstruosidade.

Mas eu concordo com o que você disse e falei justamente isso. Disse pessimismo porque na minha opinião a cobrança virá um dia daqui de dentro e as coisas se resolverão. Não acho que a Copa vai para outro país. Logicamente para o pior da população e dos cofres nacionais, mas a Copa do Brasil vai se realizar.

Como você disse tem que se mudar radicalmente o plano. Cidades sedes mais próximas, estádios que já existem, planos realistas. Seria uma pena alienar o resto do país, mas este já está alienado a séculos, não será agora que isso vai se resolver. Também é ingênuo considerar o Brasil como um simples país e não pensar nas dimensões dele. Fazer jogo em Porto Alegre e depois em Natal é como jogar em Moscou e depois Londres. O Brasil é do tamanho da Europa, nem lá se conseguiria tal feito logístico, imagina aqui.

Porto Alegre, Curitiba, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte e Salvador são, na minha opinião, as únicas cidades que deveriam ser sedes. Elas possuem times expressivos em âmbito nacional e, principalmente, perspectiva de investimento. Não adianta fazer estádio em Brasília para o Gama jogar depois, time que nem 10 mil torcedores deve ter. Nem adianta investir em Cuiabá e Manaus quando o estádio de São Paulo consome mais e mais dinheiro público.

O melhor dos cenários seria, para mim, o governo desistir desta copa e explicar o porque: ""O País possui outros interesses sociais e econômicos e não se sujeitará às exigências da FIFA em detrimento da própria população e futuro"". Obviamente isso nunca sairia da boca de nenhum político, ainda menos da administração que herdou a ""Copa do Lula"". Considerando que essa Copa terá sim que ser realizada, tanto por obrigação já com a população que a espera, tanto pela reputação do país que tem que ser conservada, a única forma que vejo dela ocorrer sem desesperos é a diminuição do número de sedes e de fantasias com os estádios.

The thing hé says is that he ""..does not hate muslims but only hates Islam."". 

Now, him being prosecuted for his statements is not something I agree upon. As a matter of fact, it's something almost all Dutch people (including the 'left') don't agree upon. Furthermore, from a legal point of view it's incredibly unlikely that he will actually be convicted.

That does not take away the fact that I think that a big part of his statements on Islam are despicable and are, as a matter of fact, islamophobia. A few examples:

-The plans to ban people with headscarves from buses, which I mentioned before

-Proposal to implement a tax on headscarves. Note, he didn't use the Dutch word 'hoofddoek', he said 'kopvod'. This means, literally translated, a rag used to cover an animal's head.

-Comparing the Quran to Mein Kampf

-Stating that 'millions of muslims should be evicted from the European Union', while there are only 16 million of them living here

-Calling Muhammed a 'barbaric mass murderer' and Turkish prime minister an idiot

-Plans to stop immigration from all Muslim countries (which is plain and simple discrimination prohibited by the EU treaty and European Charter of Human Rights)

Now, it's horrible that he's being threatened. It's true that there are (quite a lot of) violent Muslims. But still, Geert Wilders is a loose cannon and I fear for the day he actually gets in power.

Random racism, racism where you are walking down a street, or are on transit, or in a bar. I doubt there are many here who have ever experienced this feeling. One would have to assume that this negativity directed towards another would cause great emotional pain. You have people in school looking at you differently, and saying things to you because you 'get a free ride'.

I personally believe that we, as in the Americas in general, should study about the First Nations people. In schools from an early age, it is part of our rich history. It isn't until we understand our history and learn from this lands original inhabitants that harmony will come to be. The people who gravitate towards your central cities streets are there to numb themselves. They are in limbo, they can't have a heart on the reserve, and they can't adapt to the city. There lacks serious social programs to prevent this from happening, instead of being proactive the government has given them money and poor living conditions. Now the government is being reactive because they have the strain of having crime and addiction issues.

Apple does the same thing. The iPad, while having finely crafted apps, does not deliver a very good web experience. Flash is still missing and more advanced ""HTML5"" runs like CRAP. Apple markets the iDevices as ""Post-PC era"" devices, but you still NEED a Mac or PC to use them. The data on the devices is sandboxed and they don't interact with eachother.

Do you have some source for that, or is it just your intuition?  It doesn't really seem like a level playing field for debate when all you have to do is provide skepticism and I'm the one tracking down all the data.  You seem mainly concerned with defending your beliefs from criticism instead of providing any evidence that would convince me.

&gt;I did cite evidence, from Brian Blase and Rea S. Hederman, Jr.

&gt;Ah, so you're allowed to post partisan sources, but I am not.

Weak evidence, if that's all you can find.  From the Heritage Foundation, with no actual comprehensive analysis of the entire bill, citing a CBO study (the one I linked to) that contradicts the entire point they're trying to make.  And point out to me which of my sources are ""partisan"".

&gt;That administrator cherry picked two examples

He simply cited the most recent two health care examples.

&gt;he ignored the overestimates of cost savings and underestimates of spending the CBO is typically shown to engage in:

Your three links basically refer to three memes: 1) ACA is understating its impact on the deficit by funding 7 years of benefits with 10 years of taxes. See refutation [here](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2011/01/health-care_reform_doesnt_have.html). Funding and Spending are carefully matched in all years except 2013, and in the decade after the 10-year forecast, it is projected to save an additional $1 trillion, 2) The cost of ACA has already jumped by $115 billion.  See refutation [here](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/05/discretionary_spending_and_the.html), and 3) Because the long-term cost of Medicare was underestimated back in 1970, that means the CBO makes inaccurate predictions.  Another good note [here](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/03/notes_on_cbo_skepticism.html) from Klein.

My main question to respond to all of your skepticism is- can you find me a better source of non-partisan cost projections?

&gt;As of now, Medicare has something like a $34 trillion unfunded liability. That is how much more Medicare money the government has promised than it has budgeted. That's about 30 Iraq wars. The average Medicare recipient now collects 2 to 3 times more than they pay in. It's a complete Ponzi scheme.

There's no denying that we have a massive health care cost growth problem throughout our economy, and that that is playing havoc with our budget.  But eliminating Medicare would simply move that problem from the government to the private sector.  As to that $34 trillion liability (actually [$23.5 trillion](https://www.cms.gov/ReportsTrustFunds/downloads/tr2010.pdf), but what's $10 trillion between friends?), about $7.2 trillion is due to GWB's unfunded Medicare Part D, so you can't really blame the entire Medicare system for the fiscal irresponsibility of our former president.  And according to the Medicare Trustees, ACA actually decreased that long-term liability by $11 trillion, so it's easy to see that this is fixable given the right legislation.

&gt;Not good enough. It is that laziness that generates typically underestimated costs.

But one ""WebMemo"" from a conservative think tank with no hard numbers is good enough for you?

&gt;Not if their premiums will be more than the fine of around $700 for not signing up for insurance, which will be the case for everyone who has to choose between higher premiums and coverage, or $700 and coverage, which is a huge chunk of the population.

I'm just telling you what the CBO expects.  They take these things into account.  And the reason the CBO referred to the 2009 document wasn't ""laziness"", it was because the legislation that passed was largely the same as the legislation under consideration in late 2009.

...Brief points on the remainder of your post, which is really long:

* Health care has changed a lot over the last 100 years.  There are a lot more options, and the options are much more expensive.  We've also come a long way in providing health care for the poor, which had very little access to health care 100 years ago.

* It isn't ""government control"" that increases supply, it's government subsidy.

&gt; In 2009, The most authoritative study of charter schools was conducted by the Center for Research on Education Outcomes (CREDO) at Stanford University. The report is the first detailed national assessment of charter schools. It analyzed 70% of the nation's students attending charter schools and compared the academic progress of those students with that of demographically matched students in nearby public schools. The report found that 17% of charter schools reported academic gains that were significantly better than traditional public schools; 46% showed no difference from public schools; and 37% were significantly worse than their traditional public school counterparts.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_school#United_States

http://credo.stanford.edu/

This is also pretty interesting:

Dronkers and Robert (2003). *The Effectiveness of Public and Private Schools from a Comparative Perspective*. European University Institute, Florence.

&gt; Our analysis shows clearly that private government-dependent schools are more effective than comparable public schools with the same students, parents and social composition ... Our analysis also reveals that independent private schools are less effective than public schools with the same students, parents and social composition.

In the US, private government-dependent schools are known as charter schools.

If you can access the whole study, the literature review in this paper is really good:

Levin (1998) *Educational vouchers: Effectiveness, choice, and costs*. Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, 17(3), 373–392.

Highlights:

&gt; The findings indicate that: (1) results among numerous studies suggest no difference or only a slight advantage for private schools over public schools in student achievement for a given student, but evidence of substantially higher rates of graduation, college attendance, and college graduation for Catholic high school students; (2) evidence is consistent that educational choice leads to greater socioeconomic (SES) and racial segregation of students; and (3) evidence does not support the contention that costs of private schools are considerably lower than those of public schools, but the costs of an overall voucher infrastructure appear to exceed those of the present system.

...

&gt; The first major study by Coleman, Hoffer, and Kilgore [1982] compared a cross section of 10th grade students in public and private (mainly Catholic) schools, controlling for race and socioeconomic background. They found that students in private schools had slightly higher achievement ... But their results were criticized as overstatements of the private school effects because of inadequate controls for selection bias and other problems in the statistical design ... Purported adjustments for some of these problems reduced considerably or eliminated the private school advantages.

...

&gt; Longitudinal results based on sophomore-to-senior changes found smaller private school advantages ...

...

&gt; More recent statistical studies have also found no differences in achievement or only minimal differences.",c1jbs1j,True,t1_c1jbr5e,1299260898,t3_fwjf3,True,t5_2cneq,,t1_c1jbs1j,2,0

Now lets get down to it: Climate warming started long before the ""Industrial Revolution"" and the invention of the internal combustion engine. Global warming began 18,000 years ago as the earth started warming its way out of the Pleistocene Ice Age-- a time when much of North America, Europe, and Asia lay buried beneath great sheets of glacial ice.

Earth's climate and the biosphere have been in constant flux, dominated by ice ages and glaciers for the past several million years. We are currently enjoying a temporary reprieve from the deep freeze.

Approximately every 100,000 years Earth's climate warms up temporarily. These warm periods, called interglacial periods, appear to last approximately 15,000 to 20,000 years before regressing back to a cold ice age climate. At year 18,000 and counting our current interglacial vacation from the Ice Age is much nearer its end than its beginning.

Climate warming during Earth's current interglacial warm period has greatly altered our environment and the distribution and diversity of all life.

For example:  Approximately 15,000 years ago the earth had warmed sufficiently to halt the advance of glaciers, and sea levels worldwide began to rise.

By 8,000 years ago the land bridge across the Bering Strait was drowned, cutting off the migration of men and animals to North America.

Since the end of the Ice Age, Earth's temperature has risen approximately 16 degrees F and sea levels have risen a total of 300 feet! Forests have returned where once there was only ice.

[source](http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/ice_ages/)

During ice ages our planet is cold, dry, and inhospitable supporting few forests but plenty of glaciers and deserts. Like a spread of collosal bulldozers, glaciers have scraped and pulverized vast stretches of Earth's surface and completely destroyed entire regional ecosystems not once, but several times. During Ice Ages winters were longer and more severe and ice sheets grew to tremendous size, accumulating to thicknesses of up to 8,000 feet!. They moved slowly from higher elevations to lower driven by gravity and their tremendous weight. They left in their wake altered river courses, flattened landscapes, and along the margins of their farthest advance, great piles of glacial debris.

During the last 3 million years glaciers have at one time or another covered about 29% of Earth's land surface or about 17.14 million square miles (44.38 million sq. km.) . What did not lay beneath ice was a largely cold and desolate desert landscape, due in large part to the colder, less-humid atmospheric conditions that prevailed.

During the Ice Age summers were short and winters were brutal. Animal life and especially plant life had a very tough time of it. Thanks to the climate warming, that has all now changed, at least temporarily.

In the 1970s concerned environmentalists like Stephen Schneider of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado feared a return to another ice age due to manmade atmospheric pollution blocking out the sun.

Since about 1940 the global climate did in fact appear to be cooling. Then a funny thing happened-- sometime in the late 1970s temperature declines slowed to a halt and ground-based recording stations during the 1980s and 1990s began reading small but steady increases in near-surface temperatures. Fears of ""global cooling"" then changed suddenly to ""global warming,"" the cited cause: manmade atmospheric pollution causing a runaway greenhouse effect. Yet because the data is still young it can not be proven to be because of man or because of natural changes in our climate. All we can do is study and prevent pollution where we can. Earth history shows us though that the Earth will natural start to cool once again and man will not be able to control it.

Iraq:  Should a true democratic election be held, the country would undoubtedly vote Shi-ite.  The majority is not sunni, it's overwhelmingly shi-ite.  Therefore you would have Iran, Iraq (and also the most oil rich parts of Saudi Arabia are also a Shia majority who would be getting veryexcited) which would all Shi-ite.  They would also (who could blame them) not look too favorably on the US, and most likely turn to china for their oil exports.  From a US global domination point of view, this is a total disaster.

Afganistan:  In my view, this war is mainly about the control of the poppy crops. 92% of the world's heroin comes from Afganistan.

Yet I don't get the impression that Cree is a vibrant language outside of the home and small communities.  Small languages in Europe with a similar number of speakers (Scots Gaelic, Faroese for example) have a very motivated population working to preserve the usage and culture in their language.  

There are Gaelic and Faroese translations of modern children's literature, for example.  (Harry Potter was recently translated, all the books, to Faroese).  It's also possible to get both secondary and university educations in at least some subjects in those languages.  Television carries dubs of popular programs and in Scotland there's a TV channel carrying Gaelic coverage of soccer matches and original programming.

I don't get any of this vibe from indigenous languages in North America, other than maybe Navajo (which has newspapers and magazines written in it) and Inuktitut, which is used by the government at least somewhat as a written language in Nunavut.

================================

It is disappointing to see a Christian fulfill what I would have thought was a tired stereotype: asserting that a rival belief or argument is ultimately based on immorality. Aside from being a conversation-stopper, in today’s world it seems to exude the bunker mentality of a subculture that does not want to sincerely engage with the world around it. Jim Spiegel has written a short article in Christianity Today that implies “New Atheists” are atheists because they cannot overcome their irrational passions. He even goes so far as to suggest that unbelief might be best fought by traditional family values, a conclusion derived from another scholar who claims that many prominent atheists in history had what amount to father issues.

Between the Reformation and the Enlightenment in Europe atheism was generally thought to be the product of immoral and irreligious practices. If you held unorthodox beliefs it was widely believed that this was caused by a sensual desire to live as one pleased, reaching back to the primordial sin of Adam’s pride. Francis Bacon, for example, begins his essay “Of Atheisme” of 1598 with an exegesis of Psalm 14:1, “The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God”. Bacon interpreted the Psalm as saying that an atheist denied God in his heart, and not in his mind, because he wished to live as he pleased, not because he had intellectual reasons to deny God’s existence. After all, if the atheist turned to nature and investigated it rationally, Bacon insisted that he must conclude that an omnipotent being created and now sustained the natural world. The exact same exegetical approach was taken in hundreds of texts in the early modern period. And Jim Spiegel uses the same verse to promote his book, The Making of an Atheist: How Immorality leads to Unbelief, and insists that atheists adopt unbelief because of the non-rational pull of the passions.

The argument that unbelievers and atheists were incapable of virtue was one that died hard in European culture – it was a scandal when Pierre Bayle suggested (1682, Pensées diverses sur le comète de 1680) that an atheist could be virtuous and that a society of atheists could exist. It wouldn’t be until the late nineteenth century that an avowed atheist by the name of Charles Bradlaugh could sit as a Member of Parliament in Britain. As I have written here at Patrol before, Americans still report that they desire politicians with traditional religious values as their representatives, which seems to suggest that politicians who do not believe in a traditional God are somehow untrustworthy or incapable of serving as political representatives because of their unbelief.

When Christians argue that atheists are atheists because of an underlying immorality they seem to be positing a simple relationship between belief and practice that has long since been rejected. At least the return of virtue ethics, perhaps most famously associated with the philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre, has given a philosophically sophisticated account of the relationship between practice and belief in a way that does not reduce the question to an oversimplified – not to say patently false – alternative between morality and immorality. Whatever one makes of MacIntyre’s project, he saw the need to given an account for how the connection between belief and practice was undermined in submitting the Enlightenment philosophy of David Hume, whom he perceived to represent that separation, to philosophical criticism that built upon philosophy’s history. In other words, MacIntyre recognizes that we cannot make an argument today about the relationship between belief and practice without accounting for the history of that relationship’s conception.

Put simply, there is no going back. There can be no pre-critical, “naive” argument about belief and practice – linking unbelief to immorality – that simply ignores the work of modern critical philosophy and its history. We cannot settle for seemingly neat solutions – in this case dismissals – in place of critical thinking; nor can we accept terms of debate that end dialogue rather than foster it. Again, even if you do not agree with MacIntyre, at least his position is taken critically and is articulated in such a way that it actually opens itself up to be contested in a rational way. Arguing that atheism is the product of immorality as Spiegel does is a shallow way of shortcutting the work of actually engaging with the arguments of others, especially those with alternative beliefs, on sincere terms. If we cannot convince a partner in dialogue of our position, we cannot maintain today that another position is wrong simply because we find it to be “non-rational”. This would seem to be all the more true given the fact that what one person calls non-rational, another calls conviction.

As Christians when we flatten dialogue into a stale debate we only contribute to the work of enclosure, of sealing up our ears so that we can no longer hear any divergent voice, let alone the Voice that we faithfully presume speaks to us. In order to have ears to hear, and eyes to see, we must be vigilant against all forms of distortion, including the distortion of philosophical simplification and prejudice, of silencing those we disagree with under the false banner of irrationality and immorality.",c1jciq8,True,t1_c1jc47u,1299269634,t3_fxc4n,False,t5_2qh2p,Nihilist,t1_c1jciq8,5,0

If you check the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent#Number_of_continents) again, it does state that:

Which is what we use. Then, we do call it ""Oceania"" instead of Australia, as pointed out in the next paragraph:

&gt; The terms Oceania or Australasia are sometimes substituted for Australia to denote a continent encompassing the Australian mainland and various islands of the Pacific Ocean not part of other continents.

Iberia = Spain + Portugal.

So I guess it's really a historical thing... pretty arbitrary to be honest. I would find the 7 continent model to be the more logical one though, as I see no reason to leave Antarctica out just because it's not inhabited.

The big difference with Harper as opposed to the Liberals is the Liberals were fiscally responsible and ensured that we collected enough tax revenue to support our spending. Harper cuts taxes while raising spending. Dumbasses think this is great, because they get all the stuff they used to get, but also pay less taxes. People with one or two functioning brain cells realize that while right now things might be fine, sooner or later the bill is going to come due, and either taxes will go up, or services will come down. You can see the endgame of these policies RIGHT NOW if you cared to open your ignorant eyes and see what is happening in the USA and parts of Europe. Austerity budgets, riots, protests, teacher strikes, bankrupt cities and states, battles with unions, it goes on and on. Canada has been isolated from this chaos because up until now, we effectively kept dumbasses like you and your dumbass leaders (Harper) from ever gaining power here.

Harper is increasing our relevance on the international field?

Do you mean by pandering to U.S. and Israeli interests? Since when has Canada been an avid supporter of Israel? I suppose our influence in those two countries may be going up, however it is going down in the rest of the world. Remember when we lost out on a U.N. security council seat to fucking PORTUGAL? That was unprecedented. 

&gt;“The Harperites like to intone variations on Groucho Marx,” Robert Fowler, one of this country’s most experienced and respected diplomats, told me with a laugh when we talked on the telephone last October. “‘We are a country of principles. We wouldn’t join a club that would have us as a member.’ Or vice versa.” During his thirty-eight-year career in public service, Fowler was the foreign policy adviser to three prime ministers: Pierre Trudeau, John Turner, and Brian Mulroney. He was also deputy minister of defence, and Canada’s longest-serving ambassador to the UN, where he represented Canada on the Security Council in 1999 and 2000.

&gt;“The truth,” he said, “is that it will be twenty years before Canada serves again on the council, which means we will have collectively lost all direct knowledge of what takes place at that important table. We have been able to keep that knowledge alive in the past. That’s gone. Now we will get most of our information indirectly from US sources, and the US hates the UN.

&gt;“We’re more comfortably into ‘little Canada’ now: out of the picture, and stridently happy to be so.”

This is absurd. If he existed, he may not have said anything at all like it, and some future believer added it because it sounded nice, or conflated some other mythical figure's quote (Mithras, anyone?).

But, if he did say something like that, the man spoke what, some form of Aramaic? The trouble here is that what you quoted was a translation.

Even ignoring translation problems (some languages don't have terms for certain concepts while others do), it's unclear what might be idiomatic. It's nice to think that context would help here... today, someone who says something snarky of metaphorical might be inclined to emphasize it with quote marks or italics, but whoever wrote this down however long ago could not do that... those things weren't invented until later.

The person who wrote it down in greek may not have spoken aramaic well, losing that idiom itself, and thinking it just cryptic and mystical.

I know nothing about the US courts but in the UK, whilst the burden of proof lies, (to demonstrate that one is a refugee), with the applicant, the burden of proof is, ""a reasonable likelihood"", i.e. a low standard. The UK Home Office, or more relevantly, UK Border Agency, (UKBA) is generally unable to instruct expert witnesses on country situations for various reasons, (although we do have a relatively respected County of Information Origin Information Service-sorry nothing public domain on Honduras). Basically that means if someone can turn up and talk confidently about a subject and not do too badly under cross-examination, (i.e. not speculate too much, comment outside of their claimed area of expertise, deviate from reliable background material e.g. US State Dept Report on human rights, give a genuine opinion on whether or not they think an applicant is lying etc.) they will be accepted as an expert and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, (in your case evidence relied upon by the US govt) they should be home and dry. In terms of engaging the convention on Particular Social Group, (PSG) grounds, the EU case law on the subject should enable your client/friend to demonstrate that he falls into this category provided that he can show that his group can be defined independently from the persecution and that there is not a sufficiency of protection from the Honduran govt, (it's not quite that simple but I doubt you will find an Immigration Judge or equivalent that will consider it in more complicated terms). In short, check out what the other side, i.e. the immigration authorities are relying on, (the English speaking countries tend to rely on each others' country of origin information although I suspect Honduras is more of a US 'issue' so there might not be much around) and then think about what your friend/client has to prove to the appropriate standard- you might already know 'experts' but are aiming too high, (obviously no criticism intended, you just want to do this properly).

How did they get to own the land in the first place? Well, I guess tens of thousands of years of occupation. Then when the English came, they recognized this ownership and created something called the Royal Proclamation which enshrined this ownership in British law. So from then on, anytime a European settler wanted land, they had to essentially purchase from the First Nation that owned the land they coveted.

Science is political.  It pretends it isn't, but politics have a huge impact on what gets published.  And the trend over the past several decades has been to downplay the differences between races or even to deny the existence of race altogether.  No surprise, considering the social events that have happened over the same time period and the criticism that anybody who produces contrary results will face.

If I gave a biologist 50 Koreans and 50 Ethiopians and offered him $100 000 for each significant genetic difference he could find between the groups, I have a feeling I'd wind up writing a very large check.  It's entirely true that genetic variation differs on the individual scale by more than it does on the group scale, but that's irrelevant.  The differences still exist.  And while the individual variation is spread out randomly over the entire genome, the group differences are concentrated in certain areas, producing reliable results.

The problem with defining race is that we never know where to draw the lines, and because of this people assume that no lines exist.  It would be very difficult to distinguish between French and Germans and Italians, for example, but a Western European label would be too broad and have too many inconsistencies.  But if you compare any one of those groups to Cambodians, the differences are obvious.

If you compare Norweigans to Sri Lankans, you'll find that they have different skin color, body hair, hair color, hair texture, height, eye color, facial structure, muscle type distribution, genetic defect predispositions and a whole hell of a lot more.  If the Norweigans move to Sri Lanka and live among the Sri Lankans (but don't interbreed), their great-grandchildren will still be significantly different.

Yes, if you want to call the EU a sovereign state, then it is the biggest economy in the world. But its political cohesion is tenuous at best, its economic union nearly fell apart during the Financial Crisis, and it has barely has a ""European"" military to speak of. Its military spending is only ""exponentially"" smaller if you look at EU spending. If you look at the spending of each state individually for their domestic armies as well, it ranges from about 1-2% of GDP, with a couple exceptions. Overall quite a bit smaller yes, but not miniscule in comparison. You must also take into account that most of the EU is a part of NATO, and so partly rely on US military protection. Were that to disappear, spending would increase modestly. 

I stand by what I said about the world. Not all that shit would happen, but some of it would. See some of my other comments for details. 

The US built the UN. I don't know how you can dispute that. It was the direct successor to the League of Nations, which was invented by Wilson (though we didn't join, not Wilson's fault). Roosevelt coined the term ""United Nations."" Hell the thing is fucking headquartered in the US. 

I will agree, however, that the US has had a sketchy at best commitment to the international treaties created by the UN. It is one of the supreme ironies of world politics in the last few decades that the US has turned on its own creation. I don't know if it beliefs about American Exceptionalism, fear of being subordinate to an extra-national power, strong lobbyist groups, or whatever caused this, but its a bit disingenuous. In the US's defense, I would argue that it does mine safety, child, economic, social, cultural, civil, and political rights, anti-discrimination, and genocide prevention better than most of the world, even if we haven't signed the treaty, and I would also argue that realities matter more than accession to this or that treaty. Indigenous and Sexual orientation, and that torture stuff we have some work to do yet. 

Iraq and everything that came with it has murdered US international legitimacy. I'm more inclined to think it was the deluded decision of a small cadre of neocon politicians motivated by false information/corporate interests/oil/freedom-spreading/[insert inadequate justification] than it was an act representative of 6 decades of US grand strategy. It was a stupid fucking thing to do, but I won't characterize the overall US influence on the world but one rather large mistake. 

I wish the world could work peacefully and multilaterally. I think its heartening that Europe, Japan, and most of the Americas has learned to work out problems amongst themselves without the use of force. But the rest of the world doesn't appear to be there yet. Until they get there, the US military will continue to be the most important (but not only) force for international stability.

(Which, BTW, used polyphase generators Westinghouse had bought from Europe. So if Tesla invented it all himself, what was that all about?) Those two guys laid the foundations for AEG and ASEA (now ABB), both of which are still giants in the business.

Most of Tesla's inventions were independently developed at the same time. Tesla is **more** well known than the other guys because of the 'War of the currents', which was more a creation of the US media than a real battle. AC won and AC would always have won. You only had that 'war' because Edison was a major player - but only in the USA - who refused to see that AC was better. In Europe there was never really any such 'war'.

In July 1998, federal judge William L. Osteen stated the EPA ""cherry-picked"" data, excluding studies that ""demonstrated no association between environmental tobacco smoke and cancer"", and withholding ""significant portions of its findings and reasoning in striving to confirm its a priori hypothesis"". 

As far as statistics, there are several ways to look at it. ""Risk Attribution and Tobacco-Related Deaths"" by T.D. Sterling, W.L. Rosenbaum, and J.J. Weinkam reveal an overstatement in the American Cancer Society's Cancer Prevention Survey in the neighborhood of 65%, in computing excess deaths. The Office of Technology Assessment calculated the deaths caused by smoking with a few factors. The OTA determines the death rate for people who were part of the CPS sample and never smoked. That rate is then applied to the total population. The hypothetical number of deaths is subtracted from the actual number of deaths, and difference is smoke-related deaths. The approach is valid, if the sample group is roughly the same as the US population. Sterling, Rosenbaum, and Weinkam discovered that it wasn't even close. The sample size was one million men and women. The persons who participated are more affluent than average, overwhelmingly white, married, college graduates, who generally do not have hazardous jobs. Each of these characteristics tends to reduce the death rate of the CPS sample size, which skews the results. 

I'm not saying that there aren't risks inherent to second hand smoke, but there are just too many other factors that come into play that skew the data one way or another. ",c1jdx2l,True,t1_c1jcq67,1299288250,t3_fxfu0,False,t5_2qh1i,,t1_c1jdx2l,1,0

I come into class presenting on Alexander Hamilton and the federalist papers. I boldly tell the class that the support for a series of checks and balances within government as supported by the federalist papers was not actually inspired by Montesquieu, but rather by two Italian philosophers.

Alexander Hamilton was a wealthy and educated upper crust man in the late 1700's and as was normal for the time period invited a series of well-to-do Europeans to come see the American continent and would host them in his home for months at a time.

At the time of the federalist papers Hamilton had two Italian philosophers staying in his home and would often hear them complain and argue about the role of women in the home. They would state that it was hard to discipline one's wife when they were in charge of running the household. They complained that if they were (justly) harsh with their wives their sheets wouldn't get changed or they would be served sub par meals. They would go on about how the different roles between men and women with their subtle areas of overlap made it impossible to completely exercise power in the home as was the man's right.

This, ladies and gentlemen, gave Alexander Hamilton the idea for the separation of powers in the U.S. government and for the series of checks and balances that don't allow one branch to become too powerful.

Before I could say ""April Fools"" my (female) teacher went off on ""Those Italian women, they're firecrackers."" And kept going on and on about how little things shape the world. She got so far into it and so enthusiastic I lost my nerve and sat down. I think she's still teaching that to classes that go through.

TL;DR: I convinced my multiple post doctoral degrees professor that husbands and wives arguing was the inspiration for the federalist papers and checks and balances. She's still teaching it that way.

Exactly - and has it been a wave of theism-bashing in these areas that had this effect (im thinking Scandinavian countries here)? No, it has been education. Not mocking. It's the mocking bit that seems utopian to me. And counter-productive too.

""You raise someone in a primarily atheist culture and they probably will grow up not believing in gods; place them in a different culture and they'll grow up to be slavery loving religious people who don't like seeing women educated.""

Agreed again - but do you think it was education or the mocking of slave owners that got rid of slavery in America? I'm sure slave owners were eventually mocked, but it was education that did the damage (lets not forget that it was once accepted in the scientific community that black people were genetically inferior, were more 'beastly', etc.) When that changed, conceptions about race and slavery changed too. Religion will eventually probably go the same way.

""You can go ahead and push for some kind of middle of the road solution where you have to navigate religious ideas through compromise to achieve small goals.""

Isn't it possible that this middle of the road scenario creates an environment for the further limiting of religion? If we get people agreeing to limit the influence of religion, it seems to me like they might eventually give it up altogether - although if they are limiting the influence of religion in a genuine way, this would no longer really be necessary. It's not that our goals are different, its that our methods are. a less painful transition might well make for an easier transition. Plus the psychological fact that people don't like giving up things when they are aggressively being taken away - noone likes a bully, basically.

""Most people do not think taking jabs at religion will erase stupidity and make everyone super intelligent. If this is how you look at other people, then it's not surprising that your views seem far more reasonable than the absurdity you cobbled together to represent their own.""

Nice ad hominim to finish things off there - stay classy. My point is not that religious people are super-stupid (check your irony meter), it's that the prejudices you seem so eager to eradicate by destroying religious views will probably be replaced by other, secular prejudices. I'm a philosopher, and Kant, who devised a so-called secular moral theory, free from religious influence, produced a homophobic, pro-death penalty (which is seen as quite bad in Europe), often counter-intuitive theory. Likewise, Confucianism and Daoism are not theistic (philosophical Daoism, anyway) and also have many a prejudice in them. This whole point is an aside, but i sometimes wonder whether atheists see religion as the root of all evil, when in reality it is more like a channel that helps humans to deal with stuff we have evolved but find it hard to deal with. We will find other ways to deal with these emotions and concepts without religion. But as I say, this is an aside.

 It does interest me to see how aggressive and uncompromising atheists can be when their conceptions about religion are challenged, even by a fellow atheist. It reminds me of arguing with religious folk - the same stubbornness to even contemplate the possible validity of another viewpoint is usually present no matter who you talk to.

If there is unemployment in Mexico, is a Mexican free to collect unemployment benefits in Canada, and look for work, or just bum around, in the US? There are no internal borders of any type in the EU for EU citizens, and they are all issued an EU passport. Is there a NAFTA passport? Is there one Capital city for NAFTA?

Maybe you don't realize the extent that the EU has formed one entity, have a look at [this mapping of competency](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Lisbon_treaty#Defined_policy_areas), and find me anything comparable that NAFTA provides. The countries in NAFTA have the ability to set their own internal trade policy, while in the EU that is done entirely by the EU Parliament.  When China trades with Canada, they are not trading with the US or NAFTA, and NAFTA makes no ruling on external trade. Yet individual states in the EU have no ability to set trade policy, and it is not possible for another nation to strike a trade deal with one state in the EU, all international trade is done with the EU as a whole.

Also, on that link, have a look at the middle section:

&gt;""Member States cannot exercise competence in areas where the Union has done so.""

It means that all member states cede any sovereignty to make decisions regarding things like internal trade, transportation, freedom, security and justice once the EU has exerted it's authority, and most of those areas have long been under EU jurisdiction. NAFTA has nothing of the sort. 

The individual states in the EU have little more power to set policy than individual states in the US. The comparison to NAFTA is completely off-base.

There is only one possibility to save the encircled U.S.A. troops from total annihilation: that is the honorable surrender of the encircled town. In order to think it over a term of two hours will be granted beginning with the presentation of this note.

If this proposal should be rejected one German Artillery Corps and six heavy A. A. Battalions are ready to annihilate the U.S.A. troops in and near Bastogne. The order for firing will be given immediately after this two hours' term.

All the serious civilian losses caused by this artillery fire would not correspond with the well known American humanity.

The German Commander.

But then McAuliffe realized that some sort of reply was in order. He pondered for a few minutes and then told the staff, ""Well I don't know what to tell them."" He then asked the staff what they thought, and I spoke up, saying, ""That first remark of yours would be hard to beat."" McAuliffe said, ""What do you mean?"" I answered, ""Sir, you said 'Nuts'."" All members of the staff enthusiastically agreed, and McAuliffe decided to send that one word, ""Nuts!"" back to the Germans. McAuliffe then wrote down: 

""To the German Commander, ""Nuts!""

 The American Commander.""

Then yes. If you're just someone living in America or Europe complaining life is bad when you have a house, food, electricity, clothes, and extra money for fun, then no.

If you truly feel like your life is not worth living, put your life to use to help others such as the poor or aid in Africa. At least that way you can use your life to help others and to not only waste your life but the lives you could have saved. No excuse to kill yourself unless it is truly physically agonizing.

GOOD

 - weather
 - environment/geography/space
 - ethnic diversity
 - Medicare (I feel fear and pity for Americans when I read about what they go through)
 - natural resources
 - good workers' rights (compared to the US, though sometimes the balance is perhaps unfairly tipped against smaller employers)
 - less of a class system

BAD

 - socially unprogressive and conservative, compared to a lot of Europe, (though it's getting better, yay for ethics classes and fingers crossed for gay marriage and adult video game certificates)
 - far too many levels of politics (the States should be trimmed right back, and there should be far more homogenisation of legislation, eg abortion should be a right for every Australian, not just those in certain states)
 - too many career politicians, who are not adequately global in their perspective (Gillard included, sadly)
 - supermarket food (full of additives including those that are banned in Europe - Tim Tams have E102 in them - but things have been improving rapidly in recent years)
 - segregated private schools (there's been a huge trend in the UK of private schools going co-ed, but that doesn't seem to be happening here.  I think it's a big factor behind poor female representation on boards and in senior management, as well as why it's taken so long to get paid maternity leave schemes in)
 - distance:  Australia is really isolated (and gets ripped off as a result - a Sydney-London return ticket is usually at least *double* the price of a London-Sydney return ticket)
 - critical infrastructure and housing problems (though these are not unique to Australia)",c1jfb4q,True,t3_fx7uu,1299315523,t3_fx7uu,False,t5_2qh8e,,t1_c1jfb4q,1,0
