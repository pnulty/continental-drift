I'd rather maintain that while it's not really an anarchist society as anyone talks about, market or anti-capitalist ... through adherence to Xeer as a system, the Somali people are living a better life than they had before the collapse of government. I'm willing to entertain the idea that not all stateless societies will be instantly better than governed societies ... but not all methods of governance is automatically *better* than a stateless society. Many people gloss over, or outright have no idea that Somali people are better off economically, in terms of safety, and in terms of civil resolution of grievances than they have been in decades. Leeson's paper on this gives us a lot of insight into the area that many westerners simply don't know.

&gt; Indicators of Somali welfare remain low in absolute terms, but compared to their status under government show a marked advance. Under statelessness life expectancy in Somalia has grown, access to health facilities has increased, infant mortality has dropped, civil liberties have expanded, and extreme poverty (less than $1 PPP/day) has plummeted. In many parts of the country even security has improved. In these areas citizens are safer than they’ve been in three decades (UNDP 2001). Somalia is far from prosperous, but it has made considerable strides since its government collapsed 15 years ago.

The paper is working off of ideas kicked around by DeLong (he of Krugman sidekick fame) and Schleifer, in their ""Princes and Merchants"" work comparing the stateless societies of European history to ruled societies of the time, and progress there in absolute terms, as well as the analysis of Somalia's lack of similarities to Mosselle and Polak's [predatory primitive state model](http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/cwlcwldpp/1158.htm) out of Yale.

1) You are saying it is not a valid reason because it is not true. The fact is that it is true - ask restaurant owners, or compare similar offering in America to offerings in Europe. Educate yourself a little bit before making idealistic comments. They don't tack the tip on automatically because in America it is meant to create an incentive for quality service, which is important in the service industry for repeat business. Those that continually get bad or no tips are not good enough, probably keeping customers away, and will eventually leave (the desired outcome) and someone that can retain customers is hopefully hired. Again, check the service in Europe, and you'll see. This is all predicated on people being intelligent enough to realize the price of their food is set lower because of the savings in wages. Most Americans know this.
 
2) It doesn't matter one bit whether you say it is not acceptable. Not a bit. Why? Because that is the way it is. You don't like it, but that is how wages are set. Wishing it weren't true doesn't change. *Wages are set lower for tip-based jobs.* That is reality no matter how long you close your eyes.
 
3) Yes, you can choose not to pay it. But the practice and principle behind tipping is that you only withhold your tip when they fail to deliver the service properly. You are abusing the system, and in effect stealing, when you fail to tip on properly-delivered services whose prices have been lowered down on the expectation that you tip. 
 
4) Why do you lose? You didn't actually address this one. With the tip system, you pay roughly the same amount (with the option of paying less if the service is delivered improperly), employees work harder so they don't lose tips and thus make the experience better, and more restaurants exists because the are an affordable service for a greater portion of America this way. So why do you lose again? You don't lose money, or choice, by tipping. The only people that lose are the people that render you a service it seems.
 
5) No, you are placing your stupid ideology above the tangible needs of individuals providing you a tip-based service. You think your ideology is more important than their work.

The misunderstanding arises because many people think that, since the smaller engine of a motorcycle consumes less fuel, hence it pollutes less. What is left out of this flawed reasoning is the fact that these engines are less developed, so that less fuel consumption cannot be translated directly into less pollution. The German pedestrian organisation Fuss-Verein has summarised excellently the car-motorcycle pollution comparison, according to the 2006 European and German regulations into the following table[2]:

           NOx     CH     CO

1254369534,28,IAmA,,,28,t1_c0duqgs,t1_c0dusqr,True,0,True,blackblocanarchist,1426060790,False,"- The worst situation I have been in was in Miami, Florida during the Summit of the Americas protests in November, 2003. The Miami protests saw the introduction of the policing model which came to be called the Miami Model, which involves overwhelming use of force against all demonstrators and the deployment of high tech non-lethal weaponry.

A good friend of mine, Jordan Feder, was a protest medic there and was exposed to a combination of capsicum powder and OC powder or other agents, which may have reduced his immune system severely. He contracted meningitis on the way home and died several agonizing days later at the age of 23. He was a vegan gymnast with no prior medical condition. 

Police violence was the worst there than I have ever seen [EDIT: in the United States. Genoa, Italy in 2001 was worse], often against simple marching without a permit, although the Black Bloc did try to tear down the protective fence around the summit. Protesters plans largely fell apart in the face of this, ending in a rout. So, least successful from a protest standpoint and most traumatic personally.

- I have only been arrested twice, in 2002 and 2004, both times as a John Doe [refused to give name or identify self] and released without charges after being held for 38 hours in the first case and 40 hours in the second case.

- I will separate the violence question into two parts, since I know people hold different opinions as to what constitutes violence. First: property destruction. Property destruction usually occurs in two main ways - premeditated attacks on windows, buildings, fences, etc. and ""in the moment attacks"" on police or corporate media vehicles and other objects [setting fires in dumpsters, etc]. I have participated in the past in the first kind, but only in a targeted way, and in the second kind relative to the moment - example would be in Minneapolis for the Republican National Convention in 2008, when a police car tried to drive into a crowd, it got a slashed tire and a smashed window.

Property destruction against mom &amp; pop shops is wrong, and is often the result of a young anarchist not knowing the difference or not caring. 

As for physical violence against people, yes. Planning to go to a demonstration to fight cops is a bad plan, tactically. It always fails - police are better trained, have better equipment and better organization in a street fight. If you try to attack a line of cops you are asking to lose. That said, if an arrest is happening, un-arresting involves physical altercation. In 2002 in DC at an anti-war demo, a cop attacked my friend, so we managed to push him to the ground and grab his baton. I have seen more, but these are limited. Others had involved throwing orange traffic barrels at Secret Service agents, throwing rocks at police lines in Europe, going [homemade] shield wall to shield wall with police. As for kind of fighting, it's mostly grappling, pushing, kicking. And it's rare. The point of a Black Bloc in theory is to take space so that other people won't get attacked and be a presence, or to engage in hit and run direct action. If the cops are fighting you, it's usually because they've cornered you.

Mostly, physical violence occurs as police lines hit lines of protesters and a fight breaks out, or through individual arrests. In DC in 2001 at Bush's first inauguration, we were encircled at 14th and K. Several affinity groups linked arms and formed a wedge, then pushed our way out through police like in a mosh pit. In the process, we knocked over then Chief Ramsey who was standing behind the police line as we pushed through.

There are also instances where neo-nazis are involved at protests, like at anti-fascist demos. For that, gloves are off. Most boneheads are pretty big, but don't know how to fight as a group - they want to square off one on one and box you. They also love to pick fights. So you encircle them, grab any clothing, pull them into the crowd and kick them until they run away. It's more important to make the big tough guy look like a loser than to actually injure him. Some of those demos got pretty out of hand.

Also, I say former Black Bloc anarchist because of one particular fight. There was an anti-immigrant rally where neo-nazis showed up and joined the anti-immigrant crowd, which was mostly ""they took our jobs"" types. We knew who the white supremacists were, and began pointing them out and calling them out as neo-nazis. No fights happened at the demo and it was a good tactic because it really isolated their ability to recruit people and made some of the other people rethink who they were standing with. After the rally, however, a fight broke out on a side street near a parking lot between a neo-nazi and several anarchists. The neo-nazi pulled a knife, which was kicked out of his hand. A bystander, an older man who lived nearby, intervened and punched an anarchist. He got punched back and fell to the ground, bleeding. I was not part of this, but was running over to see what was going on and witnessed this. The whole fight was pointless and served no purpose; the rally was over. The political point was made. 

Seeing that older guy get punched was the last straw: I refused to take part in any more actions that served as a cover for gang-style fighting between neo-nazis and antifascists, because I think there is a point where it just devolves into mindless grudge settling, and innocents get caught up in it.

- My best memory is from Seattle, 1999 at the WTO protests when they announced the opening ceremony was canceled. I was at the convergence space at 420 Denny when that happened. That, or either from Quebec City protests in 2001 when protesters tore down a fence and we were running through the St. Jean-Baptiste neighborhood where residents were offering us water and apples in broken English, or the first inauguration of Bush in 2001, when we made it five feet from charging onto the parade route and there were only 3 arrests within the Bloc. [EDIT: that Black Bloc was probably the best organized I have ever seen, and stayed really mobile, with a very good plan beforehand with several fall back plans, hashed out at a vouched-only spokescouncil meeting the night before.]

- Weirdest memories are the ones in between skirmishes. This used to happen more often, or in smaller towns not used to ""professional"" protest tactics. In Philly during the RNC in 2000, after the first day of protests but before the crazy day of action, everyone took a lunch/dinner break. I was in a pizza shop, as were about 20 anarchists. Four cops walked in and everyone looked at each other. Then the cops ordered pizza and sat down, and everyone just went on eating as if it were accepted that this was neutral ground. 

A similar thing happened when a motorcycle cop waved some of us over to him and explained that this is his job, and his daughter is our age and we both agreed amicably that neither of us had anything personal against the other. The next day, motorcycle cops rammed into our banner as we were marching and a fight broke out.

[EDIT: running into Jon Stewart in Minneapolis after running away from tear gas was also pretty weird.]

Also, when I was arrested in DC in 2002 as a John Doe, I was with my girlfriend. We were getting zip tied, and the cop doing it looked at us and said he could probably get us on the same arrest bus. I replied they'd just split us up any way once we got to processing. He sort made a sympathetic frown, loosened the zip ties and said it would be all right. His superior then relieved him of zip tying people. I ended up in the hospital that night with breathing complications from pepper spray and was released into the custody of a corrections officer. The CO said he couldn't stand the cops at Cellblock B where the holding tank was, then took my paperwork and left it on some random cop car at the hospital. When he handed me over back to holding, he told them he had never been given any paperwork. I was held longer, but no charges were filed against me.

Only socialists would ever come to that completely false conclusion.  The fact is that free markets are in fact natural to mankind.  No violence is necessary to ""create"" it.

*""In a profound sense, the free market is the method and society ""natural"" to man; it can and does therefore arise ""naturally"" without an elaborate intellectual system to explain and defend it. The unlettered peasant knows in his heart the difference between hard work and production on the one hand, and predation and expropriation on the other. Unmolested then, there tends to grow up a society of agriculture and commerce where each man works at the task at which he is best suited in the conditions of the time, and then trades his product for the products of others. The peasant grows wheat and exchanges it for the salt of other producers or for the shoes of the local craftsman. If disputes arise over property or over contracts, the peasants and villagers take their problem to the wise men of the area, sometimes the elders of the tribe, to arbitrate their dispute.*

*There are numerous historical examples of the growth and development of such a purely free-market society. Two may be mentioned here. One is the fair at Champagne, that for hundreds of years in the Middle Ages was the major center of international trade in Europe. Seeing the importance of the fairs, the kings and barons left them unmolested, untaxed, and unregulated, and any disputes that arose at the fairs were settled in one of many competing, voluntary courts, maintained by church, nobles, and the merchants themselves. A more sweeping and lesser-known example is Celtic Ireland, which for a thousand years maintained a flourishing free-market society without a State. Ireland was finally conquered by the English State in the seventeenth century, but the statelessness of Ireland, the lack of a governmental channel to transmit and enforce the orders and dictates of the conquerors, delayed the conquest for centuries.""* - Murray Rothbard, Essay: Capitalism versus Statism, *Outside Looking In: Critiques of American Policies and Institutions, Left and Right*.

##The Need for Cyclical Consumption

The Employee performs tasks for the Employer in exchange for a “Wage” or monetary payment,
while the employer sells a good or service to the Consumer for a “Profit”- another classification of
monetary payment.

In turn, both the Employer and Employee function as Consumers, for the monetary payments
(“wages” and “profits”) they obtain are used to purchase goods and services relevant to their survival.
The act of purchasing goods and services, which is the role of the Consumer, is what allows the
Employer to make its “Profit”, while also enabling the payment of the Employee’s “Wage”.

In other words, it is the requirement of perpetual ‘Consumption’ that keeps the Employer in business
and maintains the Employee’s job.

Now, it is important to understand that this payment-consumption cycle (or ‘cyclical consumption’)
cannot stop, or the entire economic structure would collapse, for money would not come to the
Employer, the Employer would not be able to afford to pay his Employee, and both the Employer
and Employee would not be able to perpetuate the cycle by being a Consumer.

Consequence:
#1 - Nothing physically produced can ever maintain an operational lifespan longer than what can
be endured in order to maintain economic integrity through ‘cyclical consumption’.

#2- The introduction of new products and services must be constant to offset any increased
efficiency of the prior generations of production, regardless of functional utility, generating
endless waste.

***

##The Abundance of Scarcity

In Monetary Economics, the notion of “Supply and Demand” is a well-known construct, simply
denoting that ‘the more there is of something, the less it is worth in respect to itself’’. For example,
drinking water was historically a very abundant resource, which didn’t typically require payment for
its consumption in a commercial sense. However, as pollution of the water table and city water
systems have developed, filtered drinking water is now being commercially sold, often at a higher
price than oil per gallon. In other words, it is profitable for resources to be scarce. If a company can
convince the public that their product is “rare”, the more they can charge for that product. This
provides a strong motivation to keep their items scarce. On yet another level, it should be pointed out
that the central banks of nearly all countries also create scarcity within the money supply itself in
order to keep pressure on the market system. Bernard Lietaer, designer of the EU currency system
points out:

“Greed and Competition are not the result of immutable human temperament…greed and fear of scarcity are in fact
being continuously created and amplified as a direct result of the kind of money we are using…We can produce more
than enough food to feed everybody…but there is clearly not enough money to pay for it all. The scarcity is in our 
national currencies. In fact, the job of the central banks is to create and maintain that currency scarcity. The direct
consequence is that we have to fight with each other in order to survive.”

The ramifications of this abundance of scarcity are nothing but detrimental. If profit can be made as a
result of scarcity generated by environmental pollution, then this creates a sick reinforcement of
indifference to environmental concern. If companies know they can make more money by having
their resources or products remain scarce, how can a world of abundance ever occur? It can’t, for the
corporation will be motivated to create the scarcity if need be. In turn, the scarcity created in the
money supply itself by the central banks compounds the motivation for us to compete with each
other, generating an ethic-less, primitive tribalism with everyone out for themselves, producing
human stress, conflict and illness.

***

##The Priority of Profit

A monetary system’s foremost motivating principle is Profit, or the acquisition of money through
the exploitation of others. All players in the game must, in order to survive, seek out a strategy to
acquire income. A “wage” earner seeks out the best possible pay he can get for his services, while the
Employer (owner/producer) seeks to constantly reduce costs in order to maximize profit. This is the
dominant “mentality” in a Monetary System and those who are in positions of great wealth (material
“success”) are often the most ruthless. While many people who favor the profit system will talk
endlessly about their “ethical” standards in regard to their practices, history has shown that the
priority of profit is actually a sickness which is not only poisoning our personal/social well-being and
standards of living, but also the environment on which we rely for virtually everything we need as a
species.

However, before we begin with the negative consequences resulting from this ‘mentality’, let us
consider what many think to be the good side of this profit priority – “Incentive”.
As the theory goes, the need for profit provides a person/organization with motivation to work on
new ideas/products that would sell in the market place. In other words, the assumption is that if
people were not motivated by their need to survive through profit, little social progress would be
achieved.

..

Consequence:

The psychological/sociological ramifications resulting from the priority of profit are of grave
proportions when it comes to the conduct of human beings. In fact, an entire structure of imposed
control has been created in order to deal with the never-ending problems associated with the need for
survival by way of gain/profit/income - The Legal System. While non-monetary related crimes, often
born from ego, jealousy, emotional deprivation and other psychological issues are currently a
problem, the frequency of non-monetary related crimes are nothing in comparison to the crimes
committed that are motivated by the acquisition of money and property. In fact, if we define
“Crime” as ‘Corruption’ and define “Corruption” as “Moral Perversion; Dishonesty”, then an entirely
new perspective comes into play, for, if you look closely enough, you will see that nearly every act of
strategic monetary gain is corrupt by its very construct…it is just accepted as ‘normal’ by the
conditioned culture to whatever degree is deemed tolerable by consensus.

***

##The Distortion of Values

Our Beliefs and Values are shaped by culture. While there is a genetic basis to certain human
attributes and behaviors, the knowledge we have and the way we think about and act upon that
knowledge is fundamentally an environmental phenomenon.

With that in mind, the monetary system requires a form of communication to inform the public of
what a company has made available for sale. This form of communication is termed ‘advertising’.
The characteristic of advertising is ‘promotion’ and promotion is a manner of communication, which,
generally speaking, creates a bias in favor of the product in question. In other words, advertising’s job
is to entice…or in more direct terms – manipulate the consumer into purchasing a product. This
manipulation takes many forms, but one of the most effective is the manipulation and/or exploitation
of the viewing audience’s “values” - what he or she finds important.

However, before we go any further, it needs to be pointed out that the mass consumption patterns
currently seen in the United States and elsewhere were not always the case. America originally was
founded, to some degree, on a kind of Protestant work ethic, where thrift and savings were dominant
values. However, by the early 20th century, a concerted effort by the business community set out to
distort these notions and mold a new army of impulsive, perpetually dissatisfied, status conscious
consumers. Advertising agencies switched their arguments from utilitarian ones to those gauged for
emotional appeal and status. Consequently, today the average American consumes twice as much as
he or she did since the end of WWII.

Now, one of the most powerful forms of ‘value manipulation’ comes from re-associating a person’s
identity to a particular ideal. Patriotism and Religion are classical examples of this, for through
indoctrination at an early age, a person is often conditioned to feel a close personal connection to a
country or religion, hence conditioning that person to want to support the doctrines, unconditionally.

...

In the end, our values are based on what works and helps us create easier, better lives. If we live in a
system that rewards competition, unenlightened self-interest, corruption, vanity and arrogance, then
these are the values that will constantly be perpetuated in society. While many people give lip service
to ‘honesty, caring for others and humility’, it is easy to see why these qualities do not prevail, for the
system of survival in society today does not support or reinforce them.

Hola Gringos,

Have you headed back to your European cave yet?

Us Euros are supposedly invaders upon Chicano or whatever land. We are immigrants, I hear and read.

Well, lacking any time parameters I am aware of, ALL humans are invaders and/or immigrants.

So... EVERYBODY, back to Africa and pick a tree to dwell in.

A multitude of displaced critters will be enthused at the ability to roam free in a land not polluted by humans.

Concerning pollution, compare and contrast the amount of pollution, garbage, filth, etc. created and tossed about by the culture invading from the south to the culture that created the USA.

Rather obvious who the truly filthy one's are, is it not?

Then I read of Chicano gang bangers tagging rocks at Yosemite National Park.

That should merit hanging by the neck until dead in my humble gentle non-politically correct opinion.

I have arrived at a conclusion after decades among the invaders and years of research. Thanks to the Web a wealth of knowledge, opinions, research results, a veritable tidal wave of information is available and I took advantage of it.

I have concluded that the USA has been in the midst of class warfare for 30-plus years.

Warren Buffet, one of the richest Americans, agrees:

""There's class warfare, all right,"" Mr. Buffett said, ""but it's my class, the rich class, that's making war, and we're winning.""

A minute minority of illegals are ousted with minimal real effort to keep the invading horde of barbarians out of the USA.

Thus, the USA elite class wants those illegals and uses them as a weapon in class warfare.

Divide and conquer to defeat an enemy.

We, the People, are an enemy to our elite class.

The elites, much of corporate America and special-interest groups want ever-more wealth and power and, ultimately, to usurp what the Founders created and replace that with an oligarchy similar to Mexico's government.

Oligarchy: definition:  a form of government in which power effectively rests with a small elite segment of society distinguished by royal, wealth, intellectual, family, military or religious hegemony. Such states are often controlled by politically powerful families whose children are heavily conditioned and mentored to be heirs of the power of the oligarchy. Oligarchies have been tyrannical throughout history, being completely reliant on public servitude to exist. Oligarchy is not always a rule by wealth, as oligarchs can simply be a privileged group. Thank you Wikipedia.

To fight the invasion will require a fight against the enemy behind the enemy, our own elite class and its minions, lackeys, cohorts and the multitude of bureaucracies and bureaucrats created to preserve the elite's status quo and to distance the elite class from the rest of the USA.

I am convinced it is CLASS WAR and We, the People are losing.

Which is still a minority. I suppose those who want Turkey to enter the EU are either:

1. Businessmen seeking slave lab- I mean business opportunities.
2. Politically correct happy-wappy westerners who want Turkey just because it's a muslim country.
3. Deluded into thinking Turkey is Europe.

&gt; It seems to me that you're from a fairly major European country and just scared of the possibility that 80 million turks become a part of EU.

I'm scared of:

1. Letting non-European countries enter the European Union. It'd defeat the purpose of the EU.
2. Letting a country with massive human rights, social and cultural issues in like it's one of us. It'd sabotage the European standard and make us all hypocrites.

1254385995,2,AskReddit,,,2,t3_9prcg,t1_c0dv18k,True,0,True,arsicle,1426060998,False,"I was out walking in the mountains in Central Asia with a friend.  We were just standing around waiting for a bus to go back to town when a police officer pulled up a Niva (little 4x4 hatchback).  He asked me what I was doing and I told him we were waiting for a bus.  A little discussion ensued, he looked at our documents, didn't believe that my friend had a real passport (he didn't know that Belgium was a country and thought that Brussels is the capital of Europe).  

He told us to get in the car.  I asked where we were going and he said ""a little up.""  I would have called someone to help at this point, but I had no cell phone service cause of the location.  I asked him when the last bus left and he told me ""don't worry, you won't miss it.""  So we got in the car (it was a mistake in retrospect, but I didn't know what to do), and he went the opposite way of town, into the mountains.  

My friend didn't speak the local language at all, and he sat up front.  I sat in the back and used the pretense of translating to discuss what was happening/what we should expect.  This ended up being a helpful arrangement, as I got service for a minute (I wasn't too freaked out yet), and sent an SMS to a security guy affiliated with the US embassy.  I just said ""I'm in a police car, there's no trouble yet, but I want you to be aware.""  

The cop asked if i had been ""Up there,"" and pointed deeper into the mountains.  I didn't want to say yes or no to any questions...I didn't want to go ""up there,"" so I didn't want to say ""no"" and have him take me.  Equally, I didn't know if ""up there"" was actually the Russian border or some such, so I didn't want to say ""yes.""  I asked ""what's there"" and he said ""it's a rest area, I'll take you.""  So we went to this little tea house pretty deep in the mountains and he ordered some tea and we sat down to talk.

He asked me what I did (I was Peace Corps), so I told him I taught English (vast simplification, but teachers get more respect sometimes, and generally aren't assumed to have much money).  He asked how much money I make (common question there, even for strangers) and when I said ""$300 a month"" he refused to believe me.  He insisted that no Westerner in no situation would agree to make that little money.  In fact, he insisted, it was impossible to live on that much money.

I asked him when the last bus left and he told me ""not for a while, don't worry.""

We had to wait about 30 minutes for tea because they had to build a fire to hear the water, and he generally just dicked me around and made me feel uncomfortable.  At some point he said ""you think I want money from you?  See how much money I have:"" and pulled out a wad of what must have been well over $1000 from his pocket (keeping in mind his official monthly salary is probably about $400) that was clearly from recently collected bribes.  This didn't really allay my fears.

Of course, I also happen to have $500 in my backpack because my landlady was going to be working in my house that day, and I wanted to bring it with me (it was my emergency fund).  At some point as we're finally leaving the tea house after an hour he tells me ""I know you're moving money in your bag.""  Then I asked when the last bus leaves.  He told me ""oh, it left a long time ago.""

This was when I started to worry quite a bit.  I didn't even notice as we entered the little area with cell phone service again that I had gotten it back when I got a phone call from the security officer I had texted.  He asked where I was and I said I was still in the car, in the mountains.  He asked to talk to the cop, so I had him pull over and gave him the phone.

The cops face dropped almost instantly as the phone call started, very amusing.  Pretty quickly thereafter he was insisting that he hadn't stopped us but rather was escorting us back to the bus stop because we needed help.  He was clearly terrified of what was happening.  After the phone call he asked why he had called and I just said ""they called my house and I wasn't there so they asked where I was and I said 'in a police car.'""  

I was worried cause we were still in the middle of nowhere and he could turn on us, but he accepted this answer and drove us all the way back to the bus stop.  However, his whole demeanor had changed, he was clearly very afraid of offending me, after minutes earlier calling me a liar.  He went from being super cocky to being extremely deferential, etc.  

So he got us to the bus station in town, 3 minutes before the last bus for the night left, thanked us for the nice time we had in the mountains together, and that was it.

Very cool to humble and scare someone who was so clearly a terrible human being.

edit: obviously that's the long form, obviously i boil it down for groups.

tl;dr - stopped by the cops in the mountains of central asia without cell phone service in a country where the police are known to be extremely corrupt.  got in touch with someone affiliated with the US embassy after a couple hours.  scared the living piss out of him.",t5_2qh1i,,0,c0dv18k,0,t3_9prcg

Then they decided they were doing great and weren't that keen on EU integration after all and voted No. But now, with the credit crunch(*), recession and unemployment, isn't it funny how Ireland now seems to be about to decide that the EU is a good thing after all!

(*) As an aside, I found out recently from the [BBC Love of Money](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00mq36b) series, that on the day when Ireland decided to provide 100% backing to its banks, it only told the EU finance minister that morning and said nothing to any of the other countries...

- If a gypsy comes to your door wanting food, and you feed him, the next day there will be 10 at your doorstep.

The reason the poor in the USA are likely to stay poor, is that they are so poor. People who grow up with fewer resources are less likely to have the opportunity and ability to escape their economic situation. That is why economic mobility is higher in Europe.

What is being claimed with the [Ardipithecus](http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/human-evolution/human-ancestor) is the story of human ancestors coming out of the trees and evolving to walk upright is backasswards. The claim is the ancestor common to humans and chimps had already ""come down from the trees to walk up right,"" so to speak, and thus weren't more ""chimp-like"" tree dwellers as expected. Rather, there is a story of chimp ancestors walking up into the trees and adapting to life there. 

Interesting. Maybe the evolution of apes had more to do with moving on the ground than in the trees. Perhaps that explains the earlier ape fossils being found in Europe. It would be interesting to find those older apes having less splayed toes than Ardipithecus.

An interesting story, we can only stay tuned for the science.

&gt;
&gt; In September 2008 the Czech President stated that he would not sign the treaty until Ireland had ratified it. Prior to that he had stated that he was awaiting the verdict of the Constitutional Court concerning a complaint submitted by senators against certain parts of the treaty. The Court dismissed this complaint on 26 November 2008. However, the senators have since asked the Constitutional Court to assess the treaty as a whole. On 29 September 2009 a group of Czech senators lodged a fresh complain with the Constitution court. It is not known how long it will take the court to give its verdict. Anaylsts have stated the case could take up to six months to be resolved. In which case it could move close to the general election in the UK, which polls show the Conservatives are on course to win.

As a result, they have turned inward. Roma society is incredibly xenophobic and has very special rules for dealing with outsiders governing everything from business transactions to physical contact with outsiders (contact = big no no).

Considering the history of the peoples, I can understand this paranoia about outsiders. The Roma have been subjected to more attempts at ethnic cleansing throughout the centuries than any other currently existent group of people I can think of.

Roma have ""the code"" which says that it is acceptable to treat outsiders as less than equals. Jews and Muslims are two quick examples of societies with similar tenets. Somehow, though, modern society recognizes racism against the latter two groups as offensive, while against the former there is tacit acceptance.

While in high school, I had the great pleasure of interviewing Ian Hancock for an English paper.He is probably North America's most prolific authority on the Romani people.

Yes but the dollar is a relative value and directly impacts the amount of shit you can put in your house. Golds value is just as arbitrary in this case. It doesn't matter what you're saying the dollar is relative to. I just see people constantly point to it for no reason. The dollar being x value against gold does *not* matter in the least. What matters is how much shit you can buy with your dollar. Sure, you can either buy one gold ounce for 900 dollars or you can purchase a 50"" television that cost untold amounts in 1990. 

&gt; but the houses of the 1950's were actually UNUSUALLY SMALL.

In comparison to what exactly? They were larger than the majority of homes people lived in in europe which typically averaged 600~700 sq feet and especially to intercity homes in America, which were roughly the same size. Most historians would say that a 3 bedroom house was unusually large for the era... right until 900+ square feet became the norm. Now most families live in 1500+ square foot homes.

Technology has been continously doubling for a while now and there is no reason to see it stopping. I can guarantee you that once we adopt quantum computing there will be a paradigmn shift.

&gt; It was such a powerful force that the price cost of the computers themselves was actually on a DEFLATIONARY curve, even DESPITE the significant inflation of the 1970's, 80's and 90's.

Making goods cheaper over time is a normal process though? Everything becomes cheaper over time unless it is held up through artifical means; especially like gold which is subject to governments and individuals attempting to horde it for no reason other than it being a shiny metal.

&gt; In essence, the parasitic government ""sucked"" a significant part of that value out of the economy during those decades 

You haven't shown this though any sort of data though.

Agreed. That's why I think it is reasonable for the benefits to accrue largely to the mother after the child is born; she has more invested in it. 

&gt;the system desperately needs reform, but forced contraception isn't the way to do it.

It wouldn't be forced. If you took advantage of the program you get an ""Enhanced Benefits Package,"" if not then you get the ""Economy Package."" 

In principle it functions the same as your idea, except that in mine the government provides the contraception instead of relying on the kids to do it themselves. 

&gt;If they cannot meet those requirements and clearly cannot support the child within 5 months of birth, off to adoption they go

There are already too many kids in the system. If we get everyone on contraception until they are reasonably capable of taking care of a kid there would be less kids in the system, and the kids that *are* there would get taken care of better.

I agree with everything you're saying, but from a funding standpoint it is a lot cheaper for the government to prevent kids than to take care of them. And this would free up resources that can be used to *encourage* childbirth among segments of the population that are highly educated and highly productive, yet are not reproducing at replacement rate. 

The second part of this plan is perhaps the most important. Encouraging the *right* people to have kids is important. Our demographic profile still looks good -- compared to Western Europe and Japan -- but that's mostly because of immigration. We need to balance out the age cross-section so that we can support all these entitlement programs that are about to kick in.

The Treaty doesn't introduce any drastic changes and will in fact make the EU more efficient.
By pooling more of our sovereignty we can achieve a lot more.
For example, the EU is a borderless union operating a free market, so creating common laws for all 27 countries makes sense. Less red tape, less crap to deal with, and what you do in one country, you can perfectly expand to another.

Also, on crime fighting and the environment the Lisbon Treaty sets out provisions for closer cooperation.
27 countries working together to stop criminals operating in a free market makes sense.

Also, the clout and dedication to the environment of 27 countries implementing the one policy is far more effective than 27 conflicting ones.

Also, talk of federalism is such crap.
People consistently fail to see how the EU works. Member states call the shots and decide what laws to pass. 
When people say that the EU brought in some law, for example on agriculture, and is forcing it upon us, they fail to understand that the reason the law was passed was because their national minister for agriculture went to Brussels, met all his agricultural minister counterparts from all EU countries, voted on Ireland's behalf.

&gt;We don't have any records of women entering actual open revolt against their status, but I really wouldn't be surprised if some came to light. You can't keep people down forever.

I would be.  I'd be very surprised.  I still maintain that **most** women living in pre-lib societies were perfectly satisfied with it.  I mean, men didn't keep them chained to the floor for pure sex and cooking, there was more to life than that (OK, maybe unless you grew up in certain centuries in Japan and a few other places).  European women have had a level of freedom for millennia, just a toally different set of rules.  For the most part, they could talk to their husbands about their own ideas, and any decent husband listened and took their council, but in the end the man made the final decision.  Men were respected by their wives, and the wives were respected by their men.  In as free and equal society as we have now, there are still tons of women who - though educated, intelligent, and with great potential - choose to live such a life, submit ultimately to the will of their husbands.  And I respect them for their choice, because it is their choice.  I'm just glad women have a choice, instead of everyone being forced into a role that only a portion of them would choose to accept if they had all the facts.

&gt;Social roles are still largely defined by one's plumbing.

What is perceived is not always what is, and what is is not always what should be.

&gt;So again, I ask, why ""gender roles"" rather than ""social roles""? Why involve a person's sexuality, even at a separation of one degree, in the role they play in society?

I'm not involving sex *or* sexuality.  I'm not talking dicks and pussies here (male and female), I'm talking Man and Woman.  Gender.  Completely separate.

&gt;So, yes, I agree fully that gender roles are a concept with very little meat, and I think that's why we need to abandon them completely, and focus purely on non-sexually tied societal roles.

Again, this is non sex and non sexual/sexualitic.  This is Gender, and yes the meat is there but it is hard to get at.  But it's a worthy pursuit.

&gt; I don't think there is great representation on the No side. Actually, I think the media profile of the No campaign is fucking awful. I am continually accused of guilt by association when I declare my intention to vote No: 'how could you vote no when all the christian right, neo-con, blatant ignoramus party are campaigning for a No vote?'

&gt; It is quite disheartening.

&gt; I can forgive the media to some extent, since they will always find a simple story more newsworthy than a nuanced one. And unfortunately the arguments against the Lisbon Treaty are just that; nuanced. Arguments for the Yes side tend to be relatively simple: jobs, economics, cultural engagement with Europe. Arguments against are quite complicated: 'corporate interests will trump the rights of citizens, privatisation of social services will go ahead', 'the EU is not a very democratic institution, laws can't even be proposed by MEPs only amended' etc.

&gt; This is probably why the No campaign has made such amazingly stupid errors. The coir campaign of voting no because the minimum wage would be reduced to 1.85? Why name an amount?, the point is well made without an actual figure that you would then have to justify. They must have just pulled it out of the air, it is amateurish in the extreme and probably caused the No campaign quite a bit of damage.

But then, as if mocked by cruel fate, Declan (Fucking) Ganley arrives back on the scene and spends the rest of the campaign talking about whether he gets donations from US armaments manufacturers or london hedge funds.

&gt; It's almost like he is an agent provocateur, I mean what kind of ego must the man have to think that after his embarrasing failure to get elected (and then embarrasing toys-out-of-pram throwing after learning of this) that he would have had anything but a negative effect on the campaign.

&gt; To finish: an argument rarely made for voting no.

&gt; I am pro-european but I will vote no (more nuance). Why? Because this is fundamentally a bad deal for the people of Europe. We are taking a system built by accident as much as design, without a proper framework of checks and balances and turning it into a de facto federal power.

&gt; If I was asked honestly if I wanted a federal europe I would probably say yes (it is inevitable anyway, right?), but with a political system/framework capable of providing this in an equitable way to all its citizens. I suspect most people feel the same but they are making a huge leap of faith to think the Lisbon Treaty is it.

&gt; We need to establish a european political system that is right at the start. After all, it is very hard to change it once it is written into law (look at the voting system in England: think the Lib Dems would really change it to PR if they got in? I certainly doubt it). I happen to think the Irish system is one of the more equitable in the world. There are things I would change, but I think it is a reasonably good system. We are about to swap it for a system that can and will be manipulated by special interests to the detriment of the majority of its citizenry.

&gt; tl;dr: vote no :)

&gt;In comparison to what exactly? They were larger than the majority of homes people lived in in europe which typically averaged 600~700 sq feet and especially to intercity homes in America, which were roughly the same size. 

You are now switching and choosing to compare Apples to Oranges. Doesn't matter what the ""typical"" size of home was in Europe (and what exactly constitutes ""typical"" -- average? mean? what about the ""Manor Houses"" in England? Or are we to ignore those [despite the fact that many of the help lived there as well] and instead are we to use the size of the ""worker's shed"" in the village?)

&gt;Most historians would say that a 3 bedroom house was unusually large for the era... right until 900+ square feet became the norm. Now most families live in 1500+ square foot homes.

Well, then most ""historians"" would be wrong.  Typical farm homes featured distinct kitchens, several bedrooms, a dining room, sitting room, music room, etc -- and these were quite common, not merely the ""wealthy"" (who in fact had much larger ""mansions""). 

And as I stated, yes, many immigrants lived in small ""workers housing"" that was built/owned by the local factory, etc.  But equating those to a normal ""house"" erected by a person on his own is no more relevant than it would be to compare it to the square footage of a college student's dorm room.

&gt;&gt; but we'll never again see the exponential gains that we did by the initial adoption of computers.

&gt;This is likely a false statement. ""We will never again see the exponential gains that we did by the adoption of the wheel! the printing press! The steam engine! The internal-combustion engine!, etc""

So sorry that I wasn't pedantic enough for you. What I meant (by context which you didn't comprehend) was that:

*""The exponential gains from adoption of computers will NOT happen again by the adoption of additional, faster computers. IOW, the 'economic gains' from computerization are now essentially complete (in the same way that the gains from the advent of steam power are long past, and the gains from IC engines completely integrated into the economy -- gains from further refinements in steam or IC engines are unlikely to me more than minor in influence, and likewise with further advances in computer hardware.""*

Is that explanatory enough for you? 

&gt;Technology has been continously doubling for a while now and there is no reason to see it stopping. 

And where (other than Moore's law with circuitry) do you see this phenomenal ""doubling"" going on?  My turn to demand evidence.

&gt;I can guarantee you that once we adopt quantum computing there will be a paradigmn shift.

How?  Because accounting transactions will be able to be done 100x faster?  Modern computing already happens so fast that for 99% of applications, processor chips are actually sitting ""idle"" and waiting for input the vast majority of the time. Increasing the speed of the processor itself (much like increasing the storage capacity of hard drives) will no longer gain us much of anything for a further advantage.

&gt;&gt;And my argument wasn't that Moore's law that technology should thank economic process, it was that technology is part of the economic process and cannot be excluded.

And I have sufficiently demonstrated that I not only understand it, but have a much more thorough understanding of it than you do... you simply seem to believe in a Pollyanna fashion that ""technology will save us""?

I have no doubt that we will in general continue to innovate technology wise, but we most certainly cannot predict nor ""count on"" any more ""exponential"" innovations to save our bacon. (Many of the most important innovations DID indeed come ""out of left field"" -- in that they were not ""centrally planned"" and in a few cases, entirely unexpected.)  And it will be good that such does continue -- but I would expect most such things to have incremental, evolutionary value, rather than exponential, revolutionary value; indeed I think that the ACTUAL productivity increase from computerization is LESS than commonly believed, if only because it has also become a great time-waster, and a tool for ""busywork"".

&gt;Making goods cheaper over time is a normal process though? Everything becomes cheaper over time unless it is held up through artifical means; especially like gold which is subject to governments and individuals attempting to horde it for no reason other than it being a shiny metal.

Yes and no.  It is commonly TRUE that manufacturers (and farmers) HAVE been continually increasing their productivity and efficiency -- but it is NOT something that happens ""automatically"" -- it requires significant thought, creativity, effort, and investment, in short it is a LOT of work.

And there are many things (from natural disasters, to epidemic diseases, to wars, to tyranny) that can deflate, disrupt or even ""reverse"" those innovations.

&gt;You haven't shown this though any sort of data though.

There are plenty of collections of data that DO show this though. ([Reinhart &amp; Rogoff](http://www.amazon.com/This-Time-Different-Centuries-Financial/dp/0691142165) have recently [assembled 800 years worth of data](http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2009/09/800-years-financial-folly) -- which is doubtless too large to fit into a reddit post, and took them years to assemble.) As far as your demand, I assert you should go and assemble the data to back up your position, assemble it and present it here in full, and THEN I'll consider doing the same on my side. (IOW your ""demand"" for data is absurd).



&gt;&gt;You see, since the major economic impact of Moore is now over

&gt;This isn't true in any sense. Computing power is still doubling, as is nearly all other forms of technology.
&gt;
&gt;You're like a modern day John Adams at this point. ""Men will likely never take the sky! We have reached our limits!""

It's completely true. You've provided zero evidence of this imaginary ""doubling"" of ""nearly all other forms of technology"" -- such an expansion of capability exists only in your mind. 

And the MAJOR gains from computing are now fully integrated. There is no ""magic bullet"" from computer chips that is going to ""save us all"" -- just not there... sorry (and I'm not a technophobe, but rather I am and always have been a technophile, just not a self-delusional one.)",t5_2qh1s,,0,c0dvpxy,0,t3_9puac

It is well known ""fact"" that Russia is cutting gas supplies to Ukraine for political reasons and creating horrible problems for downstream consumers, it is less often mentioned that supplies are cut only when they are not paid for. In other words -- if Ukraine pays for gas, no matter what policy is, the gas is supplied and everyone is happy. When Ukraine is not paying for gas (prices that are much lower then average European prices) sometimes supplies are cut by amount reserved for Ukraine in which case Ukraine is just tapping gas intended for paying customers. I agree that Western paying customers do not really care why the supplies are cut as they are freezing anyway, but the picture is slightly different then ""Russia is randomly cutting supplies for political reasons"".

In fact the only case of politically motivated energy deal gone sour in recent years (as far as I remember -- I do not follow energy markets closely) was when after 08/08/08 Australia decided not to supply its uranium to Russia for enrichment.

I think the Asian man has been emasculated in American culture and the stereotypes of being meek, under endowed, nerdy, etc. persist.

These are just stereotypes though, and I have seen some changes in them over the years (I'm 36).  There have been a couple of actors and other pop culture icons that have increased the visibility and upped the stock of Asian men in America.

I'm married to a Caucasian woman.  I have been in relationships with men and women from most races.  Things seem different in Europe.  I got laid (hetero) without trying at all in Spain and Germany.

Any European ladies want to comment on that phenomenon?   To sum up what I have heard so far, Asian men are considered more exotic there.

Actually there is plenty of reason why this wouldn't be true. First off, we have no real idea of how many or which genes affect differential intelligence, nor how they interact or correspond to physiology. 

Second, even if we knew which genes these were, the likelihood of them assorting along the lines of the traditional ""races"" are pretty much nil. For example, even if we found out that ""Genes XYZ lead to high intelligence,"" you would find people with these genes in every population on Earth. And what we commonly recognize as ""races"" actually consist of many genetically-distinct populations. How many ""races"" are there in Africa? One (""black"")? 500 (every ethnic/linguistic/tribal group)? How about in Europe? India? Asia? 

Third, even if we could somehow narrow down the hypothetical super-smart populations within each population, you would find such a group within every ""race"". So if you look at a ""black"" person, do you know whether he's from that group or not, based on his ""blackness""? The metric of ""race"" wouldn't give you any useful information to make an educated guess. So you can't say meaningfully that different ""races"" have different levels of intelligence.

For the most part the Yes campaign - in particular the Mainstream political parties and 'civil groups' such as 'We Belong', 'Ireland for Europe' and 'generation yes' (all with connections to mainstream political parties or in the case of generation yes the Irish Business and Employers confederation) have funneled millions of Euros (even Intel have gotten in on the act) into cynically manipulating public opinion on the treaty by representing it as critical to Ireland's economic recovery - e.g. 'For Jobs, Vote Yes', 'For Recovery, vote yes' and 'Recovery or Ruin, vote yes'.

My mom couldn't even tell the difference between Windows 7 and Windows XP who says they will care if it looks like Vista.  I don't know what the author wants Windows 7 to look like, I think the interface is beautiful.

**2.It will cost too much**
It's $30 for college students and back in august it cost $50 to upgrade for everyone else.  The prices for upgrade copies are a little high, however Microsoft can't really decrease the price much more considering it's already 30% cheaper than Vista.  

**3. XP is still too popular**
This point doesn't really make too much sense.  His point is that 71% of business machines are still running XP and that when Vista was released the estimate of business migrations were way off.  However, there is one big discrepency between Vista and Windows 7.  Vista is viewed as an incompetent OS while Windows 7 is viewed as an OS that rights most of the wrongs of Vista.  Here is a quote from an infopackets article *""To date, 24 per cent of companies asked by Goldman Sachs said they would make the upgrade to Windows 7 within 18 months, while another 67 per cent said they'd make the jump eventually. That's a higher rate than Vista achieved, says Bloomberg.""*

**4. The editions are too confusing**
There will be only two versions on the shelves in stores,  Windows Home Premium and Windows Professional.  The author describes Premium for people who want to do next to nothing when in reality, what it's for is people who don't need businesslike functions.  I used Home Premium Vista and I've never ran into a moment where I wish I had a better version.  If you buy the wrong version just use the in-place upgrade, how simpler could it get?  He also argues that Ultimate is the only version that Microsoft should be selling when most people don't want the extra space for all of the Ultimate features.  Unlike Apple, Microsoft makes most of their money off of Software, they can't subsidize the price of Windows with one of their Hardware units, their solution is to simply sell the versions at different prices directed at different markets.  They can have it cheaper for those who don't need it for anything more than e-mailing and browsing the web and more expensive for users that want to do bitlocker encryption and more advanced functions.
There are only two versions offered to the public, Professional and Home, just like XP.  Ultimate will only be sold online and Starter will only be sold to netbooks.

**5.  No upgrades  are available for XP(and europe)**

This point is complete and utter crap.  He says that XP users have to buy a full version of Windows 7 in order to upgrade from XP.  You can upgrade from Windows 7 to XP with an upgrade copy however you will have to backup your data and do a clean install beforehand.  He also says that Windows 7 will have a separate EU edition without IE8.  That plan was destroyed months ago, EU users can upgrade with Windows 7 upgrade and they are getting the same version the US is getting.

**6. It's no good for netbooks**
Starter is fine for what a netbook is purposed for, to check e-mail and browse the web, not to watch or listen to media.  For those who want to get more features can simply upgrade to Home Premium for $70.

**7.  Single sign-on apps will fail**
This is the only valid point the author may have, I don't know too much about this matter so I'm just going to assume he is right about this.

**8.  There are better alternatives**
For business use, Windows is the best way to go.  The author makes a huge point on how Windows 7 will break compatibility however, switching to OS X or Linux would break just about ALL compatibility.  This point is really just showing where his allegiance lies.

**9. XP Mode may not help you**
This is pretty valid point, most businesses don't have Virtualization software to switch over however XP mode is mainly for a scenario where a company is buying new computers and they want to have a way to run legacy apps temporarily while they start to port those applications to Windows 7 compatible mode.

**10.  You'll have to contend with DRM**
I keep hearing about how Windows Vista and 7 are embedded with DRM.  If it is, it's one of the least intrusive kinds of DRMs I know of.  I haven't had to deal with it at all.  The general rule of thumb is that Intrusive DRM like the spore debacle = bad and uninstrusive DRM like pretty much every other game is good.

This will teach REAL WORLD experience which is a thousand times more usefull than classes in getting a job.  say, during 8th grade they work in groups at a company in a low job, like janiter, cleaning buildings all day long and then getting actual money at the end of two weeks.  They will get judged by the employers and graded on the work they do.  The better the grade, the better the money.  This will show work/reward.  Then in 9th they might work on a garage, then 10th and 11th they will work in smaller groups or individualy at companies, labs,lawyers etc.  then durign 12th they can work at government buildings, as secretaries or gophers,  etc.  As they move up in grade, the pay would get better to reflect the better jobs.

blacks are genetically inferior to most other races, just look at Africa and the general state of misery the people there are in, while whites in Europe and North America live happy, healthy lives.  You can also come to the realization that the blacks in Africa never came up with a written language or progressed beyond hunter/gatherer lives until Europeans made their way into Africa.  Also, look at blacks in North America and their standard of living and level of education compared to that of whites in North America.

Women essentially have the mentality of children, and should therefore be treated as such.  Women are terrible in positions of power or leadership because of their childish and petty nature.  The women that do well in such positions have more of a ""masculine nature"" and are therefore more like men than women.  The most productive thing a woman could possibly do is bear and raise children and keep the household in order and let their men take care of the affairs of the outside world. 

I hate Latin American culture, especially when it makes its way into the United States.  I think that Mexicans and other Latin Americas are basically worthless, with a few exceptions.  The ones that aren't picking fruit or working as janitors are selling drugs, stealing from others, and prolifically producing more children to perpetuate their lifestyle.  

Religion is for idiots, and most religious people I meet are idiots.  The worst religious idiot are the ones that try to convert you over to their religion.  Same goes for atheists, even though they aren't religious, they're still a bunch of whiny overzealous sheep that want nothing more than to see their beliefs propagated throughout the galaxy.

French people suck, France sucks and most of it's larger cities smell like piss, which is odd considering that their sense of taste is refined enough to enjoy good food and wine.

Asians don't have souls, but other than that, I don't really have a problem with Asians, they're usually quiet, non-violent and keep to themselves.  If I had to pick just two cultures/races to exist on the earth, it would be Asians and white Europeans.  

People who identify with ""democrats"" or other such ""liberals"" are complete idiots who don't understand economics in the least bit.  People who identify with ""republicans"" or other such ""conservatives"" are complete idiots who don't understand economics in the least bit.

Hitler was one of the greatest leaders ever to live, even though he was an evil fuck, he did incredibly great things from very humble beginnings.  He took a country that was in a severe depression, turned it into an economic powerhouse and conquered half of Europe within a short amount of time.  He also built the autobahn.   (Please don't think that I'm a Nazi, I am not a Nazi, and I don't condone genocide)

Also, all the ""politically correct"" bullshit is part of a socialist/communist agenda that's conspiring to change the US through social, rather than political change from a free and open society to a communist society, much like 1984.  That's why I really support this thread, the whole idea of PC is bullshit and it's part of the reason why our great nation is eroding away.

I find that it is as much or even more of a problem in rich countries exactly for the reason stated: rich countries have too many over-consumers. Their population must be contained as certainly as the population of poor countries. From a global perspective, the USA is the most overpopulated country in the world considering its per capita consumption. It should aim to retain its currently low birth rate but curtail immigration to stabilize its population and preferably reduce it. Likewise for Canada, Australia and most of Europe.

The reason is that in Israel your approach to relations with the Arabs places you on a left-right scale from far-far-left = anti-Zionist pro-Arab to moderate left = dovish, pro-Arab Zionists to moderate right = security-state Zionists who want peace to far-far right = anti-Arab Greater Israel movement.

I also must say that adopting a language without adopting a culture or assimilating into another culture is impossible.

The problem with making statements like this is that it's not clear what is meant by 'citizens' and 'trump'.
The good of European citizens in general have their rights protected by a European Parliament. Power isn't being withdrawn from individual countries because of the Council of Ministers.
BUT
How do citizens of Ireland affect the policies which apply to them?   They can't.  Their voice is diluted by the citizens of other countries.   The EU spends most of its budget on agriculture to the advantage of some and the detriment of others.

In our system the premise is that we the people elect people that we truest to do the best for us and the country.

The idea more or less is that if those people who are the best and the brightest, who we truest, can't make good decision then nobody else could have done any better.

I also question the idea that people can make any rational decisions regarding complex matters like the Lisbon Treaty. For an educated people let alone to ordinary people, matters of the state, economy, internal and foreign affairs at their own are very complex and hard to understand let alone what their combined effects are.

could I get a link for this too, that's two I owe you. I know they are actively engaged in a pipeline, just as Russia is, and the trans Afgan/Palestine pipeline explains why Germany is involved in Afghanistan, well most of Europe wants that one.. China has also made a deal w/Iran, multi-billion, fifty year(?) and in Yuan, not dollars. They have or are still dealing for a major contract for Iraqi oil. Venezuela has signed a deal for billions of barrels to China, also in the yuan. And several deals in Africa. almost forgot, their huge investment in [Pakistan's](http://www.freemoneymaker.org/news/2009/07/28/pakistan-%E2%80%93-china-relationship-and-infrastructure-development/) coast.  It seems that at the least the US is standing out of the way, or possibly making China's investments safer. securing Pakistan for the pipelines and tanker depots, making Iraq available. helping to keep Iran from gaining strength through sanctions, Israel and internal strife. also allowing Venezuela to gather power, fiscally through less dependence on the US and its dollar, and by arms, fighters, missiles, bombers and submarines, mostly from Russia.(and didn't Israel take delivery of two new subs from Germany? who bought those?) 


 At the cost of how much, who are the beneficiaries? There are how many military bases throughout the world(and now seven more in Columbia)and how does the American populace benefit from this effort?

&gt;we've pulled back our Missile defense ambitions 

now don't forget, those missiles were to defend against missile attack from *Iran*. that's the official story and I'm gonna stick by it...

all this to make the point that it appears to me that America is going out of the way to pave the road for China. any attack on Iran(and it ain't gonna happen, this is all brinkmanship)will not damage China's long term goals. Just like America, China benefits from a disorganized internally conflicted middle east.

But out of all of this, will America see much of the oil? at low prices? Iraq was supposed to have paid for itself by now, I wonder if it ever will?  China gets good deals and spends no treasure in men or tribute to get them. they just keep funding America's debt.

The easiest way to ""fix"" social security now, assuming we even want to keep it, and that's one hell of an assumption, is to ""reset"" it to what it was when it was created.

America's military has always been a tool for financial purposes, a trite example is in Latin America's banana republics. French rubber plantations led them into Vietnam. Oil, rare metals middle east and africa, is it too hard to conceive of Blackwater hiring out to bodyguard Chinese in Iraq, because they did. even after the Iraqis banished Blackwater they continue their services as Xe.

maybe it is too simplistic to say the military is hired out to pay debts, but the army's pay comes from the governments treasury. and the money for that comes from selling treasury notes and the money for that comes from   sovereign funds in China and the UAE primarily with a lot more coming from the EU. if the military engages in actions counter to their wishes don't you think they would quit funding it?  (personal taxes aren't even sufficient to service the interest on the national debt, 45% of corporations[or is it even more, 75%?] pay no taxes at all)

No, I'm saying that the main goal of the EU - no more war in Europe, free trade, stability - has been achieved. An expansion of power of the EU would go above that initial goal.

Proponents of the expansion of the EU's power argue that it would be an expansion of democracy. That the EU government is democratically elected and more uniform laws would help the economy and such.

BUT, if you increase the number of people inside of a democratic system, certain problems arise.

* The number of people overruled by the majority rises. If the minority is a group with it's own identity, stability *decreases*. (Take the Basques in Spain, Kurds in Turkey, all living in what is considered a democratic system)

* More physical and emotional distance between members of parliament and voters. More layers of indirection. People who vote for people who vote for people who vote on laws. Buerocracy, lobbyism etc. get worse.

Ardi and Lucy, being individuals, don't evolve. Populations evolve. 

Also, to be strict, we don't know that the populations they were members of were directly ancestral to modern humans - there are many hominins that we have found, many more that we have not. 

It's a big bushy family tree, and any one fossil is more likley to be of a close cousin to a direct ancestor than an actual direct ancestor. 

Ardi (and to some extent Lucy) is probably very similar to a human ancestor, more like a great-great aunt rather than a great-grandmother. Lucy, being closer to us, has a better chance of being from a population from which arose actual human ancestors, but we still don't know for certain -- as I said, a very bushy family tree.

Modern Africans, Europeans and Asians share a common ancestor which was also African, but after the diaspora there would have been regular travel and interbreeding of human populations (were all still one species, for example, and we will remain so as long as we can continue to intercommunicate). To suggest that one or another might be more or less evolved is a nonsense - we're all adapted to our environments.

We don't even know for sure that our early human ancestors were black-skinned (though they very likely were).

Modern humans evolved together from a common ancestor, not one from another.

Women for the most part do not love us. They do not choose a man because they love him, but because it pleases them to be loved by him.

Women have no sympathy . . . And my experience of women is almost as large as Europe. And it is so intimate too. Women crave for being loved, not for loving. They scream at you for sympathy all day long, they are incapable of giving any in return for they cannot remember your affairs long enough to do so. 

A woman rarely discards one lover until she is sure of another.

Woman's dearest delight is to wound man's self-conceit, though man's dearest delight is to gratify hers. There is at least one creature lower than man.

Even a fickle woman is loyal to one man - until she prefers another.

Females are dangerous.

For example, it was the [Virginia Company](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Company), incorporated in London in 1606, that first had a commercial venture and established the Jamestown Settlement and then later Virginia State as one of the Estates of the Crown Corporation under the Holy Roman Empire.  They employed their own corporate army and had their own corporate law, codes, rules and policies that applied to its members.  Its members were only granted titles, civil liberties and privileges thereunder at times.

The 13 main state were established and run for the benefit of the corporations, and by the mid 18th century, as the East India Company had dominated trade across the Atlantic, it could charge as it wished to move material from the other corporations back to Europe. In this way, the East India Company in the 1760s profited, bought up shares in the 13 colonies / estates, and first proposed merging them into a single United States under its corporate control (note [corporate flag from 1707 to 1801](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flag_of_the_British_East_India_Company_%281707%29.svg)).

They often simply don't have the time, means, or incentive to learn the language. They need to settle down quickly, so they find Hispanics who can help them. They need to make money, and end up in jobs where everyone is Hispanic. Their social circles remain Hispanic, and generally everything they need to function daily is held in Spanish. Their kids will learn English so they can clear up any confusion anyway.

Add the fact that, really, English isn't the official language of this country, and several places in Miami are quite economically developed and would be a hindrance to live in if you DIDN'T know Spanish, and much of the incentive is gone. My parents learned the language over the years through their line of work, but it took long and they're far from perfect. My two grandparents in this country are simply too old: who could expect them to?

However, I don't like how much of Miami is so devoid of any trace of English that I know people who moved there from Cuba around age 8 or 9 and have abysmal English. English should absolutely be the sole language of instruction in school: it's clearly a huge asset in this country and the world.

Israel also fears a strong Iran as they would rival Israel as the regional military power. 
The Saudis fear a strong Iran for Iran is Shiia, Saudi is Sunni, and by a strange twist of fate the Shiite sit ontop of the saudi oil fields. ""Find Shiia, find oil"" as the saying goes. Iran could take the Saudi oil fields with a dozen sound trucks and 20 Imans.

The differences:

* Education! Going to college/university over here is almost free. It think it cost me €500/year. And you/your parents don't have a lot of money it's completely free. Having a masters/bachelors degree gives you A LOT of options in the job market. 
If i was born in the US, i wouldn't have never gotten my degree and i would have stuck working in a sucky low-wage job.
I honestly think that our 'universal education' is just as important as our universal healthcare.

* I'm pretty sure our 'workers' earn a lot more over here. The minimum wage is a lot higher for starters. So 'scraping by' over here is usually a problem of spending too much in stead of earning too little.
That doesn't mean everyone has heaps of money ofcourse, but people having to work several jobs to get by simply doesn't happen over here.

* Healthcare. This saves us all a lot money, so it also helps the 'scraping by' part. And without it, my parents would have been bankrupt a long time ago.

To be fair, the downsides:

* Taxes! There a LOT higher over here. About 40% of my paycheck goes straight to taxes. That's a lot of money and pretty frustrating at times. But considering my wage would have easily been 20-30% lower without my (government sponsored) degree, i can live with that. :)
And it also pays for our healthcare, roads, etc. Fair trade imo.

* The rich aren't as rich over here. If you want the 'american dream' of becoming a billionaire, you're in the wrong place over here. The rich get taxed more and corporations aren't (usually) left to run wild.

The intention being that the buyer would take the book to his or her local bindery to have the book bound to match the rest of his or her personal library. Even bound in these temporary paper covers the books would hold together for a long time, because they were sewn in the traditional fashion.

It may also have been this way in the rest of Europe, and even the rest of the world at one time, but it was a new thing to me when I moved from the US to France in the early Eighties. I later worked for a couple of years in my university library's conservation lab and bindery, and was able to master case binding, as well as tinker with old-fashioned hand bookbinding.

It seems to be a rare thing for publishers today to produce signature-sewn bindings. That used to be one of the selling points of Dover Publishers. Even though they specialized in public domain works sold in cardstock covers, the text blocks were sewn in signatures and would hold up to repeated readings, lasting for years. They could also be rebound into hard covers. Dover even sold manuals on hand binding and rebinding books, so you could learn to do it yourself.

Edited to add:

It looks like the submitter's book actually WAS sewn in signatures, the printer/binder just did a horribly shitty job of collating and consolidating the text block, as well as fixing it into the case binding. I would have got my ass chewed for doing a job like that, but the shop where I worked was concerned with long-lasting quality and not turning a fast buck.

It was sometimes had with breakfast, as attested in Benjamin Franklin's autobiography. In these times public sanitation, cholera and other water-transmitted diseases were a significant cause of death. Because alcohol is toxic to most water-borne pathogens, and because the process of brewing any beer from malt involves boiling the water, which also kills germs, drinking small beer instead of water was one way to escape infection. Small beer was also produced in households for consumption by children and servants. It was not unknown for workers in heavy industries and physical work to consume double figure (pint) quantities of small beer during a working day to maintain their hydration levels.

The original ""no"" votes in France, Holland and Ireland should have been a trigger for the authors to remove the federalist elements before resubmitting it to a Europe wide referendum.

Someone may want to pass the property on in kind for work. This prevents a free market arrangement. One may not have the money to buy but can pledge his/her sweat equity. This can go on for generations. Preventing the state from collecting revenue and yielding unsteady tax base.**

But the argument would go, if I've understood you correctly, that nobody owns a property only exclusive rights for themselves from the state.  So it wouldn't be transferrable - it wouldn't be yours to give.  You have the right recognised, you don't have the right to sell what you don't own the land itself.  Of course people will always try to find loopholes or to manipulate the system to their own ends but all property would have to go through a land registry.  If you don't appear on it because you only live there because you conducted a private exchange - you don't have a right to exclusivity.  People just wouldn't do it just as when they currently exchange houses they make sure to exchange both deeds at the same time, typically through a 3rd party solicitor or registrar.  Only when both deeds are in their possession are they handed to the relevant parties.  Likewise nobody will legally be able to privately exchange recognised exclusivity rights because they don't own the land and the party that recognises the right isn't included.  In such an exchange they'd be giving away something for nothing.

&gt;**Many times people work their whole life to leave their real property to their heirs? This makes property ownership and care for property less attractive and makes older people less likely to upkeep their property.**

Well people will still want to care for their property if only for themselves but remember they'd still have a right to their labour - even after death in a will.  They'd also have the extra assets to bequeath derived from having never paid an income tax.  They might even arrange for their assets to go into paying for their heirs to have exclusivity to that property if they so wish.

&gt;**Additionally, even homestead land has value, it is just often a race to homestead. At this point you could value the land but really markets are still in a primitive phase during homesteading.**

Absolutely but then I'm all for that.  Get a bargain if you can!  I want developers, homesteaders, entrepreneurs and small businesses paying as little and increasing production on land.  Good luck to them and if the state coffers miss a trick so be it.  They'll still make money in the end but that brings us to your next point which I believe is a good one...and one were I break away from most geolibs.

&gt;**I may not know that I have a gold vein running through my property. Should I be forced to exploit it when I find out? How should such land be valued. Land in any case with unexpected wealth.**

Well if you have life exclusivity rights to the land do what you wish!  However I would argue you have a right to the fruit of your labour...but you didn't make the gold.  Found it, dug it, smelted it, refined it and sold it maybe but the actual un-renewable resource was just as much the state's and all the people she represents.  And in this sense I'm with Norway where national resources are the possession of everybody - not just everybody today, but everybody tomorrow and so the exploitation of resources must be put to use for them too.  At the moment Alaska redistributes oil revenue to its people today: Norway has allowed private enterprise to drill for oil, to make profit but it has taxed that profit and put it into a petroleum fund to invest in Norway's future.  It is now Europe's biggest stock holder at 2.4trillion krone, and exclusively owned by the Norwegian people.  I  know I've moved beyond the scope of the article to play devil's advocate on behalf of the geolibs.

I break away with Geolibertarians when many of them describe Georgism as a single tax.  I don't want to see you priced out of your home because you find gold....nor do I want to see the next generation exploited out of their claim to their nation's resources by this generation's greed.  I don't recognise corporate personhood either so I have a bit of a get out in that I don't have to tax individuals.  For the individual it is still a single tax.  I'm all for business tax but I'd like to see it based on a Pigovian basis.  I see no point in taking 20% from a small business which impedes on no-one and contributes to the society.  I also see no point in taking from a big business which puts back into the community more than what it takes out.  Realistically they might place an extra demand on infrastructure which rates may have to accommodate but what I'm saying is I'm not interested in excessive taxing for the sake of it.  However if there is a big corporate business that does infringe on individuals, breaks down community, places excessive demands on infrastructure without compensation, pollutes the air or water table then I'm only interested in taxing to the amount it takes to put right.  Run a small business well - leave them alone.  Run a big business well - leave them alone, reward even by reducing business tax.  But address the authoritarian aspect of big business not by regulation but simply by rewarding altruistic behaviour with lower rates/profit...and of course all employees, even if a sole employee of your own company, would still not have to face an income tax as individuals.

&gt;**Although Rothbard claiimed that there is an excess of land there is no denying that land can and has appreciated without bubble as population grows. So, I take georgist would have no problem taxing these capital gains.**

The land exclusivity right is yours, not the land itself.  You have no capital gains to tax....so no.

 If you agree an extended rental rate for a 36 month period however and in that time surrounding land goes up then 'yes', you may have to pay more in 36 months time when you come to renegotiate if there are others willing to pay the extra but that's not a capital gains tax...just competition in the market.

&gt;**I think it maybe fairly free market and I thank you for your explanation but when the author expresses ""as adamant about free market capitalism as it is possible to be"", I believe his case is overstated.**

You're right it is.  Reductio ad absurdum: it could be a lot more free market by abolishing government altogether beyond a positive and negative right constitution!  It might turn a bit Lord of the Flies (it might not!) but a freer market is perceivable.

This doesn't matter unless you're trying to identify *individuals* with high intelligence.

&gt; Second, even if we knew which genes these were, the likelihood of them assorting along the lines of the traditional ""races"" are pretty much nil.

If intelligence was more strongly selected for in a given population, you would expect that population to become more intelligent, just as when light skin is selected for (as in parts of sunlight-deprived Europe), you would expect that population to become light-skinned.

It doesn't need to be X, Y, Z genes that only black people have or A, B, C genes that only Asians have, either. It has to do with the *frequency* of genes that affect intelligence.

&gt; How many ""races"" are there in Africa?

Depends how you split it up, but Africans are more genetically related to each other on average than they are to Asians, or just about any other group you care to define.

You can't. This, again, doesn't matter.

Of course, humans will simply create new words by borrowing them from other languages, through composition or through other mechanism, but obviously machine translation can't do that. But that was not really the point of this discussion ;)

Yes, but you could sell and transfer a life interest (or you would be precluded and this would result in a limiting of freedom to contract Ed.) to a younger partner and keep this going indefinitely there are law firms in which all the named partners have been dead for hundreds of years.  Again, this provides a very unsteady and unfair method of taxation for the state.  It tends to freeze the very markets it wants to tax from or has a chilling effect on secondary markets such as a law firm or sweat equity example which might be greater than the real estate market in the long run (ed.).  People would be forced to postpone many sales as much as possible.    This even tends to take away the right to death.  People who might otherwise die would be artificially fed for years just so their relatives dont have to move. It doesnt sound very free.

I dont think seniors are going to be making much of an investment in improving real estate under these circumstances.   It is a disincentive.  I dont know if you have ever been to probate court but I can only imagine how messy it would get trying to separate improvement from natural appreciation.    Also, maintenance and such would not be improvement so let the place fall apart for the last ten years of my life and put the money in something else or gift it.   You actually save tax by not maintaining if you are older as you dont get full measure of your maintenance and neither do your heirs. Ed. Changed ""improvement"" to ""maintenance"" makes a stronger case I think.

I appreciate you engaging in this exchange.  Norway and Alaska (Norway especially with its crazy oil reserves if I recall) are really special cases but my point from the Georgist point of view would be what if I had alot of oil under my land.  The land is exclusively mine and I dont wish to exploit it.  I could even waste it.

Interesting to read your perspective. I am a Right libertarian.  I also dont believe in corporate personhood. Ed.

Yes but this is really a capital gains tax by any other name.  If there is no appreciation in property people wouldnt be willing to pay more and there would be no capital gains tax.  It basically locks people into life estates and doesnt seem very free.  Basically, a capital gains tax covered by a fig leaf.   Plus, it puts people in difficult positions of guessing their life span.  Should I get a place for 60 years and hope I am dead and save a bit or should I go for a tenancy for life.

Thanks for a great chat and putting up with my ramble.  Feel free to correct me again if I misunderstood anything.  My basic understanding of georgism was always everyone owns everything found in nature.   I always thought this idea flawed because what you find in nature isnt what brings value so much as the ingenuity of those who can convert to a valuable product for the masses.  Oil was basically worthless a few hundred years ago.  Uranium was more toxic than valuable.  What gives these resources value is human innovation not the earth intrinsically.

I understand what you are saying, and at a certain extent I agree with your points of view. I can see how social conditions can lead to such behaviors (and I am sure they do more than often), BUT... there is this Big BUT. 

Most of the ones that I frown upon are certainly not poor. They might look poor, but they are not. Have you seen the topic about gypsy mansions? I can guarantee you that they are for real. 

In Romania, most of the police is afraid of them - no pressure from there; 
there are numerous social laws made especially for them - granting them benefits in education and other, sometimes being harder to get in a public school class for non-Rroma children; 
There have been many programs (mostly with UE funds) that provided them with houses - do you know what happened? They raised their horses inside and ended up trashing everything. Go figure.

Here is what happens. Please imagine yourself having *very* light moral values. What would you do? you'd try to get benefits from almost any situation, you would use brute force to intimidate, you'd beg on the streets (lots of money to make as a beggar) if you weren't bright enough to think of any other scam. You would steal and use any breach in the law system to get away with it. 

But hey, you'd act like a modern urban tzigan (gypsy).

Note that I am not speaking of nomad gypsies, not speaking about their way of living free and all that. Anyway I can't see how a nomad community could find it's place in the modern world. Simply because everything is already owned. There's no place left to go, especially in Europe. Would you welcome them on your lawn? 

It's not about their race, but about what they DO. Nobody questions that, still we speak of racism. 

One more thing: Romania is **not** Roma country. ""Romania"" doesn't come from ""Roma"". Or ""Rroma"".

This I agree about, but such a moral code would necessarily be based on human instinct. Most of us agree that murder is rude and incest unhealthy, but there is no indication that private property is a universal trait.

&gt; It's naive to think that one can abolish theft and violence by creating a monopoly institution called ""government"" that does exactly that.

Can't argue with you on that one.

&gt; A labor union cannot have monopoly on production in a free society because the employers can just fire their asses and hire workers that are willing to work for their money.

And that's the exact spot left- and right-anarchists split. When this happens, the workers will call out a general-strike, occupy the workplaces and collectivize production. This is the left anarchist definition of socialism, without a state. Now, the right anarchists wants to call out their protection agencies, and we might have a small civil war between ourselves should we ever grow large enough. Let's try to avoid that.

&gt;  Yes, you can. History has proven that all communist societies had states to enforce them.

Well, yes, except the libertarian communist societies that covered much of Spain during the Spanish Civil War 1936 – 1939. Even though the experiment eventually was shut down by the fascists, it proved Anarchy-Syndicalism works. 

&gt;  Anarchism is by nature individualistic

That has been argued for ages. It always boils down to ancient Greece anyways. Let's just say, we agree 100% on individual freedom. The only difference is the view on ownership over the means of production, the freedom of the shareholders to benefit from others work, or the freedom to keep the means of one's labor. 

&gt; You have to learn that socialism as a working system is never agreed to by socialists. 

Completely agree again. It can and will not happen. Just like there never can be a universal religion agreed upon by everybody, even though they all have similar definition, because they all have grown too far apart. 

&gt; Socialism as a philosophy needs to DIE, because it has been proven a gigantic failure everywhere it has ever been attempted.

Depends on definition. Authoritarian communism is dead. Social-democracy a success, but a step in the wrong direction. Trotskism hasn't been tried, but I have a feeling it would be really annoying, and Chavez authoritarian brand of socialism seems popular among the farmers, but will probably not lead to anything positive in the long term.

And you shouldn't dismiss Scandinavian countries. My country (Norway) is pretty much one of the biggest economic powers on the marketplace right now, our government run pension fund now owns literally 1% of all stocks in circulation in the Western world, and 1,7% of the stock values of the EU (even though we aren't members of the EU). So that pension fund is pretty much the biggest creditor on the international marketplace right now, and we are just 4,7 million people living here. So we're a tiny population with a lot of economic power on our hands. We could easily buy out all of New York in a day.

Btw, while most of that wealth is oil based, the government runs separate budgets for GDP with and without oil, and even without oil, private industry is running smoothly here, while we have a rock solid public sector as well. Our unemployment rate now is 2,7% (yesterday's numbers) and went down from 2,8% last quarter.

Other than the fact that most of these tweets are in English, there's nothing else to indicate that this is not the genuine Henry.

Besides, several other sources that help to substantiate this rumor have come out since then:

Something like 50% of US electricity generation in the US comes from coal, the majority of US coal production comes from surface mines, so it is probable that a large fraction of US electricity comes from surface mining of one sort or another.  Whether it is silly to call people out for using electricity is another matter, but the demand for cheap electricity is certainly a driver for this kind of mining.  Still.

&gt;The government and the corporations collude to make the population ignorant of the horrible things that are behind our modern lifestyle.

I don't think that they collude to make people ignorant, they simply don't call attention to things.  That is generally the role of the media or the public, apathy and an ingrained idea of what life should be like tends to clash with that of course, not to mention the fact that the level of reporting in the US media generally is appalling.

&gt;These organizations (along with religion) help to ensure that most people who DO know about these things not care.

It allows people to rationalise it, even whilst calling other out on the same thing (China, Iran, Russia, India etc...).  It will be interesting to see what the US looks like in 20 years time...

&gt;I don't think there's that many people out there nowadays that don't have at least a general idea of the shitty things we're doing.

Indeed, but apathy doesn't absolve one from responsibility (much like the fact that I can perfectly reasonably hold every American responsible for the actions carried out in their name by the US government, whether that is torture, other war crimes or their environmental positions)  They are your corporations and your government.  Obviously that isn't something that can just be leveled at the US, but then the US is the most prominent power at the moment (and of course local biases against the US - note that I am in Europe) tend to mean that foreign actions are easier to attack.

EDIT: Downvotes? Read a book. Start with Ambedkar's *What Congress and Gandhi Have Done to the Untouchables*.

[Gandhi on caste](http://www.trinicenter.com/WorldNews/ghandi5.htm):

(8) To destroy caste system and adopt Western European social system means that Hindus must give up the principle of hereditary occupation which is the soul of the caste system. Hereditary principle is an eternal principle. To change it is to create disorder. I have no use for a Brahmin if I cannot call him a Brahmin for my life. It will be a chaos if every day a Brahmin is to be changed into a Shudra and a Shudra is to be changed into a Brahmin.

(9) The caste system is a natural order of society. In India it has been given a religious coating. Other countries not having understood the utility of the caste system, it existed only in a loose condition and consequently those countries have not derived from caste system the same degree of advantage which India has derived.

It's the ""over the EU"" part that's a bit iffy, the meaning depending upon how precisely one thinks of ""over"". It's not like the EU is a single spot on the earth.

A satellite in either geostationary or geosynchronous orbit can see over 40% of the earth's surface, so it's quite possible for geostationary satellites over the equator to be visible from Europe.

According to Wikipedia, the 3 satellites used for [EGNOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Geostationary_Navigation_Overlay_Service) are INMARSAT 3-F1, INMARSAT 3-F2, and ARTEMIS. Both INMARSAT 3-F1 and 3-F2 are over the equator, at latitudes of 0.05 degrees S and 0.01 degrees N, respectively. ARTEMIS had a failure during launch, and ended up in an off orbit, which was later somewhat corrected. It's at 6.45 degrees S, still within the equatorial band (which isn't precisely 0 degrees, but rather a certain range near the equator). You can see individual locations [here](http://www.n2yo.com/?s=23839|24307|26863).

So if by ""over the EU"" they mean ""right above the geometrical center of various countries that are part of the EU), then no, the satellites aren't over the EU. But if by ""over the EU"" one means ""over that part of the earth which includes the EU, then yes. These satellites are at distances of near 6x the radius of the earth, so some fudging about the precise spot on the surface of the earth closest to them isn't unexpected.",t5_2qh16,,0,c0dx9uo,0,t3_9q615

How did you arrive at this conclusion? 

The influence of secularizing societies has diminished greatly. Western Europe used to dominate the world, now it's just a shade of its former power. What does enlightenment has to do?

If a natural speaker of a language and a foreign speaker of a language talk, the natural speaker will automatically be on their home turf. This is a deal breaker in international politics (as far as the official business goes).

The biggest problem with a ""neutral"" language is that it will be a dead language. Created by committee, it will never have the natural vivacity of a language that grew organically. Nobody will speak it as their first language, and it will never have the subtlety and expressiveness that comes from long centuries of use and growth.

At least with English, there are some people who can converse fluently from childhood, and others have every opportunity to learn it too.

With a fake language, nobody will be able to speak it well because there will be no ""well"". Policy-making and legislation will be robbed of even the opportunity for graceful, nuanced, eloquent debate.

My perspective on this has solidified considerably since living in a country (Malaysia) where a language is being forced on people. The language isn't entirely fake, but it's been pulled from obscurity and inflated as a matter of politics. Half the population barely speak it, and it lacks the vocabulary for science and the terseness for business, but nevertheless it is required to be used in schools and in various government transactions. The consequence has been that people resort to English - which is nobody's first language here - when they really need to get things done. Parents pull their kids out of government schools so they can be taught proper English, or pay for hours each day of extra tuition. Even many politicians deliver their speeches in English. English newspapers are distinctly in the minority circulation-wise but attract 50% of ad spending because anyone who has money to spend chooses to identify themselves with the anglophone demographic.

I wouldn't expect it to work any differently in Europe. Language is too complex a cultural phenomenon to be dictated by bureaucrats. It is first and foremost a tool for communication, and I've seen firsthand that people will gladly jettison their cultural linguistic allegiance if it gets in the way of language's real purpose.

Just tonight I was out with a group of people who are the theoretical beneficiaries of Malaysia's language policy. They laugh at me when I ask for help improving my Bahasa Malaysia. Stopped by the police at a sobriety checkpoint, there was an amusing passive-aggressive battle between the police officer, who insisted on speaking Bahasa Malaysia (though he cheerfully spoke English with me, a foreigner), and my friends, who insisted on speaking English back to him.

If they are willing to concede that genetic traits are past through reproduction then you are lucky.  If they are not willing to concede this then you will fail in your argument because they are not accepting evidence.

After this you just have to find a genetic trait that exists but would decrease the survivability of a creature in certain settings.  If you can get them to buy pathogen resistance you are half way there (pheloxera epidemic in European rootstock grape vine might work (and you are really luck if it does because you can link it to small pox epidemic in the Americas after European arrival)).  Either way you have to attempt to sell them that this happens, slightly faster animals survive, animals that can live in the cold (warm blooded), virtually any trait that would increase survivability.

And then link it to humans.  This can be difficult, but once more, you are not selling them yet on the idea of amino acid-&gt;humans yet.  Just genetic changes over time.  Heck you can just do Adam &amp; Eve-&gt; different races adjusted slightly to different places, I have used races pretty well because it is difficult to reject some differences, and that some races are more suited for them homeland than others.
There, they just have accepted the presence of survival of the fittest induced evolution on a relatively small scale (aka not millions and millions of years).  

This is still an virtually impossible leap from that and rejecting creationism and accepting evolution as the creator of earths biologic diversity, but there is no argument that will do this.  Asking them to expand evolution over the long term is asking many creationists to reject to much of what they believe.  

The question to me is why you would want to make the next step?  If it is just for the sake of winning the argument then go ahead, but most likely you will never agree.

That's why I said ""Please be careful not to"".

There are plenty of people in circumcising cultures (that is, the U.S.) right now who are using your post to justify circumcising their healthy sons.

&gt; I have no regrets, I don't feel the same kind of attachment that other guys have to a **small piece of skin.**

I'm glad that you have no regrets, but I take issue with your rationalization of a ""small piece of skin"".

Circumcision generally removes [15 square inches](http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/) of tissue, especially in North America where it has been popular to have ""high and tight"" circumcisions for which there is pretty much zero tissue mobility even when flaccid; upon erection, many American penises are ""tight as a drum"". Here's a study that showed [51%-76%](http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/) of the tissue along the shaft might be removed by neonatal circumcision.

Moreover, the inner foreskin (something you may have never seen) is not skin at all, but smooth and [ridged mucosa](http://knol.google.com/k/george/the-ridged-band-of-the-human-prepuce/2y9nanfagw8nr/7#), the latter of which is packed with fine-touch receptors that provide exquisite erogenous sensation upon the normal pumping of the retracted foreskin; the ridged band along with much of its connection to the frenulum are essentially eradicated by standard circumcision.

It's anything but a small piece of ""skin"".

**As an aside:**

Did your surgeon ever discuss the possibility of [preputioplasty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preputioplasty) instead?

- Look for deals in airfare, and try to plan your flight far in advance. I only spent $900 to fly from L.A. to Spain and back, which meant I could spend more on the trip itself.
- Avoid taxis when you can, especially in the major cities, and try to walk or use public transportation options. Depending on your destination, most of the points of interest may be within walking distance anyhow.
- Pack light, as this will allow you to be more independent, and will cut down on costs in various ways (you won't have to pay extra to store your luggage, and you will be free to take the subway rather than springing for a taxi, and so forth).

GPS + a differential base that is local (i.e. another GPS unit) gives sub meter.

GPS with carrier phase capability (a hack that the people who developed GPS did not foresee) plus a carrier phase base station (i.e. a carrier phase differential base) can give a couple of centimeters horizontal and usually a bit worse vertical.

You can buy a carrier phase rover (RTK unit) and use a subscription service to a network of bases and get roving 2cm (ish). If you are, for example, in the wrong position wrt a building though it drops to 2m (if WAAS is available) or 10+m (if it isn't). So, forex, in an urban canyon even the best equipment often fails to give 2cm or even .5m.

Now the kicker. A WAAS or EGNOS receiver costs a few hundred. A WAAS receiver with averaging costs nothing more (averaging is usually built in). An RTK costs &gt;&gt;10K plus the cost of the subscription.

If you are in an area without WAAS, 10m at best is what you get. Suddenly having WAAS or equivalent is a huge bonus (2m is enough for most non-surveying, non autonomous vehicle problems, whereas 10m is often NOT good enough).

So while it is true that historically in Europe you could get cm accuracy, that is like saying your personal vehicle can fly, and neglecting to mention that you spent a fortune buying a helicopter. The average GPS doesn't get 2cm or anything like it, and STILL doesn't. RTK surveying systems can (sometimes).

There you were just herding a goat minding your own business and BAM! Average length concussion scar.  It was enough to make a person feel like beings greater than himself were up in the sky trying to kill him.

No surprise the Old Germanic and Old Norse words for hail are also related to the words for hazard.  The normal human thing to do at this point when something so completely out of your control happens is to find some way to make it mean something.  One would normally expect violence and animal sacrifices at this point, but the paleolithic people did something better.  They cracked open the hailstones to examine them.  And they were surprised to see the hexagonal lattice of ice crystal.  Unlike earthbound ice, it seemed to trace out strange designs before it melted into water.

In their need to assign structure to dangerous and incomprehensible forces, they locked onto the [fearful symmetry](http://www.artofeurope.com/blake/bla2.htm) of chunks of ice.  Now they could have gone hog-wild with inventing gods at this point, but they didn't.  They decided that this design was there in the universe all by itself, a state of [potentiality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginnungagap).  They decided that this was primordial matter, the original state of the world before it was heated by primordial energy, and that their world was the area in-between where matter and energy met.  Very heady stuff.

So heady that I would suspect that the ancient goat-herd brought the hail-stone to his ancient geek neighbor who would have made a good redditor.  The approach to their problem was level-headed and dare I say, scientific.  And how they built upon it.  They recorded patterns found in hailstones and formulated a set of runes which were used as portents for centuries but also brought alphabetic writing to Europe.

In the near east, alphabetic symbols originated as a solution to the problem of contractual law.  And so in the early pre-literate days, writing was seen as a sorcerous ability that could bind a person to their word.  On the other hand, today in the middle east the Koran is lovingly copied letter by letter with the intent being to preserve what was truly written.  Similarly, because in Europe writing was a way to codify and interpret the dangers outside of our immediate human sphere, in the pre-literate days it was seen as an irresponsible source of power for sorcerers who would lay waste with vast natural forces.  And in western culture now literacy is valued for its ability to allow us to interpret and learn from the natural world with science and to partake of other points of view with literature.

Whatever they say during election campaigns, center left and center right parties alternatively adopt roughly the same economic policy. This is called “liberalism” or “neoliberalism” in Europe.  It has one guiding principle: the task of government is to coddle and cajole finance capital into investing in the national economy.  This means not only enacting measures called “reforms” designed to increase profits at the expense of labor and social costs.  It also entails privatizing well-functioning public services in order to give investment capital a crack at skimming off profits that might otherwise go to benefit employees and the public.

Explain the Palestinian immigration to America then?

A few immigrants here and there is not exactly an open-doors policy, and it also does not mean any persecuted person can immigrate.

Some can immigrate because they have family ties, some have PhD's, some get work visas, and so on. Only a select few can come.

&gt; The same could be said for the millions of Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, and other Eastern Europeans who were slaughtered by the Nazis. The immigration policy of America in the 1940s has little relevance to a discussion of the world today.

Millions of Jewish Poles, you mean?  Because millions of non-Jewish Poles were not murdered by the Nazis.  Others who were killed at war were not slaughtered and worked to death systematically as part of a holocaust, but killed in a war.  The Jews had been persecuted for a couple millenia by the time the Nazis started slaughtering them.

If America had opened its doors, millions of Jews could escape.

If Israel has been established, they could escape.

But the Jews had no option of escape, and were caught and killed by the Nazi machine.

It has all the relevance to the discussion today - because it establishes the necessity of Israel's immigration policy during WWII. Do you really think that Jewish persecution of the last 2 millenia is over now?

&gt; Untrue. Palestinian immigration has been specifically discouraged by America, and Palestinians are often unfairly regarded as security risks. Not to mention the obvious fact that due to the circumstance of being forced off their land, Palestinians are in a very disadvantaged socioeconomic status which makes immigration to Western countries difficult which often requires money or educational attainment.

Having made his money, Mark has decided that nobody else should get rich, and that is why he’s set about de-stabilizing our economy with his Linux software. Because Mark is a born-again commie (the worst kind) he gives Ubuntu away for free to everyone: free, free, free! But don’t ask Mark for any money, he won’t give you any of that. He will only give you a stupid Ubuntu disk. The money he keeps!

While Vista is a slick, professional and scalable OS, Ubuntu is only kept ‘free’ by the judicious use of cheap, South African labor, often using intimidation, threats, and even outright violence to keep workers in line, slavishly marching towards the Ubuntu Management team’s brutal deadlines.

This statement is a complete non sequitur. I never claimed there was zero Palestinian immigration to America, so I don't have anything to defend. You, on the other hand, claimed that ""Jews cannot go to America and Europe"".

&gt; Because millions of non-Jewish Poles were not murdered by the Nazis.

Actually, 3 million non-Jewish Poles **were** murdered in the Holocaust, in camps, just like the Polish Jews were.

It's amazing that you think you know so much about Jewish persecution and Jewish suffering, but are completely ignorant of the fact that millions of _goyim_ were killed in the exact same camps as your precious ancestors.

Your obsession with Jewish victimhood and simultaneous disregard and ignorance of the historical suffering of other ethnic groups is a classic sign of the chauvinistic Jewish persecution complex.

Similarly, you cannot accept that the Palestinians have experienced just as much persecution and strife and deserve a homeland as much as your people. 

&gt; Do you really think that Jewish persecution of the last 2 millenia is over now?

Every race, colour and creed has been persecuted in the course of human history. The Jewish persecution complex has become vastly overinflated compared to the minor reality of actual anti-Semitism in the world and the relatively privileged socioeconomic status of most Jews relative to many ethnic groups. It's gotten to the ridiculous extent that legitimate concern for the plight of Palestinians living in refugee camps is interpreted as part of some vast, nefarious conspiracy against the Jews.

But I guess this is the inevitable outcome of what happens when you teach your children that the world is out to get them.

I think you might be right. I have a technology blog and some Indian commenters are ridiculously polite, even humble, like their question begins with ""Respected Sir"" while all of my Western commenters beging with something like ""Hello"". I was always kind of embarrassed about it, I might know a bit more about some technical topics but it doesn't mean you should behave like a serf talking to a prince or something: we are in it together. I'm not a fucking baron just because I've began to work with some technology 5 years before than you.,

OTOH there are kinda rude and feeling-entitled folks who write like ""I need X for Y. Please send to email address Z."" and their e-mail address too looks very much like an Indian one (of course it can also be Pakistani or Bangladeshi.) Which has the opposite effect on me, if you need a favour  shouldn't you be, you know, _asking_ for a favour as opposed to letting me know you want it?

So it is really strange to have some Indians embarassingly too polite and humble when asking for help and some other Indians totally rude and act as if they are entitled to help and support from strangers without even politely asking for it.

The reasonable middle ground - politely asking for a favour but doing as something beween equals - seems to be nonexistent in Indian culture.

Caste differences could go a long way to explain it, indeed. **I think you totally nailed it: it is caste.**

 First guy was what we Europeans (500 years ago) would call a serf or servant or  something (low-caste), the second guy was what we would call a prince or baron (again 500 years ago), high-caste. 

My attitude is that I help the ""serf"", but tell the ""prince"" to fuck himself until he learns some manners. 

I having nothing against the idea of aristocracy, I'm not a hardcore egalitarian, I can accept inequality as long as people high in the hierarchy live up to the expectations of noblesse oblige. Otherwise not.

If you are high-caste, you have to behave like a gentleman, according to my European way of thinking. Are you an aristocrat? Prove that you deserve this caste distinction by behaving like a perfectly polite gentleman. Don't attempt to make me feel you are somehow entitled to a favour. If you are an aristocrat, behave like a gentleman, ask for favours politely.",t5_2qh0u,,0,c0dxqnf,0,t3_9q4z8

I have no idea whether this is true; I couldn't find any mention of it online or elsewhere. However, the fact that it might be used as a binding agent for drugs doesn't in itself mean anything. Presumably, you mean that ions produced in the pharmaceutical industry are bound to fluoride ions to make them into salts that can be packaged as pills. 

&gt;so with other anti-biotics, anti-depressants, and any other number of chems already in the water, plus fluoride in many forms being added, it just makes it bad.

Why, exactly? I'm not sure what you're saying here. I think you're trying to suggest that the effects of the pharmaceuticals are somehow exacerbated by the presence of fluoride-- but this does not make sense. If fluorine *is* used as a binding agent, that means it's essentially packaging; it's used to make salts out of ions. Once those ions are dissolved in water, the fluoride doesn't do anything. The pharmaceuticals, being dissolved, enter your body and work on your system either way.

&gt;what is included as being ""sodium fluoride"" is a huge number of chemical compounds, that are all legal to add to the water under the name ""sodium fluoride"".

Uhh, no. Sodium fluoride is one chemical compound, a salt, that can be delivered as a powder and dissolved in water without any help. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you meant that the fluoride ion *itself* comes in many different compounds. This is true; ions can't be shipped on their own, so water fluoridation projects use ionic compounds containing fluorine. Sodium fluoride is a common one; fluorosilicic acid and sodium fluorosilicate are two others.

If that fact is what worries you, you shouldn't be worried. Wherever you are, you can be certain that your local government's procedure is well-documented and that they only use specific fluoride-containing compounds that are known to be safe. 

&gt;i dont have the citation, but I heard that large doses of sodium fluoride actually make a person passive and dull.

Find the citation and I'll consider it. I can't find anything.

&gt;nazis did put large doses of sodium fluoride in the water.

The Nazis did a lot of things, like eat and sleep and wear clothing. Eating and sleeping and wearing clothing are not wrong. The fact that they fluoridated water does not make fluoridating water wrong.

As for the European report, I had a look and it basically said that fluoridating water makes it a ""two-purpose beverage,"" a ""medicine,"" and that public water supplies should be water and only water-- concerned people can add their own fluoride.

Wall Street Journal
Jun 18, 1996

The measure, which the House is expected to approve today with the Clinton administration's blessing, infuriates some of the U.S.'s closest European allies. Last week in an undiplomatic outburst, the European Union's top executive turned to President Clinton during a joint news conference to complain that it wasn't ""justifiable or effective for one country to impose its tactics on another.""

But for Aipac, known formally as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the measure isn't just a way to fight international terrorism. It offers the chance for a comeback of sorts, a badly needed way to burnish its own image. Aipac isn't a political-action committee; it is the chief U.S. lobbying group for Israel and is financed by private fund-raising in this country.

Aipac staffers insist that it is business as usual -- they are working on Capitol Hill to promote Israel's interests. But the group's interest in Iranian terrorism at least partly reflects a recent dilemma. Over the past few years, Israel's active pursuit of peace with its Arab neighbors and warm ties with Washington made Aipac's mission less clear. The group no longer needed to mobilize its troops to thwart U.S. arms sales to Arab states or vilify Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Instead, American Jews were divided over issues such as the future of Jerusalem and the prospect of a Palestinian state.

""The consensus surrounding Israel has diminished and this, among other things, has reduced somewhat the centrality of Aipac in the American Jewish community,"" says Benjamin Ginsberg, a Johns Hopkins University professor who writes on American-Jewish politics.

Aipac's funk began in 1992 when Israeli voters elected the Labor Party's Yitzhak Rabin as prime minister, ending 15 years of dominance by the hard-line Likud bloc. On a visit here, Mr. Rabin met privately with Aipac's top leaders, many of whom are conservative and cozy with Likud. The new prime minister read them the riot act, gruffly telling Aipac officials that he would conduct foreign policy directly with the White House and that they should stay out of the way.

Shocked and searching for a way to remain relevant, Aipac hit upon the perfect vehicle -- Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. Since 1993, the New York Republican had been offering sweeping Iran sanctions bills. Despite the general animosity toward Tehran, the bills languished in Congress. Aipac recognized that all that was needed was an organized effort to refine the legislation and push it through. The lobbying group decided to become the locomotive.

When the Republicans took over Congress in early 1995 and Sen. D'Amato became chairman of the Banking Committee, the bill's fortunes -- and Aipac's -- were about to change. The administration regularly attacked Iran's support of international terrorism and urged its allies not to do business with Tehran. Then, thanks partly to an Aipac research paper shared with the White House, the administration learned to its embarrassment that **U.S. oil companies were Iran's biggest customers by far.**

In March of last year, to show its resolve, the White House intervened to stop Conoco Inc., the energy unit of DuPont Co., from going ahead with plans to help develop two Iranian oil fields. But casting the spotlight on Iran also gave Sen. D'Amato's bill momentum. Soon, the administration was conducting separate discussions with the senator's office and with Aipac.

Sen. D'Amato's bill focused on imposing U.S. penalties on foreign companies for trading with Iran. (The bill also includes sanctions against Libya, though Iran remains Aipac's principle focus.) But the administration, believing such a sweeping bill would violate international trade law, suggested another approach: it would punish foreign companies that in the future invested at least $40 million in Iran's energy sector, which is vital to its economy. The sanctions would include barring U.S. Export-Import Bank support on sales to those foreign companies and would ban such companies from receiving loans of more than $10 million from a U.S. financial institution. The administration hoped such an approach would be less offensive to America's allies. Aipac, recognizing the broader appeal of such a measure, signed on. So did Sen. D'Amato. The bill moved through the Senate with no opposition.

Next, Aipac prepared for a tougher fight in the House, where powerful interests traditionally oppose so-called secondary boycotts. In a world-wide campaign closely coordinated with Sen. D'Amato, Aipac and the New York Republican helped raise the stakes by publicizing pending business deals involving foreign firms and Iran.

In February of this year, for instance, the Australian Jewish Review published an article saying that Broken Hill Proprietary Co., Australia's largest company, was about to sign a $1 billion deal with Iran. A few days later, the Australian Financial Review's Washington correspondent wrote a similar report, including a letter to the firm by Sen. D'Amato. The company, under pressure, denied that such a deal was pending.

Meanwhile, the House International Relations Committee approved a bill that included certain trade sanctions and was tougher than Sen. D'Amato's measure. But GOP Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee that also has jurisdiction, strongly opposed trade sanctions.

With the two House committees at loggerheads, Aipac played the key role of go-between, sitting with Ways and Means staffers in the office of Thelma Askey, staff director of the panel's trade subcommittee, to try to resolve differences. In recent weeks, Aipac won support for a measure favored by the International Relations Committee that could lower the investment threshold to $20 million after a year if other nations don't agree to join the U.S. effort against Iran. But Aipac failed in efforts to extend sanctions to banks that finance energy deals in Iran. The Senate is expected to accept the House's version of the final bill.

Ironically, the recent election victory of Israel's hard-line Likud party, which is likely to stall peace talks, could create tensions between the U.S. and Israel -- and re-energize Aipac's basic mission. ""If Clinton tries to put pressure on Israel,"" says Morris Amitay, a former executive director of Aipac, ""he'll find that Aipac will be working with a lot of people in Congress, particularly the Republican majority, who will be happy to take on the White House.""

Let's start with an extreme consideration, full blown European socialism.  There can be some high moral reasons for that.  But there are also some severe challenges:  It's easy for such socialism to make things worse.  Actually, from 40,000 feet up, broadly, it's quite difficult for socialism to make things better.  Maybe the French do it, but they have a special system of 'civil service' with educational and quality standards so high nearly no one in the US would have a weak little hollow hint of a meager chance of passing.  Broadly in the US, we don't do socialism well.

There is a LOT of incompetence in the world.  In the US we try to weed out the incompetence at small scales and not let rise to control big things.  In this, sometimes we fail and pay a big price.  Whenever we centralize something important, we have to be VERY careful that some incompetent, drooling doofus doesn't soon run it.  The only large government organizations in the US I know of that qualify as well run are the DoD and the NIH.

In medicine, there is a big rule:  ""Do no harm"".  So, medicine no longer makes wild guesses and trys this and trys that.  Instead, medicine starts by being VERY careful on diagnosis.  Poorly done socialized medicine in the US could do a LOT of harm:  Yes, it could waste money.  But worse, it could seriously hurt the quality of care that is there now which, at its best, is the envy of the world.

So, I'm not against socialism in principle, but generally it's too difficult to do well in the US.

So, I'm not just saying that all socialism is bad.  And I'm not saying that all steps closer to socialism are bad.  But, we want to ""do no harm"" and actually end up with something better and not worse.  So, let's consider that.

Generalities aside, let's be more specific:

What about the ""public option""?

Well, in

Starting around page 41 you will see that this bill has a 'Commissioner'.  Then will notice that basically this guy is a dictator, a 'Commissar', not elected, with next to nothing in supervision, accountability, liability, or checks or balances.  This guy gets to specify essentially everything about US health care from insurance coverages, reimbursement schedules, what medical procedures, drugs, equipment get reimbursed at all, what people have to pay in whatever replaces 'medical insurance', draws deficits from the Treasury (you will see that actually much of HR 3200 is revisions to the IRS code), etc.  There will be 'statistics' used to decide what medical procedures can be used -- big, HUGE mathematical problem:  What your physician sees specifically for you as he studies your case has to be ignored; BIG bummer.  Will KILL people.

So, in short, this 'Commissiooner' gets to set coverages and prices, say, what has to be sold and what the prices are.  So, there is no longer any market.  Uh, can we think of anywhere that was tried for some decades, uh, somewhere between eastern Poland and the western Pacific, and finally given up as a disaster?  Can such a thing be made to work?  Perhaps, and maybe to some extent they do it in France, but sure killed tens of millions of people in Russia.  There's no doubt:  Such things can take something pretty good and make it much worse.

So, with a 'public option' and then 'single-payer', there is less than the thickness of an onion skin between HR 3200 and a full Federal takeover of essentially all of the US health care system.

So, essentially everything about that system, including research and development on new drugs, devices, and procedures, will be under the solid control of that one Commissar.  So this is essentially JUST socialized medicine, Federal Government medicine.  Period.

Maybe in France with their astoundingly high standards for civil service they can make that work.  In the US?  Big, HUGE, risk of violating ""Do no harm"".  Net, you will be on the way to medical disasters -- that is, dead people -- that will cause you to scream out in prayer for a return to our present system.  It's your life, too.  Be careful what you wish for because you might get it.

Uh, you can see that the Bill Gates foundation recently sold all their health care stocks!

Is our present health care system perfect?  No.  But, if you have a leak at your kitchen sink, do you tear down the whole neighborhood to fix it?

Can we improve the US health care system?  Yes.

Will making the US health care system, net, better be easy?  NO!!!!  Net, for anything like HR 3200 or anything so far being seriously considered in Congress, actually improving the US health care system is way, way, way TOO darned difficult.  Those guys are making rotten sausage you don't want to eat but will have no alternative.

Or, definitely at

http://www.facs.org/news/obama081209.html

should see the statement of the American College of Surgeons that some of Obama's statements on health care in July and August were:

""alarming, completely wrong, dangerous, ill-informed, incorrect, inflammatory, mistakes, not based on fact, uninformed"".

That's about the most angry, contemptuous slap down of a US President possible by an important professional society.  Is the health care system you want for yourself and family the one from such incompetent, irresponsible, dangerous leadership?

We're talking Quacktopractic Obama doing open heart surgery on the US health care system with a rusty pocket knife.  Then, maybe YOU are the next patient in line.

Uh, Obama also wants to unionize the health care system.  Uh, can buy the whole GM Saturn car company for $0.00.  Take it for free, lock, stock, and barrel.  GM might even pay you to take it.  Why?  Unions.  You will be stuck with the UAW that still wants to do things the old way, the way that made Detroit what it is today.  Pensky never wanted Saturn; he only wanted the brand name and distribution.  His idea was to have the cars made by others and NOT the present UAW Saturn plant.  Pensky's not a fool.  Details, from a real expert, are at

http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704471504574447122719252350.html?mod=googlenews_wsj

You want unionized health care?  Are you sure?  Answer carefully.

Got to be disconnected from reality and naive and gullible in the extreme to believe that the nonsense in Congress and from Obama is to improve the US health care system.  Instead the goal is more in money and power for some selected people, and the US health care system will be a sacrificed pawn.  It's greedy, sleazy, incompetent, irresponsible, dangerous, corrupt Chicago-style politics.  The IOC saw it with crystal clarity from across the Atlantic, was angry at the insult to the dignity of the IOC, and ASAP slapped Obama down HARD.  The guy is sleazy, incompetent, irresponsible, and an HUGE embarrassment to the US.  We need to start placing bets on the month when he leaves office.

Look, it's clear:  That Chicago nonsense is all Obama knows.  Maybe he'd be good at selling strange looking kitchen knives on late night TV.  Otherwise he's sleazy, incompetent, irresponsible, and dangerous.  It's time to get angry for being asked to listen to his nonsense, solidly reject his nonsense, start laughing at what he says, ignore him, and hope he leaves office soon.

For improving the US health care system, we have to wait for a new president, e.g., one we can trust to do open heart surgery.  In the meanwhile we should be very careful to ""Do no harm"".

Historical examples of using energy as a weapon? 

**Vladimir Putin threatens Europe over energy supply**

By Damien McElroy
01 Sep 2008

Vladimir Putin has warned Europe that Russia’s energy reserves will flow to the Far East if the continent’s leaders seek to punish his country for invading Georgia.



The US has threatened Iran.

Wording of US congress HRH resolution 362 (2008)

(3) demands that the President initiate an international effort to immediately and dramatically increase the economic, political, and diplomatic pressure on Iran to verifiably suspend its nuclear enrichment activities by, inter alia, **prohibiting the export to Iran of all refined petroleum products;** imposing stringent inspection requirements on all persons, vehicles, ships, planes, trains, and cargo entering or departing Iran; and prohibiting the international movement of all Iranian officials not involved in negotiating the suspension of Iran's nuclear program; 


Do you think owning nuclear weapons is a waste of time, They could only be used in an Apocalyptic future nightmare, so whats the point? No one cares if you have a nuke or not?

Don't you think nations care if you can throttle off there energy supply or not?    Dont you think it effects your attitude to someone if you know they can strangle you?  Do you think ""provoking ire"" comes into it?

Many African slaves in America were falsely blamed for crimes they did not commit, and then swiftly lynched for it. Why does it matter whether African slaves were blamed for economic problems or not when they were bing kept as animals and denied natural justice? Jews were NEVER held in slavery by Europeans, which is far worse than being occasionally blamed for economic recessions, and in fact they participated in the slave trade of Africans.

Also, it's obviously false that anti-Semitism has been occurring in Europe for two thousand years, since Jews weren't even in Europe two thousand years ago. The first European ""anti-Semites"", the Romans, had practical reasons to imprison and expel Jews, since the province of Judaea was in an almost constant state of violent revolt, fought by Jewish Zealots, the ancient equivalent of religious terrorists. They would have treated any other religious group the same, and persecuted Christians far more.

Medieval Christians may have blamed Jews but they also blamed black cats and dogs, old woman (witches), demons and Musselmen for their troubles.  In the same period, genocide was committed against the Cathars by Crusaders, who also killed thousands in the Holy Land. Jews were just one of the many victims of ignorance, but yet again you act like Jews are the only group that suffered during that period.

No. No you didn't.

You're trying to compare the African slave trade with the history of antisemitism in Europe, when they're apples and oranges.

Africans were enslaved party out of racist bigotry, partly for the same reasons that other African tribes enslaved other Africans and sold them off: economic and political necessity and gain. 

Blacks were not enslaved for killing Christ, controlling the economy, or killing Christian children to use their blood in Matzoh bread. These are examples of scapegoating and pogroms. 

Being lynched for having erronously being accused of raping a white girl would of course apply as a scapegoating pogrom and are sickening, but the frequency and scale of these occurrences are simple much less than that of antisemitic uprisings throughout European history.

citation please.

&gt; It's amazing that you think you know so much about Jewish persecution and Jewish suffering, but are completely ignorant of the fact that millions of goyim were killed in the exact same camps as your precious ancestors.

There were concentration camps, and death camps.  Most goyim were sent to concentration camps in which some died, but that wasn't their purpose. They were more of a ""severe jail"".  6 million Jews and **one million** non-Jews were sent to the death camps. Many millions more were just worked in concentration and work camps.

&gt; Your obsession with Jewish victimhood and simultaneous disregard and ignorance of the historical suffering of other ethnic groups is a classic sign of the chauvinistic Jewish persecution complex.

You just got your facts wrong.  Plenty of others suffered, but there aren't that many groups (nomads are one) who suffered persecution as consistently and systematically over millenias as the Jews did.

&gt; Similarly, you cannot accept that the Palestinians have experienced just as much persecution and strife and deserve a homeland as much as your people.

Really, just as much?  Where did Palestinian mothers have to choose which of their children to send to the death camps?  When were they worked to death?  When did they stand in lines to be selected for death or for work?

Anyway, that's irrelevant, I do think they ""deserve"" a home-land in Gaza and the West Bank.

&gt; Every race, colour and creed has been persecuted in the course of human history. The Jewish persecution complex has become vastly overinflated compared to the minor reality of actual anti-Semitism in the world and the relatively privileged socioeconomic status of most Jews relative to many ethnic groups.

That's bullshit.  Most creeds were persecuted at *some* point. Jews were **consistently and repeatedly** persecuted for many millenia.

As for the Palestinians in refugee camps -- don't you find it **ridiculous** to blame Jews for that, when they've been in those camps for about 60 years now, and those are **not even in Israel**.  Why don't you blame Lebanon for their mistreatment of Palestinian inhabitants for 60 years?  And Syria, and Libya?

&gt; But I guess this is the inevitable outcome of what happens when you teach your children that the world is out to get them.

If you actually look at the history of Jews in Europe, specifically in Russia and Spain, or if you then look at Israel in 1921, 1929, 1936, 1948, 1967, 1973 -- it **does seem like people are out to get the Jews**.

Honestly, I don't really understand the treaty. I don't know what it means. Anytime I've looked into it, the EU seems like a massive clusterfuck to me full of inefficient bureaucrats where nothing ever really gets done. In the end, the main reason I voted Yes was because of a ""don't bite the hand that feeds you"" sort of mentality. Also, I really REALLY don't trust Declan Ganley / Libertas or Sinn Fein - the two main parties who were for a No vote. 

&gt; It can't be that someone on the 'no' side had some connection to Republicans? It seems like a big enough campaign that people on the 'yes' side probably did as well...

Fair enough, but I've never come across any evidence that there was American influence at work on the ""Yes"" side. If anything, there was more of a European influence at work on the ""Yes"" side and I wouldn't be suprised if there was some dodgy stuff going on in the background by the current government. For example, the government recently passed a ridiculous 'blasphemy' law which may have been an attempt to put people in favour of a more progressive, secular EU where free-speech is upheld over religious freedom.

&gt; It's probably fueled in part by some embarrassment

I don't know, as [jules1888 pointed out](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/9qhkx/from_a_brit_to_our_american_couzins_i_know_you/c0dykl0?context=2), I don't think contemporary Brits' emotional reaction to US Independence is ""oh dear, so embarrassed, we lost a colony we wanted to keep forever"", more like ""well, that was logical / inevitable"".  Modern Brits are more likely to embarrassed about having a colony in the first place than the fact it (rightly) became independent.

That said, I'm talking of people of my generation or younger, I guess there were plenty of people of the generation setting the curiculum in the 70s who were still merrily jingoistic about militarist imperialism and expansionism and as such would be embarrassed by any defeat.

So basically I'm saying its absence from our curriculums may be fueled in part by some embarrassment, but I don't think that reflects general embarrassment that you're independent in the British public these days.

&gt; But I do think that it doesn't hurt for the British to mention it

I can't speak for everyone but it was mentioned for me - it came in as we skipped through

&gt; Between 1750 and 1815, Britain was dealing with a lot of shit

However, it was really a passing mention, inasmuch as it fitted into the global background of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars.  Even then, that was at sixth form (16-18, where everything you do is elective).  Our compulsory history at school pretty much divided into ""Romans"", or ""WW1 onwards"", with the stuff in the middle, besides a perfunctory stop in 1066, not really covered: US independence was missing but not because it's US, since, say, the unification of the UK wasn't covered either.  I honestly don't know offhand what 1588 and 1707 were, I have guesses but I'd have to look it up to be sure. (Hard as that may be to believe in a country which mythologises its own formation so much).

I went on to study history at uni, looking back, on the one hand, you can decry that as very poor, incomplete history syllabus at school.

On the other hand, it's not such a simple story.  Previous generations of schoolkids in Britain would have rote memorised every monarch and military squabble from 1066 to present, but history as an academic discipline isn't about a memory test of ""everything wot happened"".  At school, our history classes when into a surprisingly mature degree of ""historiographical technique"", ie evaluation of sources, primary v secondary, bias, reliability, etc.  So although it may have been narrow in periods covered, it taught the techniques of research, inquiry and judgement, which is arguably a better thing for the educational system than a very broad but very shallow coverage of ""facts"".  

Likewise, with time inevitably limited, with ""those who don't learn from history are destined to repeat it"" in mind I think deeply educating people in the causes and horror of WW1 + WW2 is understandable from European education systems, compared to than everyone knowing about 1588 or 1776 which are so much more distant.

When I was about 14 everyone in school went on a week long tour of [Tyne Cot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyne_Cot), [Menin Gate](http://www.nationalwarmemorial.govt.nz/images/menin-gate-names-large.jpg), [Vimy Ridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_National_Vimy_Memorial) etc.  _(For the next sentence to have due impact: Open the links.  Take a moment to let it sink in that those names on the Menin Gate aren't ""all the dead"", or even ""All the_ British _dead"" but only ""all the_ missing _British dead"".  And there are_ 54,896 _of them.  Oh, and did I say ""all"", oops, this is one memorial amongst many, there's another 33,783 at Tyne Cot.  And you're_ 14_.)_  It's pretty obvious that this makes a far more profound difference to the development of pupils (well, me at least) as human beings and as world citizens than spending that week reading textbooks about the Stamp Act of 1765 or Charles I.",t5_6,,0,c0dyqiu,0,t3_9qhkx

To the No Campaign smoke blowers: A lot of the no-campaigners talk about the treaty like it's something that Europe pulled out of the air and foisted upon us. This is simply not the case. Irish EU civil servants and elected representatives negotiated the treaty and signed it already in LISBON. . 

The amendment of the constitution will allow certain powers to Lisbon, while other changes will STILL require referenda in this country, due to  existing and maintained constitutional law. See the guarantees section from your poll card.

To lay my own cards on the table, I voted No the first time as the EU refused to release publicly a full account of the treaty. I voted Yes on this occasion, because as a result of the Irish no vote, the EU fully disclosed the treaty and published it. 

This time round, the no campaign told spurious and disingenuous lies about pay and economic development. The Yes campaign said yes to jobs. The Yes campaign is in a roundabout way more correct. Ireland currently has no credibility with foreign lenders due to it's handling of the Anglo Irish Bank scandal. The ratification of the Lisbon treaty is a gesture of good will to Europe and it's finance. If Ireland had one good line of credit, we could pump-prime our economy into recovery by reinstating large government building contracts (western rail corridor for example) and energy development projects to provide jobs. So while the Yes campaign are partly hopeful in their Yes to Jobs slugline, there is more than a grain of truth. Which is more than can be said by the No campaign's extreme claim that wages would be reduced to 1.27 an hour for which i have seen no evidence other than possible loophole abuse, which Europe is in the business of shutting down quite efficiently. 

Lastly, after the way the Irish have run the country for the past 20 years, I feel a little more European input and regulation couldn't hurt. Any union or institution that maintains strict controls on bans of false advertising and providing subsidies to third world level countries that eventually turn into tiger economies as a result, is alright with me.",t5_2qh13,,0,c0dyqu5,0,t3_9qh78

Maybe you're Northern Irish? If you are British or French or German, and you didn't get to vote on the Lisbon treaty, it's your own country's fault. Ireland has a constitutional amendment referring to our agreements with Europe. If we want to change one of those agreements, we get a referendum. If your country doesn't have that system, that's your fucking fault.

Personally, I don't think that IS a good system anyway. A representative democracy involves voting for the candidate you trust the most to make your political decisions for you. There are almost no true direct democracies in existence. I'm Irish, I voted yes, but i would have preferred if we didn't have a referendum and our elected government made the decision for us.

A European common foreign policy would be very unlikely to be war-mongering. Britain was alone among major EU powers in supporting Iraq, and Blair got hammered for it domestically. Anyway, thanks to neutral countries like Ireland there are very clear opt-out clauses with reference to foreign policy in the agreement.

I don't know what you mean by 'kick-off', and i don't know why anyone would want to secede from the EU, but it's a fairly simple process. If a nation wants to secede, they simply elect an anti-EU party into government, and that government than secedes. Voilá!",t5_2qh13,,0,c0dyqxf,0,t3_9qh78

I have met and talked to both kinds here in the US without even trying to find any such thing, so from my perspective, it can't be all that rare. 

Some have estimated that India has the most slaves of any country. This is as much their large population as anything. These are mostly domestic servants and farm workers.

The so called EU president is really a symbolic position. He would represent the face of the EU on diplomatic missions.

Besides if the EU were able to set foreign policy which it doesn't have the power to do, Europe as a whole was against war mongering. Remember that picture in the British press of all the flags of the countries voting against the war in Iraq with Britain and the USA on one side and everyone else, including France and Germany on the other side? In this case who were the war mongers?

The EU does not have a foreign policy precisely because it is a federation of loosely allied states with similar (but not the same) political and economic goals. A common foreign policy would be unenforceable as would any kind of EU superstate. Europe is made of too many languages and cultures to form one coherent country, in stark contrast to say, the US of A. There will NEVER be a European superstate and we are not headed towards one because it is unworkable. But so is the current situation with a bunch of useless sheep without a herder, the EU is, as an American intelligence report stated, “a hobbled giant”.

If I'm being honest I'd prefer our (UK) foreign policy set by Europe.

Maybe we wouldn't have been so quick to keep the details of innocent individuals on a national DNA database. Maybe we would have been quicker to condemn Israel for her shameless actions at the beginning of the year.

It's easy to say that a few billion dark-skinned foreigners need to off themselves (because we've already _been_ telling them what to do for centuries, so why stop now?) to make room, rather than advocate something sane like legal limits on consumption (that's socialism!), or something equally insane (but more soundly reasoned if you accept the omnicidal logic in use) like a complete genocide of America and most of Europe (if this triggers a sensation of shock and revulsion, congratulations, you're still human).",t5_6,,0,c0dyz03,0,t3_9qjc3

2 - the amount of misinformation from the scaremonging of the 1st vote was insane (and in the dying days of this campaign with euthenasia and abortion being brought in which had absolutely no bearing on it, similarly military spending which remains purely a domestic decision) - plenty of people were annoyed at finding out they were lied to and taken for a ride, 1st time around.

Finally - this nonsense of this being an undemocratic process is just crap - in each case a vote was held and the government respected the decision - at NO POINT to the government act unilaterally and impose its will counter to what the people voted for.  IF the government went ahead and ratified the treaty without the approval of the people, THAT would be undemocratic.  In fact that is what has happened in the Czech republic - where the democratically elected parliament has voted overwhelmingly to endorse the treaty - and ONE MAN, the president - refuses to ratify it.  That is undemocratic.

If people dont like being asked to vote again - the democratic process is to elect a government next time which would campaign on an undertaking not to hold multiple votes.

One side of my family is a poor working class family from Ballymena. The other side of my family is a middle class land-owning family from Wexford. Both sides came to England after the war. I don't lay any claim to wanting to influence the decision in Ireland for the Irish. However the politics of Ireland directly affect those of the UK. I'm fully aware of the stunts pulled by UKIP and co, and for one I wouldn't normally agree - except for the fact that the Yes vote was funded by europe and the no vote was reliant on the likes of UKIP who wouldn't even be there if we were to have our own referendum.
I know Ireland has had problems with it's Taoiseachs in the past. God knows we've had trouble with our Prime ministers but it's wrong. It's wrong that we should be fucked over because Ireland votes yes. It's like Ireland's future being decided by a Romanian vote. It's ludicrous. Whether it's our own country's fault is irrelevant because what we're talking about is fundamentally changing the constitution of those countries. What is relevant is that these countries should be given a referendum - the reason is actually fairly clear. If you don't give country foo a referendum and you end up with a government that opposes EU membership what do you do? Do you put British troops on the streets of Dublin to protect EU cohesion because the government of the day wants to secede? That's the problem.
I respectfully understand your point about preferring that you didn't have a referendum and that the decision was made for you, but if it was brought into the debate for election it should be a defining factor/mandate in the general -having it as a referendum allows you to say 'fuck fine gael but I'm with them on issue X'.
You say that a European foreign policy would be very unlikely to be war-mongering but you're talking about the difference between Irish neutrality - something I think my country could learn a lot about - and losing that neutrality not through someone saying ""OK we're going to invade iraq"" (and bear in mind that would be the second time he says it) but through the loss of control. Ireland for what it's worth is exceptionally stable because of its neutral position. It's difficult to attack something neutral. Passing that control to the EU means that you can be forced into war regardless. Bear in mind that in the UK one of the biggest demonstrations of all time was against the very same EU President nominee's war mongering. If you think he has Ireland's interests at heart, I respectfully disagree.
Your final point about secession isn't strictly true. There's no means by which to secede from the EU (as far as I know and I would appreciate it if you point me in the right direction) because it is at heart a coal and steel treaty. No-one knows what would happen if someone secedes as it's unprecedented, but if the EU ever has a military capability then it would not be unrational to expect a military response. There is a difference between European cooperation (which I'm in favour of) and European subservience to an unaccountable body (which I'm not).

Defence of the Realm, the first authorised history of MI5, says there were worries about his relationships with Eastern European businessmen.

His contact with KGB officers also raised concerns.

However, the book, serialised in the Times, dismisses long-standing claims of bugging and plots against him.

Mr Wilson, who died in 1995 aged 79, was the only serving prime minister to have a permanent Secret Service file, according to the book's author Cambridge professor Christopher Andrew.

MI5 opened the dossier in 1945 when Mr Wilson became an MP after communist civil servants suggested he had similar political sympathies.

His file was so secret that he was given the pseudonym Norman John Worthington.

Sir Michael Hanley, MI5 director general from 1972, went to even greater lengths to conceal its existence by removing it from the central index, meaning any search would result in a ""no trace"".

Personal permission from Sir Michael was required to access it.

In his later years in office, Mr Wilson became increasingly obsessive about his belief that the secret services were bugging him and plotting against him.

The Times quotes from the book: ""Sitting in his study at Number Ten on his first day back in office [in February 1974], Wilson told [his business friend who Sir Michael Hanley said was not to be trusted with confidences] Lord Kissin of Camden 'there are only three people listening - you, me and MI5.

""Though MI5 was not, of course, listening in to the Prime Minister and had never actively investigated him, it still had a file on him which recorded, inter alia, his past contacts with Communists, KGB officers and other Russians.""

Harold Wilson, Labour leader for 13 years, led the country from 1964 to 1970, and then again from 1974 to 1976.

He introduced many permissive policies including decriminalising homosexual practices and legalising abortion.

His government is also remembered for the deteriorating relations with trade unions and the devaluation of the pound in 1967.

I have always opposed those wars and I only support war if its for self defense. I am extremely dismayed at US foreign policy, especially since Sept 11. US foreign policy hasn't changed much since Obama was elected, he said before he was elected that he would close down Guantanamo but now it looks as if he will renege on that promise.  Guantanamo, rendition and the war in Iraq are all illegal as far as I'm concerned. I hope that someday the people who planned these wars and policies are brought to justice. However, the way that the UN is structured it will be difficult to get them to act against the US. I could go on complaining about the US being a hegemony both militarily and financially. Also most of what I'm saying about the US could be used against the UK since they have gone along with everything that the US has done. 

I'm happy that Ahmadinejad turned out to be Jewish because it is hillarious and I think he deserved it because of the way the Iranian government reacted to the protesters after the election. I hope that Mousavi is eventually elected although it looks highly unlikely. I don't support economic sanctions against Iran because it will harm the innocent Iranian people.

It's predecessor had been a constitution, effectively a federalisation  creating a European superstate.  It didn't go down too well so they rewrote it, keeping in practically all of the provisions but, instead of replacing all the old treaties with a single constitution, they opted to rewrite or reword existing treaties to the same effect.  The Lisbon treaty does acknowledge that the EU Flag, the anthem, all the things already in everyday use aren't legally binding for an EU member state.  They essentially went through the constitution they'd written and removed all stately references without taking away much of the power....and this builds onto the big difference to what ratifying the EU treaty means from where it is at the moment.

Currently the EU has what they call [3 pillars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_pillars_of_the_European_Union).  

&gt;1. The first or 'Community' pillar concerns economic, social and environmental policies.

&gt;2. The second or 'Common Foreign and Security Policy' (CFSP) pillar concerns foreign policy and military matters.
   
&gt;3. The third or 'Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters' (PJCC) pillar concerns co-operation in the fight against crime. This pillar was originally named 'Justice and Home Affairs'.

If you'll notice the first pillar, which deals with things within the EU, was the only one to have legal personality - like a corporation.  With the Lisbon Treaty this changes: all three are amalgamated into one legal entity.  You'll have heard of the expression 'a state within a state' before.  This creates 'a state *outside* states'.  A legal entity which protects and acts for itself outside its own borders.

The other major thing it will bring in, or not address, is the already powerful Central Commission.  This body of 27 members drafts all EU legislation for 500 million people.  Member state governments get to choose one representative (their own constituents don't get to vote) - that's how it is now.  What they now want to do is allow the European *Council* (heads of state) to elect a president amongst them which has been dubbed President of the European Union.  This same council also elects a president to the European Commision, the one which drafts policy and holds executive power. What they have then is an appointed leader who does not represent any country in the EU but whose job is to think of what is best for the EU as a whole.  The 27 body European commission is also not elected by the people of Europe, more appointed by people elected to represent them who have derogated their duty.   Two presidents - neither elected by the people, one new position which would be administrative a European Union president for the European council made up of heads of state, and  one who heads a powerful executive of the European Commission.......&lt;drumroll&gt;.....and [the Treaty of Lisbon allows for the President of the Commission and the President of the Council to be one and the same person](http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/europeancouncil_en.htm#PRESIDENT).  No head of state of a member country is allowed to also wield the executive power of the Commission but the new President of the European Union can't be a head of state in any one member country and the council which he presides over APPOINTS the president of the commission which makes the same condition.

No head of state can currently rise to control both the administrative and executive powers of the council and commission.  The new position of EU President made by the Treaty of Lisbon, a position appointed not by the European people, however could and would preside over a new legal entity of EU personhood operating as a state outside member states.


**Short answer:**  What does it mean for the people of Europe?  It creates a larger more powerful legal entity but one that is much less representative with fewer checks and balances on those that wield the power.",t5_2qh13,,0,c0dz8ee,0,t3_9qh78

Although both nations are suffering from over-borrowing and over-consumption, the after effects have been different, and the reason for this is the currency these countries use.

When the crash came, investors in Iceland sold off assets and then sold off the Krona. So not only did the Icelandic economy get hit by a sell-off, but the entire nation's savings took a hit as investors fled to more secure currencies. The result of this was a massive bout of inflation at the worst possible time, which required a raise in interest rates to bring down.

Ireland, by contrast, was securely ensconced in the Euro. This meant that while investors pulled out of Ireland, the savings of ordinary people were not hit. It was the nation's borrowers, rather than its entire population, that bore the brunt of the capital flight that took place. This has meant that interest rates in Ireland have been comparatively low as no inflation has broken out.

The stats tell the story:

*Icelandic Interest rates: 8.29% (3 month govt bond)

*Icelandic Inflation: 10.8%

*Irish Interest rates: 0.75% (3 month govt bond)

Wow, what an insightful and informative argument you made there. You seem not to realize what the word dogma means. Allow me to enlighten you.

&gt;Dogma is the established belief or doctrine held by a religion, ideology or any kind of organization: it is authoritative and not to be disputed, doubted or diverged from

As I have said, if you don't believe the dogma you aren't part of the religion. I have already shown quite a lot of objective proof that Hitler did not believe christian dogma. Hitler was not a christian.

I have noticed that your last few posts have been nothing but the repetition of the same two arguments over and over again. It seems an almost republican-like attempt to convince, not on the strength of the argument, but on the number of times it is repeated. I have already refuted these arguments but just to make some reiterations of my own.

&gt; Hitler was a member of a church

So was almost 100% of the population of Europe in the early 20'th century, including atheists and agnostics. It means nothing.

&gt;Hitler professed belief in jesus christ

Yes in public speeches, to large crowds of christians, and when it was politically advantageous Hitler claimed to be a christian. Hitler also claimed in public speeches that he wouldn't invade Poland and that the jewish population of Germany would be allowed to leave peacefully. Now you can claim that even though he lied so much in his speeches, when he talked about his faith Hitler was telling the truth; but that is really more of a subjective argument.

If you have any actually convincing evidence that Hitler was a christian please do respond and we can discuss it further. If not you can still post a response rehashing those same two arguments, I'll let you have the last word.

And sorry, but I'm profoundly uninterested in "" the gender of parents is not correlated at all with the success of children"", what I'm talking about is much deeper than simple material success.

Western societies are in a cultural crisis and I'm simply looking for ways to do something about it. Look if it wasn't us but say a triben somewhere in the Amazonas, if you'd be an anthropologist studying that culture, what would make of the following facts (I think these are more or less facts for all developed nations now):

- the disappearance of culture as such i.e. a commonly-sanctioned way of living tha represents the essence of that culture and the replacing of it with mere individual preference and/or identity groups i.e. subcultures?

- hating own traditions, considering them oppressive etc. (""dead white men"") while being open-minded about every other kind of tradition (""multiculture"")?

- that they look after the poor and the weak but expect almost nothing in return, abusing the goodwill of other people is tacitly tolerated?

- success is seen as something suspicious, the tacit assumption that being successful is participation in social injustice?

- where almost everything is seen as oppression, first just aristocratic privilege, then wealth, then custom and religion, then even scientific truth itself (postmoderns)?

- the words ""greatness"" and ""excellence"" has lost almost any meaning?

- obsessive dwelling on questions of privilige by many intellectuals, which seen from a distance is clearly the sign of small and insecure minds? 

- an observable problem of destructive short-termism, high time preferences or lack of ""delayed gratification"", exhibiting itself as social pathologies in case of the poor, idiotic loan-taking amongst the middle, idiotic loan-giving and general greed amongst the rich?

- perhaps the biggest problem, the loss of meaning and purpose in life, that people are no longer provided with a place at society and a purpose to live for at birth, leading to an epidemic of depression (age of Prozac) and so on?

I think you'd predict these are the symptoms of a dying civilization, plain simply because that civilization doesn't have a culture anymore, as culture means there are certain values, meaning lifestyles, aeshtetic values, statements consider moral truths etc. widely shared by almost everyone which gives a place and purpose in life, gives a guidance in almost everything from arts to finding a partner, and having the values shared gets people close to each other emotionally, that they aren't total strangers to each other. This is largely what culture means.

I think the core problem is too big egos, being unable to see anything but ourselves as central thing in our lives, in other words, the loss of humility as a virtue.

Europe and Northern America have developed an anti-culture, a lack of culture, and as a consequence will probably go down the drain.


If there is any hope in having again a culture where life isn't so brually alienated, aimless, hopeless and enervated peppered with occasional eruptions of brutal violence, culture itself, the concept of culture itself must be rebuilt.

There are many conservatives who sensed something similar but they committed a huge mistake: they accepted the language of liberalism and extended it, like ""do whatever you want"", extension: ""except for"": drugs, gay marriage, 50 years ago: except for obscene literature, The Pill etc., 100 years ago: except for blasphemy etc. etc.

It didn't work, they lost one battle after the other and got regarded by the urban (cultureless) population as oppressive bastards because of this negative, ""except for"" attitude. If the general rule is liberalism i.e. values derived from personal preferences, then any attempt to try to set up limits for it will be seen as oppressive, negative, arbitrary and unfriendly. Their crucial mistake was accepting liberalism as a general rule and only making exceptions to it.

So I see no other possible solution but instead of setting up limits to freedom and saying within my limits live according to the liberal principle, live according to your preferences, doing away with the whole liberal principle of values = personal preferences, and instead find a new way of culture-building politics that isn't based on negative limits, banning this or banning that, but is rather positive: a politics that says there is a good way to live which we should follow, there is a positive way of valuing things and living our lives that leads to a well-functioning culture and community, gives a purpose and place in life and gives much satisfaction in the long run, of course it requires sacrificing some ego in the short run i.e. giving up many preferences and accepting preferences that aren't our own.

Now, there are three ways to do it. 

One is the usual heavy-handed conservative politics, bans, police etc. This would either look crazy or fascist or both - f.e. a suggestion to fine everybody who isn't married by 25 would be seen as something too oppressive even by me and would be seen as totally fascist by almost everybody. After all I'm not proposing to totally give up the ideal of freedom, merely to reconcile it with other values.

Another is the libertarian way: do away with the state and hope that a purely free market would actually lead to the rebirth of culture. If it could happen it probably would be true to some extent, but this is an utopia, this will never happen.

The third way I can imagine is this one proposed here, a reconciliation of freedom with culture-buildng incentives: everything is allowed but not everything is financed from the public purse.

I simply see no other ways. You are right with the stuff about incentives often backfiring, but are there are any other ways? 

""So what is the real motivation to encourage heterosexual relationships?"" - I wouldn't dwell too much on the details. I'm suspicious about them for some reasons (fostering without blood ties may for less of a close bond, how to teach hetero role models to kids, less stable, rarely something lifelong etc.) but it's fundamental misunderstanding that I'm against something. That doesn't work. I want to stop the negative conservative policy about being against a thousand and one unconventional lifestyles and instead I want to be _for_ _one_ well-working conventional one as a positive example to be followed.

I'm _for_ something, rebuilding culture, there is no point in nitpicking about the details as of now, the point isn't whether is X bad or not. It is finding some Y that is good and use that as positive example to be encouraged and incentivized. It's like language. There is no point in dwelling on whether language X, Y, Z are bad or not, the point is to have one language as the common language shared by everyone. 

The details of rebuilding culture as culture are irrelevant in the first step. I've even seen fairly successful attempts of it in a subcultural level in soccer supporter's clubs. Some of them are excellent tiny examples of real cultures, generally according to the following pattern 

1) being a totally devoted fan of something f.e. a team limits the ego, it means the life is centered on not the self but on something that's seen as bigger than that, which kind of opens up the shell of the self 

2) this opening up makes it possible to form a real community with the other supporters because their lives are centered in the same thing and not in themselves 

3) moral values derived from the sport (loyalty, fair play, give everything for the team but be fair to the opponent) are taken out into real life because the opening up of the self provided by the devotion to the team makes it possible to ""engrave it to the heart"" i.e. to consider them as something much more than a preference

In short an almost example of what a culture is supposed to be. Of course soccer wouldn't work on the level of the whole society. I suggest work, family, community because that's tested. I'm open to other suggestions. Some sort of a science-religion for example or anything.

(To be fair I've seen soccer culture backfire exactly the same ways traditional ways of culture-building can backfire: sometimes violence erupted with the fans of other clubs (parallel: nationalistic wars, religious persecution) and in some extreme cases in degenerated into a neo-nazi style hate culture.

I think actually that was the main reason liberalism won - many people considered the cost of backfired attempts of culture building aka wars, persecutions etc. too high and kinda decided it's better not to have a culture at all. I think it would be a good time to reconsider that - perhaps if reasonably safe ways of culture-building would work better than no culture etc.)",t5_2qn9g,,0,c0dzlfd,0,t3_9pwky

&gt;They can write programs but only if told what to do because despite being a country full of traders, they lack business knowledge. If we try to train them, they never stay long enough to be useful and have difficulties working elsewhere in Europe.

Despite this claim, companies like Cisco Intel Microsoft SAP Oracle HP Adobe etc etc employ more people in India than Britain or in fact most of europe combined. In fact many of these companies employ more people in India than any other nation outside countries where these firms were incorporated.

&gt;Indians that have settled, particularly second generation or later are fine. They integrate better whether as workers or bosses and whilst they love to visit India, they no longer feel part of it.

I know they are doing fine, and i hope they stay where they are as long as possible.

&gt;Come back when you have fixed the roads

I can show you six lane express way on the side of which my residence is located, but that is unnecessary as India does have a serious issue related to roads. There are parts like North-East which still have poor roads and but even in rest of India where roads have improved a lot but still traffic is too much. But it is to be expected in one of the most densely populated nation. And looking at how far the condition of roads have improved in last few years,  i am sure within 2-3 years the situation will also improve in North-East. Though traffic will remain.

[I think you would be happy to know that India have started the project to build 20,000 km of road on annual basis](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/economy/building-20000-km-roads-per-year-achievable-kamal-nath_416218.html)

Can you tell me when in Imperial times did the British Kingdom build that much road on annual basis ?

&gt; the electricity

If it weren't for the fact that you were sleeping under the rock, you would have known that due to NSG members deal with India we have started the project to build many next generation nuclear power reactors to satisfy electricity demand. Still that wont be enough, that is why many more projects are going on and many have been commissioned
recently. In fact not far from my residence is a project which will soon be worlds largest natural gas based power plant.

&gt;and the water

Water levels in India is severely affected by the Monsoon, which has resulted into drought and floods. But the current situation is caused by El Nino, come back to me when you have figured out how to control El-nino.

&gt;Shit, you have had 60 years to fix things, what happened?

750 x 3 is 2250 a month.  Almost 30 grand a year.  That's not that terrible for having sex 3 times a month.  I could live pretty well off that honestly.

Besides, don't most porn actresses do pornography to up their name value for stripping?  Or as a supplement to hooking?

Say they make 20 grand a year stripping, which seems low.. Idk, that's 50,000 grand a year.  Now if people are living a porn star life and wasting it on drugs, and shit they can't afford, that's just not my problem, and I can't feel that terrible.

And I don't think piracy, though watching porntube stuff isn't even piracy, is about ""intangibles"".  It's about looking for quality, spreading information, and finding value.  I know that sounds like bullshit but it's true.  A lot of people work shitty jobs for about as much money as the porn actress makes in 3 fucks.  Why should they drop all their money on the glut of poor product that is out there with the rising costs of food and everything else?

There are a few girls I follow, and some styles of porn I enjoy, but  most movies are 4 or 5 girls I'm not that into and one girl I like.  And then she gets paired with a guy who can't shoot a load, has a flaccid cock, or looks like a hobo beat him up.  Where is the quality?  And if it's not that it's some stupid fucking scenario with a guys dick through a pizza, or some fake white husband licking cum out of her pussy because a black guy jizzed in it?  Wtf?

I've never seen the quality of porn in America that Private brings to the table in Europe.  Just saying.

Anyway, my point is, America has changed.  We're not the land of plenty anymore.  Hell, I just read that California is circling the drain as a failed state.  Why should porn be any different?  Everybody is cutting back and there is no use blaming a lack of porn activity on technology or the internet.

I have no idea how it is to run a porn business.

Yes; I answered elsewhere about this since you brought up this with redreplicant as well.  Saying that 300 years of history do not exist is already a bit of a simplification; saying that the guilt is all in Christianity is even more.

In short, the reason of this big downturn in (Western) prosperity was that the main drive of cultural and economic development, the Roman Empire, had fallen apart.  Notice that the same cannot be said about the Eastern Roman Empire, which was Christian in the same way but was prospering in the same period of time when in the West we were not doing so well.

Maybe the same would have happened in case of a nuclear war between US and USSR.  Who knows.  Plenty of sci-fi on the topic.

&gt; Which moral teachings are revolutionary?

To cite just one example, the Sermon on the Mount. (From Wikipedia, which I'll cite because I don't know the terminology in English as it's not my native language: _The best-known written portions of the open-air sermon comprise the Beatitudes, found at the beginning of the section. The sermon also contains the Lord's Prayer and the injunctions to ""resist not evil"" (5:39) and ""turn the other cheek"", as well as Jesus' version of the Golden Rule._)

Here's my lifestory: I grew in Belgium went to free but highly recommended schools. Got to university, which costed me about 400 € in entrance fee.  After uni i had some fun years, didnt do all too much, had some irregular jobs but hey, minimum wage in Belgium is 8 € an hour so it was kinda ok.  Now i'm working a full time job, i think i pay too much taxes, but seeing at the great education, healthcare and social safety net we have, I can live with it.

Our political system is filled with normal people who live in suburbs just like me. Our last prime minister had two goats and loves to go watch cycling on Sunday.  Theres few lobbying, most of my discomfort with out political system is very hard to explain to non Belgians, but we have been reforming our country for 50 years and we will continue along that road. We are an open society which is probably excessively tolerant toward new cultures flooding our country.  They are given access to our schools schools and persuaded to learn our language to get a job. Most countries would call us insane in the way we treat foreigners.

Considering media, we are one of the few truely lucky countries in the world where our public broadcasts are not allowed to advertise and get all their money from the taxpayer.  Which means our coverage of the politcal and social events is very neutral, uninfluenced by political viewpoints or big companies.  We dont have to pay for cable, our government considered they had been taxing ppl for 50 years and that by now the people had payed off the initial investments.  Cables are used by a lot of commercial companies these days, so theres plenty of revenue to give every belgian free cable access.

I smoke weed from time to time, which isnt hard to get by in Belgium. Our police force is given the lowest priority to personal cannabis use.  Anything below 5 grams will not get you any problems, it might be confiscated but you wont get fined, you dont need to see a judge, you wont have a criminal record.  

mm, some of the things that do 'annoy' me:
*Excessive high internet prices
*A politcal system which needs reform to mirror the dual country state that belgium is (i cant vote for half my governement, nor can the french part of belgium vote for dutch speaking representatives)
*Social welfare is a bit too easy on people not getting a job, the difference between working half time (24h = 800 euro a month) and living off welfare (about 600 euro) is too small

Actually I love my country, if theres any other country i would want to live its the Netherlands. I dont thinks theres many countries which are better off.

The real problem with America, to me, is that you believe so strongly in capitalism and free markets that you've broken the system. Any man who does a useful job for a day deserves a hot meal and a place to stay. Money is just a token of exchange between ""labour"" and ""being looked after"". Money is a brilliant way of having freedom within this exchange but with so many companies and millionaires hoarding it., from refusing to pay out health insurance to customer lock-ins to political bribery, not to mention the base reason...the flat out greed and theft by the bankers.

It's time to give up on Capitalist bullshit, free-market economy trash, Oil companies who sell shit from the ground and the super rich who made their money in the Timber business having ringed a forest 100 years ago who make their money today selling ""their"" trees instead of their hardwork for your hardwork.

Money is a great tool but there is a balance to be preserved. A house shouldn't cost more than it costs the people to build it (inc. their holiday entitlements, pension, risk of them finding their next job), we all have to work harder to provide for those we want to support who can't support themselves. e.g. disability allowance. There is no point pretending otherwise. We all know the dangers of not having a job so we accept we all have to work harder for those down on their luck. Accept it as a fact and an ideology. Don't be a capatilist and worry about the money that's potentially slipping through your fingers, think about the benefit to your own quality of life. Houses are designed for living in. That's their purpose and we've always considered ""shelter"" to be a basic human right...so lets get rid of the spivs who buy 5 fives and rent them out in order to exchange ""property"" for ""hardwork"". The spivs who make slaves out of us. With enough technology and mass production we can reach a balance where we can work comfortably and efficiently to provide for ourselves, for our entire life.

Thomas Lifson, editor and publisher, calls himself a recovering academic. After graduating from Kenyon College, he studied Japan, sociology and business as a graduate student at Harvard (3 degrees) and joined the faculty at Harvard Business School, where he also began the consulting career that was to lead him away from academia. He also taught sociology and East Asian studies at Harvard, and held visiting professorships at Columbia University and the Japanese National Museum of Ethnology. As a consultant, he has worked with major companies from the United States, Japan, Europe, and Australia at the nexus of human, organizational, and strategic issues.

A Democrat by birth, he became more conservative in adulthood as reality taught him that dreams of perfecting human society always run smack into human nature.

In 2003 he founded American Thinker. He appears frequently on the Dennis Miller radio show, as well as other talk radio programs. 

Richard Baehr, chief political correspondent, is a management consultant in the health care field, and is the president of Richard A. Baehr &amp; Associates. He frequently serves as an expert witness in healthcare litigation cases involving planning and financial matters. Richard has had a long interest in the Middle East, and American politics, and is a frequent speaker and writer on these subjects. He has spoken at many Jewish organization meetings, synagogues, and colleges on various topics: Israeli-Palestinian relations, the war in Lebanon, American politics and Israel, the future of Israel and the Middle East, and American political trends.

Richard was recently named a Visiting Fellow of the Jewish Policy Center, and was a panelist for a Jewish Policy Center Forum along with Michael Medved, John Podhoretz and David Horowitz. He has been a guest on many talk radio programs including those of Michael Medved, Dennis Miller and Milt Rosenberg. Richard also writes a commentary on the Middle East and American politics which is distributed by email. Richard is a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Kenyon College. He is married with two adult children.

Ed Lasky, news editor, is a former lawyer, and now a stock trader. Northwestern University, B.A. economics, University of Michigan Law School-J.D., Master of Management, J. L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management (Northwestern University).

A read-aholic husband of one and  father of three wonderful kids (twin girls, and a son), Ed is focused on politics, media monitoring, and foreign affairs. He started being concerned about the future when he had children. 9/11 was a motivating factor, as well. He feels fortunate to live in America

Ed has appeared on the Milt Rosenberg show in Chicago and a variety of other radio shows (including National Public Radio); has been mentioned in Newsweek and interviewed  by the NY Times. Recently he appeared on the O'Reilly Factor on Fox News.

Rick Moran is a professional writer/editor living in Streator, IL. He is a contributor to American Thinker as well as being its associate editor. He is also Chicago editor of Pajamas Media and is proprietor of the website Right Wing Nuthouse.

Larrey Anderson, submissions editor, is a writer and philosopher. He studied comparative religion, philosophy, and law at Harvard, Penn State, and Catholic University of America. He served three terms as an Idaho state senator including a stint as chairman of the Health and Welfare Committee. He retired from the senate for health reasons. He has written four books. 

He lives on the Snake River in Idaho with his wife (sometime AT contributor Eileen McDevitt) and their three Irish Water Spaniels. Larrey and Eileen have two children and three (soon to be four) grandchildren.

Marc Sheppard, environment editor, is a senior partner in a technology consultation and software development firm on Long Island, where he lives with this wife and three children. A healed former liberal, he swapped his subscription to Rolling Stone for National Review over 20 years ago.   Now an unrepentant skeptic, he writes commentary on culture, media, education and politics, with a watchful eye on their ideological hijacking through the misrepresentation of science and technology.

I don't know, as I said I'm weak on this.  But St. Anselm was the greatest philosopher of the time, maybe he didn't really have competitors.

Regarding Theodosius, the emperors at the time were not a dynasty, they were just generals who managed to be ""elected"" by the military.  After the East/West Roman Empire split the wealth already had moved to the East, it would make sense that the strongest generals would aim at becoming Eastern emperors rather than stay in Rome, which had already been weakened by invasions from the North.

the root of Iceland's problems that have now decimated its economy appear to have started when the government decided to privatise the banks in the early 1990s.

""Iceland got its regulations from the EU, which was basically sound,"" he says. ""But the government had no understanding of the dangers of banks or how to supervise them. They got into the hands of people who took risks to the highest possible degree."" 

Kaupthing's loan book, which was leaked on to the internet last week, shows that around one third, or €6bn (£5.1bn), of its €16bn corporate loan book was going to a small elite of men connected to the bank's owners and management.

Several investigations into Kaupthing centre on share ramping, where the bank would allegedly give loans with no interest or security in order to buy shares in that same bank – boosting the share price. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/6034654/Iceland-what-ugly-secrets-are-waiting-to-be-exposed-in-the-meltdown.html

&gt;As an Icelander I don't really see why Icelanders as a nation should pay the debts of a private company.

Because it's an Icelandic company and you agreed to certain banking rules in order to let that private company be able to do international business. And don't forget that the Icelandic economy hugely profited from the bubble you profited too, indirectly, because of the extra tax revenue for Iceland. 

&gt;Regulations were bad, not only here but also in Europe

Yes that's why the American saved AIG, with tax money. The Dutch saved Fortis/ABN Amro, with tax money. The British saved Barclays, with tax money. If they hadn't done this the entire world economy would be in the shitter and Iceland would be even more screwed so now you're just being selfish. 

&gt;The Icelandic government got no tax revenue from these Icesave accounts

Yes they did, they tax the company so they taxed the extra profits that the accounts generated.

Well by the right and the centre mostly as a bunch of assholes that try to weasel themselves out paying, and the left more the 'feel sorry for the average Icelander etc.' sentiment.

&gt;I've not heard any sensible arguments against repaying

Well me neither but I've heard a lot of ridiculous arguments if I read sites like Icelandwheatherreport and other English language Icelandic sites most of the people feel they shouldn't pay anything, but maybe I'm wrong to extrapolate that to the rest of Icelanders. 

&gt;but we're annoyed that the guys who screwed the system (with support of the governing political party, I might add) are now sitting on mountains of cash, having played the rules so as to leave their bankrupt firms stripped of assets with the aid of loans which then weren't repaid (adding to the value loss of the kaput banks).

So why don't you protest more? All the photos of protests I've been seeing show pathetic little protests with 2000 people max. While Iceland, because of it's size, should be perfect for a more direct democracy and demonstrations that are effective etc.
Although an apathetic attitude is the most common here too and sadly in most of Europe.

Only the market can minimize this.  Getting the government involved to ""fix"" whatever problems you see will not have the effects that you intend.  This is because the government decides based not on profits and losses, but on bureaucracy.  Decisions based on profit and loss are ""better"" than decisions based on bureaucracy.

For some reason you have this self-righteous agenda that money is ""wasted"" when it is paid as bonuses.  Such agendas fails to understand that bonuses are what keeps good talents to not go elsewhere.  Now, you can pretend to yourself that these people are not all they are cracked up to be, if that makes you feel any better, but in the real world and in the world of honesty and justice the fact is that these people *do* have talents and their rewards are justified.

It is the height of irony that Keynesian intellectuals ever chastise these large bonuses.  For what is missed in the hubris and agendas is that Keynesians explicitly place a double standard on spending money.  

When the government spends money, we are to take this as being beneficial to the economy because consumption is ""good"" and ""drives the economy"", and sets in motion the ""multiplier effect"" that allegedly ripples throughout the economy, raising profits and supposedly increasing employment.  By the same token, we are told that saving money is not a good thing because it is a ""leakage"" that exits the spending stream and hence ""lowers incomes"" and thus allegedly raises unemployment.  

Many Keynesians even say that it is better that the government take money away from business by force, because if they didn't then business will ""hoard"" the cash and not pay salaries or wages.

Now, contrast this all with senior salary earners in a company.  Whey they are given bonuses, do they not spend this money in the economy?  Does this spending not put in motion all the beneficial effects that Keynesians say will better the economy?  Aren't bonuses ""spent"" on the bonus receiver's consumption?  Does this spending not set in motion ""multiplier effects""?  Does this spending not raise profits of companies and thus allegedly raise employment?

For obvious reasons, Keynesians cannot be consistent in what they say.  They don't attribute to executive spending what they attribute to government spending, as consumption spending does not set in motion the beneficial things that are supposed to be set in motion if the wrong people spend their money, as if the dollars being spent have a mind of their own and ""know"" who spent the money and thus magically cease producing all the beneficial effects from spending that Keynesians tell us is so important.

&gt;rewarding someone for a job well done seems to work fairly well, pay should be commensurate with success. rewarding failure, just whose idea is that anyway?

Ah, but can't you see?  Rewarding a job well done and punishing failure are decisions made if the decisions are subject to profit and loss.  The whole point of making decisions based on bureaucracy is precisely going against profit and loss and rewarding and punishing people based on bureaucracy instead, which means people who fucked up in the market will get rewarded because they have political clout but those who do a good job are punished because they do not have political clout.

Can't you see that by calling for the government to overrule and override business capital decisions will result in *exactly* the very society that you know is unjust and immoral?  Remember, the only reason, the only way that decisions can sweep away and ignore profit and loss as a litmus test for basing decisions is if and only if there is physical force present which prevent the effects of deciding against profit and loss from becoming manifest.  The only institution in society that can use physical force is the government.  Thus only the government can result in widespread decisions where good work is punished and bad work is rewarded.

Look at the bailouts of Wall Street.  Do you honestly think that all these bad decisions could have been rewarded in the absence of government intervention forcing bad decisions to be rewarded?  The bailouts were based on initiating physical force against the taxpayer.  The inflation from the Federal Reserve were based on physical force being initiated against everyone forcing them to use the dollars that the Fed prints and thus become trapped in the system and thus become victims of inflation.

&gt;is there any proof that American execs are worth ten, twenty more times than an exec in Japan, Germany?

I thought you said you didn't want equality?  The Federal Reserve is printing money multiples of times faster than the central bank in Europe or Japan are printing money.  Printing money goes to the financial sector first before it goes everywhere else.  Remember, the Federal Reserve is only in existence to benefit the bankers.  It is not to benefit the economy.  The Federal Reserve is the US banking cartel's method of protecting their cartel through government guns.  That's all it is.  Of COURSE massive printing will result in massive bank profits and thus bonuses.  In a free market this would not take place.  In a free market in money production, you will see lower bonuses because ALL money would have to be earned by working hard, and not just by being lucky on where you are in the lineup to the money printer.",t5_2qh1s,,0,c0e008w,0,t3_9puja

In case of Icelandic government erasing debts, that is a real possibility. The Icelandic government accepted to pay up to Britain and Netherlands put with few conditions, these conditions were quite acceptable but both government in Britain and Netherlands have chosen to this not accept these conditions and make deal with the Icelandic government. What they are doing is blackmailing, unless a deal is brokered an IMF organized loan to Iceland is not given, that largely comes from the Nordic countries, and if there is no deal then the British and Netherlander governments will block the Icelandic ascension to the European Union.

Today he and Gerrard hardly got good service from Lucas and Mascherano who had to fight 2vs4 on the central midfield (more or less), this was Rafa's fault.

But just to go through... Drogba has played one African Cup of nations final which he lost, he failed to score, he even missed his penalty in the penalty shoot out. Torres won the European Championship with his goal.

In the Champions League knock-out stage Drogba has scored 9 goals in 26 games. Torres 5 goals in 10 games (one goal in every tie he's played). If you look at overall game to goal ratio at Chelsea vs. Liverpool, Torres again comes up on top.

How about goals in international competitions?
Drogba at the World Cup: 2 games 1 goal. Torres at the World Cup: 4 games 3 goals. The only place Drogba has better stats than Torres is goals in the the CAN/EUROs 7 goals in 11 vs 2 goals in 8. (Torres also has 3 goals in 5  the Confed Cup)

He wasn't perfect at all, but his accomplishments are unsurpassed and he truly had the working mans interest at heart while also managing US through the great depression and WW2. How much more kickass could you be, oh yea you could have overcome crippling polio, depression and alcoholism to rise to the needs of a poverty stricken middle class. Lincoln is 2nd and a fairly distant second I think. Lincoln did well with harsh times, but he wasn't leading the cause of abolitionism he merely took the opinion of the side with the most votes and money, while owning slaves himself. 
He preserved the Union and was murdered for his efforts, but FDR truly united the nation in a way that hasn't happened since. This is why the working class of America, liberal or conservative should be working together to overcome the oppression of corporations and an out of control wealth gap rather than using them as cornerstones of their political campaigns.  There is hardly a time in US history I can see where Americans we more unified and not because of WW2 at all, because of poverty and rampant abuse at the hands of the wealthy.

Obama, as much as we needed him to be and as much as I would like him to be is simply no FDR. He does not have the strength of character or the ability to unify and sadly that is one great downfall of appealing to minorities, the divisive force of racism is overwhelming. It may sound bad to say, but we needed a white Obama, a man with Obama's integrity and views on civil liberties and workers rights, but without the divisive side of fueling American racism. In the big picture he will do well and help dissolve some US racism, but right now we need major change and reform which is impossible to achieve at the hands of a black President. Not as any fault of his own, but as a fault of the American public and it's long battle with racism. Not just against blacks, but against every minority that has ever come to America; Irish, Italian, Hispanics, Asians, even Europeans in general should fear US racism and how can that be when we ourselves are clearly of a majority of European decent. It's embarrassing, but fixing moral issues like this via legislation takes centuries if ever possible. We need fiscal reform, we need the higher taxes on the rich we've had for much of American history and clearly through our most prosperous times we've kept the rich in check. Every time we allowed them to prosper at too great a rate they screw the nation over. Today's low taxes on the rich are only matched by the low taxes of 1920's and it's no coincidence granting that excessive power to the rich is followed by recessions, depressions and banking failures.  By granting them too low of a tax burden and therefore putting a higher burden on the middle class is a form of oppression which destroys US productivity and moral.

We are taking food from out own mouths to feed the rich, the people who have the most and need the least. That is entirely incompatible with the basics of capitalism, supply and demand and the 'land of opportunity'. We have transformed the US into the land of the opportunistic instead; taking opportunity from the hands of the middle class and killing US innovation and industry. 

Real conservatives support anti-monopoly laws and market protections and since Reagan we've been sold out by right wing radicals who've aligned themselves with religion and wealth in order to hi-jack our democracy. Reagan, a man who was a democrat most of his life, and an actor, not a man of great achievement, was a puppet bought and paid for by the wealthy to sell our democracy to the highest bidder. Not that it was perfect before, but conservatives used to be concerned with the integrity of the constitution and democracy itself and they therefore had to stand against big business and big spending rather than being entirely sponsored by it as they are today.

These people are not conservatives, by the definition and example of conservatism. They are not even Neo-cons, they are a party of corporate loyalists who have willingly or unknowingly helped transform the US toward fascism by fueling it's main component, corporatism.

Over his decades as a columnist, lecturer, TV host and debater, William F. Buckley Jr. lost his cool in public only once -- when he threatened to sock Gore Vidal ""in your goddamn face"" on the third night of their joint appearances on ABC during the ill-fated 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Three nights on a television set with Vidal might drive anyone mad, yet Buckley also tangled with the roughest players on the left, from Jesse Jackson to William Kunstler, with unfailing composure. 

This Story
Is Conservatism Brain-Dead?
Rethinking Capitalism: How Very Enterprising
But suppose that instead of his formal addresses and his weekly ""Firing Line"" show on PBS, Buckley had hosted a talk radio show 15 hours a week for 20 years, or hosted a nightly hour-long cable news show, sliced into six-minute segments. One can imagine him archly sniffing: ""You can't possibly immanentize the eschaton in six minutes!"" But one can also imagine him overexposed, spread thin chasing the issue of the moment and perhaps losing his temper now and then -- in short, less the man of style and ideas who inspired two generations of conservative thinkers and more just a populist shock jock with a funny prep-school accent. 

During the glory days of the conservative movement, from its ascent in the 1960s and '70s to its success in Ronald Reagan's era, there was a balance between the intellectuals, such as Buckley and Milton Friedman, and the activists, such as Phyllis Schlafly and Paul Weyrich, the leader of the New Right. The conservative political movement, for all its infighting, has always drawn deeply from the conservative intellectual movement, and this mix of populism and elitism troubled neither side. 

Today, however, the conservative movement has been thrown off balance, with the populists dominating and the intellectuals retreating and struggling to come up with new ideas. The leading conservative figures of our time are now drawn from mass media, from talk radio and cable news. We've traded in Buckley for Beck, Kristol for Coulter, and conservatism has been reduced to sound bites. 


President Obama has done conservatives a great favor, delivering CPR to the movement with his program of government gigantism, but this resuscitation should not be confused with a return to political or intellectual health. The brain waves of the American right continue to be erratic, when they are not flat-lining. 

Consider the ""tea party"" phenomenon. Though authentic and laudatory, it is unfocused, lacking the connection to a concrete ideology that characterized the tax revolt of the 1970s, which was joined at the hip with insurgent supply-side economics. Meanwhile, the ""birthers"" have become the ""grassy knollers"" of the right; their obsession with Obama's origins is reviving frivolous paranoia as the face of conservatism. (Does anyone really think that if evidence existed of Obama's putative foreign birth, Hillary Rodham Clinton wouldn't have found it 18 months ago?) 

The best-selling conservative books these days tend to be red-meat titles such as Michelle Malkin's ""Culture of Corruption,"" Glenn Beck's new ""Arguing with Idiots"" and all of Ann Coulter's well-calculated provocations that the left falls for like Pavlov's dogs. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with these books. Politics is not conducted by Socratic seminar, and Henry Adams's dictum that politics is the systematic organization of hatreds should remind us that partisan passions are an essential and necessary function of democratic life. The right has always produced, and always will produce, potboilers. 

Conspicuously missing, however, are the intellectual works. The bestseller list used to be crowded with the likes of Friedman's ""Free to Choose,"" George Gilder's ""Wealth and Poverty,"" Paul Johnson's ""Modern Times,"" Allan Bloom's ""The Closing of the American Mind,"" Charles Murray's ""Losing Ground"" and ""The Bell Curve,"" and Francis Fukuyama's ""The End of History and the Last Man."" There are still conservative intellectuals attempting to produce important work, but some publishers have been cutting back on serious conservative titles because they don't sell. (I have my own entry in the list: a two-volume political history titled ""The Age of Reagan."" But I never expected the books to sell well; at 750 pages each, you can hurt yourself picking them up.) 

About the only recent successful title that harkens back to the older intellectual style is Jonah Goldberg's ""Liberal Fascism,"" which argues that modern liberalism has much more in common with European fascism than conservatism has ever had. But because it deployed the incendiary f-word, the book was perceived as a mood-of-the-moment populist work, even though I predict that it will have a long shelf life as a serious work. Had Goldberg called the book ""Aspects of Illiberal Policymaking: 1914 to the Present,"" it might have been received differently by its critics. And sold about 200 copies. 

Of course, it's hard to say whether conservative intellectuals are simply out of interesting ideas or if the reading public simply finds their ideas boring. Both possibilities (and they are not mutually exclusive) should prompt some self-criticism on the right. Conservatism has prospered most when its attacks on liberalism have combined serious alternative ideas with populist enthusiasm. When the ideas are absent, the movement has nothing to offer -- except opposition. That doesn't work for long in American politics. 

The late Irving Kristol, who appeared on TV about as often as a solar eclipse, spoke to this point when he remarked that even though Sen. Joe McCarthy may have been a ""vulgar demagogue,"" at least the public understood that he was anti-Communist. ""They know no such thing,"" Kristol said, about liberals. 

Yet it was not enough just to expose liberalism's weakness; it was also necessary to offer robust alternatives for both foreign and domestic policy, ideas that came to fruition in the Reagan years. Today, it is not clear that conservative thinkers have compelling alternatives to Obama's economic or foreign policy. At best, the right is badly divided over how to fix the economy and handle Iran and Afghanistan. So for the time being, the populists alone have the spotlight.

Keep telling yourself America is great rah-rah-rah.

The reason America is a world ecomic power has to do with decades of imperialism and what used to be a large base of natural wealth and industrial base which in turn was used to develop a successful financial industry.

The American government NEVER stayed out of the way. In the 1800s it actively supported the robber barons of its time, in the early 1900s it implemented the first instances of a welfare state and actively intervened to promote its industrial base, and favoring some of the interest of unions which substantially increased the standard of living of the working class during that time. In WWII it supported the war machine actively and incurred massive debt to keep industries working, and intervened once again in the reconstruction of Europe, while defending its economic interests abroad through military might. 

And let's not even talk about American interventionist policy during the Cold War, from actively funding the military-industrial complex, and promoting destabilization of governments abroad that did not favor American businesses.

When 20% of a population has a representation of 40%, that's not under-represented. This was the situation in my courses, and since you weren't there, don't you dare say they were under-represented. I know it's hearsay, but it's something that I can't prove to you. This actually leads me into the only real rant I'll have where I'll remove the hat of civility... Affirmative action is the largest piece of bird shit that a donkey has ever eaten. Ok, hat back on. What it does is decrease standards to meet percentages. With decreased standards, there are people getting degrees that should have failed out. Having worked with some of these people in the real world, they're worthless and dilute the meaning of certain degrees. If you want equality, then hold everybody to the same standard of excellence. Don't just write off minorities as special and give them some candy because you think they're stupid and disadvantaged. There're plenty of scholarships out there for whatever you can think of; found one for left-handed women when searching in highschool. Cutting a break on finances is a far cry from making them work less to attain the same goal.

With the minority college students screwing me over, perhaps I was too vague. At my university, they were technically enrolled in the minority college, but pursued whatever degree they wanted to, with lower standards. We had the same courses; they were studying for the same degree; we had to work together often. They just happened to be exempted from the high standards everyone else had to uphold, and would not work on team projects, presentations, etc. The degrees were being handed to them with little effort, and they would constantly flaunt it in our faces. One of my friends from Nigeria got really pissed at them. He hated how everyone thought he was in the ""college of lower standards"" because he was black, but didn't qualify because he was ""african american"". He didn't understand why people were getting the easy path through life when he busted his ass far harder than I did to get there.

Foreigners have trouble because the various systems don't directly correlate. A russian friend of mine is completing her masters now, but had to jump through more hoops than a bengal tiger just to get an adviser to examine the courses and see which qualified for which courses. She had to take a couple extra semesters because the official translation used (went back and forth between the language through several ""official translations"" before it was classified as really official) didn't properly explain the course that was taken. That was the problem, and a student visa, but the actual coursework and grades, same stuff we put up with. The hassle is what reduces the acceptance rate; it just turns them away.

I tested out of all the ""liberal artsy"" and core courses prior to entering college. I just had to take an elective or two. All I studied in college was engineering. I didn't have the fluff you're speaking of.

Me saying blacks are one type of person would be an insult to my friends and blacks in general. The people throwing around the word are the same ones who are at the forefront of making sure nobody else uses it. The ones really hurt and upset by it aren't the ones you see on tv.

It's also not the majority either that see the flag as a symbol for hatred. Assuming ""everybody"" thinks a certain way is very problematic. If you engaged in conversation with people from all over the place, you'd be surprised in what you'd find. I've had asians and europeans see it and go ""flag of the south"" as well as europeans say ""don't people think that's some kind of hate flag?"" You'll find that many of those who harbor no ill feelings to the flag generally don't say anything because the loudest members of the crowd start yelling first. There's usually no civil discussion, just a shouting match.

You strongly see the flag as nothing more than a hate flag, and I'm just trying to inform you that it's not. Flying the flag will give people both the wrong and right idea. That's just how things happen. Plaster a sticker saying ""BOB"" on the back of a car and you'll get people thinking there's a baby in the car, or they're just named bob. Everybody interprets something a different way; it's human nature. There are far more people who don't see the rebel flag as a flag of hate than you probably imagine. I understand that many do see it as a hate flag, and they just have to live with the fact that there are many of us who don't.",t5_2qzb6,,0,c0e0c7b,0,t3_9qmxi

Gracias a eso, hoy, Cemex lucha por permanecer con vida y se ha visto este año a días de desaparecer. Todo esto causado por la deuda.

El indicador de confianza se pudo haber conseguido con una emisión más pequeña, o con algun otro instrumento que detonara la calificación de Moody's (que por cierto, si escuchas los debates que están teniendo en Estados Unidos sobre reformas financieras, te darás cuenta que esas ""calificaciones"" deben traer un ""caveat emptor"", y por tanto realmente no indican nada).

La confianza, por cierto, está basada en la capacidad de producir retornos futuros. ESO es lo que la hace grande. Si hoy nadie compraría deuda por 50 MDD míos, es por que no he podido probar que produciré esos retornos. Lo mismo de podría decir de Sergei Brin, creador de Google, a mi edad.

Not really.  European royalty was certainly big on marrying first cousins which is arguably incestuous but does not fall under the rubric of the universal incest taboo since many societies have condoned it throughout history.  However, European royalty was never big on fathers and brothers marrying sisters and mothers and from an anthropological perspective, that's what the incest taboo refers to.  

As for your assessment of the murder taboo, we can't really have a conversation about it unless we agree that virtually all cultures we know of  recognize a fundamental difference between murder and warfare.  *You* may not recognize the difference in your own life, but one of the basic tenets of anthropology is that you can't apply your own values to other cultures when seeking to understand them objectively, and in this case what that means is that there is an almost universally acknowledged difference between murder and warfare.

All governments are corporations, your citizenship is not about which country you belong to, your citizenship is about which corporation you belong to, you can always hand it back and become your own sovereign again, just like the day you were born before your mother/father got you a birth certificate and registered you as a member (stock) of the corporation, if this is done properly you will not be subject to the corporations bylaws and statutes anymore and will obtain sovereign immunity from the corporation. A corporation being a fictional identity cannot enter into a contract with a flesh and blood being (sovereign), the only way you participate in the corporation is through a straw man identity which is the fictional you as created through your birth certificate and similar instruments and identified through the capitol letters use of your name.

We can take them on and win, but most people don't get the charade and unless everyone gets up or lays down at the same time its a futile effort.

The first problem is with the criminal governments Americans keep electing using a two party ""Punch and Judy"" puppet show political system, without anybody understanding whats going on behind the back curtain. I cant understand why people elect representatives who have a greater alliance to a party than to the people who elected them. Presidents are selected behind closed doors and not elected, you don't choose your president, you choose between 2 people not even chosen by you who are portrayed as being different when the same agenda continues no matter who you vote for, People need to start voting independents only if they want to claim back the government. The current political system is designed to allow the continuation of America as the foreign Military Corporation of the New World Order group. YOU MUST VOTE INDEPENDENT'S ONLY, THIS IS THE FIRST STEP, ONCE YOU HAVE ENOUGH IN CONGRESS YOU CAN CHANGE THE REST FROM WITHIN.

The next problem is the main stream media (And that is not just the American media - but they are the worse) that promotes propaganda constantly, everything seams now to be nothing but a spin job to move the ideology of the people into what ever paddock the government wants you in on any particular issue, so many American people still just go along with it and move to that paddock. The main stream media is now just a biased government tool and not a unbiased credible news source. ( I posted on this thread when they took over it). ONCE YOU HAVE ENOUGH INDEPENDENTS IN CONGRESS YOU CAN LICENSE OUT THE BULLSHITTER'S.

Another problem is the CIA, it comes across as meaning nothing more than ""Corporate Interests Abroad"". While they claim to protect you and to keep you safe from ""Them"", the ""Them's"" are always connected with the CIA and it appears the CIA is really there only to keep them safe from ""you"". All so called terrorists groups are allowed to function as tools and assets of the CIA. The CIA does all the dirty work and the main stream media bundles it up nicely and sells it to the people based on what ever paddock they want you in to achieve what ever results they want..
ONCE YOU HAVE ENOUGH INDEPENDENTS IN CONGRESS YOU CAN WIND BACK THE FOREIGN POLICY WHICH HAS CAUSED NOTHING BUT CONCERN FOR THE WORLD (except as currently told by the main stream media)

Its known as Order out of Chaos, and the order they want now is a New World Order, whats happening now is a new shuffling of the cards to gain your acceptance, but once you accept it it will be totally different from what they are selling, it will be total control, its the process they have been using for the last 150 years and I am so glad that people are starting to wake up to it now. But once your awake you must act on the knowledge if you want to have an influence in stopping them, even at the expense of the quality of your life you must stand up and do it for your kids. It will be your generations gift to them.
ONCE YOU HAVE THE CONGRESS BACK YOU CAN ROUND THE SCUM UP AND SEND THEM BACK TO ENGLAND AND EUROPE.

That's about the same amount of time our children spend in school during the course of a year, so I think it's fair to present Obama with a report card on progress made thus far in his administration. If it makes you feel any better, consider that one-sixth of his elected term is already over.

I believe the only fair way to assess the President's progress until now is to compare what Candidate Obama promised to what President Obama has delivered. When considered in that light, I don't think he fares very well.

Let's begin with the closing of our prison at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Candidate Obama insisted that would be a priority of his administration; it even seemed in the first days of his presidency that it would be when he announced a January 2010 deadline by which the shut down was to be complete. By his own admission, the best grade Obama can be given here is an ""Incomplete."" I think he's been trying to reach his goal, but he's been forced to acknowledge the deadline he himself set won't be met. With the fate and destinations yet to be determined for over 200 detainees still remaining in Guantanamo and no long line of countries volunteering to take them in, the closing of Guantanamo is proving to be a herculean task. The best President Obama has been able to do is to get small commitments from countries like Hungary and Kuwait, each agreeing to take one. Bermuda has agreed to take four, Italy took a couple and the tiny island country of Palau has agreed to take about a dozen. Is this reminding anyone but me of the ""coalition of the willing?"" In fairness, a few European countries are expected to make announcements soon about taking a few of the detainees, but nobody expects the numbers to look much different then than they do now. At least as thorny an issue is the fact there's no American support or stomach for bringing them here either. (Some inevitably will be, if only to stand trial.)

On Iraq and Afghanistan, I'll give Obama a ""D"", with a note home that he's not applying himself. The ""D"" grade is justified because of the differences between Candidate Obama and President Obama. In fact, since taking office, he's been very Bush-like. It's true that Obama came into office obligated to a pact signed last year by the Bush administration with Iraq that included timelines for troop withdrawal, but I doubt anyone believes Obama could not have renegotiated at least part of that pact had it been his priority to do so. Let's face it - they want us to leave. It's hard to see how the Iraqis would have objected much if Obama had asked them to scrap the pact and we'd begun the process of getting out faster.

It's also difficult to see a lot of difference between Obama's and Bush's policies in Afghanistan. Does anyone think Bush would not have also been increasing the size of our presence there? The only reason this grade is a ""D"" rather than an ""F"" is because I think Obama inherited two wars nobody really knows what to do with.

Obama gets a ""C"" from me on the issue of health care reform. ""C"" students perform on an averaged level and I base this grade on the fact that both Candidate Obama's and President Obama's plans for health care have been generally diluted and attacked in the same way and by the same people that all other attempts at health care reform have met with throughout our history. But, he gets another ""does not apply himself"" note sent home too. He waited too long to get involved in the writing of the legislation; guys who don't take the extra step never get more than a ""C"".

The President gets a big fat ""F"" on the issue of ""don't ask, don't tell"" for the military. He came into office having campaigned on a promise to get rid of the policy and had the backing of both the American public and enough military advisers to get Congressional approval for doing so. President Obama hasn't shown enough effort to make good on what Candidate Obama said he would do and I see no extenuating circumstances for which to excuse him.

He earns another ""F"" for reversing as President the position of Candidate Obama regarding the prosecution of those involved during the previous administration in illegal interrogation practices. Whether you agree or disagree with his decision, it still represents a dramatic difference in policy from the one he espoused last year.

On the issues of global warming and immigration reform, I'm willing to give President Obama an ""Incomplete"" again. I think it's fair to allow him more time to begin work on both of these problems; it's not like there hasn't been plenty to deal with already. Additionally, these are both issues that promise to be at least as contentious as has been the spirited debate on health care reform. His ultimate grade will be determined by how he handles them when they do come up.

I'll put a couple of things under the heading of extra-curricular activities and will not assign them grades. These are both issues that should never have warranted presidential attention in the first place, so neither is technically a part of his job description; nor was either event foreseeable by Candidate Obama. But President Obama let personal interests override better judgment in these two instances. One was his infamous interjection of himself into the Henry Gates debacle and the other was his decision to get in the middle of making the case for Chicago to host the 2016 Olympics. Note home from coach: Barack sometimes handles the ball himself when he should pass it off.

In spite of all this, President Barack Obama still enjoys a better than 50% job performance rating (as averaged from top polls by realclearpolitics). You can find both friend and foe giving Obama higher marks on some issues than I've assigned here. You can also find those who think I was too generous. I say facts are facts, inconvenient or otherwise. To deny that and form your opinions based on party affiliation is un-American. Some of us should be dang glad we're not getting report cards ourselves.

None of what I've written here should be misconstrued to suggest I think Obama wasn't the better candidate for the Presidency last year. I shudder to think how long this eight months would have been had we ended up with a McCain/Palin administration. But I do believe in holding to the fire the feet of those who are supposed to serve us. We'll never move forward as a nation with many problems to solve until we're all willing to do so.

What's worst about people like you is that you're the ones most likely to claim to be concerned with 'original intent' and 'the Founders' when in reality *Jefferson himself* wrote that laws we no longer valid twenty years after they were passed. *All* of the Founders believed the Enlightenment idea that 'the Earth belongs in usufruct to the living', and, terrified as they were witnessing the example in the European monarchy where the public could be constrained for centuries by arbitrary convention passed above their heads, they would *never* want us today to try to constrain ourselves to their ideas.

*No one* advocates the Air Force be disbanded because we all agree that while it is not *in* the Constitution, it *is* a reasonable inference therefrom. If you had any integrity in the convictions you pretend to have, you'd advocate that it be disbanded until such a time as an actual amendment could be passed -- which, since the amendment process was made intentionally unwieldy since it was meant to account for only the most exigent changes between Conventions, would likely take months to a year or more.

The facts are (can be verified on [Wikipedia - RoHS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoHS) and other linked sources):

* Environment is less polluted now, and people will be healthier thanks to RoHS. RoHS-compliant computer waste is much more recyclable.
* In spite of fear mongering, reliability of consumer electronics has not dropped, there are no widespread equipment failures due to tin whiskers or other issues, and cost of computer electronics did not increase. ""RoHS has been in force for more than 15 months now, and ~$400B RoHS-compliant products have been produced. With all of these products in the field, no significant numbers of tin whisker-related failures have been reported"". Proportionally, it's been trillions of dollars worth of RoHS-compliant equipment by now, without significant problems.
* Unregulated and untaxed pollution goes against Economics 101. The right thing to do is either heavily tax all pollution, or issue tradable pollution permits, or set outright limits, whatever has lowest costs to manage. Not doing so means much higher pollution than economically optimal due to [externality costs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality). It's fake economics to claim that regulations are always bad, and it would get you an instant failing grade in any economics course.
* Even many permanently RoHS-exempt manufacturers switched to RoHS compliance voluntarily, now that RoHS-compliance solders got better.
* Most major manufacturers like AMD, Motorola, IBM, Apple etc. are all pro-RoHS, and none of them is complaining about RoHS or calling for its recall.
* Other sources of lead are regulated to, [for car batteries EU is trying to set up obligatory recycling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_Directive). [Leaded gasoline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetra-ethyl_lead#History), which was a huge historical mistake (increase in performance thanks to leaded gasoline are very small, alternatives were always available), was banned in all countries already, what resulted in fivefold decrease in lead concentration in blood.
* All EU environmental regulations are proceeded by [scientific assessment](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eia/home.htm), vaguely analogous to what CBO does for American budget. I won't claim that there's no politics involved, as there always is some, but these targets are not pulled out of anybody's ass, unlike most lobbyist claims.

I thought so too, but being involved in political activism recently I see (neutral and positive) media coverage as much more important. This is public attention that cannot be bought, while most people learned to ignore ads on TV and in the streets.

For example, the German pirate party was effectively unknown to the general public until the European Parliament elections. After being noted for getting a ""significant"" vote count (and of course the success of our Swedish sister party) the mass media took interest. One month later the federal party convention occurred, with huge media attention (also, we set up a live stream on the internet), nobody wanted to miss the thing, and thanks to the silly season there was not that much else to discuss.

A partly like the MLPD (marxist-leninist party of Germany) on the other hand inherited millions from a deceased party member and started a huuuge election campaign some years ago. However the media didn't care except for that strange inheritance. Likewise their electoral success was negligible.

Soviet police troops inside the Ukraine also went house to house seizing any stored up food, leaving farm families without a morsel. All food was considered to be the ""sacred"" property of the State.

Currently, the EU dictates things like immigration policy, tax laws, and any number of other issues that should be left to sovereign states.  EU economies are not the same, and the removal of monetary policy from the toolkit of national treasuries makes stable economies subject to the vagaries of the less responsible ones.  Furthermore, bigger countries can't/won't even follow their own damn rules on things like fiscal stability, and the whole thing results in kind of a race to who can get more subsidies out of the whole shebang.

Disclaimer:  I am a firm believer in a mixture of direct and federal democracy.

False sense of security. Having nuclear arms or huge load of conventional weaponry doesn't bring real security. Real security is done by by building stable respectful and co-operative relationships to your neighbors, including Palestinians. Until Israel starts to work with its neighbors and makes a real peace with Palestinians, for example based on withdrawing to pre-1967 borders and allowing the Palestinians to set up their own fully independent state, then before that happens there is no real security.

How I see it, someday, maybe 10, 50 or 100 years from now, somebody in the middle-east will come up with a bigger stick than Israel, that somebody makes an accident somewhere in the line, and there is either a war of annihilation or nuclear holocaust in the middle-east.

Israel still has lots of sympathy and assurances from both the USA and the Europe.

Over the last few months i have been 'umming' and 'arring' over this topic, then i heard that Tony Blair was tipped to become the president should Ireland/Czech pass the treaty. Seriously? Are they becoming that transparent that they would put a lying war criminal whose own country was demanding/begging for him to leave by the end of his reign, at the helm of this united Europe?

KeithManiac (above) pointed out another astounding fact that gets glossed over in the media. Ireland voted 'No'. That's it, the people have spoken. However a year later and they have to vote again. Did they not understand what they were voting for the first time? Of course they understood, it just wasn't the answer the people in power wanted. What's the betting that if they had answered 'no' this time there would be another and another and another until Ireland voted 'correctly'? 

And i will just leave you with this, you can blast me for being a conspiracy theorist all you want, but this is a quote from the BBC news website ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/4290944.stm ):

""Bilderberg meetings often feature future political leaders shortly before they become household names. Bill Clinton went in 1991 while still governor of Arkansas, Tony Blair was there two years later while still an opposition MP. All the recent presidents of the European Commission attended Bilderberg meetings before they were appointed."" 

Why even bother voting? If we vote the wrong way to what they want, we'll have to vote again. Our forefathers certainly didn't fight and die for this version of freedom.

My concern is the increase in income inequality. It is terrible that there are failed states with incredibly poor people, but the worker productivity in the US continually goes up, while the real wages remain stagnant. This rise in productivity should be shared. Growing the pie is meaningless if the growth isn't shared to some degree.

""U.S. imperialism destroys the structure of many 3rd world countries""

Indeed. It's not just the US though. The Soviets and Europe are also guilty here. And the local dictators are also guilty.

""I don't think anyone can properly predict what the economy will do, so attempts of manipulation are baseless.""

We can make some pretty good guesses. I'm only for intervention when massive evidence demonsrates that it will improve things. Health care is the classic example. The evidence clearly shows that the free market (not the US system, but in general) has not produced a satisfactory health system anywhere in the world. Also, the US system is broken. Therefore, we should look at systems that work and base our reforms on such systems.

""The manipulation of the economy is nearly always for the advantage of the rich, and the disadvantage to the poor.""

This is often true, but it doesn't have to be. The New Deal and labor laws certainly benefitted the poor over the rich.


""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Theory_of_the_Business_Cycle""

This is a discredited theory. The evidence does not support it. Read anyone from Friedman to Stiglitz to see their criticisms of Austrian theory.

""Good lawyers are irrelevant if the populace is informed.""

Except the populace is never sufficiently informed of the law. Good lawyers are essential to navigate the legal system.

""For any system to be effective it requires an informed populace""

We have never had a universally informed populace, but we've had success in the past. I think just a critical mass has to be informed. But, of course, more is always better in this case.

""The banking scares of the 1800's, how are they any different than the current recession?""

That was basically my point. The absense of Glass-Steagall style regulations in both cases caused failure because things that looked like banks weren't regulated as banks. This stuff doesn't happen under a proper regulation regime. Also, this recession would have been much worse if it wasn't for our partial regulatory regime (e.g. the FDIC).

""Fiat money is entirely backed by confidence""

Fiat money wasn't around in the 1800s. We didn't have a pure fiat system until 1970.

""The housing bubble collapsed in a vacuum would mean that some people lose houses and some banks close, but because it caused a loss in confidence the recession continued longer than it would have. If the rest of the population continued to spend as they had before, there would be no problem.""

It wasn't the general populace that lost confidence. It was the result of a relatively few rich people getting too highly leveraged and then having their bets fail. The vast majority of people certainly had no part in causing this. Consumer spending didn't drop until the layoffs happened.",t5_6,,0,c0e11q7,0,t3_9qn3c

I'd like to know why you find the euro a good idea.  I'm ambivalent on that particular issue, but am personally worried about the long-term effects on the abilities of local governments to address regionally specific economic issues, especially given that most of the big economies have consistently violated the stability pact that went along with it.  

I believe that the stability engendered by the EU will prove to be false in the long run, but that the whole organization will continue to muddle along.  I'd write more details on this, but my fingers are extremely cold and I need to get to work.  If you want, let me know and I'll have a go at it later.

As for the laxity of EU policies, I don't find that mandating a minimum VAT or requiring a fairly hefty redistribution of wealth on a national level is particularly hands-off.  

Note, I'm not a hardcore nationalist whatsoever.  I believe strongly in fair, enforceable free trade agreements, and in other treaties that ease cross-border exchange of ideas, people and goods.  However, I don't think the EU's top-down approach is the answer, as over the past 20 years it's seen an ever-greater marginalization of national governments and their own tools of sovereignty.

So why, in countries that they have a working and viable single payer healthcare system, do they pay less per capita than us?

When you have to show restraint, that is. They even killed 1100 civilians in Lebanon while showing restraint.

&gt; Imagine that same scenario (because Hezbollah will fight Israel if they attack Iran)

Yeah, except it won't be the same scenario if Israel attacked Iran.

&gt; add hundreds, maybe thousands of large, accurate ballistic missiles raining down on Israeli military bases, nuclear facilities, and cities. Israel has no such capability. They also have no way to stop it.

Iran has 500-800 Surface-to-surface missiles, mostly old SCUDs. Israel has Hawks, Patriots and Arrows to stop them, and hundreds of aircraft to threaten launch sites.

As for StSM, Israel has the Jericho system, the latest version of which is estimated to be able to reach all of continental Europe - let alone Iran. 

The IAF also has Strike Eagles who can reach Teheran even without being refuelled by their Hercules' or 707s.

&gt; All the have are strike aircraft than can just barely reach some Iranian targets, but only after going through layer after layer of defenses.

Barely? The Strike Eagle can probably reach all of Iran with a single refuel.

And Iran's SAM network is somewhat vulnerable and partially outdated.

&gt; Who knows, maybe Iran might even be ballsy enough to send up their aircraft to make it that much more difficult for the Israelis (heavily loaded strike planes are not going to do well in a dogfight, or dodging missiles).

So you're suggesting that Iran sends its handful of 29s and bunch of 23s to fight 10 times the number of planes that Israel could send along as escort? I doubt they would fare as well as even the RDAF.

&gt; The result of a war between just Iran and their allies and Israel would be a devastating defeat for Israel

I think we tend all too often to adopt a very naive attitude when it comes to belief in the supernatural.  I mean not that people who believe in the supernatural have adopted a naive attitude -- though, of course, most of them have -- but rather that *we* have adopted a naive attitude when we suppose that those people have simply latched onto the idea of the supernatural and are thus left defenseless against any sort of suggestion.  So someone like Sam Harris can say, the only explanation we need for suicide terrorism is that the jihadis really believe what they say they believe, and to hell with someone like Robert Paper who uses research to demonstrate otherwise.  In saying so, Harris is being willfully naive.  He refuses to acknowledge that belief in the supernatural is more complicated than simply ""I believe *x* therefore I must do *y*.""

Lately I've been reading about 13th century European history, and one of the striking things about the period is how often men and women whose piety we have no reason to doubt pick and choose when they will act from piety and when they will act from self-interest or their agenda.  There are exceptions like Louis IX, but they tend to be just that -- exceptions.  Most of the popes of the period couldn't manage to be as devoted to their supernatural beliefs as Saint Louis, and they rarely made concessions to the supernatural if there was anyway to get what they wanted through secular means.

Which isn't to say that their profession of belief was a sham.  I have very little doubt that someone like Charles of Anjou legitimately harbored theistic beliefs.  But only rarely are such beliefs a straightforward lever that will put a person on a track they wouldn't otherwise have taken.  The examples of cases of people for whom such belief *was* a such a lever loom large in our consciousness, precisely because they do present such a stark contrast to our daily experience.

Faith is rarely blind.  I almost always keeps in view the person's own interest.  In that way, it isn't terribly unlike most of the phenomenon that contribute to human behavior.  To suppose that the oppression of women doesn't serve the interest of the patriarchy doing the oppressing is short-sighted; to think that parents don't exercise hegemony over their child's reproductive systems as much for the parent's agenda as for that of religion ignores the fact that heirs and progeny were offered to Abraham as the carrot, not the stick.",t5_2qh2p,,0,c0e17w9,0,t3_9quqa

I post this again as  think it a good overview and a fair time has past since I last posted it up.

Israel is the regional power. It is the big mean dog, it has all that it wants, the land, military dominance over all its neighbors, trade, the coverage of the worlds only super power. Therefore Israel wants to maintain the current power status quo as is. Israel wants to impose its will on a defeated people and call this peace Those who rule others always want that kind of peace.

I dont expect everyone, particularly you, to agree with the Palestinian POV but at least to understand it.

Palestinians do not place the same premium on peace the Israelis do. This is because they have very little. They have issues that need addressing, the right of return, the occupation of the West Bank, the annexation of Jerusalem, the economic shut down, the total control and blockade of their areas. They see peace as surrender. This is why they keep firing rockets and launching suicide attack. They want justice. The ruled always do.

To get Peace the Israelis have to address issues they simply do not want to. Until Israel is prepared to do that, there will not be peace.

It can be done, The UK showed the way when it talked to the IRA with no pre-condtions. No, ""edit the United Ireland part of your charter"" before we talk. The commander of the Londonderry IRA is now a UK member of parliament and Northern Ireland is still a part of the UK. By talking to the extremists, you fractionalise them, those that want peace, and those that want to fight. To strengthen the hand of those that want peace serious concessions have to be made, when those that want to derail the peace talks strike with rocket attacks and car bombs you have to be very careful with retaliation. Its a long slow road, but there was a time when Northern Ireland looked as hopeless as Palestine, but look at it now.

The PLO was willing to change its charter and recognize Israel, didn't get them anywhere...

The solution to the problems obvious. All the peace plans are essentially the same. Clinton's Peace Plan, the Nusseiba-Ayalon Plan, the Saudi Peace Initiative, Bush’s Road Map, Oslo, Taba summit are all similar

They all include clear measures that Israel has to take in order to make peace:

1.Dismantle the settlements.  
2.Withdraw its soldiers and civilians from the occupied territories,  
3.Allow the creation a viable Palestinian state.      
4.find a solution for the Palestinian refugees' right of return. A massive compensation package?  
5.Find a way to guarantee Israeli security. Altho' I believe having nuke addresses that.  
6.A creative way to reward Israel for giving up what it feels it has won in war.

The problem is Israel will not to go along with these plans. At some point the talks will fail. Developing new plans is a waste of time. Israel wants land, specifically the West Bank. Israel has not dismantled a single settlement built there, and has never ceased to take Palestinian lands under the guise of security. This is the underlying tactic. The aim is to create a ""reality on the ground"" where it become impossible to uproot 100,000's of settlers. The Palestinians will become a servant population within this greater Israel ruled by a compliant Palestinian authority.  

My greatest insight occurred while living in Israel.
I came to realize Israel is a typical colonialist project.
Europeans jews using American Jewish wealth, politics and violence to transfer a native population from their land using using a tried and true tactic.
You start friendly, grow in strength, then remove more natives, when they see what is happening and they resist play the ""we are the victims of native violence"" card and use greater violence to remove greater numbers. Continue until you got all you want.

There´s a cultural element permeating the economical one. Getting out of a slum is also getting out of the tight bonds of their upbringing and only education can help in cases like this. The state and federal governments have a lot of housing projects to try to solve this problems, but once again, simply pouring money in the issue won´t solve it.

It´s a well known fact that there are a lot of crimes in those slums, and that is actually what should be issue to look at.

I find this ironic, because comments made to me by atheists have been vile in a manner that if a member of another religion had made them they would be considered sectarian remarks, but if an atheist had made them, well then that's okay, people will accept that, in fact they'll pat him on the back for being 'brave'. Over here in Europe, being a theist isn't easy as you might think, people are constantly assaulting your beliefs, it's not easy being a Catholic, especially in more recent times.

&gt;When you have to show restraint, that is. They even killed 1100 civilians in Lebanon while showing restraint.

First of all, just because *Israel* calls it ""restraint"" doesn't make it so. Second, even if it was, what the hell does it matter? That has no bearing on the military facts of the matter.

&gt;Yeah, except it won't be the same scenario if Israel attacked Iran.

Right. Israel will have *multiple* foes and be in a state of open warfare, which means it will be more difficult for them (duh?).

&gt;Iran has 500-800 Surface-to-surface missiles, mostly old SCUDs.

Yes, that's how many *SCUD's* they have, not how many missiles they have all together. Last time I checked the numbers (even *estimates*) on their *other* missiles was unknowable. And don't think that the SCUD's *Iran* has are the same as the one's Saddam fired at Israel in the early 90's. Iran has upgraded the guidance systems and actually knows how to use them.

&gt;Israel has Hawks, Patriots and Arrows to stop them

BAH! You've *got* to be kidding me! Those are *completely* ineffective; wishful thinking at best. *Maybe* they'll shoot down a few on their way in, but they probably won't even destroy the warheads. Plus they don't have *nearly* enough to do the job. They are simply a propaganda tool to make people feel safe as their government hurtles them towards war.

&gt;and hundreds of aircraft to threaten launch sites.

Again, you have *no* idea what you're talking about. Israel is going to need all the planes they can send to strike the various nuclear sites throughout Iran, *not* individual, *mobile* missiles that they couldn't even find anyway (Iran's pretty big and I highly doubt they have eyes on every missile). And even if they *could* send a plane or two at each missile, they'd then have to deal with Iran's air defenses, which while not best in the world, will surely take a toll. Pretty big gamble for a bunch of missiles that could be fueled and fired long before the bombs hit them.

&gt;As for StSM, Israel has the Jericho system, the latest version of which is estimated to be able to reach all of continental Europe - let alone Iran.

The *latest* version is still in testing. The Jericho II is *much* shorter ranged and is fairly inaccurate. Only upgraded Jericho II's and better have the range to hit nuclear targets in Iran. They would never rely on it to destroy the nuclear facilities, as well they don't have that many of them.

&gt;The IAF also has Strike Eagles who can reach Teheran even without being refuelled by their Hercules' or 707s.

*IF* they use Iraqi air space and they don't have to do any significant maneuvering. I'm pretty sure being heavily laden with bombs is going to cut that range considerably as well. 

&gt;reach all of Iran with a single refuel.

Under idea conditions with drop tanks only and flying straight and slow? Still no.

&gt;And Iran's SAM network is somewhat vulnerable and partially outdated.

As is the F-15 airframe. And outdated equipment didn't stop the Serbs from downing NATO planes (including an F-117) in the Balkans. Out-dated does not equal ineffective. You can still drop bombs with F-15's, you can still shoot down F-15's with 20 year old missile systems. Iran has a pretty thorough air defense designed specifically to handle a war against the US, so it should work just as well, if not better, against Israel.

&gt;So you're suggesting that Iran sends its handful of 29s and bunch of 23s to fight 10 times the number of planes that Israel could send along as escort?

That scenario will not occur. Israel will not risk *all* of its air force. Besides, it only has so many planes that can make it without refuel. And if Iran sends their planes up that's going to cost Israel's planes more fuel and keep them in the airspace longer, which means more exposure to SAM's. Escort or not, contested airspace would complicate the hell out of the mission.

&gt;And you base this on what exactly?

Reality mostly. Also a knowledge of military history, current military weaponry, and current tactics and strategies. It also helps that I *don't* assume technology beats out everything (that's called *hubris*).

&gt;Israel has a technologically vastly superior army and would have complete aerial domination. Their Merkava's would casually roll into Persia, supported by dozens of Apaches, Blackhawks, Cobras, Eagles and Falcons.

*Army?* No, it does not. *Air Force?* Sure. But the last time they fought they tried to use their air force against an enemy *without* an air force and *still* couldn't manage to win. Oh yeah, they also used their tanks, infantry, artillery, etc. They can use planes and missiles against Iran, which means they won't likely be making much headway. If you noticed, *Hezbollah* was more than a match for the IDF's ground forces, to include top of the line armor. Why is *that?* Because sometimes technology means *nothing* and superior tactics, as well as other advantages, play a much bigger role. Your level of hubris and ignorance is laughable. Where do you even think the Israeli army is going to ""casually stroll"" in *from??* And They couldn't ""casually stroll into"" even *Southern Lebanon!* What makes you think they can do *anything* in a country dozens of times the size with a much better armed and better trained force in their way? You're *delusional*. And your knowledge of military weaponry and tools seems to be that of a high schooler who's been watching the ""History"" Channel too much.

Apache gun ships: great when you have total air supremacy. *Very* vulnerable to simple things like MANPADS or high caliber weapons, of which Iran has plenty.

Cobras: same story, less effective.

Blackhawks: forget about it if there's any significant fighting going on. They're big slow targets.

F-16's: Where are they going to refuel? Over defended enemy airspace?? 

For *that* matter, where are the *choppers* going to refuel? You expect them to make the 1000km journey over Jordanian and Iraqi airspace completely fine? Where are the attack choppers going to land to refuel? Do you even *think* about things like that? Or do you just watch your Future Weapons and jerk off?

&gt;And i'm not even talking about going nuclear, which would help them crush Iran in a week.

I guess that answers my *last* question. What do you think would happen is Israel used nukes? Do you think everyone around the world would sit there with their thumbs up their asses? The *US* certainly *wouldn't.* They would pretty much guarantee the end of their country, perhaps even with retaliatory nukes from Russia or China (if they got pissed enough). But Israel would *certainly* be dealt with.

I know you've got these little neocon fantasies built up in your head by the old men you idolize, but it's complete bullshit. There's a *reason* why the Pentagon doesn't want a war with Iran: because they know we'd get fucked up big time in the area. If Israel strikes Iran, guess who *else* gets the retaliation? That's why commanders in Iraq would probably deny Israel access to Iraqi airspace, perhaps even shoot them down.

1. The internet is very clickish, don't assume athests here are typical atheists.  Most atheists simply don't care enough about religion at all to get online and discuss it. 
2. Remember that the most obnoxious people are usually the loudest, but they're not representative of the minority.  This happens in any group, including Catholics and atheists. 
3. Don't confuse atheism with anti-religion.  Atheism just means you don't believe there is a God, which is usually a prerequisite of being anti-religion so the two are correlated a lot even though they really shouldn't be. 
4. Most atheists don't mind religion, but they do mind religion causing harm - telling Africans condoms don't work, pushing ID into schools like it's science, abstinence only sex education, keeping gay couples from having the same rights as married couples, etc.  Religion has a funny way of supporting very bad ideas when stupid/stubborn people get a hold of it. 
5. You said ""over here"" in Europe, so I'll take it that you're not American.  Keep in mind that in America, religion has been fused into politics in order for politicians to pander for votes, so it's difficult to talk politics at all without getting into religion, which is why so much conflict appears to be going on that is religious... a lot of it is really based on political issues more than religion. 
6. At least in America, atheists have a real reason to feel victimized.  One of our presidents, Bush Sr, literally said that he didn't think atheists should be considered citizens.  I fail to see how one could possibly defend that as atheists not being persecuted even if it's not in a physical way.

We should cut welfare and raise taxes on the rich not merely one or the other. At least lower taxes on small businesses so you aren't subsidizing the wealthy via the middle class. Plus this way you have a much greater chance of getting the more necessary tax increases passed. There is no reason the rich should be paying taxes like it's 1920 still especially considering these periods of low taxes on the rich have been followed by economic disasters. First the Great Depression after the roaring 20s and now the banking failures of this generation, which started in the 80s after lowering taxes on the rich by historic margins and following up by deregulating big businesses like utilities and the banking industry. Again, if you are going to deregulate then you need to pass that cake all the way around and deregulate small businesses as well or more realistically don't mess with regulations that have been working for 50+ years. We need to bring back market protections and higher taxes on the rich, these kept American prosperous for decades before Reaganomics and the religious right movement destroyed conservative politics and turned them into corporate loyalists. Now these corporations continue to go global and they owe no allegiance to the US, just profit margins. Sure in the 80s deregulation boosted the economy some, and then crashed it some, but as that trend keeps going we are selling our own opportunity, prosperity and standard of living off to other nations. The standard of living has skyrocketed in Asia while it has stagnated in the US and Europe and Canada continue to pull away from the US in providing a better standard of living. 

We say oh well we have more crime and car accidents, but that is not really a significant factor and much of that is caused by ridiculous laws many of which are pushed by corporate lobbies. Americans are mostly fat, lazy and stupid and I should know because I live here among the morons. It's sad to see the greatest democracy crumble under it's own wealth. 




Most very wealthy people are only actually paying 20% of their total income in taxes. That's almost half as much as small businesses.

Hotmail accounts 'posted online' 
By Jonathan Fildes 
Technology reporter, BBC News 

Thousands of Hotmail passwords have been hacked and posted online, BBC News has learnt. 

Microsoft, which owns the popular web-based e-mail system, said that it was aware of the claims and that it was ""investigating the situation"". 

BBC News has seen a list of more than 10,000 accounts, which technology blog Neowin.net said had been posted online. 

The blog suggested the accounts had been hacked or had been collected as part of a phishing scheme. 

Phishing involves using fake websites to lure people into revealing personal details such as bank accounts or login names and passwords. 

'Rapid response' 

Neowin claims the details were posted on 1 October to pastebin.com, a website commonly used by developers to share code. 

Although the details have since been removed, BBC News and Neowin has seen a list of 10,027 names beginning with the letters A and B. 

BBC News has confirmed that the accounts are genuine. 

""Most appear to be based in Europe,"" Tom Warren, a neowin blogger, wrote on the site. 

The list included details of Microsoft's Windows Live Hotmail accounts with email addresses ending hotmail.com, msn.com and live.com. 

Microsoft said it had ""been made aware of the claims that Windows Live IDs and passwords have been made available on the web"". 

""We're actively investigating the situation and will take appropriate steps as rapidly as possible,"" a spokesperson said. 

Neowin said that it recommended Windows Live Hotmail users to change their ""password and security question immediately"". 

Hotmail is currently the largest web-based email service.

Denmark... Is a good buffer on the European mainland. And would provide hasch and porn. 

We'd build some hundred or so nuclear plants, focus a lot of government spending on education towards making a large section of the population nuclear specialists (just building the plants would create a ridiculous amount of various kinds of jobs), and then we would sell the energy really cheap to the rest of the EU and dump prises on the market, thereby seriously fucking up the current Russian energy hegemony and our reliance on coal and gas power, and at the same time become the energy center of Europe, which would give us political leverage and provide good incentive for the EU to protect us.

And even now Microsoft still has monopolistic market share. But in their case, the governments of the US and the EU actively fought the monopoly, rather than helped it as your theory would imply.

""Standard Oil and US Steel were heavily aided, by tariffs and anti-trust acts.""

No more so than their competitors. Tariffs were standard back then. Carnegie started with nothing. He was just an amazing competitor. It wasn't until after he had monopolistic market share that he was able to manipulate the government. Same for Rockefeller. As for the anti-trust acts, I fail to see how that helped Standard Oil, considering it was used to break the company up.

""Xerox did not maintain a monopoly for very long.""

True, many monopolies do not last very long. But I'm just refuting your statement that all monopolies are created by the government.

""Nearly every utility system is a government aided monopoly.""

This is a necessity because certain things, especially utilities, are naturally monopolies. It would be extremely inefficient to have multiple water and electric systems within one locale. Also, with water and fire service, it was thoroughly demonstrated that the private market creates unsafe conditions for people.

""I don't see that as unfair.""

I'm not saying it is unfair in all cases. My concern is when a monopoly becomes powerful enough that it does use the government to maintain power when it should have competition. This nearly always occurs in the real world, as the examples you cited demonstrates. You are confusing the cause. You seem to think government corruption causes monopolies, while I am arguing that it is the other way around. For example, there was no reason for the government to favor AT&amp;T or Carnegie in the early days until they had near monopolistic power and outrageous amounts of money to bribe the government with.

This regulatory capture will always happen in the real world unless the government actively fights it. A small government is just easier to corrupt in such cases.

""I don't propose that a free market will have perfect competition, but nearly all laws passed in attempts to stop monopolies ended up aiding them.""

No, I mean heated, because except in the hottest of hot climates getting around in the heat is a matter of discomfort.  In the cold climates it's a matter of life and death.  Try going outdoors for an extended period of time in a Canadian, North European, or North USian winter.  You will get sick and you will die unless you find heated shelter.

&gt;Seriously though, doesn't it take a lot of energy to heat a miles-long tunnel 24x7 or at least many hours during the day?

So charge people to use the things like any other form of public transportation.  Trains, buses, and the ensuing stations have heating costs in winter.  I imagine that just heating a well-insulated tunnel would actually come cheaper than having to heat something *and* move it around.

EDIT: Then you could subsidize it even further by turning the walking/biking tunnels into year-round promenades.  Charge shops rent to build on the side of the tunnel so that people never have to go into the cold for certain errands.

""If you want Jews to give back your land""
Here you imply that the poster is from a certain place in the context of your argument.

But most importantly in this line you imply you should bring up the ethnicity and religion of the person you are arguing with
""On(e) should do this""

I can not see how using a persons ethnicity as an argument against them can not imply that you think their ethnicity is inferior in some way. Perhaps I am missing something here or misunderstanding the misspelling.

The difference between ethnicity and race is complicated. This is due to race not really existing genetically. For example some black Africans are more closely related to white Europeans than to other subsets of black Africans. 

In other words race is an arbitrary distinction. This does not mean however that people don't make arbitrary judgments on the abilities or worth of others based on where they are from, what they look like, or who their parents are.

You may not call it racism but to me it is just as bad and I think it matches the modern definition of racism. In the same way we call the Rwandan genocide a genocide despite those being killed not falling into your definition of race. 

 But you are correct whether you believe that Arabs are inferior to Jews or not your argument should be addressed on its merits. Unfortunately a portion of your argument was based on the Ethnicity or whatever you want to call it of the poster.

But you're right, it's not ""obvious"" that information prior to a conviction should be reported publicly. In some countries in Europe, they don't use the accused's full name.

However, think of the consequences of a policy in which the default behavior is to not report on an accusation until guilt has been affirmed:

1) A SWAT team cordons off your entire street in the middle of the night and busts down your neighbor's door and drags him out at gunpoint. Do you have a right to know what your neighbor was arrested for?

2) Your neighbor, apparently making bail, is back at home the following week and appears to be exercising his 2nd amendment right to bear and store arms. Do you have a right to know what he was arrested for?

3) He goes to trial. Do you have a right to know how prosecutors are conducting their case against him?

4) 3 months pass. Trial is over. In that time, a whole sports season has passed. Your kids are starting a new trimester. You just got back from a trip to Cabo. Your neighbor is back. What the hell happened? He's not answering his door but you hear something about a mistrial. Oh well, no problem just waiting around for another year or so in the dark about it all. All this time, though, with no one knowing what the hell went on in that initial raid, most have assumed the worst, what with the rumors even before that that your neighbor was a meth head.


Is the above situation - whether the person is actually guilty or not - really better than our current status quo of announcing this person's charges and then covering the legal proceedings? It sucks that innocent persons can have their reputations smeared before a trial, but that doesn't mean secrecy is a viable alternative. If you think police departments are secretive now, consider how more reluctant they will be to share any kind of information with you if standard procedure is to not release any identifying details of arrests or charges until a trial has been over. Some departments don't even release arrest reports  **now**- which in many states, you are entitled to...they certainly won't do it very easily if the fear of being sued by the accused is prevalent.",t5_2qh61,,0,c0e1lze,0,t3_9qxxf

Sounds like anthropology 101 raises its ugly head - subsistence farmers/hunter-gatherers didn't leave complex cultural artifacts (written works of science, philosophy, proliferation of non functional art ) for a reason, that reason is they're too busy trying to find food, having babies, and dying at age 30 to contemplate life's grand mysteries. You're romanticizing their lives, with no evidence that they have a ""richer experience"" - the ""noble savage"" is an old stereotype, and it seems hard to break.

Its not difficult to quantify artistic acheivement - subsistence farmers and hunter-gatherers produce few pieces of non-function art, and almost no non-religious art.

I think a big part of the 'regulation' required is simply to stop subsidizing fossils fuels, directly and indirectly. That means cut the $1.6B annually that goes to oil and gas (federally; there is lots more provincially, including 320M here in BC). It also means no subsidies for federal roads and airports, and it would mean imposing trade restrictions on countries that subsidize polluting industries.

Because I know you won't, here's the forword from Gore Vidal:

&gt;Sometime in the late 1950s, that world-class gossip and occasional historian, John F. Kennedy, told me how, in 1948, Harry S. Truman had been pretty much abandoned by everyone when he came to run for president. Then an American Zionist brought him two million dollars in cash, in a suitcase, aboard his whistle-stop campaign train. 'That's why our recognition of Israel was rushed through so fast.' As neither Jack nor I was an antisemite (unlike his father and my grandfather) we took this to be just another funny story about Truman and the serene corruption of American politics.

&gt;   Unfortunately, the hurried recognition of Israel as a state has resulted in forty-five years of murderous confusion, and the destruction of what Zionist fellow travellers thought would be a pluralistic state - home to its native population of Muslims, Christians and Jews, as well as a future home to peaceful European and American Jewish immigrants, even the ones who affected to believe that the great realtor in the sky had given them, in perpetuity, the lands of Judea and Samaria. Since many of the immigrants were good socialists in Europe, we assumed that they would not allow the new state to become a theocracy, and that the native Palestinians could live with them as equals. This was not meant to be. I shall not rehearse the wars and alarms of that unhappy region. But I will say that the hasty invention of Israel has poisoned the political and intellectual life of the USA, Israel's unlikely patron.

 &gt;  Unlikely, because no other minority in American history has ever hijacked so much money from the American taxpayers in order to invest in a 'homeland'. It is as if the American taxpayer had been obliged to support the Pope in his reconquest of the Papal States simply because one third of our people are Roman Catholic. Had this been attempted, there would have been a great uproar and Congress would have said no. But a religious minority of less than two per cent has bought or intimidated seventy senators (the necessary two thirds to overcome an unlikely presidential veto) while enjoying support of the media.

 &gt;  In a sense, I rather admire the way that the Israel lobby has gone about its business of seeing that billions of dollars, year after year, go to make Israel a 'bulwark against communism'. Actually, neither the USSR nor communism was ever much of a presence in the region. What America did manage to do was to turn the once friendly Arab world against us. Meanwhile, the misinformation about what is going on in the Middle East has got even greater and the principal victim of these gaudy lies - the American taxpayer to one side - is American Jewry, as it is constantly bullied by such professional terrorists as Begin and Shamir. Worse, with a few honorable exceptions, Jewish-American intellectuals abandoned liberalism for a series of demented alliances with the Christian (antisemtic) right and with the Pentagon-industrial complex. In 1985 one of them blithely wrote that when Jews arrived on the American scene they 'found liberal opinion and liberal politicians more congenial in their attitudes, more sensitive to Jewish concerns' but now it is in the Jewish interest to ally with the Protestant fundamentalists because, after all, ""is there any point in Jews hanging on dogmatically, hypocritically, to their opinions of yesteryear?' At this point the American left split and those of us who criticised our onetime Jewish allies for misguided opportunism, were promptly rewarded with the ritual epithet 'antisemite' or 'self-hating Jew'.

 &gt;  Fortunately, the voice of reason is alive and well, and in Israel, of all places. From Jerusalem, Israel Shahak never ceases to analyse not only the dismal politics of Israel today but the Talmud itself, and the effect of the entire rabbinical tradition on a small state that the right-wing rabbinate means to turn into a theocracy for Jews only. I have been reading Shahak for years. He has a satirist's eye for the confusions to be found in any religion that tries to rationalise the irrational. He has a scholar's sharp eye for textual contradictions. He is a joy to read on the great Gentile-hating Dr Maimonides.

 &gt;  Needless to say, Israel's authorities deplore Shahak. But there is not much to be done with a retired professor of chemistry who was born in Warsaw in 1933 and spent his childhood in the concentration camp at Belsen. In 1945, he came to Israel; served in the Israeli military; did not become a Marxist in the years when it was fashionable. He was - and still is - a humanist who detests imperialism whether in the names of the God of Abraham or of George Bush. Equally, he opposes with great wit and learning the totalitarian strain in Judaism. Like a highly learned Thomas Paine, Shahak illustrates the prospect before us, as well as the long history behind us, and thus he continues to reason, year after year. Those who heed him will certainly be wiser and - dare I say? - better. He is the latest, if not the last, of the great prophets.

You confuse the stupid thoughts of everyone at that time, with a moral superiority today that is not justified. Were Swedes not racists at that time? Did they give universal suffrage? 

Thomas Jefferson is a great example. For his time he was a deeply enlightened man. By our current standards he was a barbarian since he kept slaves.

""QUESTION-

Sam : Professor, An excellent programme, I am interested in the post colonial perspective and would be interested to know if you consider that the British did more harm than good by empire.

ANSWER-

Niall Ferguson : That's the big question which this series cannot and does not duck. I would never deny the downside of empire. The British enslaved millions, expropriated millions and looked on as millions starved. But, there were also really quite remarkable achievements, which people today tend to forget. In 19th and 20th centuries the British presided over an empire which encouraged free trade, invested billions in the developing world and spread the legal norms, which are indispensable for economic development. And of course in 1940 the British empire was the only thing standing between Nazi Germany and her allies and world domination. So I ultimately argue that the benefits outweighed the costs, although those costs were undeniably very high. What we need to do is to compare the empire, not with some utopian ideal, but with the real historical alternatives that contemporaries faced.

I _love_ the Reddit habit of assuming everybody is an American.

Firm upper lip, ladies and gentlemen, moderation, temperance, stuff like that. And what happened was that I lived for a few years in the shittiest parts of the West Midlands, I was totally shocked by it, and this was what changed my originally liberal way of thinking. What I saw was simply new barbarism, the absence of civilization, people living like animals with no purpose and little thinking only instinct and it got me thinking WTF could be done about it. It was clear to me more Progressive/Liberal logic would not help: you cannot turn two-legged animals back to becoming civilized people by more money, more freedom and more opportunities. And I could not find any Old World i.e. UK/Europe thinkers to help me out. I found some Conservative/Libertarian American thinkers to help me out: Charles Murray and others. I simply saw no other option. (The solution for my life was moving to Austria, it is still a very conservative, traditional, civilised country. But I'm still interested in finding a general solution.)

""Clearly, if an objective morality does exist, society has not collectively found it. Therefore, practical considerations aside, no system exists by which you can judge what counts as 'experimental' and what counts as 'normal'.""

Holy fuck. You really don't get it. The point is that not that there ""is"" an objective morality. It's not an ""is"" question. It is an ""ought"" question. Are there values we are ""ought"" to believe in because it makes society function better and people living a more fulfilling, more meaningful life?

""Social welfare exists to prevent those unfortunate enough not to be able to support themselves from dying, or suffering similar fates.""

""Unfortunate"". Because the results in people's life have nothing to do with the choiced they make? Don't try to sell me this. Of course poor people tend to fuck up their lives. This is not a question of blaming the poor: middle-class and rich people tend to fuck up their lives too, the only difference is how, for the poor, the fuck-up is more often tangible things like the foster father abusing the children, for the middle and the rich, it's ""ennui"", a less tangible feeling of living a completely meaningless, useless, pointless, purposeless existence.

See we could find an agreement or at least a very general direction if only we understood the problem of the ego, because the Pre-Moderns understood feeding the ego will make nothing good, and the Moderns forgotten it. This is _the_ core problem of the modern world, the problem of the ego.

Viktor Frankl got it right:

""Only to the extent that someone is living out this self transcendence of human existence is he truly human or does he become his true self. He becomes so, not by concerning himself with his self's actualization, but by forgetting himself and giving himself, overlooking himself and focusing outward.""

This is, simply, the shit. The only thing we have forgotten that we must focus our life not on ourselves but on bigger things, things outside of the self we consider more important than the self. Not because they are actually more important but because focusing on the self is destructive.

Vocation, family, community is one way. It's a tested way. Other ways can be suggested. I'm open for suggestion, but please do not suggest individual preferences or desires  - that's nothing but feeding the ego.

Here's what happened. Civil War veterans in the North upset about the post-war decline of patriotic nationalism started getting flags into schools, and so there started to be military-style flag ceremonies for the kids to participate in. Some ceremonies involved flag oaths, and so when Francis Bellamy was working on a Columbus anniversary thing in 1892 for a kid's catalog/magazine, he wrote up a pledge. Bellamy was a Christian socialist and saw the nation as a big family or as a big military unit, with an emphasis on loyalty and unity and obedience to one's country. He also worried about the influx of inferior blood coming from the Mediterranean and from Eastern Europe, and sought to Americanize the immigrants' children.

Over the next twenty years or so, more and more Northern schools adopted Bellamy's pledge as part of their flag ceremonies. The pledge was standardized in the '20s at the behest of patriots and veterans organizations, as part of the rise of war nationalism and the abhorrent anti-'subversive' despotism of the Wilson administration. They added ""to the United States of America"" to make sure that the children of foreigners weren't secretly pledging allegiance to their country of origin.

As many people know, students are not required to say the Pledge, thanks to a Supreme Court ruling defending the rights of Jehovah's Witnesses. But what few know is that three years before this important decision, in 1940, the very same SCOTUS lineup decided against Jehovah's Witnesses in the case *Minersville School District v. Gobitis*. In the wake of this decision, a rash of mob violence against Jehovah's Witnesses broke out: rounding and roping JWs like cattle, pouring castor oil down their throats (in one case a JW urinated blood), dousing their cars in castor oil and painting swastikas and Nazi-related epithets, draping a flag on a car and taking anyone who refused to salute or kiss the flag and smashing their heads into the car for up to nearly thirty minutes, destroying their cars with stones and bats, and in one case castration. The violence was overseen and assisted by local police officers, and about one-fifth of the 843 vigilante incidents involved members of the American Legion (currently clamoring for a anti-flag burning amendment).

And of course when ""under God"" was added to the pledge, this was done in response to a sermon by Eisenhower's minister George Docherty, in which Docherty claims that the important difference between the United States and the USSR is not our commitment to human rights and democracy as opposed to totalitarianism, nor our commitment to free enterprise as opposed to a command economy. No, it's the fact that we are a God-fearing nation as opposed to ""modern, secularized, godless humanity"". He goes on to call atheists ""spiritual parasites"".

When people from other countries find out about the Pledge of Allegiance, especially when they grew up under Soviet communism, they are little bit shocked and even embarrassed. What the fuck is the *United States* doing, having its schoolchildren recite a loyalty oath? What is this stupid, stupid shit?

I recognize that it's not all that important an issue, but the Pledge of Allegiance is just disgusting. It appeals to the most hateful, nationalistic, xenophobic, mean-spirited, bullying, authoritarian elements of American political culture, and no free nation should have anything like it in its schools.",t5_2qh2p,,0,c0e21hz,0,t3_9r1db

God has chosen the proclamation of His Word as the primary means the Holy Spirit uses to convict and save the lost: “So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ” (Romans 10:17, NASB).

We also know from Scripture that not everyone who makes a decision for Christ will continue to follow Him.

Jesus made that very clear in the parable of the sower: “‘The sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell beside the road, and it was trampled under foot and the birds of the air ate it up. Other seed fell on rocky soil, and as soon as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture. Other seed fell among the thorns; and the thorns grew up with it and choked it out. Other seed fell into the good soil, and grew up, and produced a crop a hundred times as great.’ As [Jesus] said these things, He would call out, ‘He who has ears to hear, let him hear’” (Luke 8:5–8).

Jesus understood that not all who heard the Good News of the Kingdom would follow Him. Many rejected Him. Many saw His miracles and saving power but refused to surrender their hearts to Him.

Still True
That is still true today for those who hear the Gospel. The devil quickly works to steal the meaning and power of the Gospel message from some hearts; others make a quick emotional decision only to wither later, while still others allow the cares and riches of this world to obscure the Gospel. Many do go on to live a significant life of fruitfulness and obedience to the Savior.

A few years ago, I was in Wichita, Kansas, for flight training. When I was checking into a local hotel, a young man stopped me and said, “Mr. Graham, I was at your Crusade here in Wichita 10 years ago. I gave my heart to Christ then, and I’m now in Bible school, training to be a pastor.” Praise God!

As I have traveled around the world, I have often met missionaries and evangelists who gave their lives to Christ at one of my father’s meetings and who are now reaping a spiritual harvest themselves in their own ministries.

Follow Up is Crucial
This is why it is so important that we follow up with everyone who has made a decision at our Crusade. As they come forward, people are immediately paired with a counselor who clearly explains the biblical steps for salvation. Often, even before they return home, we are able to contact them electronically, encouraging them to get involved in a local church. They also receive materials we have developed over the years that will help them grow spiritually.

I was at a conference a few days ago where I heard someone say that we should not mention sin in our preaching, because it is offensive. I was shocked. You can’t preach the Gospel of salvation without saying that “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23).

It’s our job to faithfully proclaim the Gospel. It’s our responsibility to tell all who hear that there is “none righteous, not even one” (Romans 3:10), and that we are all “dead in [our] trespasses and sin” (Ephesians 2:1).

It is only when people understand they are lost and helpless in their sinful state that they are ready to receive God’s salvation, which comes through repentance and faith in Christ’s sacrifice on the cross. And believe me, this is Good News.

The Apostle Paul said he was “not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes” (Romans 1:16).

Remember Youth for Christ?
Our Rock the River Tour this past summer was aimed at youth, and my father asked me to remind our supporters that this was the way he started his evangelistic ministry at Youth for Christ more than six decades ago, reaching out to young men and women with the saving love of Christ.

I have just returned from preaching in Colombia. Until very recently, drug cartels and violence made it one of the most dangerous countries on earth. We saw the power of the Gospel save thousands as the
Holy Spirit convicted them of sin and righteousness. It had been nearly 30 years since a citywide, united evangelistic Crusade had come to Bogotá, and the fields were truly “white for harvest” (John 4:35). You can go online to billygraham.org and read some of the amazing testimonies of God’s saving power.

As I write, we are preparing for a major Crusade in Chennai, India, in January. Our team is already on the ground, working with local churches, preparing the soil for the sowing of God’s Word. Pray with us for a great harvest.

We are actively preparing for another Rock the River evangelistic concert tour next summer aimed at youth. We will be announcing the cities and dates soon. We will also be in Osaka, Japan, for a major Crusade, as well as in South America and Eastern Europe.

We need your financial support in the coming days and weeks. God graciously uses your gifts and petitions as part of His sovereign plan to help “make disciples of all the nations” (Matthew 28:19).

Many people have asked about my father. He will turn 91 this November, and his mind is still sharp. Next month also marks 75 years since he came forward at a Mordecai Ham revival and surrendered his heart to the Lord Jesus Christ. He still loves to hear the stories of God’s saving grace at work.

May God bless you and your family,
Franklin Graham, President

In fact, I'm about to make one of these arguments.  It's not something I'm saying needs be done today, however I still think it is true.

There is no form of government, from communism to anarchy, that inherently conflicts with libertarianism.  The only condition that tends to end up being violated is that everyone under that government must be there willingly.  That is, the government must have the consent of the governed.

Libertarianism doesn't *seek* to defend natural rights by private means.  That is just an interesting way the world could develop, at least when considered from an economic perspective.

&gt;(excluding the divine right of kings)

That changes a lot though.  During more desperate times, like when the Norsemen were raiding Northern Europe, fortresses would probably be built and vulnerable people might have accepted serfdom for safety.  Once the raids ended, though, could that system have survived if people did not believe the king was appointed by God to rule their plot of land?  This is why I don't think feudalism has much to do with libertarianism or property rights.  Peasants didn't respect the kings individual right to control his land.  They respected the Will of God, which they were told was that they subjugate themselves to the will of the king.

This is what I think Jefferson was rejecting in the Declaration of Independence.  It's no longer believed that there are special men, created to govern the rest.  Rather, regular men are given powers consented to by everyone else and if they abuse their power it is proper for those who gave it through their consent to change it or take it away.  This is a rejection of authoritarianism.  If a private form of government only governs those who consent to give it power over them, then it would be consistent with the Declaration.",t5_2cneq,,0,c0e235o,0,t3_9r0sg

&gt;tell me how the poorest people in your country are richer than the poorest in Norway, Australia, Iceland, Canada, and Ireland.

lol, I guess we can add statistics to your list of shortcomings. Since the poor make up a far smaller percentage of the population in those societies, it only makes sense that they would have less of an impact on the AVERAGE numbers for health and welfare.

Compare the gypsies in Europe to the poors living in America. Then get back to me.

In the alternative, evaluate the following assertion: if we kill 99% black people in America and 90% of hispanics we will have higher HDI figures than Sweden, which has has virtually no blacks or hispanics.


&gt; To me, the purpose of an economy is to benefit as many people in that society as possible

Define ""benefit."" I dare you.

&gt;You seem to have some sort of crazy logic in which you believe the purpose of the economy is to benefit the most ""useful"" people

I already told you: the purpose of the economy is to create wealth. Don't be such a coward. Address the statements I've actually made, not the statements you WISH I'd made.

The economic system I advocate CREATES MORE WEALTH than whatever you're spouting (to be fair, it's hard to tell because you have yet to enunciate a coherent policy position on anything). More wealth is always better than less wealth. A rising tide lifts all boats. 

If I had to guess, I'd say (as I've said before) that you probably have a worthless education and no marketable skills, and are thus incapable of generating wealth. Because you are incapable of producing wealth, you turn to the next best alternative - stealing it from those who DO produce wealth. Thus your advocacy of large scale theft. 

In reality, your argument seems to boil down to law of the jungle: factory workers can steal property from factory owners. In advancing this notion you continue to ignore the obvious point that there will be no factories under such a system because no one will finance an operation that can be arbitrarily seized by poors with slingshots. Your argument also conviently ignores the observation, plain as day, that the wealthy can afford bigger guns than you. So you will be crushed either way, making your ""argument"" (to the extent that you can muster one) doubly idiotic. Of course, I haven't even delved into the fact that in order for your system to work you will have to tame people like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkfn7nXeFvk

Not ""just aren't"". It's a result of my particular biology and the developmental hormones I was exposed to in the womb and during puberty, influenced slightly by my socialization.

We *know* that gender preference is mostly biology.

We do *not* know that preference for skin color or geographical origin is similarly biological. If it is not biological, then it must be a result of cultural upbringing and attitudes developed through life experience. 

Someone hating black people because all of his direct experiences with black people have convinced him that they are lesser people (eg. a white person 200 years ago whose family owns slaves) is still a racist, even if he hasn't consciously chosen to believe that black people are inferior.

From where does the attitude/belief/*perception* that black women are less attractive derive?

There are a number of [standard bodies](http://www.jedec.org/) that are sponsored by the manufacturers themselves. A company will create a part and then submit it to Jedec (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council - as they would be a member). Discrete components have there own identification standard. I.g. the resistor color code and capacitor numbers. Diodes start with 1N and bipolars 2N i.e. the first number is one less than the number of leads. The next number is the approximate sequence of development. The last letter (such as an A refers to the approximate gain. All this is buried on the Jedec site somewhere and maybe in a few textbooks. There are exceptions to all these things though. [Europe and Japan](http://www.elexp.com/t_tranmk.htm) have entirely different numbering systems (and pinouts) for transistors. After market suppliers such as  [NTE](http://www.nteinc.com/) have their own system. ICs are a free for all as numbering goes (except for the well known parts like opamps). The military occasionally follows along (though they are turning it over more to the manufacturers) with their own [mil-spec standards](http://www.dscc.dla.mil/Programs/MilSpec/docSearch.asp). So it can be a real hodge podge.

Interestingly, the 2N2222 is such an important part, [it has it's own military standard now](http://www.dscc.dla.mil/Downloads/MilSpec/Docs/MIL-PRF-19500/prf19500ss255.pdf). 

The clock kit looks interesting, but it seems like a huge mountain to climb for what is in the end, *an LED clock* The only challenge for me would be to get the design down to just a dozen transistors (no ICS) - if that is even possible - from the 194 used. Otherwise it does not look enjoyable (to me). I've worked in electronic assembly - I emphasize the *work* part!

PRTs are more flexible but handle less traffic, they aren't necessarily very useful in town centers but are a very good idea in suburbs (and not just in US-style suburbia, they're just as interesting in european-style small-town-suburbs) or in more rural areas: you can't exactly afford to put mass-transit in every 100ppl-village, PRTs can link those to mass-transit hubs simply and flexibly.

With the investment and upkeep costs of PRT, I'd wager a bus service with the same spending would be much better. Running a fast bus service through several towns and between transit hubs adds up. The bus also allows development of the towns, while PRT doesn't have the capacity.

&gt;Why not [do away with stations]?

Stations are expensive. PRT requires platform doors (to prevent people from interfering and killing themselves with the autopilot) and grade separation (again, because the autopilot can't handle mixed traffic). 

&gt;Why couldn't you just call a PRT? If it can bring you to whatever destination you want automatically, why couldn't it bring you there from any starting point you want as well?

You mean it could come to you? Yeah it can, to the nearest station. Because it can't mix with other traffic.

&gt;Because there might not be a bus stop within 15km?

Terrible straw man. You should be ashamed. PRT is sure superior when there's no alternatives. 

If the same investment and upkeep PRT needs is instead sunk into conventional mass transit, the service is just as good and possesses surplus capacity. Additional capacity allows development of the land around it, paying itself back.

&gt;Methinks that's the point.

Why create vehicles that are inferior and more expensive than cars that don't even replace cars? PRT can theoretically replace cars, but because it would have to replace the whole street network in a city I don't see that happening anywhere.",t5_2qh16,,0,c0e2hzl,0,t3_9r09w

It's the reason we haven't had a major war in western Europe in decades and the reason why we'll probably avoid armed conflict in most of Europe for the foreseeable future.

Most of the anti-EU rhetoric in the UK is orchestrated by the Murdoch press and the daily mail is based on total falsehoods. Either outright lies or blaming the EU for legislation that's actually nothing to do with it. Bear this in mind whenever you hear anything about the EU, use critical thinking and check the facts, it's as much a magnet for disinformation here as healthcare is in the US.  

The previous Irish no-vote was largely based on lies that the EU would force them to legalise abortion and would raise taxes, the people have voted yes this time because they're better informed and realise how crucial the EU is to their economy.

Ireland's economic boom over the last decade or so was partially due to peace in Northern Ireland, but mostly due to EU money being pumped in. 

The problems of the EU are far outweighed by the problems that preceded its invention, when Europe was a collection of selfish, aggressive nation states. We've moved beyond that. This treaty is designed to make the EU MORE democratic and efficient, its necessary since we've moved from 12 member states to 27.

And it's not being destroyed at all. Have you been here? Impossible to succeed? Most people I know are very successful, but perhaps you just don't have a clue.

I can understand your confusion. I'm not suggesting you are making up these lies yourself. I'm pretty sure you just watch Fox News.

As for freedom of speech. Aren't people free to buy products from who ever they please and aren't companies free to advertise where they want? 

There is a difference between saying somebody is free to say whatever they want and consumers being forced to pay the salary of the person that says things they disagree with. Do you understand what I'm saying here? You are free to say whatever you want. And we are free to shop wherever we want, and the companies are free to advertise where they want.

Isn't the right-winged answer to all moral issues to 'vote with our wallet'? But when we do, you complain. Perhaps you don't like OUR freedom to think you are an idiot and to think fox news is an evil media empire bent on destroying the world.

Legally, currently, under the Nice Treaty, there is no mechanism for a country to leave the EU. The ""No"" side in the referendum campaign kept reminding people that Ireland couldn't be booted out of the EU for failing to ratify Lisbon. Because there is a legal bug in the Nice Treaty which means there is no mechanism for a country to leave.

In order to fix that bug, a new international treaty would have to be signed.. the law can be changed, as you say. But for this new international treaty to be signed, all 27 EU countries would have to ratify it. Meaning a parliamentary vote in 26 and a referendum in Ireland.

Thankfully, this is one of the things the Lisbon Treaty does. It has the nobody-can-leave bugfix in it. So once we pass Lisbon, then countries, such as the UK can leave.

With me so far?

Now imagine Poland and the Czech Republic ratify Lisbon.
The new post of council President is created, the High Rep is created, all the countries start voting using the new rules, etc. And let's say the EU Parliament agrees a new law giving free ponies to all 12 year old girls.

Then David Cameron comes along and says, ""Ok lads, I've Un-ratified Lisbon. Lisbon is gone. We're back to Nice."" This would be a legal WTF.

Would the President of the Council cease to exist? I guess. Would the High Rep lose his job? I suppose. Would the ponies be taken off the girls, since they now have them illegally? Hard to organise. And what about the Irish constitution? Would we have to take out the 28th amendment? (Lisbon) Would we need to have a referendum to do so?


The reality is, he couldn't un-ratify Lisbon without all the other countries agreeing. He could however simply have the UK leave the EU, as that is legally possible under Lisbon.

Yes.

But by repealing the Lisbon treaty, the UK would be saying that the Lisbon Treaty does not apply ANYWHERE, not just in the UK. That is the way this particular treaty works.

And you replied,

Sorry. You are WRONG. There is no point in me being polite: you are just wrong here. The Lisbon Treaty is an EU-wide treaty. Either all member states sign it, or none does. That is the way it works. If you think otherwise, you are wrong.

There are parts of the treaty marked as opt-in, and parts as opt-out. But the rest has an all-or-nothing approach.

Let me explain again.

Once Lisbon comes into force, David Cameron, Gordon Brown or whoever, can then legally remove the UK from the EU, without effecting any other country. But, if he repeals the Lisbon Treaty in the UK, he repeals it everywhere.

So.. just to repeat. After Lisbon comes into force..
Cameron has 2 choices.. a) is leave the EU, b) is unratify Lisbon.

A) would mean the UK legally leaves the EU.

B) means the EU would cease to exist legally.


Can you see now, why the UK can't, in practical terms, un-ratify Lisbon?

IN EUROPE!  If the UK said we're not going along Europe would have to either change, get rid or ignore us.  As they have done before with similar things they've tried to pass.  Like they've already done with this treaty and the constitution (which was really this treaty with simpler and stronger stately language).  I'm not talking about the ramifications or the waves that would be swept across Europe.

If the UK said 'NO' to anything Europe would have to scramble but the UKs 'NO' would stay a 'NO'.  The UK can say 'NO', you might not like the ramifications....but the UK can, and forever will be able, to say 'NO' at any point and for it to stick.

&gt;""Sorry. You are WRONG.""

Oh I am so dancing in the center of the RIGHT box I can't even see corners.

                 ""the Lisbon Treaty is an EU-wide treaty. Either all

Nobody was arguing otherwise.  I just said the UK could say no at any point, even after it has passed into law, and the UK decision would stand.  

You're now at the point of arguing that no country should be able to vote no or not ratify it because that would be forcing their opionions on others.  That we should accept Europe and we have to say YES, even if it is only to come out officially using EU law.  Simply not the case.

&gt;So.. just to repeat. After Lisbon comes into force.. Cameron has 2 choices.. a) is leave the EU, b) is unratify Lisbon.

&gt;A) would mean the UK legally leaves the EU.

&gt;B) means the EU would cease to exist legally.

&gt;Can you see now, why the UK can't, in practical terms, un-ratify Lisbon?

What a load of tosh B is...it would mean the EU as set out since the treaty wouldn't apply to Europe but the EU applies today and the treaty has not been ratified by all states yet.

If someone chooses to unratify the EU doesn't have to stop it can go back to where it is today, it can pass emergency powers, it can assume that action is not retrospective so the treaty doesn't apply to the UK but it does everywhere else - it can hold emergency talks to ask the UK to withdraw from the EU.

A general tendency towards liberalisation; we've seen the same things in power and telecoms. Due to high-profile failures in those areas, it's all slowing down a bit, now.

Of course, the cost to the user should not, in principle, increase with liberalisation; this means that liberalisation should only be attempted where it will reduce overall cost of provision.

From a  moral sense, it can un-ratify Lisbon. Probably from a religious, financial and artistic sense too. But it is currently the opinion of the UK lawyers who have considered the issue, that once ratified, the UK can't simply unratify Lisbon, in a strict legal sense.

Google's adwords for advertising is dead easy to setup (the key to success with adwords is using lots of keywords about your product). Be careful though... you can spend a lot of money foolishly with adwords.

For adwords to be successful you need a website, even if it is just a one or two page deal. Your particular goal with adwords is to get interested people to email you for more information. So no pricing information, no documentation, just overview of how your product will help the company (by reducing their effort at a particular task or tasks).

Do you already know people at specific companies? If so start with them... email them or if they are redditors private message them. Tell them you want to sell them a license for your software/product and that you'd like to talk to them about it. Ask for their phone number and a good time to call.

If you sell an exclusive license be aware that you can do this regionally (Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific)... though regionalism is a dying thing (thanks internet). Also if you sell an exclusive license this may or may not include the right to sub-license. The most expensive option is a global license with sub-license rights. If you do a global with sub then ask for 50k or 100k (ie. absolutely everything you want to ever earn from the product).

Sounds like your target market is quite small though (under a dozen companies). Is that correct? If so you will likely still want to price it at your ""everything you want to ever earn"" mark (with only a dozen companies you'll do well to get just 1 sale).

I would not recommend an exclusive global license with sub-license rights. For a company to take full advantage they need to also be in the business of selling software/products to their competitors.

Just sell a source code license. You'll need to draft a license... but this is relatively straight-forward: find a similar license on the internet and modify it to suit your needs and then have a lawyer review it. Having the license ready before selling is important because at some point the customer will want to know exactly what they are buying and that's not the time to be scrambling. Also be prepared for the customer to request changes to the license (lawyer time). You can skip the lawyer part if you're willing to accept the risk that you're giving away more than you expect and the risk that you may not be fully protected (but if you setup a limited liability corporation for the sales then most risks stop at your company).

Definitely setup a limited liability corporation for this. For well under $1000 you can get this done (either as a properly named company or as a numbered company operating as ""Mr. Bob's Software House""... depends on your local laws). Getting a dedicated phone number and bank account can wait. Though using your personal phone means you need to answer the phone professionally and have professional voice mail (You can answer with just your name: ""Bob Jones"", and your voice mail can be simply ""You've reached Bob Jones and I'm not available right now. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you."").

Start collecting receipts for anything you've spent related to the product (including rent, telephone, internet, software, etc). If you're successful in selling even 1 unit you will need an accountant to do your taxes for you (call it $1000 or $1500 per year for both the corporate tax return and your personal tax return). Watch out for sales taxes (the US is complicated... city, state, federal?). When you take money out of the company set aside enough to pay income tax. This is very important and very easy to skip on... don't! If you don't pay your taxes on time you will end up paying double (fines, late fees, interest)... just not worth it.

If you have receipts for lots of things and don't manage a sale, but have income from a job, then you can use the business losses to offset your income tax. For this to be worthwhile you'll need an accountant and probably $10k of loses (the account will cost you $1000 to $1500 which means you need to save at least that much on taxes... if you don't pay much in income taxes now then it may not be worth it). Business loses can carry forwards for several years (depending on where you are) so it may become worth doing in a year or two (ie. don't throw the receipts away and don't forget about them).

Attitudes like this can change over time.

I thought you might answer with that! :) That article misses an important point. If you were to read that you may think we gained our full independence in 1921. However it wasn't until the House of Commons in Westminster passed the Ireland Act in 1949 that we were internationally recognized as an independent republic. 

My point is that although you may think that Ireland gained its independence simply by declaring it so (in the 1916 proclamation or 1927 constitution) it wasn't official until the UK granted us independence.

Is it even a tax? On the forms themselves, it's referred to as ""insurance"". The Amish and similar groups managed to get themselves exempted from them on the basis that it's not a tax after all. Unfortunately, people like me can't get the same exemption... if your religion wasn't established and recognized by December 1950, too bad.

And it does inhibit a secure retirement. 12% would be more than enough with which to secure my retirement, even at my age. There simply won't be any social security left by the time I'm old enough to collect it, supposing of course that they don't just move the goalposts of retirement age.

&gt;The degree to which Reagan is out of touch with reality was best demonstrated in his concentration camp story. This was not simply a slip of the tongue, a Bushian confusion of December with September. When the Premier of Israel visited Reagan at the White House, ***the President went on and on for three quarters of an hour explaining why he was pro-Jewish: it was because, being in the Signal Corps in World War II, he visited Buchenwald shortly after the Nazi defeat and helped to take films of that camp. Reagan repeated this story the following day to an Israeli ambassador. But the truth was 180-degrees different; Reagan was not in Europe; he never saw a concentration camp; he spent the entire war in the safety of Hollywood, making films for the armed forces.*** 

&gt;The much-heralded ***1981 tax cut was more than offset by two tax increases that year. One was ""bracket creep,"" by which just inflation wafted people into higher tax brackets, so that with the same real income (in terms of purchasing power) people found themselves paying a higher proportion of their income in taxes, even though the official tax rate went down. The other was the usual whopping increase in Social Security taxes*** which, however, don’t count, in the perverse semantics of our time, as ""taxes""; they are only ""insurance premiums."" In the ensuing years the Reagan Administration has constantly raised taxes – to punish us for the fake tax cut of 1981 – beginning in 1982 with the largest single tax increase in American history, costing taxpayers $100 billion.

&gt;And then there is another charming legacy: ***the reckless inflationary course, encouraged by the Reagan Administration, of the nation’s savings-and-loan banks.*** Virtually the entire industry is now bankrupt, and FDIC – the federal agency supposedly ""insuring"" S&amp;L depositors – is bankrupt. Instead of allowing the banks and their deluded depositors to pay the price of their profligacy, everyone of both parties, including our ""free-market"" Reaganauts, is prepared to use taxpayer money or the printing press to bail out the entire industry – to the tune of an estimated 50 to 100 billion dollars. (These estimates, by the way, come from government sources, which notoriously underestimate future costs of their programs.)

-TARP precedent anyone?  Thanks for nothing, Reagan.

&gt;I have been cleaving to the strictly economic realm because even the staunchest pro-Reagan libertarian will not dare to claim that Ronnie has been a blessing for civil liberties. On the contrary. In addition to his reign of terror on Wall Street (who cares about the civil liberties of stock traders anyway?), Reagan worked to escalate toward infinity the insane ""war against drugs."" Far from the 1970s movement toward repealing marijuana laws, an ever greater flow of men and resources – countless billions of dollars – are being hysterically poured into combating a drug ""problem"" that clearly gets worse in direct proportion to the intensity of the ""war.""

&gt;The outbreak of drug fascism, moreover, is a superb illustration of the interconnectedness of civil liberty and economic freedom. Under cover of combating drugs, the government has cracked down on our economic and financial privacy, so that carrying cash has become prima fade [sic?] evidence of ""laundering"" drug money. And so the government steps up its long-cherished campaign to get people to abstain from cash and into using government-controlled banks. The government is already insinuating foreign exchange controls – now the legal obligation to ""report"" large amounts of cash taken out of the country – into our personal and economic life.

&gt;And every day more evil drugs are being found that must be denounced and outlawed: the latest is the dread menace of anabolic steroids. As part of this futile war, we are being urged by the Reaganites to endure compulsory urine testing (supervised, of course, since otherwise the testee might be able to purchase and substitute black market drug-free urine). In this grotesque proposal, government is not only not off our backs, it is now also insisting on joining us in the bathroom. 


Rothbard from article cited below.  Emphasis mine.  You noticed how Rothbard just scratches the surface.   He wrote the article so beautifully almost as if he wasnt trying because Reagan was that bad.

Go away Republican.  Here is some real Reagan from the keys of Rothbard.  Suffer, like my ""conservative"" friends do when they read this:

But you recognised it right?  It led to the Anglo Irish treaty in 1921.

If international recognition of Ireland was slow coming they SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD A **CIVIL** WAR!!!!  Warring factions took years to recognise the Anglo Irish treaty themselves.  Not because of outside influence which is relevant to this argument but because they couldn't agree on self-determination and diplomatic resolution.  It took Ireland until 1948 to form a coalition government!  Only then could the international community recognise it. Only when Ireland had passed its 1948 Republic of Ireland Act could Britain address its own laws...but Ireland got its independence in 1921; others just couldn't identify a sovereign Irish government until 27 years of inhouse squabbling were over and a matter of World War probably had them distracted.  A World War in which Britain was up to its neck and in which Ireland was recognised as being neutral!

Irish was independent when they won the war of independence marked by the treaty in 21.  Don't go blaming others that it took 27 years before a coalition government was formed to recognise.

&gt;I'm well aware. But again, NI hadn't the right to self-determination until Ireland and the UK granted it that right.

Just like health care, social security is set up in the US on one fo the least efficient models, with the per capita costs rising higher than most US peers.

I think you're overstating how horrific it was by the standards of the day.  Slavery as an institution was not limited to states that joined the Confederacy, and while the North is to be commended for seeing slavery for the evil it is, nowhere in 19th century America was a black man free to pursue life, liberty, or happiness.

It's also worth noting that a very small percentage of the South actually owned slaves.  The South of the 19th century was tremendously poor and rural, even by the standards of the day.  Most of the young men who fought and died for the South never participated in that shameful institution.

&gt; it was worse than most recent historical pariah states;

This is debatable, really.  As you noted, slavery had only recently begun to be seen as something vile in the developed world at the time of the civil war.  European powers had had legal slavery only decades before.  The condition of black people in any of these countries was tremendously poor.  I think we can agree on this.

I think it's important when we judge a state to do so within the context of history.  Ancient Rome had slaves, for example, and it was just as despicable a practice then as it is today, but we don't say that Rome was a despotic pariah state because slavery was legal there -- we understand that at the time, slavery was a common enough institution.  Those were different times.  That's not the same thing as condoning the behavior, understand.

The CSA, for better or for worse, had a government founded on the same principles the US government was founded on, and liberty, ironically, was the thing that many of the people who founded that government thought they were fighting for when they advocated secession.  As long as you weren't black, I don't think the CSA could be seen as despotic by any stretch of the imagination.  It wasn't a police state or a dictatorship or an autocracy.  It had a weaker federal government than even the US had at that time.  It was probably roughly equivalent to the United States in the late 18th century -- would you describe the US in the 1780s as despotic?

&gt; VERY much a technicality. In practice, they were fighting for states' rights, but the right that they cared about was the right to treat other humans like animals.

It was that, certainly, that was the catalyst -- the main thing the South and the North disagreed on was the institution of slavery.  At the time, the US was in expansionist mode, and new states were entering the Union with some frequency.  The real concern when it came down to it was that the South would become politically marginalized.  In the early days of the United States, the South made up fully half of the US, and had the political clout you would expect from that proportion.  As new states entered the union, though, that North/South distinction was being watered down by East and West.

The South *did* become politically marginalized, too, after the war.

&gt; Those parts of a cultural or national identity which aren't reprehensible are usually left alone, in practice.

That's not the least bit true.  Having your identity wiped away sounds like someone is doing it to you, but it happens naturally if you don't maintain a sense of identity for yourself.  For example, the Hawaiian identity is being wiped away.  Nothing reprehensible about the Hawaiians -- they're nice people with a rich and colored history.  But the influx of non-Hawaiians into their homeland, the ubiquity of mainland media, music, radio, and language -- these things have, over the course of generations, watered down Hawaiian culture to the point where Hawaiian as a language is not considered dead only because there is one island (Ni'ihau) where non-Hawaiians are not allowed to go.

See, that's what the confederate flag is, I think, for a lot of Southerners -- it's the equivalent of English-speaking Hawaiian kids taking Hawaiian language classes to try to keep their history and culture alive.",t5_2qh61,,0,c0e2z5h,0,t3_9r9v7

As an adult, I've seen (first-hand) war, and the situation in the middle east. As a child, I lived in the Mediterranean and went to a school where (much wealthier than I) children attended, both Israeli and Arab.

We could pull every single American Soldier, Sailor, Marine and Airman out of every country, and never fire a single shot or drop another bomb on any of them ever again. It would do nothing, *nothing* to stem the violence.

In fact, there would be a bloodletting and oppression of humanity the likes of which the world has never seen. The antagonism, if not hatred, ingrained in the children of this region that I saw first hand as a child, and saw again as an adult is inescapable. When I say ""the likes of which the world has never seen"" I'm not talking about holocaust-level, I'm talking megaholocaust level.

Leaving Afghanistan would invite the seige and destruction of Pakistan, potentially involving nuclear conflict with India. Dropping support of Israel, even if they deserve it, would signal the annihilation of that country, and would bolster the extremer elements of the surrounding governments.

Government backed regimes, as heinous as they may be, that act as a bulwark against wahabbism would fall, and a new dark age would descend across the region.

This isn't cold war hysteria ""falling dominos"" talk. This is real. It happened on a small scale in the 1980s in Afghanistan and you bet your ass it would happen again if we left, except this time the Taliban would be emboldened enough to go after their real target: Pakistan.

These ""free trade"" marketeers who think selling cheap chinese shit to ""consumers"" will solve the world's problems are deluding themselves. There is a deep-rooted animosity among people of the same race, nationality, whatever, that is based on religion, and is lying right beneath the surface.

""So what!?! What concern is if of ours!??!"" some marketeers ask. Well besides the 10s-100s of millions of people who would die or be enslaved by religious radicals, there is also economic factors to consider. Like it or not, the patch of worthless dirt between Africa and China is incredibly important to the west, both Europe and North America (not to mention China).

**Our strategy so far is wrong**, and I cannot begin to know how to fix it, but pulling out and relying on ""teh marketz"" to fix it is juvenile, purile, and several other forms of -ile fantasy. Advocates of a market solution to thousands of years of fighting are so detached from reality that it boggles the mind. 

I'm willing to bet few of them have ever seen the situation first-hand, and if they did, it was from behind bullet-proof glass in the back of an air conditioned, armored, Chevy Suburban as they sped from their five-star hotel to the conference center in whatever city they were ""getting real"" in.

There is a large, silent majority of people in the region who desire peace and stability. Until we learn to tap into and support them, they will continue to stand by and let the extremists rule. The way to do that is to protect them and kill as many extremists as possible, not pulling out and leaving them to swing from a noose while we try and sell the survivors mortgage-backed securities and whatever little else we produce these days.

What would you suggest they do instead of rebuilding? New Orleans has been there as an operating city for as long as any major US city, besides perhaps Boston and New York. And it has gone through stages of expansion and disaster.

If there is an economic impetus for a city to be there....there will be a city there, just how large a city can that economic impetus support and how to keep that city safe is probably the biggest debate.

If ""caring for the environment"" means having to put up with annoying kids, smelly old people and/or stupid fucks who play music off of their cell phone loudly (that's right, no earphones), well then fuck the environment, I'm gonna be burning a hole in the ozone layer but at least I do it in a quiet, leather-lined sanctuary. And I can come and go when I want, and even if it's rush hour at least I'm seperated from the smelly masses.

In my car I can listen to what I want without other people overhearing and/or commenting on what I'm listening to. I can make it smell like what I want, not body odour. If someone I don't like is in my car, I can kick them the fuck out because it's **my** car. I can go somewhere at night or on the weekend without waiting for hours. I can open the window without someone bitching about it being open. I can talk on my cell phone without bothering people, and in turn I don't get bothered by other cell-tards.

Legal personhood will been given to an entity called the European Union, much like a corporation receives corporate personhood.  This entity is not a number of states amalgamating.  It is an entity, complete with flag, currency, national anthem, army.  It is no longer referred to in terms of European communities.  The term community has been stricken.  It is an entity in its own right which just happens to have 'Union' in its name.  As a corporation is duty bound to the profit of the shareholder this entity is duty bound only to itself and the own well being of Union.  All legislation is drafted by the European Commissioners, not elected officials but appointed:   

&gt;**In carrying out its responsibilities, the Commission shall be completely independent. Without prejudice to Article 9 E(2) [18(2)], the members of the Commission shall neither seek nor take instructions from any Government or other institution, body, office or entity.**

So gone is petitioning on behalf of your country for your country.  This legal entity is blind to it.  Legislation is blind to it.  Those that draft it, their loyalty is not to an electorate.  They are not elected.  Their loyalty is to this new legal entity and only it.

It will not recognise citizens of Germany.  It will not recognise citizens of the United Kingdom, of France or of any other member state.  It will only refer to them as its citizens.  They will all be seen as citizens of this legal entity and that is only how it will address them.

As a legal entity it has provisions made for common foreign and security (chapter two)...common as in common to only it, it is only in these terms that it is obliged to see things.  This provision includes however that member states, those that sign into this single legal entity called 'Union', will 

&gt;**refrain from any action which is contrary to the interests of the Union or likely to impair its effectiveness as a cohesive force in international relations. (Article 11 [24])**

So the Union is under no obligation to see things from a member state perspective only from its own legal independent angle but all member states are prohibited from speaking out internationally against its foreign and security policy.  

A position of Council President is to be formed.  He cannot be a head of state of a member state.  He will preside over the European Council compiled of heads of member states.  The European Council appoints the European Commission's president, the commission which drafts all Union legislation legally bound to not take instruction ""from any Government or other institution, body, office or entity.""  Up until now the Commission's president could not be a head of a member state.  The new Council President not only appoints the commission, its president, he is allowed to be president over the Commission too.

The Treaty of Lisbon provides that:

&gt;**The President of the Commission shall:**

&gt;**(a) lay down guidelines within which the Commission is to work;**

and 

&gt;**A member of the Commission shall resign if the President so requests.** 

Let's call this what it is.  It's not a new constitution amalgamating several European states but a new intangible European state, operating out of other European states, with no citizens actually voting for its President or Commission but where all the constituents of the member states all called *its* citizens.  Union knows best and what is best for Union goes.

The Lisbon treaty contains so much evil-ass shit that this one-president deal is the least of our troubles.

Firstly, it means there will be a considerable shift of control from national governments to the European parliament. This is bad. Most national government are atleast somewhat comprehensible and efficient when compared to Brussels, which is a mess that no one understands.

Secondly, it reduces the amount of power and control small nations have and gives it to big nations like France and Germany. This blows.

It reduces referendum rights. So, in the future, when a law or treaty comes up that the people want to protest - tough luck, eat it up and suffer. You do not get to vote.

Christianity spread throughout Europe at a time when they were worshiping Gods that extolled the virtues found in battle and mercilessness. Norse paganism had ritualized human sacrifice and an afterlife wherein warriors were given preferential treatment.

Jesus' message of love and forgiveness was a radical departure from what these pagans had heard. Tribalism and revenge were the order of the day.

And even still to this day we find people who venerate Odin and Thor.

Paint that truck ""FUCK LIMEYS"" and ""MANCHESTER UNITED SUCKS"" and I guarantee these so called civilized Brits will have a fit too and attack them.

I borrowed this book from the library and managed to read only half of it. I'm not sure whether many of the stories are just too ""foreign"" for me, or they're not particularly good samples, or I just wasn't in the right mood. In any case, you can give it a try.

the committee put in charge of finding a ""solution"" to the drug crime on the supply side said the proper way to fix the problem is to decriminalize the supply chain -- taking it out of the hands of organized crime.  (as it is now, its allowed to sell and possess weed, but not grow it commercially -- to the point they have UAV's with infrared cameras flying around busting growops, totally retarded)  BUT theres an EU law that prevents holland from being able to do this.  at some point, holland gave up its sovereignty to the EU and now they're bullied around.  

SO the committee, having accepted that legalization is .. illegal.. said the best solution is to cater to dutch residents only and thus decreasing demand for the product, and will make the organized crime move on to greener pastures.  this obviously doesn't make sense -- but this is government we're talking about.  they're retarded.  and i don't know a way to fix it.  in Greece they just riot and throw everyone out of the capital building .. i wish they'd do that here :( and in america.
