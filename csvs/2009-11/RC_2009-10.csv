1426060693,"Goddamn, I think you might be biggest, most selfish asshole I've ever met on reddit. And that is quite the statement. This is my final post, so here is a wall of text:
 
1) You are saying it is not a valid reason because it is not true. The fact is that it is true - ask restaurant owners, or compare similar offering in America to offerings in Europe. Educate yourself a little bit before making idealistic comments. They don't tack the tip on automatically because in America it is meant to create an incentive for quality service, which is important in the service industry for repeat business. Those that continually get bad or no tips are not good enough, probably keeping customers away, and will eventually leave (the desired outcome) and someone that can retain customers is hopefully hired. Again, check the service in Europe, and you'll see. This is all predicated on people being intelligent enough to realize the price of their food is set lower because of the savings in wages. Most Americans know this.
 
2) It doesn't matter one bit whether you say it is not acceptable. Not a bit. Why? Because that is the way it is. You don't like it, but that is how wages are set. Wishing it weren't true doesn't change. *Wages are set lower for tip-based jobs.* That is reality no matter how long you close your eyes.
 
3) Yes, you can choose not to pay it. But the practice and principle behind tipping is that you only withhold your tip when they fail to deliver the service properly. You are abusing the system, and in effect stealing, when you fail to tip on properly-delivered services whose prices have been lowered down on the expectation that you tip. 
 
4) Why do you lose? You didn't actually address this one. With the tip system, you pay roughly the same amount (with the option of paying less if the service is delivered improperly), employees work harder so they don't lose tips and thus make the experience better, and more restaurants exists because the are an affordable service for a greater portion of America this way. So why do you lose again? You don't lose money, or choice, by tipping. The only people that lose are the people that render you a service it seems.
 
5) No, you are placing your stupid ideology above the tangible needs of individuals providing you a tip-based service. You think your ideology is more important than their work. 
 
On behalf of everybody who has ever rendered you a tip-based service: You're an asshole. ",False,t5_2qh11,0,t1_c0dun3s,True,True,[deleted],c0dun3s,0,0,t3_9pjaj,,offbeat,3,1254361747,3,t1_c0dujk4,,

Agreed. That's why I think it is reasonable for the benefits to accrue largely to the mother after the child is born; she has more invested in it. 

&gt;the system desperately needs reform, but forced contraception isn't the way to do it.

It wouldn't be forced. If you took advantage of the program you get an ""Enhanced Benefits Package,"" if not then you get the ""Economy Package."" 

In principle it functions the same as your idea, except that in mine the government provides the contraception instead of relying on the kids to do it themselves. 

&gt;If they cannot meet those requirements and clearly cannot support the child within 5 months of birth, off to adoption they go

There are already too many kids in the system. If we get everyone on contraception until they are reasonably capable of taking care of a kid there would be less kids in the system, and the kids that *are* there would get taken care of better.

I agree with everything you're saying, but from a funding standpoint it is a lot cheaper for the government to prevent kids than to take care of them. And this would free up resources that can be used to *encourage* childbirth among segments of the population that are highly educated and highly productive, yet are not reproducing at replacement rate. 

The second part of this plan is perhaps the most important. Encouraging the *right* people to have kids is important. Our demographic profile still looks good -- compared to Western Europe and Japan -- but that's mostly because of immigration. We need to balance out the age cross-section so that we can support all these entitlement programs that are about to kick in.

The Treaty doesn't introduce any drastic changes and will in fact make the EU more efficient.

Also, on crime fighting and the environment the Lisbon Treaty sets out provisions for closer cooperation.
27 countries working together to stop criminals operating in a free market makes sense.

Also, the clout and dedication to the environment of 27 countries implementing the one policy is far more effective than 27 conflicting ones.

Also, talk of federalism is such crap.
People consistently fail to see how the EU works. Member states call the shots and decide what laws to pass. 
When people say that the EU brought in some law, for example on agriculture, and is forcing it upon us, they fail to understand that the reason the law was passed was because their national minister for agriculture went to Brussels, met all his agricultural minister counterparts from all EU countries, voted on Ireland's behalf.

1426061488,"FWIW:
&gt; I don't think there is great representation on the No side. Actually, I think the media profile of the No campaign is fucking awful. I am continually accused of guilt by association when I declare my intention to vote No: 'how could you vote no when all the christian right, neo-con, blatant ignoramus party are campaigning for a No vote?'

&gt; It is quite disheartening.

&gt; I can forgive the media to some extent, since they will always find a simple story more newsworthy than a nuanced one. And unfortunately the arguments against the Lisbon Treaty are just that; nuanced. Arguments for the Yes side tend to be relatively simple: jobs, economics, cultural engagement with Europe. Arguments against are quite complicated: 'corporate interests will trump the rights of citizens, privatisation of social services will go ahead', 'the EU is not a very democratic institution, laws can't even be proposed by MEPs only amended' etc.

&gt; This is probably why the No campaign has made such amazingly stupid errors. The coir campaign of voting no because the minimum wage would be reduced to 1.85? Why name an amount?, the point is well made without an actual figure that you would then have to justify. They must have just pulled it out of the air, it is amateurish in the extreme and probably caused the No campaign quite a bit of damage.

&gt; The funny thing is, there is an honest, articulate and highly respected politician on the No side that could have engendered a real debate, and not just 'euthanasia will be mandatory' screaming paraniod talking points. I am of course talking about Joe Higgins. I was rather looking forward to the fact that since Declan Ganley was run out of Ireland, the obvious choice to be at the head of the No campaign was Joe Higgins, who, to be fair, has had a higher profile than the last campaign. But then, as if mocked by cruel fate, Declan (Fucking) Ganley arrives back on the scene and spends the rest of the campaign talking about whether he gets donations from US armaments manufacturers or london hedge funds.

&gt; It's almost like he is an agent provocateur, I mean what kind of ego must the man have to think that after his embarrasing failure to get elected (and then embarrasing toys-out-of-pram throwing after learning of this) that he would have had anything but a negative effect on the campaign.

&gt; To finish: an argument rarely made for voting no.

&gt; I am pro-european but I will vote no (more nuance). Why? Because this is fundamentally a bad deal for the people of Europe. We are taking a system built by accident as much as design, without a proper framework of checks and balances and turning it into a de facto federal power.

&gt; If I was asked honestly if I wanted a federal europe I would probably say yes (it is inevitable anyway, right?), but with a political system/framework capable of providing this in an equitable way to all its citizens. I suspect most people feel the same but they are making a huge leap of faith to think the Lisbon Treaty is it.

&gt; We need to establish a european political system that is right at the start. After all, it is very hard to change it once it is written into law (look at the voting system in England: think the Lib Dems would really change it to PR if they got in? I certainly doubt it). I happen to think the Irish system is one of the more equitable in the world. There are things I would change, but I think it is a reasonably good system. We are about to swap it for a system that can and will be manipulated by special interests to the detriment of the majority of its citizenry.

&gt; tl;dr: vote no :)

1426061491,"&gt;&gt; but the houses of the 1950's were actually UNUSUALLY SMALL.

&gt;In comparison to what exactly? They were larger than the majority of homes people lived in in europe which typically averaged 600~700 sq feet and especially to intercity homes in America, which were roughly the same size. 

You are now switching and choosing to compare Apples to Oranges. Doesn't matter what the ""typical"" size of home was in Europe (and what exactly constitutes ""typical"" -- average? mean? what about the ""Manor Houses"" in England? Or are we to ignore those [despite the fact that many of the help lived there as well] and instead are we to use the size of the ""worker's shed"" in the village?)

&gt;Most historians would say that a 3 bedroom house was unusually large for the era... right until 900+ square feet became the norm. Now most families live in 1500+ square foot homes.

Well, then most ""historians"" would be wrong.  Typical farm homes featured distinct kitchens, several bedrooms, a dining room, sitting room, music room, etc -- and these were quite common, not merely the ""wealthy"" (who in fact had much larger ""mansions""). 

And as I stated, yes, many immigrants lived in small ""workers housing"" that was built/owned by the local factory, etc.  But equating those to a normal ""house"" erected by a person on his own is no more relevant than it would be to compare it to the square footage of a college student's dorm room.

&gt;&gt; but we'll never again see the exponential gains that we did by the initial adoption of computers.

&gt;This is likely a false statement. ""We will never again see the exponential gains that we did by the adoption of the wheel! the printing press! The steam engine! The internal-combustion engine!, etc""

So sorry that I wasn't pedantic enough for you. What I meant (by context which you didn't comprehend) was that:

*""The exponential gains from adoption of computers will NOT happen again by the adoption of additional, faster computers. IOW, the 'economic gains' from computerization are now essentially complete (in the same way that the gains from the advent of steam power are long past, and the gains from IC engines completely integrated into the economy -- gains from further refinements in steam or IC engines are unlikely to me more than minor in influence, and likewise with further advances in computer hardware.""*

Is that explanatory enough for you? 

&gt;Technology has been continously doubling for a while now and there is no reason to see it stopping. 

And where (other than Moore's law with circuitry) do you see this phenomenal ""doubling"" going on?  My turn to demand evidence.

&gt;I can guarantee you that once we adopt quantum computing there will be a paradigmn shift.

How?  Because accounting transactions will be able to be done 100x faster?  Modern computing already happens so fast that for 99% of applications, processor chips are actually sitting ""idle"" and waiting for input the vast majority of the time. Increasing the speed of the processor itself (much like increasing the storage capacity of hard drives) will no longer gain us much of anything for a further advantage.

&gt;&gt;And my argument wasn't that Moore's law that technology should thank economic process, it was that technology is part of the economic process and cannot be excluded.

And I have sufficiently demonstrated that I not only understand it, but have a much more thorough understanding of it than you do... you simply seem to believe in a Pollyanna fashion that ""technology will save us""?

I have no doubt that we will in general continue to innovate technology wise, but we most certainly cannot predict nor ""count on"" any more ""exponential"" innovations to save our bacon. (Many of the most important innovations DID indeed come ""out of left field"" -- in that they were not ""centrally planned"" and in a few cases, entirely unexpected.)  And it will be good that such does continue -- but I would expect most such things to have incremental, evolutionary value, rather than exponential, revolutionary value; indeed I think that the ACTUAL productivity increase from computerization is LESS than commonly believed, if only because it has also become a great time-waster, and a tool for ""busywork"".

&gt;Making goods cheaper over time is a normal process though? Everything becomes cheaper over time unless it is held up through artifical means; especially like gold which is subject to governments and individuals attempting to horde it for no reason other than it being a shiny metal.

Yes and no.  It is commonly TRUE that manufacturers (and farmers) HAVE been continually increasing their productivity and efficiency -- but it is NOT something that happens ""automatically"" -- it requires significant thought, creativity, effort, and investment, in short it is a LOT of work.

And there are many things (from natural disasters, to epidemic diseases, to wars, to tyranny) that can deflate, disrupt or even ""reverse"" those innovations.

&gt;You haven't shown this though any sort of data though.

There are plenty of collections of data that DO show this though. ([Reinhart &amp; Rogoff](http://www.amazon.com/This-Time-Different-Centuries-Financial/dp/0691142165) have recently [assembled 800 years worth of data](http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2009/09/800-years-financial-folly) -- which is doubtless too large to fit into a reddit post, and took them years to assemble.) As far as your demand, I assert you should go and assemble the data to back up your position, assemble it and present it here in full, and THEN I'll consider doing the same on my side. (IOW your ""demand"" for data is absurd).



&gt;&gt;You see, since the major economic impact of Moore is now over

&gt;This isn't true in any sense. Computing power is still doubling, as is nearly all other forms of technology.
&gt;
&gt;You're like a modern day John Adams at this point. ""Men will likely never take the sky! We have reached our limits!""

It's completely true. You've provided zero evidence of this imaginary ""doubling"" of ""nearly all other forms of technology"" -- such an expansion of capability exists only in your mind. 

And the MAJOR gains from computing are now fully integrated.

It hurts me even more when I'm annoyed with European people's accents. I love European languages yet I expect them to speak english with as little an accent as me.

1426061567,"jkil, ""The no campaign use outlandish facts and downright lies in many cases"", this may be true of Cóir, a crackpot youth defence associated pro-life religious group, but it does not characterize the No campaign generally, The Socialist Party, Sinn Fein and several trade unions have made their cases for a no based on actual articles of the treaty. In particular Joe Higgins, Socialist MEP (Member of the European Parliament) has based his campaign on presenting the contents of the treaty and his interpretation of its consequences for workers rights, European Democracy, Common defense and foreign policy. 

For the most part the Yes campaign - in particular the Mainstream political parties and 'civil groups' such as 'We Belong', 'Ireland for Europe' and 'generation yes' (all with connections to mainstream political parties or in the case of generation yes the Irish Business and Employers confederation) have funneled millions of Euros (even Intel have gotten in on the act) into cynically manipulating public opinion on the treaty by representing it as critical to Ireland's economic recovery - e.g. 'For Jobs, Vote Yes', 'For Recovery, vote yes' and 'Recovery or Ruin, vote yes'. 

I have a strong feeling that the treaty will be ratified because the Irish electorate have been duped into believing that the Treaty represents some kind of economic cure-all and it will place us 'at the heart of Europe', whatever that means?

1426061576,"**1.  It's too much like Vista**
My mom couldn't even tell the difference between Windows 7 and Windows XP who says they will care if it looks like Vista.  I don't know what the author wants Windows 7 to look like, I think the interface is beautiful.

**2.It will cost too much**
It's $30 for college students and back in august it cost $50 to upgrade for everyone else.  The prices for upgrade copies are a little high, however Microsoft can't really decrease the price much more considering it's already 30% cheaper than Vista.  

**3. XP is still too popular**
This point doesn't really make too much sense.  His point is that 71% of business machines are still running XP and that when Vista was released the estimate of business migrations were way off.  However, there is one big discrepency between Vista and Windows 7.  Vista is viewed as an incompetent OS while Windows 7 is viewed as an OS that rights most of the wrongs of Vista.  Here is a quote from an infopackets article *""To date, 24 per cent of companies asked by Goldman Sachs said they would make the upgrade to Windows 7 within 18 months, while another 67 per cent said they'd make the jump eventually. That's a higher rate than Vista achieved, says Bloomberg.""*

**4. The editions are too confusing**
There will be only two versions on the shelves in stores,  Windows Home Premium and Windows Professional.  The author describes Premium for people who want to do next to nothing when in reality, what it's for is people who don't need businesslike functions.  I used Home Premium Vista and I've never ran into a moment where I wish I had a better version.  If you buy the wrong version just use the in-place upgrade, how simpler could it get?  He also argues that Ultimate is the only version that Microsoft should be selling when most people don't want the extra space for all of the Ultimate features.  Unlike Apple, Microsoft makes most of their money off of Software, they can't subsidize the price of Windows with one of their Hardware units, their solution is to simply sell the versions at different prices directed at different markets.  They can have it cheaper for those who don't need it for anything more than e-mailing and browsing the web and more expensive for users that want to do bitlocker encryption and more advanced functions.
There are only two versions offered to the public, Professional and Home, just like XP.  Ultimate will only be sold online and Starter will only be sold to netbooks.

**5.  No upgrades  are available for XP(and europe)**

This point is complete and utter crap.  He says that XP users have to buy a full version of Windows 7 in order to upgrade from XP.  You can upgrade from Windows 7 to XP with an upgrade copy however you will have to backup your data and do a clean install beforehand.  He also says that Windows 7 will have a separate EU edition without IE8.  That plan was destroyed months ago, EU users can upgrade with Windows 7 upgrade and they are getting the same version the US is getting.

**6. It's no good for netbooks**
Starter is fine for what a netbook is purposed for, to check e-mail and browse the web, not to watch or listen to media.  For those who want to get more features can simply upgrade to Home Premium for $70.

**7.  Single sign-on apps will fail**
This is the only valid point the author may have, I don't know too much about this matter so I'm just going to assume he is right about this.

**8.  There are better alternatives**
For business use, Windows is the best way to go.  The author makes a huge point on how Windows 7 will break compatibility however, switching to OS X or Linux would break just about ALL compatibility.  This point is really just showing where his allegiance lies.

**9. XP Mode may not help you**
This is pretty valid point, most businesses don't have Virtualization software to switch over however XP mode is mainly for a scenario where a company is buying new computers and they want to have a way to run legacy apps temporarily while they start to port those applications to Windows 7 compatible mode.

**10.  You'll have to contend with DRM**
I keep hearing about how Windows Vista and 7 are embedded with DRM.  If it is, it's one of the least intrusive kinds of DRMs I know of.  I haven't had to deal with it at all.  The general rule of thumb is that Intrusive DRM like the spore debacle = bad and uninstrusive DRM like pretty much every other game is good.

blacks are genetically inferior to most other races, just look at Africa and the general state of misery the people there are in, while whites in Europe and North America live happy, healthy lives.  You can also come to the realization that the blacks in Africa never came up with a written language or progressed beyond hunter/gatherer lives until Europeans made their way into Africa.  Also, look at blacks in North America and their standard of living and level of education compared to that of whites in North America.

Women essentially have the mentality of children, and should therefore be treated as such.  Women are terrible in positions of power or leadership because of their childish and petty nature.  The women that do well in such positions have more of a ""masculine nature"" and are therefore more like men than women.  The most productive thing a woman could possibly do is bear and raise children and keep the household in order and let their men take care of the affairs of the outside world. 

I hate Latin American culture, especially when it makes its way into the United States.  I think that Mexicans and other Latin Americas are basically worthless, with a few exceptions.  The ones that aren't picking fruit or working as janitors are selling drugs, stealing from others, and prolifically producing more children to perpetuate their lifestyle.  

Religion is for idiots, and most religious people I meet are idiots.  The worst religious idiot are the ones that try to convert you over to their religion.  Same goes for atheists, even though they aren't religious, they're still a bunch of whiny overzealous sheep that want nothing more than to see their beliefs propagated throughout the galaxy.

French people suck, France sucks and most of it's larger cities smell like piss, which is odd considering that their sense of taste is refined enough to enjoy good food and wine.

Asians don't have souls, but other than that, I don't really have a problem with Asians, they're usually quiet, non-violent and keep to themselves.  If I had to pick just two cultures/races to exist on the earth, it would be Asians and white Europeans.  

People who identify with ""democrats"" or other such ""liberals"" are complete idiots who don't understand economics in the least bit.  People who identify with ""republicans"" or other such ""conservatives"" are complete idiots who don't understand economics in the least bit.

Hitler was one of the greatest leaders ever to live, even though he was an evil fuck, he did incredibly great things from very humble beginnings.  He took a country that was in a severe depression, turned it into an economic powerhouse and conquered half of Europe within a short amount of time.  He also built the autobahn.   (Please don't think that I'm a Nazi, I am not a Nazi, and I don't condone genocide)

Also, all the ""politically correct"" bullshit is part of a socialist/communist agenda that's conspiring to change the US through social, rather than political change from a free and open society to a communist society, much like 1984.  That's why I really support this thread, the whole idea of PC is bullshit and it's part of the reason why our great nation is eroding away.

And, with all the climatological problems being forecast with our current population, the last thing we need is even more people using up the planet's resources, putting more CO2 in the atmosphere, dumping more ""stuff"" in landfills, etc.

The easiest way to ""fix"" social security now, assuming we even want to keep it, and that's one hell of an assumption, is to ""reset"" it to what it was when it was created.  When social security was created in 1935 the average life expectancy was ~62 years, and that was the same age one could begin to collect social security--that's why it was set at that age.  The current life expectancy is ~78 years so all we need to do is require people to live to 78 before collecting any money.

But, personally, I would prefer to abolish the whole ponzi scheme.  As it's constituted it is a moral hazard.

Of course, humans will simply create new words by borrowing them from other languages, through composition or through other mechanism, but obviously machine translation can't do that. But that was not really the point of this discussion ;)

When preasure was applied that England (and other such imperial countries) couldn't just export existing Royalty, England just made powerful residents already in the colonies into English Lords.  This may sound familiar from your early medieval history classes... or the movie Braveheart.

[Gandhi on caste](http://www.trinicenter.com/WorldNews/ghandi5.htm):

(8) To destroy caste system and adopt Western European social system means that Hindus must give up the principle of hereditary occupation which is the soul of the caste system. Hereditary principle is an eternal principle. To change it is to create disorder. I have no use for a Brahmin if I cannot call him a Brahmin for my life. It will be a chaos if every day a Brahmin is to be changed into a Shudra and a Shudra is to be changed into a Brahmin.

(9) The caste system is a natural order of society. In India it has been given a religious coating. Other countries not having understood the utility of the caste system, it existed only in a loose condition and consequently those countries have not derived from caste system the same degree of advantage which India has derived. These being my views I am opposed to all those who are out to destroy the caste system.

1426062470,"It's a definitional thing. The satellites are in fact in Geostationary Orbit. It's the ""over the EU"" part that's a bit iffy, the meaning depending upon how precisely one thinks of ""over"". It's not like the EU is a single spot on the earth.

A satellite in either geostationary or geosynchronous orbit can see over 40% of the earth's surface, so it's quite possible for geostationary satellites over the equator to be visible from Europe.

According to Wikipedia, the 3 satellites used for [EGNOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Geostationary_Navigation_Overlay_Service) are INMARSAT 3-F1, INMARSAT 3-F2, and ARTEMIS. Both INMARSAT 3-F1 and 3-F2 are over the equator, at latitudes of 0.05 degrees S and 0.01 degrees N, respectively. ARTEMIS had a failure during launch, and ended up in an off orbit, which was later somewhat corrected. It's at 6.45 degrees S, still within the equatorial band (which isn't precisely 0 degrees, but rather a certain range near the equator). You can see individual locations [here](http://www.n2yo.com/?s=23839|24307|26863).

So if by ""over the EU"" they mean ""right above the geometrical center of various countries that are part of the EU), then no, the satellites aren't over the EU. But if by ""over the EU"" one means ""over that part of the earth which includes the EU, then yes.

1426063252,"I've read a lot of comments and just want to say my piece in one go.
To the No Campaign smoke blowers: A lot of the no-campaigners talk about the treaty like it's something that Europe pulled out of the air and foisted upon us. This is simply not the case. Irish EU civil servants and elected representatives negotiated the treaty and signed it already in LISBON. . 

The amendment of the constitution will allow certain powers to Lisbon, while other changes will STILL require referenda in this country, due to  existing and maintained constitutional law. See the guarantees section from your poll card.

To lay my own cards on the table, I voted No the first time as the EU refused to release publicly a full account of the treaty. I voted Yes on this occasion, because as a result of the Irish no vote, the EU fully disclosed the treaty and published it. 

This time round, the no campaign told spurious and disingenuous lies about pay and economic development. The Yes campaign said yes to jobs. The Yes campaign is in a roundabout way more correct. Ireland currently has no credibility with foreign lenders due to it's handling of the Anglo Irish Bank scandal. The ratification of the Lisbon treaty is a gesture of good will to Europe and it's finance. If Ireland had one good line of credit, we could pump-prime our economy into recovery by reinstating large government building contracts (western rail corridor for example) and energy development projects to provide jobs. So while the Yes campaign are partly hopeful in their Yes to Jobs slugline, there is more than a grain of truth. Which is more than can be said by the No campaign's extreme claim that wages would be reduced to 1.27 an hour for which i have seen no evidence other than possible loophole abuse, which Europe is in the business of shutting down quite efficiently. 

Lastly, after the way the Irish have run the country for the past 20 years, I feel a little more European input and regulation couldn't hurt.

If you are British or French or German, and you didn't get to vote on the Lisbon treaty, it's your own country's fault. Ireland has a constitutional amendment referring to our agreements with Europe. If we want to change one of those agreements, we get a referendum. If your country doesn't have that system, that's your fucking fault.

Personally, I don't think that IS a good system anyway. A representative democracy involves voting for the candidate you trust the most to make your political decisions for you. There are almost no true direct democracies in existence. I'm Irish, I voted yes, but i would have preferred if we didn't have a referendum and our elected government made the decision for us.

A European common foreign policy would be very unlikely to be war-mongering. Britain was alone among major EU powers in supporting Iraq, and Blair got hammered for it domestically. Anyway, thanks to neutral countries like Ireland there are very clear opt-out clauses with reference to foreign policy in the agreement.

The other side of my family is a middle class land-owning family from Wexford. Both sides came to England after the war. I don't lay any claim to wanting to influence the decision in Ireland for the Irish. However the politics of Ireland directly affect those of the UK. I'm fully aware of the stunts pulled by UKIP and co, and for one I wouldn't normally agree - except for the fact that the Yes vote was funded by europe and the no vote was reliant on the likes of UKIP who wouldn't even be there if we were to have our own referendum.
I know Ireland has had problems with it's Taoiseachs in the past. God knows we've had trouble with our Prime ministers but it's wrong. It's wrong that we should be fucked over because Ireland votes yes. It's like Ireland's future being decided by a Romanian vote. It's ludicrous. Whether it's our own country's fault is irrelevant because what we're talking about is fundamentally changing the constitution of those countries. What is relevant is that these countries should be given a referendum - the reason is actually fairly clear. If you don't give country foo a referendum and you end up with a government that opposes EU membership what do you do? Do you put British troops on the streets of Dublin to protect EU cohesion because the government of the day wants to secede? That's the problem.
I respectfully understand your point about preferring that you didn't have a referendum and that the decision was made for you, but if it was brought into the debate for election it should be a defining factor/mandate in the general -having it as a referendum allows you to say 'fuck fine gael but I'm with them on issue X'.
You say that a European foreign policy would be very unlikely to be war-mongering but you're talking about the difference between Irish neutrality - something I think my country could learn a lot about - and losing that neutrality not through someone saying ""OK we're going to invade iraq"" (and bear in mind that would be the second time he says it) but through the loss of control. Ireland for what it's worth is exceptionally stable because of its neutral position. It's difficult to attack something neutral. Passing that control to the EU means that you can be forced into war regardless. Bear in mind that in the UK one of the biggest demonstrations of all time was against the very same EU President nominee's war mongering. If you think he has Ireland's interests at heart, I respectfully disagree.
Your final point about secession isn't strictly true. There's no means by which to secede from the EU (as far as I know and I would appreciate it if you point me in the right direction) because it is at heart a coal and steel treaty. No-one knows what would happen if someone secedes as it's unprecedented, but if the EU ever has a military capability then it would not be unrational to expect a military response. There is a difference between European cooperation (which I'm in favour of) and European subservience to an unaccountable body (which I'm not).





Anyways, tl;dr - It's interesting to read your views. I have some counterpoints to make. As a fellow european I have no issue with you and see you as a friend - it is our governments that I do not trust.

1426063515,"The security services kept a file on the former Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson throughout his time in office, a new book has revealed.

Defence of the Realm, the first authorised history of MI5, says there were worries about his relationships with Eastern European businessmen.

His contact with KGB officers also raised concerns.

However, the book, serialised in the Times, dismisses long-standing claims of bugging and plots against him.

Mr Wilson, who died in 1995 aged 79, was the only serving prime minister to have a permanent Secret Service file, according to the book's author Cambridge professor Christopher Andrew.

MI5 opened the dossier in 1945 when Mr Wilson became an MP after communist civil servants suggested he had similar political sympathies.

His file was so secret that he was given the pseudonym Norman John Worthington.

Sir Michael Hanley, MI5 director general from 1972, went to even greater lengths to conceal its existence by removing it from the central index, meaning any search would result in a ""no trace"".

Personal permission from Sir Michael was required to access it.

In his later years in office, Mr Wilson became increasingly obsessive about his belief that the secret services were bugging him and plotting against him.

The Times quotes from the book: ""Sitting in his study at Number Ten on his first day back in office [in February 1974], Wilson told [his business friend who Sir Michael Hanley said was not to be trusted with confidences] Lord Kissin of Camden 'there are only three people listening - you, me and MI5.

""Though MI5 was not, of course, listening in to the Prime Minister and had never actively investigated him, it still had a file on him which recorded, inter alia, his past contacts with Communists, KGB officers and other Russians.""

Harold Wilson, Labour leader for 13 years, led the country from 1964 to 1970, and then again from 1974 to 1976.

He introduced many permissive policies including decriminalising homosexual practices and legalising abortion.

His government is also remembered for the deteriorating relations with trade unions and the devaluation of the pound in 1967.

The book, to be published next week, will mark MI5's centenary. ",False,t5_6,0,t1_c0dz2uu,False,True,agike,c0dz2uu,0,0,t3_9ql1a,,reddit.com,1,1254613496,1,t3_9ql1a,,

Wow, what an insightful and informative argument you made there. You seem not to realize what the word dogma means. Allow me to enlighten you.

&gt;Dogma is the established belief or doctrine held by a religion, ideology or any kind of organization: it is authoritative and not to be disputed, doubted or diverged from

As I have said, if you don't believe the dogma you aren't part of the religion. I have already shown quite a lot of objective proof that Hitler did not believe christian dogma. Hitler was not a christian.

I have noticed that your last few posts have been nothing but the repetition of the same two arguments over and over again. It seems an almost republican-like attempt to convince, not on the strength of the argument, but on the number of times it is repeated. I have already refuted these arguments but just to make some reiterations of my own.

&gt; Hitler was a member of a church

So was almost 100% of the population of Europe in the early 20'th century, including atheists and agnostics. It means nothing.

&gt;Hitler professed belief in jesus christ

Yes in public speeches, to large crowds of christians, and when it was politically advantageous Hitler claimed to be a christian. Hitler also claimed in public speeches that he wouldn't invade Poland and that the jewish population of Germany would be allowed to leave peacefully. Now you can claim that even though he lied so much in his speeches, when he talked about his faith Hitler was telling the truth; but that is really more of a subjective argument.

750 x 3 is 2250 a month.  Almost 30 grand a year.  That's not that terrible for having sex 3 times a month.  I could live pretty well off that honestly.

Besides, don't most porn actresses do pornography to up their name value for stripping?  Or as a supplement to hooking?

Say they make 20 grand a year stripping, which seems low.. Idk, that's 50,000 grand a year.  Now if people are living a porn star life and wasting it on drugs, and shit they can't afford, that's just not my problem, and I can't feel that terrible.

And I don't think piracy, though watching porntube stuff isn't even piracy, is about ""intangibles"".  It's about looking for quality, spreading information, and finding value.  I know that sounds like bullshit but it's true.  A lot of people work shitty jobs for about as much money as the porn actress makes in 3 fucks.  Why should they drop all their money on the glut of poor product that is out there with the rising costs of food and everything else?

There are a few girls I follow, and some styles of porn I enjoy, but  most movies are 4 or 5 girls I'm not that into and one girl I like.  And then she gets paired with a guy who can't shoot a load, has a flaccid cock, or looks like a hobo beat him up.  Where is the quality?  And if it's not that it's some stupid fucking scenario with a guys dick through a pizza, or some fake white husband licking cum out of her pussy because a black guy jizzed in it?  Wtf?

I've never seen the quality of porn in America that Private brings to the table in Europe.  Just saying.

Anyway, my point is, America has changed.  We're not the land of plenty anymore.  Hell, I just read that California is circling the drain as a failed state.  Why should porn be any different?  Everybody is cutting back and there is no use blaming a lack of porn activity on technology or the internet.

I have no idea how it is to run a porn business.  I assume you offer naive and willing women money for something they would usually do for free, throw in some cameras, manage some stunt dicks, and throw some silly ideas in the mix.  I'm not trying to put you down, or put down anybody in the business, I have lots of respect for sex workers, but lets get on some real talk and be honest.

Porn exploits a man's desire to cum, a desire that is already pumped up and exaggerated by more legit media.

After uni i had some fun years, didnt do all too much, had some irregular jobs but hey, minimum wage in Belgium is 8 € an hour so it was kinda ok.  Now i'm working a full time job, i think i pay too much taxes, but seeing at the great education, healthcare and social safety net we have, I can live with it.

Our political system is filled with normal people who live in suburbs just like me. Our last prime minister had two goats and loves to go watch cycling on Sunday.  Theres few lobbying, most of my discomfort with out political system is very hard to explain to non Belgians, but we have been reforming our country for 50 years and we will continue along that road. We are an open society which is probably excessively tolerant toward new cultures flooding our country.  They are given access to our schools schools and persuaded to learn our language to get a job. Most countries would call us insane in the way we treat foreigners.

Considering media, we are one of the few truely lucky countries in the world where our public broadcasts are not allowed to advertise and get all their money from the taxpayer.  Which means our coverage of the politcal and social events is very neutral, uninfluenced by political viewpoints or big companies.  We dont have to pay for cable, our government considered they had been taxing ppl for 50 years and that by now the people had payed off the initial investments.  Cables are used by a lot of commercial companies these days, so theres plenty of revenue to give every belgian free cable access.

I smoke weed from time to time, which isnt hard to get by in Belgium. Our police force is given the lowest priority to personal cannabis use.  Anything below 5 grams will not get you any problems, it might be confiscated but you wont get fined, you dont need to see a judge, you wont have a criminal record.  

mm, some of the things that do 'annoy' me:
*Excessive high internet prices
*A politcal system which needs reform to mirror the dual country state that belgium is (i cant vote for half my governement, nor can the french part of belgium vote for dutch speaking representatives)
*Social welfare is a bit too easy on people not getting a job, the difference between working half time (24h = 800 euro a month) and living off welfare (about 600 euro) is too small

Actually I love my country, if theres any other country i would want to live its the Netherlands. I dont thinks theres many countries which are better off.

Thomas Lifson, editor and publisher, calls himself a recovering academic. After graduating from Kenyon College, he studied Japan, sociology and business as a graduate student at Harvard (3 degrees) and joined the faculty at Harvard Business School, where he also began the consulting career that was to lead him away from academia. He also taught sociology and East Asian studies at Harvard, and held visiting professorships at Columbia University and the Japanese National Museum of Ethnology. As a consultant, he has worked with major companies from the United States, Japan, Europe, and Australia at the nexus of human, organizational, and strategic issues.

A Democrat by birth, he became more conservative in adulthood as reality taught him that dreams of perfecting human society always run smack into human nature.

In 2003 he founded American Thinker. He appears frequently on the Dennis Miller radio show, as well as other talk radio programs. 

Richard Baehr, chief political correspondent, is a management consultant in the health care field, and is the president of Richard A. Baehr &amp; Associates. He frequently serves as an expert witness in healthcare litigation cases involving planning and financial matters. Richard has had a long interest in the Middle East, and American politics, and is a frequent speaker and writer on these subjects. He has spoken at many Jewish organization meetings, synagogues, and colleges on various topics: Israeli-Palestinian relations, the war in Lebanon, American politics and Israel, the future of Israel and the Middle East, and American political trends.

Richard was recently named a Visiting Fellow of the Jewish Policy Center, and was a panelist for a Jewish Policy Center Forum along with Michael Medved, John Podhoretz and David Horowitz. He has been a guest on many talk radio programs including those of Michael Medved, Dennis Miller and Milt Rosenberg. Richard also writes a commentary on the Middle East and American politics which is distributed by email. Richard is a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Kenyon College. He is married with two adult children.

Ed Lasky, news editor, is a former lawyer, and now a stock trader. Northwestern University, B.A. economics, University of Michigan Law School-J.D., Master of Management, J. L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management (Northwestern University).

A read-aholic husband of one and  father of three wonderful kids (twin girls, and a son), Ed is focused on politics, media monitoring, and foreign affairs. He started being concerned about the future when he had children. 9/11 was a motivating factor, as well. He feels fortunate to live in America

Ed has appeared on the Milt Rosenberg show in Chicago and a variety of other radio shows (including National Public Radio); has been mentioned in Newsweek and interviewed  by the NY Times. Recently he appeared on the O'Reilly Factor on Fox News.

Rick Moran is a professional writer/editor living in Streator, IL. He is a contributor to American Thinker as well as being its associate editor. He is also Chicago editor of Pajamas Media and is proprietor of the website Right Wing Nuthouse.

Larrey Anderson, submissions editor, is a writer and philosopher. He studied comparative religion, philosophy, and law at Harvard, Penn State, and Catholic University of America. He served three terms as an Idaho state senator including a stint as chairman of the Health and Welfare Committee. He retired from the senate for health reasons. He has written four books. 

He lives on the Snake River in Idaho with his wife (sometime AT contributor Eileen McDevitt) and their three Irish Water Spaniels. Larrey and Eileen have two children and three (soon to be four) grandchildren.

Marc Sheppard, environment editor, is a senior partner in a technology consultation and software development firm on Long Island, where he lives with this wife and three children. A healed former liberal, he swapped his subscription to Rolling Stone for National Review over 20 years ago.   Now an unrepentant skeptic, he writes commentary on culture, media, education and politics, with a watchful eye on their ideological hijacking through the misrepresentation of science and technology.

Keep telling yourself America is great rah-rah-rah.

The reason America is a world ecomic power has to do with decades of imperialism and what used to be a large base of natural wealth and industrial base which in turn was used to develop a successful financial industry.

The American government NEVER stayed out of the way. In the 1800s it actively supported the robber barons of its time, in the early 1900s it implemented the first instances of a welfare state and actively intervened to promote its industrial base, and favoring some of the interest of unions which substantially increased the standard of living of the working class during that time. In WWII it supported the war machine actively and incurred massive debt to keep industries working, and intervened once again in the reconstruction of Europe, while defending its economic interests abroad through military might. 

And let's not even talk about American interventionist policy during the Cold War, from actively funding the military-industrial complex, and promoting destabilization of governments abroad that did not favor American businesses.

I was asking about ""the clear message to blacks and minorities that they are not wanted"" and how if blacks also display the flag, how is it clear?

With the grades stuff and conversation. My highschool stuff: gpa was a 3.6 unweighted, 4.5 weighted, sat 1480, act 31 (both taken just once). I was in the advanced classes and lettered in multiple sports. I went to a large, D-1 out-of-state university where there were only two people from my highschool there. The other was a few years ahead and was in liberal arts. The conversation with the adviser went like this: ""I'd like to transfer into engineering"" ""sorry, we don't have any spots available for you"" ""what do you mean?"" ""while we accept many people, we only have a handful of spots you qualify for, and they're filled"" ""what do you mean qualify?"" ""are you a minority?"" ""no"" ""then you don't qualify""

I just enrolled in the courses for 3 years without their approval and stayed below everyone's radar and was a senior in credits when they finally let me officially in. This is my reference to busting my ass and lying, and conning my way in.

When 20% of a population has a representation of 40%, that's not under-represented. This was the situation in my courses, and since you weren't there, don't you dare say they were under-represented. I know it's hearsay, but it's something that I can't prove to you. This actually leads me into the only real rant I'll have where I'll remove the hat of civility... Affirmative action is the largest piece of bird shit that a donkey has ever eaten. Ok, hat back on. What it does is decrease standards to meet percentages. With decreased standards, there are people getting degrees that should have failed out. Having worked with some of these people in the real world, they're worthless and dilute the meaning of certain degrees. If you want equality, then hold everybody to the same standard of excellence. Don't just write off minorities as special and give them some candy because you think they're stupid and disadvantaged. There're plenty of scholarships out there for whatever you can think of; found one for left-handed women when searching in highschool. Cutting a break on finances is a far cry from making them work less to attain the same goal.

With the minority college students screwing me over, perhaps I was too vague. At my university, they were technically enrolled in the minority college, but pursued whatever degree they wanted to, with lower standards. We had the same courses; they were studying for the same degree; we had to work together often. They just happened to be exempted from the high standards everyone else had to uphold, and would not work on team projects, presentations, etc. The degrees were being handed to them with little effort, and they would constantly flaunt it in our faces. One of my friends from Nigeria got really pissed at them. He hated how everyone thought he was in the ""college of lower standards"" because he was black, but didn't qualify because he was ""african american"". He didn't understand why people were getting the easy path through life when he busted his ass far harder than I did to get there.

Foreigners have trouble because the various systems don't directly correlate. A russian friend of mine is completing her masters now, but had to jump through more hoops than a bengal tiger just to get an adviser to examine the courses and see which qualified for which courses. She had to take a couple extra semesters because the official translation used (went back and forth between the language through several ""official translations"" before it was classified as really official) didn't properly explain the course that was taken. That was the problem, and a student visa, but the actual coursework and grades, same stuff we put up with. The hassle is what reduces the acceptance rate; it just turns them away.

I tested out of all the ""liberal artsy"" and core courses prior to entering college. I just had to take an elective or two. All I studied in college was engineering. I didn't have the fluff you're speaking of.

Me saying blacks are one type of person would be an insult to my friends and blacks in general. The people throwing around the word are the same ones who are at the forefront of making sure nobody else uses it. The ones really hurt and upset by it aren't the ones you see on tv.

It's also not the majority either that see the flag as a symbol for hatred. Assuming ""everybody"" thinks a certain way is very problematic. If you engaged in conversation with people from all over the place, you'd be surprised in what you'd find. I've had asians and europeans see it and go ""flag of the south"" as well as europeans say ""don't people think that's some kind of hate flag?"" You'll find that many of those who harbor no ill feelings to the flag generally don't say anything because the loudest members of the crowd start yelling first. There's usually no civil discussion, just a shouting match.

You strongly see the flag as nothing more than a hate flag, and I'm just trying to inform you that it's not. Flying the flag will give people both the wrong and right idea. That's just how things happen. Plaster a sticker saying ""BOB"" on the back of a car and you'll get people thinking there's a baby in the car, or they're just named bob. Everybody interprets something a different way; it's human nature. There are far more people who don't see the rebel flag as a flag of hate than you probably imagine. I understand that many do see it as a hate flag, and they just have to live with the fact that there are many of us who don't.",False,t5_2qzb6,0,t1_c0e0c7b,False,True,topmojosun,c0e0c7b,0,0,t3_9qmxi,,IAmA,3,1254701517,3,t1_c0e0900,,

Solo vé a Cemex.

Gracias a eso, hoy, Cemex lucha por permanecer con vida y se ha visto este año a días de desaparecer. Todo esto causado por la deuda.

El indicador de confianza se pudo haber conseguido con una emisión más pequeña, o con algun otro instrumento que detonara la calificación de Moody's (que por cierto, si escuchas los debates que están teniendo en Estados Unidos sobre reformas financieras, te darás cuenta que esas ""calificaciones"" deben traer un ""caveat emptor"", y por tanto realmente no indican nada).

La confianza, por cierto, está basada en la capacidad de producir retornos futuros. ESO es lo que la hace grande. Si hoy nadie compraría deuda por 50 MDD míos, es por que no he podido probar que produciré esos retornos. Lo mismo de podría decir de Sergei Brin, creador de Google, a mi edad.

Not really.  European royalty was certainly big on marrying first cousins which is arguably incestuous but does not fall under the rubric of the universal incest taboo since many societies have condoned it throughout history.  However, European royalty was never big on fathers and brothers marrying sisters and mothers and from an anthropological perspective, that's what the incest taboo refers to.  

As for your assessment of the murder taboo, we can't really have a conversation about it unless we agree that virtually all cultures we know of  recognize a fundamental difference between murder and warfare.  *You* may not recognize the difference in your own life, but one of the basic tenets of anthropology is that you can't apply your own values to other cultures when seeking to understand them objectively, and in this case what that means is that there is an almost universally acknowledged difference between murder and warfare.  There are some pacifist cultures that don't acknowledge the difference, but that just expands the murder taboo in their instances and does not undermine its universality.

*No one* advocates the Air Force be disbanded because we all agree that while it is not *in* the Constitution, it *is* a reasonable inference therefrom. If you had any integrity in the convictions you pretend to have, you'd advocate that it be disbanded until such a time as an actual amendment could be passed -- which, since the amendment process was made intentionally unwieldy since it was meant to account for only the most exigent changes between Conventions, would likely take months to a year or more.

The facts are (can be verified on [Wikipedia - RoHS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoHS) and other linked sources):

* Environment is less polluted now, and people will be healthier thanks to RoHS. RoHS-compliant computer waste is much more recyclable.
* In spite of fear mongering, reliability of consumer electronics has not dropped, there are no widespread equipment failures due to tin whiskers or other issues, and cost of computer electronics did not increase. ""RoHS has been in force for more than 15 months now, and ~$400B RoHS-compliant products have been produced. With all of these products in the field, no significant numbers of tin whisker-related failures have been reported"". Proportionally, it's been trillions of dollars worth of RoHS-compliant equipment by now, without significant problems.
* Unregulated and untaxed pollution goes against Economics 101. The right thing to do is either heavily tax all pollution, or issue tradable pollution permits, or set outright limits, whatever has lowest costs to manage. Not doing so means much higher pollution than economically optimal due to [externality costs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality). It's fake economics to claim that regulations are always bad, and it would get you an instant failing grade in any economics course.
* Even many permanently RoHS-exempt manufacturers switched to RoHS compliance voluntarily, now that RoHS-compliance solders got better.
* Most major manufacturers like AMD, Motorola, IBM, Apple etc. are all pro-RoHS, and none of them is complaining about RoHS or calling for its recall.
* Other sources of lead are regulated to, [for car batteries EU is trying to set up obligatory recycling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_Directive). [Leaded gasoline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetra-ethyl_lead#History), which was a huge historical mistake (increase in performance thanks to leaded gasoline are very small, alternatives were always available), was banned in all countries already, what resulted in fivefold decrease in lead concentration in blood.
* All EU environmental regulations are proceeded by [scientific assessment](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eia/home.htm), vaguely analogous to what CBO does for American budget. I won't claim that there's no politics involved, as there always is some, but these targets are not pulled out of anybody's ass, unlike most lobbyist claims.

Bury it if you want, but I'm telling you that what I'm saying is true.  The movie is about the scientist coming to terms with being racially superior as a jew.  That's why the monster (representing goyim) had an ""abby normal"" inferior brain.  When he finally pronounces his name frankenstein instead of fraaahnkensteen, he's accepting his superiority as a jew and thus, the inferiority of goyim.  Music is a hypnotic theme through the movie.  It represents the goyim being mesmerized by jewish creative talent and banking magic so they continue to allow jews to run their societies.  The theme is ubiquitous through the movie.  The metaphors are spoon fed and obvious.  It really is what I'm telling you it is.  All jews know this.  Watch it again with this in mind and you will see it's true.  Here, look at this clip.

KeithManiac (above) pointed out another astounding fact that gets glossed over in the media. Ireland voted 'No'. That's it, the people have spoken. However a year later and they have to vote again. Did they not understand what they were voting for the first time? Of course they understood, it just wasn't the answer the people in power wanted. What's the betting that if they had answered 'no' this time there would be another and another and another until Ireland voted 'correctly'? 

And i will just leave you with this, you can blast me for being a conspiracy theorist all you want, but this is a quote from the BBC news website ( http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/4290944.stm ):

""Bilderberg meetings often feature future political leaders shortly before they become household names. Bill Clinton went in 1991 while still governor of Arkansas, Tony Blair was there two years later while still an opposition MP. All the recent presidents of the European Commission attended Bilderberg meetings before they were appointed."" 

Why even bother voting? If we vote the wrong way to what they want, we'll have to vote again. Our forefathers certainly didn't fight and die for this version of freedom.

1426064666,"""The poor people in the U.S. are extremely rich compared to many of ""average"" wealth in other countries""

My concern is the increase in income inequality. It is terrible that there are failed states with incredibly poor people, but the worker productivity in the US continually goes up, while the real wages remain stagnant. This rise in productivity should be shared. Growing the pie is meaningless if the growth isn't shared to some degree.

""U.S. imperialism destroys the structure of many 3rd world countries""

Indeed. It's not just the US though. The Soviets and Europe are also guilty here. And the local dictators are also guilty.

""I don't think anyone can properly predict what the economy will do, so attempts of manipulation are baseless.""

We can make some pretty good guesses. I'm only for intervention when massive evidence demonsrates that it will improve things. Health care is the classic example. The evidence clearly shows that the free market (not the US system, but in general) has not produced a satisfactory health system anywhere in the world. Also, the US system is broken. Therefore, we should look at systems that work and base our reforms on such systems.

""The manipulation of the economy is nearly always for the advantage of the rich, and the disadvantage to the poor.""

This is often true, but it doesn't have to be. The New Deal and labor laws certainly benefitted the poor over the rich.


""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Theory_of_the_Business_Cycle""

This is a discredited theory. The evidence does not support it. Read anyone from Friedman to Stiglitz to see their criticisms of Austrian theory.

""Good lawyers are irrelevant if the populace is informed.""

Except the populace is never sufficiently informed of the law. Good lawyers are essential to navigate the legal system.

""For any system to be effective it requires an informed populace""

We have never had a universally informed populace, but we've had success in the past. I think just a critical mass has to be informed. But, of course, more is always better in this case.

""The banking scares of the 1800's, how are they any different than the current recession?""

That was basically my point. The absense of Glass-Steagall style regulations in both cases caused failure because things that looked like banks weren't regulated as banks. This stuff doesn't happen under a proper regulation regime. Also, this recession would have been much worse if it wasn't for our partial regulatory regime (e.g. the FDIC).

""Fiat money is entirely backed by confidence""

Fiat money wasn't around in the 1800s. We didn't have a pure fiat system until 1970.

""The housing bubble collapsed in a vacuum would mean that some people lose houses and some banks close, but because it caused a loss in confidence the recession continued longer than it would have. If the rest of the population continued to spend as they had before, there would be no problem.""

It wasn't the general populace that lost confidence. It was the result of a relatively few rich people getting too highly leveraged and then having their bets fail.

I'd like to know why you find the euro a good idea.  I'm ambivalent on that particular issue, but am personally worried about the long-term effects on the abilities of local governments to address regionally specific economic issues, especially given that most of the big economies have consistently violated the stability pact that went along with it.  

I believe that the stability engendered by the EU will prove to be false in the long run, but that the whole organization will continue to muddle along.  I'd write more details on this, but my fingers are extremely cold and I need to get to work.  If you want, let me know and I'll have a go at it later.

As for the laxity of EU policies, I don't find that mandating a minimum VAT or requiring a fairly hefty redistribution of wealth on a national level is particularly hands-off.  

Note, I'm not a hardcore nationalist whatsoever.  I believe strongly in fair, enforceable free trade agreements, and in other treaties that ease cross-border exchange of ideas, people and goods.  However, I don't think the EU's top-down approach is the answer, as over the past 20 years it's seen an ever-greater marginalization of national governments and their own tools of sovereignty.

When you have to show restraint, that is. They even killed 1100 civilians in Lebanon while showing restraint.

&gt; Imagine that same scenario (because Hezbollah will fight Israel if they attack Iran)

Yeah, except it won't be the same scenario if Israel attacked Iran.

&gt; add hundreds, maybe thousands of large, accurate ballistic missiles raining down on Israeli military bases, nuclear facilities, and cities. Israel has no such capability. They also have no way to stop it.

Iran has 500-800 Surface-to-surface missiles, mostly old SCUDs. Israel has Hawks, Patriots and Arrows to stop them, and hundreds of aircraft to threaten launch sites.

As for StSM, Israel has the Jericho system, the latest version of which is estimated to be able to reach all of continental Europe - let alone Iran. 

The IAF also has Strike Eagles who can reach Teheran even without being refuelled by their Hercules' or 707s.

&gt; All the have are strike aircraft than can just barely reach some Iranian targets, but only after going through layer after layer of defenses.

Barely? The Strike Eagle can probably reach all of Iran with a single refuel.

And Iran's SAM network is somewhat vulnerable and partially outdated.

&gt; Who knows, maybe Iran might even be ballsy enough to send up their aircraft to make it that much more difficult for the Israelis (heavily loaded strike planes are not going to do well in a dogfight, or dodging missiles).

So you're suggesting that Iran sends its handful of 29s and bunch of 23s to fight 10 times the number of planes that Israel could send along as escort? I doubt they would fare as well as even the RDAF.

1426064802,"&gt; While I agree that religion is not unique in its ability to make good people do bad things, I still believe religion to be the most dangerous by far because of its supernatural component.

I think we tend all too often to adopt a very naive attitude when it comes to belief in the supernatural.  I mean not that people who believe in the supernatural have adopted a naive attitude -- though, of course, most of them have -- but rather that *we* have adopted a naive attitude when we suppose that those people have simply latched onto the idea of the supernatural and are thus left defenseless against any sort of suggestion.  So someone like Sam Harris can say, the only explanation we need for suicide terrorism is that the jihadis really believe what they say they believe, and to hell with someone like Robert Paper who uses research to demonstrate otherwise.  In saying so, Harris is being willfully naive.  He refuses to acknowledge that belief in the supernatural is more complicated than simply ""I believe *x* therefore I must do *y*.""

Lately I've been reading about 13th century European history, and one of the striking things about the period is how often men and women whose piety we have no reason to doubt pick and choose when they will act from piety and when they will act from self-interest or their agenda.  There are exceptions like Louis IX, but they tend to be just that -- exceptions.  Most of the popes of the period couldn't manage to be as devoted to their supernatural beliefs as Saint Louis, and they rarely made concessions to the supernatural if there was anyway to get what they wanted through secular means.

Which isn't to say that their profession of belief was a sham.  I have very little doubt that someone like Charles of Anjou legitimately harbored theistic beliefs.  But only rarely are such beliefs a straightforward lever that will put a person on a track they wouldn't otherwise have taken.  The examples of cases of people for whom such belief *was* a such a lever loom large in our consciousness, precisely because they do present such a stark contrast to our daily experience.

Faith is rarely blind.  I almost always keeps in view the person's own interest.  In that way, it isn't terribly unlike most of the phenomenon that contribute to human behavior.  To suppose that the oppression of women doesn't serve the interest of the patriarchy doing the oppressing is short-sighted; to think that parents don't exercise hegemony over their child's reproductive systems as much for the parent's agenda as for that of religion ignores the fact that heirs and progeny were offered to Abraham as the carrot, not the stick.",False,t5_2qh2p,0,t1_c0e17w9,False,True,blackstar9000,c0e17w9,0,0,t3_9quqa,,atheism,3,1254758934,3,t1_c0e146e,,

Again, if you are going to deregulate then you need to pass that cake all the way around and deregulate small businesses as well or more realistically don't mess with regulations that have been working for 50+ years.

Hotmail accounts 'posted online' 
By Jonathan Fildes 
Technology reporter, BBC News 

Thousands of Hotmail passwords have been hacked and posted online, BBC News has learnt. 

Microsoft, which owns the popular web-based e-mail system, said that it was aware of the claims and that it was ""investigating the situation"". 

BBC News has seen a list of more than 10,000 accounts, which technology blog Neowin.net said had been posted online. 

The blog suggested the accounts had been hacked or had been collected as part of a phishing scheme. 

Phishing involves using fake websites to lure people into revealing personal details such as bank accounts or login names and passwords. 

'Rapid response' 

Neowin claims the details were posted on 1 October to pastebin.com, a website commonly used by developers to share code. 

Although the details have since been removed, BBC News and Neowin has seen a list of 10,027 names beginning with the letters A and B. 

BBC News has confirmed that the accounts are genuine. 

""Most appear to be based in Europe,"" Tom Warren, a neowin blogger, wrote on the site. 

The list included details of Microsoft's Windows Live Hotmail accounts with email addresses ending hotmail.com, msn.com and live.com. 

Microsoft said it had ""been made aware of the claims that Windows Live IDs and passwords have been made available on the web"". 

""We're actively investigating the situation and will take appropriate steps as rapidly as possible,"" a spokesperson said. 

Neowin said that it recommended Windows Live Hotmail users to change their ""password and security question immediately"". 

Hotmail is currently the largest web-based email service.

Here you imply that the poster is from a certain place in the context of your argument.

But most importantly in this line you imply you should bring up the ethnicity and religion of the person you are arguing with
""On(e) should do this""

I can not see how using a persons ethnicity as an argument against them can not imply that you think their ethnicity is inferior in some way. Perhaps I am missing something here or misunderstanding the misspelling.

The difference between ethnicity and race is complicated. This is due to race not really existing genetically. For example some black Africans are more closely related to white Europeans than to other subsets of black Africans. 

In other words race is an arbitrary distinction. This does not mean however that people don't make arbitrary judgments on the abilities or worth of others based on where they are from, what they look like, or who their parents are.

You may not call it racism but to me it is just as bad and I think it matches the modern definition of racism. In the same way we call the Rwandan genocide a genocide despite those being killed not falling into your definition of race. 

 But you are correct whether you believe that Arabs are inferior to Jews or not your argument should be addressed on its merits. Unfortunately a portion of your argument was based on the Ethnicity or whatever you want to call it of the poster.

1426065232,"We saw the Holy Spirit of God work in the hearts of those who heard the preaching of the Gospel. God has chosen the proclamation of His Word as the primary means the Holy Spirit uses to convict and save the lost: “So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ” (Romans 10:17, NASB).

We also know from Scripture that not everyone who makes a decision for Christ will continue to follow Him.

Jesus made that very clear in the parable of the sower: “‘The sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell beside the road, and it was trampled under foot and the birds of the air ate it up. Other seed fell on rocky soil, and as soon as it grew up, it withered away, because it had no moisture. Other seed fell among the thorns; and the thorns grew up with it and choked it out. Other seed fell into the good soil, and grew up, and produced a crop a hundred times as great.’ As [Jesus] said these things, He would call out, ‘He who has ears to hear, let him hear’” (Luke 8:5–8).

Jesus understood that not all who heard the Good News of the Kingdom would follow Him. Many rejected Him. Many saw His miracles and saving power but refused to surrender their hearts to Him.

Still True
That is still true today for those who hear the Gospel. The devil quickly works to steal the meaning and power of the Gospel message from some hearts; others make a quick emotional decision only to wither later, while still others allow the cares and riches of this world to obscure the Gospel. Many do go on to live a significant life of fruitfulness and obedience to the Savior.

A few years ago, I was in Wichita, Kansas, for flight training. When I was checking into a local hotel, a young man stopped me and said, “Mr. Graham, I was at your Crusade here in Wichita 10 years ago. I gave my heart to Christ then, and I’m now in Bible school, training to be a pastor.” Praise God!

As I have traveled around the world, I have often met missionaries and evangelists who gave their lives to Christ at one of my father’s meetings and who are now reaping a spiritual harvest themselves in their own ministries.

Follow Up is Crucial
This is why it is so important that we follow up with everyone who has made a decision at our Crusade. As they come forward, people are immediately paired with a counselor who clearly explains the biblical steps for salvation. Often, even before they return home, we are able to contact them electronically, encouraging them to get involved in a local church. They also receive materials we have developed over the years that will help them grow spiritually.

I was at a conference a few days ago where I heard someone say that we should not mention sin in our preaching, because it is offensive. I was shocked. You can’t preach the Gospel of salvation without saying that “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23).

It’s our job to faithfully proclaim the Gospel. It’s our responsibility to tell all who hear that there is “none righteous, not even one” (Romans 3:10), and that we are all “dead in [our] trespasses and sin” (Ephesians 2:1).

It is only when people understand they are lost and helpless in their sinful state that they are ready to receive God’s salvation, which comes through repentance and faith in Christ’s sacrifice on the cross. And believe me, this is Good News.

The Apostle Paul said he was “not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes” (Romans 1:16).

Remember Youth for Christ?
Our Rock the River Tour this past summer was aimed at youth, and my father asked me to remind our supporters that this was the way he started his evangelistic ministry at Youth for Christ more than six decades ago, reaching out to young men and women with the saving love of Christ.

I have just returned from preaching in Colombia. Until very recently, drug cartels and violence made it one of the most dangerous countries on earth. We saw the power of the Gospel save thousands as the
Holy Spirit convicted them of sin and righteousness. It had been nearly 30 years since a citywide, united evangelistic Crusade had come to Bogotá, and the fields were truly “white for harvest” (John 4:35). You can go online to billygraham.org and read some of the amazing testimonies of God’s saving power.

As I write, we are preparing for a major Crusade in Chennai, India, in January. Our team is already on the ground, working with local churches, preparing the soil for the sowing of God’s Word. Pray with us for a great harvest.

We are actively preparing for another Rock the River evangelistic concert tour next summer aimed at youth. We will be announcing the cities and dates soon. We will also be in Osaka, Japan, for a major Crusade, as well as in South America and Eastern Europe.

We need your financial support in the coming days and weeks. God graciously uses your gifts and petitions as part of His sovereign plan to help “make disciples of all the nations” (Matthew 28:19).

Many people have asked about my father. He will turn 91 this November, and his mind is still sharp. Next month also marks 75 years since he came forward at a Mordecai Ham revival and surrendered his heart to the Lord Jesus Christ. He still loves to hear the stories of God’s saving grace at work.

May God bless you and your family,
Franklin Graham, President

1426065257,"Yes, you are talking about an extreme form, though one that a lot of libertarians will entertain and argue about intellectually, which I think is often mistaken for arguments for practical actions that should be taken right now.  In fact, I'm about to make one of these arguments.  It's not something I'm saying needs be done today, however I still think it is true.

There is no form of government, from communism to anarchy, that inherently conflicts with libertarianism.  The only condition that tends to end up being violated is that everyone under that government must be there willingly.  That is, the government must have the consent of the governed.

Libertarianism doesn't *seek* to defend natural rights by private means.  That is just an interesting way the world could develop, at least when considered from an economic perspective.

&gt;(excluding the divine right of kings)

That changes a lot though.  During more desperate times, like when the Norsemen were raiding Northern Europe, fortresses would probably be built and vulnerable people might have accepted serfdom for safety.  Once the raids ended, though, could that system have survived if people did not believe the king was appointed by God to rule their plot of land?  This is why I don't think feudalism has much to do with libertarianism or property rights.  Peasants didn't respect the kings individual right to control his land.  They respected the Will of God, which they were told was that they subjugate themselves to the will of the king.

This is what I think Jefferson was rejecting in the Declaration of Independence.  It's no longer believed that there are special men, created to govern the rest.  Rather, regular men are given powers consented to by everyone else and if they abuse their power it is proper for those who gave it through their consent to change it or take it away.  This is a rejection of authoritarianism.  If a private form of government only governs those who consent to give it power over them, then it would be consistent with the Declaration.",False,t5_2cneq,0,t1_c0e235o,True,True,IrrigatedPancake,c0e235o,0,0,t3_9r0sg,,politics,2,1254793857,2,t1_c0e1vdc,,

Rather sad that so many people nowadays associate the name ""Kubrick"" with basically only three movies: *2001*, *A Clockwork Orange* and *Eyes Wide Shut*, and very often to express praise or hate for the first, to associate the middle one only with perversion and violence, and very often dismiss the last one.

Legally, currently, under the Nice Treaty, there is no mechanism for a country to leave the EU. The ""No"" side in the referendum campaign kept reminding people that Ireland couldn't be booted out of the EU for failing to ratify Lisbon. Because there is a legal bug in the Nice Treaty which means there is no mechanism for a country to leave.

In order to fix that bug, a new international treaty would have to be signed.. the law can be changed, as you say. But for this new international treaty to be signed, all 27 EU countries would have to ratify it. Meaning a parliamentary vote in 26 and a referendum in Ireland.

Thankfully, this is one of the things the Lisbon Treaty does. It has the nobody-can-leave bugfix in it. So once we pass Lisbon, then countries, such as the UK can leave.

With me so far?

Now imagine Poland and the Czech Republic ratify Lisbon.
The new post of council President is created, the High Rep is created, all the countries start voting using the new rules, etc. And let's say the EU Parliament agrees a new law giving free ponies to all 12 year old girls.

Then David Cameron comes along and says, ""Ok lads, I've Un-ratified Lisbon. Lisbon is gone. We're back to Nice."" This would be a legal WTF.

Would the President of the Council cease to exist? I guess. Would the High Rep lose his job? I suppose. Would the ponies be taken off the girls, since they now have them illegally? Hard to organise. And what about the Irish constitution? Would we have to take out the 28th amendment? (Lisbon) Would we need to have a referendum to do so?


The reality is, he couldn't un-ratify Lisbon without all the other countries agreeing. He could however simply have the UK leave the EU, as that is legally possible under Lisbon.

&gt;There you go again with 'man makes laws, man cannot change them'. 

The UK can change UK law anytime they want. 

But what you are suggesting is the UK changing EU law, including Irish law, French law, etc. Sorry, you can't change our laws unless we agree to it. And given that it took 10 years to negotiate the Lisbon Treaty, other countries aren't going to be in any mood to agree.

IN EUROPE!  If the UK said we're not going along Europe would have to either change, get rid or ignore us.  As they have done before with similar things they've tried to pass.  Like they've already done with this treaty and the constitution (which was really this treaty with simpler and stronger stately language).  I'm not talking about the ramifications or the waves that would be swept across Europe.

If the UK said 'NO' to anything Europe would have to scramble but the UKs 'NO' would stay a 'NO'.  The UK can say 'NO', you might not like the ramifications....but the UK can, and forever will be able, to say 'NO' at any point and for it to stick.

                  works. If you think otherwise, you are wrong.""

Nobody was arguing otherwise.  I just said the UK could say no at any point, even after it has passed into law, and the UK decision would stand.  

You're now at the point of arguing that no country should be able to vote no or not ratify it because that would be forcing their opionions on others.  That we should accept Europe and we have to say YES, even if it is only to come out officially using EU law.  Simply not the case.

&gt;So.. just to repeat. After Lisbon comes into force.. Cameron has 2 choices.. a) is leave the EU, b) is unratify Lisbon.

&gt;A) would mean the UK legally leaves the EU.

&gt;B) means the EU would cease to exist legally.

&gt;Can you see now, why the UK can't, in practical terms, un-ratify Lisbon?

What a load of tosh B is...it would mean the EU as set out since the treaty wouldn't apply to Europe but the EU applies today and the treaty has not been ratified by all states yet.

If someone chooses to unratify the EU doesn't have to stop it can go back to where it is today, it can pass emergency powers, it can assume that action is not retrospective so the treaty doesn't apply to the UK but it does everywhere else - it can hold emergency talks to ask the UK to withdraw from the EU.  

If you throw a birthday party and the birthday girl leaves half way through it doesn't mean the party has to stop.  They've done a great conditioning job on you.  That's like saying Scotland can't have independence without killing the UK.  Sure it can, the face of the UK and what it meant would just have changed a little.

And if the UK said they no longer ratify Lisbon, the rest of the EU would be like ""So? We're not recognising that"".

1426065795,"&gt; See, from my perspective, the Confederacy was something so horrific that any glorification of it seems perverse

I think you're overstating how horrific it was by the standards of the day.  Slavery as an institution was not limited to states that joined the Confederacy, and while the North is to be commended for seeing slavery for the evil it is, nowhere in 19th century America was a black man free to pursue life, liberty, or happiness.

It's also worth noting that a very small percentage of the South actually owned slaves.  The South of the 19th century was tremendously poor and rural, even by the standards of the day.  Most of the young men who fought and died for the South never participated in that shameful institution.

&gt; it was worse than most recent historical pariah states;

This is debatable, really.  As you noted, slavery had only recently begun to be seen as something vile in the developed world at the time of the civil war.  European powers had had legal slavery only decades before.  The condition of black people in any of these countries was tremendously poor.  I think we can agree on this.

I think it's important when we judge a state to do so within the context of history.  Ancient Rome had slaves, for example, and it was just as despicable a practice then as it is today, but we don't say that Rome was a despotic pariah state because slavery was legal there -- we understand that at the time, slavery was a common enough institution.  Those were different times.  That's not the same thing as condoning the behavior, understand.

The CSA, for better or for worse, had a government founded on the same principles the US government was founded on, and liberty, ironically, was the thing that many of the people who founded that government thought they were fighting for when they advocated secession.  As long as you weren't black, I don't think the CSA could be seen as despotic by any stretch of the imagination.  It wasn't a police state or a dictatorship or an autocracy.  It had a weaker federal government than even the US had at that time.  It was probably roughly equivalent to the United States in the late 18th century -- would you describe the US in the 1780s as despotic?

&gt; VERY much a technicality. In practice, they were fighting for states' rights, but the right that they cared about was the right to treat other humans like animals.

It was that, certainly, that was the catalyst -- the main thing the South and the North disagreed on was the institution of slavery.  At the time, the US was in expansionist mode, and new states were entering the Union with some frequency.  The real concern when it came down to it was that the South would become politically marginalized.  In the early days of the United States, the South made up fully half of the US, and had the political clout you would expect from that proportion.  As new states entered the union, though, that North/South distinction was being watered down by East and West.

The South *did* become politically marginalized, too, after the war.

&gt; Those parts of a cultural or national identity which aren't reprehensible are usually left alone, in practice.

That's not the least bit true.  Having your identity wiped away sounds like someone is doing it to you, but it happens naturally if you don't maintain a sense of identity for yourself.  For example, the Hawaiian identity is being wiped away.  Nothing reprehensible about the Hawaiians -- they're nice people with a rich and colored history.  But the influx of non-Hawaiians into their homeland, the ubiquity of mainland media, music, radio, and language -- these things have, over the course of generations, watered down Hawaiian culture to the point where Hawaiian as a language is not considered dead only because there is one island (Ni'ihau) where non-Hawaiians are not allowed to go.

Me: For example, AIPAC stopped US corporations ""control"" over Iran when they were their biggest trading partner for oil in 1996.

&gt;*You: Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.*

Me: Wall Street Journal
Jun 18, 1996

The measure, which the House is expected to approve today with the Clinton administration's blessing, infuriates some of the U.S.'s closest European allies. Last week in an undiplomatic outburst, the European Union's top executive turned to President Clinton during a joint news conference to complain that it wasn't ""justifiable or effective for one country to impose its tactics on another.""

But for Aipac, known formally as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the measure isn't just a way to fight international terrorism. It offers the chance for a comeback of sorts, a badly needed way to burnish its own image. Aipac isn't a political-action committee; it is the chief U.S. lobbying group for Israel and is financed by private fund-raising in this country.

Aipac staffers insist that it is business as usual -- they are working on Capitol Hill to promote Israel's interests. But the group's interest in Iranian terrorism at least partly reflects a recent dilemma. Over the past few years, Israel's active pursuit of peace with its Arab neighbors and warm ties with Washington made Aipac's mission less clear. The group no longer needed to mobilize its troops to thwart U.S. arms sales to Arab states or vilify Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Instead, American Jews were divided over issues such as the future of Jerusalem and the prospect of a Palestinian state.

""The consensus surrounding Israel has diminished and this, among other things, has reduced somewhat the centrality of Aipac in the American Jewish community,"" says Benjamin Ginsberg, a Johns Hopkins University professor who writes on American-Jewish politics.

Aipac's funk began in 1992 when Israeli voters elected the Labor Party's Yitzhak Rabin as prime minister, ending 15 years of dominance by the hard-line Likud bloc. On a visit here, Mr. Rabin met privately with Aipac's top leaders, many of whom are conservative and cozy with Likud. The new prime minister read them the riot act, gruffly telling Aipac officials that he would conduct foreign policy directly with the White House and that they should stay out of the way.

Shocked and searching for a way to remain relevant, Aipac hit upon the perfect vehicle -- Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. Since 1993, the New York Republican had been offering sweeping Iran sanctions bills. Despite the general animosity toward Tehran, the bills languished in Congress. Aipac recognized that all that was needed was an organized effort to refine the legislation and push it through. The lobbying group decided to become the locomotive.

When the Republicans took over Congress in early 1995 and Sen. D'Amato became chairman of the Banking Committee, the bill's fortunes -- and Aipac's -- were about to change. The administration regularly attacked Iran's support of international terrorism and urged its allies not to do business with Tehran. Then, thanks partly to an Aipac research paper shared with the White House, the administration learned to its embarrassment that **U.S. oil companies were Iran's biggest customers by far.**

In March of last year, to show its resolve, the White House intervened to stop Conoco Inc., the energy unit of DuPont Co., from going ahead with plans to help develop two Iranian oil fields. But casting the spotlight on Iran also gave Sen. D'Amato's bill momentum. Soon, the administration was conducting separate discussions with the senator's office and with Aipac.

Sen. D'Amato's bill focused on imposing U.S. penalties on foreign companies for trading with Iran. (The bill also includes sanctions against Libya, though Iran remains Aipac's principle focus.) But the administration, believing such a sweeping bill would violate international trade law, suggested another approach: it would punish foreign companies that in the future invested at least $40 million in Iran's energy sector, which is vital to its economy. The sanctions would include barring U.S. Export-Import Bank support on sales to those foreign companies and would ban such companies from receiving loans of more than $10 million from a U.S. financial institution. The administration hoped such an approach would be less offensive to America's allies. Aipac, recognizing the broader appeal of such a measure, signed on. So did Sen. D'Amato. The bill moved through the Senate with no opposition.

Next, Aipac prepared for a tougher fight in the House, where powerful interests traditionally oppose so-called secondary boycotts. In a world-wide campaign closely coordinated with Sen. D'Amato, Aipac and the New York Republican helped raise the stakes by publicizing pending business deals involving foreign firms and Iran.

In February of this year, for instance, the Australian Jewish Review published an article saying that Broken Hill Proprietary Co., Australia's largest company, was about to sign a $1 billion deal with Iran. A few days later, the Australian Financial Review's Washington correspondent wrote a similar report, including a letter to the firm by Sen. D'Amato. The company, under pressure, denied that such a deal was pending.

Meanwhile, the House International Relations Committee approved a bill that included certain trade sanctions and was tougher than Sen. D'Amato's measure. But GOP Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee that also has jurisdiction, strongly opposed trade sanctions.

With the two House committees at loggerheads, Aipac played the key role of go-between, sitting with Ways and Means staffers in the office of Thelma Askey, staff director of the panel's trade subcommittee, to try to resolve differences. In recent weeks, Aipac won support for a measure favored by the International Relations Committee that could lower the investment threshold to $20 million after a year if other nations don't agree to join the U.S. effort against Iran. But Aipac failed in efforts to extend sanctions to banks that finance energy deals in Iran. The Senate is expected to accept the House's version of the final bill.

Ironically, the recent election victory of Israel's hard-line Likud party, which is likely to stall peace talks, could create tensions between the U.S. and Israel -- and re-energize Aipac's basic mission. ""If Clinton tries to put pressure on Israel,"" says Morris Amitay, a former executive director of Aipac, ""he'll find that Aipac will be working with a lot of people in Congress, particularly the Republican majority, who will be happy to take on the White House.""

There is a tradition in Turkey of being a secular nation. That was one of Attaturk's main points in unifying the country after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Consequently, whenevery the government gets ""too religious"" the military overthrows the government and after the following election marches back to their barracks. Recently, the public voted in a far more Islamic government than has been done in the past, and instead of overthrowing it, the military has done nothing. Also, many of the instigators of what would be a coup - the ""deep nation"" have been themselves arrested.

1426066207,"The term ""Cargo Cult"" is specific to these islands, and stems from the natives magical thinking, and profound misunderstanding of the manufacturing process. It's actually consistent with sympathetic magic, wherein the cult members engage in ritualistic behavior in an effort to retake over the distribution of the cargo.

Towards that end elaborate rituals are repeated in a prime example of a gross misunderstanding of cause and effect.

To present it in its simplest form: The natives don't understand or can't conceive what goes into manufacturing the cargo, (anything that's modern, usually electronic gear, cars and planes etc.) without an understanding of Western manufacturing processes they are forced to resort to magical thinking.

In doing so, elaborate explanations and rituals are favored over any attempts to understand Western industrialization. The standard motif is that the Whites (Europeans) have somehow tricked the natives ancestors into producing the cargo, fully formed, put on planes, and delivered to the islands. The belief is that the natives ancestors are sending the cargo to the natives, but through magical manipulation  the cargo isn't going to its rightful owners, the natives.

In order to set things right sympathetic magic and rituals are constantly performed. The building of mock airfields with wooden radios and short runways are constantly manned and run in an effort to get the planes to land there and discharge the cargo to its rightful owners.

These rituals go so far as to mimic military units, with homemade uniforms and wooden rifles. A magical approximation of white society, and the necessary rituals invoked to return the cargo to its rightful owners.

John Frum (not a relative of Straussian scum David Frum) is thought to be pidgin English for John from America. Another magical attempt by the natives to reclaim rightful ownership of their property.

The myth posits that the natives are the actual Americans, again duped into their present position by the superior magic of the white-man. 

If the natives can be resolute in their magic rituals they can once again set things right, and get their version of heaven on earth. One in where they loll about all day while the white-man is once again forced to take his place in the bush, and live the life of an ignorant hunter gatherer. A kind of cosmic payback, a consistent theme in many religions.

The interesting thing is that the theme of a displaced people is a common one in religious thought. If you can find them online, Professor Jared Diamond has a three part series from his excellent book Guns Germs and Steel that takes an in-depth look at the Melanesian cargo-cults.

There is even a houseware and electronic junk pickup once a month. I have found a working printer, RAM, charger cables, sweet designer chairs from the 70s, bicycle parts. There are glass recycling containers everywhere.

&gt;Your most negative surprise?

GEZ - you have to pay 15€ a month if you have a TV/radio/computer. This is essentially a tax to help finance public broadcasting, like PBS. Although it is required, it seems most people don't pay it until they move into their first house, get kids and turn into squares. That's why I don't pay it.

Racism - Not just Germany but all of Europe. It's much more subtle than in the US. I think this is because of the history. Europeans slaughtered each other for a thousand years so it is understandable that they have developed strong opinions about the neighboring people that raped, murdered and pillaged each time they were passing through. People under 40 seem to be much more sensitive about it, but people over 50 will still probably use racial slurs for blacks, turks and italians. Europe didn't have a huge civil rights movement like America that made people more aware of what things mean when they say them. However, sometimes I think I might just be overly sensitive about it because I'm approaching it from an American politically correct point of view.

&gt;Any WTFs?

Flachspuler - toilets where when you take a shit, it sits there on a shelf ready for inspection until you flush it. I'm used to it by now, but every once in a while after dropping a particularly nasty deuce, I'm like, ""Dude, WTF!?""

Infatti molte sono le attrattive della location situate in gran parte attorno alla celebre Piazza del Campo, suggestiva per la sua forma a conchiglia. E’ una tra le più grandi piazze medievali europee ed è posta nel cuore delle 17 contrade cittadine, le cui antiche rivalità si riaccendono due volte l’anno in occasione del rinomato Palio. 
Il Palio di Siena coinvolge tutti i cittadini. Esso ha origini remote con alcuni regolamenti ancora oggi validi dal 1644, anno in cui venne corso il primo palio con i cavalli.
Il territorio della Città è diviso in diciassette Contrade con dei confini stabiliti nel 1729 dal Bando di Violante di Baviera, Governatrice della Città.
Ogni Contrada è come un piccolo stato, retto da un Seggio con a capo il Priore e guidato nella ""giostra"" da un Capitano, coadiuvato da due o tre contradaioli detti ""mangini"".

1426066445,"&gt;The Conservatives, in the middle of their annual party conference where they have so far focussed on cutting public spending, said they would repeal the Human Rights Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights to rebalance laws in favour of protecting the public.

&gt;Justice Minister Jack Straw defended the Human Rights Act, saying the names and addresses of offenders were already on the public record and police regularly named wanted criminals. He said he aimed to put information about offenders on neighbourhood policing websites this autumn.

I cant believe they have the balls to try this again.  I laughed my arse off when Cameron was on Paxman and said he wanted to repeal the Human rights act and Paxman asked him if he thought being chucked out of the EU was a good idea and Cameron looked blank.

Paxman had to explain to him that signing up to EU Human rights is a non negotiable part of being and the EU and that repealing it meant you were automatically chucked out (and rightly so).

He stammered something about coming to an arrangement with the rest of the EU and Paxman just slowly nailed him again by saying that every other nation that had tried (most recently Turkey wanted opt outs for things like women’s rights) had not even had the chance to discuss it.  It was NON-NEGOTIABLE.

Still, why embarrass yourself once when you can do it twice?

And on the whole offender thing: If someone is still dangerous they should not be released.  If they are not then you have no business naming them as they are the same as any other citizen.  So the only reason we would need to name them is if we are routinely releasing dangerous people.  That sound like a much bigger danger to me than the human rights act, which, I figure, I could probably take in a fair fight.

Most of them are not in the context of retaliation (unless you consider anyone who suggests that the qu'ran isn't the word of god to be attacking you, which a lot of vocal muslims do). More importantly these verses are used to incite violence which is tolerated by ""moderate"" muslims. The ever peaceful way in which you choose to interpret them has no effect on the people that use them to incite violence. Taken literally the verses can and are used to justify killing people. The closest reasonable interpretation of the intent of those verses is a violent one.

&gt;Supporting slavery is a no-brainer in the 7th century.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGiCuFQM2Vo 
Different religion same principle. If god felt the need to order women to cover their heads surely he could have chimed in on slavery being immoral and unacceptable. 

&gt;Subjection of women? Not sure what that means but the Quran reformed Arabs' attitudes towards women and gave them actual rights (to hold property, to inherit, to have a say over their marriages which were all arranged by male guardians, limited Arabs to 4 wives when they'd have dozens, gave them the right to expect full spousal and child support rather than just be part of a harem like slaves (free women were treated like slaves), and banned female infanticide (still a problem today)). These were all instituted centuries ahead of Europe.

That's nice. Unfortunately muslim women are treated like shit today and Islam is used as justification. It is true that the qu'ran gave women some rights but it also says that they are inferior to their husbands and must do whatever they say. In the Islamic religion men and women are not equal. No reasonable interpretation of the qu'ran could suggest god wants men and women to have equal rights.

&gt; 1) How was your overall experience of Phd?

I loved the first two years of my PhD. You get a lot of freedom to explore stuff. The last 2 years was a lot tougher. There is a lot of pressure to get papers published. But papers always get rejected at least once and so you have to rewrite them again and again.

There is also a lot of pressure to do a bad job. Doing a quick prototype is a lot better than a full-blown implementation, because you get the research out faster.

But I don't mean to make it sound bad. I really loved it. I'm just going to love not doing it for a while.


&gt; 2) How many years you took to complete it and whats your current age?

My PhD took 4 years. I've been working on PHP/[phc](http://phpcompiler.org) full-time for 2 years, part-time for 2 years before that. I tried doing some research with gcc before that, which went nowhere.

An Irish PhD is typically 3 years. In practice, they take at least 4 years. The average in my department is 5.5 years. This is changing to 4 years by default, with classes etc. So more like the American or European model. Also, my funding was only for 3 years, so the last bit was particularly hard.

&gt; 3) All I read in compilers is that dragon book, any other books or references you can give to a noob like me which actually help to get me started with designing the compiler?

I hate the Dragon Book. Its not very readable. I don't know why they spend so many pages on parsing. I love the Cooper/Torczon book and ""Programming Language Pragmatics"". I quite like the Appel book.

To give you advice, go work on an open-source compiler. Do some bug fixes for gcc or LLVM or phc or unladen swallow. Work your way in from there.

1426066650,"Thankyou, and, because you appear open minded here is a little more 'fodder' to look up if you wish so you can **make up your own mind**, impartial and honest to my reckoning:

  There are two other aspects that should be addressed.  First of all you said the British set up Israel.  Again, not quite, post world war two - when both sides Palestinian Muslims and Palestinian Jews had both broken into factions either supporting the British during the war, remaining neutral, or actively attacking British forces.  This continued even after the war had ended.  In lieu of this the British handed their responsibility of mandate powers over Palestine to the newly formed UN.  It is important to note now that a UN General Assembly resolution is non-binding outside resolutions that effect only the General Assembly itself (so they can set GA protocol, budgets, etc. but nothing international or outside their assembly), only a UN Security Council resolution is binding.  The GA passed a resolution that the Palestine issue *could* be resolved by forming two states...countries voted on it as an idea.  They then passed this resolution to the Security Council to receive ratification to make it binding - so they could go and do it.  The Security Council returned the resolution unratified, they had no jurisdiction to break up an independent country and they knew that doing so would create security issues.  This is when Israel declared its independence.  So when people say the UN or the British formed Israel they are flat out wrong.  The Jewish people of Palestine had a war of independence off their own backs and won - that's what established Israel as a state.  Morally it might not have been right (those fighting for Israeli independence where largely immigrants from Europe forced on Palestine), but legally any country can break up and components declare independence.  That's where we stand.  

The second argument is that in 1967 a state of play was established and hostilities brought to an end.  Many *Israelis* consider this the point where Israel shifted from being justified as a country in self defence to an aggressor.  Zionism was the movement to set up a state of Israel.  Those that think Israel won its independence and settled in 1967 believe anything beyond 1967 borders is an affront.  They don't identify Israel as being a religious state but hold a civic identity.  What makes Israel is that they identify with being Israel, not just that they are Jewish.  Jewish rights and protection is afforded in Israel to end centuries of persecution but that Israel is not a Jewish state no more than it accommodate the prevention from persecution of other races, cultures and religions.  This political perspective is called [Post Zionism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_zionism).  They are represented traditionally by the likes of [Yesh Gvul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yesh_Gvul), Israeli intellectuals, and the many humanitarian groups active in Israel.  They acknowledge Zionism, the setting up of Israel, but they consider that it ended when Israel agreed borders in 1967 and now they identify with Israel itself and not religious biblical argument which goes on to claim lands as far as Lebanon and Iraq ,which used to be called the Greater Kingdom of Israel over two millennia ago (and then only for a brief period of time).

Just as America understands how [NeoCons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-con) differ from traditional conservatives or Republicans, Israel has the same thing.  [Neo-Zionists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Zionism).  Zionists who support the state of Israel but believe, support a higher claim on religious grounds.  They identify Israeli identity with being Jewish - not just an Israeli citizenship.  They believe in a Bush doctrine of fighting the offensive out of the belief that they will always be attacked at home if the foot is taken off the pedal.  Neo-zionism is the rightwing authoritarian belief that justifies extending settlements, pushing for war with Iran (Shia Persia and Sunni Arab states have a power balance - remove one side of the balance and Arab states are allowed to address Israel without maligning their Shia muslim populations.  In effect the power balance shifts to Israel v Arab states and not Israel as the outsider.  Shia Hamas and Hezbollah are more easily addressed as an Arab problem not an Israeli problem).

Neo-Zionism and Neoconservatism have similar but different goals and a common way of achieving them.  They aspire to regional hegemony to promote themselves in the 21st century.  The Israel lobby in Washington empowers the Neocons just as much as Neoconservatism empowers and fights for Neo-Zionism.

You need not be anti Israeli or antisemitic to condemn Israeli action.  Just as people when they condemned the Bush administration saturated in neocons weren't necessary condemning America or Americans only the current policy.

I also called recently to cancel.  Wasn't calling to play games; just wanted to drop it as I'd just picked up an Ooma box.  I was on the $25 unlimited plan w/ the $10 ""Call Europe"" option to get free calls to Turkey.    With a few calls to cell phones that option didn't cover, plus a truckload of taxes, my monthly bill was consistently right around $50. 

They first offered to move me to their just-announced $25/month ""Call World"" plan, which would have saved me the cost of the $10 option package.  But I knew about that already, and taking me from $50 to $40/month was still way more than what I expected to pay for Ooma.

Then they offered me a $15/month option, and I forget exact details, but it had some limit to it that was pretty much a no-go given my specific international calling pattern, and I think it was for a limited time.

Finally they offered to just cover me for 60 days, i.e. no phone bill for 60 days.  Presumably they now assume I really am serious, and so are making a Hail Mary pass that a chunk of customers will just forget to call back and cancel again in 60 days, or maybe changed their minds.

Since I'm pretty good at remembering that stuff, I took this offer.  We'll see what they offer when I call back then.

p.s. For those that haven't heard about Ooma, I recommend checking them out.  Call quality has been fine.  For those that haven't heard, Ooma's (questionably sustainable) business model is to sell you a $200ish box upfront, but then you get domestic phone service for free forever.  For international, you pre-pay, and their prices are very competitive for me.  Only quirk is that I'm not sure how sustainable there business model is.   They need a chunk of users to sign up for their $10/month premium option for economics to work out, and they recently re-drew the line between free &amp; premium services to exclude voice mail from free accounts, though they grandfathered that in for existing subscribers, so it looks like they're following through on the ""the stuff that was free when you signed up stays free"".  Only exception was directory assistance calls are now 99¢, but that's because they get charged for that, and they suggested GOOG-411, which is free for that anyway, so I'm thrilled.

No. The punishment is _torture_ by UN, US, British and EU definitions of the word torture. Theres no 'if' or 'but', it _is_ torture and fully meets these definitions of torture.

According to the [American Academy of Pediatrics](http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/pediatrics;103/3/686) (keep in mind that circumcision is currently a [prevalent religio-cultural tradition in the U.S.](http://circumstitions.com/Docs/KNMG-policy.pdf)):

&gt; Existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision; however, these data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision.

About the specific items you listed:

&gt; **Decreased risk of urinary tract infections. The risk of urinary tract infections in the first year is low, but these infections may be up to 10 times as common in uncircumcised baby boys. Severe infections early in life can lead to kidney problems later on.**

That's the relative risk; consider the absolute risk, as discussed by the AAP:

&gt; Data from Europe, based on a largely uncircumcised population, report UTI rates of 1.2% for infant boys.73 The number is similar to the rates of 0.7% to 1.4% reported for uncircumcised males in the United States and Canada.72,74  In comparison, UTI rates for circumcised male infants in the United States and Canada are reported to be 0.12% to 0.19%.72,74  Although these cross-cultural data do not provide information on specific individual risk factors, the similarity of European and American UTI rates for uncircumcised male infants support an association between circumcision status and UTI. Using these rates and the increased risks suggested from the literature, **one can estimate that 7 to 14 of 1000 uncircumcised male infants will develop a UTI during the first year of life, compared with 1 to 2 of 1000 circumcised male infants.**

*UTIs are RARE!*

Almost all UTIs are quickly eradicated with simple antibiotics, which are much cheaper and much less invasive than subjecting *healthy* infants to genital-reduction surgery.

Consider [these numbers](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/): 

&gt; Wiswell's sensational statistic, that circumcision resulted in a ""ten to hundred times decrease in urinary tract infections in circumcised boys,"" has often been quoted; however, it is misleading. In fact, UTIs are so rare in any case that, using Wiswell's data, 50 to 100 healthy boys would have to be circumcised in order to prevent a UTI from developing in only one patient. (Using more recent data from a better-controlled study, the number of unnecessary operations needed to prevent one hospital admission for UTI would jump to 195.49)

According to [netdoctor.co.uk](http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/menshealth/facts/urinaryinfection.htm):

&gt; UTIs are rare in men, so all cases require investigation.

*Did you ever pause to think about the other sex in this case?*

According to a [Scandinavian study](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/)):

&gt; girls and boys have about the same incidence of UTI in the first year of life. Girls have a four times higher incidence of UTI in the first six years of life than non-circumcised boys.

and according to [netdoctor.co.uk](http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/menshealth/facts/urinaryinfection.htm):

&gt;  UTI is 50 times more common in women, with about 5 per cent per year developing symptoms.

&gt; UTI is uncommon in men below 60 years of age, but the frequency is similar in men and women in older age groups.

and according to [emedicine](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/231574-overview):

&gt; adult women [in the U.S.] are 30 times more likely than men to develop a UTI.

Good Lord!

*Where's your argument for messing around with female genitals? After all, it's been noted that removing the labia and clitoral hood reduces smegma and enhances hygiene.*

Just think about that for a while.

&gt; **Occasionally, the foreskin on an uncircumcised penis may be difficult or impossible to retract (phimosis).**

There are [2 types of phimosis](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/777539-overview) (also, [see here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ahawi/i_am_an_uncircumcised_21_year_old_who_never/c0hkc5g)):

* **Physiologic**: When boys are born, their penises are immature; the foreskin is fused to the head of the penis (ripping them apart is the first step of neonatal circumcision).

* **Pathologic (genuine problem)**: The foreskin becomes unretractable after it was already retractable; this usually happens because the preputial orifice (the ""opening"") becomes scarred and therefore too inelastic.

According to a [2-year study](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119091453/abstract): 

&gt; The incidence of pathological phimosis in boys was 0.4 cases/1000 boys per year, or 0.6% of boys affected by their 15th birthday

Ooooh! Big Problem!

It gets more interesting, though:

&gt; \[which is\] a value... exceeded more than eight-fold by the proportion of English boys currently circumcised for 'phimosis'.

That means a lot of boys are being circumcised for a condition they don't actually have.

Sadly, American doctors have been traditionally ignorant for most of the last century about *physiologic* phimosis, so many boys have been wrongly diagnosed with *pathologic* phimosis and subsequently referred for circumcision unnecessarily.

Worse, it's been the advice (until the near past) of numerous American medical organizations and child-rearing resources that parents forcibly retract the foreskin in order to prevent the normal adhesions of physiologic phimosis. However, this forcible retraction rips the foreskin from the head of the penis, which can result in scarring that induces *pathologic* phimosis; the wounded foreskin and head can actually heal together again, which is why it was advised to perform this forcible retraction at each washing, thereby compounding the problem.

Furthermore, many legitimate cases could probably be resolved with a few months of stretching (perhaps with steroidal ointment). Surgically, preputioplasty is popular in Europe and MUCH less invasive than circumcision.

Did you know that women get phimosis too? Their clitoral hoods are too tight to allow their clitorises to engorge fully and they can similarly suffer from infections as a result.

&gt; **This can also lead to inflammation of the head of the penis.**

This is called [balanitis](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/balanitis/), and it occurs in circumcised males as well; it can be caused by excessive washing (especially when an abrasive soap is used), suggesting that over-zealous parents might be causing some portion of cases.

&gt; **Decreased risk of penile cancer. Although cancer of the penis is rare, it's less common in circumcised men.**

Again, look at absolute risk.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (same link):

&gt; Cancer of the penis is a rare disease; the annual age-adjusted incidence of penile cancer is 0.9 to 1.0 per 100 000 males in the United States.\[91\]  In countries where the overwhelming majority of men are uncircumcised, the rate of penile cancer varies from 0.82 per 100 000 in Denmark\[92\] to 2.9 to 6.8 per 100 000 in Brazil93  and 2.0 to 10.5 per 100 000 in India.\[94\]

&gt; ...

&gt; An annual penile cancer rate of 0.9 to 1.0 per 100 000 translates to 9 to 10 cases of penile cancer per year per 1 million men. Although the risk of developing penile cancer in an uncircumcised man compared with a circumcised man is increased more than threefold, it is difficult to estimate accurately the magnitude of this risk based on existing studies.

There is evidence that the ""benefit"" of circumcision in the case of penile cancer is only conferred to men circumcised in infancy, and there is a strong link between HPV infection of the penis and penile cancer. Therefore, it's pretty clear that preventing penile cancer (already an extremely rare disease) is really a matter of preventing a sexual disease that is known to cause cancer: Then, why not use the much cheaper and far less invasive approach of pushing safe sexual practices, WHICH MUST BE DONE ANYWAY.

&gt; **Decreased risk of sexually transmitted diseases. Safe sexual practices remain essential, but circumcised men may have a slightly lower risk of certain sexually transmitted diseases — including HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.**

Please [see here](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/9rvgf/pascals_wager_again_quite_a_nice_comic/c0e5kjy).

In particular, note:

* [This recent 30-year study in New Zealand](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18280846?dopt=Abstract) reported results that are ""consistent with recent population-based cross-sectional studies in developed countries, which found that early childhood circumcision does not markedly reduce the risk of the common STIs in the general population in such countries.""

* [In this recent study out of South Africa](http://www.aidsmap.com/en/news/23862073-490F-44F5-AC5E-17893A3764BA.asp) modeled various means of preventing HIV, and made the following conclusion about circumcision: ""We were surprised by how little effect it had""; condoms and treatment availability were forecast to be 20x more effective and cheaper. And that's where the HIV prevalence is [11% overall (16% in some parts and upwards of 30% in some age groups)](http://www.avert.org/safricastats.htm)! How much of an effect would circumcision have in the U.S. where the prevalence is *0.6%* (of sexually active adults)?

* Of the 0.6% of sexually active U.S. citizens who are infected with HIV, *over half* are men who have sex with men (gays/bisexuals), for whom circumcision has been shown to be useless in a number of studies. A large chunk more of HIV positive individuals are users of intravenous drugs. **The point is that there is a very narrow population that is at risk, so it's insane to target the general population of infants who won't be having sex for nearly 2 decades.**

1426067624,"&gt;What does the EU make?

Well the technical answer to that, if the Treaty of Lisbon is passed, will be 'nothing'.  The EU will be a legal entity in its own right exclusive to its member states.  Pro EU guys probably won't like that but there it is.  Of course the Union won't project that, it'll claim the produce of its member states as being hers - as it will their citizens.  But what Europe makes and exports is actually quite considerable:

- Airbus based in Toulouse, France, produces half the world's airliners.

- Allianz headquartered in Munich, Germany, by revenue is the largest financial service provider in the world.

- AirFrance-KLM, Paris, is the largest airline by revenue and for passenger mileage in the world.

- The CIA worldfact book has the EU as the world's number one exporter.   

- Not only are the EU states ranked number one in the world for exports when treated as a single entity the US only comes fourth.  Germany in its own right comes in second.

- France, Italy, Holland and the UK, all EU states, all also appear in the top ten of world exporters contributing to EU exports.  Their exports include: *machinery, vehicles, chemicals, metals and manufactures, foodstuffs, textiles, aircraft, plastics, chemicals, pharmaceutical products, iron and steel, beverages, tobacco; other minerals and nonferrous metals.  Textiles and clothing.  Electric power equipment, automation equipment, railroad equipment, shipbuilding, electronics and communications equipment, chemicals, coal, petroleum, paper and paper products, food processing.*

- The world's largest steel company, ArcelorMittal, is in Luxembourg. 

- The Belgians really know their beer.  They have the largest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev.....*in the world* [/clarkson voice]

- Largest cosmetics and beauty company?  L'Oréal.  Y'up Europe makes women beautiful.  Now *that's* an export.

- The largest mobile phone company, Nokia, is Finnish.  Apparently the Finns make more phones than anybody else.

- According to Fortune magazine the largest company in the world is joint British-Dutch.  Hint: their logo is a [shell](http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/global500/2009/snapshots/6388.html). 

- Sweden has the world's largest paper and pulp producer alongside the Finns.  Stora Enso, a joint endeavour. 

- You can't get away from the fact when they make something they make it well. Any everyday consumer product and right at the top and recognised as being amongst the best you'll see a definitive European product. Be it German engineering dominating the luxury car market, Italian engineering capturing the supercar market, French wine, Italian fashion houses, Scottish whiskey, Spanish brandy, Palma ham, Greek honey, Welsh lamb, British music, Belgian beer,....,...

- as of recently EU member states have 347 Nobel Prize winners, more than anybody else, making them arguably the greatest exporter of intelligentsia. Europe is a veritable art, science and culture powerhouse.

""Libertarian civilizations on earth."" - Israel is incredibly AUTHORITARIAN!  Even in the recent election one of the fore running candidates wasn't allowed to be shown on campaign posters in certain neighbourhoods...because she was a woman!  That's not a libertarian society by any means.  You may only travel on some roads if you are Jewish.  There are marital law issues which discriminate, building rights are withheld.  Israel is actively conducting a programme of ethnic cleansing.  The coalition kingmaker, Avigdor Lieberman is a fascist.  He's also now the foreign minister and deputy leader as well as heading the uber nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu.  Israel's not libertarian.  It's incredibly authoritarian.   In fact so anti-libertarian is it the foreign minister ran on a campaign of 'no loyalty, no rights'.  Or more appropriately ['no loyalty no citizenship'](http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1062611.html).  You criticise the state and it crushes you.  That's not libertarian.  Read that link, it even refers to legit Jewish Russian immigrants fearing being shut down by other aspects of Israel and so feeling forced to vote for the authoritarian right.  At least its not authoritarian against them is the thinking.  Libertarian doesn't come into it.

&gt;""I wasn't going to vote this year but now my husband says we have to vote for [Avigdor Lieberman], otherwise they [Shas] will shut us down,"" she said, referring to the Soviet-born head of Yisrael Beiteinu.
""It's true we don't sell pork here but I'm from Russia and that might be enough [to close us.]"" Like many Russian-speaking Israelis, who number over a million, she understood the harsh words from Shas's spiritual leader as an insult to an entire community.

1. Aliens seem to be evolutionary archetype where the old mysteries of the stars are mixed with our evolutionary fear of reptiles. Reptiles beeing the most primitive large land animals. Snakes carry poison that can kill with one bite and can move faster them most mammels. Think of Ourobouros or Quetzalcoatl present on every continent way before 1492. According to recent data from University of New Mexico hallucination of aliens are produced almost everytime someone consumes DMT. Dimethyltryptamine(DMT) a naturally-occurring tryptamine and potent psychedelic drug, found not only in many plants, but also in trace amounts in the human body where its natural function is undetermined but probably responsible for dreaming could  explain alien abduction phenomena. Terence McKenna the father of the 2012 new age theories (with John Major Jenkins, Daniel Pinchbeck and Frank Waters) sadly concluded that alien has disguises himself  as a psychadelic experience http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh7Uv556xZQ.

2. Beliefs in extraterrestrial life may have been present in ancient Babylon, Assyria, Sumer, Egypt, Arabia, China, India, and South America, although in these societies, cosmology was often associated with the supernatural, and the notion of alien life is difficult to distinguish from that of gods, demons, and such. Aliens appear in modern culture with Edgar Rice Burroughs H. G. Wells Jules Verne etc as a fusion of 19th C. astronomy, mars, moon... observations and the Invasion Literature http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_Literature 
At the time of the publication of The War of the Worlds the British Empire was in its most aggressive phase of expansion, having conquered and colonized dozens of territories in Africa, Australia, South America, the Middle East, South East Asia, and Atlantic and Pacific islands. It was one of a number of European empires, whose competition to conquer other nations eventually lead to the First World War.[12]

While Invasion Literature had provided an imaginative foundation for the idea of the heart of the British Empire being conquered by foreign forces, it was not until The War of the Worlds, that the reading public of the time were presented with an adversary so completely superior to themselves and the Empire they were part of.[31] A significant motivating force behind the success of The British Empire was its use of sophisticated technology; the Martians, also attempting to establish an empire on Earth, have technology superior to their British adversaries. In writing The War of the Worlds, Wells turned the confident position of a reader in the British Empire on its head, putting an imperial power in the position of being the victim of imperial aggression and thus perhaps encouraging the reader to consider the nature of imperialism itself.

Wells suggests this idea in the following passage from the novel:

And before we judge them [the Martians] too harshly, we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon animals, such as the vanished Bison and the Dodo, but upon its own inferior races. The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European immigrants, in the space of fifty years. Are we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?
—Chapter I, ""The Eve of the War""

This also challenged the Victorian notion of there being a natural order, in which the British Empire had a right to rule through their own superiority over subject races.

Religion was still the ""center"" in European life, he saw the French revolution, the overthrow of the concept that God gave certain men- kings- the right to rule.  Christianity was a worldview like Libertareanism, Neoconservatism, or Communism are today- it had armies.  The inquisition wasn't history, it was still going on in some places.  Russians were still keen on throwing ""kill all the jews in town"" parties.

Our modern ""personal relationships with god and the bible"" are only possible because of the political overthrow of Christianity in the west.

A couple things to consider:

Personally, I plan to make traveling a part of my life; take two or three weeks a year and get lost.  I'll never be looking back on the best times of my life as I'll never be too far from my next venture.  This method is also much more workable into the American 'work work work' lifestyle.

* Are you going alone or with others?
My last trip was 2 months in central Asia with a good friend.  I've also done a couple weeks on my own in Europe.  Both were great.  My only advice here, travel with in smaller groups.

* How long do you have to travel?
If you have tons, circumventing the planet is doable; if not, conquer an area.

Finally, if it's a possibility, switch into a career that moves you around the world.  This will allow you to mix business with travel.

1426068064,"Sure. There are fixed costs for broadband (and for wireless, and for electricity), and those fixed costs are probably a much bigger portion of the cost of broadband than of wireless. Regardless, I'm sure of three things:

1. The marginal cost of bandwidth to Comcast (etc.) is greater than zero, due to electricity costs, backbone costs, support costs (dealing with users who complain about slow access), etc.
2. Comcast's current price structure means that the more bandwidth a user uses, the less money they earn on that user.
3. If Comcast instituted data metering, and if the price for data was high enough that high-bandwidth users became *more* profitable rather than less, then Comcast would do everything in its power to get its users to use *more* bandwidth. VoIP blocks, torrent throttling, artificially low speed caps, etc. would become a thing of the past, because they just wouldn't be profitable.

Of course, Comcast could still do semi-evil things like having a ""basic"" plan which is cheaper but charges 10x as much as normal for torrent bandwidth. But this is just simple [price discrimination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_discrimination), and in the absence of more regulation or more consumer choice, there's not much we can do about that.

*edit:* As far as the boonies go, this is the same reason that many people give for not privatizing the post office. In both cases, the real solution is to view it as a negative externality. If we want to encourage more infrastructure investment in rural areas, then the government should subsidize it. For example, wireless providers could pay a lower tax rate for income earned on accounts in low-density ZIP codes.

Personally, I think that density in the US is far too low as it is, and if this kind of pricing scheme could make US urban cell phone networks as good as those in Europe and Japan, I'm all for it, even if the boonies get left out. :) But that's just my opinion, and I'm sure that many people feel differently.

PLEASE SHARE BROADLY--LET'S SEE HOW BIG AND FAST OUR IMPACT CAN BE

We need your help. We are sitting in the glare of the President's Cup PGA Golf Invitational, offering one of the largest and most accessible conferences to both our students and the public on Ethnic Studies and advances in education and social justice, and we are being obscured by a media whiteout across the street at Harding Park. We need you to ask your favorite media – today--to come across the street to S F State. Please include our website in your note http://www.sfsu.edu/~ethnicst/fortieth.html. 

The most promising media contacts seem to have only one question that they find news worthy: Are you going to have a fight with those who think Ethnic Studies should not exist? They ask this as if the most important issue in the lives of people of color is paying attention to those who would have us exterminated, or entertaining people with our pain and struggles. 

We are addressing the education of our children, healthy environments for our families, preparing a new generation to becoming successful citizens, providing green jobs and making the nation more equitable for all people--but this, we are told, is not news. Their explanation is that they give their audiences what they want. I ask, is that the news you have been asking for? 

The biggest stars at Harding Park this week will be a man of African, Asian and Indian American heritages who is dominating the sport, the youngest man on the course--a man of Asian heritage-- an African American former basketball star and a president of African and European heritage, all of whom in my childhood would have been blocked from playing at Harding Park or even attending the PGA, and I am not nearly as old as that observation might indicate. Ethnic Studies and the struggle for social justice are absolutely relevant to how this moment in their lives—the “news”—came about. 

The Big Request--One small act; One big impact

 If you read news online, if you engage in social networking, if you like to call into news ask some simple and critical questions, ask them to address a question that you would like to know about and that the experts gathered at S F State can address. Here are only a few possibilities. 

1) How did golf become integrated? How did we get to Tiger? 

2) How did we get to having an African American President who will make history when he walks across the golf course at Harding and why is it important? 

3) How is it that the game of golf, dominated now by players of color shows no comparable change in its leadership; and, what would it take to produce that next level of change in the game?

4) Why is it when people of color are involved in violence, tragedy, embarrassment or entertainment we are news, yet, when we are engaged in achievement we are not?

5) Why are civil rights and social justice activities the most multiethnic activities but least likely to be shown visually on television? 

Or,

1) Do you know what is probably the largest cultural holiday that originated in the United States is (Kwanzaa) and who originated it (Dr. Maulana Karenga)? Did you know he was across the street from Harding Park at S F State? 

2) In a nation and a world that is perplexed by the relationship of Christians, Muslims and Jews, particularly as it relates to the current wars and security issues around the world, do you know where one of the highest concentrations of experts from each of those ethnicities exists at a single university? Across the street from Harding Park at S F State. 

3) Do you know where the Black Student Union in the 1960's created a coalition with ""third world"" students, white students (TWLF), labor and educators and organized the longest student led strike credited with an instrumental role in integrating universities and improving the quality of their curricula around the nation. Across the street from Harding Park at S F State. 

4) Do you know which university still has one of the largest and most powerful collections of Ethnic Studies Scholars? Across the street from Harding Park at S F State. 

5) Do you know what one of the most powerful predictors for improving the health, reducing crime, insuring successful youth and stimulating economies is? Accessible public education, come learn about it across the street from Harding Park at S F State? 

6) Do you know what the most common recommended intervention for stopping aggression on the streets or in wars between nations is? Mutual understanding and respect, come learn about it across the street from Harding Park at S F State? 

Ask your media outlets to come across the street from Harding Park and give you some news you can use. 

Please, do this in the spirit of Ethnic Studies, that is, think progressively. We are not looking to disparage the historic moment that will see Misters Woods, Singh, Yang, Jordan and Obama inspire youth of color around the globe. To the contrary, we only wish to link them to the social movements and academic opportunities that truly produced this opportunity for them and are still producing the same for others. With all due respect, the PGA did not improve the conditions of people of color or working class and poor white people. Progressive people of all colors did improve and revitalize the game of golf, while it made even more substantive improvements in the lives of all Americans. Setting the record straight will improve the quality of everyone’s lives. What’s news to you? Tell your favorite media outlet, today, to go across the street from Harding Park and find out what is happening right now at S F State. Thank you.

They just changed the music and added the [Ruductio ad Hitlerum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_Hitlerum) at the end.

The truth is that these issues are more complicated than they are portrayed. If this upsets you, then go read up on it in neutral sources (not conspiracy sites). 

The Cold War was horrible, and many proxy battles were fought, many terrible things done; but at the end of that war the USSR was destroyed and it's enslaved satellite states released, their isolation lifted. China opened to the West - albeit slowly- as a result of its ""communist"" neighbor's downfall. 

An argument could be made that the Cold War was hell, but these terrible things were done to defeat the Soviets. Much worse could have happened if they were allowed free reign around the world; socialist leaders sending raw materials back to the USSR and China was a very real danger. Things like the Cuban Missile Crisis were only the publicized battles. 

Even though looking back we feel disgusted by what was done in our names (the ""Free World"" lead through the Cold War by the Americans being 'us') we must realize that these choices were not made in a vacuum. And yes, perhaps they were necessary, as vile as that sounds.

No one said: ""we must install dictators around the world and fund terror"". They said: ""we must topple those who would widen USSR influence in the world and if we must train and supply rebels - no matter their terrible ideology - we must do it; we must do it to stop the greater evil of the USSR from enslaving the world"".

It is much like WW2 - we firebombed Dresden, we dropped Fat Man and Little Boy, we allied with Russia. As a result of these and other terrible actions we defeated the Axis, but who could say these things were not horrors? We gave up Eastern Europe to avoid war with Russia, we allowed the Chinese Civil War to wage after WW2 rather than help rebuild the Republic of China. 

It is unknown what the alternate history present world would have looked like if these battles had not been fought. I think that these proxy battles (and that is what all these were) had to happen one way or another. The isolation and strangulation of the USSR and their allies' resources lead directly to the world as we know it. We must remember this when we condemn the past.

Progressive vaccinia (vaccinia necrosum) occurred only in persons who suffered from an immune deficiency. In these cases the local lesion at the vaccination site failed to heal, secondary lesions sometimes appeared elsewhere on the body, and all lesions spread progressively until – as was likely – the patient died, usually 2–5 months later. As vaccination ceased in most countries prior to the emergence of HIV/AIDS, the consequences of the currently much larger pool of persons suffering from immunodeficiency were not reflected in recorded cases of progressive vaccinia.

Generalized vaccinia occurred in otherwise healthy individuals and was characterized by the development, from 6–9 days after vaccination, of a generalized rash, sometimes covering the whole body. The prognosis was good.

Postvaccinial encephalitis, the most serious complication, occurred in two main forms. The first, seen most often in infants under 2 years of age, had a violent onset, characterized by convulsions. Recovery was often incomplete, leaving the patient with cerebral impairment and paralysis. The second form, seen most often in children older than 2 years, had an abrupt onset, with fever, vomiting, headache, and malaise, followed by such symptoms as loss of consciousness, amnesia, confusion, restlessness, convulsions and coma. The fatality rate was about 35%, with death usually occurring within a week.

The best estimates of the frequency of these complications come from a 1968 study conducted by the United States involving over 14 million vaccinated persons. Altogether nine deaths occurred.

Progressive vaccinia occurred in 11 persons, with 4 deaths.

Eczema vaccinatum was more common, with 74 cases and no deaths. Sixty additional cases of eczema vaccinatum occurred in contacts of vaccinated persons, with one death.

Generalized vaccinia occurred in 143 cases, with no deaths.

Encephalitis was observed in 16 persons, with 4 deaths.

On the basis of this study, it was estimated that approximately one death per million resulted from complications following primary vaccination and one death per four million following revaccination.
Further information on the duration of protection following vaccination

How long does immunization remain effective – a lifetime or only a certain number of years?

This is difficult to answer with great precision, as all available data come from the time prior to the global eradication of smallpox, which was certified in 1979. When smallpox was still occurring naturally, populations in endemic countries were exposed to the virus. In some countries, subclinical infection with the virus occurred rather frequently among vaccinated persons, thus boosting their immunity.

Edward Jenner, who developed the vaccine in 1798, believed that successful vaccination produced lifelong immunity to smallpox. That view was clearly wrong.

Data from the eradication campaign make it clear that immunity wanes with time. This is why, prior to the certification of eradication, periodic revaccination was recommended, for example, for international travellers. For the general population, revaccination at a 5–10-year interval for non-endemic countries and at a 3-year interval for endemic countries was recommended. In certain high-risk groups requiring maximum protection, such as staff working in smallpox diagnostic laboratories, revaccination every year was recommended by WHO as a precaution.

Vaccination five years prior to exposure provides a high level of protection against smallpox. High levels of protection are generally believed to last 10 years after vaccination. Beyond this 10-year interval, where the evidence of protection is strong, the data are conflicting and difficult to interpret. Some studies found some degree of protection against smallpox for as long as 30 years after vaccination. However, other studies demonstrated very little or no immunity 20 years after vaccination. A large study, published in 1913, found substantial protection even in persons, vaccinated as children, aged more than 50 years.

One study of smallpox following the importation of cases into Europe and Canada (1950–1971) showed that mortality was 52% in unvaccinated persons, 1.4% in those vaccinated up to 10 years before exposure, and only 11% in those vaccinated over 20 years before exposure. For the age group of 10–49 years, the mortality rate was 49% in the unvaccinated and 4.3% in those vaccinated 20 years earlier.

What age groups would need to worry about vulnerability to smallpox if an outbreak occurred today?

Smallpox eradication was a global campaign, and populations were protected by vaccination in every country. However, during the campaign, different forms of smallpox occurred, and different vaccines and vaccination techniques were used. The duration of protection can be influenced by the potency of the vaccine and the inoculation procedure used. These factors make it difficult to give firm, precise estimates that are relevant today, where populations no longer have widespread immunity, either from vaccination or from having survived the disease (patients who survived smallpox were immune for life).

Another factor that makes it difficult to make projections today based on historical data is the much larger pool of persons suffering from weakened immune systems. This can be because of immune disorders, therapeutically-induced immunosuppression, as in the case of chemotherapy, or clinical AIDS. A person's immune status affects both susceptibility to infection and the risk of adverse outcomes following vaccination.

Immunization stopped in many countries, such as the US, in 1972. In 1979, WHO recommended that vaccination against smallpox be stopped in all countries, the only exception being special groups, such as researchers working with smallpox and related viruses. By 1982, routine vaccination had been officially discontinued in 149 of the 158 member countries of WHO. By 1986, routine vaccination had ceased in all countries.

It is particularly important to understand that when vaccinated persons nonetheless contracted smallpox, the illness was usually considerably milder than that seen in unvaccinated persons. We know from experiences in early 19th century Europe, when natural smallpox was still widespread, that when the disease appeared in adults who had been vaccinated as children, the mortality rate was much lower and the symptoms were different and milder than in unvaccinated persons. Patients also appeared to be less infectious and thus less likely to spread the disease to close contacts. This would certainly affect the dynamics of a smallpox outbreak today all over the world, where the vast majority of adults were vaccinated as children.

Vaccination also influenced the frequency of different clinical types of smallpox among persons who did contract the disease. Among vaccinated persons who subsequently contracted the disease, a mild form of smallpox (modified-type smallpox), which was hardly ever fatal, was much more common.""

1426068650,"I'm seconding what [**perb123**](http://www.reddit.com/user/perb123) said.  As experienced dog owners, we raised a Briard, and were surprised by how challenging it was.  We were given bad training advice from a professional trainer, and with that, combined with being traumatized by a bigger puppy at her echoey, noisy puppy training class (seriously), we ended up with a seriously fear-aggressive dog.  With us, he was fantastic:  Briards tend to be extremely intelligent and autonomous, which is part of the difficulty raising them, but one of the things that make them wonderful to own.  However, we had to be very careful when we had him out in public.  Like many European wolf-fighting dogs, Briards automatically try to intercept any hand coming overtop of their heads; with us this would just mean teeth closing on our hand for a moment, but for strangers, it meant that no, they could **NOT** pet the nice doggy.

Let me pause for a moment to exault the virtues of the Briard.  They are fast.  Very fast.  They are good scenters.  They are very solicitous and protective.  They tend to be either watchful or extremely playful, qualities observable from puppyhood.  They have very cute ears.  They have the most enormous mouths and teeth.  They love snow (so much that, his first spring as a puppy, ours would go and sit sadly on the last snowdrift).  They are huge (the North American lines I'm familiar with, at least:  wikipedia says 'medium sized dog' which is simply untrue) and amazing and intelligent.  They will come trotting home without Billy, go to the shed, get some rope, a flashlight, and a hardhat, and trot back to the well.  They are the narwhals of the Alps.  Inside each one beats the heart of William Wallace behind the sunglasses of David Caruso.

However, if the notes about a breed say that it is for experienced dog owners, **take that seriously**.  This dog, as it moves from puppyhood to adulthood, will test you and defy you and attempt to dominate you.  There will be teeth.  If the breed notes mention 'needle-sharp baby teeth' then **there will be blood**.  **Frequently**.  If it thinks that you can't take care of yourself, it will make decisions for you.  These decisions will be better suited to the herding of sheep than to, say, human law, or stuff like that.

Don't even waste your time trying to educate them.

Missile defense is an interesting subject because it has nothing to do with missile defense. There was this great interview on PBS awhile ago with some general (I'm sorry I can't be more specific) about why people (Russia in particular) are upset.

Its been over 60 years since we've had a world war, and while people may through around a lot of reasons the biggest is that the next world war is going to be the last. MAD has kept the cold war from boiling over simply because both sides new direct action would be suicide. At the same time missile defense is only possible against a limited amount of missiles, one of the reasons both the US and Russia have an insane amount of weapons. Missile defense is only really reliable against those limited numbers (which is why we're saying its for protection from Iran), so if you think there is a threat you need to take out as many missiles as you can first.

For these reasons the ""defense"" aspect is kind of a misnomer. By eliminating MAD we get the ability to wage war on a global scale again, and more importantly (at least as far as Russia is concerned) this raises the viability of the US launching, and surviving, a first strike. Thats what missile defense ultimately boils down to- a first strike weapon. Its for these reasons there was worry about an arms race- if we get missile defense, then Russia will want to as well, not to mention both countries working to overcome their counterparts defenses.

The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be, on any pretence, raised in the United States. A military force, at the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power.""

Errrhh... lolwut
Classical Greece has absolutely nothing to do with the Byzantine empire. 

&gt; That Greek exists as a language to even speak right now is testament to the fact that Empire existed. They would have long since been mowed under by the various expansionist dynasties in the Caliphate had the Byzantine Empire not existed.

That's not true the fact that language and culture has survived isn't proof of any thing. What a bizarre argument srsly. Also it's complete and utterly irrelevant. What the fuck does this have to do with this discussion?

&gt;Secondly, no proper historian so dismisses the Islamic Caliphate, which lasted 1300 years, over several dynasties, and which almost took Europe on two occasions as lasting a short time. That Caliphate lasted nearly as long as the Roman Empire/Republic did.

Genghis Khan destroyed Baghdad in 1258 but decline had set in long before then the golden age of the Islamic world was only for about the first 2-3 centuries after that hardly any scientific and cultural advances where made. 
Why you would need to drag the ottoman empire in this I have no idea...

&gt;Yes, both polities

What both polities are we talking about? 

&gt;but those weren't the seeds that started the Renaissance, were they? It was the WESTERN church, exerting influence over WESTERN Germanic leaders like Charlemagne, that revived Europe.

You do know that Charlemagne died about 6 centuries before the Renaissance even started eh? 

You are talking about the Carolingian renaissance
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_Renaissance
A very small and very short revival that confined itself mostly to clergy and hardly inspired anything but whatever. 

&gt;I didn't assert this at all. I asserted only two things:
a) They copied the texts.
b) We owe them a debt of gratitude for doing so.

But why do you then 'cringe' when people say that we would have been better off without them? We could have done much better then just preserve a few scarce texts here and there.

Aside from both speaking Greek, ruling over the same peninsula, being ethnically identical, and the fact the Byzantines were derived from Rome, which was derived from ancient Greece, you mean?

If the Byzantine Empire doesn't exist, then the Christian bulwark that kept the numerically superior muslims in the Islamic Caliphate at bay for a thousand years doesn't exist.  Constantinople was the staging ground for most of the Crusades and it was requests from beseiged Byzantine emperors that got the west involved in those crusades in the first place.

&gt; Why you would need to drag the ottoman empire in this I have no idea...

Yeah, yer a historian, you are.

The Seljuk Turks were non-religious and raided both the Byzantines and the Caliphate at will.  Both regions tried to convert them to their respective religions and/or buy them off, and the Abassids eventually did so.  As a result, those Turks became Muslim and when Ghengis did his thing to the Abassids, who do you think slipped into the vacuum?  The Ottoman Dynasty was the last dynasty in the Islamic Caliphate.  They invaded the Byzantines and ultimately took Constantinople for good in 1453.  That dynasty became the Ottoman Empire with those conquests and it wasn't until they were beaten at the gates of Vienna in the mid 1600s that the Islamic threat to Europe was stopped.

That's why I include them.  The CHRISTIAN Byzantines fought off the ISLAMIC Turks.

&gt; What both polities are we talking about?

The Byzantine Empire and the Islamic Caliphate.

&gt; You do know that Charlemagne died about 6 centuries before the Renaissance even started eh?

Sure, but unless you are truly daft, you know that the Holy Roman Empire he founded lasted down to 1809, in one incarnation or another.  You'd also know that the Carolingian Renaissance was the direct genesis for the founding of Europe's earliest university at Salerno and that the revival that started resulted in the church founding several more over the next five hundred years.  Yes, that dastardly church founded many of Europe's oldest universities with the Greco-Roman classics forming the bulk of the curricula.

&gt; We could have done much better then just preserve a few scarce texts here and there.

And there was every opportunity to.  Was there something stopping those warring Germans from hoarding away those texts themselves?  I mean, they did rule over Rome directly, right, and had access to dozens of libraries holding the bulk of Greco-Roman scholarship.  Too bad those supposedly secular chieftains were too busy fighting to learn to read much and so more or less let them rot while they warred for supremacy.
