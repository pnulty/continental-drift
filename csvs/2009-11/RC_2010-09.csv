It's curious that you didn't find anyone that speaks English. There are loads of English speakers in the more residential Asian side's urban centers, and also in the European side, if you were to ask a random young person walking down the street, at a central location, I'm almost 100% sure they'd speak English.

Istanbul's traffic is something it shares with many big cities, but yeah. It does seem pretty chaotic for an outside eye. You adjust to it, in time. :)

&gt; I might add that I actually bought a Qur'an while in Istanbul - partly as a souvenir for being in (almost) the middle east, and partly because I want to understand our differences.

I gotta tell ya, the Turkish brand of Islam is nothing like what you will find in that book. Yes, I'm an atheist, but even if I weren't, my opinion would likely be the same. Take this into account while you read. ^^ 

Many of us, who identify themselves as Muslims are [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Muslim), and not [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim).

I hear Beirut, Kuwait, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Cairo and Tel Aviv &amp; Jerusalem are very nice destinations to go to if you want to experience the ""modern"" middle east. I've been to Dubai, it was like a city-wide construction site, but observing the people / social dynamics was amazing.

The main male lead is reluctant to marry the girl of his dreams because, being older, he knows she will change and become restless because of her youth.  They eventually marry about halfway through.  I won't spoil the ending but the message was that people change, including yourself, over time and if you are not willing to accept or plan for these changes, then your life will be a disaster.  

Western women have it drilled into their minds that they need to find everlasting love in their soulmate and that every guy in between are casualties that earn them things.  Some of them, even those in their 50s, never learn that the kind of love you desire changes as the years go by.  However, Western women cling to that idea that they should feel the same amount and kind of love they felt at twenty 20 years after being married.  It is a perverse thought that leaves the Western world full of women who are unsure how to satisfy their basic emotional desires of all ages.  Women can be married early and live happy, rich, and fulfilling lives if both parties accept that things will change and don't let the relationship become stagnant. 

Edit:  I would like to add a simile.  It is like a grown man refusing to let go of his childhood toys.  He clings to the feelings of the past and we as a loosely defined culture ostracize and mock him, not without good reason as well.  Why can't we do the same with women and love?  Why don't we mock them for expecting the same lovey dovey stuff they felt as a teenager as an adult?

And before this even comes up, I am not advocating women settle with any guy she meets and ""loves"" on the chance they will stay together.  Finance and the man himself should be judged based on his ability to be a supporting husband/father but the money has become the driving point of marriage in our society rather than the want of raising children with input of both parents or supporting each other.  

Also, about those advocating marrying foreign women, that idea only works up to Eastern Europe until cultural views make it a worse gamble than marrying a local woman.  All the ideas we have about marriage are Western and women from different cultures view marriage differently.  I don't want a completely submissive woman who answers my every beck and call.  I could manage that for a much lower cost by hiring a maid and a prostitute.  I want some kind of bond that says my life partner will stay and we will change through the years together, influencing each others change in positive ways and that the woman I decide to have children with won't steal them away in the night and then demand money from me.  I can find that here even though it is extremely rare but foreign women (I assuming foreign meaning non-European dominant powers) will often marry out of obligation and for security, the only difference being they want your money their entire lives instead.  A woman like that would probably not consider me as the ""father"" in the idealized Western version I want.  I am the wrong generation to look for soulmates right now and it doesn't look like the spoiled women of today are teaching their daughters any better. 

 I can only pray that I can find a good woman before I turn 35 or I will just pay for an egg and have it artifically inseminated and put in a surrogate mother.  An extremely costly procedure but one I could guarantee would allow me to shape my children into the people I would want them to be.  I would pay the same price I would pay for a modest house for a half clone.  In the end, it might be the safest and cheapest of the two options.   Much better than being a ""weekend warrior"" (No offense to the men forced into this situation).  My dad is and has been there my entire life to support me when I am weak and then toughen me up when I can stand on my own two feet as well as my mother.  It has been a major part in helping me become what I am today and I will damned if I can't do the same or better for my children. ",,1426446722,0,8,8

The most interesting variations of Spanish, IMHO, are the [Argentinian Spanish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina#Language) and the [Peruvian Spanish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peruvian_Coast_Spanish). Argentina had a higher concentration of European immigrants than the rest of the Latin American countries and Peruvians have a very strong Native American component.

As to white Mexicans not looking like pure Europeans— Why do you assume that ""European"" means ""Northern European""? Brown hair, brown eyes and olive skin are far, FAR more common in Europe than blond hair and blue eyes. Not just in the Mediterranean, but in the Balkans, Serbia, Albania, Greece, pockets of Northern Europe [like the Saami in Scandinavia or the Welsh in England]. You have tons of dark hair and olive skin from absolutely 100% pure Europeans. Blondism is the variation, the genetic anomaly. The dark type is the far older paleolithic type, and is the original type from which the fair type is a new adaptation. (By most estimates, it's only about 6,000-10,000 years old. In other words, a blond European like Rutger Hauer is the ""new type,"" whereas the olive-skinned, dark haired type like Catherine Zeta Jones is the old type which goes back 50,000 years in Europe.]

So, ironically, Mexico's Gael Garcia Bernal is far more representative of a ""generic European type,"" statistically and historically than some albino from Denmark.

&gt; Set in the early 1800s, the story follows Hercule Barfuss, who is born deaf, dumb and grotesquely misshapen, with a ""dark red cavity"" for a face, in a German whorehouse. But he has a gentle, intelligent nature and a budding gift of telepathy, which reveals people's innermost, unacknowledged desires. Reared in the brothel, Hercule forms a deep bond with a beautiful girl, Henriette Vogel, who was born there the same night he was. After the loving pair is tragically separated at age 10, Hercule traverses Europe—living in a Jesuit monastery, an asylum and with a traveling freak show—persecuted everywhere as he seeks out Henriette. Along with Hercule's relentless search for Henriette, it is a sadistic cardinal's pursuit of Hercule (""a demon"") that propels the novel. The book unravels, though, when Hercule, warped by hardship, embarks on a vengeful rampage.",Dresden Files,1426446927,0,1,1

&gt;As for the African slave owners being more lenient. ""While African slaves did grueling labor on sugar and cotton plantations in the Americas, European Christian slaves were often worked just as hard and as lethally – in quarries, in heavy construction, and above all rowing the corsair galleys themselves.""... “We have lost the sense of how large enslavement could loom for those who lived around the Mediterranean and the threat they were under,” he said. “Slaves were still slaves, whether they are black or white, and whether they suffered in America or North Africa.” 

What exactly is your point again?  Blood spewed out of my eyes halfway through that quotation.

&gt;There are more slaves today than at any other time in human history

Numerically.  Not proportionally.  Half of all slaves today seem to be from Asia.  And regions in Africa, like Sudan, have lots of slavery(often along ethno-religious lines, eg muslims enslaving Dinkas and the like).  Eastern European countries like Moldavia also are riddled with human (sex) trafficking.  

I'm curious, did you get the ""There are more slaves today than at any other time in human history"" line from a book called *A Crime So Monstrous*?  If so, then you presumably read the part where Skinner qualifies that he means only numerically, not proportionally?  

I went and looked at your comments' history, to see if I could discover some kind of vague racism, but I didn't find that.  I found something much more confusing.  You've brought this subject (non-Western slavery) up several times.  You seem to be on some kind of strange crusade.  

You say that 'white' people just happened to be the most successful at what everyone had been trying to do ... but isn't that something in itself?  I wouldn't disagree that other cultures besides Europeans would (and some would still like to) do the things Europeans did but Europeans are the ones who actually did it.  I don't know if you're playing up to some cry of 'unfairness' or not, but fair doesn't really matter on this one.  We (peoples of European descent) are part of a heritage that have been performing a series of extraordinarily evils.  If things had turned out different, maybe others would have played that role.  But it's not inconsequential that we're the ones who actually did it.  

Pointing at others and yelling, ""they did it too!  they did it too!"" doesn't justify anything.

No, I have never read that book.  

No, Europeans are not the only ones who did these things. Slavery was on every corner of the earth.  Expansion for gain is as old as history and took place from Asia to Africa to the Native Americans.

Have you not read about Genghis Khan?  You do know that he had the largest land empire in history and conquered, raped and killed many South East Asians, and Europeans?  Youve read about Zulu right?  He killed millions of Africans expanding his empire.  Mayans, Incas, etc who used neighboring tribes as slaves and human sacrifice.  The facts are the West is not the unique perpetrator of *""a series of extraordinarily evils,""*  these evils were performed by every culture and peoples on earth.  Nazi's were bad.  Please read about the Japanese during the same time period...they were just as bad and had the same superior race ideology.  The Roman empire did conquer others...but much after the Persian empire conquered and subjected most of their known world.  The Goths (Germanic tribes) were a ruthless band that smashed through other cultures..,but they never matched the ruthlessness and expansion of the Huns (Turkish tribes).

Obama will always have my vote for having the stones to pass something in this area. Unfortunately, many concessions were made to make the bill politically feasible (which it still almost wasn't). Everyone left-of-center in the U.S. (right-wing extremists for European readers) likes to focus on obvious short-comings, like the lack of a public option, or the exclusion of illegal immigrants. 

Valid criticisms, to be sure.

&gt;
&gt; From then on, Fernandez said, there were no more cartoons on the television.
&gt;
&gt; “We had two channels: no American cartoons. ‘Long live free Cuba’ became ‘To the wall!’-executions. You were either with the revolution or against (the country),” she said.
&gt;
&gt; Fernandez said the Cuban Revolution was supposed to resolve social problems, but that no improvements occurred.
&gt;
&gt; “All institutions were systematically destroyed, soon followed freedom of the press and expression,” she said.
&gt;
&gt; Even though Fernandez was not aware that Castro was her father until the age of 10, she said he often visited her mother in the evening.
&gt;
&gt; ”(He was) the man who one night stepped out of my TV and into my living room. He offered me a doll disguised as him, a bear with a green hat and beard,” she said
&gt;
&gt; Fernandez would later deny her relation to Castro to Cubans who came seeking aid, hoping that Fernandez could relay a message to the seat of power.
&gt;
&gt; “You must be in real desperation when you’re hoping a child can solve your problems,” she said.
&gt;
&gt; Instead of solving the problems of the people, the revolution only put more people under the scrutiny and control of the government, Fernandez said.
&gt;
&gt; ”(The government) controlled the press, mail and phone lines so you couldn’t communicate with other countries until AT&amp;T changed that in 1994. If you tried to do something to improve (your life), you were sent to jail,” she said.

So his own system is what stopped him finding out what was happening.

Che Guevara was in charge of La Cabana prison where dissidents were executed and commented - ""To send men to the firing squad, judicial proof is unnecessary. These procedures are an archaic bourgeois detail."" 

And yet idiots still walk around with Che T Shirts. Che compares very unfavourable to Bush on pretty much any metric apart from telegenicity - 

http://www.asdfpolitics.com/chebush.html

&gt; Che Guevara was a racist. Regarding Mexicans, in his book The Motorcycle Diaries, Che Guevara stated that “Mexicans are a band of illiterate Indians”. Regarding blacks, Che stated “The Negro is indolent and lazy, and spends his money on frivolities, whereas the European is forward-looking, organized and intelligent.” He also stated “We're going to do for blacks exactly what blacks did for the revolution. By which I mean: nothing”. George W. Bush was not a racist. Regarding Mexicans, on several occasions Bush bucked his own party and supported what many saw as legalization for millions of illegal aliens [10, 11]. Regarding blacks, George Bush gave billions of dollars to Africa to fight AIDS and malaria, as well as to build hospitals and schools. His Emergency Plan for Aids Relief is credited as having saved two million African lives by “providing antiretroviral drugs to HIV-positive Africans”

...

&gt; Che Guevara helped establish Cuba’s forced labor camp system, to imprison those “who have committed crimes against revolutionary morals” [4]. Although the camps were not directly intended for homosexuals, they were targeted more than others [5]. AIDS victims were also another common target of those put into labor camps [6]. Cuban socialist author Guillermo Cabrera Infante believed that Che ""considered homosexuals to be sick people who must give way to the politically healthy 'new man' made by communist Cuba."" [7]. George W. Bush supported civil unions between same sex couples, but he opposed gay marriage and supported a constitutional amendment that would restrict marriage to being between a man and a woman [8,9].

To be fair, look at the other extreme. In Western Cultures such as in the USA (where I'm from) and many European Countries, the massive scare for pedophilia and sex abuse has gone insane. For example...

* A man photographing his own kid in the UK was badgered by others thinking he was a pedo.

* Recently turned 18yo teenage boys are put on sex offender lists for fucking their 16-17yo girlfriends of many years.

* Teenage girls (under 18) are charged with possession of child pornography for having pictures of THEMSELVES!

* Teenage guys/girls (under 18) are charged with possession of child pornography BECAUSE they received texted pics of underage teens.

* Hysteria at a park over a what was thought to be a pedo stopping to look at kids in a park turned out to be a frequent jogger stopping to catch his breath and timing. 

* Recently, a young girl (posted somewhere on the site) drown in a river because passers by were afraid of approaching a child out of fear they would be seen as a pedophile. 

As a male in my late 20's confronted with a kid who lost his parent(s), I have a predetermined procedure. I would vocally call out to those around me saying the kid is lost, I would call the police/security stating my information and location, and I would stay within a desired distance from the kid. We no longer live in a society where a random stranger is willing to take the hand of a lost child to find their parents. Doing so could land you in jail out of blind hysteria. ",,1426447247,0,9,9

The statement about conservative values being found in rural Turkey is more there to illustrate the fact that -in my opinion- there are more differences between secular, modern Turkish people and their rural counterparts than there are between a secular modern Turk and a secular modern Swede or German.

Since all the aforementioned countries have a substantial portion of their territory and in some cases their population as well, outside of these boundaries I think the argument to include them in the EU based on ""cultural"" grounds would be a bit tenuous since it would open the door to something equally ridiculous like Canada being allowed to join the EU based on its quote-unquote European cultural heritage.

Bullshit.  First of all, there are thousands of GMOs, so how did they test them all with 81 studies?  The answer is they didnt.  The studies were not specifically testing the safety of any of these products, but were much more broad based, and were not specific to safety at all.

The author simply takes a fact out of context, puts it in, and expects that morons will take his word for it that GMOs are safe.   It obviously worked.

&gt;Characterizing Sense about Science as a pro-GM lobbying group is an ad hominem attack, one that avoids the arguments set forth. Merely because the position on that topic (among many discussed by SAS) differs from yours shows no 'bias.'

Considering he didnt put forth any argument, but rather gave his opinion with virtually no facts to support it, there wasnt anything else to discuss about his article.  The fact is that author would not be considered impartial by any means.  He is the one who claims GMOs are safe because of ""81"" tests, which is obviously false to anyone who has any idea about the scientific method.  

There are plenty of other, actual respected scientists who claim we need more testing of GMOs, and that the companies that produce them do not allow scientific testing to occur.

http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/wanted_gm_seeds_for_study

Here we can see that actual scientists, working for universities, have petitioned the EPA to state that they do not feel they are allowed to research GMOs.  I guess they should just shut up about it, because after all, there have been 81 tests done and everyone agrees GMOs are safe, right?

Here is an actual, unbiased scientist, who has specific claims that GMOs may not be safe, and require more testing

http://www.actionbioscience.org/biotech/pusztai.html

If you had done any research at all into GMOs, you would probably recognize his name.  Pusztai was fired from his research position after publicly reporting that the GM potatoes he was testing showed were not the same as normal potatoes.

There was giant scandal, and eventually his paper was peer reviewed and published, and his findings were vindicated.  You probably didnt hear much about it, because these events were hardly mentioned in the US press, although it was a major story in Europe.

Also for too long any criticism of Islam met with such a furious response for example the Danish cartoon saga or Rushdi's fatwa that it was almost seen as a no go area. You go too far in one direction and its inevitable that some people right after are going to go too far in the other.  Even if as the writer suggests Sarrazin might get 10% of the vote for his extreme views that leaves 90% who wouldn't. In the UK a policy of hidden and fairly vast immigration blew up into strong local support for the BNP, a quasi fascist group in some working class areas but once that issue was finally openly acknowledged by the mainstream parties such support for the BNP faded away.  
But Muslims havent always helped the situation. Muslim women in the UK when they first arrived from say Bangla Desh, did not wear veils until about ten years ago more and more of them started to almost as a fashion.  People began to notice this not surprisingly and of course it seems threatening and alien. Muslim fundamentalists stoked this fire.  In 1982 in Saudi Arabia for example Western Women just had to wear clothes covering arms and legs when going out,  by 1997 it was essential for women to wear total black overcovering if they didnt want to get pretty nasty attention. A middle aged lady I knew was screamed at in the street for wearing lipstick. In a sense this is the inevitable backlash.  Tolerant and moderate Muslims have to stand up against the  fanatics. its just hard when the fanatics run the country where Mecca is located.

Are you insane. This law specifically gives the state the power to put women in jail for wearing something you don't like.

&gt;I've realized that the law's intention has more to do with advancing Muslim women in French society than it does with trying to create a prison state.

The law's intent is neither one of those. The law's intent is to demonize muslims and to deliver a message to them that they are not welcome in the society any more.

&gt;The intention of the French govt. is not to put all Muslim women in jail

No that's a means to an end. See above. The intent is to deliver a message to muslims. We know where this train ends up. European history is... Well european history. 

&gt;They want to use the threat of a short jail sentence (which is the maximum penalty) to force Muslim men to allow their women to dress more freely.

Why would the men feel any pressure. They hate their wives and want to torture them and treat them sadistically by making them wear clothing you don't approve of. How would jailing their wives hurt them?

&gt;It remains painfully obvious that you have not spoken to ANY Muslim women about this topic, because if you had, you would realize that many Muslim women feel imprisoned in their burqas everyday.

As I said. Not one of them told me they wish some country would throw them in jail for wearing a burka.

&gt;You are correct though, the French govt did step in with a law that can be seen as supressing civil liberties,

BAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
  
""can be seen as""

BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

&gt;but the fascism that you claim to be arguing against is directly enabling the domestic fascism that Muslim women are subjected to everyday in their private lives. 

Oh yes. Let's institute state fascism to combat ""domestic fascism"".

That will end up well.

&gt;Think of it as the healthcare mandate in Obama's healthcare bill. The maximum punishment is a small jail sentence for not buying health insurance

&gt;-- en.wikipedia.org, wonderfully clear.

without bothering to include what immediately precedes it:

_This article is about the general concept. For the religious sense, see Religious belief. For other uses, see Belief (disambiguation)._

makes your statement disingenuous, to say the least. Why would there be a disambiguation page for Belief if it was wonderfully clear? I know of no one who thinks ""belief"" can refer only to religious propositions. In fact if you ask someone directly ""do beliefs relate only to religion?"", they might catch themselves about to say ""I believe so"".

Look, I'm sorry, I didn't know you were in Germany. Are you a native English speaker? You speak it very well and I had assumed you were. In fact your use of ""fare better"" instead of ""fair better"" in this post probably indicates your accuracy is better than 90% of the native English speakers on reddit. Of course it's still possible that this is a cultural difference; maybe people don't say things like ""I believe we'll have dinner at seven"" in Europe.

You seem to be stating that the word ""belief"" is applied to science and religion the same way, and this is simply not true. Scientific beliefs are guesses which can be dropped or modified as new information comes along. Religious beliefs seem to be based, essentially, on wishful thinking.

Your point about global warming is an excellent example of this fundamental difference. ""There's nobody in my circle of acquaintances, nor theirs, probably three deep, who is qualified to judge whether the published opinion of the IPPC is correct."" This may be true. It's possible, however, for you to obtain and thoroughly study the source information and educate yourself as to the context information. Granted, this may take awhile; the specialization of disciplines is certainly in your way. In some period of time, long or short, you can understand this information as well as any member of the IPCC, and probably better than some. Not only would you be qualified to understand fully, you might actually contribute new insights.

Contrast this with religious beliefs. Should you so choose, you can attend, say, Catholic seminary, and study, say, ""the mystery of the Trinity"". One of the big problems the Catholic church faces is the dropout rate from their ""professional"" schools. A major contributing factor to this is the discovery each student makes, upon examining the source material closely, listening to lectures, etc., of the amount of supposition, presumption, the lack of credibility, and the metaphorical nature of what is taught to run-of-the-mill members of the ""flock"" as, well, gospel.

It does not require faith to state that you don't know. This is the most important statement in science. If atheists ""hate to have this pointed out"" that it requires faith to ""believe"" in science, well, maybe that's because they're tired of pointing out that it's not true.",,1426447358,0,1,1

You don't really want folk to know that you don't know where Berlin is etc. (Hint, Capital of Germany, in the North East of the country). And British History is complicated, my advice to you a) read Wikipedia articles of European history from 1900-&gt; (i.e. the world wars, and cold war, and how it affected us), and British history as far back as, I'd say Henry VIII which is about 1500. b) If you're genuinely interested in the history of these islands, watch Simon Schama's A History of Britain.

Basically, yes hide the fact that you have little international knowledge. Note this is not really your fault, you were taught American history and geography and could probably tell me every single important event on American soil since 1770 and before.

SAVE. YOUR. MONEY.  London is crazy expensive.  Hopefully you've been doing this already.  Yes, there are bargains to be found, but with the exchange rate/traveling expenses, you want as much money as possible.

RyanAir is your friend.  Cheap, cheap, cheap flights, no-frills airline based in Europe.  Take as much as you can in a small backpack/suitcase and then you won't have to pay to check luggage either!

Get a raincoat.  Yes, it rains a lot there.  I also recommend taking Vitamin D, because the lack of sunlight can get to you (I wish I would have done this--I spent much of my time depressed).

TRAVEL.  Go wherever you can, anytime that you can.  This may be your only chance to travel as much as you want since you don't have a shitload of responsibilities (UK schools are low on homework).  Go to Italy, go to France, go to Germany, wherever!!  Stay in student hostels.  No, it's not like the movie, they're actually (usually) pretty cool.  Read reviews of said hostels to find the best one.

Explore!  Do the touristy stuff, but also just take time to walk around the city and find what it has to offer!  You can find some of the niftiest things that way.  Stables Market (Camden Market) is a must.

There is almost no homework.  This being said, GO TO YOUR CLASSES.  Majors in UK schools are specialties, not general like in our schools.  If you're taking philosophy classes or something, you might feel behind.  Just go to class, read what they tell you to read, and DO THE ESSAYS EARLY.  I knew so many people who were stuck the last week we were there because they put off writing their 10-page essays to the last minute.

The food is not terrible, despite popular belief.  It's actually pretty good.  That said, cook for yourself much of the time.  This will save you a lot of money.  

Get an Oyster card.  This will be your best friend.  Works on buses and the Tube.

Does anybody know the comparison he's making between the execution of Iraqi hostages and the execution of the Italian prime minister in 1978?

 Some of my favorite points:

&gt; Evangelical atheists never doubt that human life can be transformed if everyone accepts their view of things, and they are certain that one way of living - their own, suitably embellished - is right for everybody. To be sure, atheism need not be a missionary creed of this kind. It is entirely reasonable to have no religious beliefs, and yet be friendly to religion. It is a funny sort of humanism that condemns an impulse that is peculiarly human. Yet that is what evangelical atheists do when they demonise religion.

. 

&gt;A curious feature of this kind of atheism is that some of its most fervent missionaries are philosophers. Daniel Dennett's Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon claims to sketch a general theory of religion. In fact, it is mostly a polemic against American Christianity. This parochial focus is reflected in Dennett's view of religion, which for him means the belief that some kind of supernatural agency (whose approval believers seek) is needed to explain the way things are in the world. For Dennett, religions are efforts at doing something science does better - they are rudimentary or abortive theories, or else nonsense. ""The proposition that God exists,"" he writes severely, ""is not even a theory."" But religions do not consist of propositions struggling to become theories. The incomprehensibility of the divine is at the heart of Eastern Christianity, while in Orthodox Judaism practice tends to have priority over doctrine. Buddhism has always recognised that in spiritual matters truth is ineffable, as do Sufi traditions in Islam. Hinduism has never defined itself by anything as simplistic as a creed. It is only some western Christian traditions, under the influence of Greek philosophy, which have tried to turn religion into an explanatory theory.

.

&gt;In today's anxiety about religion, it has been forgotten that most of the faith-based violence of the past century was secular in nature. To some extent, this is also true of the current wave of terrorism. Islamism is a patchwork of movements, not all violently jihadist and some strongly opposed to al-Qaida, most of them partly fundamentalist and aiming to recover the lost purity of Islamic traditions, while at the same time taking some of their guiding ideas from radical secular ideology. There is a deal of fashionable talk of Islamo-fascism, and Islamist parties have some features in common with interwar fascist movements, including antisemitism. But Islamists owe as much, if not more, to the far left, and it would be more accurate to describe many of them as Islamo-Leninists. Islamist techniques of terror also have a pedigree in secular revolutionary movements. The executions of hostages in Iraq are copied in exact theatrical detail from European ""revolutionary tribunals"" in the 1970s, such as that staged by the Red Brigades when they murdered the former Italian prime minister Aldo Moro in 1978.

.


&gt;The influence of secular revolutionary movements on terrorism extends well beyond Islamists. In God Is Not Great, Christopher Hitchens notes that, long before Hizbullah and al-Qaida, the Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka pioneered what he rightly calls ""the disgusting tactic of suicide murder"". He omits to mention that the Tigers are Marxist-Leninists who, while recruiting mainly from the island's Hindu population, reject religion in all its varieties. Tiger suicide bombers do not go to certain death in the belief that they will be rewarded in any postmortem paradise. Nor did the suicide bombers who drove American and French forces out of Lebanon in the 80s, most of whom belonged to organisations of the left such as the Lebanese communist party. These secular terrorists believed they were expediting a historical process from which will come a world better than any that has ever existed. It is a view of things more remote from human realities, and more reliably lethal in its consequences, than most religious myths.",,1426447466,0,12,12

Be careful with this word unless you are sure you are not committing fallacy yourself. If one claims that more than 50% of Jews in Israel originate from Arab countries, a more appropriate question in US would be to ask how many American presidents were white, since whites are a majority in US. How many females were presidents makes sense in any country, and has nothing to do with ethnic/tribal/descent groups in that country.

&gt; Here's a short, incomplete list that serves as a partial answer.

Either this list is very incomplete, or Jews that originated in Arab countries are severely underrepresented. 

&gt; You are aware that the link you just gave there says that there are 3,000,000 Mizrahi Jews in Israel, right?

The article says:

""Together Mizrahi, and Sephardic Jews number over 3,000,000 people in Israel today, with hundreds of thousands more having mixed Ashkenazi herritage due to Jewish cross-cultrual intermarriage.""

I said:

""In any case, about 70% of today's Israelis are born in Israel, which indicates very high immigration, most from Europe/America.""

RusskiJewsski said:

""Again wrong. The fact that 50% of all israelies are the descendants of jews from arab countries proves it.""

Read the article carefully. It does not say that 50% of Jews in Israel come from Arab countries. The 3000000 figure covers all Jews of non-Ashkenazi descent, many from non-Arab countries. Arab != Muslim.

Anyhow, I quoted the article to show that 30% of the Jews living in Israle today are first-generation immigrants, most from Europe. Do you think that the article does not say that? ",,1426447482,0,-1,-1

I see it as a huge problem that SC2 is incredibly popular.

Personally, despite Activision removing LAN support, after watching a friend play SC2 I decided I was just going to bite the bullet and buy it. Of course, when I dug a little deeper and found out that SC2 locks you into the region you buy it in, and charges significantly more for the game in Europe and Australasia whether you buy a physical or digital copy, I changed my mind.

There were three things I really loved about Starcraft &amp; WC3 that Activision have ruined. Playing LAN, playing against friends in the U.S. and elsewhere, and playing custom maps, which with SC2 are no longer stored locally and can be denied by Activision for any reason at all.

More examples of people who are mixed or multi-race. In reality, every Black person in America whose ancestry dates back to slavery is most likely mixed race. Hence the term ""American Black"".

I am a different complexion from both my mother and father, who have completely different complexions from each other.

Lime Creek Road is about 8 miles.  Would you pay $30 to drive it just to have one-way traffic and barriers up?  For $300 you can get two hours of seat time with an instructor, in a safe environment, with people who have at least a little instruction (and a car safety inspection).

You have no way of knowing who is around you, what their skill level is, or how they will react to passing other than the social contract of a blinker when you venture onto the Nordschliefe.  If you have an off, your insurance won't cover you.  If you bend the Armco barrier, they expect to be paid before they let you leave.

Some of the bits would go beyond what I would personally write without attribution. I won't make any claim as to who inspired who.

Article:
&gt; However, the big problem that impeded further expansion of this imperial outpost was the supply of fresh water.


&gt; Ascension was an arid island, buffeted by dry trade winds from southern Africa. Devoid of trees at the time of Darwin and Hooker's visits, the little rain that did fall quickly evaporated away.

&gt; Egged on by Darwin, in 1847 Hooker advised the Royal Navy to set in motion an elaborate plan. With the help of Kew Gardens - where Hooker's dad was director - shipments of trees were to be sent to Ascension.

&gt; The idea was breathtakingly simple. Trees would capture more rain, reduce evaporation and create rich loamy soils. The ""cinder"" would become a garden.

&gt; So, beginning in 1850 and continuing year after year, ships started to come. Each deposited a motley assortment of plants from botanical gardens in Europe, South Africa and Argentina.

Wikipedia:

&gt; However, further expansion was hindered by lack of freshwater. The little rain that did fall quickly evaporated away as the island was devoid of trees. Inspired by Darwin, in 1847 Hooker advised the Royal Navy to set in motion an elaborate plan, that with the help of Kew Gardens, shipments of trees should be sent to Ascension. The plan was that trees would capture more rain, reduce evaporation and create rich loamy soils. The ""cinder"" of an island would become a garden. So, from 1850 and continuing year on year, ships started to come. Each deposited a varied assortment of plants from botanical gardens in Europe, South Africa and Argentina and by the late 1870s, eucalyptus, norfolk island pine, bamboo, and banana were in profusion at the highest point of the island, Green Mountain.

Heh. Right now I'm only interested in what you said.
You said that

&gt; most Jews in Israel are of European descent, including the ones that stopped over in USA. 

You then, in your second to last comment, provided a link that proved the opposite. I just made sure you knew it. 

Now, in a sorry attempt to defend your bogus claims, you say that

&gt; \[t\]he 3000000 figure covers all Jews of non-Ashkenazi descent, many from non-Arab countries. Arab != Muslim.

Pfff. So you seem to agree that your original assertion (""most Jews in Israel are of European descent."") is false. I guess that settles it, thank you. Besides that, coming from an Arab country isn't a necessary condition for being Mizrahi. See, e.g., Iranian Jews.

You say ""I quoted the article to show that 30% of the Jews living in Israle today are first-generation immigrants, most from Europe. "" Why do you think that I think the article doesn't say that? Didn't you read my other comments? Tip: I won't think you're a douche if you stop acting like one. Anyway,  the problem with the tables that you linked to, as I said before, is that they say nothing about the origins of more than 37% of the Jews in Israel (those whose father was born in Israel) and about those whose father immigrated to Israel. Further, when you look at the original data you see that of those Israeli Jews whose father immigrated to Israel the majority is Mizrahi, while of those who immigrated themselves to Israel
the majority is not Mizrahi, and I explained why this is not surprising given the large Russian immigration in the last 20 years. This is perfectly aligned with the quote I gave [above](http://www.reddit.com/r/Israel/comments/d678z/the_smoking_gun_arab_immigration_into_palestine/c0xwndx). Also, with regards to them 37% Israeli Jews whose father was born in Israel, while the Wikipedia tables provide zero information with regards to them, I nevertheless showed you that currently about 50% of Israeli Jews are Mizrahi.

In the UK NHS doctors were well paid until they renegotiated their wages (a few years ago), at which time they became very well paid compared to the rest of the population. 

According to press figures from a few years ago(2007) general practitioners were earning an average of £118,000 pa and  consultants £110,000 pa.

On another forum it was suggested British doctors were the best paid in Europe, I can't confirm this but wouldn't be surprised.

Also: Learn the languages! After 2 years my boyfriend still did not manage to find a job but because he made a effort to learn the language they eventually permitted him to stay when there was a hearing.

My comment was on how we need to act; that doing nothing, solves nothing - in that way similar to a broken arm or toothache. Yes the comparison is simple! It's not a fucking college thesis. It's not a goddamn mathematical proof. It's not a cross-cultural multi-layered parable, thinly-veiled satire nor is it a peer-reviewed article. I'll spell it out for you. The opinion expressed is:


Regarding the economy, it is better to do something than to do nothing.


Got it? No deeper meaning is implied. Except for action versus inaction, there is nothing to debate here. The original commenter advocated doing nothing and that's plain stupid. If you don't understand, go ask a grown up or someone with an adult reading level or at least someone who isn't so ignorant of current events as to ask, ""Is the economy broken?"" 

Here's a bit of advice that includes an analogy of you wondering if the economy is broken. Ready? Here we go:

Standing in a tempest and wondering if it's raining does not make you an intellectual, nor does ""using"" ""excessive"" quotations. It's pouring rain. Everything is soaked, ruined, there's flooding and hunger and people moving to higher ground. The economy is shit. People have no jobs, no savings, debt, no universal health care. Wages have been flat for decades. Trickle-down economics is raining piss on everyone but the wealthy and the umbrella of steady jobs/good economy is supposed to protect people from the rain has failed to open. (How you are unaware of all of this is your own damn problem.) Now, you ask

1) Can we ""fix"" an umbrella?

Yes. See FDR's ""New Deal"" and familiarize yourself with Keynesian economic theory as well as the current conditions in Germany. (That's a country in Europe. They were the runner's up in WW2.) 

2) Is the umbrella ""broken"", or was it ""broken"" before and undergoing a natural adjustment?

""Is the umbrella broken?"" has already been answered. 

""Was it broken before?"" is kind of irrelevant. It has been needing repair for years. It is obviously malfunctioning now. We are very close to a catastrophic failure. 

""Is the umbrella undergoing a natural adjustment?"" A race to the bottom is not a natural adjustment. The game is rigged. We know the banks and Wall Street firms were double dealing and hedging their bets on a collapse that they themselves caused. We're dealing with the end result of decades of class theft: it's taken the rich about 40 years to absorb all of the wealth earned by the nigh-extinct middle class between 1945 - 1970. A $35 an hour automobile worker in America having to compete with an automobile worker in Mexico earning $26 a day is not natural. College graduates earning $9 an hour is not natural. There's nothing natural about any of this. 

3) If the umbrella was ""broken"", do we know how to ""fix"" it without causing undesired and unseen negative effects? 

Yes there are plenty of viable options, but what can get passed in DC with the GOP acting as the party of no and Obama failing to provide effective leadership and both parties suckling at the corporate teats? A century of propaganda has the most ignorant and vile 20% of Americans up in arms over phantom menaces, like death panels, birth certificates and deficits.

Interest rates are nearly zero. If the government won't borrow money when we need it and interest rates are nearly zero, then when should the government borrow money? Credit is a tool; using credit during an emergency (and an economic depression is an emergency) is exactly what credit is good for. We're absolutely lucky that interest rates are almost zero at the exact moment that we need to borrow money.

Bottom line: there's plenty of work that needs to be done and plenty of unemployed people. It's an ideal situation as the solution readily presents itself.

If you want to ask me my opinion of such things, that's one thing, but don't keep focusing on the ridiculous non-issue of a quick-n-dirty throwaway analogy.

Comparing Denmark's social programs to that of the US is akin to grabbing, at random, any quasi-affluent county in the US and comparing it's community services against the median of the state's.

Is Denmark supporting Greece? Formulating an efficient Federal healthcare system for the US will be far more difficult that it has been for Denmark. A more fair comparison would be setting up a Universal European Healthcare Program that must include Turkey. Sell that to the Danes.

As Obama likes to say in so many words, this shit is difficult. For America to adopt similar programs, and it should, Maryland will have to pay for Arkansas, California will have to pay for South Carolina, Texas will have to pay for Arizona, and so on.

A large percentage of users on this site are under 25. When I was 25 i had similar views. Companies are bad, tax the hell out of the rich, give me what Europe has, etc.

In a few years many of these same users will get a job, actually pay taxes, actually travel to Europe, buy homes, etc. They will gradually move more towards the center after a little experience. When I was 25 I don't think one of my friends was conservative.

From their experiences they'll realize things like:

Europe-Great place to vacation and possibly live but not as rosy as everyone makes it out to be. Very expensive to live, tiny overpriced housing, big brother, no initiative to excel, lack of jobs because employers have fled, etc. 

Taxes-Once you actually start paying more in taxes than you actually consume it will start to piss you off. You'll look at your property taxes and think ""Why the hell am I paying $1,000/year for a hospital that I've never seen?"", ""Why the hell am I paying $2,500/year for a sub standard school that is filled with unionized teachers that have no accountability"", etc.

Homes-Why should my tax money go to bail out home owners and banks who took risks? Why does the government work so hard in getting people into homes they can't afford. Where is my break for being conservative with my money.

Not saying I agree with the Republicans because they make some of the same mistakes but i have become more and more conservative (and pissed) the older I get.",,1426447744,0,-2,-2

I love how you keep harping on how I vaguely phrased 600 AD two or three posts ago after I rephrased it, as if its the magic strawman that makes your argument relevant.  But seriously, I wish you were that specific about the actual tribe practicing pedophilia (the Pashtun tribe) instead of using blanket statements like ""acceptable practice in *Muslim culture.*""

&gt;By the way, you would do well to leave the name calling in a forum where facts are not presented in a discussion. It only negates your position.

You're so right, how dare I respond rudely when someone says I'm supporting pedophilia, Charles Manson and Jeffery Dahlmer.  And fuck me for using sarcasm when someone is going off on an emotional tirade against the Muslim world.  Where are my manners.

&gt;This is exactly the same. I see no outcry among the rest of the Muslim world. I see no missions launched by Muslims around the world to stomp out this practice where it is prevalent. I see no effort to hold up Muhammad's actions as something to be ashamed of.

I'll give credit where credit is due.  [I_TYPE_IN_ALL_CAPS](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/d7wsa/afghan_men_glorify_pedophilia_and_practice_it/c0y824c) did a damn good job finding the original article, and pointing out that yes, plenty of groups in Afghanistan are doing something to combat the problem, including, gasp, Muslim Clerics.  

&gt;I did not lump anybody with anybody.

Your so right...

&gt;If they're doing something wrong, following a pedophile, killing innocent people with bombs, you bet your ass I'm going to point it out and hold it up for scrutiny.

Oh, wait nevermind.  I'll give you props for trying your best to remedy it.  Lets try to focus on the specific groups and communities.  

&gt;Second: In your logic, the pedophilia is perfectly acceptable because Muslims are being harassed in certain areas of the world.  What?  You are apologetic for tradition and Holy Doctrine that is unacceptable. If I start a cult that performs human/child sacrifice, and then one of the members gets beat up, is the human/child sacrifice then acceptable?
&gt;There is no pass for religious or cultural stupidity. If a person holds up their religion as a reason or an excuse for their bad behavior, they should be well aware that their religion will become sullied by their actions.

You seem to be under the impression that by pointing out right or wrong, that it was common practice SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS AGO (yes, I know, have fun), that I am taking the point of extreme cultural relativism and giving modern pedophilia my big rubber stamp of approval.  That's a bit of an unfair, over reaching to say I condone the modern practice because I put the prophets actions in the proper context, especially considering when I explicitly said it was wrong in an earlier post.  

And no, at no point did I say the practice of Bacha bazi was ok b/c muslims were persecuted.  I pretty much said its distasteful and mean spirited to keep label the prophet as a pedophile out of context and insult a people who are being persecuted in such a poisoned national climate. 

To explain this in an extremely ham fisted analogy.  Say instead of you saying the prophet was a pedophile in our modern American and European political climate, lets say I said ""Jews killed Jesus"" in 1930's Germany.  (An extreme analogy, but stay with me).  Now I'm ignoring the context that it was a small group of religious leaders that played a minor role in his execution, but I use your argument that ""I'm just stating a fact,"" and ""I'm just anti-religion in general, I'm expressing my atheist beliefs.""  Likewise, I could deflect any criticism that I'm making an inflammatory statement in a specific hateful environment by saying, ""well there are millions of Jews, and they're treated well in America and England.""  But at the end of the day, my statement was a low, disgusting, hateful move on my part.  Which is how I see your statement.

&gt;There is no pass for religious or cultural stupidity. If a person holds up their religion as a reason or an excuse for their bad behavior, they should be well aware that their religion will become sullied by their actions.

Actually, I couldn't agree with you more.  Except I'd go as far as to add: There is no pass for **BELIEF** or cultural stupidity. If a person holds up their religion **OR LACK OF RELIGION** as a reason or an excuse for their bad behavior, they should be well aware that their **belief system** will become sullied by their actions.  And that's why I'm arguing with you.

Denmark, or actually this area of Europe's grid, is just more robust than in the US. This is because of underinvestment in infrastructure in the US as I'm sure you're well aware. 

&gt; No, it is a cop out.

No, it's not. And I don't ignore France, read my post again. I explicitly say that it's proven you can grow nuclear to the be the mainstay of your electricity generation. I actually base this assumption on France.

However, I personally do not support France's policies. I would not want my country to be saturated with the type of nuclear plants they have at all. There is a high chance that the fact that their plants are falling apart at the moment will leave them with disaster that will have a much longer lasting impact than Deepwater Horizon. 

&gt; Nuclear power is much safer and better for the environment than fossil fuels, and it can do the full grid, unlike renewables.

Only at a huge cost. Nuclear isn't very flexible in starting up / shutting down. The reason it works in France is because when they overproduce they can sell off their excess energy to other countries. So while the share or nuclear is high in France, the share of nuclear power generated in France in markets where it's used is much lower. Even so they still have to deal with costly shutdowns in weekends for example. 

France has been willing to take on these things from a policy perspective, which includes the government absorbing a great deal of the cost (including hidden cost) and assumption of all the financial risk by the state and state companies. What they get back is energy independence (except when it's hot, see below* :P), and effectively subsidized low power prices. As a bonus they created an export industry for nuclear tech.

This is not much different from Denmark's wind power policies, both in advantages and disadvantages. Of course done on a smaller scale for less money.

\* They also have a huge problem with water supply, when temperatures climb and the water becomes to warm, France suddenly become a mass importer of electricity. This can not be solved by evaporating waste water I'm afraid, which seems to be a very specific solution for that location.

In a country with the safety record of the US (as illustrated by you) or China, I'd be *really* terrified if they had the infrastructure that France has today. One can only hope China is evolved enough as a country by the time their plants start becoming old. As for the US, they can't even manage a well.

As for solar, I think if you want to invest in a ""manhattan"" project, I'd argue investing in a tech where you know you can make gains and have almost guaranteed returns. Solar at least has this outlook. Thorium might be worth looking at. I don't think the goal would be to look at already established industry where there is little hope for big gains.

What you argue for seems to be something similar to France or Denmark, where the government commits to taking responsibility for generating power using a certain mode (for whatever reason, CO2, energy security, etc), and pays the money needed to make that switch. Then either you raise electricity prices to pay for it, or you raise taxes (or you take on more debt).

Honestly I don't think the US is capable of that. ""Private enterprise"" will demand to be involved, you'll end up with hand outs to industry and more debt.",,1426447798,0,1,1

let's also make a distinction between the palestinian government and hamas, and i think this is very important to understand. A sovereign government (Israel) is striking back at the acts of a militant organization that isn't affiliated with Palestinian authority by blockading Gaza and all the palestinian people living there, and also by kicking palestinians off of land they have been living on for years. this is disproportionate. it is reckless.
in the summer of 2006, 2 israeli soldiers were kidnapped at the lebanese border by hezbollah militants. this prompted a large-scale invasion of lebanon and airstrikes that destroyed infrastructure and killed thousands of civilians.

Actually, no. Murder is not federally illegal. Neither is theft. Nor rape. So why would abortion be? In fact, Ron Paul has said repeatedly that violent crimes were never meant to be a federal issue. The Constitution was drawn up to ally the several sovereign states against European powers, not to create a new jurisdiction for prosecuting crimes. Murder, rape, theft, and abortion were illegal at state levels before the Constitution was ratified and continued to be illegal afterward. Federal intervention was never intended nor authorized.

Are you lumping all evangelicals together and all protestants? What about Shia and Sunni? You're going to have to cut this pie awfully slim no matter what, so I'm just curious how tiny each slice is.

&gt; The believer will be in context of the Christian faith.

That's writing off a lot of possible options, even hypothetically. For the argument, I'd assume ""supreme deity"" versus ""no supreme deity"" and once you've proven THAT point you can move on to the nature of that deity. But it's your argument.

&gt; There is no God. The universe was created by sheer and magnificent luck; a beautiful collaboration of timing and circumstance. Human beings are evolved life forms, which fought their way through the cellular food chain, slowly immerging into the ice cream loving individuals that we know today.

What does this have to do with God? Are you suggesting that a believer is automatically a young-earth creationist? Are we debating the mechanics of evolution and gastronomical taste? 

&gt; In this scenario, the Atheist has been right along. Unlike mere sheep, 

Uh... wait.

&gt; they've developed their own theories of ""why we are here"", and are not about to be pushed into some child like fantasy where a father figure rules the clouds in a floating city.

For a hypothetical argument with initial disclaimers of ""not all atheists are prideful"" you sure like to paint with angry colors.

&gt; Not only are they on the up and up, 

more ranting. snipped.

&gt; all the while looking forward to a long and eventless dirt nap when their time is up.

Right.

&gt; Turns out, the self proclaimed Atheist not only missed the memo, but actually laughed at its warning, ran it through the shredder, taped it back together, and laughed at it again.

Moving across the palette from angry colors to sarcastic, imaginary colors.

&gt; In this scenario, the Atheist learns that not only is there a God, but there's an afterlife! One where your relationship with the creator is stretched beyond the limits of time; good things take place here my friends, far above the humanistic bar of numerous red headed virgins and clouds that taste like beloved ice cream. So for those who used their time to establish a living relationship with the creator of the universe, things are looking pretty fancy dancy for say, the next forever or so. Though, that’s not the case for everyone...crap crapity crap.

Yeah, darn those atheists for not buying into Allah and his prophet. No virgins for them.

&gt; For others it seems, existence after their meat seat shuts down, is going to be a less then a kick ass vacation of eternity. Turns out “the soul” was real as well, and this little invention of spiritual and physical fusion wasn't designed to ""die"", ever

Yay, eternal torment! That'll learn them!

&gt; So for those of who decided that God wasn't worth the time, a new found and endless after life will exist in a place where God (the very embodiment of love, happiness, light, warmth, fun times, and euphoria) simply does not roll. A place where I’m sure, the taste of foot will not be lost.

Such benevolence! Instead of sitting in the Bosom of Abraham in the great promised land, unbelievers and the nonchosen are cast into Sheol and the Void.

&gt; Turns out the answer was there all along, and it was God. Life wasn’t about money, sex, a partner, or even family.

And the ""told you so"" just continues unabated.

&gt; No, life was simply a test, a chance even, to see if we would spend our fleeting moments, giving God the glory and respect he/she/it deserves, for giving us the gift of life.

A test based on where you were born and who your parents were. Born before the 18th century anywhere but Western Europe? No salvation for you. Live in China or Japan at any point in human history? Eternal torment.

&gt; In this scenario, [snip]

&gt; The Believer is Incorrect.
&gt; In this scenario, life’s only meaning is the wellbeing of yourself and the people who matter most to you. 

And the destruction of the infidels and unbelievers. Especially if you were worshiping the wrong God.

&gt; If it doesn’t hurt anyone else,

Yeah, I think a debate could be raised here.

&gt; the model for joy is to do what makes you happy. 

I thought it was about picking the right god and saying to heck with this temporary little existence? Why worry if you cast it all off and exist forever?

&gt; The senseless wars in the name of believers, was simply that, senseless; a true testimony to how jaded truly the human being could become. 

Riiiiiight.

&gt; No one really knows why we are here, but one thing remains were true, we’re here for a good time, not a long time.

The Democrats, on the other hand, more closely resemble the coalition governments you see in many European nations. The only thing holding them together is the electoral college and the fact that it makes third-party efforts entirely futile. Democrats are much more fractured and their in-fighting tends to be much more overt - I'm sure the GOP has its share of dissent as well, but it seems to take place behind closed doors, whereas the Democrats air their dirty laundry *as they're voting.* So the Democratic ""majority"" is a fairly illusory one - yes, it's a single party; no, it's not a single agenda.",,1426447964,0,7,7

Except that it does. You would really believe that all the laws banning  palestinian refugees from their homes they were only kicked out of less than 100 years ago, is not about zionism?

My point is this Zionism is very clear about its goals. they want a JEWISH NATION in the HOLY LAND. They elected the leaders to carry that out, and the settlers are being funded appropriately to carry out that agenda. You can insist all you want that its not so, but that is what they are doing. You cant argue against historical facts, and they are pretty simple, Israel is taking Palestinian land to fulfill a biblical fantasy.

If you look on the streets of Europe, it's absolutely necessary because almost *every* street can't fit vehicles let alone park vehicles, so a more mobile form of transportation is **required**. Having bike paths for the sake of having bike paths is douchebaggery and it's pissing off more people than it's satisfying.

That's right, let's tear up our streets and form bicycle paths to accommodate the *avant garde* vision of hipster bicyclists. And you are linking me pictures of streets that are only for bikes on huge intersections with a very small density of bicyclists, not helping your case either. Actually, it's not helping your case at all because:

a) The paths aren't REQUIRED.  
b) They have a negative impact on traffic (lets remove lanes and add traffic to the existing cluttered lanes to accommodate the extremely small ratio of bikers to drivers).  
c) No motor vehicles are allowed on these pathways.  

It has no positive impact on anything. Get your head out of your ass. I don't usually reply in such an arrogant manner but this bicycle issue drives me straight up the fucking wall. I would like to get places in my vehicle instead of fucking about with bicycle paths reserving a possible extra car lane.

To transform the tight streets of Toronto into that of Europe, you need to tear the entire street up from sidewalk to sidewalk (including the sidewalk). Then, repeat this process for every street. Not only do we lack the funds to do so, but Europe is built this way to accommodate it's massive amount of people. It wasn't an architectural decision, it was an accommodative decision. 

Blocking traffic for people who pay for parking, who commute over 50 km a day in a car to get to their office job all for bikers is fucked up. I don't want to do a 35km bike ride to my destination in a suit, no thank you.

7. UNIVERSAL WAR

#
We must be in a position to respond to every act of opposition by war with the neighbors of that country which dares to oppose us: but if these neighbors should also venture to stand collectively together against us, then we must offer resistance by a universal war.

#
The principal factor of success in the political is the secrecy of its undertakings: the word should not agree with the deeds of the diplomat.

#
We must compel the governments of the GOYIM to take action in the direction favored by our widely conceived plan, already approaching the desired consummation, by what we shall represent as public opinion, secretly promoted by us through the means of that so-called ""Great Power"" - THE PRESS, WHICH, WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS THAT MAY BE DISREGARDED, IS ALREADY ENTIRELY IN OUR HANDS.

In a word, to sum up our system of keeping the governments of the goyim in Europe in check, we shall show our strength to one of them by terrorist attempts and to all, if we allow the possibility of a general rising against us, we shall respond with the guns of America or China or Japan.

However, like another post says, all domestic dogs are the same species but some breeds cannot reproduce with others, though this is down to simple logistics of mating, rather than genetics, so artificial insemination should work.

However, there are some murky areas in this definition.  For example one ""species"" of swallow (i think it is the swallow anyway, but the point is still the same) lives naturally all over the world, so therefore we would expect any of these swallows to be able to reproduce with any other in the world.   This is not the case, as the swallows that are most geographically distant and therefore more genetically different are incapable of producing offspring, but all are able to reproduce with other swallows within a large geographical area.  This means that an American swallow may be able to have children with a European swallow but not with an Asian, but a European swallow will, etc.

This interesting fact occurs not only geographically but historically as well.  We now have discovered many different ancient species by means of fossils, but if we were to see all the fossils of all of a particular evolutionary line it would be impossible to separate species as all animals along the chain would be able to breed with those just before and after it, and any notion of species would be entirely arbitrary.

&gt;However, I personally do not support France's policies. I would not want my country to be saturated with the type of nuclear plants they have at all. There is a high chance that the fact that their plants are falling apart at the moment will leave them with disaster that will have a much longer lasting impact than Deepwater Horizon.

Whatever. There is no reason to believe this. French reactors have the same safety features as US reactors.

&gt;Nuclear isn't very flexible in starting up / shutting down. 

And neither are renewables. They are even worse because people have no control over them.

&gt;The reason it works in France is because when they overproduce they can sell off their excess energy to other countries. 

And that is a bad thing? They are helping Germany since renewables are such a failure there.

Also, excess energy can be used in synthetic fuel production, water desalination, and many other industrial processes. Excess energy is unambiguously a good thing.


&gt;France has been willing to take on these things from a policy perspective, which includes the government absorbing a great deal of the cost (including hidden cost) and assumption of all the financial risk by the state and state companies. 

So what? I'm not against government involvement in the economy when private industry cannot deal with certain important thing (e.g. long term research funding, large infrastructure investment like energy and transportation, etc.). The only thing private industry is willing to pay for is fossil fuels, because they are far cheaper than nuclear or renewables (unless one takes into account externalities).

And our energy companies (and all other major corporations) are implicitly backed by the government as well, as fall 2008 proved.

&gt;This is not much different from Denmark's wind power policies, both in advantages and disadvantages. Of course done on a smaller scale for less money.

Which is why Denmark still uses so much coal.

&gt;They also have a huge problem with water supply, when temperatures climb and the water becomes to warm, France suddenly become a mass importer of electricity. This can not be solved by evaporating waste water I'm afraid, which seems to be a very specific solution for that location.

That is not inherent with nuclear power, but is an aspect of thermal power plants, so it applies equally to coal fired plants, natural gas plants, and solar thermal. The French went cheap with their cooling tower designs. There are technologies that can deal with this, as Joe Romm has pointed out for solar thermal (which applies equally well to nuclear).

http://climateprogress.org/2009/04/29/csp-concentrating-solar-power-heller-water-use/

&gt;In a country with the safety record of the US (as illustrated by you) or China, I'd be really terrified if they had the infrastructure that France has today.

Be fair for a second. The fossil industry in the US is private and largely unregulated thanks to industry lobbying. The nuclear industry is heavily regulated and very safe. No one has ever died from commercial nuclear energy in the US.

&gt;As for solar, I think if you want to invest in a ""manhattan"" project, I'd argue investing in a tech where you know you can make gains and have almost guaranteed returns. 

You keep talking about guaranteed returns, but **we don't know that for a fact**. The growth curve could easily end at any time because real growth curves are S-shaped.

&gt;I don't think the goal would be to look at already established industry where there is little hope for big gains.

I'm advocating major changes for the nuclear industry. I do not want them to continue as they have been with large and expensive reactors. I want small, factory-built, mass-produced reactors like mPower and eventually LFTR.

&gt;What you argue for seems to be something similar to France or Denmark, where the government commits to taking responsibility for generating power using a certain mode (for whatever reason, CO2, energy security, etc), and pays the money needed to make that switch. Then either you raise electricity prices to pay for it, or you raise taxes (or you take on more debt).

I believe the private market can do the small nukes just fine. That is the whole point of going small. We will see what happens though in a few years because the mPower, NuScale, and Hyperino are all currently preparing for licensing.

&gt;Honestly I don't think the US is capable of that.

We are capable of it from a technological perspective. This is the country that went to the moon, invented nuclear weapons and nuclear power, invented airplanes, invented the Internet, etc. We just need to stop letting Reaganism on the right and anti-development environmentalism on the left destroy our ability to do great things.

I'm not sure what it is that makes it like this but I have a few theories.  I think conservative practices are driven more by ideology rather than real-world impact.  Take a look at financial regulations, taxes, and healthcare.  Sure, what they're saying sounds like it would work but they don't take into account that private business isn't the White Knight they make it out to be.

As we returned to our car in the rear of the dimly-lit parking lot, a well-dressed, heavyset dude approached us.  With a heavy European accent, he said, ""Hello.  I'm out here on business from Italy, and I work for the fashion industry.  My company provides suits for sale.  I'm leaving for Italy tonight, and I can't bring them back to Europe without paying customs.  Would you like to buy some suits at a discount price?""  

He proceeds to show us his car full of suits.  I remember they were brand name.  At this point, I was sufficiently creeped out to whisper to my roommate, ""Let's get out of here.""

My roommate would have none of it.  We drive the Italian to the bank and proceed to withdraw hundreds of dollars.  We return to his car and make the exchange.

&gt;""Yeah, darn those atheists for not buying into Allah and his prophet. &gt;No virgins for them.""

Honestly, what.the.fuck? 
If the atheist is wrong, and God is real, it's not going to be anywhere close to a calm realization for them. 

&gt;""Such benevolence! Instead of sitting in the Bosom of Abraham in the &gt;great promised land, unbelievers and the nonchosen are cast into &gt;Sheol and the Void.""

Here you use sarcasm. I am happy that you understand the mechanics. And yes, an eternity without God will suck, a, da balls.

My girlfriend (American) gets 10 days making it hard for her to get enough time off to come and visit me in the UK. I on the other hand get 28 days (including public holidays) and am pretty sure I could not survive on less.
Add to this the fact that if I'm sick I take a sick day (doesn't count as a personal day) and she has to use a vacation day. So in total I get probably an extra 7-8 days paid per year from that too. 

I spoke to one of my other American friends about it and she seemed convinced Americans don't want more holiday (???) and they want to work hard for their money. I assume she just says this to make herself feel better about her terrible vacation allowance?

Personally if I started a business in the US I would offer 20+ days holiday to all staff in the hope that I would therefore attract better workers to my company, who were well rested all year round and not stressed out zombies, but that's just me.    
    
Any Americans care to share their feelings on this?

Edit: Quality of life vs. Higher wages. Qualified Americans will generally receive more money than Europeans in a given job - however for me quality of life isn't just about money - I want to travel, take time to relax, visit friends, take days off for festivals etc. throughout the year. I feel that a slightly lower wage is a small price to pay for this. I'm not saying your way is ""wrong"" so much as it is not my preference. The US does not have the highest quality of life of any country in the world - it seems to be a pretty big myth.

I feel like there are lots of Americans who don't realise that lots of Europe is as good of a place to live as their country. You don't really win in any measure apart from average pay in my eyes. Having lived in Germany, the UK and visited America on multiple occasions, I would say that I would much rather live in Germany if I wanted a happy life. Excuse my generalisations here (obviously the US varies a lot state to state). I can't speak for everyone but I don't mind higher taxes and more expensive services/goods in exchange for not being worked to the bone and ending up on prozac. Hopefully I haven't come across as too much of a jerk - I actually love the US and really enjoy visiting it. I just feel like you guys get screwed over a lot and it makes me rage when I hear my girlfriend say she isn't going to call in sick when really ill as she won't have enough time to come visit me otherwise.

&gt;Again, the document says ""it is indispensable for our purpose that wars, so far as possible, should not result in territorial gains"". This very phrase, of 1905 or earlier, was made the chief slogan, or apparent moral principle, proclaimed by the political leaders of America and Britain in both world wars, and in this case the difference between ""the word"" and ""the deed"" of ""the diplomat"" has been shown by results. The chief result of the First War was to establish revolutionary-Zionism and revolutionary-Communism as new forces in international affairs, the first with a promised ""homeland"" and the second with a resident State. The chief result of the Second War was that further ""territorial gains"" accrued to, and only to, Zionism and Communism; Zionism received its resident State and Communism received half of Europe. The ""deadly accuracy"" (Lord Sydenham's words) of the Protocol's forecasts seems apparent in this case, where a specious phrase used in the Protocols of 1905 became the daily language of American presidents and British prime ministers in 1914-1918 and 1939-1945.

&gt;The reason why the authors of the Protocols held this slogan to be so important, in beguiling the peoples, is also explained. If the nations embroiled in wars are denied ""territorial gains"", the only victors will then be ""our international agentur. . . our international rights will then wipe out national rights, in the proper sense of right, and will rule the nations precisely as the civil law of States rules the relations of their subjects among themselves"". To bring about this state of affairs compliant politicians are needed, and of them the Protocols say: ""The administrators whom we shall choose from among the public, with strict regard to their capacities for servile obedience, will not be persons trained in the arts of government, and will therefore easily become pawns in our game in the hands of men of learning and genius who will be their advisers, specialists bred and reared from early childhood to rule the affairs of the whole world"".

&gt;The reader may judge for himself whether this description fits some of ""the administrators"" of the West in the last five decades; the test is their attitude towards Zionism, the world-revolution and world-government, and subsequent chapters will offer information in these three respects. But ""deadly accuracy"" appears to reside even more in the allusion to ""advisers"".

&gt;Here again is ""uncanny knowledge"", displayed more than fifty years ago. In 1905 the non-elected but powerful ""adviser"" was publicly unknown. True, the enlightened few, men like Disraeli, knew that ""the world is governed by very different persons from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes"", but to the general public the passage would have been meaningless.

&gt;In the First and Second World Wars, however, the non-elected, unofficial but imperious ""adviser"" became a familiar public figure. He emerged into the open (under ""emergency powers"") and became known to and was passively accepted by the public masses; possibly the contempt which the Protocols display for ""the mob"" was justified by this submission to behind-the-scenes rule even when it was openly exercized. In the United States, for instance, ""advisers on Jewish affairs"" became resident at the White House and at the headquarters of American armies of occupation. One financier (who public1y recommended drastic measures for ""ruling the affairs of the world"") was adviser to so many presidents that he was permanently dubbed ""Elder Statesman"" by the press, and visiting prime ministers from England also repaired to him as if to a supreme seat of authority.

&gt;The Protocols foretold this regime of the ""advisers"" when none understood what was meant and few would have credited that they would openly appear in the high places.

&gt;The Protocols repeatedly affirm that the first objective is the destruction of the existing ruling class (""the aristocracy"", the term employed, was still applicable in 1905) and the seizure of property through the incitement of the insensate, brutish ""mob"".

&gt;[...]

&gt;That the Protocols reveal the common source of inspiration of Zionism and Communism is shown by significant parallels that can be drawn between the two chief methods laid down in them and the chief methods pursued by Dr. Herzl and Karl Marx:

&gt;The Protocols repeatedly lay emphasis on the incitement of ""the mob"" against the ruling class as the most effective means of destroying States and nations and achieving world dominion. Dr. Herzl, as was shown in the preceding chapter, used precisely this method to gain the ear of European rulers.

&gt;Next, Karl Marx. The Protocols say, ""The aristocracy of the peoples, as a political force, is dead. . . but as landed proprietors they can still be harmful to us from the fact that they are self-sufficing in the resources upon which they live. It is essential therefore for us at whatever cost to deprive them of their land. . . At the same time we must intensively patronize trade and industry . . . what we want is that industry should drain off from the land both labour and capital and by means of speculation transfer into our hands all the money of the world.. ...""

&gt;Karl Marx in his Communist Manifesto exactly followed this formula. True he declared that Communism might be summed up in one sentence, ""abolition of private property"", but subsequently he qualified this dictum by restricting actual confiscation to land and implying that other types of private property were to remain intact. (In the later Marxist event, of course, all private property was confiscated, but I speak here of the strict parallel between the strategy laid down before the event alike by the Protocols and Marx).

&gt;A passage of particular interest in the present, though it was written before 1905, says, ""Nowadays if any States raise a protest against us, it is only proforma at our discretion and by our direction, for their anti-semitism is indispensable to us for the management of our lesser brethren"". A distinctive feature of our era is the way the charge of ""anti-semitism"" is continually transferred from one country to another, the country so accused becoming automatically the specified enemy in the next war. This passage might cause the prudent to turn a skeptical eye on today's periodical reports of sudden ""anti-semitic"" turns in communized Russia, or elsewhere. (the ADL has become particularly adept at this tactic)

&gt;The resemblance to Weishaupt's documents is very strong in the passages which relate to the infiltration of public departments, professions and parties, for instance: ""It is from us that the all-engulfing terror proceeds. We have in our service persons of all opinions, of all doctrines, restorating monarchists, demagogues, socialists, communists, and utopian dreamers of every kind. We have harnessed them all to the task: each one of them on his own account is boring away at the last remnants of authority, is striving to overthrow all established form of order. By these acts all States are in torture; they exhort to tranquillity, are ready to sacrifice everything for peace; but we will not give them peace until they openly acknowledge our international Super-Government, and with submissiveness"".

&gt;The allusions to the permeation of universities in particular, and of education in general, also spring directly from Weishaupt, or from whatever earlier source he received them: "". . . We shall emasculate the universities . . . Their officials and professors will be prepared for their business by detailed secret programmes of action from which they will not with immunity diverge, not by one iotaFinkelstein, W. Churchill). They will be appointed with especial precaution, and will be so placed as to be wholly dependent upon the Government"". This secret permeation of universities (which was successful in the German ones in Weishaupt's day, as his documents show) was very largely effective in our generation. The two British government officials who after their flight to Moscow were paraded before the international press in 1956 to state that they had been captured by Communism at their universities, were typical products of this method, described by the Protocols early in this century and by Weishaupt in 1787.

&gt;Weishaupt's documents speak of Freemasonry as the best ""cover"" to be used by the agents of the conspiracy. The Protocols allot the function of ""cover"" to ""Liberalism"": ""When we introduced into the State organism the poison of Liberalism its whole political complexion underwent a change. States have been seized with a mortal illness, blood-poisoning. All that remains is to await the end of their death agony"".

&gt;The term ""utopian dreamers"", used more than once, is applied to Liberals, and its original source probably resides in the Old Testamentary allusion to ""dreamers of dreams"" with ""false prophets"", are to be put to death. The end of Liberalism, therefore, would be apparent to the student even if the Protocols did not specify it: ""We shall root out liberalism from the important strategic posts of our government on which depends the training of subordinates for our State structure"".

&gt;The ""Big Brother"" regimes of our century, are accurately foretold in the passage, ""Our government will have the appearance of a patriarchal paternal guardianship on the part of our ruler"".

This is pretty much fact nowadays. Vaccines take advantage of this: they contain weakened or dead forms of a disease, but your immune system reacts the same way it would had this been a full blown, real attack. This serves as a training exercise that your immune system learns from, so the next time it encounters this disease it will instantly know what to do, eliminating the intruders so fast you never even show symptoms when invaded the next time.  

In the same way, your immune system learns from natural encounters with bacteria and viruses that happen during everyday life. 

This also explains why many native's were killed by diseases brought over by the Europeans. Things that these foreigners considered minor ailments, such as the common cold, often killed the Native Americans since their immune systems did not know how to deal with these, *puts on sunglasses*, foreign ailments. Genetics also play into this, but much of what is in your genetics comes from generations of immune system experience so it could be theorized that your encounters with bacteria now could give your future generations an advantage in dealing with bacteria and viruses.

*   *   *   

*(this is backstory, you can ignore it if you want)*

In order to understand the modern world, it is necessary to understand how we got here.  And while I recognize that the previous sentence is basically an invitation to long-windedness, I shall attempt to be brief.

Socioeconomically, the most important event to shape the modern world is the [October Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution).  Like the American War of Independence before it, it marked a turning point in social theory: collectivism and socialism would be the new system under experiment.  And, as Communism found its start in violence and repression, those systems that came before it found themselves starkly in opposition.  And so it was that collectivism and individualism found themselves arm-wrestling across the table of history.

If you accept ""collectivism"" to cover communism, socialism and fascism and ""individualism"" to cover liberalism, libertarianism and feudalism, then ""collectivism"" is pretty much the Axis Powers (Germany, Italy, Russia and Japan) and ""individualism"" is pretty much the Allied Powers (America, Britain, France, Australia, Canada, NZ).  Except that halfway through, Germany invades Russia and makes a big dividing line between fascism and socialism.  And, in the ensuing melee, fascism is fundamentally destroyed.

So now the world is divided between the victorious communists of the USSR (and its vassal states, the Warsaw Pact) and the victorious capitalists of the USA (and its vassal states, NATO).  Both countries take their victory and survival as a divine endorsement of their economic systems.  And both proceed to spread them around the world.  The USA, being isolated a continent away from the rest of the world, becomes a geographically isolated but far-flung empire.  The USSR, a train ride from every major economic player in Asia and Europe, becomes an insular, inward-turned empire.  And both philosophies set out to prove, once and for all, that their way is correct.

*   *   *  

*(now you should start reading again)*

In the United States, socialism is virtually nonexistent.  When any hints of it are found, they are [rooted out with zeal.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Scare)  ""Socialists"" become a cartoon parody of Stalin in a bear-skin cap sending people off to labor camps, much like today most Americans hear ""muslim"" and think of dirty turban-wearers in caves with AK-47s.  However, ""Socialists"" in Europe are neighbors.  Not only that, but much of Europe lived for many years under collectivist systems... and since [much of Europe was rebuilt in a giant public works program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan), the notion that you have to bust your ass, all the time, without any safety net, never really takes root.  

You see, Americans were taught that the way you get ahead is by working hard, that hard work is virtuous, that nobody owes you anything, that we're a self-made country, and that there is no ill that cannot be defeated through [more More MORE production.](http://www.propagandaposters.us/poster3.html)  So - if you want to get ahead, work harder.  If you want your kids to get ahead, teach them to work harder.  This way lies victory - thank god you aren't a communist, they spend their lives in labor camps and bread lines.

Soviets, on the other hand, were taught that Americans have no safety net, that they're greedy, and that if they don't bust their ass, they'll die of hunger and disease because no one is taking care of them.  [Americans are greedy, the state will take care of you, and we're all in this together comrade, don't worry too much about the fact that the Politburo has cars and you don't.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3ezma9cLEs#t=1m09s)

*(I'm getting there, I promise)*

Most of the world, of course, figured out that both the USA and USSR were batshit insane.  Rather than get trapped in an idealogical battle over the absolute correctness of capitalism or communism, they picked a little from Column A, a little from Column B, and [played the two sides off each other for fun and profit.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement)  Not enough vacation?  The socialists will give you more vacation.  Look how well it works in the USSR.  Taxes too high?  The capitalists will lower your taxes.  Look how well it works in the USA.  Can't take care of mom?  The socialists will give you socialized medicine.  Look how well it works in the USSR.  Schools too shitty?  The capitalists will give you private colleges.  Look how well it works in the USA.

This tendency tempered most of Europe, giving Europeans the best of capitalism and the best of communism.  England, being adjacent to these semi-socialist economies, had an object lesson in them.  As such, England adapted some of the more blatant socialist perqs, such as the NHS.

The USA, on the other hand, never had to let go of our Communist Cartoon because all that ""socialism"" stuff was happening an ocean away.  So as time went on, the social changes we gained in the Great Depression (back when we had a [Socialist Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wobblies), labor [riots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_Strike) and even [official communes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeland,_Washington)) vanished like it was Morning in America.

And then communism lost.

And so, now vindicated, capitalism steams ahead, vindicated in the notion that through greater production lies world domination.  The less time you take off, the bigger a chunk if the pie you will get, and the notion that you're entitled to anything from the [mindless drabblings of Frenchmen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Contract) was fundamentally disproven when Mr. Gorbachev tore down that wall.

History's not very important to most Aussies - our most remembered historical events are the Eureka Stockade (early unionists rebelling against opressive taxation during the gold rush) and our involvement in various world wars.

Whenever an anime character is supposed to be Caucasian, I rarely tell the difference between them and their Japanese counterparts.

These characters are European:

Just they just look like anime characters. Nothing too obvious. Even though they are designed as European, they don't look much different than other anime characters. 

A better example is looking at an anime like Code Geass, where half the cast is Asian and half is European. Unless they specifically mention who is which, you can't even tell the difference. 


I like this about anime. I suppose most characters are modeled after Asians, but overall I think that they are just anime characters. They are in a class by themselves. They don't have to have a noticeable racial look to them. It's nice that they don't in my opinion. It allows western and eastern audiences to relate to them. ",,1426448288,0,4,4

United States: about 300,000,000 people, GDP per capita of $46,000

Brazil: about 200,000,000 people, GDP per capita of $8,200.

China: about 1,340,000,000 people, GDP per capita of $4,000.

China has a chance of passing the US because of their tremendously large population. They only need to bring their per capita GDP to a quarter of the US's to be the largest economy in the world. 

Brazil would have to do the opposite. They would have to dramatically increase their per capita GDP, to about 50% more than the US. This really doesn't seem that reasonable. The growth of developing countries is based agriculture, raw materials, or manufacturing. 

Agriculture and mining are great, but they don't create the vast wealth manufacturing does. A car company takes a few hundred dollars worth of raw materials and turns it into a car worth thousands. There's far more wealth to be made selling finished goods than raw materials. 

The relevance to this for Brazil is that, even if they were to suddenly develop a strong manufacturing base, they still could not pass the US. If their per capita wealth starts shooting up, to the point where it's anywhere near the US or Europe, the advantage of cheap labor will be lost. The market then finds another source of cheap labor. 

There is no conceivable scenario where Brazil's per-capita GDP could go from 1/4 of the US's to 50% more. It's just not realistic.",,1426448288,0,10,10

This beauty standard was created by years upon years of racism, oppression, hatred and brainwashing. The beauty standard for women is basically pale/light skin, long straight hair, light colored eyes and in some cases light colored hair. Basically an Aryan woman. Throughout the years this standard has trickled down so that it includes not only Aryan women but races which are close enough to this standard (light skin, long straight hair). Asian women and white Hispanics/Latinas fit this mold. I'm aware that Hispanic isn't a race but for the sake of keeping things condensed here...

Not only have these physical traits kept many black women out of the beauty standard, but there are stereotypes zooming around the minds of ignorant white men as well. Not only white men but everyone. But since this topic is addressing white men and black women, I'll talk about them only. Anyway, black women are stereotyped as being loud, boisterous, ""ghetto"", intolerable, uneducated, ignorant, masculine/unfeminine and basically just despicable. I'm sure you can vouch this as truth; it's highly likely you've heard your white male friends speak poorly of black women before. Perhaps you've heard them say things like ""I would never date a black woman"" or ""I'm just ... not attracted to them"" (which I think is either utter bullshit or complete stupidity but whatever).  Meanwhile, in other news, white women are portrayed as being ""feminine"", kind, lovely, intelligent and basically PERFECT. This also includes women who are closer to being/appearing white than a black woman.

All that being said... do you understand now why white men in this country would prefer to date an Asian or light skinned Hispanic/Latina woman over a black woman any day? I'm speaking only of interracial relationships since there are more people dating within their own race than dating outside of their race. A white man would most likely choose a fellow white over any other race, but in the interracial world he's more inclined to choose an Asian or light skinned Hispanic/Latina woman over a black woman, because she's simply too... ugly, primitive and uncultured and such and such for him. 

When it comes to black men and white women, the ""tall, dark and handsome"" standard has also been around for years and supposedly black men are bigger in body size, they are darker than white men, and... handsome? Well that's debatable. 

So who do I blame? I blame society and peoples' BACKWARDS thinking. I blame the media to an extent but there should come a point in someone's life where they realize that the media is not the truth. Just because there are more white women on magazine covers than any other race does not mean they ARE the superior women or they ARE perfect or they ARE the best looking. People need to wake up and smell the coffee, especially Americans. Explore the world! If only people would free their minds from this restrictive backwards mentality MAYBE we would live in a country where race is LESS of an issue when it comes to friendships, romance, marriage and business. I've found in my 20 years on earth that in other countries (not all, but certain countries such as Canada and many European countries) race is not as big of an issue. 

America really needs to catch up with the rest of the world, and in more than just the education department. Morals, belief systems. There needs to be a change, but it won't happen soon. Which is exactly why I'm striving to live elsewhere.

A: Clusters are indistinct from one another if there is not sufficient variance between them. A cluster is not just defined by its internal similarities, but specifically those traits, or combinations of traits, which it does not share with any other group. In a body of informaiton, such as the genome, a very small amount of traits could be shared by one group and not by others, resulting in a fairly superficial clustering. The cluster of  red haired Irishmen as opposed to brunettes, having only this minor variation to distinguish them, does not provide one with sufficient distinction between the two clusters for differentiation to be meaingful, they're all Irishmen. 

B: Never did I say, race = skin color. I said race equals a genetic lineage associated with a particular region. It is a trivial distinction because it is over broad and does not provide one with any meaningful information with which to assess a person's ability, status, and at this point in time, not even their cultural heritage, location of residence, or place of birth.

C: Intelligence and ingenuity are two separate things. White populations are not on the whole determined to be more intelligent than other populations, but due to the competitiveness of their environments, particularly competition between peoples, the much greater amount of cultural and genetic exchange between those groups and with outside groups, conditions which favored longer rearing periods and therefore more education, and the fortuitous accumulation of a body of knowledge, westerners advanced scientifically and technologically ahead of other populations. Conditions in Europe brought about by both environmental and cultural factors made it so that western populations were able to advance more quickly, not that those people were necessarily more intelligent. When conducting studies which control for socio-cultural experience, there is no evidence that white people are smarter than any other group of people. Any apparent discrepancy in intelligence is brought about by sociocultural and economic conditions, not by genetics except in the case of abnormal conditions not known to be more or less prevalent in any population. The fact is that the human species is too young to have much significant variation. 

D:
&gt;Lewontin's argument could be be used to debunk Dog breeds as well (among other sub-classifications of animals).

You clearly don't understand either Lewontin or Edwards. Lewontin's point was that from the fact of a human lineages origin - not dog breeds, as dogs are a different species and have very different variations - one cannot predict that an individual will have any particular trait with much accuracy, Edwards point was that from a sampling of a number of traits one can make an accurate prediction about what general regional lineage the majority of a person's genome comes from. Those two facts are not technically in conflict, that's what Witherspoon demonstrated. This is the case because some traits which are subject to environmental pressures do change and populations reflect that, but the majority of traits do not undergo significant variation where such variation is not called for. This is to say, we're all in the same cluster, exempting a very small percentage of traits which we use to create fairly superficial groupings almost all of which are based on visible traits because our extrinsic form factors are most susceptible to environmental influence as well as social pressures. 

In the case of dogs, human social selection had a dramatic impact beyond environmental conditions as humans bred dogs with specific intentions in mind. In dog species this has resulted in much broader variance into much more distinct clusters, not to mention that dogs were presumably older than humans and already much varied by environment.",,1426448304,0,1,1

My brother is a couple years younger, and a little smaller, also, non-violent.  Our friend, we'll call James is about 5'9"", 140 pounds, and probably has never even been in a fight ever.

It was about 2:30 AM after the bars had closed in Ocean Beach, and my bro and I were getting burritos (not sure where James was, probably by the street socializing).  We were #3 and #4 in line, as we walked up I notice that #2 and #1 in line seemed to be having sort of a face to face moment (not sure if they were seriously mad at this point) and thought they might have actually been buddies.

The guy who is next up to order, #1 in line is huge, about 6'4"", and beefy.  The next guy isn't small, both are probably mid 40s.  Apparently, #1 thought #2 had gotten too close to him in line, and was giving him a hard time for it.  The number 2 guy was holding a skateboard and had sort of squeezed through the door next to beefy #1 to set his skateboard up against a wall.

I approached and the guytaking the orders was patiently waiting for #1 to order, as he and #2 we're sort of squared off face to face so that #1 had his back to the order guy.  Having seen the whole thing and thinking it wasn't that serious I said something like, ""Hey dude, you're up to order"".  He said something back like, ""Who are you, fucking Mr. Impatient?""  I just brushed it off, like ""whatever man, order your food"" and kinda backed away.

Eventually, #1 and #2 seem to cool down and they order, we order, then we all sort of end up standing on the sidewalk waiting for the food.  The place is good, but not super fast, and usually fairly busy around this time, as all the bars just let out.

At this point, me and my bro had reconvened with James, and are shooting the shit, I don't even think James saw what happened at the front of the line.

As it happens, #1 and #2 are about 2 or 3 feet away from us, and #1 still seems quite angry, over what I see as almost nothing.  #2 to me just seems to be trying to calm him down, but it's not going too well.  At one point, he asks where the guy is from, and he says South Dakota.  As it stands now, there were a few other people watching this take place, and one blurted out, ""I bet it's cold there"", and I kind of snicker.  #1 turns at me and says, ""Oh, you think that's funny?  You think South Dakota is a joke?  I should break your teeth out!""

I kinda just laughed again, and moved out of arms reach from the guy.  My brother hears this, and he kind of moves in closer and says, ""Oh hey, South Dakota, that's cool, Billy Mills is from South Dakota, he's one of my heroes.""

The big fella, still angry about whatever, says, ""Oh ya, everyone knows Billy Mills, he was a great Indian or something like that.""

My brother says, ""Ya, he was a Sioux Indian, and an amazing athlete.""

The big guy is like, ""No, he was a Cherokee, all the Indians in South Dakota are Cherokee.""

My brother and him continue to argue about it for a bit, meanwhile, both #1 and #2's orders are ready and Mexican guy is yelling louder and louder for them to come get their food.  The skateboard guy #2 eventually gets both orders, hands #1 his bag, pats him on his shoulder, and they walk/skate off, but not together.

At that point I figured that was the last we'd see of them.

Then, about 10 minutes later, while we're still standing on the sidewalk eating our burritos, I notice #1 has come back.  Now he's sitting on some stairs next to the open air restaurant talking to some younger blond kid, maybe 23-25.  

When I see him I kind of give him a nod, and a little wave, like I hope you're not still pissed about whatever you were pissed about.  Apparently, not the case.  He starts speaking really loudly to the kid about how these guys (meaning me and my brother) were giving him a hard time and how he needs to ""teach us a life lesson"".  He's going on and on about how, ""They think I'm some kind of a joke, I'm 6'4"", 300 pounds, and I don't back down from anyone.""

The blond kid says something to the big guy like, ""I could make a sit com out of you, you are some piece of work""

The kid gets up to leave and says, ""nice meeting you"" or whatever.  At this point, they are about 20 feet away from us.

Then, for as far as I can tell, no reason at all, the big guy jumps up and sprints/lunges at James, going for his throat.  I see him coming for James like he was made of Bacon and do my best to throw a backhand at the guys head, which connects.

Between James being squirmy and me tapping his head, James is able to get away, and I assume start running for it, as I don't remember seeing him for quite awhile from this point.

Now the big dude is sort of looking me up and down and we're squared up, about 5 to 6 feet apart.  My strategy at this point was to just stay fucking far away, as I figured I could outrun him if necessary.

However, at this point my brother gets all ninja like, and sneaks right up behind the guy, and horse collars him down to the ground.  Now, there's no running away, as they go down in a pile, and this guy could probably crush him.

At this point instinct took over, and I launched into an MMA style all out attack on the guy.  I hip checked him as hard as the physics of it would allow and just start raining hay makers down on his head and face.

At some point he kind of shoved me off, and was pushing himself up off the ground.  Then I saw the perfect opportunity and stepped into a NFL kick-off aimed straight into his face, full on, double rainbow.  

Now, several bystanders sort of jump in, and stop the fight.  The guy gets up, I assume fairly dazed, and runs away.

One could, at a pinch, argue that the  Molotov/Ribbentrop Pact was an indication of it, but that would be rather tenuous. 

I can't argue that fascism could be brought under the broad banner of collectivism however (although I did try to...).  It is worth noting though that if you look at them as ideologies, communism and fascism are not similar enough to place together.

It is also worth noting that fascism wasn't totally destroyed at the end of the second world war, it remained, albeit weakened as an element of Franco's Spain.

As to the rest, I would have to agree to a degree.  Politically and socially the Cold War shaped the US, in fact it left a greater mark there than anywhere else bar the Soviet Union.

However, I don't think that the two competing ideologies were seen as places to grab ideas from.  If you take the NHS as an example, it was proposed during the Second World War and became a reality shortly after.  Things like unemployment benefit arrived in the UK even earlier (1910?), the idea of state funded low cost housing came even earlier than that in the 1890's.   

Socialism has never been seen as a net negative in large areas of Europe, mainstream political parties have often identified as such (and been elected...). Even communist parties existed and to a degree thrived in Europe during the cold war, whilst the US was enjoying McCarthyism, Europe was trying to balance the needs of a destitute population.  Ignoring socialist concepts was simply not on the agenda.

So yes, the US has managed to talk itself into a hole, it can't look to solutions or ideas from other places due to potential links with socialism (more to avoid the accusation than anything else), quite something of a legacy for Senator McCarthy..

However, as I noted, there were already moves toward socialism in Europe (As well as fascism) before the war, whilst the US still had something of an individualist revolution, not least because of the level of immigration it saw coupled with the image of personal survival and ambition that it projected.  After the second world war, with the US largely untouched and victorious, it was in a unique position.  One it managed to take advantage of to a remarkable degree, the US became an extraordinarily wealthy state, one where even the poorest were rich, one that sold to the world on its terms.  It was an amazing state of affairs and it bred the concept of US exceptionalism.  

So you end up with a population that feels itself to be exceptional and built entirely on the back of individual effort, that faces an existential threat from a communist state, a government that must fund and maintain enthusiasm for the fight against the communists whilst maintaining at least the illusion of supremacy and wealth at all costs. It is not surprising then that people reject socialism and anything that can be associated with it.

Bring a girl to shop with you (a friend comfortable enough to tease you/laugh at you and preferably likes to paint/is artsy/has a keen eye for colors).

I'm a not handsome-to-homely level guy - never handsome and certainly never popular with the ladies (what are those two steps?).  Additionally, lacking resources was commonplace for me, so my one nice outfit per school year was a stark contrast against my cheap or handmedown outfits (the other four days a week).  One day I bought a suit for a job that required it.  It was a cheap mall suit, think like $200, but I bought *the suit.*  And apparently, as skinny as I am, I can wear *the suit.*  Within a few days I was picked up by a European girl.  After asking me out, she later commented that I was the only guy in the building who wore a suit that fit.  Since, I have made it a point to buy the ""nicest"" suits I can afford.  Not the most expensive.  Get a creative weave and nice color... avoid black and blue.  Shoot for light or dark browns, tans, greens, anything (except purple - though it is my favorite color, there is no place for it in the professional world).  

Probably the most important thing after you find *the suit* is to find *the tie* for it.  Go to every store in your town before you settle on a tie.  Find a tie with a minor color that matches your suit, as well as a minor color that matches your eyes.  And a major color that is not off-putting (though with the right combination, you can pull off a purple tie).  This tie is the tie for the suit you just bought.  It is not for other suits, unless you somehow managed to find an incredible tie that works perfectly for two suits.  Have fun.  Women get to shop for all kinds of crap, we have one accessory - the tie.  Spend at least, if not more time shopping for the tie than anything else.

Get a nice shirt, specifically for that suit.  Get a unique weave and a color that gos well with it.  You can, in fact, get crazy here.  Black dress shirt with a tan - or even better - linen suit... you look like a badass.  Everyone does.  Even us ugmos.  Blue shirt with a brown suit.  Green and cream.  Gray and white.  Light Gray and Black.  Etc, etc...

Get at least three pairs of shoes, to go with your weekly repertoire of suits.  I recommend black, light brown, and dark brown.  They'll go with anything.

Turkey is strictly secular, and on its way to becoming so, we have burned many bridges with the Muslim world. They still don't ""hate"" us, but I wouldn't count on much sympathy for the EU from the Islamic states, for admitting Turkey.

As I stated in another message, yes, we are 98% Muslim, but most of us are [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Muslim) (read under the sub-heading ""Turkey""), and not [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim).

For instance, we have abolished the caliphate (muslim equivalent for papacy). Ottoman emperor held the title of caliph prior to this, and our abolishment of it made the post extinct. There have been other states trying to resurrect it, but it never happened. Even if it did, Turkey would still not recognize the post.

(The Muslim states usually end up fighting with each other when one claims the title of caliph. And by definition there can only be one caliph. Technically it's not really abolished, but its powers are ""transferred and neutralized"". We transfered its powers to our parliament and government. But those powers are limited to Turkey and not the whole Muslim world. Their usage for politics is also a no-no. Strictly regulatory.)

(This is also why we do not recognize the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople (Istanbul) - he is the religious leader of Orthodox christians everywhere, but has no official power in Turkey.)

Compared to other countries, Turkey doesn't come close to their standards of Islam.

Our current administration is (being the ""mild"" islamists they are) trying to re-establish some of those bonds, with varying degrees of success. But our interpretation of Islam stays the same.

This should be made blatantly obvious though: Islam has never had any influence on the law in Turkey, and it still doesn't. That makes calling our attitudes on various matters ""progressive"" kind of wrong, since that implies relativity with respect to Islam. That has never been the case. Not even wedding is governed by religion, islamic weddings are null and void in Turkey, as is any other religious wedding. People are bonded by law, and that is the only way it will be recognized. (Some people refer to this as an atheist/secular marriage)

So, if the EU gets any credit from the Islamic states for admitting us, it'll be because of our other relations with them, not because we're Muslims. We're only superficially regarded as such, if they know their Islam. =)

To solidify things: My mom is a believer, she sometimes prays. That's the only form of worship she commits. She also enjoys gratuitous amounts of bacon. I do not believe (nor does my father), and all three of us (and many others like us - they might not eat bacon as much as me, though. :P) are included within the Muslim demographic of Turkey.

&gt;That might be long and have some historical references, but I think that it's largely incorrect.  Edit: I guess I shouldn't have said incorrect, but misses more important national identities that predate 1917 -and had nothing to do with October although they may have become more pronounced afterward- and treats history as having an oversimplified dialectic (and of course, these isn't a published article, so there's going to be some simplification).

Thanks very much for the edit - I was going to have a hard time arguing with your assessment of my argument as incorrect when you largely seem to agree with it.

Now, nationalism (and the lack thereof).

[Smarter minds than me](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reza_Aslan) have argued better than I can that nationalism is a product of [The Enlightenment.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_enlightenment)  Prior to The Enlightenment, there were no ""countries"" per se - there were tribes.  These tribes might or might not be organized into greater groups, but at a fundamental level, all the world was a petty fiefdom and your identity as a Spaniard took a definite back seat to your identity as a Vasque... but if your church was lucky, your identity as a Vasque took a back seat to your identity as a Christian.

By the time the Enlightenment was over, of course, ""countries"" existed... and were all going to war with each other. Monarchies were overthrown, Constitutions declared, and Napoleon invades Russia.  And if you're no longer the property of The King, but are in fact a citizen, you have to be a citizen of, well, something.

Cue America - which really became a ""nation"" the same time France became a nation, which was a hundred years before Germany became a nation, thirty years before Spain became a nation, and so on and so on.  Europe has lots and lots of architecture that's substantially older than anything in the United States... but as far as sociopolitical identities go, we're contemporaries.  

But, unlike those new countries and their old architecture, Americans had a vast open plain.  And our culture became one of expansionism.  In 1776, ""The United States"" didn't even include *Vermont*, FFS.  By 1803, we owned Idaho.  And so we became a nomadic tribe.

And nomads are materialists.  They have to be.  Their identity is defined by what they own, not where they are.  Which is fine - Mongols were nomads, too, as were the Plains Indians.  But materialist as they might be, nomads don't buy much.  Not without prompting, anyway, which is pretty much what the Robber Barons were all about.

I think it's important to point out that Siberia is crisscrossed with train tracks but the midwest is crisscrossed with interstate freeways.  The difference is Americans own cars and Soviets rode trains.  One is owned by the individual, the other is owned by the state.  And that, right there, is the economic combat of capitalism vs. communism in a nutshell, all the way down to ""national identity.""

ionian--this is your basic major scale.

mixolydian--this is played almost exactly the same as the major scale, but with the seventh note flattened. so if you were playing a c mixolydian scale, instead of the seventh note being a b like it would in c ionian, it would be a b flat. as a metal player, you'll probably pretty much want to ignore this one, along with the lydian. it's useless to you.

dorian: same as mixolydian, but with the third note flattened as well.

lydian: this is played the same as the ionian, but sharp the fourth note. in c lydian, this would mean playing an f sharp instead of an f.

aeolian: better known as the natural minor scale. take the major scale and flatten the third, sixth and seventh notes. the a aeolian scale is relative to c major, meaning it is comprised of the same notes, but played starting on a (a b c d e f g) instead of c (c d e f g a b). for a cooler sound, don't flat the seventh note. that's where you get harmonic minor. soundwise, it sounds kind of eastern european. theoretically, the seventh resolves better to the root when it's not flattened. this is one of my favorite scales. otherwise, take out the second and the sixth to form the minor pentatonic scale. for further modification, add the note between the fourth and the fifth to create a blues scale.

phrygian: take the aeolian scale and also flat the second note. for more fun, take this formula, then sharp the third note. this is the phrygian dominant scale, which is one of the modes of the harmonic minor scale outlined above. megadeth's symphony of destruction is a good example of this.

locrian: take the phrygian mode and then flatten the fifth. this is an interesting scale, being the only mode of which the I chord (the chord formed with the first, third, and fifth tones of the scale) is diminished, meaning it has a minor third and a diminished fifth. the only example i can think of of the locrian is the main riff in machine head's aesthetics of hate. sweet song.

I might add, here in Denmark, we also get: paid sickleave (up to 120 days/year), paid childs-first-sick-day (you can stay at home to take care of your sick child the first day its sick), paid maternity leave (18 weeks for mom, 2 weeks for dad, plus 32 weeks to share between mom and dad).

A nation, nationality, simply means a people.  What didn't exist in is contemporary form-and it's a lot more Industrial Revolution than Enlightenment as large component is the movement away from an agricultural society- was the nation-state, a large political entity made up of a cohesive nation (which of course still doesn't truly exist, but there are enough shared cultural markers to exclude other large groups).  While France became a nation-state shortly after the US did, with other European states to follow, they did not become a nation-state in the same way and are not our sociopolitical contemporaries.  They became nation-states with the nation half of that term based on the historical narratives (factual, manipulated or absurd, it doesn't matter) of the people that occupied those spaces.  So yes, they do have a lot of architecture older than we have in the US (so did the Soviets) and the hundreds or thousands of years of history that went into created those pretty buildings didn't simply disappear when a new political entity appeared.  We both have nation-states, but that nation part, that's pretty important and theirs has a different foundation than ours.

And your argument just goes downhill from there.  First, who owns the highways in the US?  Ownership of private vehicles into the fifties was scarcely higher in much of Western Europe than in was in the Soviet Union.  Those people did the vast majority of their traveling by train, too.

While I'm hesitant to do it, I've had just enough to drink to throw prudence to the wind:  you write like a pretentious first-year history grad student.  You act as though you are taking an ideology seriously, a la Martin Malia, but then you abuse it; you can only bend reality so far to fit a theory (ask Lenin).  You also drop one forced analogy for another.  If want to plunge into theory, you have to be willing to think broadly, not plop something down into the nearest convenient box.  We owned Idaho so we became nomads and thus capitalists?  Have you ever looked a map?  See that giant region between the Volga, the Himalaya and the Pacific?  That was all the Soviet Union, the largest open, unpopulated expanse the world has ever seen held by one government.  Guess the Soviets must have been capitalists.

Yes it is, while I might not necessarily agree with the approach of killing settlers as a solution to end the settlement expansion, the only way to combat settler colonialism (in absence of all alternatives) is to *kill* the settlers. Because, let's face it, they're not going to leave if you ask them nicely, neither will Netanyahu, Obama, or anyone else with power do anything about them. These civilians you're defending are participators in a war crime and are in active violation of [§49 of International law](http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/7c4d08d9b287a42141256739003e636b/6756482d86146898c125641e004aa3c5).

&gt;(Seeing as you forgot the whole part about them trying to kick them out of their houses first)

If you're referring to the Jewish exodus from Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan et al., that began *after* or in parallel to when (Date: 1948) the Palestinians [were getting their asses kicked by Jewish Paramilitaries](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947%E2%80%931948_Civil_War_in_Mandatory_Palestine) (Date: 1947), founding the state of Israel. Palestinians themselves didn't have much to do with the expulsion campaign conducted by the above Arab states. Israel defeated the Palestinians on their own territory, defeated the neighbouring states coming to their aid on said territory 1 year later, resettled the Jewish expellees in their newly-acquired territory (which is far beyond what was originally alloted to them in the partition plan) and the Palestinians were left with 2 Bantustans, a fraction of what used to be their home. But I suppose it would be too much to ask from now-nuclear-armed, regional-superpower Israel to let the Palestinians have their diminished crappy pseudo-state there (or even equals rights as Israeli citizens within Israel).

Frothing-at-mouth pacifists like you might not like it, but that's the only available strategy, aside from giving up, to deal with colonial settlers. Algerian guerillas had to kill tens of thousands of French pied-noirs during the [Algerian War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_War) to drive the point home, so did Eastern Europeans against Generalplan-Ost German settlers in WWII, so did the Vietnamese against the French colonists, so did even the Jews (Irgun/Lehi) against the British (King David Hotel), whom they ironically perceived as unjust occupiers limiting their Zionist ambitions. You're just deluded - colonial settlement was a death-worthy crime back then, and it is still a death-worthy crime now. You're just defending the colonists this time around because they happen to be good at appeals-to-emotion and portraying themselves as victims and ""good guys"", a perception bolstered and enforced by the Western media, and you would most certainly be singing a different tune if the victims and preperators were different.",,1426448935,0,1,1

It doesn't mean that those who don't see things your way are part of some orchestrated conspiracy by the larger organisations who may have something opposed to your way of thinking.  I don't know who this person is you don't like, but he could very well just be a passionate individual who feels he needs to repeat himself against a majority of reddit users who have a different political opinion to himself.

When it comes to net neutrality, I honestly don't know what the fuss is about.  To me it looks like alarmism hyped up to play into the desires of some politicians, and a particular group of content providers who are lobbying to benefit from it.  I'll explain to you why I think so.

I have been an internet user since the very early days of the internet being opened up to private companies.  I even started an ISP shortly afterwards.  I have worked on and off in the telecoms/ISP industry over the years, but I wouldn't say it's my main industry especially nowadays where the margins are lower and I can use my skills in other industries instead.

I have also worked outside of the US in several countries, and it probably is why I find this whole thing so peculiar.  The rest of the world has some pretty fast interwebs out there without any net neutrality protection.  US companies aren't evil at any higher degree than companies in other countries, and nothing stops them from doing all these evil hypothetical stuff that's hyped up to support the desire to legislate it.  Actually many of them have historically done those things but stopped, and there's a reason for it.

When the government institutions started to allow private companies to provide internet access, this access was nothing that could be considered neutral.  People were dialing up using terminal packages to Unix servers and using a limited set of client programs like telnet, ftp, archie, irc, gopher and their email and usenet readers.  Later people actually got tcp/ip connections by using slip and ppp, but this was facilitated by limited software from their online providers that resembled nothing like a neutral connection.   The reason things opened was because a better product is what the consumers always wanted, and that dynamic hasn't changed now.  Over the years I have seen new ISPs with no experience do a lot of stupid things, like enter a market backed by a huge investment and buy up the dial-up customers from many smaller providers, and buying up popular web sites,  and then doing silly things like blocking other ISPs access to the web sites.  I have seen companies with silly charging models like charging users for access per hour, or differential prices based on protocol, etc.  All this stuff happened in the early days of the internet by new businesses who didn't know what they were doing, around the world, without some legislation forcing down a particular business model on them.  However, almost every time a business did something like this it turned out bad for their own business.  The companies doing these things would quickly lose customers and either be forced to open up or go under.  Nothing prevents them from doing the same stuff now, except more people with experience in the industry telling them 'no, you moron'.  The only exception here is in government protected monopolies, like in the many countries out there where the government owns part or all of the monopoly telco and basically makes it illegal for competitors to enter or only issue a few licenses for competitors.  In industries like these the companies can do evil stuff and get away with it and still milk their customers who only have a choice between crap service and no service.

The thing is I believe that generally allowing companies to do evil and stupid things to their customers is a very important thing for the industry in general.  Putting in legislation preventing a business from being stupid will actually entrench the current big players in a market.  What the US really seem to need are two things:
1.  Better competition in the domestic market, there seems to be some kind of block because the most popular medium for this delivery is by cable companies who enjoyed a traditional monopoly protected by their regional governments.
2.  It's also important for legislation and enforcement to make ISPs honest, so that their product descriptions accurately describes what they are offering and the consumer is better informed.

Personally I hope nothing happens with the first, so that something else outside of the system can come in and compete.  I am currently visiting a country where the government only allows limited licenses for fixed line operators.  The ADSL connection in this house is pretty shoddy, like $20/month for a 384k/sec line and it's contended to hell so you're lucky if facebook even works properly.  However, there's much better competition in the mobile phone market.  I get considerably better service over 3G, comparable to 512k/sec ADSL in Europe.  Actually there are countries in Africa with almost no legislation regulating their telecoms, a journalist we have contact with visite, I think it was Uganda, and his taxi driver was busy watching his World Cup football games from his mobile phone.

I'm not saying wireless is the answer.  I'm just saying the current method of delivery is not the start and the end.  Remember in the US the internet was delivered to people in their homes through telephone lines and their telephone companies.  Fortunately nothing prevented cable companies to compete in that market, and that's why they can offer a more competitive service.   Unfortunately they're dominating the market at the moment, just like phone companies used to, and can get away with sucking to some degree.

The solution to this is not to 'price fix' or 'quality fix' the major providers.  I don't believe I have to go into detailed arguments about why these things are bad for the consumer.",,1426448947,0,1,1

And, just so as you know, the British ""rule"" as you call it ended in 1965 when Ian Smith declared independence, so the real question is ""is life better now for Zimbabwe than it would have been under Ian Smith?"". In other words, the British weren't ruling anymore by the time war broke out.

And let's consider that for a moment: you're saying that civil war is better than what's going on in zimbabwe.

A few facts:
* In 1969, the constitution was modified. The most significant 1969 modification was the formal separation of two electoral rolls by race. The A roll was reserved for Europeans and the B roll for non-Europeans. The Assembly constituencies were reformed so that there were 50 A roll, and 8 B roll seats. In addition, the tribal chiefs were able to elect another 8 members. Effectively, the result was that 270,000 whites had 50 seats and 6 million Africans had 16 seats in the Assembly.

* From August 1964 to December 1974, Robert Mugabe was imprisoned without trial

* By 1975, although officially democratic, the regime had started to lock up even peaceful opponents of white domination

Robert Mugabe is a DIRECT RESULT of Ian Smith's racist rule. 

To answer your question: yes, as bad as it is now, it's better than a civil war and (b) it is most certainly better in the long term for Zimbabwe to have it's racist colonist and colonialist masters removed.

* It was quite a while ago, and the time may have something to do with it.  There were *gobs* of battles in Europe under Napoleon, and I don't see all that many games about that.

* Limited familiarity and appeal compared to some of the alternatives.  I expect that most US students are familiar with the ACW, but I doubt that it plays a huge role in most European schools.  You don't see many games based on, say, the Korean War either.

*  The tatics that they used (units moving together in lines, charges over open fields, etc) are closer to a class of tactics that date back thousands of years, and on their way out -- you could turn units and they could be clobbered by firepower.  If you want games in that genre, there are a lot of other times to choose from.

* For the same reasons, the gameplay is a bit limited.  If you want to make an FPS, being a soldier in a line isn't quite as much fun as operating more independently and finding your own way across terrain.

True, but I was more agreeing with you and speculating as to causes than trying to convert anyone - in a debate with someone who believed strongly in Libertarianism I'd try to be a lot more circumspect and polite, and would refrain from the armchair psychology. ;-)

I also agree that in principle, with the right education, you could probably raise children who would successfully apply Libertarian ideals... at least for a time, and in a small enough community.

However, as generations pass and social rules drift, and as the community grows and more and more people have to live and work together I can see it becoming increasingly strained until the whole thing breaks down in a way that mixed Capitalism-plus-regulation (or even better, here in Europe -Capitalism-plus-social-safety-net) is unlikely to.

And arguably even more importantly than this pure-theoretical approach, what many people who advocate Libertarianism (or Communism, or whatever) seem to miss is that we *can't* just kill everyone and start again with a small group of newborn babies on an island somewhere.

I had to pay about £200 for an ER visit in Sweden because I didn't have an EHIC (European Health Insurance Card), this was due to poor planning on my part. Other than that I've never had to pay anything other than minimal charges for prescriptions (£5 quid or so).

I have private healthcare insurance through my employer in the UK and have never felt the need to use it. One of my colleagues who suffered an aneurism did make use of it and found the main difference to be quality of food and a private (rather than shared) room, with no difference in actual medical care.

Generally I would say that the UK system is good, although not quite as good as the Swedish system. A lot of the infrastructure is aging and generally I think the UK could benefit from severe cuts on the admin side, reducing the emphasis on management by numbers and redirecting efforts towards investment in modernising equipment and facilities while also increasing the number of nurses.",,1426449003,0,5,5

Without some organization, we are reduced to hunter/gatherers since progress will only come with pooled resources.

As an anarchist, I have to disagree. Anarchism does not require the absence of organization. In fact, I think it would be impossible to have anarchism without substantial organization. Anarchism only requires that hierarchies and coercive organizations are abolished. To do that. anarchists need to create a parallel voluntary system of organization to develop alongside the state, and to eventually replace it. 

Organization of the voluntary kind is what anarchism is all about. This is why we participate in [Food Not Bombs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_not_bombs), organize [Really Really Free Markets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Really_Really_Free_Market), operate [Free Stores](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_store), start [worker's co-ops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worker_cooperative) and [trade unions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union), and establish [communes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commune). If you take a look at [anarcho-syndicalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism), for example, the strategy is to form directly-democratic voluntary labor syndicates, organize them into a federation, and then work together to overthrow capitalism and the government together. The [CNT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederaci%C3%B3n_Nacional_del_Trabajo)-[FAI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federaci%C3%B3n_Anarquista_Ib%C3%A9rica) used this strategy quite effectively during the [Spanish Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_revolution). They created pure anarchy successfully. 

&gt;Please, show me another way that adheres to the pure liberty an anarchist or libertarian craves but enables the same progress while not having the same inherent problems.

George Orwell fought in the Spanish revolution on the side of Marxists and anarchists, against fascists. He [wrote a book](http://www.george-orwell.org/Homage_to_Catalonia/index.html) about it. I'll quote him:

&gt;I had dropped more or less by chance into the only community of any size in Western Europe where political consciousness and disbelief in capitalism were more normal than their opposites. Up here in Aragon one was among tens of thousands of people, mainly though not entirely of working-class origin, all living at the same level and mingling on terms of equality. **In theory it was perfect equality, and even in practice it was not far from it.** There is a sense in which it would be true to say that one was experiencing a foretaste of Socialism, by which I mean that the prevailing mental atmosphere was that of Socialism. Many of the normal motives of civilized life--snobbishness, money-grubbing, fear of the boss, etc.--had simply ceased to exist. The ordinary class-division of society had disappeared to an extent that is almost unthinkable in the money-tainted air of England; there was no one there except the peasants and ourselves, and **no one owned anyone else as his master.**

&gt;**There was no unemployment, and the price of living was still extremely low; you saw very few conspicuously destitute people, and no beggars except the gypsies. Above all, there was a belief in the revolution and the future, a feeling of having suddenly emerged into an era of equality and freedom. Human beings were trying to behave as human beings and not as cogs in the capitalist machine.**",,1426449043,0,2,2

This is not written by law, but offered as a free market incentive.  In other words, it is a benefit to entice someone to work for you.  Don't offer a decent enough benefit package, and a person won't accept the position.  Granted, all of this is for salaried employees.

Because at that point you are redefining what would normally be defined as the Axis powers.  

&gt;Spain has been geopolitically irrelevant since 1938.

True, but the point is that even as a notionally fascist regime, Spain saw some support from the US (with both direct aid and lobbying at the UN).  The idea that with the victory in Europe, fascism ended isn't quite accurate, although for the purpose of this discussion it probably doesn't add anything.

&gt;...a full 28 years after the October Revolution and 88 years after Das Kapital. Which pretty much covers the rest of your objections

Not really.  The point is that things like the concept of social housing or collective bargaining and unionisation didn't come out of a fully formed ideology (and predate both the October Revolution and Das Kapital, the NHS does indeed come later.).  that was to eventually lead to the creation of the Soviet Union, they predated the formal presentation of a cohesive ideology and probably (almost inevitably) build upon ideas that were already present. Hell Unionisation predates but no doubt feeds into the publication of the Communist Manifesto too.  

In short, I don't think that we can tie socialist positions and ideas directly to either a Marxist tradition or new political thinking, but rather that industrialisation, war (and in the UK, the breakdown of Empire).  I would certainly agree that the US stood clear due to the Cold war, but not that Europe played one side off against the other for ideas.

The problem is that many people listen to the lies of the extremely wealthy (it happens over here too) and thus vote against 'socialist' healthcare (even accepting socialism == evil as an axiom) and other policies. I saw a few poor people in LA and it seemed pretty bad and I was just a tourist, likewise I didn't like the pressure to tip in restaurants because your labour laws don't cover service workers.

Your education system seems less advanced than in the UK - but then I did the hardest A levels I could, I suppose if a child studied AP classes etc. they would be just as well educated but then you need to be at a good school whereas I was able to self-study the classes my school didn't teach and they would enter me for the exams.

The religious aspect is strange - I'm not a raving atheist but I think religion goes too far in the United States sometimes.

I think in general it is a nice place, and if it wasn't for the healthcare issues I'd consider moving there. The levels of inequality and things like gun control etc. are bad but ultimately unlikely to affect me if I moved there and was relatively wealthy. I'd hate to be born poor in the US though - it seems much, much worse than being poor in Europe. 

On the whole I think I'd rather live in France or Germany. Scandinavia is probably the best as you don't have to worry about healthcare or education costs etc. so it's a less stressful place to have a family or live in general but it's also pretty damn cold.

Tl;dr The people seem nice (but then I find that pretty much anywhere?), the weather is good in CA and I'd consider moving there when I'm older (in university at the moment ) as I would already have an education and career etc. but I'd hate to be born poor in the US as it seems awful.",,1426449102,0,9,9

GDP growth in and of itself may be a decent measure overall, but in this context it is relatively meaningless.  It is a lot easier to grow a small economy in a relatively undeveloped country than it is to grow a large, well established economy.  After all, if you're making a dollar per day, and you make one extra dollar, you've grown 100%, but if you're making $50 per day and you make an extra dollar, you've grown 2%.  Looking at per-capita GDP growth based on PPP makes a lot more sense, and things look very different when you look at those numbers.  For instance, you cited Italy and Spain versus Nigeria, the 2009 per-capita GDP's (PPP-adjusted) for the European nations are ~ $35k and $31k, respectively, while Nigeria barely tops $1,100.  Clearly, this isn't a measure of standard of living, but it does show that looking at GDP growth rates is a dubious way to say how countries are doing. 

The other thing to look at in Nigeria is their oil reserves... Most African nations are, unfortunately for the ordinary citizen, blessed with a lot of resources.  The corruption at the top, and the amount of resources that MNCs wield make it inevitable that the people will see little of the wealth generated by their resources, a fact that will always make any overall growth measure that much less meaningful.

A lot depends on how the Republican party ultimately postures itself with relation to the Tea Party.

It's not entirely their fault.  They share a third of the world with two other countries, which they could try harder to understand, but they aren't forced to see as many different cultural views as you would be in Europe so they become self-centered as a result.

The cold war also left a solid two generations (possibly three) with the ""us or them"" mentality that helps guide the country down a path of myopic protectionism which won't change until everyone over 40 dies off.  It's also left a bad taste in everyone's mouth about socialism (which is entirely different from communism) which prevents the country from making any groundbreaking advances in human rights.

Past experiences talking with 'patriotic' Americans have helped me understand what they mean by ""freedom"".  Personally, I don't entirely agree but I can appreciate how their lack of an outside perspective and a unique constitution has led to the opinion that low taxation and gun ownership is more important than a high quality of living.

Libertarians oppose aggression and control. It does not matter if an organization that institutionalizes violence _admits_ to being a government or not. The Catholic Church of the European Dark Ages, for example, was a government, despite its insistence that it was actually a church.

As for checking power, it is obviously the case that individuals do not always, or even usually, succeed in defending themselves against coercion. The fact that you and I pay 60% of our income in taxes is clear proof of this. However, libertarians _continue_ to oppose aggression even when one institution of aggression aggresses against another institution of aggression.

Thus whereas the progressives want the government to bully and rob a bunch of corporations, the libertarians want to philosophically undermine the concept of bullying and robbing. We will not attack, period. We may defend, when it is pragmatically reasonable to do so.

Lets see. BIG. That really does encompass everything, and is what most people don't get. Think about all of Europe. Now imagine that's all one country, with half the population density.

Why else is this important? Well. Imagine the difficulty in getting something like healthcare passed in one european country. Not too bad. Now imagine the difficulty in passing one law that every country in the continent of Europe would agree on.

This also explains our affinity for cars. Quite frankly, it's pretty damn near impossible to cover the US (except for the coasts) with public transit, because everything is so far apart and not large enough.

What else. We like guns. A lot of our rural population DOES hunt, and we don't look at the military with contempt. Honestly, there's been many places I've been hiking/camping where I would prefer to have one myself.

My question: does reddit want to be a smartass culture or a smart culture?     


A little education: Yiddish was once spoken by ca. 12 million living human beings. For context, that's more than there are speakers of Swedish, Hebrew, Hmong, Bulgarian and Tibetan.  It's *twice as many* as there are estimated to be current speakers of Norwegian, Danish, Finnish and Kashmiri.  It's more than *three times* as many as there are estimated to be current speakers of Lithuanian, and more than *ten times* as many as there are estimated to be current speakers of Estonian.  


These twelve millions, who together sustained film industries and  theater industries on two continents that produced multiple crossover stars, along with dozens of major daily newspapers in multiple countries, including the United States, saw a decline in their flourishing when global antisemitism reached an all-time high and a pan-European scheme to methodically exterminate them--which began with the burning of their books--took years to draw the outrage of the rest of the world.  At present, there are approximately 3 million speakers of Yiddish worldwide, which is still more than three times as many as there are speakers of Estonian. 

I don't claim any special privilege for Jewish suffering. There are holocausts and other massive crimes going on all around us, at all times: this summer, [the systematic raping of more than 250 women took place right under the U. N.'s noses.](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/26/world/africa/26congo.html).  Several of the languages named above are spoken by oppressed peoples, or the formerly oppressed. I encourage everyone to start a subreddit for every language group to collect and preserve its culture, and spread awareness of its value.

2002-MAR: Nigeria: Safiya Hussaini, 33, was convicted of adultery. She was sentenced to be buried up to her neck in sand and to be stoned to death. However, her sentence was deferred until her 13-month-old daughter has finished nursing. She appealed her conviction. Her cousin, a Mr. Abubakar allegedly confessed to police that he had sex with her three times. However, the judge dismissed the testimony of the three policemen who witnessed Abubakar's confession, because a minimum of four witnesses are required under Sharia law. Hussaini's lawyers claimed that she also could not be convicted because of the four witness rule. The prosecution argued that witnesses were not required in her case; adultery had obviously taken place because she had become pregnant. Her defense team finally argued that, under Islamic law, the interval between conception and birth can be up to seven years! Only two years previous to the birth of her daughter, she was still married to her husband. The lawyers argued that her husband could possibly have been the father. Commenting on the conviction, Aliyu Abubakar Sanyinna, the attorney general of Sokoto State, said: ""Society is injured by her act. The danger is that it will teach other women to do the same thing."" 9 Mansur Ibrahim Said, Dean of the Law Faculty at Dakar University in Sokoto said that adultery is ""an abomination abhorred by God and society because of the example it gives and because it creates bastards to be rejected by society.""   9

The appeals court later reversed the lower court conviction. They ruled that the alleged act had taken place before Sharia law was activated in the province, and adultery became a criminal offence. There was strong international interest in her case. The European Union, the parliament of Italy and many non-governmental organizations, appealed for Safiya to be spared. 10 In 2002-JUL, she married an entertainer in her local village.

' The enduring lesson of the Holocaust and the genocides that followed is that they occurred not simply because of the machinery of death, but because of state-sanctioned incitement to hate.  The genocide of European Jewry succeeded not only because of the culture of hate and industry of death, but because of crimes of indifference and conspiracies of silence – another lesson of the Holocaust.

' There’s a third lesson – one that emerges not so much from the Holocuast itself as from its aftermath.  This lesson is that remembrance requires active effort and reflection.  For the relativizing pressure of contemporary events are great, and the lessons of the Holocaust risk losing their value if the tragedy of the Holocaust is invoked to fit every case of moral outrage.

According to [this](http://www.ambienteinsular.uac.pt/artigos5.htm) website the Azores still get most of their energy from fossil fuels. That's no good because it requires a large world wide distribution infrastructure. However, there seem to be some solar energy initiatives. So let's say ""me and other survivors"" are three people, and we live in a solar powered house.

The reddit servers are in San Francisco, according to [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/a2zte/i_run_reddits_servers_and_do_a_bunch_of_other/). [These](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Gas_and_Electric_Company#Generation_portfolio) are the energy sources of San Francisco. I'm going to take a guess and say the solar powered plant is the one that needs the least employees to run, let's say 100. Let's also guess that it takes about 10 people to maintain electric lines all the way to the reddit servers. And let's allow at least one of the reddit admins to survive. Since wikipedia still exists, he can learn how to maintain his own [transformer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer). So far we have at least 114 people.

It seems from the data in [this pdf](http://ec.europa.eu/energy/energy_policy/doc/factsheets/mix/mix_nl_en.pdf) that it would require too many people to maintain energy generation in the Netherlands. Of the [energy sources](http://www.energy.gov/florida.htm) of Florida, it seems like a nuclear power plant would require the least people to maintain. Let's assume they have enough Uranium to run for a while, and they can get some more from the other plants in Florida. And let's guesstimate that you need about two hundred people to keep one of these plants running. Again, let's leave ten people for the power transmission lines and have one wiki guy maintaining the servers and his own transformer. That leaves us with about 325 people.

Swedish CS undergrad here. Did you take tuition charges into account for your expenses? Because I'm pretty sure you won't have to pay tuition at a Swedish university. Starting next fall, people from outside the EU will not have their tuition paid for by the Swedish state and must pay it themselves. But since you are a Bulgarian citizen I'm pretty sure this doesn't apply to you, I'm not 100% sure though. I'm not sure about grants, they are almost unheard of over here since we don't pay tuition and we get a subsidy + guaranteed student loan from the evil socialist state. The ones you will find are very small (50-300$ per month) and almost exclusively geared towards Swedish students fulfilling some strange requirement as they are given by private individuals.

You will have no problem getting admitted to a Master's program in CS. There are unfilled seats every year even though we get many international students. It's not a very popular field in Sweden (believe it or not), so as long as you fulfill the minimum requirements you will get in. It will be even easier starting next fall since there will be a drop in non-EU applicants as some of the Swedish appeal might be a free education with no strings attached.

The Master's level programs, at least at my university (Uppsala), are held in English so there will be no requirement to learn Swedish. Have fun.",,1426449415,0,2,2

1. I've walked past it 100 times, but never went inside, as is with all the cathedrals and churches in Nuremberg. The most interesting thing I saw was the wall outside of the inner-city had bullet marks on it, to look like it held through WWII, but it actually didn't, it was completely destroyed and when rebuilding they intentionally put those marks there (this is what I've heard from a tour guide). Strangest thing was probably dishes made with rabbit or deer (I'm vegetarian), I've heard of people eating these things before, but its quite a delicacy in the area I stayed at. Most beautiful was the Christmas Market on a clear day, since it takes place in front of the Frauenkirche. The Frauenkirche looms behind all these little tents selling food, crafts, christmas-y things.. It was really neat. 
3. Best time of year is Christmas, hands down. I love snow, and I love all the sweets that come out during Christmas time. Lebkuchen, Marzipan, Pfeffernusse! 
4. I was in student housing and had a monthly stipend, so let me give you a perspective of my budget: I paid about 200 euros a month for my dorm, which was a studio, included a stovetop, fridge and a little bathroom. Essentially, I didn't have to share anything with anyone, which was really nice (not that I dont like to share, but I can get a little picky about how I live). After rent, I had 200 euros left over from the Stipend for Groceries. Being vegetarian I could probably buy enough food to last a month on 100, but I always went for organic/natural things, so it cost a little more. As with electricity, As long as you're turning your stuff off, you're not paying more than 20 euros per month in a room the size of mine. Travelling, if planned well ahead of time can be cheap, and there is even a huge carpooling network through Germany that is cheaper than trains. I'd say in most places a car is unneccesary, because public transit is so thorough and affordable. 
5. Most younger Germans and educated older (35/40+) speak English. The only time I've come across a younger German not speaking English at all are immigrants from Eastern Europe.

Israel has been trying to grab as much land as it can. The whole goal is to create 'facts on the ground.' The whole goal is to entrench themselves so deep that they have effectively annexed the whole area. 

Before the 67 war there was east and west Jerusalem. The Jews lived in West Jerusalem, the Arabs in East Jerusalem. After the war, the whole area came under Israeli control, but the demographics remained the same. 

Over time, Israel has extended more and more control. They have made it their goal to have Jerusalem as their undivided capital and have worked for 30 years to insure this. The old Arab neighborhoods are now surrounded by a ring of Jewish settlements on the east, cutting them off from the rest of the West Bank.

Inside the Arab neighborhoods, Israel has been engaging in what amounts to a ethnic cleansing by bureaucracy. Imagine going to some Arab family's house, which is 300 years old, and telling them 'oops, we don't have a building permit on file for this, I guess you'll have to tear it down.' 

The Arab population is slowly being forced out, and East Jerusalem will soon be majority Jewish. Regardless of what the international community may want or what this official says, Israel has invested far too much to just give up East Jerusalem now.",,1426449421,0,10,10

For so long it was my dream to live there and it still is, I don't necessarily want to *grow old* there but it's somewhere I'd like to live.

I'm 18 now and have lived in quite a few different places around the world so I'm a pretty international guy. Because I've moved around quite a bit, I've pretty much been only influenced by American pop culture and media; films (obviously), music, television, fashion but not sports. With that said, I always had this idea that my way of living/lifestyle would be much easier if I lived in America.

I've been to America three times in the last three years: Florida, Boston, New York (in that order). I loved it; I like eating, so food and eating out there was great, service was generally good and not only in restaurants but anywhere you go. I'm aware of the fact that tipping has something to do with it, but I did meet lots of genuinely friendly and polite people.

Now having lived in Europe for the last six and a half years, two of which I attended a largely American populated school, I heard complaints daily about how *shit* Europe is and this and that. Americans complained over the most insignificant things like not being able to find powdered sugar icing ""anywhere in this country"" and so on.

The next most frequent thing I would hear is how *awesome* America is. I'd like to point out how OP said
&gt; This isn't a US vs the World thing.

I can't tell you how many times I've had discussions with Americans about anything and to them it actually was either America or somewhere else.... And these are people **living** somewhere else. [MDKrouzer](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/d8ni1/be_honest_reddit_what_do_you_really_think_about/c0yd2jc) mentioned that this USA-centric attitude comes from the fact that the rest of the World isn't as easily accessible to Americans than it is to pretty much everybody else. From my experience socializing and interacting with Americans living here (some of them for two, three, four, five years) this isn't entirely correct.

Don't get me wrong, I've made some really close American friends and some less-close ones, and I do not hold these kinds of annoyances against them because like others have said; each individual is different.

For The Nay (in no particular order)

* Even Colbert isn't funny anymore, his sponsor Bud Lite tastes like old lady water.

* Brutalist buildings everywhere, little architecture older than 100 years. 9th century churches are old, anything else is not.

* Complete corporate domination of every aspect of living and dying. And The Colbert Report.

* Driving too much because everything is too far away. They spend so much time driving they even have cup holders in there. Mental.

* Biking everywhere is either impossible due to lack of infrastructure or is reserved for righteous privileged people in spandex who hate you.

* Unnecessary superficial politeness quickly leads to intrusive, shameless drivel about;

1. Food or favorite restaurants, or the different foods they like to talk about while eating food in a restaurant and talking about restaurants and food.

2. Bad TV shows.

3. Fervent ramblings to anyone or nobody about something they did/might do/are doing to make themselves different or interesting.

* Few watchable TV shows, with truly evil commercials every 7 minutes, for 3 minutes. Seriously.

* Big cheap stuff.

* Big cheap people.

* Scary weather events.

* Scary lack of comprehensive social/health programs.

* Scary wealth gap.

* Scary ignorance of the outside world.

* Scary waste.

TL;DR - I'm moving back to Europe in March, after 6 years in purgatory.  Don't ever come to live here. Generally speaking Americans are humorless droids that work too hard and drink too little.

Guilty as charged.  From an economical vs. historical perspective, it made sense.  It was more confusing than it needed to be.

&gt;Not really. The point is that things like the concept of social housing or collective bargaining and unionisation didn't come out of a fully formed ideology (and predate both the October Revolution and Das Kapital, the NHS does indeed come later.).

Wasn't really the point I was trying to make - the point I was making is that it was through exposure to successful examples of socialism that socialist ideas gained traction in Europe, while in the United States a shunning of all similar ideas produced a hypercapitalist society.

&gt;In short, I don't think that we can tie socialist positions and ideas directly to either a Marxist tradition or new political thinking, but rather that industrialisation, war (and in the UK, the breakdown of Empire). I would certainly agree that the US stood clear due to the Cold war, but not that Europe played one side off against the other for ideas.

I have lived in Ecuador, Costa Rica, mexico and several cities in Brazil and the US in the past 30 years. Ethnically, I'm a mix of Hispanic (whatever that means), Polish, German, North African and Native Soth American.

I would say the following about living abroad:
1.- Latin America is not, by any means, a coherent group of ""Hispanic"" people. A person from Mexico City (22 million people in a country of more than 100 million) is a completely different being from someone in Alajuela, Costa Rica, a city with 50 thousand people in a country of only 3 million.
2.- Brazilians are pretty much the same as Americans in the sense that they are influenced their gigantic country, with so many subcultures, weather, regions and socioeconomic development that is just as diverse as the US.
3.- California IS a different country. It just happens to be part of a federation with a common currency among 50 political entities. Pretty much as any EU country. There are obvious differences between the US and the EU, but I think you get the point. And no Austrian bodybuilder would ever be elected as president of France.

* The law appears to be incredibly stupid. You do something very minor and end up in jail for like 5 years. There's also the death penalty in some states and when a country allows death penalty you can only wonder what kind of people live there, how can they allow that to exist?

* Healthcare costs an arm and a leg, everything there is about having money = in the US if you don't have money you might as well go die in a corner because no one cares.

* Things there seem to be getting harsh in terms of civil liberties.

* Age of consent. Although this is not a deal breaker it makes me wonder how some states only allow a person to start fucking when people get to 18. Are you kidding me?

* That ""people of walmart"" website scared me shitless

* The way you treat mexicans on the border

The good:

* American movies and tv shows, video games too.

* NOFX, System of a Down, Jack Johnson, Nine Inch Nails, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Moby, Lady Gaga, Shiny Toy Guns and a lot more great musicians and singers.

This guy has it right on principle, but Pat has it right with regard to the real world implications of the influx of Islam in Western civilization. And you really need to make that distinction.

In the real world politicians don't have the guts to stand up against the tyranny of Islam. I see this in my own country, and all across Europe. The simple fact of the matter is that when a certain percentage of the population of a city is Islamic (usually between 5% and 15%) they begin to demand certain special privileges which basically puts them outside the normal state of law (for example setting up Sharia courts). And when these individuals don't get what they demand, they are not shy of threatening the indigenous population or even use violence. And here is when Islam departs from the Western culture. 

Now in principle the Bill of Rights would protect us from such a downturn, as many other constitutions throughout European countries are supposed to, but in practice it simply doesn't. Politicians are the same everywhere, they choose the path of least resistance and that leads to dhimmitude. Basically it comes down to this: you cannot tolerate intolerance. What the answer is to this problem, I really don't know. On the one hand we have the principles of a free society which we don't want to tread on, but on the other hand we have a growing Muslim population, many of which are against those same principles.

*The Spirit - While some Americans tend to overdo it, I like the American sense of pride and the common belief, instilled in us by Saturday morning cartoons and blockbuster films, that you can do anything even if the odds are against you.

**And then there's the bad (yeah, we're not perfect):**

*Politics - Our voters are uninformed and our politicians take advantage of it. I'm actually running for public office because I want to try and do something about it. Our system is flawed, but it's also a lot younger than most European governments.

*Know-It-All, Do-Nothings - I am constantly reminded by the ""intellectuals"" that our nation is in a state of unrest and irrational folks like the teabaggers are trying to turn us into a theocracy, but when asked, ""What can we do?"" they simply respond with pessimistic rants about how one person can't make a difference (clearly they didn't watch the cartoons). These are the same people who like to tell me I'm not going to win the election in November (as if that were the point).

I've been there a number of times and i've dated women from there (which probably affects my judgement). I'm from Ireland, for a start. The thing i hate about America is mainly the narcissism. The people are so self-obsessed and they live such shallow, uncultured lives. Of course, not everybody is like that, i understand. But the majority seem to be.

I think that's why i prefer the south, people seem much more humble and simpler. Apart from all the religious crap and country music, it's quite charming. Now don't get me started on the psychologist attitude that everybody seems to have. Which falls into the self-obsession category. Hypochondriac drama queens. There is a stark difference between Europeans in this matter. We're much more relaxed in our minds.

Then again, after seeing the culture, it's understandable why the people are they way they are. Constant ads about drugs and just the whole information overload and hyper consumerism. I see the country as a mass sociological experiment. I'm just not sure if it has gone wrong or gone right. I hate how it's a social norm to be religious. Even people who aren't religious will say they are, just to be considered normal. I've seen how atheists are treated, it's a disgrace.

Now onto the things i enjoy about the country. People seem to be much friendlier and optimistic than Europeans. I'm not sure if this is all the drugs you guys swallow, but it's pleasant. I like the innovation you guys used to have. I like the illusory free speech. I like American movies way more than shitty British movies. I like the diversity of the land. You can go to different states and it would be considered a holiday, since they're so different from one another. 

I used to wanna live in America. But after spending some months there, i was really homesick. And i live in the shittiest war-torn part of Ireland and i hate it. Britain in general depresses me. I hate the culture, the people and their attitudes. Ideally, i'd like to live elsewhere in Europe, possibly France.

My impression of Canadians is that they are gentle, kind, and transparent people. Particularly, I was impressed with the people's attitudes east of Calgary and west of Montreal. No social drama. I'm looking right now at countries I might want to emigrate to - and Canada is definitely on the short list. That country looks like it would provide fertile soil to allow me to build the kind of life I want for myself.

I attribute the beauty of Canada to the publishing laws which they have - and the mainstream media ethics which have sprouted up around that. The news is reported in a well-contextualized and transparent manner, and in a way that really appeals to simple-minded people. 

I was on a trip through the USA and Canada last summer, and my conclusion was that simple-minded folks are the ones who create the character of any given region. Intellectuals are more homogeneous from place to place. So, a nation which takes good care of the ordinary folks is the one which becomes a happy and a healthy place to live.

I was particularly impressed, riding the Greyhound bus between Regina and Calgary, to have a long conversation with a guy who would be stigmatized in the USA as a ""redneck."" He worked on oil pipelines, was of european descent, overweight, and had a jovial and impish sense of humor. He was overtly trying to make the conversation with me constructive and helpful to me as a tourist. I never run across people who will reach out to me that way, down here, in the States. I do it myself. But no one else seems to think it's important to be that gracious.

Another point of reference was a conversation I had with a guy over on the Transcanada Highway through northern Ontario - he was probably retarded - but he was so peaceful and happy - with bright shining eyes. It was such a pleasure to chat with him.

The folks of ethnic minority groups - African Americans for example - looked like they were finding fulfillment and  social success in their lives.

Bus drivers made requests of passengers instead of demands. Their schedules were on time. Bus passengers generally felt that they were ordinary middle class people.

These and other interactions provided a lot of food for thought. If people in Canada take such good care of those who elsewhere would suffer stigma... I think it really creates an excellent social fabric. 

In contrast, once I crossed the border back into the USA - bus drivers became arrogant, bus passengers felt they were lower class, and busses were routinely late. You started seeing the chips growing on people's shoulders. The further south you traveled, the bigger the chip. I found it so ironic that there was this ""fight the man"" kind of emotional drama among young men on the Greyhound bus in the USA - when all they would have to do is move to Canada to rid themselves of the US government and its social structures - and perhaps find the fulfillment in life which they wanted.

My father has worked in the NHS for getting on 40 years (currently a consultant radiologist), so I've heard it all.

1) Any good health service is a victim of its own success; the more people you help live longer, the more people you have to look after. With ageing populations (as in the UK/Europe but not the US) this creates a big problem in ever expanding healthcare costs. This is partially accounted for in something known as 'NHS Inflation', which is typically much higher then national inflation (8%-10%-ish).

2) Its always a struggle to attract the right management staff to the public sector, as it means setting salaries that compete with comparable private sector jobs. This can create friction between hospital staff (lowly paid nurses and highly paid middle-managers). But if you don't get the right people in those positions you can end up wasting a lot more money then you save.

3) The NHS is a political football, and politicians often do not make decisions for the right reasons.

4) Funding is controlled by availability not demand, and hospitals can sink fighting for the extra staff they need to meet the targets imposed on them by government.

5) Target-driven working culture - if you don't meet a throughput target you loose money next year. This means the system is designed for speed and good headlines, not efficiency. The Government might get to release a headline saying '95% of all patients seen by a specialist within 7 days of GP referral', but those patients might not get a follow-up appointment or diagnosis for months afterwards as a consequence.

6) Some people will always abuse pubic services - 20-somethings get them selves too drunk then go to the emergency department in an ambulance to get their stomach pumped, all at the tax payers expense.

7) Pass-the-buck culture; GP's will sometimes refer on pointless cases because it costs them nothing to do so. Radiologists like my father then get requests like 'sore foot-please scan' at a cost of a few hundred pounds to the tax payer, when all the patient really needs is to swallow anti-inflammatories and take it easy. Doctors are over-cautious due to the risks of lawsuits, and because there is no reason not to be. 

8) Rationing is inevitable; Fox news has that right (well sort-of right). You can't fund everything for everyone from the public purse. We have a group called NICE who decides if new treatments give benefits worth their cost, and that avoids the (frankly a bit ridiculous) drugs-that-dont-really-do-anything-but-cost-lots culture in the US, but controversy is inevitable here. Every decision you make will be challenged by someone.

9) Private or Public - the NHS is a system of total equality; the judge and the janitor getting the same treatment on the same ward. If you want private healthcare you have to go completely private and fund everything yourself. But this can seem unfair to the middle class who can afford individual treatments but not the whole thing, and so can't get the more expensive cancer treatments that the NHS won't fund (but that you can get in the US on insurance).

10) Allowing 'top-up' treatments is being considered (and also being heavily pushed by American Pharma companies keen to open up the UK's middle-class market) but this would inevitably create a two-tier system of 'haves' and 'have-nots'. 

I'm a big fan of the NHS and wouldn't swap it for the world, but that doesn't mean we can pretend its without some serious problems and that we could learn something from countries with combination public/private healthcare systems.",Northamptonshire,1426449599,0,6,6

I've visited at least once every state west of the Mississippi and quite a few east of it (never been to NYC but that's on the list next)... but I've only ever been to Canada. :P I'm 27, so you 'old timers' or whatever can call me out on the age thing.

Here is how I view America:

1. Our politics are corrupt, everyone knows it. We *all* want to fix it, but we can't decide on how to do it because we're too many countries. Imagine taking the UK and Germany and telling them that they had to live under one government. Not under the EU where everyone can negotiate to make things 'acceptable' and where you can generally keep your own laws as is, but under one actual 'that guy speaks for all of us' country. Of course we're not going to accomplish anything - all the 'normal' people want to fix the system but we're so busy fighting among ourselves that all the people in power, who want the system the way it is because it benefits them, have to do is fan the flames of all the factions and keep us bickering like little children. 

2. As a nation, we aren't greedy, but we don't want to be 'told' that we have to help others. When many of us are 'told' that we have to pay a new tax so the bum on the street can get healthcare, we feel like the government is trying to play robin hood, but we know that THEY are the corrupt ones, not us. However, *individuals* here can be very greedy and the system, being as corrupt as it is, is very easy for them to exploit.

3. As a nation, we buy into the propaganda that is fed to us entirely too well. We are still fighting with cold-war attitudes where people think that anything we do to make us more socialist is going to turn us into communist Russia overnight. The majority of us have little understanding (or honestly, much time to think about) the many and vast differences between Socialism and Communism. We also believe that anything that is communist is bad (though china is helping to sway that opinion some. believe it or not, we kinda like china, or maybe that's personal...) 

4. Most of us believe that the bum on the street, and everyone else for that matter, DESERVES to get health care. We just don't like the idea of doing it like everyone else does it. Instead, we have to do it the 'American' way, which translates to 'I-dunno-wtf-we're-going-to-do-but-that-ain't-it' way. Individualism is the primary tenant of our lives. There is nothing more radical that happens in our lives than gaining our 'freedom' (aka a car).

5. Some of us are 'fundamentalist christians' the way that some Muslims are 'fundamentalist muslims', but in general the 'faith' in America is receding, much to the chagrin of everyone who preaches that we'll burn in hell unless we give them our time and money.

6. We watch too much tv. We believe too much of what we watch.

7. We are some of the most caring, kind-hearted, genuinely open people on the planet. I am proud to be one of them. I just wish that we could make this into compelling news. 

8. We're pessimists. That just means we work twice as hard because we *know* something is going to go wrong. Usually we're proved right, usually we're not ready for it despite the extra work.

9. We've by-and-large abdicated our responsibility to further human understanding to other countries because of 'corporate interests', which means we are happy to take the wild-and-crazy stuff that science is doing right now and make it practical, usable, day-to-day stuff. This helps our bottom line, but has done terrible things to the 'soul' of our nation.

10. We all believe that major change is coming. The US cannot continue down the path that it is on. Either liberals (aka 'moderates' to the rest of the world) will push hard enough that it will ease the pressure on the system and things will get better, or the nutcase-far-right-ultra-conservative will capture the attention of just enough of us that things are going to end up in a bloody, bloody mess (aka violence). 

11. Finally, as a nation, we have bought way to far into consumerist culture, as if it is our god-given-right to have that new iPhone. The negative savings rate is what is really killing this country. If you're European, imagine the stress of not having any savings AT ALL, and knowing that if something happens you have to put it on a credit card, except almost all of your credit cards are maxed. Oh yea, and we don't have free health care, so that's DEFINITELY going on the credit card...

America's (arguably excessive) focus on individualism has revolutionized rights worldwide. Their addiction to military and firearms is rather ridiculous, but their economy and national GDP is so reliant on it at this point that I can't really blame their government for keeping it the way it is. to reduce the military spending down to sane levels (ie. comparable to the rest of the world) would probably kick their unemployment rate up by 10%.

Also, for a list of what America has done for the world let's start with these:
-Helped free Europe from the Nazi's.
-Prevented the world from being communist today. Chances are very good that the USSR would be ruling the world right now, and even worse if it crumbled under it's size then the world would be complete anarchy.
-directly prevented the starvation of the people of west berlin during the berlin air lift
-helped free the people of Afganistan (and actually did a fair job, unlike their clusterfuck in Iraq)
-invented millions of technologies that are enjoyed the world over.
-strives for self-improvement as shown by their election of a black president and laxer laws against marijuana.
-gave us Stephen Colbert.

In conclusion, yes America has flaws, and as a Vancouverite I see them more than most people worldwide, but they also have some redeeming qualities.

* People in my opinion speak and eat like teenagers compared to Europe. The tone is much more familiar and less formal, in American culture you get called by your first name by almost anyone. In Europe, only your friends/relatives would do that, not the bank teller. 

* Comfort food seems to be really popular. The food oriented magazines I see in newsstand mostly talk about burgers, fries, sausage and ribs. They usually feature a close up on a very stuffed pizza or macaroni and cheese that would make most of my friends back home wince in disgust. Quantity seems more important than quality.

* In American culture, brand names are important. While in Europe people would argue what kind of pasta would go with pesto for example, Americans tend to refer to food as packaged products found in the supermarket. I'm always confused by all those chocolate bars name, processed cheese/bread brands that appear of /r/food.

* Technology that is not in private hand (public facilities) is outdated.

* The lack of public service is disheartening. Especially public transportation.

* There is less regulations on many things as well. Asbestos is still around in certain buildings, for example.

* On the other hand, since things are less formal and more flexible, a lot of things are easier to do than where I'm from.

I love to explore and when people come to NY, I like to take them to the places they never would have thought they would see. Tourist attractions are fun, but there's nothing like getting down and dirty with the actual culture of a place. Traveling/Exploring is one of my passions. 

I have always wanted to visit Australia, it just seems like a great place. I lived in England for 7 months and Traveled Europe for 3 weeks. It was an amazing experience.

More personally: I spent one year living back with my parents, mostly in bed, because of a chronic condition that was undiagnosed for years (Lyme Disease). Since then, my entire outlook on life has changed. I now try to be as positive as possible and take each day as a new opportunity to experience all life has to offer.

While I was sick I got really into crafting, to feed my creative side while out of work, and I began selling things online. Jewelry, Pinback Badges, Photo Frames, etc. It's so much fun to use the handmade side of my creative mind. Maybe I can send you some stuff.

There's probably much more to say but I will end here. I love receiving packages!

I'm enamored with our history, and for better or for worse it is my culture and my home.  I am *damn* proud of our 1st Amendment, and my ability to read, write, and say any stupid or offensive though that comes to my mind.

I think developmentally we are in a very difficult stage in our history.  We're dropping off the crest of a prolonged period of privilege and prosperity...  And it seems to me that latter generations have become comfortable and complacent.  A little fat, a little lazy, a little bit dumber.  Mostly because we haven't had a real strong kick in the ass since WWII, though in years to come I think we will recognize this recession as a turning point for today's youth.

In terms of government and society, I think we are stuck in molasses.  We have way too large of a population to be as apathetic as we are.  We're so diverse and set in our respective ways that it seems as though nothing overwhelmingly positive ever gets accomplished... But we sure as hell spend a lot of money.

I have a daydream whereby the U.S.A. breaks up into 50 sovereign countries (or a smaller number of culturally homogeneous blocs) in sort of a European Union type of federation.  A lot of bad could come out of that too... but at least I wouldn't have to put up with dumb shit out of Texas or Arizona (Still love you, TX &amp; AZ).

I am from northern Europe from one of those semi-socialistic countries most Americans can't figure out if to love or hate. Growing up I always heard how great the US was in between listening to American music and watching tonnes of US movies, sitcoms and soaps ergo I've always felt that I could relate to you guys and your culture. Back when the US was our guardian against the big, red Soviet Union a vast majority of western Europeans adored the Yanks. I think we kinda understood that the bad things you occasionally did around the world fell into the category ""It's a shit job but someone has to do it"" so we were generally fine with it. The Americans were the good guys and everything was just swell.

Then the Soviet Union collapsed and everybody ran around confused looking for a new world order which to this day still isn't settled. Europe grew back together (although we still see the eastern Europeans as a bit off but it's getting better) and we felt as if a huge burden had been lifted from our shoulders. The European Union grew stronger and as a natural result the need for big brother across the pond faded. That is basically where we are now although we still feel strongly about our cultural and historical bonds. Most of us want the best for you guys and that's also why during the last decade more and more people have begun to shake their heads and think ""What the hell is going on over there?"" 

I think things really took off when Gore ""lost"" the election to Bush on some very dubious actions. Remember that many European countries have electoral systems very different from that of the US, under those systems Gore would never have lost. It was mindboggling. Here are some of the things I dislike about America as of 2010. Some are perceived and some only refer to certain partitions.

- The lobbying system
- The influence of religion in society and government
- The out-of-control corporate-consumer system
- The general lack of empathy towards the poorest
- The amount of guns and how easy it is to access them
- The lack of interest in the World outside of the US (getting better)
- The hardass police and their methods 
- The fact that you could elect a bafoon like Bush and then re-elect him
- The blatant disregard for the threats of global warming (improving)
- The fact that so many Americans have 2 or 3 two-ton cars.
- The fact that the US jumped on Iraq and Afghanistan on questionable grounds and without clear goals resulting in the chaos we've seen the last 5 years.
- The fact that so many Americans rant about Obama because he is a democrat and black and plenty seem willing to do something about it.
- That so many Americans watch the ""Fair and Balanced"" utter crap that Fox lets out on a daily basis and that a fathead like Glen Beck can muster a 6 digit number of people for his rallies.

I think it bugs many Europeans that you seem to have so many issues these days because we still see you as allies. Unfortunately you've gone from the likable first cousin to the slightly off uncle that the family members always dread inviting over for Christmas.

Medieval and particularly Antiquated Christianity were highly metaphoric.

Modern Fundamentalism is largely a new force and is a classic case of reactionism first against industrialization, then modern ideas like emancipation, women's rights, civil rights, secularism, and gay rights.

The main difference is, it's a big country. It's like a fucking continent (as in the states are as big as countries). If Europe was made in to one country it would probably be quite similar, but i digress. I like US ""goods"" and stuff like that, what drives me out of my fucking mind is the constant banging on the chest proclaiming ""The USA is the greatest country in the world"".

Some of them, yes, are outright stupid assholes, but I think this is EVERYWHERE. I think that the general level of education in discourse is shameful. I like the idea of including everyone's opinion, but seriously, I don't think your opinion matters if Glenn Beck whispered it into your ear or if Jesus sent you a letter about it. 

Americans are also afraid, and they HAVE to be. There is a great climate of fear and mistrust simply because your average person has to deal with so much bullshit to get by. At any moment, your entire world could change because you break your leg. Here in America, if you go skiing on the weekend and break a leg (assuming you can afford to ski) you can easily lose your job, be in debt to the hospital for more than half your annual wages, and see your credit score drop to nothing and your housing taken, and you can end up homeless. Not hard to do at all. As a measure of what our system costs, I dislocated a knee and had to go to the ER. $500 to walk in the door, and then I had to wait in the opulently decorated lobby for 4 hours and fill out a stack of forms because I didn't have insurance. Then the doctor saw me for about 3 minutes, $175, took an X-ray $90, and sent me home with the wrong treatment because he didn't know what he was doing $150. I had to get an MRI $1800, but I had to wait for 2 weeks because I wasn't a priority as an uninsured patient. Then I had to talk with a specialist because of the damages of the original treatment $300, and then one physicl therapy session $350. I couldn't justify going again because it's more than my rent to go sit in a room for 45 minutes. 

This is just an example of why Americans are afraid. The cops are lawless, the rich are lawless (look at our celebrities skipping out of jail for henious drug offenses.), the politicians can do whatever they'd like, and the only way to take them out of office is a lengthy procedure. If you're gay, you can be discriminated against in many states and fired for that reason, if you're LUCKY, you might have a company that offers 2 weeks unpaid vacation, and so on and so forth. It's a place where the quality of your life is directly dependent on how rich you are, so you either are A) born rich, or B) you scramble your whole life to get there. 

What I CAN say is that all the pressure and the fear and the hustle to get to the top makes for an incredibly interesting and diverse set of people. So many strung out junkies and uptight businesspeople, and so much rushing and fighting, and people making new and better things. It's grotesque, and it's addicting. It make life a constant drama, and a constantly changing macabre scene. It's so hard to plan out one's life for that long, because as soon as you get old, there's a new up-and-comer to take your place. Being the best is what people live for, and so there is ruthlessness at every lever of our society. It's dangerous and thrilling. It gives one room to create because everyone's focus is on their own battles. 

It's not right, and it's uncouth, but it certainly fuels a lot of artists and innovators. I think the struggle for something gives a lot of people passion and empathy, and I think that those traits are incredibly important. I wish that no one had to fight. But Americans go to battle in different ways every day. It's stupid and unnecessary, but the America that we know wouldn't be the same without it. People everywhere just want to lead good lives and look after their own, and the US has the potential to be every bit as boring and civilized as anywhere else, but we're not. Anything you want, bad or good, from homeless people dying in the streets to the best universities, is right here. 

And i have to make a note about European racism--get over the fact that people from other countries come to yours. You expect poor Turkish people to stay in Turkey when they can take a TRAIN to somewhere where they can make unimaginable amounts of money? Or a Romanian doctor going to Sweden. You really think someone that smart should stay in their country making a pittance when they are willing to come to yours and work for Swedes for a fair wage? The amount of overt racism, from Swiss minarets to the burquini, to hatred of Poles, or Russians, or Americans is ridiculous. Fuck you. I know that the US is full of racism. People are ALWAYS going to be afraid of people they see as a threat. But goddamnit, look around you at the world. If your friend moved to X place to have a better life for their family, you'd be thrilled, but if someone comes to your country doing the same thing you make fun of their language skills and their customs? Racism exposes elitism and ignorance, and it's sad everywhere. ",,1426449793,0,1,1

Until now, many women never talked about it, because they were understandably traumatized and extremely ashamed - not just of being raped multiple times, but ashamed of what their nation did to Europe and in the concentration camps. They often feel they don't have the right to talk about their suffering when their men caused so much suffering to others. 

Some of the women who have told me these stories kept quiet about it until their husbands died. They didn't want to heap shame upon them. after they came home from the prisoner of war camps. I've read a few books that mentioned these incidences, mostly among the refugees from the Eastern Front, but they were all academic, scholarly record books. Sadly, this is a story still mostly untold. 

And I know you never knew my grandmother, but there really is no reason under the sun that she would lie about this. She lost her father and uncles in WWI, her husband and brothers in WWII, single handedly got her family which included 3 children under the age of 10 and her aged mother across the Oder River into the Western part of Germany so that they wouldn't have to live under the Russians (A walk of hundreds of miles, while being bombed by the RAF and Americas and being chased by the Russians). 

This type of story is some of the tamest stories I've heard from eye-witnesses and people who lived through this. I know of one man who shot every one of his daughters rather than have them raped to death by the Russians, like his neighbours' daughters had.  It was war. It just fucking all-around sucked. 

And I'm so sorry to say, that unfortunately my grandmother did not ""claim"" this. Like many women who went through the same thing, she was so badly damaged by rape that she never re-married - she just couldn't face explaining to a man, what had happened. ",,1426449951,0,2,2

It's the diversity, the ideal of america as liberal above all, which is kind of true in some parts of it, a number of brilliant universities and great science. 

Your pop culture, let's say from the sixties on, has truly shaped the world. It was mostly corporate bullshit, but every now and then your mainstream industry spits out pearls of pure genius. Note that this is partly nostalgia speaking. (And that in part is nostalgia for a time I haven't lived in, but have seen movies, read books, listened to music from that time.)

The Golden Age of California (late 50s, early 60s), the opportunity, the innovation, emergent liberalism, combined with the sunshine seems like some sort of a dreamy, heavenly country that feels unreachable at this point in time. I view it as some kind of personal utopia.

What I dislike about your country is mostly the stuff others are mentioning in this thread - medical system, corporatism and rampant consumerism, workers rights, religion getting louder and louder. And I get the feeling that you work so much that you don't really have time to spend the money you earn on quality *living*, but only on stuff.

So you basically get home exhausted, eat something, have a shower, and what do you have time for? An hour or two for everything else in life? Family, friends, hobbies? How do you manage it? Explain and possibly save me from my prejudice.

All the things I've said here are possibly prejudice and generalisations based on the limited information I get on America, so take it lightly. 

Just impressions.

Not at all. You do realize there is a MASSIVE difference between State and Federal government, I hope? If you go back and read through the entire comment thread you'll note that this entire time I have been arguing against the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT controlling such things, but primarily the argument was about the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT dictating manditory time off and whatnot. To frame things in a more understandable way, the closest analog would be this: Imagine if the EU started dictating to member states manditory paid time off and education instead of letting the member states decide what is best for them individually... does my argument begin to make sense now?

You can't think of the US as equivalent to the UK, or France... the way it's run is more like the EU, and think of the individual states as member states within the EU. What you, and other European redditors has been arguing is that member states should have no right to decide matters such as paid time off and education, they should be the purview of the EU. Do you understand now how one can not have a problem with State government doing things, yet take issue with the Federal government getting into the same business?

&gt;All those people and you were given a fair shot REGARDLESS of what your parents made and yet you tried to argue that it should be a ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" style system. If that were the case the rich would have the best advantage and people like you would be left out thinking ""I should have tried harder"".

Assumptions are fun, aren't they? I've never recieved or asked for any assistance of any kind from the government, not even unemployment. In fact, the only people who have ever helped me out financially, and then only before they kicked me out, were my parents. (edit: in the interest of full disclosure, this isn't entirely true... when I got kicked out I did crash of a friend's couch for a month while I straightend out my life... I paid him back in full and then some as soon as I was employed. Likewise when I moved down here to LA 5 years ago, I borrowed a friend's couch for a month while finding a job/apartment and paid him back within 2 months after) When I talk about pulling myself up by my bootstraps, I mean just that. At 18 I was homeless with only a high-school diploma and a few changes of clothing to my name. At 32 I make $75k/yr as a graphic designer, a career I have been in for nearly a decade now, after a turn in IT. I did not get here with handouts from the state, the feds, or any private organization. To be honest, I refuse to even apply for unemployment (which is taken directly out of each and every paycheck) when I am between jobs. Government handouts of any kind are so distasteful to me; I can't with a clear conscience damn them and then take advantage of them... so I refuse to take advantage of them. I know earlier you assumed I was full of myself, but the truth is: I don't think I am anything special; I am relatively certain anyone can follow the same trajectory very easily if they just apply themselves.",,1426449976,0,1,1

It goes without saying there is no Arabic history that supports her degree of exaggeration, but Arabic histories don't get cited in the English version of wikipedia, or outside of non-academic circles, and as a result, those people in pop-Islamaphobic circles, like Robert Spencer and others, that firmly wish to demonise Muslims have no reason to discount what she writes.

Thank you for the very patronizing history lesson. What part of they have rescinded all claims to the land do you find difficult to understand? 

&gt;All but ONE synagogue was destroyed in the coming 19 years, so their disrespect for other religions doesn't end with cemeteries.

The Jordanians != the Palestinians. Why should the Palestinians be implicated by the actions of the Jordanians? I know us Arabs are all the same to you, but come on...

&gt;Well that's in the last 20 years? The city is a bit older than that. They don't want to claim what was originally their responsibility to begin with? Ok, fine. The UN can control it then. I thought it would be an honor for them, since they are already supposed to be in charge of the Temple Mount area, but have failed to even do that.

It is not their responsibility or that of any other people. It is the responsibility of the Palestinians who have a right to self-determination, free of Israeli, Jordanian or whoever else's interference.  

Speaking of the city's age, it was controlled for what, 19 years of its 3000 year existence by the Jordanians? They have no real claim to the land, or any reason to retake power there. The only reason you and other Zionists keep bringing this point up is because obviously you do not want to see a Palestinian state. Why else would you take such a position? That is not to mention that the Haram El Sharif is under the control of a Palestinian Islamic Waqf, and not the Jordanians. Maybe you should read up on your history too...

&gt;We are talking about vandalism here, so your story is completely unrelated but I don't mind schooling you on that case either.

And it isn't vandalism when you destroy a 1,000 year+ old cemetery? It isn't trying to cover up the historical roots of a people who the Israelis expelled from the country for their own benefit? Gotta love the double standards.

&gt;The cemetery you are linking to is actually in the middle of the city center of West Jerusalem. It's smack dab in the middle of a bunch of sky scrapers.

I don't particularly care where it is. It is a historic site containing the bodies of a number of historical figures - wiping it out is completely in line with Israel's policy of denying Palestinian history and culture. If they were Jewish historical figures in there, do you really think they would just bulldoze it?

&gt;At least the Israelis are willing to hear petitions and file the necessary paperwork before even considering renovations on that site.

How nice of them. They're still tearing it up, so what is your point? 

*""Oh, but we listen to them before destroying their graveyards! So its all OK!""* /s

&gt;I'm talking about Arabs and their lack of regard for Jewish holy sites.

And what about the lack of respect for everything Palestinian, whether it is religion, culture, history or basic human rights?

Did you forget that when the Jordanians took control, 700,000 Palestinians had just been made into refugees? That Israel had been formed on stolen land, and that many like my grandparents were forced to leave their homes for the benefit of European immigrants? That thousands had died across the countries, many of them helpless civilians in places like Dayr Yassin, Al Lydd, Al Tantura, etc.?

But hey, why bother with context, right? Its easier to make it sound like such practices occurred for the fuck of it and without provocation.

No holy site should be disrespected, but its not like these feelings have sprung up out of thin air. You treat someone like shit for long enough and this will be the result.

One of my areas of research is Narratology and Historiography, so I am aware of the problems when it comes to presenting this issue in a credible fashion. In all the research I have done, I have only found one set of records of about 2000 first-hand testimonies regarding these experiences, and they are all sitting in the university library - not online. These are the only records I've personally found, other than the stories I've collected from some women who personally experienced these things. 

It's something I'm working on, but there are multiple issues which make it exceedingly difficult. First there is the reluctance of the victims to relive their terrible experiences. They also have the attitude of ""our nation caused so much suffering that ours is insignificant in comparison"". In fact, very few Germans spoke of their suffering during WWII until recently - the last ten, 15 years or so. The women are also dying off now - earlier and faster than most women their age because of the incredible strains of starvation on their bodies and all the chemicals that were everywhere after the carpet-bombings by the RAF and the Americans. 

Thank you very much for your perspective on this. I find generally that America has an almost completely mythologized concept of what happened in WWII, in regards to their own role - at least in the European theatre, and in comparison to the perspective of the European nations who experienced American involvement. 

In regards to the ""rape vs. consensual sex that later is seen as rape"", from what I have heard from the women I have talked to, that is a good distinction. There was a lot of just out and out rape. There was also a lot of sex which was ""consensual"" in the sense that the girl needed food to keep her family alive, or something to trade in return for food, and therefore ""consented"" out of desperation to survive. There were of course many women who simply had consensual sex with Allied Soldiers. From what I hear, they were not kindly looked upon by other German women. 

It may interest you that of all the women I have talked to, none of them have any hatred towards their rapists - just a sad and tired resignation - as one woman said ""It was war. What do you expect? We had just tried to conquer Europe. We were just beginning to hear of the concentration camps. And we had lost. Lost everything we had fought for. We understood the horrors of war. All war is terrible and terrible things happen in war.""
 They generally didn't take it personally - they were conquered women in conquered territory, and they knew what that entails.

Not really. Most of the people who they would send after the gun owners would turn on the government. There's a reason why our men and women in the military swear an oath to uphold the constitution.

I agree. I think that firearms are potentially very dangerous tools. I feel similarly about cars and sharp objects.

You Europeans tend to have this helpless attitude. It probably didn't even cross your mind that the situation might have ended differently if your friend would have had a gun. 

&gt;Also I'd have to be pretty close to someone for them to stab me. Not so close to be shot.

Seriously though, as many have pointed out, the US is a land of many subcultures, and it's unfair to generalize. Non-Americans are as guilty of generalizing about Americans as we are of their countries.

Major American cities are arguably more heterogeneous than a lot of other major cities around the world. That's where you really see the so-called melting pot. Ideologies dissipate in American cities, which is why they tend to be politically progressive. Towns and rural areas are different. This dynamic - city vs. countryside - is certainly not unique to the US.

The World Cup was a good object lesson in American pluralism. You look at the names on the backs of the shirts of any team, and you basically see one flavor. Spanish shirts had Spanish names on them, Chinese shirts had Chinese names, and so on. The US shirts, on the other hand, had every kind of name imaginable.

There are a lot of religious zealots in the US, but by and large (and compared to almost every country in the world outside of Europe), the US is a secular nation.

Money rules in the US. Consequently, the US believes itself to be a meritocracy, and in many ways that's true. But no where else is a person's identity so directly based on their possessions.

Show me one example in the US where a carrier has implemented or even proposed a tiered model.

What is really in question is differentiated services.  Can I classify protocols of traffic and schedule them differently?  

I just so happen to be a network design engineer who specializes in quality of service and traffic engineering.  This is my bread and butter... I not only manage the network for the company I work for, but I make recommendations for other Fortune 500 companies on a regular basis.

First, you can't have a non-blocking network on a large scale.  Sure, your home can have a guaranteed 100 mbps per port, but as your network expands, you have to deal with oversubscription.  It's typically cheaper and more technically possible to have lower oversubscription ratios the closer to the edge of the network, and higher amounts of oversubscription closer to the core of the network.

Have established that there is always the possibility for contention for bandwidth, it's important to understand that when there is contention, traffic is queued and then dropped.  It's only possible to queue a limited amount of traffic, based upon the memory allocated to the buffers and the amount of latency the engineer is willing to incur along that hop.  After the queue fills, it is tail dropped.

This behavior is indiscriminate, but its effect on traffic is not equal.  A TCP flow will see a drop and it will scale its window size down and effectively reduce its overall bitrate.  TCP will also rerequest the packet which was dropped (and all subsequent packets).  However, UDP will continue to send its traffic without changing its behavior... but that dropped packet will not be rerequested and typically will affect performance of the application (typically voice and video).

So, if I wish to use a UDP application which can not handle large amounts of dropped packets, it is benefical for me to preserve such traffic and drop TCP traffic instead.  It's even better if I can guarantee such traffic as well as guarantee a low latency path for it.  

Furthermore, there is certain traffic which tends to use large amounts of bandwidth, and can safely be throttled back in times of congestion.  FTP, Backup traffic, database replication, and P2P traffic.  If I can drop this traffic first, I can allow it to burst when there's available bandwidth, but treat it as less than best effort.

By using such techniques I can effectively scale my bandwidth in an efficient manner.  Instead of upgrading my core network due to congestion, I can manage such congestion and delay upgrades.  This saves money since such congestion may only appear periodically.

More to come... gotta leave for now.

continued:

Here are some studies to ponder.  

First, a study in Europe showed that at night nearly 95% of the traffic is peer to peer protocols such as bittorrent.  
http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2007/11/nocturnal-p2p-transmissions-account-for-95-percent-of-internet-bandwidth.ars

Second, Arbor networks, who make products which do netflow analysis for large enterprises and service providers did a study of traffic patterns.  

10 percent of subscribers consume 80 percent of bandwidth.
0.5 percent of subscribers consume about 40 percent of total bandwidth
80 percent of subscribers use less than 10 percent of bandwidth

http://gigaom.com/2008/04/22/shocking-new-facts-about-p2p-and-broadband-usage/

There are a few ways in which a service provider can deal with such traffic.  First they can create a less than best effort class of traffic, sometimes known as scavenger traffic.  In times where bandwidth is plentiful, it can consume as much as is available... but when congestion occurs, it is the first traffic to be dropped.  The second option is to rate limit the traffic to a specified bitrate.... that could be a fair amount like 25% or 50% of the link speed, or it could be as low as 8 kbps to discourage the usage of the protocol.  Third option is to drop the traffic entirely.

Now let's analyze this from a service provider's perspective.  You have invested in a backbone network, and you have to connect to other provider's backbone networks to reach their customers.  Some traffic traverses multiple providers and they have to pay transit charges to traverse the intermediate providers' networks.  They can only stay in business by making a majority of their customers satisfied with their service (competition plays a role as well,  we'll get to this later).  If most of their customers aren't heavy peer to peer users, their best interest is to not allow such traffic to interfere with other traffic.  They also aren't interested (and in some cases able) to upgrade their backbone to higher amounts of bandwidth, given much of the traffic is originated by a very small percentage of users.  

Now let's assume they flat out block the traffic.  Those who uses such protocols tend to be your more savvy users, and they are going to find a way around it.  They will tunnel it, or encrypt it, or change the characteristics to make deep packet inspection more difficult.  Same deal for rate limiting it to super low bitrates... people are going to find a way around it.  So your best option really is to either rate limit it to the point where it won't consume more than a reasonable amount of total traffic, or make it the first traffic to drop in times of congestion.  

Also understand that providers are interested in increasing revenue through new offerings.  If they can sell you dedicated bandwidth for video or voice applications, they increase revenue.  This is more likely to be offered in the enterprise market, as we see more companies allow telecommuting... but we're still a ways away from even this.  It's something that I have asked service providers to offer, and they're not interested at this time... it's too much work at this point.

This is much more likely of a model than the nonsense of tiered access.  

Now for the technical problems with net neutrality.  First... it doesn't exist today.  When people suggest that we need to preserve net neutrality, it's coming out of ignorance.  While most providers don't modify most end user traffic, it's not by legal mandate.  Second, telling service providers that they may not block or modify traffic means that they can not block or modify malicious traffic.  Wait for the first DDoS attack and see how usable your Internet connection is.  Also, a service provider that adjusts TTL or a checksum could be in violation of the law, depending on how it is drafted.  Third, expect providers to treat all traffic equally, and start billing you based upon consumption rather than having a flat rate... those like your grandma who just e-mail, will be able to pay $20 a month and never complain.  But if you like streaming netflix, wait and see how wonderful the equal treatment really is.

So now we get to competition.  One of the chief complaints is that people have no choice.  I'll ignore that most people really do have a choice, DSL vs Cable, and in some instances wireless.  Let's assume there is no choice.  That really stems from the franchising of local providers based upon the utility... be it phone, cable tv, natural gas, electric, etc.  There is no competition allowed.  The cost to enter the market is enormous, unless you can deliver your services via wireless.  

Only in the past 6-12 months did wireless become a true viable option with LTE and 802.16.  The problem is that there is no real unlicensed bands that can take advantage of such technologies.  So as a result, there are limited options for wireless broadband other than the incumbent providers.  Here's where I have to give Obama credit... he has called for the opening up of unlicensed spectrum for wireless Internet access.  The devil will be in the details, but it's definitely a move in the right direction.

Greed, conspicuous consumption, optimism, cooperation coupled with suspicion of cooperation, image based politics, a devotion to ""liberty,"" thinking We are great and They suck, etc. These are all very human traits, and it's my opinion that they're applied to America because being human is one of the few things that bind us all together here.

If the corporations acted the way you suggested in the market place they would go out of business! They have to innovate and improve to attract customers.

First of all, I'm not a communist, but it's eye opening the way you sling the word around as if it's profane.

Go out of business? Maybe you don't understand the way business works. The goal is to get a product out the door which consumers will buy at the highest price point while incurring the cheapest cost to the business as possible. So all companies will ultimately remove as much as possible from their product until they meet the minimum required to satisfy the market. This is obvious and I didn't think I would need to state it for you, but I suppose everyone needs a little help. Innovation is *certainly* not the primary way companies attract customers. Innovation is hard because it requires capital up front and the employees with a skill set to solve what is generally a difficult problem (if it was easy, it wouldn't require a new, creative solution). 

What is a *much* easier way to attract customers is attacking the price point of the product at market, and this is what *many* large corporations do. Wal Mart is probably the poster child of this technique. They weren't *innovative*, but they were really, really good at cutting cost. Home Depot is another example. And it turns out customers weigh value very highly when making purchasing decisions

&gt;Let me ask you this: what incentive does the FedGov have to improve? 

The government has stakeholders just like corporations have shareholders. Government stakeholders (voters) don't like big cost overruns, as you can see by all the tea party nonsense going on right now. Although the tea partiers only seem to get upset when it's a Democrat running deficits (even though the deficit, a recession, and 2 wars were inherited from his predecessor). Republicans are immune from such tea party criticism, naturally. 

&gt;How can we have a debate if you don't understand what the real problems are: Governemnt intervention and regulation are the reasons  Health Care is expensive. Medicare is an example of exactly what I'm talking about.

Regulation certainly makes things more expensive, no denying that. But it is *not* the *only* reason why the health care system is so expensive in the US. 

I'm not sure how we can have a debate if you continue to just espouse Republican talking points, and then ignore the independent evidence that contradicts your arguments.

Again, go look at a fact sheet of health care per capita and per GDP. Countries with socialized medicine are more regulated than the US, and their cost is **considerably** less than what the US pays.

&gt;I'm trying to be polite, but why doesn't this make sense to you? When we deregualted the airlines the prices plummeted, airlines kept buying new planes, the quality met demand...how more obvious does it have to be? I've already shown you that European Health Care is heading for financial meltdown and you want to emulate failure?

Funny you use the airlines as a posterchild of deregulation, an industry that is so close to bankruptcy that it's been merging like mad for the last decade while still running huge deficits.

It's interesting -  I think your statement here is exemplary of what a lot of free market zealots think when confronted with people who favor reasonable government intervention in markets (PS - thats what we have in the US). *There's just something they don't get, some magical free market cog that isn't turning in their brain*

I'm sorry to disappoint you, but we just have a fundamental disagreement about the role of government. The fact that you have been thoroughly horsewhipped in the realm of debate doesn't make your side of the coin wrong and my side right - there are failings to both systems.

&gt;I apologize for your personal attacks and uncommon courtesy. I know I have a logical, consistent, fair, compassionate and workable soultion to health care for all

Uncommon courtesy would be exemplary etiquette. I assume you're not a native English speaker, so just a heads up.  

Are you so egotistical to think that, of all the brilliant people in the world who have worked on health care, you (or people like you) are the ones who have the magic bullet that all the intelligentsia *just can't grasp*. As for my irritability, it stems from you posting bullshit sources and completely ignoring my independently sourced (CBO, WHO) rebuttal of your flimsy arguments.

&gt;Your main points are based on fear and hyperbole. Unless you've lived in a country with Universal Health Care you will never know what you're talking about.

That's funny coming from someone whose entire argument is predicated on fear (health care will turn to shit, the government will micromanage your healthcare!) and hyperbole (the government can't do *anything* right). You can complain about implementations of the system all you want, and certainly no one country has it perfect. But the fact remains, I believe that health care is something that should not be managed by for profit companies because they put dollar signs over human beings (as they must to maintain a profit). 

To reiterate: I respect the opinion that the federal government shouldn't have a role in health care. I can understand the overarching reasons. I think you have done a piss poor job enunciating them, but I think it's worth engaging in this kind of mental repartee to understand how other people think.

This guy has it right on principle, but Pat has it right with regard to the real world implications of the influx of Islam in Western civilization. And you really need to make that distinction.
In the real world politicians don't have the guts to stand up against the tyranny of Islam. I see this in my own country, and all across Europe. The simple fact of the matter is that when a certain percentage of the population of a city is Islamic (usually between 5% and 15%) they begin to demand certain special privileges which basically puts them outside the normal state of law (for example setting up Sharia courts). And when these individuals don't get what they demand, they are not shy of threatening the indigenous population or even use violence. And here is when Islam departs from the Western culture.
Now in principle the Bill of Rights would protect us from such a downturn, as many other constitutions throughout European countries are supposed to, but in practice it simply doesn't. Politicians are the same everywhere, they choose the path of least resistance and that leads to dhimmitude. Basically it comes down to this: you cannot tolerate intolerance. What the answer is to this problem, I really don't know. On the one hand we have the principles of a free society which we don't want to tread on, but on the other hand we have a growing Muslim population, many of which are against those same principles.

It is difficult to say anything about the US without resorting to speaking of ""America"" as the US Government or as a symbol for something (globalization, etc). 

So it's best to start with the facts. The United States in the third largest nation in the world by both land mass area and population. It is continually growing as nations like Ireland and Japan struggle with declining (and aging) populations. Rural parts of the US have been increasingly abandoned in favor of large urban centers for the last 40 years or so. Despite the uncertain economy (and political commentary on the US's role in the crisis notwithstanding), the US still maintains the largest GDP in the world (unless you count the EU). The US was (and probably still is, depending on who you ask) a major ""superpower"" military and political presence in the world for more than half a century. American culture has penetrated almost every corner of the world and has inexorably influenced the flow of history and left its mark on the world.

Now for the editorial: 

I've traveled around the world and worked with people from very different backgrounds, and I have found that Americans are, in general, relatively more interested in other cultures and more maleable about their values. This varies enormously from subculture to subculture, of course, but it is a direct result of the ""immigrant experience"" in the US. I grew up in a rich suburb with gated communities and such, yet I still had friends of Indian, Jewish, Russian and Filipino backgrounds. And this isn't all that uncommon.

The US is a giant clusterfuck in a lot of ways. You can't take all the world's populations and stuff them into crowded urban spaces and expect them to get along. Every historical, racial and ethnic conflict in the world is being relived somewhere in the US. All the political talk about ""Unity"" and ""We stand together!"" belies the fact that we're just an enormously diverse group of people. ""Mainstream"" American culture -- fast food, TV, movies, football, etc. -- serves a very important purpose of giving people a collective experience so they can relate to one another. In some ways, this is effective at maintaining social order and allowing us to exist in harmony, and in some ways it fails by being too homogenizing and dull and boring.

It's a weird place. ""America"" is the symbolic expression of the ""mainstream"" culture that we've cooked up to tell ourselves who we are with commercial media and empty gestures of patriotism. We're very lonely and anxious.",,1426450193,0,1,1

Secondly, I've always sort of disliked that whole ""America is a continent"" thing, especially because a lot of people who make it are insufferably pretentious. America isn't a continent. North America and South America are. Language tends towards brevity. It's not quite at the level of ""Germany is not a country. The Federal Republic of Germany is,"" but there is no real ambiguity about what America is referring to, and referring to it as such doesn't confuse people into thinking it's a continent.

As for your general stance, I'd have to agree.

The whole World Series thing is pretty much a strawman. Back in 1903, when it was made, America and Canada were practically the only countries who did play baseball, Cuba notwithstanding. The reason its name goes unchanged? Tradition, I'd suspect. Baseball is pretty much the only American sport to do this anyway, so it's not really indicative of anything. Also, people criticize America for not getting into futbol like the rest of the world, and I hate it.

I hear a lot more people say ""Asian"" when describing people than ""European"", personally.

However, if I saw someone from somewhere in Europe, I would think of their race just as 'white'.

I'm not sure that referring to a trip to Germany as ""holidaying in Europe"" is necessarily denying people individuality, but it's certainly a bit vague and imprecise.

As a 30-year veteran of the Great American Road Trip, you are 100% correct. Consider- you can drive from the UK to France in the same time I can drive from NYC to Atlantic City, NJ. 

Speaking as an American, I can tell you in one word why I haven't left my continent yet (except for Hawaii)- airfare. The cost of flying to Europe is greater than the cost of backpacking through it. 

I'd love to see the Old World (I'd love to see the whole world, actually) but here in the USA I can just drive off to any climate I could want without getting on a plane. I can visit some of the largest cities in the world, and find everything from legal prostitution to hardcore Christian zealots in between. I can surf the beaches of Florida, swim in the Great Lakes, or view the Grand Canyon. I have two mountain ranges to choose from, more farmland than any other nation in the civilized world, and cities filled with people of every race, color and creed under the sun. 

Also: the history of our country goes back far further than the Europeans. There are Iroquois dirt mounds, surviving Pueblos and stone carvings in the South West dating back 10,000 years- and if that's not old enough, head up to Utah for some dinosaur fossils that are 65 million years old. The amount of history, and raw natural beauty, in the USA is simply astounding. 

As a matter of fact- given the scale, space and populations involved, I am simply amazed we lasted this long with only one major civil war. This is probably because all Americans, no matter where they come from, share a critical trait in common- we are all members of a family that was willing, at some time in the relatively recent past, to leave everything we knew behind and venture off for the chance at a better future. 

Land of the brave, indeed.

One need not to look far away that crime and murder rates are much lower in other Western countries (especially scandinavia and western europe) that in the end there will be a lot less tragedies if you have a working prison system.

I've lived in the United States my whole life, and have traveled all across the country, from Cali to Florida, Texas to Ohio and everywhere in between.  I've visited a few other countries, talked to many people who grew up in Europe, Russia etc. and have read much about their social systems and other laws that govern them.  Here's my take on my country.

THE GOOD

-Guns.  I think people in Europe are very strange to not want to own guns.  Whether you ban them or not, criminals aren't going to care, because criminals don't abide by the laws.  I'd much rather have equal or superior firepower to someone trying to break into my home, and it blows my mind the some people across the Atlantic feel otherwise.  I've never heard gunfire in the U.S. except at the shooting range, but I know over 20 people that own firearms.  Maybe you guys trust your government more than we do too, but I think it's ingrained in the collective mind of Americans that revolt against the government is a very real thing that has it's place.  Many people here hunt too.  I also like that I can carry a locking folding pocket knife with a 4 inch blade with me everywhere I go.  I use it everyday for cutting up boxes, quartering and peeling apples and other mundane chores, but in the U.K. as I understand it I'd be limited to a non-locking knife with a blade under 3 inches, which is silly.  I've never threatened or harmed anyone with my guns or knives, and would strongly prefer not to.  But I think it's important to own them, just in case.

-Our geography is incredibly diverse for a single country.  You can experience nearly any climate you would want without leaving our country, from the arid deserts of Arizona to the beautiful, rugged mountain country of West Virginia, to the austere, uninhabited parts of Utah and Colorado, along with states like Ohio that have diverse weather throughout the whole year.

-Speaking of States, it's nice that you can choose from so many different climates to live in, but it's also great that the States have such a variety of laws.  This has it's downsides too but the upside is you can move to a state with no income tax, a state where you can legally smoke weed, a state that doesn't require you to put a license plate on both the front and rear of your car, a state that allows open carry of firearms or whatever other law is dear to your heart.  You can live in one of the most densely populated cities in the world, or you can find towns with populations under a couple thousand.

-The People.  Just like anywhere else there are rich assholes, loudmouthed ignorants, airhead girls and everything else, but there are more genuinely friendly people than not based on my travels.  I've encountered some incredible hospitality in a variety of states, and met very many interesting people along the way.  We aren't a people that you can describe with generalizations (Not that I feel any other country is).

-Privacy.  In recent years our rights have been eroded more than I would like, but there is still a strong sense of a right to privacy for the most part.  It seems to be on the decline however, with cameras popping up so fast we're starting to look like the UK in that respect.

-Progress.  We've come a long way for the better from our roots of owning slaves, not letting women vote and so forth.  On other issues, like adhering to our Constitution and our monetary policy, we've done some serious regression.

THE BAD

-The way we use our military, and how much we spend on it.  I'd love to join the forces as I feel I'd be a great soldier, but as I've told Marine recruiters in the past I don't have enough faith in our administration to make that kind of choice.

-Politics.  So corrupt.  It's so hard to find an honest politician, one who represents the people of the United States and not his own savings account.

-The entertainment industry.  I haven't watched TV or listened to radio in a decade and it's one of the best decisions I've ever made.  Sadly, TV is just what you do in this country when you get off work for most people.  It's sad going for a walk through my neighborhood and seeing TV's on in every home.

-Our food.  Fast food and our highly processed, artificial foods in particular.  It can be difficult not to find something without an artificial sweetener linked to cancer and neurological disease, or high fructose corn syrup, or artificial colors and so forth.  Our low quality food is one of the most frustrating aspects of our country, but at least we have better options available.

-Our tax system.  I do not mind paying taxes in general, but I would like to have some say as to where my taxes go towards.  I do not feel like giving 30-40% of my earned income away to the government is getting me what it should.

-For a ""free"" country, there are many things you can't do in certain parts of the country I feel you should be able to.  Smoke weed, drink when you're 18 (You can own guns and join the service, but can't buy a beer?), marry someone of the same sex (I think it's weird and gross, but people should be able to do it if they want), carry a large, locking pocket knife (Some areas like NYC have absurd knife laws), etc.

-Our healthcare system seems to be a joke compared to a lot of European countries.

-The whole illegal immigration issue.  Our country needs to secure it's borders and enforce our immigration laws, not sue states that attempt to do so.  I, and every other American I know, highly values immigrants from any part of the world coming here *legally,* but those who come here illegally and use taxpayer money to use services they don't pay into, we find that highly disrespectful, and we find it very disrespectful with foreigners try to paint us as ignorant racists for preferring immigrants entering our country to follow our immigration laws and attempt to learn the predominate language.

-Americans that try to paint this as a Christian Nation.  Many founding fathers were, and many Americans currently are some type of Christian denomination faith, but this is a Nation of religious freedom and *usually* religious tolerance.  Lately some of us haven't gotten along so well with people of the Islamic faith, but there are certain people of that faith who haven't been giving us a very good impression to be fair.

-Our Federal Reserve.  Too many Americans remain uninformed of our true monetary policy (Thinking ""The government"" prints and controls the money supply, not the Fed) and the great evils it perpetuates.

But what we're talking about here is health care. A product. A service. A necessity by some, but then again a hundred years ago we'd all be considered living better than kings right now, so necessity is a relative term. The question isn't really about health care, now is it? No, it's about what we consider ""fair"" or ""what we expect"". That's what ths really is. Now-a-days we 'expect"" to get stuff from the government. After all in Europe they have it *much better* than in the US. In a way they're *ahead of us* on social issues. When an American sees how Europe has solved what the people are asking for, they describe it in terms of ""compassion"", and basic human ""rights"". The citizens have been sequestered in their post WWII borders and, prior to the EU, have been forced to look inward and rebuild thier war-torn countries in favor of a ""better"" society. Thanks in large part to the US, the military budgets of these countries has been a token amount of their GDP and they've had the ability focus on their own internal affairs. And compared to compared to the US, some countries are even as small as US States in size and population. This is another important point: The countries in Europe have been far more socialized and heavily taxed that their American counterparts for far longer. A thing many American's look back at and say ""I like it, sign me up!"" The problem gets awkward however, when it's noted that America's population has been *flooded* with European immigrants *even to this day*. So you wonder *why* these immigrants are leaving thier ""utopian"" society for the barbaric US? Well I can tell you why because my mother and father emigrated from Europe and wanted a better life in the US. And what people like you are doing is not understanding what that *really* means. It's about *freedom* and *opportunity* and *liberty*. Ultimately it's about liberty, really. You know, when it was so bad in their home countries, the people of Europe fled to better opportunities. Maybe what you should do is pack your bags and say goodbye to your homeland (just like my parents) and start a new course in a foreign land. I'm sure you'll find an elnclave of Americans to commiserate with. My problem is when honest well-intended American's, like yourself, want something that's not in the game plan of the Constitution. For every governme program that finds it's way into your wallet, your habits, your choices, is another crack in the Liberty bell --itself a fitting token to the Liberties that used to ring true are now the sound of hollow dead-metal. So you see, it's not about Health Care. American's are the most generous people on earth and we used to have doctors make house visits. We had charity hospitals. I'll tell you what, I'd much rather have nonprofits like Habitiat for Humanity, the Goodwill, and The Humane society run a local charity hospital than a faceless Washington Bureaucrat any day.

However, for the significantly shorter (on average) population of African pygmies (average height just below 5'), someone who hit 6' 6"" would undoubtedly have back and knee problems, to say the least.

That said, I'm sure there has to be an upper limit of some sort; I would imagine that taller adults were probably bigger babies and childbirth is fairly painful as is (humans have effectively the single most painful childbirth in the mammalian kingdom--if not among all animals--because the female pelvis has not kept up in size with the human brain), so that might well end up being a limiting factor.

Certainly, the logistics of movement and locomotion would change significantly if we grew to be twenty feet tall, but that wouldn't happen overnight, so adaptation along the way might work it out.

**TL;DR** Extreme growth caused by a medical condition and simply being tall because of one's genes are two different situations.

First and foremost, I am a patriot and a White Nationalist. Both of these are synonymous with fervent love for America -- Constitution, Founding Fathers' genius, Stars and Stripes, endless opportunity to prosper and maximize wealth &amp; happiness, except for some things:

* US government and monetary policy are controlled by Jews and ruling Establishment (wealthy industrialist-plutocratic-oligarch globalists) since the passage of Federal Reserve Act in 1913 and ratification of the 16th Amendment. 17th Amendment allows direct election of senators, which made it easier for senatorial candidates to get elected for continuous terms, and not be held accountable for their crimes and misdemeanors due to the stupidity of voting citizens who could be easily manipulated (case in point: primary election of Arizona Sen. John ""Amnesty"" McCain). 

* Too many redundant and oppressive taxes after the passage of the Federal Reserve Act and ratification of the 16th Amendment. 

* While FDR and LBJ ""might"" have served America, they are traitors thorough and thorough -- not only to the Constitution and Framers' intent of a perfect Union, but also to alter America's political, financial and ethnic makeup for the worst future with passage of Social Security Act, and Immigration &amp; Nationality Act among other abominations. (and they forced America into destructive wars)

* USA's Constitution after the 11th is an unmitigated mess. Every Amendment after the 11th should be repealed, except that the amendment which restrict presidential terms to two (8 years total) should be retained. Thank goodness Communists and Feminists' wet dream [Equal Rights Amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Rights_Amendment) failed to pass in early 80's.

* USA is royally screwed with the rapid outsourcing of manufacture and labor, which leads to the depletion of the middle class as the equalizing political power and economic engine. When the US's middle class is minimized to lesser influence, governmental tyranny rises.

* USA is number one nation with more obese people. USA has not restricted nor regulated many dangerous type of fattening and unhealthy food, such as MSG, Aspartame, and High Fructose Corn Syrup.

* USA should have [expelled](http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/expelled.htm) most Jews as many nations have done in the past. Zionist Jewry is the source of social and economic ills in America. 

* USA should have sent blacks **back** to Africa, peaceful leave or gun point. President James Monroe supported the idea of repatriating freed black slaves back to the homeland. With Jews' [role](http://www.davidduke.com/general/two-new-david-duke-videos-the-shocking-jewish-role-in-slavery_19270.html) in African slave trade, America is worse off with the astronomical crime (rape, murder, drugs) and welfare leeching that cost and ruin innocent lives, wastes tax money, and create ghettos &amp; depressing neighborhoods and abominable mixed-race offsprings with white race traitors. Yet negroes should be accommodated as though they are our equal in the name of biological egalitarianism courtesy of Jacobin Communist/Cultural Marxist rationale. BS!

* America should not declare war unless the Congress explicitly authorizes it, and I believe in ""Just War"" theory. Civil War, World War I and II, Vietnam War, and Gulf War I and II are avoidable given the circumstance. 9/11 is a Zionist-Elitist [inside job](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVKGRB3cygg), and Neocon thugs &amp; their minions detained &amp; executed and Israel nuked from orbit for the crime. The prolonged and brutal wars only deplete White population needed for production of a superior American civilization as a model of Western Civilization with the original Constitution preserved.

* USA should reduce its dependence on foreign oil and build the nation from within by tapping the vast resources, including expediting the development of feasible and affordable renewable energy technology. No more coddling theocratic and Communist tyrannies like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.

* US citizenry should reduce the bureaucracy of the U.S. government to relegate it to limited role, with states' rights restored while ignoring unjust Supreme Court rulings that bar segregation and anti-miscegenation laws, among other judicial tyrannies that serve to dilute White race cohesion, strength and harmony. 

* USA should withdraw from and expel United Nations and World Trade Organization, and pay off the trade deficit and national debt to return to fiscally conservative government.

* USA should repeal thousands of (that's right, thousands) federal laws passed by compromised and corrupt Congress that prove bureaucratic and hostile to Constitution and liberty.

* USA should, of course, abolish Federal Reserve for century-long corruption and fraud. Each and every state should create a state bank with the board of directors appointed by the elected treasurer in office. The more surplus to redistribute wealth to improve developments, rather than by Federal government's conditional grants, the prosperous the state and municipalities will be. 

As it is now, USA is a grotesque mess, in part caused by corrupt Washington body politic hijacked by Zionists and Wall Street fat cats, and retrogressive federal laws such as 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act that diluted White population in USA from nearly 90% in early 60's to 65% now. 

Founding Fathers intend for USA to be free, and with freedom come security and prosperity, and with prosperity come preservation of original liberty enshrined in the original Constitution. This continuous preservation of freedom and continuous prosperity for another century is possible only with intact and guarded White race &amp; cohesive strength as the major contribution to America's ingenuity.

Thing is, they're not.

If you're convicted, are under 18 or are mentally unfit you don't have the same fundamental rights as everyone else. Children are forced to help in the house, a schizophrenic can be interned against his will if he poses a risk to society and a criminal can be incarcerated.

However, the limits placed on an individual's freedom must be reasonable and in accordance with a transparent and democratic system of law.That's the problem: democratic and reasonable don't always mix. Primarily because what's good for most people isn't always good for the minority.

So, in the US prison is used as punishment. It is popular. Prisons win elections.

Outside the US, in some EU countries, prisoners are treated well and let out early when they no longer pose a risk. Punishment is less important. It is never popular with the man on the street.

EG: The Netherlands is lax. The Netherlands has an extreme right party which scored very well, due to its hard stance on crime.

In the United States, we use the desire of the antisocial to become social to our advantage. It drives much of our entrepreneurship. It has disadvantages, such as the a discontented class of people that can be driven to crime, though we try to medicate the agitated ones.

This culture of self discovery, instead of institutional ""social education"", is great because it has driven medical, energy, food, and communication technology. All of these, while motivated by the angst of isolation and the love of intellectual escapism, deliver benefits to everyone.

My comment was more about the societies with less reputable social norms. There are some still that have ruling classes that suppress the social learning of the lower classes, and even kill those who try to educate them.

Other places have a history of abuse and destroy any social people, but make little impact on the world because they cannot organize any safe society in which industry can flourish.

Where do you think the stereotypes about Jews being ""greedy"" came from? You ever think about connecting those two dots? 

Yes, it largely comes from the fact that Jews were the primary moneylenders for much of European history since Christians were not allowed to lend to other Christians.  Thus Jews were the only people who lent money to Christian Europeans (the majority of Europeans), they charged interest on this lending, and it lead to resentment because generally people don't like owing money to other people.  Where do *you* think it came from?  I certainly don't see how choosing Barbarus instead of Jesus creates an image of ""The Greedy Jew.""

&gt;The ""racial science"" you are talking about, was actually ""religious science"", it was bogus science in order to explain away religious antisemitism.

Do your have a source for this?  Because most Nazi officials and scientists cited Darwin as evidence that Jews were inferior, not the Bible.  Granted, they were wrong, I'm not making that silly argument that ""Darwin caused the Holocaust!,"" because obviously the idea that natural selection justifies eugenics, or racial science, or the Holocaust is idiocy.  But that's how the Nazis justified these ideas based on every source I've ever read.  Again, if you have a factual source that indicates otherwise, I'd be interested to see it.

&gt;You are absolutely wrong that the argument wasn't used, and that still doesn't change that the PEOPLE AND THE RELIGION held these views, and thus ENABLED such actions. Get it?

And as I said, most Nazis were big fans of Darwin and natural selection too.  By this logic natural selection enabled the Holocaust, which is obviously retarded and so is the idea that Christianity aided the Holocaust.  Again, if you can show me that there was a significant religious factor behind Nazi anti-semitism I'd be interested to see it.",,1426450420,0,4,4

I never said that killing Hitler would resurrect the dead or ""undo any of his damage,"" thus this statement is a strawman. What I would say is that, firstly, killing Hitler or other fascists prevents them from continuing their genocidal killing spree. It also provides some degree of justice and closure for their victims, and sends a message to other would-be Hitlers that if they conduct genocides, they themselves *will* be killed, thus acting as a deterrent.

In terms of deterrence, consider: who does the schoolyard bully prey upon, the child who is meek and defenceless or the child who will fight back? 9 times out of 10, the bully will prey upon the former. States, corporations and armies are much the same: they are more likely to go to war with a people who are unable or unwilling to defend themselves, than to go to war with a people who will fight back and destroy them. The ability and willingness to defend oneself is the most effective form of deterrence.

&gt; I am an atheist.

But your arguments are Christian. Centuries ago churches sought to deflect criticism from the oppressive sociopolitical institutions that they propped up, so they propagated the idea that it is not serfdom which is a sin, but the rational feeling of hatred and jealousy in response to serfdom which is a sin. In this way, they ingeniously transferred the blame from the oppressor (feudal lord) onto the oppressed (serfs) and in so doing created a culture of self-loathing among the oppressed, which stifled resistance. In this vein, you are condemning executing genocidal fascists as ""an act of revenge,"" as if revenge is inherently a bad thing... It isn't. Revenge of this sort, on top of the tangible benefits I listed in my previous paragraph, can be a very satisfying thing, contrary to what Christian dogma would have us believe.

&gt; Both strawman fallacy and Hitler argument in one sentence, wow.

First of all, we are in a discussion about Nazi collaborators in World War 2; to accuse me of Godwin's law in such a case is totally absurd and, if anything, betrays the weakness of your arguments and the degree to which you are grasping at straws...

I am by no means saying that the US is or has been unilaterally correct in all the decisions that we have made, nor were we the deciding factor in every conflict we've engaged in, but even as a bleeding heart liberal I think it's insanely inappropriate to deny the influence that the US had on WWII.

Apparently you haven't read much Foucault? 

&gt;I hope historians of philosophy will forgive me for saying this, but I believe that Bentham is more important for our society than Kant or Hegel. All our societies should pay homage to him. It was he who programmed, defined, and described in the most exact manner the forms of power in which we live, and who presented a marvelous and celebrated little model of this society of generalized orthopedics- the famous Panopticon, a form of architecture that makes possible a mind-over-mind type of power; a sort of institution that serves equally well, it would seem, for schools, hospitals, prisons, reformatories, poorhouses, and factories. ...
&gt;For Bentham, this marvelous little architectonic ruse could be used by a variety of different sorts of instituions. The Panopticon is the utopia of a society and a type of power that is basically the society we are familiar with at present, a utopia that was actually realized. This type of power can properly be given the name panopticism. We live in a society where Panopticism reigns.

&gt;Panopticism is a form of power that rests not on the inquiry but on something completely different, which I will call the ""examination."" The inquiry was a procedure by which, in judicial practice, people tried to find out what had happened. It was a matter of reactualizing a past event through testimony presented by persons who, for one reason or another, because of their general knowledge, or because they were present at the event, were considered apt to know.

&gt;With panopticism, something altogether different would come into being; there would no longer be inquiry, but supervision and examination. It was no longer a matter of reconstituting an event, but something-or, rather, someone- who needed total, uninterrupted supervision. A constant supervision of individuals by someone who exercised power over them-schoolteacher, foreman, physician, psychiatrist, prison warden- and who, so long as he exercised power, had the possibility of both supervising and constituting a knowledge concerning those he supervised. A knowledge that now was no longer about determining whether or not something had occurred; rather, it was about whether an individual was behaving as he should, in accordance with the rule or not, and whether he was progressing or not. The new knowledge was no longer organized around the questions: ""Was this done? Who did it?"" It was organized in terms of presence and absence, of existence and nonexistence; it was organized around the norm, in terms of what was normal or not, correct or not, in terms of what one must do or not do.

And, later, in the same lecture series:

&gt;Panopticism is one of the characteristic traits of our society. It's a type of power that is applied to individuals in the form of continuous individual supervision, in the form of control, punishment, and compensation, and in the form of correction, that is, the molding and transformation of individuals in terms of certain norms. The threefold aspect of panopticism- supervision, control, correction- seems to be a fundamental and characteristic dimension of the power relations that exist in our society.

&gt;In a society like feudal society, one doesn't find anything similar to panopticism. That doesn't mean that in a society of a feudal type or in the European societies of the seventeenth century, there weren't any agencies of social control, punishment, and compensation. Yet the way these were distributed was completely different from the way they came to be established at the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth. Today we live in a society programmed basically by Bentham, a panoptic society, a society where panopticism reigns.

And I'm no grammarian or etymologist by any stretch, but I believe most of those words you listed have been with English since its proto-forms and/or when there was a massive influx of Latin in our language. ""Children"" is a lot like ""Kinder(n)"" not because we stole the word from German and kept their (rough) pluralization, but because English has Germanic roots and it's just always been that way. The Latin words you listed may seem like we simply stole them too, but I know that those words are extremely similar, if not identical, in most all European languages because of the Imperialist Romans taking over much of Europe before it became a collection of various countries, and so the Romans' language got intermingled with the Germanic/early English and Romantic was born as well. Again, these words kind of got mixed in with the roots of modern English, and they just stayed with us for so long we kept their original pluralizations. 

The word octopus, however, wasn't invented until 1758, well after English had taken on its own methods of pluralization and became scattered around the globe -- that's relevant because no longer do European influences affect all of the English language. So it'd make sense why it'd be octopuses rather than octopodes imo, but even assuming everything I've said is dead wrong (I don't deny the plausibility), I'm betting that you say platypuses, and given that word has the same Greek suffix ""-pus"", the same rule should apply when referring to octopuses.

While I can't speak for Europe, here in Australia generally the criminals that can obtain guns are the big ones, organised crime, bikie gangs etc. The sort of people who break into houses, hold up corner stores and so on aren't all that likely to be able to get hold of a gun because they are a rarity. We aren't all that likely to get shot by a drugged up loser who wants to steal $50.

Its not like people here can't get a gun if they need to hunt, for sport or a genuine reason so I don't see why there's a big deal about the [laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_Australia).

This is obviously another big problem we have here in Australia... the way I see it is we're only looked down upon for taking the country because it was so recent. Most European (and even some Asian) countries have been invaded so many times you can hardly tell who the original people were. As for the treatment of the native inhabitants we are probably not as bad as in the past but probably not so different. When the Romans invaded England they murdered heaps of people then set up infrastructure which the English ""barbarians"" didn't understand at the time (there has been evidence of Roman era houses with central heating which didn't re-emerge in England for some time after the Romans left).

I would personally go for the Ford Fiesta hatch. I think it's a great looking car (although criticized for its style over practicality) and has top-class fuel economy (30/40). It also earned the [Top Safety Pick](http://www.iihs.org/news/default.html#082510) from the IIHS. However the base price for the hatch is a couple grand higher than the Versa and a few hundred over the Fit. 

I'm also all for supporting Ford; they're making quality cars now and survived where other American car companies failed. Since the Fiesta has been out in Europe a couple years we can see it's been [reliable](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/news/5894686/Honda-tops-reliability-survey.html) although not as much as the Fit (Jazz).

All-in-all though, I think the safe choice is the Honda Fit. Seems to be a fun car to drive with great use of space and will be reliable. I would not recommend the Yaris at all (my brother has one) and having driven the Versa as well I can't say I like it.

In my opinion, so long as I get better, I don't really care about how 'high' the standards are. I've used the NHS and found the doctors and nurses to be very knowledgeable and friendly, and the whole experience was very comfortable. Granted, I wasn't seriously ill, but everybody was supportive, reassuring and they had everything they needed to fix me up. I don't really see how it could have been better, besides perhaps less of a wait (waited 1 and a half hours in the waiting room).

When I say ""higher standard"", I suppose I really meant that you don't have to wait so long to get treatment. I suppose the thread count on the bedsheets might be higher too. But I'm of the opinion that the important thing is that you recover from what's ailing you. The fact that only a portion of the US population even *receive* healthcare makes it a pretty shitty standard in my mind, no matter how shiny the actual facilities may be.

However, your money usually will go a lot farther in America compared to most European countries. Housing is much cheaper in the US (as long as you don't live in or around an expensive city, but that's generally true universally).

&gt; New Zealand was the first country in the world to grant all citizens the right to vote, in 1893, but women did not get the right to run for the New Zealand legislature until 1919.

[...]

&gt; The first European country to introduce women's suffrage was the Grand Duchy of Finland. The administrative reforms following the 1905 uprising granted Finnish women the right both to vote (universal and equal suffrage) and to stand for election in 1906.

How about we compare apples to apples: Do you think the same would hold true if you asked Americans to place China on a world map? What about Japan? Australia? 

Even not considering the geopolitical impact, Eastern Europe is a cluster-fuck of tiny countries. There's *three* countries in North America. You have a 30% chance of getting it right if you have even a concept of region.

&gt; Germany has states too and I know most of them by name also. Oddly enough they don't always make such a fuss about being from Schleswig-Holstein or Bayern. Maybe to other Germans but not to foreigners.

The entire country of Germany is smaller than some states. Of course no one can name the states in Germany other than Germans! Geographically speaking the difference in being from Seattle and New York is like being from Munich and Baghdad. It's laughable that this is even a comparison.

Even with smaller geographic diversity though, you're just wrong. There is a big difference in being from Berlin as opposed to Bavaria. There's a big difference if you come from Easter Germany and if you come from the West.

It was primarily maintained by network effects and [anticompetitive business practices](http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20090421111327711) ([original source](http://www.ecis.eu/documents/Finalversion_Consumerchoicepaper.pdf) - PDF warning) - as the link clearly shows, Microsoft was quite happy to (and capable of) intentionally breaking interoperability *even with perfectly compatible* third party systems.  Copyright and patents had nothing to do with it.

In fact, when software patents were first mooted [Microsoft argued vehemently against them](http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2007/03/analysis-microsofts-software-patent-flip-flop.ars), but in the mid-90s they gave in and started assembling their own patent portfolio for defensive purposes.

Regarding copyright law, Microsoft also has a private position of [*actually supporting it* where consumers would otherwise use competitors' or open-source products](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20070312/165448.shtml)... again, because benefits from network effects still make piracy preferable to losing a user to a competitor.  Microsoft don't really give a shit about copyright law - they'd rather you used a pirated version than not, they're quite happy to break compatible competitors' products, and they only use copyright to squeeze *extra* money out of corporate customers and serial pirates.

Hence - if you actually know your computing history - Microsoft's substantial desktop OS monopoly did not require anything much in the way of copyright law *or* patents.  Rather, it was achieved almost entirely through a combination of IBM's miscalculation and Microsoft's own efforts (often, and this can't be stressed enough, in *violation* of applicable antitrust laws) - network effects, intentional, enforced incompatibility and sharp business practices.

TL;DR: Although it's heresy to big-L-Libertatrians, IBM and Microsoft's own actions ruined the ""free"" computer OS market, without any government intervention necessary.  All governments did was to attempt - largely ineffectually - to restrain their worst excesses.",,1426450776,0,2,2

biologically speaking there is one race. thats it. so when you start off by talking about this ""race"" and that ""race"" youre already showing what an ignorant ass you are about the subject. i find it kinda offensive myself.

you like welfare, you like your police and your roads and your kids being educated for free so w/e. your state likes that free money too from the fed gov. ill bet you send/sent your kids to public school and hey payed taxes too, but i highly doubt what you put into the system equates to enough money a year to educate them yourself.


the ""race"" card is a weapon thats been used by racists to segregate themselves from the conquered or enslaved peoples. people in the european colonies like us yanks. 

get with the times caveman, we dont use ""race"" we use the word ethnicity because we understand the shit that comes with ""race"". japan has over 50 ""races"" and brazil over 200. funny thing about brazil is that your can have 2 kids from the same parents and if one is darker than the other that kid is considered a different ""race"". so when you talk about ""race"" while describing humans you sound like a dumbfuck. the **only** correct use of the word biologically is when you talk about hominids.

see your last paragraph? see how you hate generalizations? thats what ""race"" is, a generalization about people and where they come from.

think of it like this, you shouldnt be held accountable for past racists ideals and actions. by eliminating ""race"" from your dialect you relieve yourself from that. does that make sense? you're part of the solution not the problem that perpetuates the myth.

i cant change a lifetime of learning in one post, i think the outrage you feel is because you're not a ""racists"" in any other form than using bad science. you still use racist language etc. im not blaming you, hell the 2000 census asks you to identify your ""race"" but the gap is being bridged by the term ""ethnicity"" in 2010.

I'm not really an expert in that field at all but I believe launch sites try to be closer to the equator so that achieving orbit is easier and requires less trajectory corrections.

It's basically THE arm that every shuttle uses if it will be doing repairs and I think the ISS has two of them for maintenance work.

#1:  won't this lead to a squeeze on housing supply (as houses stop being maintained and fall into disrepair, thus removing them from the market), thereby reducing supply, raising demand, and increasing prices?  I was under the impression that part of the problem was ""too many homeowners"".

#2 Doesn't this depend on what people are saving on?  Yes, everyone cutting spending will cause a slump, but everyone no longer buying useless shit?  People will still buy food, cars, white goods, tools, etc. etc. etc.

#3 I have trouble believing that _every_ bank was exposed to toxic assets.  Furthermore, bailouts didn't seem to get banks lending again, rather leading to consolidation, share buybacks, and cash hoarding.  So maybe a serious round of culling is needed.  Reduced availability of credit I could see as a serious short-term problem, but perhaps, just perhaps, that'll lead to tightened credit requirements in the future, so you don't get abominations like NINJA loans and mortgage-backed securities in the future?

#4 Ugh.  Hi.  Europe here.  Seems to still be doing OK, but my savings account is in Switzerland, and my job in Euroland.  I now earn ~10% less than when I started.  Thing is, Germany's doing ok, as are a lot of the other countries, and Spain and Italy are nowhere near as bad (although still pretty broken) as some of the alarmist predictions, so I can't see this happening.",,1426450884,0,2,2

here you go man this is the current thinking on ""race"" in america, and you know what, this statement was put out 12 years ago.

http://www.aaanet.org/stmts/racepp.htm

**American Anthropology Association "" Statement on 'Race'""**

*"".. From its inception, this modern concept of ""race"" was modeled after an ancient theorem of the Great Chain of Being, which posited natural categories on a hierarchy established by God or nature. Thus ""race"" was a mode of classification linked specifically to peoples in the colonial situation. It subsumed a growing ideology of inequality devised to rationalize European attitudes and treatment of the conquered and enslaved peoples. Proponents of slavery in particular during the 19th century used ""race"" to justify the retention of slavery. The ideology magnified the differences among Europeans, Africans, and Indians, established a rigid hierarchy of socially exclusive categories underscored and bolstered unequal rank and status differences, and provided the rationalization that the inequality was natural or God-given. The different physical traits of African-Americans and Indians became markers or symbols of their status differences.

As they were constructing US society, leaders among European-Americans fabricated the cultural/behavioral characteristics associated with each ""race,"" linking superior traits with Europeans and negative and inferior ones to blacks and Indians. Numerous arbitrary and fictitious beliefs about the different peoples were institutionalized and deeply embedded in American thought...""*

pretty basic shit man. but i know, its a ""straw man"" argument lol.
 
edit:

 **""The concept of race in the United States is associated, historically, with an early European folk taxonomy that linked perceived biological and behavioral differences with a ranking, in terms of superiority, of races. Unfortunately, remnants of that ranking system and negative stereotypes of different ""races"" persist today, despite the fact that ""race"" has no scientific justification in human biology.**

Modern humans (Homo sapiens) are a fairly recent and homogeneous species, and genetic data indicate that there is as much genetic variability between two people from the same ""racial"" group as there are between two people from any two different ""racial"" groups. Because of the biological connotations and misunderstandings associated with the term ""race,"" the American Anthropological Association recommends eliminating ""race"" and replacing the term with a more correct term, such as ""ethnic origins.""

**Eliminating the term ""race"" presents an opportunity and dilemma. It is important to recognize the categories to which individuals have been assigned historically in order to be vigilant about the elimination of discrimination. Yet ultimately, the effective elimination of discrimination will require an end to such categorization, and a transition toward social and cultural categories that will prove more scientifically useful and personally resonant for the public than are categories of ""race."" Redress of the past and transition for the future can be simultaneously effected...""**",,1426450885,0,2,2

But barring kids or some other legal reasons (for example, your new found love is Swedish and you feel like moving to Europe), there is not much reason to marry nowadays.

Finally, if you do get married, you might want to consider a prenuptial agreement.

Spain has for example, ""pelota basca"" some kind of ancient racquetball sport. They don't name their tournament ""world championship"" though.

Extending my point about USA being self-centered. I've worked with a lot of U.S citizens that did not know where my country was. I'm from Argentina, not a small country at all. Not a new country either. So, excuse me if I'm wrong, but that's what I get from my own experience.

The U.S. poverty threshold is greater than the GDP per capita in many other countries, but this doesn’t mean it's better to be poor in America than average somewhere else. Prices for the same goods vary greatly from country to country. To get an idea of where one country’s poor stand in relation to another’s, comparisons would have to be made in purchasing power parity.

I don't know if you want a stat on health care, but it's a simple fact that most Western European countries have no problem getting medical services to the poor, and I hope you would agree the US has a poor record on that. If you disagree I assume you are blinded by patriotism and this discussion can go no further.

As for cherry picking...child mortality, crime/imprisonment, wealth divide, health care and education are cherry picking and random when discussing the quality of life in a nation? Are you mad?

All these studies show the US  below Europe or a portion of Europe. 

This would be a relevant statistic

The difference between me and you is that I'm prepared to admit my country (the UK) is way behind Europe in many respects and it doesn't bother me to do so, whereas you are blinded by patriotism or some such bollocks (I expected nothing less when discussing the States). I can see my country is lower than it should be stats wise, but for some reason all you see is 'cherry picking'.

OK apologies for mistakes/bad formatting/grammar etc. But I was really banging this out!!

1. The housing market has its segmentation.  I suppose the scenario you mentioned may happen on the lower side of the market where even if the property lost 100%, we are talking in the sub 100K prices.  On the higher end, the principal loss (or bank loss) is much higher and the incentive to keep it on te market bigger.  If you average the market, the higher end crash has a much bigger macro-economical impact than the low-end.

2. It is a demand for products and services issue.  Low demand will make companies top-line crash and we will have more unemployed.

3. The banks are in the business of risk-management.  Given the possibility of item 2 above, their behavior is rational.

4. Except Germany which has a manufacturing base and is/was an-export driven economy, not a lot of bright lights (economically-speaking) there.  There is a limit what the Germans will put up with the other EU members (specifically the ones they call ""Club Med"")

Sorry, but if you bothered to read the previous post, you'd see why we aren't disillusioned. I'm 23, and I originally thought I was a Republican as well. Just like was mentioned earlier, self-sufficiency, the ""American Dream"", all that bullshit rhetoric. Guess what. Private Timeshifter, reporting for duty. Thank god that's all done with; I'm a programmer now, doing relatively well for myself compared to where I used to be. Regardless, the fact remains: In the past 30 years at *absolute minimum*, the GOP has made a habit of saying ""We believe in the American Dream"", while conveniently excluding the ""...but only if you're already filthy fucking rich and couldn't possibly use any more money"" part of it. Forget about what the GOP *says*, look at what the GOP *does*: Most of us are intelligent people willing to work for a living, scraping to get by. What part of the ""American Dream"" does that sound like to you? It sure as hell isn't mine.

&gt;I know I appear as some young entitled knucklehead with no real world experience

As mentioned, I'm 23, and yes, you very much do. Many European countries have proven that what we're so goddamn afraid of actually *works*. Go ahead, call me a socialist. I'll agree with you. If you think socialism is evil, you must also think the highway system is evil, Medicare is evil, education is evil, *social* security is evil, and the blessed Armed Forces are evil. Socialism *works*, and it's been proven many times. A truly free market doesn't, and it never will, as long as people remain as they are today: self-serving, greedy, willing to screw others to get what they perceive to be an advantage. Yes, this is a broad generalization. But look who's rich right now. Mostly people who have in some way, shape, or form, screwed someone else over *big time.* If you're in charge of a gas company, you can sleep soundly at night knowing you're screwing over the entire country, if not the entire planet, by absolutely refusing to let any money get put into alternative energy.

Regulate the free market: if a company is too big to fail, it's too big to exist. Socialize basic human needs: if I'm paying into a health care system, *by definition*, you can't deny me from being seen or treated. Get rid of this goddamn genetic engineering for food stocks: we've survived for thousands of years off of what the earth has produced, and in the past 100, we've become a country full of fat, lazy, unhealthy fucks, because ""bad food is cheaper"". No. Good food has been growing for millenia. I don't want corn in my apple, Monsantu. Oh yeah, and you've created an economy almost dependant on high fructose corn syrup... which is *horrible* for a person's health, and 110% unnecessary. The free market's freedom has resulted in almost every conceivable aspect of our economy being run by a select few individuals, who are *always* doing it because it's profitable, not because it's good for humanity. As long as this is allowed, the free market will not work. We've long since proven, wealth does not, nor will it ever, ""trickle down"". It always goes up. What happens when all the money goes up? The foundation collapses, and suddenly your billionaire status is meaningless, because you can't find any food either.",,1426450991,0,101,101

I agree that selling council housing was a terrible move that applied a quick fix of cash without much longterm outlook but you have to remember the people living in council houses at the time loved it.  2 million council tenants bought their homes at a discounted rate.  It was so popular that Labour refused to even contest it in the next election because it was seen as a vote loser.  The real problem was that not enough low market homes were built to replace them and councils didn't reinvest.

*Getting rid of free milk to children:* 

The school milk act was passed in post-War Britain in 1946 when there was still rationing. Children under 7 still got milk.  Children whose parents couldn't afford milk and were on benefit assistance, still got milk.  Adults in their 30s and 40s today don't walk around with bandy legs: they didn't suffer malnutrition or calcium deficiency.  Welfare, however little, was still available to the poorest to the extent that no-one had to starve.

*Privitisation of every bloody thing she could think of:*  

I agree although some of it had to be done after Callaghan.  Britain effectively went to Cash Converters and sold the family heirlooms.  In the long term it cost a lot but in the short term it was like running two cars when you couldn't afford to even put food on the table.  Something had to go.  British Airways, Rover, Rolls Royce: yes.  British Petroleum, National Freight, Royal Ordnance: no, no, no.  Big mistakes.  The controversial?  Shipyards and the coal pits: YES.  It turned a dying resource that wasn't competitive into the most efficient system.  The pits that remained open were made to be the most efficient in Europe and the operation on the scale it was was never going to be sustainable.  Then again deregulation, privatisation and the shedding of the Post Office under Labour is as big a mistake as British Petroleum was under Thatcher.  Brown went wholesale too.  Cameron is going to have to as well.  So not everything was privatised because they're still finding stuff.

*Her exemplary handling of the miner's strike:*  

That *was* actually exemplary.  It addressed the disproportionate lobbying power of the unions which could bring down governments and really harm the country.  She prevented power-cuts by ordering power stations to stockpile and she turned one of the least efficient outfits into one of the most profitable; she did it all just as people were going to stop using coal and start embracing cleaner and more developed technologies.  And she did it with a profit.  Controversial and not how it's remembered, I know, - but you have to remember that even at the time the majority of people actually empathised with the government, the pit bosses and not the pit miners and their unions.

*POLL TAX:*  

Awful isn't it.  And then they just renamed it Council Tax and every government since has supported it.  In fact, they've increased it year on year.  There should be a fairer form of taxation, but then you have to remember the UK still faces a massive deficit even now.

Most illegals work either in lanscaping and in restaurant kitchens.  You could argue that having illegals willing to work for lower wages lowers the cost of these services to Americans. This is very beneficial to the wealthy because they get these services cheaper, but most American can't afford these services.  So the American workers get the downside of competing with low wage, illegal immigrants so that the wealthy can have cheaper services.  (btw, the cost savings may not necessarily even be passed on to the consumer.   It may also simply increase the profit margin for restaurant owners and lanscape companies.)  

Ofcourse illegals are willing to work for less money because the cost of living and the standard of living in their home country as much lower.  Allowing those workers to compete with Americans, or arguing that Americans need to accept lower wages, will simply lower the american standard of living.

We surrendered pretty much without a fight and we cooperated with the Germans to the extent of providing them with a large part of their agricultural supplies. The ""cooperation""-government also approved a Danish SS-corps, Frikorps Danmark, in which 8,000 Danes served out of which half were KIA. 

A few hundred resistance fighters died during the occupation and about 1200 sailors in Allied service were lost too. Unfortunately our record is one of actually losing more Danes who served with the Axis forces than with the resistance or Allied forces. 

However, it is only within the last decades that this story has been told. Up till then a mythical picture of the Danish resistance fighter had been portrayed as what Denmark was during the war. Nobody wanted to face the uncomfortable truth, not least the politicians who had agreed to cooperating with the Germans.

If the general strike in August of 1943 against the German occupation hadn't happened, in which the cooperation-government resigned and the Germans assumed full control, we might have been labelled an Axis puppet and not an occupied country. 

On the plus side we saved all our Jews, including a bunch of my ancestors.

Finally, it should be noted that the Danish cooperation-policy did not come about because the Danes loved Germans or were sympathetic towards Nazism. There was a clear pro-Allied sentiment in the population since the Germans had been the enemy since the wars of 1848-51 and 1864. Furthermore, democratic sentiment in Denmark was very strong and the Nazi party never got more than a few percent of the votes. The argument for the cooperation-policy was that Denmark could not defend itself and might as well save itself from unnecessary destruction. Furthermore at the time in 1940 everyone was convinced that Germany would win the war (I remember my grandfather saying this too), so you had to make the best out of being in a Germany-dominated Europe. By choosing to cooperate the Danish government was allowed to retain control, Danish laws would apply (which also meant that resistance fighters weren't executed) and Danish police would continue to function.

If you're interested in reading more there's a Danish site about military history which also have English sections: http://milhist.dk/start/uk_occupation.htm

P.S. The reason your Danish acquintances probably didn't say anything is likely that their families didn't do anything during the war. That is the case for most Danes who sat out the war. Very few joined the resistance. And they couldn't have been conscripted to the SS since that was voluntary. However, they might have been conscripted to labour duty in Germany, which many Danes were forced to or chose if they couldn't get work at home.

P.P.S. Fun fact: One of my friend's grandfather served in the Danish SS corps while my own grandfather, as a Jew, was hiding from the Germans and eventually had his family evacuated to Sweden. And now their grandsons are best of pals.",,1426451057,0,1,1

Who donates the most to world organizations to help with hunger.  Who contributes the most to the UN efforts of helping refugees of war-torn African countries that displaced more than half their populations?  The U.S., on an incredible scale, donates to the common well-being of so many people on Earth.  It isn't surprising (to me) that the government feels like they need to manage the situation when they're investing so much, compared to the rest of the world.

Do you think if the EU donated so much money and man-power to so many different types of causes over the world, that they wouldn't feel a little bit like they should have influence over that situation/region/people?

Here, I will illustrate how the detail you omit undermines your conclusion.

When you state that ""climate change has always been occuring in the past,"" you omit the important detail describing *on what timescale* climate change has been occuring. With the exception of catastrophic events such as asteroid impacts, cycles in climate line up nearly perfectly with variation in the Earth's orbit known as **Milankovitch Cycles**. There are three variations which are important:
* eccentricity (is the Earth's orbit around the Sun more circular, which tends to enhance interseasonal variability, or circular, which tends to reduce it); 
* obliquity, or axial tilt (evens out the differences between insolation in the north and south hemispheres during opposing seasons); and
* precession, or the wobble of the axis of rotation (alternates which season it is in each hemisphere, relative to the Earth's distance to the sun in its orbit).

The time scale of these orbital variations is very, very large. The shortest variation operates on about a 22,000 year time scale while the largest two operate on 100- and 400 thousand year time scales. 

Human civilization has flourished in an inter-glacial period which began around 20,000 years ago. Modern agriculture has indeed thrived in a slowly warming climate. But that agriculture is relatively young - maybe 10,000 years ago, with a large emphasis on important developments less than 3,000 years ago. In the eyes of a climatologist or a geologist, the period in which human agriculture has existed is a mere snapshot of time. The climate really hasn't changed since agriculture was invented.

However, there have been short periods of relatively colder or relatively warmer weather in the past 3,000 years which have *dramatically* altered human population patterns because they had such catastrophic impacts on agriculture. Some are positive, such as the Vikings settling the New World. Some are negative, such as the warm period in medieval Europe which helped facilitate (along with other factors) the spread of disease.

Now, consider the second premise you present, ""that climate change is occuring now."" The logic in your argument makes a large assumption - that the current climate change is intrinsically similar to climate change in the past. This is false. As I noted previously, the climate change you're referring to in the past is slow and steady, occuring over 100,000 years. The climate change we're experiencing now is radically different, occuring in 150 years. 

This is problematic, and complicates the problem. Climate is essentially an equilibrium position of the atmosphere. If you stress the atmospheric system, it might deviate in large ways (e.g. this summer's heat wave in Russia and floods in Pakistan), but its behavior is relatively confined to an expected range of values. Over time, the precise equilibrium state of the atmosphere changes, with respect to temperature, storm tracks -&gt; precipitation patterns, ocean temperatures, etc. On geological time scales (read - past climate change), this occurs very slowly. In modern times, however, we're stressing the climate system far more vigorously. 

Herein lies the problem. If the equilibrium state of climate drifts slowly, it's rather easy to predict the range of variability you'd expect from it. But if it changes rapidly, things are much more complicated, because the  variability changes rapidly as well. Your conclusion presents a false dichotomoy; we're not choosing between a moderate warming trend or a cooling trend. Under the influence of anthropogenic GHG emissions, we're inducing a rapid (read - Andy Roddick-serve-fast) warming trend, versus the expected gentle, multi-millenium warming trend.

The stresses of this rapid warming trend are hard to explain to a non-atmospheric scientist. But suffice it to say that warming is the least of our concerns. The real concerns lie in the way the atmosphere's general circulation responds to these stresses. This leads to all sorts of disparate regional change. There is evidence that agriculture would be dramatically affected in various parts of the world, ranging from too much precipitation altering what crops are viable, to too little precipitation making agriculture all but impossible. This would stress human populations - particularly in the third world, where even minor shocks to the agricultural systems would not be survivable and would lead to the displacement of millions of impoverished people. But it would also stress the first world, and require a great deal of money to deal with; what would happen if warming temperatures and reduced annual precipitation induced a long-term Dust Bowl event in the Great Plains? There are some studies that have suggested that this would be a prominent regional effect of climate change, were the world 2 deg.F warmer by 2100 (a likely scenario at this point). 

In summer, (**TL;DR**), the premises of your argument do not reflect the current situation, and on top of that, you present a false dichotomy of choices in your conclusion. The correct choice is, instead, to reduce GHG emissions and limit the amount of warming/climate change.

Even in post-crash Argentina, when many people resorted to barter and unemployment/inflation reached catastrophic levels, people still buy certain goods and services.  

I firmly believe that even the US economy is fundamentally robust enough to maintain a level of this that is sufficient to base a slow-but-solid recovery on; ideally, this would be part of a rebalancing (since I imagine we agree that US consumer spending was very very severely out of whack before the crash.)

According to Wikipedia, 4.3 million civilians were killed during Vietnam and even if the US was basically stepping into a civil war... it certainly propagated the decimation of the country.

As an American, looking back at the past fifty years makes me uneasy about my country. I don't consider myself a libertarian (at all), but the best thing the US seems to have done in the past fifty years is have its citizens buy stuff from third world countries and accelerate their rise from poverty. Interference in the Balkans was good too, but it was pursued with less energy than the US's non-humanitarian wars.

In the past fifty years there have been very few (non-civil) wars that haven't been instigated by the US or the USSR. They are the Iran-Iraq War, the various Israeli war, and two wars in the Congo.

And the US was involved indirectly in the first two.

Then you have the war in Afghanistan (1 million civilians dead, according to Wikipedia) and the Chechnyan conflict, which may or may not be a civil war depending on how you slice it.

Then there's the US, getting involved in Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq for its major wars. But there's also a long list of dictators propped and democracies toppled, plus a failure for the world's most powerful military to intervene in post-Cold War genocide except in one small (European) part of the world.

Really the only consolation I draw is that the US is less rapacious than Europe was in the 19th century or than history indicates Stalin's USSR or Mao's China would have been otherwise. Or Hitler's Germany or Imperial Japan.

So I feel like the US was the least bad possibility, which isn't very encouraging.

I'm conflicted about it. It was a war, but a dead person is still a dead person, and 40 million dead people are still 40 million dead people.

The life expectancy rate was 49 years old! The difference between then and now is that they didn't have the technology to save people back then. Now, we do, and by not providing health care to those who can't afford it, you are essentially casting them out on their own. 

&gt;Now-a-days we 'expect"" to get stuff from the government.

&gt;Thanks in large part to the US, the military budgets of these countries has been a token amount of their GDP and they've had the ability focus on their own internal affairs

This is laughable. The military budgets of European countries weren't huge because they didn't *need to defend themselves from anything*. Americans are enamored with the good-evil dichotomy. There is NOT ALWAYS SOMEONE OUT TO GET YOU! We don't *need* to spend 23% of our income on defense, we don't *need* to be the world's police force.

&gt;flooded with European immigrants even to this day

[This is so wrong it's funny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States). You make up this world view in your head that is completely separated from reality.

&gt;So you wonder why these immigrants are leaving thier ""utopian"" society for the barbaric US?

Europe is certainly not perfect, I just think socialized medicine is the humane way to go. You are turning this into a Euro-American culture war, when it's not. 

&gt;Maybe what you should do is pack your bags and say goodbye to your homeland (just like my parents) and start a new course in a foreign land. I'm sure you'll find an elnclave of Americans to commiserate with. 

Just because I think the government should be providing health care to citizens rather than for profit corporations? Again, you are turning this into a culture war. It's not. 

&gt;want something that's not in the game plan of the Constitution. 

It's debatable whether the Constitution gives the government the power to socialize medicine, but here's my beef: the people who wrote the Constitution **were just men**. Mortal, human men. They are spoken of as *gods* in the US, and they weren't. They did an amazing job of setting things up, but they wrote that document well over 250 years ago. They couldn't possibly foresee what the country would turn into and the challenges the world as a whole would face. 

&gt;So you see, it's not about Health Care.

It was before you turned it into a culture war

&gt;American's are the most generous people on earth and we used to have doctors make house visits. We had charity hospitals. I'll tell you what, I'd much rather have nonprofits like Habitiat for Humanity, the Goodwill, and The Humane society run a local charity hospital than a faceless Washington Bureaucrat any day

Hospitals don't get very far on charity. That's why the best ones are for profit. And why does everyone assume government employees are hearthless scum? Have you ever met a GS15 or SES? They're normal people too, just as normal as you or I or Habitat for Humanity. The only difference is who signs their checks, and the **oath** they take to serve the US Government.

Most of the time conservatives will parrot the points that Fox makes without actually understanding why those points are evil besides vague references to Soviet Russia or Hitler.  It's something of the modus operandi with these people, so just pushing that point might even get them to realize that they have nothing to fear about a European-style economic system akin to the German one (which is now chugging along again).

I think a lot of the fear that gets placed into arguments about Socialism is that it drives away ingenuity, drives away the so-called Protestant work ethic, and that these two factors make it unAmerican.  For that, it's important to make them realize that a safety net is not something that will make people lazier or something that will cripple American businesses.  Very few people are going to just quit working because they have free health care (although for some of the elderly, this might be the case, and rightfully so).  No one's going to quit a job, even at McDonalds, so they can cash a $500/month welfare check for the rest of their lives either.

Most people that talk about the Khazars, do so as ""proof"" that the Jews of today are not related to the Jews of early times.

The Khazar myth has been debunked by Y-chromossome studies. More exactly,

Y chromosome evidence for a founder effect in Ashkenazi Jews

[...]In particular, according to Middle Age historians, the Khazars from a small kingdom near the Caspian Sea converted en masse to Judaism and therefore might have contributed to the composition of the emerging Ashkenazi community. Yet, recent genetic studies, based on Y chromosome polymorphic markers, clearly showed that Ashkenazim are more closely related to other Jewish and Middle Eastern groups than to their host populations in Europe. Those findings argue against large-scale male-mediated gene flow into the Ashkenazi community during the Diaspora. The male admixture proportion of Europeans in Ashkenazi Jews was estimated to be 0.5% per generation, indicating that Ashkenazim remained, to a large extent, genetically isolated throughout their history.""

It's genuinely appreciated.  

I'd agree that there's definitely not a lot of really strong links between Luther's anti-semitism and the Nazis.  I tend to side with the people who posit that Luther's anti-semitism was mostly brought up after the fact to lend populist credibility to the Nazi's racial theories, similar to the way Hitler and a lot of other Nazi leaders spoke fondly of Christianity in public but were often critical of it at best in private and downright loathed it at worst.  I also think the idea that Lutheran anti-semitism was something deeply embedded in German culture and history is also not very well-founded.  Up until the Nazis took power Germany, while surely having anti-semitism in its society, was generally thought to be one of the more enlightened and tolerant European countries.  It certainly didn't have the same problems with anti-semitic pogroms and scapegoating as much of Eastern Europe, Spain, or even France, so that connection seems a bit tenuous to me.

I think this also ties into Nazism being more of a secular movement than a religious one, which is another disagreement I have with the thread title.

Slavery has been pretty endemic in most major societies since the beginning of recorded history, and I think it's one good thing to be proud of in a European-descended heritage that we banned it, and largely put a stop to it in much of the world.

Population size means absolutely nothing. Statistically it would be easier to select 11 good players out of 1 billion than it would 1 million, but the difference is the quality of those players is not proportional to the population size. There are more footballers in China than Costa Rica, but if you take random 11 players the probability is that the Costa Ricans ones will be much better.

""Interest in soccer"" is irrelevant. How do you gauge interest? Brazil's Série A has an average stadium attendance that is smaller than of most MLS teams. A lot more people watch and follow football in England than Uruguay. Does interest relate to more people playing it? Yes, but there is no guarantee they will be any sort of decent.

Wealth and health is absolutely irrelevant too. It's even more irrelevant when one cites countries like China or Turkey (or even India) where the greatest parcel of that wealth is taken by a superior cast of society that will never play a single game of soccer. Economic growth in developing countries *very rarely* translate into greater personal financial wealth at the bottom level. There is also no correlation between wealth and soccer ability either: Ivory Coast fields better teams than European counterparts.

Then there's this: what is a challenge to the traditional powers? Turkey reached the semis in 02, never did anything after that. Croatia was great in 98, never showed its face again. An one-time stint doesn't make a nation a new superpower. Uruguay most likely won't repeat their 2010 performance for a *long* time.

&gt; Europeans at the beginning of the Renaissance were more aware of ancient Greek and Roman scholars than of more recent Asian or African scholars

If you dig further in this subject, you'll find that Europeans [got access to Greeks](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Aristotle#Loss_and_preservation_of_his_works) works through translations saved by Muslims at that time (Dark Ages didn't conserve the works of the Greeks!). This implies their access to other works than only translations.

I do not think they rejected scholars, as some works in Optics, Astronomy, Algebra (name of Arabic origin) , Chemistry (name of Arabic origin), ... were using results from Muslims scholars.

What about the US and European media, do you feel the same about them?  I really can't agree.   

&gt;Israel knows damn well it's being watched very closely.  But for some reason, people still accuse them of being outright criminals with murderous intent.

You imply that since Israel is aware that it is being watched closely, it would never act criminally or with murderous intent.   But seriously when has Israel ever cared what the world thinks?   There is evidence that the murder of the people on the flotilla was planned in advance, but admittedly not all the facts are known, in large part because the Israelis have confiscated most of the physical evidence.  As for other acts of murderous intent, planned long in advance, and supposedly justified out of a need for 'self-defense', there are myriad examples.   E.g., the murder of several hundred Palestinian policemen on the first day of Cast Lead. ""At least 230 Palestinians were killed and more than 700 injured on the first day of air strikes. Civilians, including children, were among the casualties.  Human rights groups critically note that the attacks began around the time children were leaving school.""  That's from [Wikipedia](http://www.imemc.org/article/59294).  I would add that the attack on the policemen was timed to coincide with a graduation ceremony, so that they would be all outside and therefore easier targets.  [Does Israel's care what the world thinks?](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=Israel+%22who+cares+what+the+world+thinks%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=1&amp;cad=b)

&gt; prototype vehicle (that he built in 1985)
    
*Your statement implies that his vehicle contains only technology that was available in 1985. In reality, he's been improving the design and it now includes modern technology.*

&gt; on one tank of gas

*The fact that he used only one tank of gas is irrelevant if we don't know how big the tank was. In practice, that may be a trivial point because I've discovered that his fuel economy was 119.1 mpg (2 l/100km) which is actually pretty awesome.*

&gt; automakers continue to insist that he tech just isn't feasible

*They don't. In fact, all the innovations used in his design are employed in modern vehicles. In Europe, small diesel cars with fuel economy in excess of 80 mpg are commonplace and affordable. But Americans won't buy tiny cars, and won't by diesel cars either. Also, among his modifications was a light-weight composite and aluminum body. That is incredibly expensive. Vehicles are built with that type of body but they're usually either luxury vehicles loaded with heavy accessories or race cars. People won't pay $100 000 for better fuel economy!  Also, his aerodynamic design would be illegal in most places because it doesn't have proper bumpers and would push pedestrians under the wheels in a collision. Aerodynamic efficiency has to be balanced against safety concerns.* 

People are constantly accusing automakers of conspiring to make cars inefficient. But in practice, the fuel efficiency of cars has been improving steadily. Every new fuel-saving innovation has been implemented. A short list would include fuel injection, electronic ignition, MAP sensors, turbochargers, intercoolers, continuously variable transmissions, unibody frames, composite materials, aluminum engine blocks, microprocessor-controlled cooling, aerodynamic shapes, automatic tire pressure control, high-flow exhaust systems... Even the change from generators to alternators was done to improve fuel efficiency. 

Hell, if you're willing to spend $140 000, you can have an all-electric car that performs just as well as a gasoline vehicle, provided you're willing to settle for something that can carry only two people and has no trunk space. Tesla Roadster FTW!

Regarding this article I can add another gem:
&gt;Some years ago, the scientist Joseph Needham made an epic study of technological development in China. He wanted to find out why China, for all its early gifts of innovation, had fallen so far behind Europe in the advancement of science.

Here is what [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Needham#The_Needham_Question) has to say about this:
&gt;""Needham's Grand Question"", also known as ""The Needham Question"", is why China had been overtaken by the West in science and technology, despite its earlier successes. His works attribute significant weight to the impact of Confucianism and Taoism  on the pace of Chinese scientific discovery, and emphasizes what it describes as the 'diffusionist' approach of Chinese science as opposed to a perceived independent inventiveness in the western world. Needham's accusations against Confucianism and Taoism can arguably be seen as simply reflecting early Chinese Communist hostility to these rival thought systems.

While it can be debatable whether if political views had to do anything with this, clearly Christianity isn't mentioned as significant factor, if mentioned at all (tl;dr).

Minor laws have already been passed that eliminated several mom and pop ISPs  The unifying point that we ""Pro net neutrality"" people on the forums is that if Net Neutrality were institutionalized on a large scale, it would make it harder for lobbyists to work against net neutrality, as well as provide a backbone for civil suits, should individuals find that they are swindled by their ISP (Such as the comcast throttling issue).

I can understand the desire to not see the same issue as we had with Health Care, and broken promises.  There is a major difference though, in that we have net neutrality *right now*, in a sense.  The problem is that big ISPs are chiseling away at it as fast as they can.  Institutionalizing the status quo can preserve the internet we know and love.  Who knows how long it will last otherwise?",,1426451638,0,2,2

There are 3 issues that always interested me. 

a) The sun schedule. If I'm not mistaken, certain parts of Sweden get no more than 3 hours of sun during winter. Is this a big concern or just a natural part of life? Do you adjust your social/work schedule based on how much sun you'll have on a certain season? In Argentina, we are quite ""outdoor"" people. We do lots of outdoor activities (sports, barbecues, sightseeing). I'm assuming indoor activities are more commonplace over there. Is that so? Also, how predominant is the night life (pubs/discos/etc.) given that nights are so long?

b) I've heard tons of things about Jantelagen and how it's a very real thing in Sweden. I have to say I feel it's a very interesting behaviour and in general I find it positive. But, how do you, as a society, react towards someone who's naturally gifted for any particular activity/task? Are, for example, boys/girls with high IQ hindered in their learning ny the educative system  in order to be more like the other kids? Maybe what I'm saying is: According to Jantelagen is it frown upon to be better than other persons in any particular activity? Or is it ok/acceptable as long as you don't make a big deal out of it? Where is it more notorious?

c) This might be indirectly connected with the previous item, but how self aware are you about your position in the world as one of those countries ""everyone would like to live in""? I mean, having lived all your life there, you'd probably say ""ehh, it's no big deal, we have our pros and cons"" but, are you aware of how different society is as a whole when compared to: 1) Other non-nordic European countries? 2) USA? 3) The rest of the world in general?... I come from a country where the law in business/relationships is survival of the fittest. People are constantly trying to step over other people's heads to get a promotion, to steal such person's boyfriend/girlfriend, to fall in someone's favor, and the ultimate goal here for most people is to find the way to get money without working. Nepotism is VERY common, specially in governmental positions, police is easy to bribe, we can't leave anything unattended nor any door (car or house) unlocked because if someone notices, it's a matter of time until someone breaks in, and here we have an interesting point. It's not that it's full of thieves, people won't probably bother to rob a locked car or house, but some of them will seize the opportunity if given the chance. Greatest examples of this are, for example, when you pay to a cashier and he/she gives you more change than he/she had to, 90% of people will just shut up and take the extra change (unless the difference is too big, which will trigger guilt on most people). Same if you're walking and, say, you drop some cash. If someone's behind you, it's not too much cash and they're pretty positive no one's looking, they'll probably keep it. Petty things, but lots of them. What are the social things that upset you about your city/country?

Those are a lot of questions! So to wrap up, a few loose questions:
Would you say swedish people are less friendly than the average european? 

Would you say you and/or your group of friends/acquaintances are more or less friendly than the average swedish person?

What's your opinion on having ~10% immigrant population?

I guess this is a good start! Feel free to answer the ones you like, no need to answer them all, but those are the things that interest me the most about Sweden right now.

Statistically it would be easier to select 11 good players out of 1 billion than it would 1 million, but the difference is the quality of those players is not proportional to the population size. There are more footballers in China than Costa Rica, but if you take random 11 players the probability is that the Costa Ricans ones will be much better.

Population irrelevant? Let's look at the top 5 of the FIFA Rankings:

* Spain: 46 Million
* Netherlands: 15 Million
* Brazil: 192 Million
* Argentina: 40 Million
* Germany: 82 Million

And now the bottom 5:

* Papua New Guinea: 7 Million
* Central African Republic: 4 Million
* American Samoa: 66 Thousand
* Montserrat: 4 Thousand
* Anguilla: 14 Thousand

Of course a big population does not guarantee lots of great footballers, but it definitely increases the changes. That's why a country with &lt; 1 Million inhabitants has almost 0% of ever winning the world cup.

&gt; ""Interest in soccer"" is irrelevant. How do you gauge interest? Brazil's Série A has an average stadium attendance that is smaller than of most MLS teams. A lot more people watch and follow football in England than Uruguay. Does interest relate to more people playing it? Yes, but there is no guarantee they will be any sort of decent.

Interest is irrelevant because you don't know how to gauge it? that doesn't make much sense.

&gt; Wealth and health is absolutely irrelevant too. It's even more irrelevant when one cites countries like China or Turkey (or even India) where the greatest parcel of that wealth is taken by a superior cast of society that will never play a single game of soccer. Economic growth in developing countries very rarely translate into greater personal financial wealth at the bottom level. There is also no correlation between wealth and soccer ability either: Ivory Coast fields better teams than European counterparts.

I would like to see a scatter plot of FIFA Ranking vs GDP before i decide of there is a correlation or not. I think there would be a correlation, with some exceptions of course.

Sands tested for discrimination directly by sending out identical scripts, one written by authors with male names, such as Michael and George, and one written by authors with female names, such as Mary and Jennifer, to artistic directors and literary managers, asking for their reviews. The reviewers consistently rated Mary's script much more negatively than Michael's script, even though the only difference in the script was in the author's name.""

&gt; and we don't make them suffer. In fact, it's uneconomical to stress them at all. Large numbers of animals are brought to life, something that wouldn't happen in a vegan society. They are fed, sheltered, kept healthy and well treated.

Either you aren't very well informed or you are being disingenuous.

There are quite a number of common factory farming practices specifically targeted to prevent animals from damaging themselves due to the stress they experience. Here are a few selections for your edification: 

* [Debeaking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debeaking) - ""The disadvantages include acute stress and short-term and perhaps long-term pain following a beak trim. A bird’s ability to consume feed is impaired following beak trimming because of the new beak shape that the young bird must adapt to. The welfare advantages include reduced pecking, feather pulling, and cannibalism; better feather condition; decreased mortality; and a lower level of flock fearfulness and nervousness leading to less chronic stress.""

* [Battery cages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_cage) - ""Animal welfare scientists have been critical of battery cages because they do not provide hens with sufficient space to stand, walk, flap their wings, perch, or make a nest, and it is widely considered that hens suffer through boredom and frustration through being unable to perform these behaviours.""

* [Gestation crate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation_crate) - Michael Morris of Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand writes that many studies have shown that sows in crates exhibit behavior such as bar-biting, head weaving, and tongue rolling. They also show behavior that indicates learned helplessness, according to Morris, such as remaining passive when poked or when a bucket of water is thrown over them.[12] A review by the Scientific Veterinary Council of the European Commission states that repetitive 'stereotypical' behaviour has been found in 'every detailed study' of pigs in gestation crates, but not in any other housing systems examined.

I think it would also be difficult to argue that those practices do not cause suffering.

&gt; They are fed, sheltered, kept healthy and well treated. The only possible objection is that we are the ones to decide when their life ends instead of letting nature take its course in its normal inhumane fashion. Rather, their life ends without suffering after a peaceful existence. I see nothing immoral about such symbiotic relation.

That is an idyllic situation which does not encompass the typical production of meat/dairy/eggs. In practice, the animal leads a very short (usually less than 25% of the typical lifespan) miserable life and then is killed (and in more than a few instances, even this is botched).

&gt; You may feel that it's wrong, but that's an emotional response, not a rational look at their condition. And that's fine, you can feel as you like about it and be vegan, but I will feel as I want as well and I reject your suggestion of moral superiority.

Would it be okay to do the same to other humans?",,1426451776,0,2,2

The subsequent generation inherits 125 million apiece, and so on. Granted, this process is not instantaneous, but it does serve as a natural limiting process independently of any taxes.

I can't help but want to administer a mental head slap.

When I was a kid (maybe 8-10) I was talking to a guy at a library, and for some reason it came up that he was a hunter. I berated him about it and he said ""Well, you eat meat don't you? How's that different?"" and I was left without anything to say. It made me think, though, and at 11 I became a vegetarian (not specifically because of that event, but I think it likely contributed). Hypocrisy doesn't necessarily mean I was wrong, it just means I need to change my behavior to align with what I believe to be right. :)

&gt; My only real experience with vegetarian/vegan has been on both sides of the extreme. One is a man that is a decade plus older then myself (he's in his 60's now I think) and a young lady who is probably a decade younger then myself (she's in he 30's). [snip snip anecdote]

I don't think you really can draw a conclusion for a sample size of two. Sedentary people aren't going to have much muscle mass or be in shape. It's also plenty easy to become fat as a vegan (for example, a single cup of dry white rice has 800 calories. I can easily eat that much). The study I linked to previously is a much better source of information than anecdote (even though I don't entirely agree with it).

&gt; Even if you're not killing an animal to eat you're killing some by merely existing. You displace small mice and other rodents and potentially impact the lives of countless large animals. You cannot remove your impact on the environment. None of us can. One can minimize or guide but not eliminate. Not to mention the land it takes to grow your food. Just because you're not tilling the ground doesn't mean someone isn't. You hold some liability on the impact on the deer impacted both positively and negatively by this farming.

That is absolutely true. I take step to reduce the harm I cause, but I fall (extremely) far short of perfection. I harbor no illusions on that subject. However, the steps I take are not onerous, and if something is easy and it's the right thing to do, well... I think it should be done!

&gt; As far as ""the terrible conditions where they suffer"" I can tell you from growing up around cattle and hunting that in general they just don't exist. I've seen the horror videos and I won't even try to deny their existence. They just haven't been the norm that I've seen. 

My points on terrible conditions of course do not apply to hunting. I am guessing your experience with cattle is from small to mid sized farms, not gigantic factory farms. I'm sure the conditions are considerably better in that case, but the question you have to ask is: What percentage of meat/dairy/eggs come from small family farms, and what percentage come from the giant factory farms? (Spoiler: From its American and West European heartland factory farming became globalised in the later years of the twentieth century and is still expanding and replacing traditional practices of stock rearing in an increasing number of countries. In 1990 factory farming accounted for 30% of world meat production. By 2005 this had risen to 40%. {source:[wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_farming#History)})

&gt; Without the mass production of food, both vegetable and animal there would be no way for even a half of our population to survive though.

I agree with the first part of your sentence. However, I doubt removing the mass production of meat would cause a serious issue (other than people adjusting to doing without it). An extremely large percentage of vegetable farming exists to feed animals. Converting vegetable matter to animal products is a quite inefficient process. It would be a lot more efficient to just farm plants.

&gt; While I know of some vegan and vegetarian athletes none of them are competing in a muscle heavy sport. Long distance runners and triathletes being the ones that come to mind. You just won't find them in wrestling, football, basketball, or any contact sport. Runner's benefit from the lighter weight muscle mass. This again accounts for why a lot of them look emaciated and appear older then their age.

Sorry to be blunt, but you are completely wrong in your assertion.

I would agree that your belief may be cohesive if you would apply that same logic to killing and eating other humans (possibly babies or young children that wouldn't have the ability to reflect on their fate).",,1426451933,0,1,1

Wealthy businessmen have tried to suppress technology in the past, and it has never worked. Edison tried to monopolize the motion picture industry and his methods involved a lot of dirty moves that would be impossible under modern laws. He ended up bankrupting his own movie studio! He tried to bury competing phonograph technologies as well and that also backfired. American cell phone companies tried to bury the GSM system; now you're all getting either GSM or 3GSM phones. American banks tried to bury the Interac system. You now have Interac at all your bank machines, although you still don't have debit cards (what you have is actually a prepaid credit card disguised as a debit card). 

Companies that manufacture pesticides are trying to suppress Genetically Modified Crops that would make their own pesticides obsolete. This is why there are so many posts on Reddit slandering Monsanto. Germany has banned their GMO corn, and Haitian farmers were persuaded to burn seed stock that was given to them for free as part of an international effort to rebuild Haiti's agricultural sector. Ultimately, people will snap out of the conspiracy theories and realize that the environment benefits tremendously from crops that don't need to be doused with poison every few months. 

As you can see, the tactics are changing. Laws won't allow the sort of dirty tricks that Edison tried to use to suppress his competitors' inventions: registering American patents for things invented and patented in Europe, filing frivolous patent lawsuits to drain their legal budgets, creating moral outrage to suppress European films, and so on. But these days they've learned that Greenwashing works miracles, and bypasses every legal boundary. The quasi-environmentalist wording and pseudoscientific illogic of the ""natural"" movement makes it practically impossible to fight against claims made by green-washers. This has made libel viable as a marketing tactic. 

Curiously, there is a small kernel of truth to the idea that somebody suppressed electric cars, but it goes way back. There was a time when electric cars performed almost as well as gasoline cars. They had trouble going uphill, and had a shorter range. But they were just as fast. Gasoline cars had no suspension back then and they shook themselves to pieces when driving cobble-stoned roads! They also stank horribly and soaked the air with noxious fumes. When you see pictures of people in old cars, they're wearing a cloak; this is to keep the stench of exhaust fumes out of their clothing. Electric cars were superior. But the makers of gasoline cars published attack ads claiming that the electric cars were dangerous. The old batteries would spray acid everywhere in an accident, and burn the occupants horribly. And the old wiring wasn't exactly perfect, so people were occasionally electrocuted by their cars. The gas-car manufacturers had a higher advertising budget and the courts weren't willing or able to prevent them from slandering the competition back then. So they flooded the public with exaggerated slander and people stopped buying electric cars. Even back then, the only effective way to bury a technology was to slander it. ",,1426451939,0,4,4

Clearly you've never been to the US. Explain to me, wise one who has no need of facts for their conclusion: What's your opinion of most of Pacific Coasts and New England? Do the policies of the Conservatives/Thatcherites differ considerably from the GOP policies (taking the differing starting points in mind)? Obama couldn't really be described as a fiscal conservative by any stretch of the imagination but [oddly enough, most Americans still approve](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/images/09/03/rel12a.pdf)...weird, right? If I didn't know better I might say that either the American people's tolerance of higher taxes is underrated or they don't really prioritize it as highly as you seem to think they do.

Even with all that, I'm still trying to remain intellectually honest and admit, yes, this is probably just an odd time where people are tolerating higher taxes/spending if it prevents the worst, and Obama was carried in with a high tide, so that might explain some of the numbers, but it still doesn't put the US in the position of being insanely against taxation, which seems to be what you're saying. 

To go back a bit, yes if you hold an idea that seems mostly just held for the fact that it says something negative about another country, rather than it being true, then yeah that strikes me as a bit nationalistic, especially when it's coming from someone who (I don't know what country you're from so I can't be specific, but I'll assume Western Europe, probably British from your tone) resides in a country that was until recent history a colonial power (I'm also assuming you're not form Andorra, just playing the numbers game).

I can say with authority that security theater is bullshit, what London, other parts of Europe, and plenty of other places *outside* the US go through regularly would bring ""small town Americans"" to overly paranoid tears and fear... signing away the rest of our liberties for empty comfort.

I don't remember being scared at the time of the bombings,  mostly because most of the people we traveled with were not scared.  They didn't function on fear, they functioned on intelligent caution, but still went about their day.  This attitude was contagious and so everyone went about their day, not as though nothing had happened, but they didn't allow the situations around them cripple their ability to work or travel.

I am guessing the question was U.S. focused, as in some countries dying from a terrorist bomb is more common than getting hit by a bus.

Start small, and just get a few basic (cheap) necessities, something to hold you over for a short while, until you reach your goal. Just something to think about. I know people who spent over $10,000 on a new wardrobe only to donate them to Goodwill in less than two years when they decided that they want to lose 40 pounds, or whatever. Used clothing has very little value, even if it's a $8000 bespoke suit you got from the best suit maker in all of Europe. 


A very easy 'smart casual' look to go for would be, in my opinion: navy blazer over a sharp, tailored dress shirt, coupled with jeans (make sure they're tailored and nothing like what you're wearing in that picture), with walnut colored wing-tips. If you're willing to spend some money ($1000? or something, retail price), I'd recommend getting a blazer from Hugo Boss (pretty poor quality, but good for the price if you get discounts on it. You can get their blazers discounted for $250-$500), dress shirt from Barney's New York (love their dress shirts; their in-house brand goes for ~$200 but you can get it for lower easily), and for wing-tips I love Allen Edmonds. Allen Edmonds sells one of the best introductory-luxury shoes in the whole world, IMO, and it's very affordable at just $300-$500, or less if you get it with sales/used. If you take proper care for it the shoes will serve you for decades.



I want to again emphasize of getting stuff tailored; NOTHING you wear should be baggy and floating down you like a ""waterfall"". If you look at the picture you posted, you'd notice that your jacket is at least two sizes too big for you, and is way too long at the sleeve. Your pants are flowing down your legs freely; tailor it. Your shirt is also very, very baggy; again, you want to have your stuff tailored. It costs less than $20 to tailor each individual clothing, and nothing makes a person look sloppy like clothes that are too big/too small for you. A perfect fit is a must.

The Titanic sank in April 1912.  John Jacob Astor IV went down with the ship and with him the resistance movement.  The RMS Titanic was built by a company owned by J.P. Morgan.  J.P. Morgan was intended to be on the ship but he backed out at the last minute.  After the Titanic sank and the Federal Reserve Act passed in December 1912, J.P. Morgan went to Rome to report to his masters.  He died there soon afterwards.  Upon J.P. Morgan's death it was found that he only owned one-third of his estate where as the Rothschild family owned the other two-thirds.  Then one year later the international bankers had enough access to credit to create World War I in 1914.  At the end of World War I they created the League of Nations and they ensured through vindictive treaties that there would be a follow up world war soon afterwards.  Then they helped economically destroy Germany and then they poured money into it to build up the war machine.  After the war they created the next level of world government with the United Nations.

Its all carefully engineered and they do not hesitate to sacrifice in order to achieve their goals.

Well I can form my own expectation of future inflation. Once I have done this I can determine whether the prices in the market for bonds, equities, and money market accurately reflect a risk free rate of return plus expected inflation plus a risk premium. If they do not, then I would seek to short these assets and I would expect their prices to fall in order for them to provide a yield sufficient to cover those components of return. If they provided more than the required level of return I would go long the assets because they are cheap relative to my expectations.

You cannot do _anything remotely like that_ for gold. You simply have to suck your thumb and guess if gold is over- or under-priced.

The whole claim that the Southern economy was inferior to that of the North was a post war invention, designed to help foster the myth of the 'lost cause.'

&gt;The North was able to afford to put bigger armies and, more importantly, put a fleet to sea that could blockade the southern coast line.

Sweden is a very oblong country so it varies a lot. Southern Sweden gets 7+ hours of sunlight during the winter and in parts of northern Sweden the sun never rises. There is an interesting app if you want more detailed info: http://www.prognosen.se/sol.php

&gt; Is this a big concern or just a natural part of life? Do you adjust your social/work schedule based on how much sun you'll have on a certain season? 

People adept to it. When my mother first came to Sweden the constant darkness really depressed her, she would sit by the window and wait for the sun to rise. She's gradually gotten used to it, but she stills doesn't like travelling north during the winter. =)

I personally love the winter months because the combination of several feet of snow and evening darkness can be incredibly cozy. Kind of like [this](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2315/2238170998_04e8ac9c2b.jpg).

The work pattern doesn't change much, unless you're in a job that requires sunlight (such as farming).

&gt; In Argentina, we are quite ""outdoor"" people. We do lots of outdoor activities (sports, barbecues, sightseeing). I'm assuming indoor activities are more commonplace over there. Is that so? Also, how predominant is the night life (pubs/discos/etc.) given that nights are so long?

Swedes love being outdoors, so we cherish the summer months and try to spend as much time outside as possible when we have the chance. During the winter months we become more of an ""indoor"" people, but people still like to go out skiing even when there's no sunlight.

The night life is quite similar to other european countries, but be warned - swedes love to get drunk =)

Their plan to transition themselves to a society free from oil is worthwhile for many reasons, not least of which is to reduce the country's CO2 emissions.

If you actually look at how Sweden is reducing it's dependency on oil, you'll find that the Carbon tax is an integral part of the policy. Firstly, it encourages alternatives to oil in transportation. Without the tax there would be less incentive for consumers to move away from petrol for their cars or oil for their heating. And secondly, the revenue from the tax pays for all the subsidies that are being spent on things like public transportation, energy efficiency in homes, renewable energy, waste reduction, etc etc etc.

And you're wrong when you say that all the EU has carbon taxation. So far, a few other countries have brought in modest, limited taxes on certain types of fossil fuels, but these are all at a far lower level than Swedens.

You say that we should encourage green technologies and a shift away from fossil fuels, but you give no details about why or how. If reducing CO2 emissions isn't the aim, then what is?

Western European-descended persons tend to name their children Western European-derived names, such as William or Jennifer or Charles. It's an established convention, and it's regarded as normal by those people. To give children a name from a foreign culture seems strange (As much as I petitioned my sister to name her son after Ichiro Suzuki of the Mariners, it was pointless: she still went with ""Jack""). In the case of some recent immigrants, especially from Asian countries, they will give their children European names intensionally because the majority white population feel more comfortable with those names, and it speeds the process of integration. Others will continue to use names traditional to their culture of origin.

American Blacks, however, are neither recent nor distant immigrants, but the descendants of slaves brought against their will. They came from many tribes and spoke many languages, but when they became slaves their language and traditions and even their names were taken from them, since during that time their names were selected by the slaveholders. In truth, these folks have about as much reason to give their own children Anglo or German or Dutch names as my sister has to give her child a Japanese or Swahili name. In fact even less so, since to do so evokes that history of their ancestors being enslaved to those groups.

A large part of the bible was indeed written approximately around the European Bronze age. I don't understand how you can disagree with me on this one.

My point was simple. It's asinine to assume that the supposed creator of the Universe would give his message to some ignorant people thousands of years ago in a specific region in the middle east. There is nothing in the scriptures to show that they weren't written and invented by people who lived in their respective time periods.

That was the intent of my post. And you completely turned a blind eye to that and started criticizing the specifics of who personally wrote them. They were obviously not farmers, this was a joke believe it or not.

Organisations are only as valuable to society as they are to individual welfare. A union is valuable in being able to help labor improve its conditions by creating an artificial modification to the labor supply curve.

This argument is like a faith-based initiative. Go to europe, unions have just as many negative components as they have positive ones, and while I think they should have more power now than they do to compensate for the enormous power of the owning class(in the US), I do not think they are, in and of themselves, a naturally positive/noble/divine concept.

I hate the socialize, become friends, get serious model that seems to be pervasive here (obviously, I'm generalizing). The wonderful thing about 'dating', as I'm sure it'll get a lot of hate in this thread, is that you can ask out a completely random person(not as common here) and there is a clear cut (2nd/3rd date?) cut-off period. Where if you decide to not stay with the person, I feel he doesn't hold it against you, even if you bump into him later. The other nice thing about dating is that it's really efficient. Efficiency towards socializing seems really looked down upon here. You can go out with a bunch of people (use it as an exercise to better yourself and your social skills) and then decide who you fit well with. You also have time to decide, cause while you are 'dating' you are able to go out with other people. That way you aren't going off of images that seem to fit. I meet many people that seem amazing and we just don't work. Also, I meet many people that I wouldn't in a million years think we'd have a serious relationship, but somehow it just works. The people that I go on a single date with, even if I decide not to see them again, make me a better person cause they are trying to 'impress' me. They tell me about interesting books, etc that I wouldn't have considered since I wouldn't be friends with this person (hence, the cut-off). I feel in Europe you mainly go out with people you have a hunch you're going to be serious with. But relationship types (serious, bullshit, open, sex, etc)seem to be more overtly varied in America. I think in America, we are more extreme, so extremely dumb but also extremely intellectual. So I find dating in America the conversations are about topics, where as in Europe, even if you date intellectuals, they are quite hesitant to talk about it. As if social time should be for other topics. I find this in general, making friends as well. Some may prefer it, but I hate this.

 I also like all the mores that come with American dating. For example the first date is often the coffeeshop/drink. Quick and easy, can go for hours but can also be cut off so you don't waste a ton of time and can still face the person again if need be. I also like the fanciness of dating. Getting dressed up (though in Europe, people tend to be more dressed up in general)and showing another person your best side. I feel like it makes me a better person, and if we do get into a relationship, (this idea is from [Dan Savage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ObrFwjesno)), he holds you up to that standard making you the better person you were projecting. I think this is less so the case when you just socialize as in the European model. They may see more of the real you cause the interactions are more frequent/more casual, but I truly believe a good relationship goes one step beyond authenticity into a place where you both make each other a better person. 

The problem with socializing and then getting in to a relationship is that often, there are others involved so cutting off is not as easy. And the relationship feels as if its changed after the cut off (much more so in Europe and less in America). I feel, they are much quicker to get serious. Also, I don't know if this is the case, but from my impression there are a lot more people in shitty long term relationships here than in America. That may be cause we are choosier. But I think it also has to do with the lack of social pressure that builds up when you meet someone is a common setting. I think partly the reason that there is less dating is cause there are so many more social areas where people congregate and you can bump into the same person over and over. After a couple of times you might as well have been on a couple of 'dates'- but without the wonderful stomach turns and fanciness and self-evaluation etc.  In America, especially in the suburbs, everything is so individualistic, you have to take a chance if you meet someone 'interesting', you may never see them again. I also find more androgyny in America. Both men and women are more likely to break gender norms. If I meet one more (admittedly sexy) Italian man doing the I-flirt-cause-I'm-an-Italian-male thing, I'm going to push them into the closest canal. 

Similarities are the types of people. There are just as many New York douchebags as there are French douch bags (I feel). There are just as many gold-diggers. But in general, like I said, Americans are more extreme- so it sticks out more. So there are just as many intellectuals, but they seem to talk about it less. Percentage of personalities seems to be the same. 

One of the things I like about dating in Europe is the work-life balance. I found dating (maybe this is more about relationships) in America to be a lot of consumption or spending time together doing functional things cause work/school/hooby tends to be first priority and tends to take up a lot more time/energy. Here socializing is given equal priority. So you spend time with people doing more than dinner/relax/sex, etc. Like go for bike rides or festivals or plays.(obviously, people do that in America too, but less so- I feel). You don't have to turn something like that into an event cause it's happening all the time, all around you- you just go. In America, these things tend to be a special date out. Almost out of the ordinary. Also, I find dating to be more private in Europe. You are more likley to eat dinner at someone's home than at a restaurant. 

Anyway, I've found myself dating a bunch of Dutch men cause they seem to be more American when it comes to dating.

Going to a club to ""converse for fun"" is like going to a strip club to study the interior.

&gt; or even converse with an agenda slanting towards the carnal. this is in stark contrast to the international or european girls in groups.

I generally find trying to ""converse"" to be the wrong approach if you want to get laid. My goal is to say as little as possible, and let body language and so on do the talking. Especially in a club, once you've opened, for most guys I strongly believe it's a benefit to talk less and focus on presence and physical domination.

You sound very analytical. Stop that. If you are in a club to pick girls up, being analytical is a major barrier. Do whatever it takes to leave logic and reason at the door and focus on emotion and presence. Girls do this. Girls in groups that party can be high powered career women but they'll all act like a bunch of ditsy bimbos because they let their emotions take over and go with the flow.

You won't connect with them in a club if you go there with a completely different purpose and completely different mindset than them - this disconnect is usually big enough in other settings, but in a club it grows massively. It's the reason why you can pull of things like instant makeouts in a club if you're in the right state - even with sober girls.

Going to a club in an analytical state is like going to a football match and judging everything by basketball rules - you'll go away thinking it's the most pathetic football match ever and that the players were all worthless.

The way I've always understood it, in communist rhetoric, communism was always a means to an end, the end being the perfect socialist paradise. 

Socialism, as envisioned by Marx and Engels was, ideally, a system where everyone would share the benefits of industrialization. Workers would do better than in the capitalist system at the time (The Communist Manifesto was published in 1848) because there were more workers than bosses and the majority would rule. Socialism is not a political system, it's a way of distributing goods and services. Communism is a political and economical system, which I've always understood was (as I've said before) a means to an end, where the end is socialism.

Which is why I say European countries aren't socialist, rather than capitalist with a little bit of socialism mixed in.

Here's an account for the Jizya being collected

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jizya#Nineteenth_century

&gt; In 1894 jizya was still being collected in Morocco; an Italian Jew described his experience there:
&gt;
&gt;&gt; The kadi Uwida and the kadi Mawlay Mustafa had mounted their tent today near the Mellah [Jewish ghetto] gate and had summoned the Jews in order to collect from them the poll tax [jizya] which they are obliged to pay the sultan. They had me summoned also. I first inquired whether those who were European-protected subjects had to pay this tax. Having learned that a great many of them had already paid it, I wished to do likewise. After having remitted the amount of the tax to the two officials, I received from the kadi’s guard two blows in the back of the neck. Addressing the kadi and the kaid, I said” ‘Know that I am an Italian protected subject.’ Whereupon the kadi said to his guard: ‘Remove the kerchief covering his head and strike him strongly; he can then go and complain wherever he wants.’ The guards hastily obeyed and struck me once again more violently. This public mistreatment of a European-protected subject demonstrates to all the Arabs that they can, with impunity, mistreat the Jews.

It's not true that it was lower either. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jizya#Criticism

&gt;Orientalist S.D. Goitein writes:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;It was, of course, evident that the tax represented a discrimination and was intended, according to the Koran's own words, to emphasize the inferior status of the non-believers. It seemed, however, that from the economic point of view, it did not constitute a heavy imposition, since it was on a sliding scale, approximately one, two, and four dinars, and thus adjusted to the financial capacity of the taxpayer. This impression proved to be entirely fallacious, for it did not take into consideration the immense extent of poverty and privation experienced by the masses, and in particular their way of living from hand to mouth, their persistent lack of cash, which turned the ""season of the tax"" into one of horror, dread, and misery. The provisions of ancient Islamic law which exempted the indigent, the invalids and the old, were no longer observed in the Geniza period and had been discarded by the Shāfi‘ī School of Law, which prevailed in Egypt, also in theory.[5]
&gt;
&gt; Critics often use Jizya as a way to show discrimination in Islamic law. Jizya supporters argue however that it is fair, as Muslims are obliged to pay Zakat[78] (charitable donations) and in the case of Shia Muslims, the Khums Tax[79] (1/5th of one's earnings).[80] **In practise however, the Jizya levied on non-Muslims was normally far larger than the Zakat tax on Muslims. Some evidence suggests that the Jizya was typically double the Zakat; for example, the Hedaya[81], an Islamic legal text, declared it lawful to require twice as much of a Zimmee [dhimmi] as of a Mussulman [Muslim].""**

Or here

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhimmi#The_jizya_tax

&gt; Although in general dhimmis had to pay higher taxes (despite not having to pay Zakat), Lewis notes there are varying opinions among scholars as to how much of an additional burden this was.[98] According to Norman Stillman: ""Jizya and kharaj were a crushing burden for the non-Muslim peasantry who eked out a bare living in a subsistence economy.""[103] Both agree that ultimately, the additional taxation on non-Muslims was a critical factor that drove many dhimmis to leave their religion and accept Islam

The point about being exempted from military service is a nice spin on the fact that only Muslims were allowed in the army. Handy if the Dhimmis rebelled.

If we applied these rules to Muslims today they'd be banned from the army, have to pay twice as much tax and might be made to wear a special sign.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhimmi#Distinctive_clothing

&gt; For dhimmis to be clearly distinguishable from Muslims in public, Muslim rulers often prohibited dhimmis from wearing certain types of clothing, while forcing them to put on highly distinctive garments, usually of a bright color. The scholars cited the Pact of Umar in which Christians supposedly took an obligation to ""always dress in the same way wherever we may be, and… bind the zunar [wide belt] round our waists"". Al-Nawawi required dhimmis to wear a piece of yellow cloth and a belt, as well as a metallic ring, inside public baths.

We could also prevent them from [driving rather than walking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhimmi#Riding), [marrying non Muslims](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhimmi#Marriage_between_Muslims_and_dhimmis) and even [building houses higher than non Muslims](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhimmi#Dwelling_places) - note ""Sometimes, Muslim rulers issued regulations requiring dhimmis to attach distinctive signs to their houses. In the 9th century, Abbasid caliph al-Mutawakkil ordered dhimmis to nail wooden images of devils to the doors of their homes.""

Instead of course in much of Europe Muslims are a privileged minority - protected from criticism and [more likely to be dependent on state benefits](http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=979). Their status is a far cry from the second class citizenship they inflicted on non Muslims in the so called Islamic golden age. ",,1426452331,0,-1,-1

It seemed strange to me that my nation of Israel however considered itself a ""Jewish State"" and gave preferential status to Jews who immigrated from Europe, even though they have no real claim to Palestine since they and hardly any of their ancestors lived in that land for centuries, and treated Arabs who have been living in the land for generations as third-class citizens.  After my nation kicked out most of the Arabs in what's supposed to be Palestine, we put the remaining in ghettos in the West Bank and Gaza, but of course that wasn't enough.  My nation then decided to allow fanatical Jews, who has no tolerance for other religions and wouldn't even fit in any western secular nation that my nation of Israel portrays itself to be, to settle deep in the occupied territories and show Israel's values in freedom, secularism, and democracy to the Arabs by making these [racist Arab haters](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kem1ajIKv1k) live next door to them.

I don't find the combat slow, more unresponsive.  95% of the time I have ""yellow"" ping.  They also designed so that you can't attempt another action until you've gotten feedback from the server for your previous action.  This makes casting spells unplayable.  After casting a spell you have to wait to see the effects before you can move onto your next skill.  By that time, my spell is already off cooldown and my stamina back to full.  The game flows fine the few times I've manage ""green"" latency.  It's the only time I could chain cast different spells and exhaust my stamina bar.  But seeing as I can't find any info on them planning to have regional servers outside of japan - this is too much a deal breaker for me. 

I'd love to try the game again 6 months down the road and see how it's progressed.   However, I find it unlikely that they would change the UI enough or add server locations in EU and NA.  Controller my character is too cumbersome to even enjoy the positive aspects of this game.

&gt;I just got back from a semester abroad in Europe, and let me tell you, it truly was the most magical, amazing experience of my entire life. The French countryside was like something out of a storybook, the Roman ruins were magnificent, and the men, well, European men are by far the most romantic in the world.

&gt;You American men all think you're so suave and sophisticated. Well, think again! European men make you look like the immature, inexperienced little children you are. They really know how to make a woman feel special over there. Unlike the so-called men here in the States, European men know how to treat a woman right.

&gt;For one thing, European men aren't afraid to come up and talk to you. And they know how to start slow, with a nice cup of Italian espresso or a long walk on some historic street. They know the places you can't find in any tourist guide. They know the whole history of the cities in which they live—who the fountains are named after, who the statues are.

&gt;I remember one unforgettable night in Athens, I sat and listened to a Greek sailor for hours as he told me about the countless men who fought over Helen back in ancient times. Afterward, he told me he loved his homeland even more now that he'd seen it through my eyes. I ask you, would an American man ever say something as deep and beautiful as that?

&gt;European men know the most romantic little cafés and bistros and trattorias, candlelit places where you can be alone and drink the most fantastic wine. They tell you what's on the menu and what you should try. (If it wasn't for a certain young man in Milan, I never would have discovered fusilli a spinaci et scampi.) And the whole time, they're looking deep into your eyes, like you're the only woman on the entire planet. What woman could resist a man like that? Then, after a moonlit stroll along the waterfront and a kiss in the doorway of their artist's loft, you find yourself unable to—well, I'll leave the rest to your imagination.

&gt;I'll never forget my magical semester abroad. One thing's for sure—I'm ruined for American men forever!

In fact, my Italian countrywomen could take me or leave me. But that's just fine, because Rome gets loads of tourist traffic, and American co-eds traveling through Europe are without a doubt the easiest lays in the world.

&gt;Being European gives me a hell of an advantage. I'm not sure why, but there's something about the accent that opens a lot of doors. All you have to do is go up to them, act a little shy and say, ""Whould hyou like to go with me, Signorina, for a café?"" I actually have to thicken up my accent a little, but they never, ever catch on.

&gt;After a cheap coffee, which to them always tastes better than anything they've ever had, because they're in Europe, it's time to walk them. Now, all they know about Rome is what they've read in Let's Go, so you can pretty much just make up a whole bunch of shit. It's fun to see how much they'll swallow: As long as I refer to Italy as ""my homeland"" and other Italians as ""my people,"" they'll believe pretty much anything. I don't know who most of the local statues are, so I tell the muffins they're all great artists and poets and lovers. Once, just for the hell of it, I told a psychology major from the University of Maryland that a public staircase was part of the Spanish Steps, which she'd never even heard of. Another time, I told this blonde from Michigan State that the public library was the Parthenon, and she cooed like I'd just given her a diamond.

&gt;For dinner, I usually take them to some cheap little hole in the wall, someplace deserted where not even the cops eat. American girls think candlelight means ""romance,"" not ""deteriorating public utilities,"" so they just poke their nipples through their J. Crew sweaters and never notice that there's no electricity. Just as well, because Roman restaurants aren't exactly the cleanest. After a bunch of fast-talk about the menu, I get them the special, which is usually some anonymous pasta with spinach and day-old shrimp, and whatever cheap, generic, Pope's-blood chianti's at the bottom of the list.

&gt;By this time, they're usually standing in a slippery little puddle. Going in for the kill, I walk them past one of Rome's famous 2,000-year-old open cesspools. Then, as we open the door to my shitty efficiency, I kiss them on the eyelids so they don't see the roaches, making sure the first thing they see is the strategically positioned artist's easel I bought at some church sale. That's usually all they need to see and, like clockwork, they fall backwards on my bed with their Birkenstocks in the air.

&gt;I mean, they're hardly Italian women, but we have a saying here in Europe: Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?

As an American, I have to say I think this is atypical; no offense but this doesn't represent the American experience very well. In theory you can do it but in practice I think it's severely frowned upon (where I live, anyway) to go on multiple dates at the same time and choose among many suitors simultaneously. I could see this working in NYC, but elsewhere, not so much. 

I've always thought that it was basically expected of me that I was exclusive with the person I went out on the date on, at least at the time of our date(s). If anything, I think the European model would be more friendly to this; there, it's not officially a date, so if you decide not to continue w/it, no hurt feelings. Dating, on the other hand, does create a definite expectation that you're leading up to something, so when there's suddenly no more dates, it's very clear - uncomfortably clear - that you are *rejecting* them (a very American concept, in its way). 

Also, not too much too big a deal of it, but the average redditor choosing among many people to date is also rather atypical. Your story is interesting but I just want to make clear it only applies to 1/100 people.",,1426452375,0,2,2

In Europe, 18 is the minimum driving age, and because of expense (and heavy duty public transportation), many people do NOT own a car at a young age. So, the American ritual of picking up your date (in a car) at her home… and if you're young enough to be still at home, meeting the parents… and many of the other strange customs (a kiss on the doorstep) are virtually non-existent in Europe. It's also why you see a lot of people here saying that ""we meet up at a club or a pub somewhere"". Automobiles have radically altered how Americans ""date"".

It's not advised.

&gt;[""Despite the obviously irrational cruelty of circumcision, the profit incentive in American medical practice is unlikely to allow science or human rights principles to interrupt the highly lucrative American circumcision industry. It is now time for European medical associations loudly to condemn the North American medical community for participating in and profiting from what is by any standard a senseless and barbaric sexual mutilation of innocent children."" ](http://www.tranquility.net/~rwinkel/MGM/primer.html)

[LordVoldemort](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/amn5a/a_little_boy_screams_and_cries_as_he_is_forcibly/c0ictey)  puts forth excellent arguments about the purported health ""benefits"" that come with circumcision.  Attached to the top of that thread is a [graphic video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8212662920114237112) that clearly shows why many consider it to be harmful mutilation.

This was a topic of discussion on [4/21](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/btws1/convince_me_not_to_circumcise_my_child_this_is/).  Additionally, there have been user accounts, like [MrForeskin](http://www.reddit.com/user/MrForeskin) and [LordVoldemort](http://www.reddit.com/user/LordVoldemort) and [subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/againstcircumcision) dedicated to educating people about the problems of circumcision.

in addition to the fact that it IS sexual violence, it is correlated with further [societal violence](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/byrkf/an_interesting_article_on_rape_culture_a_term_i/c0p8ehy)

It was advocated as a cure for [masturbation](http://www.cirp.org/pages/whycirc.html) and by [John Harvey Kellogg](http://www.circumstitions.com/Kellogg.html) as a punishment for the same:

&gt;Covering the organs with a cage has been practiced with entire success. A remedy which is almost always successful in small boys is circumcision, especially when there is any degree of phimosis. **The operation should be performed by a surgeon without administering an anæsthetic, as the brief pain attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon the mind, especially if it be connected with the idea of punishment, as it may well be in some cases.** The soreness which continues for several weeks interrupts the practice, and if it had not previously become too firmly fixed, it may be forgotten and not resumed. If any attempt is made to watch the child, he should be so carefully surrounded by vigilance that he cannot possibly transgress without detection. If he is only partially watched, he soon learns to elude observation, and thus the effect is only to make him cunning in his vice.


HEALTH:

A meta-study of 35 articles on circumcision vs. HIV found that:

&gt;When the raw data are combined, *** a man with a circumcised penis is at greater risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV than a man with a non-circumcised penis *** (odds ratio (OR)=1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.01-1.12). Based on the studies published to date, recommending routine circumcision as a prophylactic measure to prevent HIV infection in Africa, or elsewhere, is scientifically unfounded.  (emphasis mine)

http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/vanhowe4/

&gt;According to the retrospective study of urinary tract infections (UTI's) in US military hospitals which is usually quoted in support of MGM, it requires at least 50 to 100 circumcisions to prevent a single UTI infection

fgc vs mgc:

[this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98f3IavuEgQ) shows the idiocy of separate treatment according to gender.

[part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvX5J7lAv4g) and [part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS1inzYWa0Q) had me laughing with the sarcasm, but provided a lot of references as well.

Some would say that circumcision (MGC, make genital cutting/mutilation) is qualitatively different from FGC (Female genital cutting / mutilation).  That depends on the procedure.    Educate yourself about the female anatomy lest someone convice you that the entire clitoris is removed.

As can be seen at [3dvulva.com*](http://www.3dvulva.com/h_clit1.htm)  the clitoris isn't just the outside 'nub' part, so comparisons to FGC that is said to include ""cutting off the entire clitoris"" are likely inaccurate.  Actually, parts of the clitoris grow behind the [pelvic bone.](http://www.3dvulva.com/h_pelvis3.htm)


*this site shows anatomical drawings of genitalia.

Finally, the accusation that FGM destroys sexual pleasure for a woman is incorrect, if sexual pleasure = orgasm:

In this study, it is shown that the women who had been mutilated / cut / circumcised actually had a higher orgasmic rate than the control (uncut) group:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17970975

&gt;&gt;RESULTS: The group of 137 women, affected by different types of FGM/C, reported orgasm in almost 86%, always 69.23%; 58 mutilated young women reported orgasm in 91.43%, always 8.57%; after defibulation 14 out of 15 infibulated women reported orgasm; the group of 57 infibulated women investigated with the FSFI questionnaire showed significant differences between group of study and an equivalent group of control in desire, arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction with mean scores higher in the group of mutilated women.

Another study has linked [circumcision](http://www.jurology.com/article/S0022-5347%2810%2902988-5) with a 'lower risk' of penile injuries(cuts, abrasions, etc) during sex, and thus concludes that there would be a lower risk of AIDS transmission.   Other factors were lubrication and condom use.  The former cannot be reversed; the latter two can be had.  Additionally, the study was done in Kenya, where [dry sex](http://sti.bmj.com/content/82/5/392.abstract)  (a sexual practice involving the deliberate dessication of the vagina) is a common occurrence.

fgc vs mgc: severity of procedures.   Some will argue that FGC type III involves sewing the labia shut.  This is an emotional argument when divorced from the fact that type III is *not* the most common type of FGC.  It would be like jumping ot a description of [subincision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penile_subincision) in an argument against circumcision as it is most commonly practised in the US.

PAIN:

The data obtained from 184 nursing mothers of neonates show that although 86.93% subjects rated male neonatal circumcision pain as moderate to very severe, [the procedure is performed (95.1%) without pain relief given, during or after.](http://www.nainr.com/article/S1527-3369%2809%2900047-6/abstract)

* We call it human meat, but given the several human species (two counting Neanderthals, maybe three if there was another) around at the time, maybe they didn't count those others as human, hunted them like animals, and ate them? ",,1426452430,0,1,1

And I think that making a difference between talking to a girl and talking to a friend is ultimately not good. Can't I be a girl and a friend and still keep the possibility of the encounter ending with sex opened?

And saying that girls are scary because you want to have sex with them is just not logical. A lot of girls walk among guys that they want to have sex with but I don't think they're scared of them.

I understand that social skills are important, but again, in Europe it's not really a concept that anyone talks about or tries to learn about. But it makes sense what you said, you do need more social skills when you're 1 on 1 with someone new, and maybe the reason why it's not talked about in Europe is because it rarely happens that you're 1 on 1 with someone completely new.

*[Matador](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-gULXGK79U) - From the same local scene, these two play live facing each other, knees interlocked. They play a Polish influenced type of folk music with a guitar and violin that is at the same time haunting and gorgeous.  I suggest that you enjoy those harmonies on youtube in HD.

*[Fire on Fire](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLKKQjELDQo&amp;feature=related) Not the same scene, but kindred spirits from across the country in Maine. These five came out of a post-punk band and are doing a similarly Eastern European influenced acoustic thing that is just powerful.

Why is he a nutcase?  Well, pick one thing at random, Ron Paul's opposition to the FDA.  He acts as if this organization was created by Communists in order to hold the regular man back - but in fact, the FDA was created because American big businesses would regularly poison their customers and the ""free market"" wasn't dealing with this - because it's pretty hard to tell who's making you sick if everyone is selling you bad food.  

In fact, it wasn't the wholesale sickening of American consumers that prompted the creation of the FDA - it was when American food started to be associated with food poisoning in Europe that the government stepped in.

The main article quotes a couple tweets from a tweet conversation Rob Weir was having. The other side of the conversation was not shown, so if you want to see it, you'll have to do some digging. If you do, you'll find that the denigration Weir is complaining about appears to be Berger's tweet about not enough ODF 1.2 features being included in the interoperability test at the event. Considering that the OASIS press release specifically called it a test of ODF 1.2 interoperability, it seems pretty reasonable to want the tests to be about more than 1 ODF 1.2 feature.

Anyone want to explain how that is denigrating the event?

There's also a link in the first paragraph to BN's earlier writings on this matter. The rest of the links are all to prior BN writings on different subjects. So let's follow the link to their prior article on this topic.

That takes us to an article that mostly is going off about the browser ballot in Europe. It eventually does get to the OO event in Budapest. There it tells us that someone at Microsoft has a presentation at that event (citing another Weir tweet). Apparently this is the basis of the ""crashing"" the event claim.

So, here's what we end up with. Microsoft, which has several people on the OASIS ODF TC, has someone giving a presentation at an OO event, and that person also wants to use the 1.2 interop test to test 1.2 features.

If you're writing a book that takes place in another culture, the same idea goes unless there are no gender roles in that world -- but you'll also need to consider the differences between gender in our culture vs. gender in your book's culture. E.g., if your book takes place in an egalitarian space colony, that has been egalitarian for thousands of years, it's likely that women will spend less time on appearances (since they don't need to lure a wealthy husband in order to eat, and don't have a cultural history of women having to do so) and men might even spend more (since they can't rely on income to attract women, and aren't discouraged from prettying up by homophobic cultural norms), to the point where the beauty norms for both might be pretty much the same.

Looking at that chart, it's clear why the economy got a shot in the arm after WW2.
