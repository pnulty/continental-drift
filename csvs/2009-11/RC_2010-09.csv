One of the main beefs secular humanists have with religious people is how they will ignore basic human decency and justify picking on the little guy and justify it with their own self-righteous beliefs and personal hang ups.

Now to go and jump on the hate-band wagon and insult a marginalized group that's currently on the receiving end of nation wide bigotry by labeling their prophet a pedophile for your own smugness and petty sense self-righteousness is just as backwards as any anti-Muslim rhetoric in a church bulletin.

What exactly is your point again?  Blood spewed out of my eyes halfway through that quotation.

&gt;There are more slaves today than at any other time in human history

Numerically.  Not proportionally.  Half of all slaves today seem to be from Asia.  And regions in Africa, like Sudan, have lots of slavery(often along ethno-religious lines, eg muslims enslaving Dinkas and the like).  Eastern European countries like Moldavia also are riddled with human (sex) trafficking.  

I'm curious, did you get the ""There are more slaves today than at any other time in human history"" line from a book called *A Crime So Monstrous*?  If so, then you presumably read the part where Skinner qualifies that he means only numerically, not proportionally?  

I went and looked at your comments' history, to see if I could discover some kind of vague racism, but I didn't find that.  I found something much more confusing.  You've brought this subject (non-Western slavery) up several times.  You seem to be on some kind of strange crusade.  

You say that 'white' people just happened to be the most successful at what everyone had been trying to do ... but isn't that something in itself?  I wouldn't disagree that other cultures besides Europeans would (and some would still like to) do the things Europeans did but Europeans are the ones who actually did it.  I don't know if you're playing up to some cry of 'unfairness' or not, but fair doesn't really matter on this one.  We (peoples of European descent) are part of a heritage that have been performing a series of extraordinarily evils.  If things had turned out different, maybe others would have played that role.  But it's not inconsequential that we're the ones who actually did it.  

Pointing at others and yelling, ""they did it too!  they did it too!"" doesn't justify anything.

No, I have never read that book.  

No, Europeans are not the only ones who did these things. Slavery was on every corner of the earth.  Expansion for gain is as old as history and took place from Asia to Africa to the Native Americans.

Have you not read about Genghis Khan?  You do know that he had the largest land empire in history and conquered, raped and killed many South East Asians, and Europeans?  Youve read about Zulu right?  He killed millions of Africans expanding his empire.  Mayans, Incas, etc who used neighboring tribes as slaves and human sacrifice.  The facts are the West is not the unique perpetrator of *""a series of extraordinarily evils,""*  these evils were performed by every culture and peoples on earth.  Nazi's were bad.  Please read about the Japanese during the same time period...they were just as bad and had the same superior race ideology.  The Roman empire did conquer others...but much after the Persian empire conquered and subjected most of their known world.  The Goths (Germanic tribes) were a ruthless band that smashed through other cultures..,but they never matched the ruthlessness and expansion of the Huns (Turkish tribes).

I dont know if it's White guilt that makes you feel that others could not do this or if its a feeling of White superiority that makes you feel others are not capable of the same acts.  History and human nature say otherwise.

I'm not saying this should be the reason Turkey is kept out of the EU either. The statement about conservative values being found in rural Turkey is more there to illustrate the fact that -in my opinion- there are more differences between secular, modern Turkish people and their rural counterparts than there are between a secular modern Turk and a secular modern Swede or German.

Whether or not Turkey should be in the EU I foist fully on the geographical argument because to do anything else would be the same as pretending I know what does or doesn't make a country European aside from being located west of the Bosphorus, Ural mountains and river and north of the Caucasus, Black and Mediterranean seas.

Since all the aforementioned countries have a substantial portion of their territory and in some cases their population as well, outside of these boundaries I think the argument to include them in the EU based on ""cultural"" grounds would be a bit tenuous since it would open the door to something equally ridiculous like Canada being allowed to join the EU based on its quote-unquote European cultural heritage.

Or if you're more ambitious/adventurous, go somewhere like Asia (I'm partial to Thailand) or down under. Do something fun like ziplines or cooking courses or jump from an airplane.

SAVE. YOUR. MONEY.  London is crazy expensive.  Hopefully you've been doing this already.  Yes, there are bargains to be found, but with the exchange rate/traveling expenses, you want as much money as possible.

RyanAir is your friend.  Cheap, cheap, cheap flights, no-frills airline based in Europe.  Take as much as you can in a small backpack/suitcase and then you won't have to pay to check luggage either!

Get a raincoat.  Yes, it rains a lot there.  I also recommend taking Vitamin D, because the lack of sunlight can get to you (I wish I would have done this--I spent much of my time depressed).

TRAVEL.  Go wherever you can, anytime that you can.  This may be your only chance to travel as much as you want since you don't have a shitload of responsibilities (UK schools are low on homework).  Go to Italy, go to France, go to Germany, wherever!!  Stay in student hostels.  No, it's not like the movie, they're actually (usually) pretty cool.

Explore!  Do the touristy stuff, but also just take time to walk around the city and find what it has to offer!  You can find some of the niftiest things that way.  Stables Market (Camden Market) is a must.

There is almost no homework.  This being said, GO TO YOUR CLASSES.  Majors in UK schools are specialties, not general like in our schools.  If you're taking philosophy classes or something, you might feel behind.  Just go to class, read what they tell you to read, and DO THE ESSAYS EARLY.  I knew so many people who were stuck the last week we were there because they put off writing their 10-page essays to the last minute.

The food is not terrible, despite popular belief.  It's actually pretty good.  That said, cook for yourself much of the time.  This will save you a lot of money.  

Get an Oyster card.  This will be your best friend.  Works on buses and the Tube.

Does anybody know the comparison he's making between the execution of Iraqi hostages and the execution of the Italian prime minister in 1978? I normally steer clear of these videos, but I'm really curios about this comparison.



 Some of my favorite points:

&gt; Evangelical atheists never doubt that human life can be transformed if everyone accepts their view of things, and they are certain that one way of living - their own, suitably embellished - is right for everybody. To be sure, atheism need not be a missionary creed of this kind. It is entirely reasonable to have no religious beliefs, and yet be friendly to religion. It is a funny sort of humanism that condemns an impulse that is peculiarly human. Yet that is what evangelical atheists do when they demonise religion.

. 

&gt;A curious feature of this kind of atheism is that some of its most fervent missionaries are philosophers. Daniel Dennett's Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon claims to sketch a general theory of religion. In fact, it is mostly a polemic against American Christianity. This parochial focus is reflected in Dennett's view of religion, which for him means the belief that some kind of supernatural agency (whose approval believers seek) is needed to explain the way things are in the world. For Dennett, religions are efforts at doing something science does better - they are rudimentary or abortive theories, or else nonsense. ""The proposition that God exists,"" he writes severely, ""is not even a theory."" But religions do not consist of propositions struggling to become theories. The incomprehensibility of the divine is at the heart of Eastern Christianity, while in Orthodox Judaism practice tends to have priority over doctrine. Buddhism has always recognised that in spiritual matters truth is ineffable, as do Sufi traditions in Islam. Hinduism has never defined itself by anything as simplistic as a creed. It is only some western Christian traditions, under the influence of Greek philosophy, which have tried to turn religion into an explanatory theory.

.

&gt;In today's anxiety about religion, it has been forgotten that most of the faith-based violence of the past century was secular in nature. To some extent, this is also true of the current wave of terrorism. Islamism is a patchwork of movements, not all violently jihadist and some strongly opposed to al-Qaida, most of them partly fundamentalist and aiming to recover the lost purity of Islamic traditions, while at the same time taking some of their guiding ideas from radical secular ideology. There is a deal of fashionable talk of Islamo-fascism, and Islamist parties have some features in common with interwar fascist movements, including antisemitism. But Islamists owe as much, if not more, to the far left, and it would be more accurate to describe many of them as Islamo-Leninists. Islamist techniques of terror also have a pedigree in secular revolutionary movements. The executions of hostages in Iraq are copied in exact theatrical detail from European ""revolutionary tribunals"" in the 1970s, such as that staged by the Red Brigades when they murdered the former Italian prime minister Aldo Moro in 1978.

.


&gt;The influence of secular revolutionary movements on terrorism extends well beyond Islamists. In God Is Not Great, Christopher Hitchens notes that, long before Hizbullah and al-Qaida, the Tamil Tigers of Sri Lanka pioneered what he rightly calls ""the disgusting tactic of suicide murder"". He omits to mention that the Tigers are Marxist-Leninists who, while recruiting mainly from the island's Hindu population, reject religion in all its varieties. Tiger suicide bombers do not go to certain death in the belief that they will be rewarded in any postmortem paradise. Nor did the suicide bombers who drove American and French forces out of Lebanon in the 80s, most of whom belonged to organisations of the left such as the Lebanese communist party. These secular terrorists believed they were expediting a historical process from which will come a world better than any that has ever existed. It is a view of things more remote from human realities, and more reliably lethal in its consequences, than most religious myths.",,1426447466,0,12,12

Be careful with this word unless you are sure you are not committing fallacy yourself. If one claims that more than 50% of Jews in Israel originate from Arab countries, a more appropriate question in US would be to ask how many American presidents were white, since whites are a majority in US. How many females were presidents makes sense in any country, and has nothing to do with ethnic/tribal/descent groups in that country.

&gt; Here's a short, incomplete list that serves as a partial answer.

Either this list is very incomplete, or Jews that originated in Arab countries are severely underrepresented. 

&gt; You are aware that the link you just gave there says that there are 3,000,000 Mizrahi Jews in Israel, right?

The article says:

""Together Mizrahi, and Sephardic Jews number over 3,000,000 people in Israel today, with hundreds of thousands more having mixed Ashkenazi herritage due to Jewish cross-cultrual intermarriage.""

I said:

""In any case, about 70% of today's Israelis are born in Israel, which indicates very high immigration, most from Europe/America.""

RusskiJewsski said:

""Again wrong. The fact that 50% of all israelies are the descendants of jews from arab countries proves it.""

Read the article carefully. It does not say that 50% of Jews in Israel come from Arab countries. The 3000000 figure covers all Jews of non-Ashkenazi descent, many from non-Arab countries. Arab != Muslim.

Anyhow, I quoted the article to show that 30% of the Jews living in Israle today are first-generation immigrants, most from Europe. Do you think that the article does not say that? ",,1426447482,0,-1,-1

I see it as a huge problem that SC2 is incredibly popular. Activision already knew from MW2, but now they know for sure that if people want a game and have been anticipating it for a long time, you can fuck them as hard as you want and they'll probably still buy it. Personally, despite Activision removing LAN support, after watching a friend play SC2 I decided I was just going to bite the bullet and buy it. Of course, when I dug a little deeper and found out that SC2 locks you into the region you buy it in, and charges significantly more for the game in Europe and Australasia whether you buy a physical or digital copy, I changed my mind.

There were three things I really loved about Starcraft &amp; WC3 that Activision have ruined. Playing LAN, playing against friends in the U.S. and elsewhere, and playing custom maps, which with SC2 are no longer stored locally and can be denied by Activision for any reason at all.

&gt; However, the big problem that impeded further expansion of this imperial outpost was the supply of fresh water.


&gt; Ascension was an arid island, buffeted by dry trade winds from southern Africa. Devoid of trees at the time of Darwin and Hooker's visits, the little rain that did fall quickly evaporated away.

&gt; Egged on by Darwin, in 1847 Hooker advised the Royal Navy to set in motion an elaborate plan. With the help of Kew Gardens - where Hooker's dad was director - shipments of trees were to be sent to Ascension.

&gt; The idea was breathtakingly simple. Trees would capture more rain, reduce evaporation and create rich loamy soils. The ""cinder"" would become a garden.

&gt; So, beginning in 1850 and continuing year after year, ships started to come. Each deposited a motley assortment of plants from botanical gardens in Europe, South Africa and Argentina.

Europe-Great place to vacation and possibly live but not as rosy as everyone makes it out to be. Very expensive to live, tiny overpriced housing, big brother, no initiative to excel, lack of jobs because employers have fled, etc. 

Taxes-Once you actually start paying more in taxes than you actually consume it will start to piss you off.

Homes-Why should my tax money go to bail out home owners and banks who took risks? Why does the government work so hard in getting people into homes they can't afford. Where is my break for being conservative with my money.

Details please. The US also has a large grid network.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Transmission_Organization

&gt;However, I personally do not support France's policies. I would not want my country to be saturated with the type of nuclear plants they have at all. There is a high chance that the fact that their plants are falling apart at the moment will leave them with disaster that will have a much longer lasting impact than Deepwater Horizon.

Whatever. There is no reason to believe this. French reactors have the same safety features as US reactors.

&gt;Nuclear isn't very flexible in starting up / shutting down. 

And neither are renewables. They are even worse because people have no control over them.

&gt;The reason it works in France is because when they overproduce they can sell off their excess energy to other countries. 

And that is a bad thing? They are helping Germany since renewables are such a failure there.

Also, excess energy can be used in synthetic fuel production, water desalination, and many other industrial processes. Excess energy is unambiguously a good thing.


&gt;France has been willing to take on these things from a policy perspective, which includes the government absorbing a great deal of the cost (including hidden cost) and assumption of all the financial risk by the state and state companies. 

So what? I'm not against government involvement in the economy when private industry cannot deal with certain important thing (e.g. long term research funding, large infrastructure investment like energy and transportation, etc.). The only thing private industry is willing to pay for is fossil fuels, because they are far cheaper than nuclear or renewables (unless one takes into account externalities).

And our energy companies (and all other major corporations) are implicitly backed by the government as well, as fall 2008 proved.

&gt;This is not much different from Denmark's wind power policies, both in advantages and disadvantages. Of course done on a smaller scale for less money.

Which is why Denmark still uses so much coal.

&gt;They also have a huge problem with water supply, when temperatures climb and the water becomes to warm, France suddenly become a mass importer of electricity. This can not be solved by evaporating waste water I'm afraid, which seems to be a very specific solution for that location.

That is not inherent with nuclear power, but is an aspect of thermal power plants, so it applies equally to coal fired plants, natural gas plants, and solar thermal. The French went cheap with their cooling tower designs. There are technologies that can deal with this, as Joe Romm has pointed out for solar thermal (which applies equally well to nuclear).

http://climateprogress.org/2009/04/29/csp-concentrating-solar-power-heller-water-use/

&gt;In a country with the safety record of the US (as illustrated by you) or China, I'd be really terrified if they had the infrastructure that France has today.

Be fair for a second. The fossil industry in the US is private and largely unregulated thanks to industry lobbying. The nuclear industry is heavily regulated and very safe. No one has ever died from commercial nuclear energy in the US.

&gt;As for solar, I think if you want to invest in a ""manhattan"" project, I'd argue investing in a tech where you know you can make gains and have almost guaranteed returns. 

You keep talking about guaranteed returns, but **we don't know that for a fact**. The growth curve could easily end at any time because real growth curves are S-shaped.

&gt;I don't think the goal would be to look at already established industry where there is little hope for big gains.

I'm advocating major changes for the nuclear industry. I do not want them to continue as they have been with large and expensive reactors. I want small, factory-built, mass-produced reactors like mPower and eventually LFTR.

&gt;What you argue for seems to be something similar to France or Denmark, where the government commits to taking responsibility for generating power using a certain mode (for whatever reason, CO2, energy security, etc), and pays the money needed to make that switch. Then either you raise electricity prices to pay for it, or you raise taxes (or you take on more debt).

I believe the private market can do the small nukes just fine. That is the whole point of going small. We will see what happens though in a few years because the mPower, NuScale, and Hyperino are all currently preparing for licensing.

&gt;Honestly I don't think the US is capable of that.

We are capable of it from a technological perspective. This is the country that went to the moon, invented nuclear weapons and nuclear power, invented airplanes, invented the Internet, etc. We just need to stop letting Reaganism on the right and anti-development environmentalism on the left destroy our ability to do great things.

This is pretty much fact nowadays. Vaccines take advantage of this: they contain weakened or dead forms of a disease, but your immune system reacts the same way it would had this been a full blown, real attack. This serves as a training exercise that your immune system learns from, so the next time it encounters this disease it will instantly know what to do, eliminating the intruders so fast you never even show symptoms when invaded the next time.  

In the same way, your immune system learns from natural encounters with bacteria and viruses that happen during everyday life. 

This also explains why many native's were killed by diseases brought over by the Europeans. Things that these foreigners considered minor ailments, such as the common cold, often killed the Native Americans since their immune systems did not know how to deal with these, *puts on sunglasses*, foreign ailments. Genetics also play into this, but much of what is in your genetics comes from generations of immune system experience so it could be theorized that your encounters with bacteria now could give your future generations an advantage in dealing with bacteria and viruses.

This beauty standard was created by years upon years of racism, oppression, hatred and brainwashing. The beauty standard for women is basically pale/light skin, long straight hair, light colored eyes and in some cases light colored hair. Basically an Aryan woman. Throughout the years this standard has trickled down so that it includes not only Aryan women but races which are close enough to this standard (light skin, long straight hair). Asian women and white Hispanics/Latinas fit this mold. I'm aware that Hispanic isn't a race but for the sake of keeping things condensed here...

Not only have these physical traits kept many black women out of the beauty standard, but there are stereotypes zooming around the minds of ignorant white men as well. Not only white men but everyone. But since this topic is addressing white men and black women, I'll talk about them only. Anyway, black women are stereotyped as being loud, boisterous, ""ghetto"", intolerable, uneducated, ignorant, masculine/unfeminine and basically just despicable. I'm sure you can vouch this as truth; it's highly likely you've heard your white male friends speak poorly of black women before. Perhaps you've heard them say things like ""I would never date a black woman"" or ""I'm just ... not attracted to them"" (which I think is either utter bullshit or complete stupidity but whatever).  Meanwhile, in other news, white women are portrayed as being ""feminine"", kind, lovely, intelligent and basically PERFECT. This also includes women who are closer to being/appearing white than a black woman.

All that being said... do you understand now why white men in this country would prefer to date an Asian or light skinned Hispanic/Latina woman over a black woman any day? I'm speaking only of interracial relationships since there are more people dating within their own race than dating outside of their race. A white man would most likely choose a fellow white over any other race, but in the interracial world he's more inclined to choose an Asian or light skinned Hispanic/Latina woman over a black woman, because she's simply too... ugly, primitive and uncultured and such and such for him. 

When it comes to black men and white women, the ""tall, dark and handsome"" standard has also been around for years and supposedly black men are bigger in body size, they are darker than white men, and... handsome? Well that's debatable. 

So who do I blame? I blame society and peoples' BACKWARDS thinking. I blame the media to an extent but there should come a point in someone's life where they realize that the media is not the truth. Just because there are more white women on magazine covers than any other race does not mean they ARE the superior women or they ARE perfect or they ARE the best looking. People need to wake up and smell the coffee, especially Americans. Explore the world! If only people would free their minds from this restrictive backwards mentality MAYBE we would live in a country where race is LESS of an issue when it comes to friendships, romance, marriage and business. I've found in my 20 years on earth that in other countries (not all, but certain countries such as Canada and many European countries) race is not as big of an issue. 

America really needs to catch up with the rest of the world, and in more than just the education department. Morals, belief systems. There needs to be a change, but it won't happen soon. Which is exactly why I'm striving to live elsewhere.

A: Clusters are indistinct from one another if there is not sufficient variance between them. A cluster is not just defined by its internal similarities, but specifically those traits, or combinations of traits, which it does not share with any other group. In a body of informaiton, such as the genome, a very small amount of traits could be shared by one group and not by others, resulting in a fairly superficial clustering. The cluster of  red haired Irishmen as opposed to brunettes, having only this minor variation to distinguish them, does not provide one with sufficient distinction between the two clusters for differentiation to be meaingful, they're all Irishmen. 

B: Never did I say, race = skin color. I said race equals a genetic lineage associated with a particular region. It is a trivial distinction because it is over broad and does not provide one with any meaningful information with which to assess a person's ability, status, and at this point in time, not even their cultural heritage, location of residence, or place of birth.

C: Intelligence and ingenuity are two separate things. White populations are not on the whole determined to be more intelligent than other populations, but due to the competitiveness of their environments, particularly competition between peoples, the much greater amount of cultural and genetic exchange between those groups and with outside groups, conditions which favored longer rearing periods and therefore more education, and the fortuitous accumulation of a body of knowledge, westerners advanced scientifically and technologically ahead of other populations. Conditions in Europe brought about by both environmental and cultural factors made it so that western populations were able to advance more quickly, not that those people were necessarily more intelligent. When conducting studies which control for socio-cultural experience, there is no evidence that white people are smarter than any other group of people. Any apparent discrepancy in intelligence is brought about by sociocultural and economic conditions, not by genetics except in the case of abnormal conditions not known to be more or less prevalent in any population. The fact is that the human species is too young to have much significant variation. 

D:
&gt;Lewontin's argument could be be used to debunk Dog breeds as well (among other sub-classifications of animals).

You clearly don't understand either Lewontin or Edwards. Lewontin's point was that from the fact of a human lineages origin - not dog breeds, as dogs are a different species and have very different variations - one cannot predict that an individual will have any particular trait with much accuracy, Edwards point was that from a sampling of a number of traits one can make an accurate prediction about what general regional lineage the majority of a person's genome comes from. Those two facts are not technically in conflict, that's what Witherspoon demonstrated. This is the case because some traits which are subject to environmental pressures do change and populations reflect that, but the majority of traits do not undergo significant variation where such variation is not called for. This is to say, we're all in the same cluster, exempting a very small percentage of traits which we use to create fairly superficial groupings almost all of which are based on visible traits because our extrinsic form factors are most susceptible to environmental influence as well as social pressures. 

In the case of dogs, human social selection had a dramatic impact beyond environmental conditions as humans bred dogs with specific intentions in mind. In dog species this has resulted in much broader variance into much more distinct clusters, not to mention that dogs were presumably older than humans and already much varied by environment.",,1426448304,0,1,1

One could, at a pinch, argue that the  Molotov/Ribbentrop Pact was an indication of it, but that would be rather tenuous. 

I can't argue that fascism could be brought under the broad banner of collectivism however (although I did try to...).  It is worth noting though that if you look at them as ideologies, communism and fascism are not similar enough to place together.

It is also worth noting that fascism wasn't totally destroyed at the end of the second world war, it remained, albeit weakened as an element of Franco's Spain.

As to the rest, I would have to agree to a degree.  Politically and socially the Cold War shaped the US, in fact it left a greater mark there than anywhere else bar the Soviet Union.

However, I don't think that the two competing ideologies were seen as places to grab ideas from.  If you take the NHS as an example, it was proposed during the Second World War and became a reality shortly after.  Things like unemployment benefit arrived in the UK even earlier (1910?), the idea of state funded low cost housing came even earlier than that in the 1890's.   

Socialism has never been seen as a net negative in large areas of Europe, mainstream political parties have often identified as such (and been elected...). Even communist parties existed and to a degree thrived in Europe during the cold war, whilst the US was enjoying McCarthyism, Europe was trying to balance the needs of a destitute population.  Ignoring socialist concepts was simply not on the agenda.

So yes, the US has managed to talk itself into a hole, it can't look to solutions or ideas from other places due to potential links with socialism (more to avoid the accusation than anything else), quite something of a legacy for Senator McCarthy..

However, as I noted, there were already moves toward socialism in Europe (As well as fascism) before the war, whilst the US still had something of an individualist revolution, not least because of the level of immigration it saw coupled with the image of personal survival and ambition that it projected.  After the second world war, with the US largely untouched and victorious, it was in a unique position.  One it managed to take advantage of to a remarkable degree, the US became an extraordinarily wealthy state, one where even the poorest were rich, one that sold to the world on its terms.  It was an amazing state of affairs and it bred the concept of US exceptionalism.  

So you end up with a population that feels itself to be exceptional and built entirely on the back of individual effort, that faces an existential threat from a communist state, a government that must fund and maintain enthusiasm for the fight against the communists whilst maintaining at least the illusion of supremacy and wealth at all costs. It is not surprising then that people reject socialism and anything that can be associated with it.

Turkey is strictly secular, and on its way to becoming so, we have burned many bridges with the Muslim world. They still don't ""hate"" us, but I wouldn't count on much sympathy for the EU from the Islamic states, for admitting Turkey.

As I stated in another message, yes, we are 98% Muslim, but most of us are [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Muslim) (read under the sub-heading ""Turkey""), and not [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim).

For instance, we have abolished the caliphate (muslim equivalent for papacy). Ottoman emperor held the title of caliph prior to this, and our abolishment of it made the post extinct. There have been other states trying to resurrect it, but it never happened. Even if it did, Turkey would still not recognize the post.

(The Muslim states usually end up fighting with each other when one claims the title of caliph. And by definition there can only be one caliph. Technically it's not really abolished, but its powers are ""transferred and neutralized"". We transfered its powers to our parliament and government. But those powers are limited to Turkey and not the whole Muslim world. Their usage for politics is also a no-no. Strictly regulatory.)

(This is also why we do not recognize the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople (Istanbul) - he is the religious leader of Orthodox christians everywhere, but has no official power in Turkey.)

Compared to other countries, Turkey doesn't come close to their standards of Islam.

Our current administration is (being the ""mild"" islamists they are) trying to re-establish some of those bonds, with varying degrees of success. But our interpretation of Islam stays the same.

This should be made blatantly obvious though: Islam has never had any influence on the law in Turkey, and it still doesn't. That makes calling our attitudes on various matters ""progressive"" kind of wrong, since that implies relativity with respect to Islam. That has never been the case. Not even wedding is governed by religion, islamic weddings are null and void in Turkey, as is any other religious wedding. People are bonded by law, and that is the only way it will be recognized. (Some people refer to this as an atheist/secular marriage)

So, if the EU gets any credit from the Islamic states for admitting us, it'll be because of our other relations with them, not because we're Muslims. We're only superficially regarded as such, if they know their Islam. =)

To solidify things: My mom is a believer, she sometimes prays. That's the only form of worship she commits. She also enjoys gratuitous amounts of bacon.

I can only talk for the history of my country but I think it can explain some of the reasons why Scandinavia and Sweden is so socialist.

But over population, the end of the American civil war and Preemption Act of 1841 which made it possible to buy cheap land started the emigration.

And, just so as you know, the British ""rule"" as you call it ended in 1965 when Ian Smith declared independence, so the real question is ""is life better now for Zimbabwe than it would have been under Ian Smith?"". In other words, the British weren't ruling anymore by the time war broke out.

And let's consider that for a moment: you're saying that civil war is better than what's going on in zimbabwe.

A few facts:
* In 1969, the constitution was modified. The most significant 1969 modification was the formal separation of two electoral rolls by race. The A roll was reserved for Europeans and the B roll for non-Europeans. The Assembly constituencies were reformed so that there were 50 A roll, and 8 B roll seats. In addition, the tribal chiefs were able to elect another 8 members. Effectively, the result was that 270,000 whites had 50 seats and 6 million Africans had 16 seats in the Assembly.

* From August 1964 to December 1974, Robert Mugabe was imprisoned without trial

* By 1975, although officially democratic, the regime had started to lock up even peaceful opponents of white domination

Robert Mugabe is a DIRECT RESULT of Ian Smith's racist rule. 

To answer your question: yes, as bad as it is now, it's better than a civil war and (b) it is most certainly better in the long term for Zimbabwe to have it's racist colonist and colonialist masters removed.

* I have a feeling that there are less thresholds in the USA. If you go to the top, you go to the very top (private islands, jets, mansions in gated communities etc.). And if you go to the bottom, you go to the very bottom (crystal meth, careers in welfare and crime, debt etc.).

As far as the Muslim thing goes, you are really only correct if you are talking about America outside the major cities (in places where there are only white people and some Mexicans). Muslim Americans are on average more educated and have higher incomes than the average American. Anyone I knew who was suspicious of Muslims made exceptions for every Muslim they met in real life. I feel this is the case for most American stereotyped hatred for Muslims.

Lets not forget that there is a good deal of hatred for Muslims in Europe, especially France and Russia. Outlawing head covering in schools or burqas? You aren't going to see that happen in America anytime soon. There hasn't been a single successful Muslim terrorist who came of age in America- I honestly feel we are far more accepting of Muslim individuals than Europe, where all of the 9/11 attackers were able to allow their hatred for the West blossom.

2002-MAR: Nigeria: Safiya Hussaini, 33, was convicted of adultery. She was sentenced to be buried up to her neck in sand and to be stoned to death. However, her sentence was deferred until her 13-month-old daughter has finished nursing. She appealed her conviction. Her cousin, a Mr. Abubakar allegedly confessed to police that he had sex with her three times. However, the judge dismissed the testimony of the three policemen who witnessed Abubakar's confession, because a minimum of four witnesses are required under Sharia law. Hussaini's lawyers claimed that she also could not be convicted because of the four witness rule. The prosecution argued that witnesses were not required in her case; adultery had obviously taken place because she had become pregnant. Her defense team finally argued that, under Islamic law, the interval between conception and birth can be up to seven years! Only two years previous to the birth of her daughter, she was still married to her husband. The lawyers argued that her husband could possibly have been the father. Commenting on the conviction, Aliyu Abubakar Sanyinna, the attorney general of Sokoto State, said: ""Society is injured by her act. The danger is that it will teach other women to do the same thing."" 9 Mansur Ibrahim Said, Dean of the Law Faculty at Dakar University in Sokoto said that adultery is ""an abomination abhorred by God and society because of the example it gives and because it creates bastards to be rejected by society.""   9

The appeals court later reversed the lower court conviction. They ruled that the alleged act had taken place before Sharia law was activated in the province, and adultery became a criminal offence. There was strong international interest in her case. The European Union, the parliament of Italy and many non-governmental organizations, appealed for Safiya to be spared. 10 In 2002-JUL, she married an entertainer in her local village.

1. I've walked past it 100 times, but never went inside, as is with all the cathedrals and churches in Nuremberg. The most interesting thing I saw was the wall outside of the inner-city had bullet marks on it, to look like it held through WWII, but it actually didn't, it was completely destroyed and when rebuilding they intentionally put those marks there (this is what I've heard from a tour guide). Strangest thing was probably dishes made with rabbit or deer (I'm vegetarian), I've heard of people eating these things before, but its quite a delicacy in the area I stayed at. Most beautiful was the Christmas Market on a clear day, since it takes place in front of the Frauenkirche. The Frauenkirche looms behind all these little tents selling food, crafts, christmas-y things.. It was really neat. 
3. Best time of year is Christmas, hands down. I love snow, and I love all the sweets that come out during Christmas time. Lebkuchen, Marzipan, Pfeffernusse! 
4. I was in student housing and had a monthly stipend, so let me give you a perspective of my budget: I paid about 200 euros a month for my dorm, which was a studio, included a stovetop, fridge and a little bathroom. Essentially, I didn't have to share anything with anyone, which was really nice (not that I dont like to share, but I can get a little picky about how I live). After rent, I had 200 euros left over from the Stipend for Groceries. Being vegetarian I could probably buy enough food to last a month on 100, but I always went for organic/natural things, so it cost a little more. As with electricity, As long as you're turning your stuff off, you're not paying more than 20 euros per month in a room the size of mine. Travelling, if planned well ahead of time can be cheap, and there is even a huge carpooling network through Germany that is cheaper than trains. I'd say in most places a car is unneccesary, because public transit is so thorough and affordable. 
5. Most younger Germans and educated older (35/40+) speak English. The only time I've come across a younger German not speaking English at all are immigrants from Eastern Europe.

I'm 18 now and have lived in quite a few different places around the world so I'm a pretty international guy. Because I've moved around quite a bit, I've pretty much been only influenced by American pop culture and media; films (obviously), music, television, fashion but not sports. With that said, I always had this idea that my way of living/lifestyle would be much easier if I lived in America.

I've been to America three times in the last three years: Florida, Boston, New York (in that order). I loved it; I like eating, so food and eating out there was great, service was generally good and not only in restaurants but anywhere you go. I'm aware of the fact that tipping has something to do with it, but I did meet lots of genuinely friendly and polite people.

Now having lived in Europe for the last six and a half years, two of which I attended a largely American populated school, I heard complaints daily about how *shit* Europe is and this and that. Americans complained over the most insignificant things like not being able to find powdered sugar icing ""anywhere in this country"" and so on.

From my experience socializing and interacting with Americans living here (some of them for two, three, four, five years) this isn't entirely correct.

Don't get me wrong, I've made some really close American friends and some less-close ones, and I do not hold these kinds of annoyances against them because like others have said; each individual is different.

I don't agree with your point though, but it is fairly accurarately describing the French view of americans. Though the dressing part could apply to English and Spanish people too.

Also, two points missing IMHO:

- I hate that every american I met asked me why we hate America. That's just plain wrong and a bit fucked up actually, given the treatment French people got around 2003.

- More importantly: I think most Americans don't seem to realize that their government's policies have been *that* fucked up for the whole 20th century. Every time the topic rose with some other Europeans, everyone agreed that American interventionism is the third great crime of the past century.

* Brutalist buildings everywhere, little architecture older than 100 years. 9th century churches are old, anything else is not.

* Complete corporate domination of every aspect of living and dying. And The Colbert Report.

* Driving too much because everything is too far away. They spend so much time driving they even have cup holders in there. Mental.

* Biking everywhere is either impossible due to lack of infrastructure or is reserved for righteous privileged people in spandex who hate you.

* Unnecessary superficial politeness quickly leads to intrusive, shameless drivel about;

1. Food or favorite restaurants, or the different foods they like to talk about while eating food in a restaurant and talking about restaurants and food.

2. Bad TV shows.

3. Fervent ramblings to anyone or nobody about something they did/might do/are doing to make themselves different or interesting.

* Few watchable TV shows, with truly evil commercials every 7 minutes, for 3 minutes. Seriously.

* Big cheap stuff.

* Big cheap people.

* Scary weather events.

* Scary lack of comprehensive social/health programs.

* Scary wealth gap.

* Scary ignorance of the outside world.

* Scary waste.

TL;DR - I'm moving back to Europe in March, after 6 years in purgatory.  Don't ever come to live here. Generally speaking Americans are humorless droids that work too hard and drink too little.

Guilty as charged.  From an economical vs. historical perspective, it made sense.  It was more confusing than it needed to be.

&gt;Not really. The point is that things like the concept of social housing or collective bargaining and unionisation didn't come out of a fully formed ideology (and predate both the October Revolution and Das Kapital, the NHS does indeed come later.).

Wasn't really the point I was trying to make - the point I was making is that it was through exposure to successful examples of socialism that socialist ideas gained traction in Europe, while in the United States a shunning of all similar ideas produced a hypercapitalist society.

&gt;In short, I don't think that we can tie socialist positions and ideas directly to either a Marxist tradition or new political thinking, but rather that industrialisation, war (and in the UK, the breakdown of Empire). I would certainly agree that the US stood clear due to the Cold war, but not that Europe played one side off against the other for ideas.

You can make this statement, but you've offered no successful examples as to why not.  As for me, I'm simply paraphrasing two guys:  [John Lewis Gaddis](http://www.amazon.com/Cold-War-New-History/dp/0143038273/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1283439371&amp;sr=8-1) and [John Lanchester.](http://www.amazon.com/I-O-U-Why-Everyone-Owes-One/dp/1439169861/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1283439391&amp;sr=1-1)",,1426449497,0,1,1

I always shiffer, when I hear or see someone who doens't know where Canada is. There are people like this here as well, but I guess a much lower percentage.

* Many US-Americans tend to be very extreme - in a political sense - but only one sided. I almost never heard of any left-wing  party, demonstrations etc. Compared to european political parties all they have is right-wing. Even the DP would be called extreme right here in Germany.

* Religion seems to be quite a big point - and the crazy ones (everyone who's not able to accept an other persons point of view) make much more noise and seem to get a lot of attention. There are churches of everyone for everyone. I think the right to choose and practice whatever religion you want to is great, but I also think there have be limits, which don't seem to exist.

I've visited at least once every state west of the Mississippi and quite a few east of it (never been to NYC but that's on the list next)... but I've only ever been to Canada. :P I'm 27, so you 'old timers' or whatever can call me out on the age thing.

Here is how I view America:

1. Our politics are corrupt, everyone knows it. We *all* want to fix it, but we can't decide on how to do it because we're too many countries. Imagine taking the UK and Germany and telling them that they had to live under one government. Not under the EU where everyone can negotiate to make things 'acceptable' and where you can generally keep your own laws as is, but under one actual 'that guy speaks for all of us' country. Of course we're not going to accomplish anything - all the 'normal' people want to fix the system but we're so busy fighting among ourselves that all the people in power, who want the system the way it is because it benefits them, have to do is fan the flames of all the factions and keep us bickering like little children. 

2. As a nation, we aren't greedy, but we don't want to be 'told' that we have to help others. When many of us are 'told' that we have to pay a new tax so the bum on the street can get healthcare, we feel like the government is trying to play robin hood, but we know that THEY are the corrupt ones, not us. However, *individuals* here can be very greedy and the system, being as corrupt as it is, is very easy for them to exploit.

3. As a nation, we buy into the propaganda that is fed to us entirely too well. We are still fighting with cold-war attitudes where people think that anything we do to make us more socialist is going to turn us into communist Russia overnight. The majority of us have little understanding (or honestly, much time to think about) the many and vast differences between Socialism and Communism. We also believe that anything that is communist is bad (though china is helping to sway that opinion some. believe it or not, we kinda like china, or maybe that's personal...) 

4. Most of us believe that the bum on the street, and everyone else for that matter, DESERVES to get health care. We just don't like the idea of doing it like everyone else does it. Instead, we have to do it the 'American' way, which translates to 'I-dunno-wtf-we're-going-to-do-but-that-ain't-it' way. Individualism is the primary tenant of our lives. There is nothing more radical that happens in our lives than gaining our 'freedom' (aka a car).

5. Some of us are 'fundamentalist christians' the way that some Muslims are 'fundamentalist muslims', but in general the 'faith' in America is receding, much to the chagrin of everyone who preaches that we'll burn in hell unless we give them our time and money.

6. We watch too much tv. We believe too much of what we watch.

7. We are some of the most caring, kind-hearted, genuinely open people on the planet. I am proud to be one of them. I just wish that we could make this into compelling news. 

8. We're pessimists. That just means we work twice as hard because we *know* something is going to go wrong. Usually we're proved right, usually we're not ready for it despite the extra work.

9. We've by-and-large abdicated our responsibility to further human understanding to other countries because of 'corporate interests', which means we are happy to take the wild-and-crazy stuff that science is doing right now and make it practical, usable, day-to-day stuff. This helps our bottom line, but has done terrible things to the 'soul' of our nation.

10. We all believe that major change is coming. The US cannot continue down the path that it is on. Either liberals (aka 'moderates' to the rest of the world) will push hard enough that it will ease the pressure on the system and things will get better, or the nutcase-far-right-ultra-conservative will capture the attention of just enough of us that things are going to end up in a bloody, bloody mess (aka violence). 

11. Finally, as a nation, we have bought way to far into consumerist culture, as if it is our god-given-right to have that new iPhone. The negative savings rate is what is really killing this country. If you're European, imagine the stress of not having any savings AT ALL, and knowing that if something happens you have to put it on a credit card, except almost all of your credit cards are maxed. Oh yea, and we don't have free health care, so that's DEFINITELY going on the credit card...

I have no idea what I'm supposed to be looking at. Your post said universal health care should only be applied at the state level, then you said ""where every state in America already has a program"". You linked me a site that gives me a bunch of facts about income and health care spending. There is no universal coverage plan.

&gt;Europe has 21 different countires (states) and 19 different health care systems. At least this fosters innovation and competition. If we model our program after Europe, at least we should follow their example where they realize a one-size solution doesn't fit all.

It doesn't foster competition - citizens aren't allowed to freely choose between different EU member health care plans. Health care in Europe is still a national issue. 

&gt;As far as your other comments go, I would rather seek free-market cost containment and quality over anything the government runs. It is no joke that the government is fraught with waste, fraud, and abuse. There is no reason to expect a Federally run health care program to be any different. 

All bureaucracies, including private corporations, have large incidences of fraud, waste, and abuse. I guess you think it's so much bigger in the government because that's a popular thing to say, and because corporations are *way* better at concealing their fraud/waste/abuse because their only stakeholders are shareholders, who only give a fuck about the bottom line. 

&gt;In the very least you shouldn't be surprised to see it eventually go bankrupt , just like the serious concerns about sustainability of current health care trends in Europe...

Give me a fucking break - the US health care system puts them all to shame when it comes to being unsustainable. We spend *much* more per capita, *much* more as a percentage of GDP, and we **still don't have everyone covered**

Perhaps this race-to-the-bottom in terms of teaching quality is the reason why your kids aren't learning shit?  Teachers unions exist so that the brightest minds in the profession do not leave to go onto other careers.

First, I love America. Americans on the other hand...

Seriously though, as many have pointed out, the US is a land of many subcultures, and it's unfair to generalize. Non-Americans are as guilty of generalizing about Americans as we are of their countries.

Major American cities are arguably more heterogeneous than a lot of other major cities around the world. That's where you really see the so-called melting pot. Ideologies dissipate in American cities, which is why they tend to be politically progressive. Towns and rural areas are different. This dynamic - city vs. countryside - is certainly not unique to the US.

The World Cup was a good object lesson in American pluralism. You look at the names on the backs of the shirts of any team, and you basically see one flavor. Spanish shirts had Spanish names on them, Chinese shirts had Chinese names, and so on. The US shirts, on the other hand, had every kind of name imaginable.

There are a lot of religious zealots in the US, but by and large (and compared to almost every country in the world outside of Europe), the US is a secular nation.

Money rules in the US. Consequently, the US believes itself to be a meritocracy, and in many ways that's true. But no where else is a person's identity so directly based on their possessions.

What is really in question is differentiated services.  Can I classify protocols of traffic and schedule them differently?  

I just so happen to be a network design engineer who specializes in quality of service and traffic engineering.  This is my bread and butter... I not only manage the network for the company I work for, but I make recommendations for other Fortune 500 companies on a regular basis.

First, you can't have a non-blocking network on a large scale.  Sure, your home can have a guaranteed 100 mbps per port, but as your network expands, you have to deal with oversubscription.  It's typically cheaper and more technically possible to have lower oversubscription ratios the closer to the edge of the network, and higher amounts of oversubscription closer to the core of the network.

Have established that there is always the possibility for contention for bandwidth, it's important to understand that when there is contention, traffic is queued and then dropped.  It's only possible to queue a limited amount of traffic, based upon the memory allocated to the buffers and the amount of latency the engineer is willing to incur along that hop.  After the queue fills, it is tail dropped.

This behavior is indiscriminate, but its effect on traffic is not equal.  A TCP flow will see a drop and it will scale its window size down and effectively reduce its overall bitrate.  TCP will also rerequest the packet which was dropped (and all subsequent packets).  However, UDP will continue to send its traffic without changing its behavior... but that dropped packet will not be rerequested and typically will affect performance of the application (typically voice and video).

So, if I wish to use a UDP application which can not handle large amounts of dropped packets, it is benefical for me to preserve such traffic and drop TCP traffic instead.  It's even better if I can guarantee such traffic as well as guarantee a low latency path for it.  

Furthermore, there is certain traffic which tends to use large amounts of bandwidth, and can safely be throttled back in times of congestion.  FTP, Backup traffic, database replication, and P2P traffic.  If I can drop this traffic first, I can allow it to burst when there's available bandwidth, but treat it as less than best effort.

By using such techniques I can effectively scale my bandwidth in an efficient manner.  Instead of upgrading my core network due to congestion, I can manage such congestion and delay upgrades.  This saves money since such congestion may only appear periodically.

More to come... gotta leave for now.

continued:

Here are some studies to ponder.  

First, a study in Europe showed that at night nearly 95% of the traffic is peer to peer protocols such as bittorrent.  
http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2007/11/nocturnal-p2p-transmissions-account-for-95-percent-of-internet-bandwidth.ars

Second, Arbor networks, who make products which do netflow analysis for large enterprises and service providers did a study of traffic patterns.  

10 percent of subscribers consume 80 percent of bandwidth.
0.5 percent of subscribers consume about 40 percent of total bandwidth
80 percent of subscribers use less than 10 percent of bandwidth

http://gigaom.com/2008/04/22/shocking-new-facts-about-p2p-and-broadband-usage/

There are a few ways in which a service provider can deal with such traffic.  First they can create a less than best effort class of traffic, sometimes known as scavenger traffic.  In times where bandwidth is plentiful, it can consume as much as is available... but when congestion occurs, it is the first traffic to be dropped.  The second option is to rate limit the traffic to a specified bitrate.... that could be a fair amount like 25% or 50% of the link speed, or it could be as low as 8 kbps to discourage the usage of the protocol.  Third option is to drop the traffic entirely.

Now let's analyze this from a service provider's perspective.  You have invested in a backbone network, and you have to connect to other provider's backbone networks to reach their customers.  Some traffic traverses multiple providers and they have to pay transit charges to traverse the intermediate providers' networks.  They can only stay in business by making a majority of their customers satisfied with their service (competition plays a role as well,  we'll get to this later).  If most of their customers aren't heavy peer to peer users, their best interest is to not allow such traffic to interfere with other traffic.  They also aren't interested (and in some cases able) to upgrade their backbone to higher amounts of bandwidth, given much of the traffic is originated by a very small percentage of users.  

Now let's assume they flat out block the traffic.  Those who uses such protocols tend to be your more savvy users, and they are going to find a way around it.  They will tunnel it, or encrypt it, or change the characteristics to make deep packet inspection more difficult.  Same deal for rate limiting it to super low bitrates... people are going to find a way around it.  So your best option really is to either rate limit it to the point where it won't consume more than a reasonable amount of total traffic, or make it the first traffic to drop in times of congestion.  

Also understand that providers are interested in increasing revenue through new offerings.  If they can sell you dedicated bandwidth for video or voice applications, they increase revenue.  This is more likely to be offered in the enterprise market, as we see more companies allow telecommuting... but we're still a ways away from even this.  It's something that I have asked service providers to offer, and they're not interested at this time... it's too much work at this point.

This is much more likely of a model than the nonsense of tiered access.  

Now for the technical problems with net neutrality.  First... it doesn't exist today.  When people suggest that we need to preserve net neutrality, it's coming out of ignorance.  While most providers don't modify most end user traffic, it's not by legal mandate.  Second, telling service providers that they may not block or modify traffic means that they can not block or modify malicious traffic.  Wait for the first DDoS attack and see how usable your Internet connection is.  Also, a service provider that adjusts TTL or a checksum could be in violation of the law, depending on how it is drafted.  Third, expect providers to treat all traffic equally, and start billing you based upon consumption rather than having a flat rate... those like your grandma who just e-mail, will be able to pay $20 a month and never complain.  But if you like streaming netflix, wait and see how wonderful the equal treatment really is.

So now we get to competition.  One of the chief complaints is that people have no choice.  I'll ignore that most people really do have a choice, DSL vs Cable, and in some instances wireless.  Let's assume there is no choice.  That really stems from the franchising of local providers based upon the utility... be it phone, cable tv, natural gas, electric, etc.  There is no competition allowed.  The cost to enter the market is enormous, unless you can deliver your services via wireless.  

Only in the past 6-12 months did wireless become a true viable option with LTE and 802.16.  The problem is that there is no real unlicensed bands that can take advantage of such technologies.  So as a result, there are limited options for wireless broadband other than the incumbent providers.  Here's where I have to give Obama credit... he has called for the opening up of unlicensed spectrum for wireless Internet access.  The devil will be in the details, but it's definitely a move in the right direction.

It is difficult to say anything about the US without resorting to speaking of ""America"" as the US Government or as a symbol for something (globalization, etc). 

So it's best to start with the facts. The United States in the third largest nation in the world by both land mass area and population. It is continually growing as nations like Ireland and Japan struggle with declining (and aging) populations. Rural parts of the US have been increasingly abandoned in favor of large urban centers for the last 40 years or so. Despite the uncertain economy (and political commentary on the US's role in the crisis notwithstanding), the US still maintains the largest GDP in the world (unless you count the EU). The US was (and probably still is, depending on who you ask) a major ""superpower"" military and political presence in the world for more than half a century. American culture has penetrated almost every corner of the world and has inexorably influenced the flow of history and left its mark on the world.

Now for the editorial: 

I've traveled around the world and worked with people from very different backgrounds, and I have found that Americans are, in general, relatively more interested in other cultures and more maleable about their values. This varies enormously from subculture to subculture, of course, but it is a direct result of the ""immigrant experience"" in the US. I grew up in a rich suburb with gated communities and such, yet I still had friends of Indian, Jewish, Russian and Filipino backgrounds. And this isn't all that uncommon.

The US is a giant clusterfuck in a lot of ways. You can't take all the world's populations and stuff them into crowded urban spaces and expect them to get along. Every historical, racial and ethnic conflict in the world is being relived somewhere in the US. All the political talk about ""Unity"" and ""We stand together!"" belies the fact that we're just an enormously diverse group of people. ""Mainstream"" American culture -- fast food, TV, movies, football, etc. -- serves a very important purpose of giving people a collective experience so they can relate to one another. In some ways, this is effective at maintaining social order and allowing us to exist in harmony, and in some ways it fails by being too homogenizing and dull and boring.

I've lived in the United States my whole life, and have traveled all across the country, from Cali to Florida, Texas to Ohio and everywhere in between.  I've visited a few other countries, talked to many people who grew up in Europe, Russia etc. and have read much about their social systems and other laws that govern them.  Here's my take on my country.

THE GOOD

-Guns.  I think people in Europe are very strange to not want to own guns.  Whether you ban them or not, criminals aren't going to care, because criminals don't abide by the laws.  I'd much rather have equal or superior firepower to someone trying to break into my home, and it blows my mind the some people across the Atlantic feel otherwise.  I've never heard gunfire in the U.S. except at the shooting range, but I know over 20 people that own firearms.  Maybe you guys trust your government more than we do too, but I think it's ingrained in the collective mind of Americans that revolt against the government is a very real thing that has it's place.  Many people here hunt too.  I also like that I can carry a locking folding pocket knife with a 4 inch blade with me everywhere I go.  I use it everyday for cutting up boxes, quartering and peeling apples and other mundane chores, but in the U.K. as I understand it I'd be limited to a non-locking knife with a blade under 3 inches, which is silly.  I've never threatened or harmed anyone with my guns or knives, and would strongly prefer not to.  But I think it's important to own them, just in case.

-Our geography is incredibly diverse for a single country.  You can experience nearly any climate you would want without leaving our country, from the arid deserts of Arizona to the beautiful, rugged mountain country of West Virginia, to the austere, uninhabited parts of Utah and Colorado, along with states like Ohio that have diverse weather throughout the whole year.

-Speaking of States, it's nice that you can choose from so many different climates to live in, but it's also great that the States have such a variety of laws.  This has it's downsides too but the upside is you can move to a state with no income tax, a state where you can legally smoke weed, a state that doesn't require you to put a license plate on both the front and rear of your car, a state that allows open carry of firearms or whatever other law is dear to your heart.  You can live in one of the most densely populated cities in the world, or you can find towns with populations under a couple thousand.

-The People.  Just like anywhere else there are rich assholes, loudmouthed ignorants, airhead girls and everything else, but there are more genuinely friendly people than not based on my travels.  I've encountered some incredible hospitality in a variety of states, and met very many interesting people along the way.  We aren't a people that you can describe with generalizations (Not that I feel any other country is).

-Privacy.  In recent years our rights have been eroded more than I would like, but there is still a strong sense of a right to privacy for the most part.  It seems to be on the decline however, with cameras popping up so fast we're starting to look like the UK in that respect.

-Progress.  We've come a long way for the better from our roots of owning slaves, not letting women vote and so forth.  On other issues, like adhering to our Constitution and our monetary policy, we've done some serious regression.

THE BAD

-The way we use our military, and how much we spend on it.  I'd love to join the forces as I feel I'd be a great soldier, but as I've told Marine recruiters in the past I don't have enough faith in our administration to make that kind of choice.

-Politics.  So corrupt.  It's so hard to find an honest politician, one who represents the people of the United States and not his own savings account.

-The entertainment industry.  I haven't watched TV or listened to radio in a decade and it's one of the best decisions I've ever made.  Sadly, TV is just what you do in this country when you get off work for most people.  It's sad going for a walk through my neighborhood and seeing TV's on in every home.

-Our food.  Fast food and our highly processed, artificial foods in particular.  It can be difficult not to find something without an artificial sweetener linked to cancer and neurological disease, or high fructose corn syrup, or artificial colors and so forth.  Our low quality food is one of the most frustrating aspects of our country, but at least we have better options available.

-Our tax system.  I do not mind paying taxes in general, but I would like to have some say as to where my taxes go towards.  I do not feel like giving 30-40% of my earned income away to the government is getting me what it should.

-For a ""free"" country, there are many things you can't do in certain parts of the country I feel you should be able to.  Smoke weed, drink when you're 18 (You can own guns and join the service, but can't buy a beer?), marry someone of the same sex (I think it's weird and gross, but people should be able to do it if they want), carry a large, locking pocket knife (Some areas like NYC have absurd knife laws), etc.

-Our healthcare system seems to be a joke compared to a lot of European countries.

-The whole illegal immigration issue.  Our country needs to secure it's borders and enforce our immigration laws, not sue states that attempt to do so.  I, and every other American I know, highly values immigrants from any part of the world coming here *legally,* but those who come here illegally and use taxpayer money to use services they don't pay into, we find that highly disrespectful, and we find it very disrespectful with foreigners try to paint us as ignorant racists for preferring immigrants entering our country to follow our immigration laws and attempt to learn the predominate language.

-Americans that try to paint this as a Christian Nation.  Many founding fathers were, and many Americans currently are some type of Christian denomination faith, but this is a Nation of religious freedom and *usually* religious tolerance.  Lately some of us haven't gotten along so well with people of the Islamic faith, but there are certain people of that faith who haven't been giving us a very good impression to be fair.

-Our Federal Reserve.  Too many Americans remain uninformed of our true monetary policy (Thinking ""The government"" prints and controls the money supply, not the Fed) and the great evils it perpetuates.

But what we're talking about here is health care. A product. A service. A necessity by some, but then again a hundred years ago we'd all be considered living better than kings right now, so necessity is a relative term. The question isn't really about health care, now is it? No, it's about what we consider ""fair"" or ""what we expect"". That's what ths really is. Now-a-days we 'expect"" to get stuff from the government. After all in Europe they have it *much better* than in the US. In a way they're *ahead of us* on social issues. When an American sees how Europe has solved what the people are asking for, they describe it in terms of ""compassion"", and basic human ""rights"". The citizens have been sequestered in their post WWII borders and, prior to the EU, have been forced to look inward and rebuild thier war-torn countries in favor of a ""better"" society. Thanks in large part to the US, the military budgets of these countries has been a token amount of their GDP and they've had the ability focus on their own internal affairs. And compared to compared to the US, some countries are even as small as US States in size and population. This is another important point: The countries in Europe have been far more socialized and heavily taxed that their American counterparts for far longer. A thing many American's look back at and say ""I like it, sign me up!"" The problem gets awkward however, when it's noted that America's population has been *flooded* with European immigrants *even to this day*. So you wonder *why* these immigrants are leaving thier ""utopian"" society for the barbaric US? Well I can tell you why because my mother and father emigrated from Europe and wanted a better life in the US. And what people like you are doing is not understanding what that *really* means. It's about *freedom* and *opportunity* and *liberty*. Ultimately it's about liberty, really. You know, when it was so bad in their home countries, the people of Europe fled to better opportunities. Maybe what you should do is pack your bags and say goodbye to your homeland (just like my parents) and start a new course in a foreign land. I'm sure you'll find an elnclave of Americans to commiserate with. My problem is when honest well-intended American's, like yourself, want something that's not in the game plan of the Constitution. For every governme program that finds it's way into your wallet, your habits, your choices, is another crack in the Liberty bell --itself a fitting token to the Liberties that used to ring true are now the sound of hollow dead-metal. So you see, it's not about Health Care. American's are the most generous people on earth and we used to have doctors make house visits. We had charity hospitals.

Thing is, they're not.

If you're convicted, are under 18 or are mentally unfit you don't have the same fundamental rights as everyone else. Children are forced to help in the house, a schizophrenic can be interned against his will if he poses a risk to society and a criminal can be incarcerated.

However, the limits placed on an individual's freedom must be reasonable and in accordance with a transparent and democratic system of law.That's the problem: democratic and reasonable don't always mix. Primarily because what's good for most people isn't always good for the minority.

So, in the US prison is used as punishment. It is popular. Prisons win elections.

Outside the US, in some EU countries, prisoners are treated well and let out early when they no longer pose a risk. Punishment is less important. It is never popular with the man on the street.

EG: The Netherlands is lax. The Netherlands has an extreme right party which scored very well, due to its hard stance on crime.

Apparently you haven't read much Foucault? 

&gt;I hope historians of philosophy will forgive me for saying this, but I believe that Bentham is more important for our society than Kant or Hegel. All our societies should pay homage to him. It was he who programmed, defined, and described in the most exact manner the forms of power in which we live, and who presented a marvelous and celebrated little model of this society of generalized orthopedics- the famous Panopticon, a form of architecture that makes possible a mind-over-mind type of power; a sort of institution that serves equally well, it would seem, for schools, hospitals, prisons, reformatories, poorhouses, and factories. ...
&gt;For Bentham, this marvelous little architectonic ruse could be used by a variety of different sorts of instituions. The Panopticon is the utopia of a society and a type of power that is basically the society we are familiar with at present, a utopia that was actually realized. This type of power can properly be given the name panopticism. We live in a society where Panopticism reigns.

&gt;Panopticism is a form of power that rests not on the inquiry but on something completely different, which I will call the ""examination."" The inquiry was a procedure by which, in judicial practice, people tried to find out what had happened. It was a matter of reactualizing a past event through testimony presented by persons who, for one reason or another, because of their general knowledge, or because they were present at the event, were considered apt to know.

&gt;With panopticism, something altogether different would come into being; there would no longer be inquiry, but supervision and examination. It was no longer a matter of reconstituting an event, but something-or, rather, someone- who needed total, uninterrupted supervision. A constant supervision of individuals by someone who exercised power over them-schoolteacher, foreman, physician, psychiatrist, prison warden- and who, so long as he exercised power, had the possibility of both supervising and constituting a knowledge concerning those he supervised. A knowledge that now was no longer about determining whether or not something had occurred; rather, it was about whether an individual was behaving as he should, in accordance with the rule or not, and whether he was progressing or not. The new knowledge was no longer organized around the questions: ""Was this done? Who did it?"" It was organized in terms of presence and absence, of existence and nonexistence; it was organized around the norm, in terms of what was normal or not, correct or not, in terms of what one must do or not do.

And, later, in the same lecture series:

&gt;Panopticism is one of the characteristic traits of our society. It's a type of power that is applied to individuals in the form of continuous individual supervision, in the form of control, punishment, and compensation, and in the form of correction, that is, the molding and transformation of individuals in terms of certain norms. The threefold aspect of panopticism- supervision, control, correction- seems to be a fundamental and characteristic dimension of the power relations that exist in our society.

&gt;In a society like feudal society, one doesn't find anything similar to panopticism. That doesn't mean that in a society of a feudal type or in the European societies of the seventeenth century, there weren't any agencies of social control, punishment, and compensation. Yet the way these were distributed was completely different from the way they came to be established at the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth. Today we live in a society programmed basically by Bentham, a panoptic society, a society where panopticism reigns.

While I can't speak for Europe, here in Australia generally the criminals that can obtain guns are the big ones, organised crime, bikie gangs etc. The sort of people who break into houses, hold up corner stores and so on aren't all that likely to be able to get hold of a gun because they are a rarity. We aren't all that likely to get shot by a drugged up loser who wants to steal $50.

This is obviously another big problem we have here in Australia... the way I see it is we're only looked down upon for taking the country because it was so recent. Most European (and even some Asian) countries have been invaded so many times you can hardly tell who the original people were. As for the treatment of the native inhabitants we are probably not as bad as in the past but probably not so different. When the Romans invaded England they murdered heaps of people then set up infrastructure which the English ""barbarians"" didn't understand at the time (there has been evidence of Roman era houses with central heating which didn't re-emerge in England for some time after the Romans left).

In my opinion, so long as I get better, I don't really care about how 'high' the standards are.

Granted, I wasn't seriously ill, but everybody was supportive, reassuring and they had everything they needed to fix me up. I don't really see how it could have been better, besides perhaps less of a wait (waited 1 and a half hours in the waiting room).

The entire country of Germany is smaller than some states. Of course no one can name the states in Germany other than Germans! Geographically speaking the difference in being from Seattle and New York is like being from Munich and Baghdad. It's laughable that this is even a comparison.

1. The housing market has its segmentation.  I suppose the scenario you mentioned may happen on the lower side of the market where even if the property lost 100%, we are talking in the sub 100K prices.  On the higher end, the principal loss (or bank loss) is much higher and the incentive to keep it on te market bigger.  If you average the market, the higher end crash has a much bigger macro-economical impact than the low-end.

2. It is a demand for products and services issue.  Low demand will make companies top-line crash and we will have more unemployed.

3. The banks are in the business of risk-management.  Given the possibility of item 2 above, their behavior is rational.

4. Except Germany which has a manufacturing base and is/was an-export driven economy, not a lot of bright lights (economically-speaking) there.  There is a limit what the Germans will put up with the other EU members (specifically the ones they call ""Club Med"")

Sorry, but if you bothered to read the previous post, you'd see why we aren't disillusioned. I'm 23, and I originally thought I was a Republican as well. Just like was mentioned earlier, self-sufficiency, the ""American Dream"", all that bullshit rhetoric. Guess what. Private Timeshifter, reporting for duty. Thank god that's all done with; I'm a programmer now, doing relatively well for myself compared to where I used to be. Regardless, the fact remains: In the past 30 years at *absolute minimum*, the GOP has made a habit of saying ""We believe in the American Dream"", while conveniently excluding the ""...but only if you're already filthy fucking rich and couldn't possibly use any more money"" part of it. Forget about what the GOP *says*, look at what the GOP *does*: Most of us are intelligent people willing to work for a living, scraping to get by. What part of the ""American Dream"" does that sound like to you? It sure as hell isn't mine.

&gt;I know I appear as some young entitled knucklehead with no real world experience

As mentioned, I'm 23, and yes, you very much do. Many European countries have proven that what we're so goddamn afraid of actually *works*. Go ahead, call me a socialist. I'll agree with you. If you think socialism is evil, you must also think the highway system is evil, Medicare is evil, education is evil, *social* security is evil, and the blessed Armed Forces are evil. Socialism *works*, and it's been proven many times. A truly free market doesn't, and it never will, as long as people remain as they are today: self-serving, greedy, willing to screw others to get what they perceive to be an advantage. Yes, this is a broad generalization. But look who's rich right now. Mostly people who have in some way, shape, or form, screwed someone else over *big time.* If you're in charge of a gas company, you can sleep soundly at night knowing you're screwing over the entire country, if not the entire planet, by absolutely refusing to let any money get put into alternative energy.

Regulate the free market: if a company is too big to fail, it's too big to exist. Socialize basic human needs: if I'm paying into a health care system, *by definition*, you can't deny me from being seen or treated. Get rid of this goddamn genetic engineering for food stocks: we've survived for thousands of years off of what the earth has produced, and in the past 100, we've become a country full of fat, lazy, unhealthy fucks, because ""bad food is cheaper"". No. Good food has been growing for millenia. I don't want corn in my apple, Monsantu. Oh yeah, and you've created an economy almost dependant on high fructose corn syrup... which is *horrible* for a person's health, and 110% unnecessary. The free market's freedom has resulted in almost every conceivable aspect of our economy being run by a select few individuals, who are *always* doing it because it's profitable, not because it's good for humanity. As long as this is allowed, the free market will not work. We've long since proven, wealth does not, nor will it ever, ""trickle down"". It always goes up. What happens when all the money goes up?

I agree that selling council housing was a terrible move that applied a quick fix of cash without much longterm outlook but you have to remember the people living in council houses at the time loved it.  2 million council tenants bought their homes at a discounted rate.  It was so popular that Labour refused to even contest it in the next election because it was seen as a vote loser.  The real problem was that not enough low market homes were built to replace them and councils didn't reinvest.

*Getting rid of free milk to children:* 

The school milk act was passed in post-War Britain in 1946 when there was still rationing. Children under 7 still got milk.  Children whose parents couldn't afford milk and were on benefit assistance, still got milk.  Adults in their 30s and 40s today don't walk around with bandy legs: they didn't suffer malnutrition or calcium deficiency.  Welfare, however little, was still available to the poorest to the extent that no-one had to starve.

*Privitisation of every bloody thing she could think of:*  

I agree although some of it had to be done after Callaghan.  Britain effectively went to Cash Converters and sold the family heirlooms.  In the long term it cost a lot but in the short term it was like running two cars when you couldn't afford to even put food on the table.  Something had to go.  British Airways, Rover, Rolls Royce: yes.  British Petroleum, National Freight, Royal Ordnance: no, no, no.  Big mistakes.  The controversial?  Shipyards and the coal pits: YES.  It turned a dying resource that wasn't competitive into the most efficient system.  The pits that remained open were made to be the most efficient in Europe and the operation on the scale it was was never going to be sustainable.  Then again deregulation, privatisation and the shedding of the Post Office under Labour is as big a mistake as British Petroleum was under Thatcher.  Brown went wholesale too.  Cameron is going to have to as well.  So not everything was privatised because they're still finding stuff.

*Her exemplary handling of the miner's strike:*  

That *was* actually exemplary.  It addressed the disproportionate lobbying power of the unions which could bring down governments and really harm the country.  She prevented power-cuts by ordering power stations to stockpile and she turned one of the least efficient outfits into one of the most profitable; she did it all just as people were going to stop using coal and start embracing cleaner and more developed technologies.  And she did it with a profit.  Controversial and not how it's remembered, I know, - but you have to remember that even at the time the majority of people actually empathised with the government, the pit bosses and not the pit miners and their unions.

*POLL TAX:*  

Awful isn't it.  And then they just renamed it Council Tax and every government since has supported it.  In fact, they've increased it year on year.

We surrendered pretty much without a fight and we cooperated with the Germans to the extent of providing them with a large part of their agricultural supplies. The ""cooperation""-government also approved a Danish SS-corps, Frikorps Danmark, in which 8,000 Danes served out of which half were KIA. 

A few hundred resistance fighters died during the occupation and about 1200 sailors in Allied service were lost too. Unfortunately our record is one of actually losing more Danes who served with the Axis forces than with the resistance or Allied forces. 

However, it is only within the last decades that this story has been told. Up till then a mythical picture of the Danish resistance fighter had been portrayed as what Denmark was during the war. Nobody wanted to face the uncomfortable truth, not least the politicians who had agreed to cooperating with the Germans.

If the general strike in August of 1943 against the German occupation hadn't happened, in which the cooperation-government resigned and the Germans assumed full control, we might have been labelled an Axis puppet and not an occupied country. 

On the plus side we saved all our Jews, including a bunch of my ancestors.

Finally, it should be noted that the Danish cooperation-policy did not come about because the Danes loved Germans or were sympathetic towards Nazism. There was a clear pro-Allied sentiment in the population since the Germans had been the enemy since the wars of 1848-51 and 1864. Furthermore, democratic sentiment in Denmark was very strong and the Nazi party never got more than a few percent of the votes. The argument for the cooperation-policy was that Denmark could not defend itself and might as well save itself from unnecessary destruction. Furthermore at the time in 1940 everyone was convinced that Germany would win the war (I remember my grandfather saying this too), so you had to make the best out of being in a Germany-dominated Europe. By choosing to cooperate the Danish government was allowed to retain control, Danish laws would apply (which also meant that resistance fighters weren't executed) and Danish police would continue to function.

If you're interested in reading more there's a Danish site about military history which also have English sections: http://milhist.dk/start/uk_occupation.htm

P.S. The reason your Danish acquintances probably didn't say anything is likely that their families didn't do anything during the war. That is the case for most Danes who sat out the war. Very few joined the resistance. And they couldn't have been conscripted to the SS since that was voluntary. However, they might have been conscripted to labour duty in Germany, which many Danes were forced to or chose if they couldn't get work at home.

P.P.S. Fun fact: One of my friend's grandfather served in the Danish SS corps while my own grandfather, as a Jew, was hiding from the Germans and eventually had his family evacuated to Sweden. And now their grandsons are best of pals.",,1426451057,0,1,1

Here, I will illustrate how the detail you omit undermines your conclusion.

When you state that ""climate change has always been occuring in the past,"" you omit the important detail describing *on what timescale* climate change has been occuring. With the exception of catastrophic events such as asteroid impacts, cycles in climate line up nearly perfectly with variation in the Earth's orbit known as **Milankovitch Cycles**. There are three variations which are important:
* eccentricity (is the Earth's orbit around the Sun more circular, which tends to enhance interseasonal variability, or circular, which tends to reduce it); 
* obliquity, or axial tilt (evens out the differences between insolation in the north and south hemispheres during opposing seasons); and
* precession, or the wobble of the axis of rotation (alternates which season it is in each hemisphere, relative to the Earth's distance to the sun in its orbit).

The time scale of these orbital variations is very, very large. The shortest variation operates on about a 22,000 year time scale while the largest two operate on 100- and 400 thousand year time scales. 

Human civilization has flourished in an inter-glacial period which began around 20,000 years ago. Modern agriculture has indeed thrived in a slowly warming climate. But that agriculture is relatively young - maybe 10,000 years ago, with a large emphasis on important developments less than 3,000 years ago. In the eyes of a climatologist or a geologist, the period in which human agriculture has existed is a mere snapshot of time. The climate really hasn't changed since agriculture was invented.

However, there have been short periods of relatively colder or relatively warmer weather in the past 3,000 years which have *dramatically* altered human population patterns because they had such catastrophic impacts on agriculture. Some are positive, such as the Vikings settling the New World. Some are negative, such as the warm period in medieval Europe which helped facilitate (along with other factors) the spread of disease.

Now, consider the second premise you present, ""that climate change is occuring now."" The logic in your argument makes a large assumption - that the current climate change is intrinsically similar to climate change in the past. This is false. As I noted previously, the climate change you're referring to in the past is slow and steady, occuring over 100,000 years. The climate change we're experiencing now is radically different, occuring in 150 years. 

This is problematic, and complicates the problem. Climate is essentially an equilibrium position of the atmosphere. If you stress the atmospheric system, it might deviate in large ways (e.g. this summer's heat wave in Russia and floods in Pakistan), but its behavior is relatively confined to an expected range of values. Over time, the precise equilibrium state of the atmosphere changes, with respect to temperature, storm tracks -&gt; precipitation patterns, ocean temperatures, etc. On geological time scales (read - past climate change), this occurs very slowly. In modern times, however, we're stressing the climate system far more vigorously. 

Herein lies the problem. If the equilibrium state of climate drifts slowly, it's rather easy to predict the range of variability you'd expect from it. But if it changes rapidly, things are much more complicated, because the  variability changes rapidly as well. Your conclusion presents a false dichotomoy; we're not choosing between a moderate warming trend or a cooling trend. Under the influence of anthropogenic GHG emissions, we're inducing a rapid (read - Andy Roddick-serve-fast) warming trend, versus the expected gentle, multi-millenium warming trend.

The stresses of this rapid warming trend are hard to explain to a non-atmospheric scientist. But suffice it to say that warming is the least of our concerns. The real concerns lie in the way the atmosphere's general circulation responds to these stresses. This leads to all sorts of disparate regional change. There is evidence that agriculture would be dramatically affected in various parts of the world, ranging from too much precipitation altering what crops are viable, to too little precipitation making agriculture all but impossible. This would stress human populations - particularly in the third world, where even minor shocks to the agricultural systems would not be survivable and would lead to the displacement of millions of impoverished people. But it would also stress the first world, and require a great deal of money to deal with; what would happen if warming temperatures and reduced annual precipitation induced a long-term Dust Bowl event in the Great Plains? There are some studies that have suggested that this would be a prominent regional effect of climate change, were the world 2 deg.F warmer by 2100 (a likely scenario at this point). 

In summer, (**TL;DR**), the premises of your argument do not reflect the current situation, and on top of that, you present a false dichotomy of choices in your conclusion. The correct choice is, instead, to reduce GHG emissions and limit the amount of warming/climate change.

On #1 -- I will shut up now, because I don't know enough about real estate.  What's really fun, though, is watching house prices in desirable urban areas, where price levels have basically gone ""huh?  What?  We're in a what?"" if that, even while everything in the suburbs and some other cities was going to hell...

for #2 -- that was a term I made up.  Essentially, no matter what happens, there is always a level of commerce that takes place, regardless of how few people are buying yachts, watches, restaurant dinners, what-have-you -- that is what I meant with my examples in the original post.  Even in post-crash Argentina, when many people resorted to barter and unemployment/inflation reached catastrophic levels, people still buy certain goods and services.  

I firmly believe that even the US economy is fundamentally robust enough to maintain a level of this that is sufficient to base a slow-but-solid recovery on; ideally, this would be part of a rebalancing (since I imagine we agree that US consumer spending was very very severely out of whack before the crash.)

On 3 -- I agree thoroughly.  Thing is, I think we're talking about 2 different things -- in the US and some European countries, many people are having trouble obtaining loans who are _not_ high risk borrowers.  In fact, these are about as AAA-grade debtors as a bank is likely to get -- for example, property holders with paid-off houses and fully rented-out buildings to use as collateral, competitive business owners with full order books in growth industries, etc.

According to Wikipedia, 4.3 million civilians were killed during Vietnam and even if the US was basically stepping into a civil war... it certainly propagated the decimation of the country.

As an American, looking back at the past fifty years makes me uneasy about my country. I don't consider myself a libertarian (at all), but the best thing the US seems to have done in the past fifty years is have its citizens buy stuff from third world countries and accelerate their rise from poverty. Interference in the Balkans was good too, but it was pursued with less energy than the US's non-humanitarian wars.

In the past fifty years there have been very few (non-civil) wars that haven't been instigated by the US or the USSR. They are the Iran-Iraq War, the various Israeli war, and two wars in the Congo.

And the US was involved indirectly in the first two.

Then you have the war in Afghanistan (1 million civilians dead, according to Wikipedia) and the Chechnyan conflict, which may or may not be a civil war depending on how you slice it.

Then there's the US, getting involved in Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq for its major wars. But there's also a long list of dictators propped and democracies toppled, plus a failure for the world's most powerful military to intervene in post-Cold War genocide except in one small (European) part of the world.

Really the only consolation I draw is that the US is less rapacious than Europe was in the 19th century or than history indicates Stalin's USSR or Mao's China would have been otherwise. Or Hitler's Germany or Imperial Japan.

So I feel like the US was the least bad possibility, which isn't very encouraging.

I'm conflicted about it. It was a war, but a dead person is still a dead person, and 40 million dead people are still 40 million dead people. The Battle of the Somme had a million casualties accrue over ten miles of land. If the generals in charge weren't war criminals, they were at the least barbarians.

It's genuinely appreciated.  

I'd agree that there's definitely not a lot of really strong links between Luther's anti-semitism and the Nazis.  I tend to side with the people who posit that Luther's anti-semitism was mostly brought up after the fact to lend populist credibility to the Nazi's racial theories, similar to the way Hitler and a lot of other Nazi leaders spoke fondly of Christianity in public but were often critical of it at best in private and downright loathed it at worst.  I also think the idea that Lutheran anti-semitism was something deeply embedded in German culture and history is also not very well-founded.  Up until the Nazis took power Germany, while surely having anti-semitism in its society, was generally thought to be one of the more enlightened and tolerant European countries.  It certainly didn't have the same problems with anti-semitic pogroms and scapegoating as much of Eastern Europe, Spain, or even France, so that connection seems a bit tenuous to me.

I think this also ties into Nazism being more of a secular movement than a religious one, which is another disagreement I have with the thread title.  But it's not really an argument I feel is useful or worth having, as a guy in a past topic like this said, atheists and religious people both need to stop playing ""pass the Nazi.""",,1426451266,0,0,0

Population size means absolutely nothing.

""Interest in soccer"" is irrelevant. How do you gauge interest? Brazil's Série A has an average stadium attendance that is smaller than of most MLS teams. A lot more people watch and follow football in England than Uruguay. Does interest relate to more people playing it? Yes, but there is no guarantee they will be any sort of decent.

Wealth and health is absolutely irrelevant too. It's even more irrelevant when one cites countries like China or Turkey (or even India) where the greatest parcel of that wealth is taken by a superior cast of society that will never play a single game of soccer. Economic growth in developing countries *very rarely* translate into greater personal financial wealth at the bottom level. There is also no correlation between wealth and soccer ability either: Ivory Coast fields better teams than European counterparts.

What about the US and European media, do you feel the same about them?  I really can't agree.   

&gt;Israel knows damn well it's being watched very closely.  But for some reason, people still accuse them of being outright criminals with murderous intent.

You imply that since Israel is aware that it is being watched closely, it would never act criminally or with murderous intent.   But seriously when has Israel ever cared what the world thinks?   There is evidence that the murder of the people on the flotilla was planned in advance, but admittedly not all the facts are known, in large part because the Israelis have confiscated most of the physical evidence.  As for other acts of murderous intent, planned long in advance, and supposedly justified out of a need for 'self-defense', there are myriad examples.   E.g., the murder of several hundred Palestinian policemen on the first day of Cast Lead. ""At least 230 Palestinians were killed and more than 700 injured on the first day of air strikes. Civilians, including children, were among the casualties.  Human rights groups critically note that the attacks began around the time children were leaving school.""  That's from [Wikipedia](http://www.imemc.org/article/59294).  I would add that the attack on the policemen was timed to coincide with a graduation ceremony, so that they would be all outside and therefore easier targets.  [Does Israel's care what the world thinks?](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=Israel+%22who+cares+what+the+world+thinks%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;pbx=1&amp;fp=1&amp;cad=b)

There are 3 issues that always interested me. 

a) The sun schedule. If I'm not mistaken, certain parts of Sweden get no more than 3 hours of sun during winter. Is this a big concern or just a natural part of life? Do you adjust your social/work schedule based on how much sun you'll have on a certain season? In Argentina, we are quite ""outdoor"" people. We do lots of outdoor activities (sports, barbecues, sightseeing). I'm assuming indoor activities are more commonplace over there. Is that so? Also, how predominant is the night life (pubs/discos/etc.) given that nights are so long?

b) I've heard tons of things about Jantelagen and how it's a very real thing in Sweden. I have to say I feel it's a very interesting behaviour and in general I find it positive. But, how do you, as a society, react towards someone who's naturally gifted for any particular activity/task? Are, for example, boys/girls with high IQ hindered in their learning ny the educative system  in order to be more like the other kids? Maybe what I'm saying is: According to Jantelagen is it frown upon to be better than other persons in any particular activity? Or is it ok/acceptable as long as you don't make a big deal out of it? Where is it more notorious?

c) This might be indirectly connected with the previous item, but how self aware are you about your position in the world as one of those countries ""everyone would like to live in""? I mean, having lived all your life there, you'd probably say ""ehh, it's no big deal, we have our pros and cons"" but, are you aware of how different society is as a whole when compared to: 1) Other non-nordic European countries? 2) USA? 3) The rest of the world in general?... I come from a country where the law in business/relationships is survival of the fittest. People are constantly trying to step over other people's heads to get a promotion, to steal such person's boyfriend/girlfriend, to fall in someone's favor, and the ultimate goal here for most people is to find the way to get money without working. Nepotism is VERY common, specially in governmental positions, police is easy to bribe, we can't leave anything unattended nor any door (car or house) unlocked because if someone notices, it's a matter of time until someone breaks in, and here we have an interesting point. It's not that it's full of thieves, people won't probably bother to rob a locked car or house, but some of them will seize the opportunity if given the chance. Greatest examples of this are, for example, when you pay to a cashier and he/she gives you more change than he/she had to, 90% of people will just shut up and take the extra change (unless the difference is too big, which will trigger guilt on most people). Same if you're walking and, say, you drop some cash. If someone's behind you, it's not too much cash and they're pretty positive no one's looking, they'll probably keep it. Petty things, but lots of them. What are the social things that upset you about your city/country?

Those are a lot of questions! So to wrap up, a few loose questions:
Would you say swedish people are less friendly than the average european? 

Would you say you and/or your group of friends/acquaintances are more or less friendly than the average swedish person?

What's your opinion on having ~10% immigrant population?

I guess this is a good start! Feel free to answer the ones you like, no need to answer them all, but those are the things that interest me the most about Sweden right now.

Statistically it would be easier to select 11 good players out of 1 billion than it would 1 million, but the difference is the quality of those players is not proportional to the population size. There are more footballers in China than Costa Rica, but if you take random 11 players the probability is that the Costa Ricans ones will be much better.

Population irrelevant? Let's look at the top 5 of the FIFA Rankings:

* Spain: 46 Million
* Netherlands: 15 Million
* Brazil: 192 Million
* Argentina: 40 Million
* Germany: 82 Million

And now the bottom 5:

* Papua New Guinea: 7 Million
* Central African Republic: 4 Million
* American Samoa: 66 Thousand
* Montserrat: 4 Thousand
* Anguilla: 14 Thousand

Of course a big population does not guarantee lots of great footballers, but it definitely increases the changes. That's why a country with &lt; 1 Million inhabitants has almost 0% of ever winning the world cup.

&gt; ""Interest in soccer"" is irrelevant. How do you gauge interest? Brazil's Série A has an average stadium attendance that is smaller than of most MLS teams. A lot more people watch and follow football in England than Uruguay. Does interest relate to more people playing it? Yes, but there is no guarantee they will be any sort of decent.

Interest is irrelevant because you don't know how to gauge it? that doesn't make much sense.

&gt; Wealth and health is absolutely irrelevant too. It's even more irrelevant when one cites countries like China or Turkey (or even India) where the greatest parcel of that wealth is taken by a superior cast of society that will never play a single game of soccer. Economic growth in developing countries very rarely translate into greater personal financial wealth at the bottom level. There is also no correlation between wealth and soccer ability either: Ivory Coast fields better teams than European counterparts.

I would like to see a scatter plot of FIFA Ranking vs GDP before i decide of there is a correlation or not. I think there would be a correlation, with some exceptions of course.

Wealthy businessmen have tried to suppress technology in the past, and it has never worked. Edison tried to monopolize the motion picture industry and his methods involved a lot of dirty moves that would be impossible under modern laws. He ended up bankrupting his own movie studio! He tried to bury competing phonograph technologies as well and that also backfired. American cell phone companies tried to bury the GSM system; now you're all getting either GSM or 3GSM phones. American banks tried to bury the Interac system. You now have Interac at all your bank machines, although you still don't have debit cards (what you have is actually a prepaid credit card disguised as a debit card). 

Companies that manufacture pesticides are trying to suppress Genetically Modified Crops that would make their own pesticides obsolete. This is why there are so many posts on Reddit slandering Monsanto. Germany has banned their GMO corn, and Haitian farmers were persuaded to burn seed stock that was given to them for free as part of an international effort to rebuild Haiti's agricultural sector. Ultimately, people will snap out of the conspiracy theories and realize that the environment benefits tremendously from crops that don't need to be doused with poison every few months. 

As you can see, the tactics are changing. Laws won't allow the sort of dirty tricks that Edison tried to use to suppress his competitors' inventions: registering American patents for things invented and patented in Europe, filing frivolous patent lawsuits to drain their legal budgets, creating moral outrage to suppress European films, and so on. But these days they've learned that Greenwashing works miracles, and bypasses every legal boundary. The quasi-environmentalist wording and pseudoscientific illogic of the ""natural"" movement makes it practically impossible to fight against claims made by green-washers. This has made libel viable as a marketing tactic. 

Curiously, there is a small kernel of truth to the idea that somebody suppressed electric cars, but it goes way back. There was a time when electric cars performed almost as well as gasoline cars. They had trouble going uphill, and had a shorter range. But they were just as fast. Gasoline cars had no suspension back then and they shook themselves to pieces when driving cobble-stoned roads! They also stank horribly and soaked the air with noxious fumes. When you see pictures of people in old cars, they're wearing a cloak; this is to keep the stench of exhaust fumes out of their clothing. Electric cars were superior. But the makers of gasoline cars published attack ads claiming that the electric cars were dangerous. The old batteries would spray acid everywhere in an accident, and burn the occupants horribly. And the old wiring wasn't exactly perfect, so people were occasionally electrocuted by their cars. The gas-car manufacturers had a higher advertising budget and the courts weren't willing or able to prevent them from slandering the competition back then. So they flooded the public with exaggerated slander and people stopped buying electric cars. Even back then, the only effective way to bury a technology was to slander it. ",,1426451939,0,4,4

Clearly you've never been to the US. Explain to me, wise one who has no need of facts for their conclusion: What's your opinion of most of Pacific Coasts and New England? Do the policies of the Conservatives/Thatcherites differ considerably from the GOP policies (taking the differing starting points in mind)? Obama couldn't really be described as a fiscal conservative by any stretch of the imagination but [oddly enough, most Americans still approve](http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2010/images/09/03/rel12a.pdf)...weird, right? If I didn't know better I might say that either the American people's tolerance of higher taxes is underrated or they don't really prioritize it as highly as you seem to think they do.

Even with all that, I'm still trying to remain intellectually honest and admit, yes, this is probably just an odd time where people are tolerating higher taxes/spending if it prevents the worst, and Obama was carried in with a high tide, so that might explain some of the numbers, but it still doesn't put the US in the position of being insanely against taxation, which seems to be what you're saying. 

To go back a bit, yes if you hold an idea that seems mostly just held for the fact that it says something negative about another country, rather than it being true, then yeah that strikes me as a bit nationalistic, especially when it's coming from someone who (I don't know what country you're from so I can't be specific, but I'll assume Western Europe, probably British from your tone) resides in a country that was until recent history a colonial power (I'm also assuming you're not form Andorra, just playing the numbers game).

The very same trains we took to get to and from school.

I can say with authority that security theater is bullshit, what London, other parts of Europe, and plenty of other places *outside* the US go through regularly would bring ""small town Americans"" to overly paranoid tears and fear... signing away the rest of our liberties for empty comfort.

I don't remember being scared at the time of the bombings,  mostly because most of the people we traveled with were not scared.  They didn't function on fear, they functioned on intelligent caution, but still went about their day.  This attitude was contagious and so everyone went about their day, not as though nothing had happened, but they didn't allow the situations around them cripple their ability to work or travel.

I am guessing the question was U.S. focused, as in some countries dying from a terrorist bomb is more common than getting hit by a bus.

On occasion when traffic is a little wonky, when it feels a little ""off"" -like a gut feeling, I sometimes spontaneously will drive more cautiously than usual.  Being around really bad or irrational drivers scares me a lot more than death by terrorism.

&gt; In Argentina, we are quite ""outdoor"" people. We do lots of outdoor activities (sports, barbecues, sightseeing). I'm assuming indoor activities are more commonplace over there. Is that so? Also, how predominant is the night life (pubs/discos/etc.) given that nights are so long?

Swedes love being outdoors, so we cherish the summer months and try to spend as much time outside as possible when we have the chance. During the winter months we become more of an ""indoor"" people, but people still like to go out skiing even when there's no sunlight.

The night life is quite similar to other european countries, but be warned - swedes love to get drunk =) 

You have some great questions, I'll answer more after lunch.

Western European-descended persons tend to name their children Western European-derived names, such as William or Jennifer or Charles. It's an established convention, and it's regarded as normal by those people. To give children a name from a foreign culture seems strange (As much as I petitioned my sister to name her son after Ichiro Suzuki of the Mariners, it was pointless: she still went with ""Jack""). In the case of some recent immigrants, especially from Asian countries, they will give their children European names intensionally because the majority white population feel more comfortable with those names, and it speeds the process of integration. Others will continue to use names traditional to their culture of origin.

American Blacks, however, are neither recent nor distant immigrants, but the descendants of slaves brought against their will. They came from many tribes and spoke many languages, but when they became slaves their language and traditions and even their names were taken from them, since during that time their names were selected by the slaveholders. In truth, these folks have about as much reason to give their own children Anglo or German or Dutch names as my sister has to give her child a Japanese or Swahili name. In fact even less so, since to do so evokes that history of their ancestors being enslaved to those groups.

(or any group/organisation) have dramatically more rights or power than individual people.

Organisations are only as valuable to society as they are to individual welfare. A union is valuable in being able to help labor improve its conditions by creating an artificial modification to the labor supply curve.

This argument is like a faith-based initiative. Go to europe, unions have just as many negative components as they have positive ones, and while I think they should have more power now than they do to compensate for the enormous power of the owning class(in the US), I do not think they are, in and of themselves, a naturally positive/noble/divine concept.

The way I've always understood it, in communist rhetoric, communism was always a means to an end, the end being the perfect socialist paradise. 

Socialism, as envisioned by Marx and Engels was, ideally, a system where everyone would share the benefits of industrialization. Workers would do better than in the capitalist system at the time (The Communist Manifesto was published in 1848) because there were more workers than bosses and the majority would rule. Socialism is not a political system, it's a way of distributing goods and services. Communism is a political and economical system, which I've always understood was (as I've said before) a means to an end, where the end is socialism.

Which is why I say European countries aren't socialist, rather than capitalist with a little bit of socialism mixed in.

They also designed so that you can't attempt another action until you've gotten feedback from the server for your previous action.  This makes casting spells unplayable.  After casting a spell you have to wait to see the effects before you can move onto your next skill.  By that time, my spell is already off cooldown and my stamina back to full.  The game flows fine the few times I've manage ""green"" latency.  It's the only time I could chain cast different spells and exhaust my stamina bar.  But seeing as I can't find any info on them planning to have regional servers outside of japan - this is too much a deal breaker for me.

&gt;I just got back from a semester abroad in Europe, and let me tell you, it truly was the most magical, amazing experience of my entire life. The French countryside was like something out of a storybook, the Roman ruins were magnificent, and the men, well, European men are by far the most romantic in the world.

&gt;You American men all think you're so suave and sophisticated. Well, think again! European men make you look like the immature, inexperienced little children you are. They really know how to make a woman feel special over there. Unlike the so-called men here in the States, European men know how to treat a woman right.

&gt;For one thing, European men aren't afraid to come up and talk to you. And they know how to start slow, with a nice cup of Italian espresso or a long walk on some historic street. They know the places you can't find in any tourist guide. They know the whole history of the cities in which they live—who the fountains are named after, who the statues are.

&gt;I remember one unforgettable night in Athens, I sat and listened to a Greek sailor for hours as he told me about the countless men who fought over Helen back in ancient times. Afterward, he told me he loved his homeland even more now that he'd seen it through my eyes. I ask you, would an American man ever say something as deep and beautiful as that?

&gt;European men know the most romantic little cafés and bistros and trattorias, candlelit places where you can be alone and drink the most fantastic wine. They tell you what's on the menu and what you should try. (If it wasn't for a certain young man in Milan, I never would have discovered fusilli a spinaci et scampi.) And the whole time, they're looking deep into your eyes, like you're the only woman on the entire planet. What woman could resist a man like that? Then, after a moonlit stroll along the waterfront and a kiss in the doorway of their artist's loft, you find yourself unable to—well, I'll leave the rest to your imagination.

&gt;I'll never forget my magical semester abroad. One thing's for sure—I'm ruined for American men forever!


Counterpoint:

&gt;**American Women Studying In Europe Are Unbelievably Easy**
&gt;I'm a 25-year-old carpenter living in Rome, and I don't mind telling you that I get all the action I can handle. I'm not all that handsome or well-dressed, and I'm certainly not rich. In fact, my Italian countrywomen could take me or leave me. But that's just fine, because Rome gets loads of tourist traffic, and American co-eds traveling through Europe are without a doubt the easiest lays in the world.

&gt;Being European gives me a hell of an advantage. I'm not sure why, but there's something about the accent that opens a lot of doors. All you have to do is go up to them, act a little shy and say, ""Whould hyou like to go with me, Signorina, for a café?"" I actually have to thicken up my accent a little, but they never, ever catch on.

&gt;After a cheap coffee, which to them always tastes better than anything they've ever had, because they're in Europe, it's time to walk them. Now, all they know about Rome is what they've read in Let's Go, so you can pretty much just make up a whole bunch of shit. It's fun to see how much they'll swallow: As long as I refer to Italy as ""my homeland"" and other Italians as ""my people,"" they'll believe pretty much anything. I don't know who most of the local statues are, so I tell the muffins they're all great artists and poets and lovers. Once, just for the hell of it, I told a psychology major from the University of Maryland that a public staircase was part of the Spanish Steps, which she'd never even heard of. Another time, I told this blonde from Michigan State that the public library was the Parthenon, and she cooed like I'd just given her a diamond.

&gt;For dinner, I usually take them to some cheap little hole in the wall, someplace deserted where not even the cops eat. American girls think candlelight means ""romance,"" not ""deteriorating public utilities,"" so they just poke their nipples through their J. Crew sweaters and never notice that there's no electricity. Just as well, because Roman restaurants aren't exactly the cleanest. After a bunch of fast-talk about the menu, I get them the special, which is usually some anonymous pasta with spinach and day-old shrimp, and whatever cheap, generic, Pope's-blood chianti's at the bottom of the list.

&gt;By this time, they're usually standing in a slippery little puddle. Going in for the kill, I walk them past one of Rome's famous 2,000-year-old open cesspools. Then, as we open the door to my shitty efficiency, I kiss them on the eyelids so they don't see the roaches, making sure the first thing they see is the strategically positioned artist's easel I bought at some church sale. That's usually all they need to see and, like clockwork, they fall backwards on my bed with their Birkenstocks in the air.

&gt;I mean, they're hardly Italian women, but we have a saying here in Europe: Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?

[LordVoldemort](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/amn5a/a_little_boy_screams_and_cries_as_he_is_forcibly/c0ictey)  puts forth excellent arguments about the purported health ""benefits"" that come with circumcision.  Attached to the top of that thread is a [graphic video](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8212662920114237112) that clearly shows why many consider it to be harmful mutilation.

This was a topic of discussion on [4/21](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/btws1/convince_me_not_to_circumcise_my_child_this_is/).  Additionally, there have been user accounts, like [MrForeskin](http://www.reddit.com/user/MrForeskin) and [LordVoldemort](http://www.reddit.com/user/LordVoldemort) and [subreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/againstcircumcision) dedicated to educating people about the problems of circumcision.

in addition to the fact that it IS sexual violence, it is correlated with further [societal violence](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/byrkf/an_interesting_article_on_rape_culture_a_term_i/c0p8ehy)

It was advocated as a cure for [masturbation](http://www.cirp.org/pages/whycirc.html) and by [John Harvey Kellogg](http://www.circumstitions.com/Kellogg.html) as a punishment for the same:

&gt;Covering the organs with a cage has been practiced with entire success. A remedy which is almost always successful in small boys is circumcision, especially when there is any degree of phimosis. **The operation should be performed by a surgeon without administering an anæsthetic, as the brief pain attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon the mind, especially if it be connected with the idea of punishment, as it may well be in some cases.** The soreness which continues for several weeks interrupts the practice, and if it had not previously become too firmly fixed, it may be forgotten and not resumed. If any attempt is made to watch the child, he should be so carefully surrounded by vigilance that he cannot possibly transgress without detection. If he is only partially watched, he soon learns to elude observation, and thus the effect is only to make him cunning in his vice.


HEALTH:

A meta-study of 35 articles on circumcision vs. HIV found that:

&gt;When the raw data are combined, *** a man with a circumcised penis is at greater risk of acquiring and transmitting HIV than a man with a non-circumcised penis *** (odds ratio (OR)=1.06, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.01-1.12). Based on the studies published to date, recommending routine circumcision as a prophylactic measure to prevent HIV infection in Africa, or elsewhere, is scientifically unfounded.  (emphasis mine)

http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/vanhowe4/

&gt;According to the retrospective study of urinary tract infections (UTI's) in US military hospitals which is usually quoted in support of MGM, it requires at least 50 to 100 circumcisions to prevent a single UTI infection

fgc vs mgc:

Some would say that circumcision (MGC, make genital cutting/mutilation) is qualitatively different from FGC (Female genital cutting / mutilation).  That depends on the procedure.    Educate yourself about the female anatomy lest someone convice you that the entire clitoris is removed.

As can be seen at [3dvulva.com*](http://www.3dvulva.com/h_clit1.htm)  the clitoris isn't just the outside 'nub' part, so comparisons to FGC that is said to include ""cutting off the entire clitoris"" are likely inaccurate.

Finally, the accusation that FGM destroys sexual pleasure for a woman is incorrect, if sexual pleasure = orgasm:

In this study, it is shown that the women who had been mutilated / cut / circumcised actually had a higher orgasmic rate than the control (uncut) group:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17970975

&gt;&gt;RESULTS: The group of 137 women, affected by different types of FGM/C, reported orgasm in almost 86%, always 69.23%; 58 mutilated young women reported orgasm in 91.43%, always 8.57%; after defibulation 14 out of 15 infibulated women reported orgasm; the group of 57 infibulated women investigated with the FSFI questionnaire showed significant differences between group of study and an equivalent group of control in desire, arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction with mean scores higher in the group of mutilated women.

Another study has linked [circumcision](http://www.jurology.com/article/S0022-5347%2810%2902988-5) with a 'lower risk' of penile injuries(cuts, abrasions, etc) during sex, and thus concludes that there would be a lower risk of AIDS transmission.   Other factors were lubrication and condom use.  The former cannot be reversed; the latter two can be had.  Additionally, the study was done in Kenya, where [dry sex](http://sti.bmj.com/content/82/5/392.abstract)  (a sexual practice involving the deliberate dessication of the vagina) is a common occurrence.

fgc vs mgc: severity of procedures.   Some will argue that FGC type III involves sewing the labia shut.  This is an emotional argument when divorced from the fact that type III is *not* the most common type of FGC.  It would be like jumping ot a description of [subincision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penile_subincision) in an argument against circumcision as it is most commonly practised in the US.

The main article quotes a couple tweets from a tweet conversation Rob Weir was having. The other side of the conversation was not shown, so if you want to see it, you'll have to do some digging. If you do, you'll find that the denigration Weir is complaining about appears to be Berger's tweet about not enough ODF 1.2 features being included in the interoperability test at the event. Considering that the OASIS press release specifically called it a test of ODF 1.2 interoperability, it seems pretty reasonable to want the tests to be about more than 1 ODF 1.2 feature.

Anyone want to explain how that is denigrating the event?

There's also a link in the first paragraph to BN's earlier writings on this matter. The rest of the links are all to prior BN writings on different subjects. So let's follow the link to their prior article on this topic.

That takes us to an article that mostly is going off about the browser ballot in Europe. It eventually does get to the OO event in Budapest. There it tells us that someone at Microsoft has a presentation at that event (citing another Weir tweet). Apparently this is the basis of the ""crashing"" the event claim.

So, here's what we end up with. Microsoft, which has several people on the OASIS ODF TC, has someone giving a presentation at an OO event, and that person also wants to use the 1.2 interop test to test 1.2 features.

In 2002, she became the editor of a [trade magazine](http://www.clubsystemsinternational.com/) that focused squarely on DJ equipment and nightclub construction.  As with most trade magazines, it lasted a few scant years, growing thinner and thinner, until becoming online only.

I mention this GenX hipster because for all her frivolity and starfucking, she wrote one column that I still remember.  In it, she talked about rejecting her iPod (they came out in 2001, remember).  Her reasons?

She couldn't focus on music any more.

Her solution wasn't to get a turntable and grab some of the club cuts on vinyl, a logical approach considering her career.  No, her solution was to go back to the CD wallets she used to carry around.  Note that her problem wasn't fidelity.  Her problem wasn't portability.  Her problem was that for some reason she didn't have the attention span to listen to an entire album in its entirety unless she was forced to press eject, fish the CD into a wallet, fish another back out of a wallet, and fish it back into the CD player while in traffic in Manhattan.  

And somehow, this was the fault of the iPod.

This article is largely similar.  ""I won't finish a book unless I only have one book with me.""  This is the Kindle's fault?  I do most of my reading at home, where I'm surrounded by books.  I don't stop one and pick up another very often, and if i do, it's because what I'm reading is boring.  Is the difference between walking to the bookshelf and picking up a volume and pressing a few buttons and spawning a new book really going to be enough to destroy my attention span forever?

Kerri's argument was striking to me because she wasn't saying ""let's all go back to vinyl, it sounds better"" she was saying ""let's all go back to CDs because they're less convenient.""  She, too, made the argument that digital downloads are somehow disposable yet polycarbonate wafers are somehow holy - the magic of the jewel case, the fold out booklet... it was like a Special Olympics version of the Vinyl Litany.  This article is similar - ""oh, I love the smell of books!  Oh, I love spying on other people to see what they're reading!  Oh, I resent them for having a small gadget rather than a dog-eared bargain-bin paperback!""

'cuz that's really what we're talking about.  I worked in a bookstore for five years.  The majority of our sales?  Paperbacks and textbooks.  The paperbacks were so cheap from a manufacturer standpoint that if they didn't sell, we tore the covers off, shipped them back and binned the books themselves (as you might imagine, my bookshelf growing up had a lot of coverless paperbacks on it).  They didn't want the books to resell; they wanted proof that the books didn't sell so they could call it a loss.  

Which is stupid, really.  'cuz as a buyer of books, there's nothing I love quite so much as a used book store full of dusty old paperbacks... 'cuz they're cheap, they're forgotten, and they always have a vastly greater selection of stuff to read than Barnes'n'Noble or Walden or whatever.  But the publishers make no money on that anyway - it's the same problem as used CD stores (which, of course, [the record labels tried to crush](http://articles.latimes.com/1994-01-21/business/fi-14043_1_sony-music)).  There really is no market in retail sales of eclectic titles.  In fact, [literature has been indelibly shaped by grocery stores](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/28/books/28groc.html) to the point where average novel length has increased 80% to keep up with the market.  Grocery stores, you see, buy things for quantity, not quality, and they know they'll sell more 900 page books for $5.95 than 400 page books for $5.95.  And when grocery stores are one of the biggest purveyors of fiction, you stop making literature and start making product.  

Or you starve.

E readers have a chance to do for books what MP3 players did for music - destroy large monopolies, shatter a monolithic industry into a million tiny, balkanized fandoms and permit near-direct sales between creators and consumers.  I don't own one, but I'm on the ragged edge of buying a Kindle just to read scripts on (I give a shit about books; most of the stuff I have to read these days is PDF and I'm sick of spending my entire life on my laptop).  That said, there's a million and one books that I tend to buy for $1.00 with $4 shipping off of eBay because the only way to get them is used...

...or as an electronic download from Amazon.

Anybody who sees doom in this future is looking pretty hard for it, and their efforts are transparent.

Crimes do deserve jail time and some crimes are so heinous that they deserve incredibly long sentences. I did not say this guy should be locked up for life but under no circumstance can 100 days be justified. If not for any other reason then intensive observation, I can not believe that in 100 days this type of sickness could be fully diagnosed or treated.

I disagree that crimes ""deserve"" jail time. Jail was originally meant to be a means to rehabilitation, not a punishment. I think any system hampered by thoughts of what a crime ""deserves"" is doomed to failure. Really he should be confined to a mental institution until he is thought capable of handling himself. However, given he was young it's possible to grow out of that kind of thing. 

Basically, I feel 100 days is totally justified for a minor, no matter the crime, but I feel quite a bit better would be indefinite time in a place meant to resocialize troubled people. 

&gt;Some crimes do indeed deserve life imprisonment. You are saying that Ted Bundy should not have been imprisoned for life? John Wayne Gacey?

Do you think I didn't think at all about saying it? That I forgot serial killers existed? I think prison is the wrong place for such people. They are prime examples of folks who need to be confined for safety, but jails are not the right place for that. 

Basically, I feel jails as they currently exist serve no purpose. They are no more enlightened than the public beatings of years past, just more prolonged. They do very little to rehabilitate in most cases (which was the whole point of jail, to replace punishment with rehabilitation). And I especially feel the way we treat minor criminals is entirely wrongheaded. Some are helped by juvenile detention, but it seems most just learn something from the older kids and come out more hardened.

&gt;The British have a higher rate of violent crime then Americans do. In fact the UK has one of the highest levels of violence in Europe. In fact when robbery and simple assaults are taken into account the UK outranks South Africa in violent crimes. The British are not handling it better.

Britain was a bad pick. Okay, any other country in Europe. None of them have the kind of sentences we do IIRC.

&gt;I do agree with you, the business of the criminal justice system should not be punishment it should be protecting the public at large. Consensual crimes (drug use, prostitution etc) should be decriminalized immediately but crimes against a person, especially violence and sexual violence, should be prosecuted to the utmost. There is no place in a civilized society for those people who commit violence against others. Sexual predators such as this one violent criminals have the highest rate of recidivism. Almost 100% in both cases.

Well, for one you're way over on the recidivism rate thing. The commonly held belief was 66-75% for sex offenders, but that was always an exaggeration as well. More recent studies found it's about 24% at 15 years for all sex offenders. Lower for incestuous types (13%), higher for molesters of underage boys (35%). These probably are somewhat below the actual levels (because of plea bargains and unreported crimes) but even if they are significantly lower it still wouldn't approach 100%, or even 66%.

As for no place in civilized society, well, that supposes most people grow up in civilized society. However, if you're poor enough to worry about your next meal or even your next rent check, and you grow up in that environment, it trains you to think a certain way. Short term gains are FAR more valuable than long term gains. Taking advantage of others becomes far more palatable and reasonable when you really need something. Basically, if you're worrying about eating, or having shelter, that eclipses your worry about the safety of others, about jail, about morality entirely. For people in that environment it is entirely reasonable to resort to crime, and you will never ever fix that until you fix the environment that promotes these values. 

If you want everyone to be civilized, you basically have to extend the benefits of at least lower-middle class life to everyone.

This is true, and yet, I think that is as much evidence against your point as for it.  Because of 19th and 20th century immigration, ethnically we're roughly as divided as western Europe.  In some ways more.  If you break our population down, the largest groups are english (~8%), irish (~10%), african (~12%), german (20%), latino (who knows), etc.  It's hard to find reliable numbers but you get the idea. Everything common between these groups came into existence in the last two centuries, during which we had slavery, segregation, race riots, immigrant riots, and a civil war.  The American identity as the world knows it today is about 60 years old.  That's... not a lot of time to overcome our ridiculous ethnic background. 

So, yeah, I defer to your point that your differences are another step up on the ladder.  But going down one more step to where we're at now took all of a couple of generations.  It's really not that far off for you, with the way the EU is forming. ",,1426452782,0,1,1

(In fact, although Portuguese (and other European politicians) talk a lot of bullshit (after all they are politicians), i very much doubt they would be allowed to say even half of what i hear those from the US say.)

And to end, i remember a few months back, John McCain's mother was visiting Portugal, and she fell on the street, and stayed at one the two major (state run) hospitals in Lisbon.

What should have happened ? She should have been placed on a plane and sent home to be treated where she surely has healthcare ?",,1426452913,0,3,3

You're only looking at a snapshot in time, which is only a small piece of the picture. You have to go back much farther in time to understand why things are the way they are today.

In the pre-Christian Roman Empire hospitals were quite rare. The spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire drove an expansion of care for the sick and needy. The Council of Nicaea in 325 ordered the construction of a hospital in every town with a cathedral. Hospitals were almost exclusively church-run until about the 18th century. Non-religious hospitals didn't become common until the advent of the nation-state in the wake of the Reformation.

&gt;Most of the hungry or the poor rely on welfare, food stamps etc from the state. The churches do provide soup kitchens and such but the number of people they serve is dwarfed by the number of people helped by welfare and food stamps.

Like I said above, you have to look back at the origins of social care. Taking care of the needy was a huge role of the Church until relatively recently when it was overtaken by the state. At one point in the Middle Ages, the Church was feeding 10% of the population of Constantinople.

&gt;Only in europe where religion ushered in the dark ages. Religion is responsible for holding the western world back and hoarding information by only allowing monks to read and write and by opposing mathematics and science.

&gt;In the rest of the world no such limitations were imposed. Arabs, indians, chinese etc all advanced at a faster pace than europe until the religious hegemony over knowledge was broken in europe.

&gt;Only after religion was overthrown as the sole repository of written knowledge did enlightenment begin.

Um, I think you need to reread why the dark ages are called the dark ages. It actually has nothing to do with religion. Western Europe experienced a loss of Greek and Roman scholarship amid the chaos of the collapse of the Western Roman Empire and ended up stuck in a period of intellectual stagnation. Meanwhile the Eastern Roman Empire (a.k.a. the Byzantine Empire) preserved Greek and Roman scholarship and ended up outlasting the Western half of the empire by 1000 years. The Arabs inherited Greek classical scholarship from the Byzantines. The Byzantine Empire was technologically and scientifically advanced, incredibly rich, and thoroughly Christian.

Western Europe was revitalized by Byzantine scholars fleeing West to escape the Muslim conquest of the Byzantine Empire over the last century of its existence, which lead to the Renaissance.",,1426453200,0,0,0

Many gypsies chose a lifestyle which is simply not compatible with ""modern"" way of living. Many of them neither have ""real"" work nor do they want to settle down and get real work. Many (very many) do not want their kids to go to school and they often fight every attempt to bring them to school tooth and nail because it, like finding a work, would force them to settle down and give up their nomadic lifestyle. As a direct consequence of this, they usually reside at the absolute bottoms regarding their working abiity, of any society they happen to drive through. This again yields to awfully low incomes and living standards, which, compared to the ""rich"" (from their self-inflicted point of view) neighbourhoods they like to travel, basically pushes them into theft and at the same time serves as a justification for theft.

The negative experiences range from theft, theft and theft over again (and this is understandable, when nobody of them was working, and they werent producing and selling anything on the road, what else could they live from anyway?), threatenig kids, women and retirees, tried and realized robbery, housebreaking, disposing garbage basically _everywhere_, disposing feces _everywhere_, in bushes, behind peoples hedges, everywhere. Basically everything you would expect in your worst nightmares really _does_ happen when a Gypsy caravan decides to visit your town.

They are still trying to live a life from the times of the great tribal migration period, but hell, back then they werent the only ones moving around and couldnt attract anyones attention. But approx 1500 years have passed since then, and every other tribe has either gone extinct or settled down in some way. A purely nomadic way of living, as the Gypsies are still trying to live for traditional reasons, I suppose, is extremely unproductive compared to settling down, and will _always_ force them, purely economically, to either live in extreme poverty, and then it does not matter if in France, Germany or Romania, or to steal their way through the continent, and to leave every place soon enough not to get caught. I've even had cases where people from our neighbourhood have, years later, as the same Gypsy tribe honored us with another visit, reckognized their old stolen stuff (garden furniture, etc) which the Gypsies didnt remember who they have stolen it from and didnt bother to hide.

The only reason the problem with the Gypsies arise only now is that Romania and Bulgaria only recently joined the EU. A few years earlier France, Germany etc. wouldnt have allowed the Gypsy caravanes to enter their countries _at all_, so most of them were basically trapped in eastern Europe. Now, with the European borders wide open, from the point of view of the Gypsy tribes, what would be the point to content themselves with roaming other godforsaken eastern european countries like Estonia or Slovakia, when you can get straight to Paris or Rome, without detours. Hell, I know I wouldnt.",,1426453430,0,52,52

If you're serious about querying the craft of historical writing it might be work it to look at J.L. Gaddis' ""Landscapes of History"" and Anthony Grafton's ""Footnote"". Gaddis is a good introduction to some of the theoretical problems of the field - not the last word on the subject by any means as you'll have to look at Hayden White and his followers eventually but its a good start. Gaddis has the advantage of not being too theoretically challenging. A decided benefit when when you're staring down the barrel of a semester of post-modern theory (good times). Grafton's text provides some interesting insight in the formal development of historical writing (as the title implies) but for a history of the footnote it is a very entertaining read. 

Thinking about the stuff I've been reading, David Wootton's essay ""New Histories of Atheism"" in Hunter &amp; Wootton's ""Atheism from the Reformation to the Enlightenment"" is a stellar example of summary. Also, the Italian preface to Carlo Ginzburg's ""The Cheese and the Worms"" is a remarkable example of how to distill a number of approaches into their most essential kernel. The Ginzburg book should be easy to find for cheap and it is a great read just for the hell of it. It follows the heresy trial of a Friulian miller named Dominico Scandalla (aka Menocchio) and is a terrific exercise in micro-history, cultural history and the history of unbelief/heterodoxy. There are some very legitimate criticisms of the text but Ginzburg is a great example of historical writing (even in translation). 

Finally, Theodore Rabb's ""The Struggle for Stability in Early Modern Europe"" has an excellent historiographical approach. In a very short space he traces the development of the crisis thesis in seventeenth century culture from Hazard in 1935 to what was contemporary in 1975. His conclusions are problematic - rather too broad I'm afraid - but a great example of a literature survey. I hope you'll excuse the sixteenth-eighteenth century bias in my suggestions but it's what I'm absorbed in. If you have a chance to look at some of these, you may find some insight or inspiration for how to approach your essays. 

It's cool to see a young student interested in historiography. My adviser and I share a rather profound belief in the importance of understanding issues in theory and method.

It is a common misconception that EU citizens cannot be sent back to their country of origin from another member state. However, the law specifies the actual limitations of this right to reside outside your country of citizenship.  These are:

- Finding work within 6 months of moving to the host country.

OR

- Having the means to sustain yourself in the host country without relying on welfare or social services.

OR

- Having resided in the host country for five years while following the conditions set above.

That is actually pretty generous and covers the vast majority of people moving their residence between two member states. If people move from Eastern to Western Europe looking to work and improve their lifestyles then there is no problem. However, when they want better social services and prove themselves unwilling to contribute to the system, then they should be sent back and that is that.

It's nice that we're keeping this discussion civil...

&gt;the state is what encouraged slavery 

I disagree.  Southern slaveocrats encouraged slavery.  The Federal government was ambivalent about slavery, because just as now, it was then dominated by elite interests--and some of those elite interests were vested in slavery (southerner elites), while others were not (northerner elites).  Consequently, there were some hypocrisies and contradictions within the system--but to say the state ""encouraged slavery"" is pretty misleading.  For instance, the Fugitive Slave Act ostensibly ""encouraged slavery"" in that it required the Northern States to cooperate with Southern states in apprehending run-away slaves--but it gave the Northern states sufficient latitude in executing that cooperation that they could effectively wiggle out of their obligation by refusing to offer compensation to law enforcement officers for time spent apprehending run-away slaves.

Jim Crow laws followed the civil war.

Blacks did have it relatively nice immediately after the civil war.  However, shortly after the end of the Reconstruction in 1878, their plight took a nose dive that wouldn't recover until the civil rights movement starting in the 50's.  A strong central government is not an instant panacea for all social ills.  It's *necessary* but not *sufficient*.  Without a strong central government, what would have compelled the slavocrats to abandon their livelihood?  Europe banished slavery without war--but did they do so without a strong central government?

The economy was not engaged in productive activities and was super saturated in debt.   There was no way out other than Argentina style.

PS; most of the time when a country goes Argentina style, investors just pull out their cash and park it in Europe or the USA, This time, there is no exit ... which pretty much means gold.

I'm from Serbia and we have a very big Gypsy problem in that there are Gypsy camps all over the place, along with the crime, garbage etc. that always accompany them. Recently, the cops had to evict a bunch of Gypsy squatters from a plot of land in order to begin an overhaul of one of the main bridges in Belgrade.

To call the camps an eyesore is an understatement: shacks interspersed with piles of garbage, rotting furniture, discarded and rusty appliances... Portable landfills. And there are dozens of them in Belgrade alone. 

Back to the bridge. The city was about to sign a deal with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development on a loan for the repairs when the bank people demanded that the evicted Gypsies, who had been living on land that did not belong to them, get proper housing. This caused a public uproar because many people, people who have jobs and are trying very hard to make ends meet while playing by the rules, don't have the luxury of getting housing for free. Eventually the city decided to seek funding elsewhere and put the Gypsies in furnished shipping containers

They do very little to endear themselves to others. In school, they tend to be the bullies. In their teens, they progress to crime. My bike was stolen by two Gypsies. Gypsies beat up on my sister and brother in school. Gypsies harassed a close friend of mine. A Gypsy stole money from my girlfriend. Another tried to steal a coworker's cell phone on a bus. These are all cases off the top of my head that I know of first-hand.

So before criticizing people for reacting in a perfectly rational way to an ethnic group that has no regard for law and order, you might want to actually get to know something about the situation.

Quite so.

None of this, however, changes the factual truth of the matter; We in the US have a large unskilled labor force -- many of whom are the result of our comparatively open immigration policies -- and as we haven't priced them out of the workforce, our average productivity per worker will suffer.

Here. What do you make of this. I wrote it a while back. I hope someone reads it and thinks, yeah. Thats a fair summary.

____

The problem is there's no card the Palestinians hold, except for recognition of Israel. And Israel wants them to play that before they start negotiations.

Israel is the regional power. It is the big mean dog, it has all that it wants, the land, military dominance over all its neighbors, trade, the coverage of the worlds only super power. Therefore Israel wants to maintain the current power status quo as is. Israel wants to impose its will on a defeated people and call this peace. 

I dont expect everyone to agree with the Palestinian POV but at least to understand it.

Palestinians do not place the same premium on peace the Israelis do. This is because they have very little. They have issues that need addressing, the right of return, the occupation of the West Bank, the annexation of Jerusalem, the economic shut down, the total control and blockade of their areas. They see peace as surrender. This is why they keep firing rockets and launching suicide attack. They want justice. The ruled always do.

To get Peace the Israelis have to address issues they simply do not want to. Until Israel is prepared to do that, there will not be peace.

It can be done, The UK showed the way when it talked to the IRA with **no pre-condtions**. No, ""edit the United Ireland part of your charter"" before we talk. The commander of the Londonderry IRA is now a UK member of parliament and Northern Ireland is still a part of the UK. By talking to the extremists, you fractionalise them, those that want peace, the pragmatists, and those that want to fight, the idealists.      

To strengthen the hand of those that want peace serious concessions have to be made, when those that want to derail the peace talks strike with rocket attacks and car bombs you have to be very careful with retaliation. Its a long slow road, but there was a time when Northern Ireland looked as hopeless as Palestine, but look at it now.
Now there will be those that will never ever give up, that will always want a united Ireland or Jews out of Palestine, but it is possible to make life comfortable enough for the general population that these idealists find their population base eroded away to the point of making there fight impossible. If you have a job, a sense of there being justice then you are lass likely to be recruited by the bombers.
 
The solution to the problems obvious. All the peace plans are essentially the same. Clinton's Peace Plan, the Nusseiba-Ayalon Plan, the Saudi Peace Initiative, Bush’s Road Map, Oslo, Taba summit are all similar

They all include clear measures that Israel has to take in order to make peace:

1.Dismantle the settlements.   
2.Withdraw its soldiers and civilians from the occupied territories,   
3.Allow the creation a viable Palestinian state.    
4.find a solution for the Palestinian refugees' right of return. A massive compensation package?     
5.Find a way to guarantee Israeli security. Altho' I believe having nuke addresses that.    
6.A creative way to reward Israel for giving up what it feels it has won in war.     

The problem is Israel will not to go along with these plans. At some point the talks will fail. Developing new plans is a waste of time. Israel wants land, specifically the West Bank. Israel has not dismantled a single settlement built there, and has never ceased to take Palestinian lands under the guise of security. This is the underlying tactic. The aim is to create a ""reality on the ground"" where it become impossible to uproot 100,000's of settlers. The Palestinians will become a servant population within this greater Israel ruled by a compliant Palestinian authority.

My greatest insight occurred while living in Israel. I came to realize Israel has the story arc of a typical colonialist project. Europeans jews using American Jewish wealth, politics and violence to transfer a native population from their land using using a tried and true tactic. You start friendly, grow in strength, then remove more natives, when they see what is happening and they resist play the ""we are the victims of native violence"" card and use greater violence to remove greater numbers. Continue until you got all you want.

See the Founding of the USA, Australia, South Africa etc for details.

Reality: nothing will change until the Israelis put peace before land.

0,1283720778,AskReddit,,t3_d9wt8,True,t1_c0ymt2j,False,LeeHyori,,t5_2qh1i,0,t3_d9wt8,True,c0ymt2j,"*Note*: Universal healthcare is NOT free healthcare. Free healthcare and healthcare paid for by taxes are two completely different things.

The reason why Americans are so against the idea, in general, is because America was built on highly liberal notions of freedom (i.e.: conservative foundations in current terminology), and are likewise extremely suspicious and distrustful of the idea of increasing the size of the federal government, the entity that has a monopoly over the use of *military force*. The dangers of a highly centralized government range from decreasing economic freedom to, sooner or later, complete totalitarianism. The record of history has been crystal clear on this concept and it has repeated itself again and again in all nations that have slipped *too* far left. 

Social programs run by the US federal government are notorious for being inefficient and ineffective. Social programs are forced to ration if the government wants to remain within the budget allotted to that social welfare program, lest go into the negative and pile up debt. The United States, even in its terrible economic condition right now, is ""only"" in 94% or so debt of its annual GDP. Other welfare European countries have been well over 100%, even 400%+ of GDP in debt for decades, even *before* the global recession because of their growing entitlement programs and shrinking productivity (*edit: this is considering public and private debts, assuming private debts are at least somewhat a result of exorbitant excise/consumption taxes in the private sector and hurtful government intervention in the economy, which impede growth. Considering only public debt, Canada, The United Kingdom, Japan, Italy, Greece, France, etc., are all still significantly more indebted than the USA, despite its costly wars*). Further, because there is a monopoly over health insurance and the health related industry, there is no incentive to create better, more competitive products, packages, etc. Worse, the government, depending on its other budget priorities or because of the program's unsustainability, may have to cut spending in the sector, reducing the number of doctors, unfairly slashing their payments and/or increasing wait times—lest plunge further into debt or having to increase taxes and hurting businesses and consumers alike. Quality will slowly decline and no innovation will take place—essentially stagnating the market and hurting future generations through unpaid debts and second-tier medicine. 

Social programs invite abuse and only transfer these ills onto tax paying citizens, sapping their motivation to work as a result of progressively heavier tax burdens. In addition, social programs seem to create dependency for individuals on them, meanwhile endlessly expanding and becoming more and more expensive. Closely related is the problem of political inertia: Even if a universal, single-payer system was put into effect in the US and was proven to fail, re-privatizing the system becomes borderline impossible, and most of the time, the government just chooses to try and keep the inefficient, money-drain going on tax heavy life-support, instead of letting it die in its final throes. Reddit should know about this, what with the anti-Drug War sentiment floating about.

As for those who compare the allegedly ""successful"" and highly socialist Scandinavian countries to America (which have all been in debt over their heads forever now, and still considerably more than the US in terms of debt:GDP), putting the two side by side is a weak statement. Logistically, the two countries are completely incomparable. It is easier to administer and effectively control a socialized system when your population is the size of Alabama's, and the entire country is effectively smaller than the majority of US states. If anything can be learned from this, however, it would be that individual states, as to be explained further in the following paragraph, should enact their own state-level socialized systems.

The United States constitution leaves no room for federal run social welfare programs like socialized health insurance or healthcare. If an individual state, like Louisiana, wants to have socialized medicine, then it can enact a system by itself through its 10th Amendment constitutional right. If citizens of Louisiana do not want the healthcare system because they disagree with it or do not want to pay taxes toward the cause, then (1) it is easier for them to vote it out, because democracies work better on smaller scales, and (2), they have the option of moving to another state—a better system of checks and balances. On the other hand, if the federal government were to control, administer and put into effect a system, every single American would be subject to it and thus have no freedom of choice.

The United States of America is supposed to be, well, a UNION of INDEPENDENT STATES.

First of all, some of the information in that article is plain wrong. While many Germans do have six weeks of paid vacation a year, the mandated vacation is not six weeks, but only four (the law states ""24 days"", which is usually taken to mean four weeks by the courts as at the time the law was written the normal labour week was 6 days and the intention of the law was to provide 4 weeks of paid vacation). Child care is generally not 'free of charge', and university education is not free everywhere (some states introduced fees of about 500€ per semester a few years ago).

Second of all, when you consider the behaviour of a group, it is important to understand the underlying culture. Culture depends largely on the history of the group, and how that history both influenced the establishment of institutions and selected for certain traits in the population. 

Consider how the US was populated: The early immigrants were largely people suffering from religious or political prosecution, and adventurers trying to 'make it big' in the New World. These people liked to take risks, to gamble, to strive for personal achievements. Personal recognition, individualism, and a love of risk were considered beneficial traits. The institutions they established still show the effects of these initial attitudes.

Now consider those who stayed behind in Europe: In general, these were the people who were less willing to take risks, who were not willing to give up their relationships with friends and family, and who generally considered their established communities to be more important to their lives than any personal accomplishment they might make on another continent among strangers. Security, a sense of community, and being content were the preferred traits here. Again, the institutions reflect these sentiments.

During the 20th century, Germany was the initiator of two World Wars. The effects of these wars, particularly the horrors of the 2nd WW and the amount of destruction, have had a lasting effect on the German population (another effect was the hyperinflation in the early 20s (Wikipedia has a nice [image](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:100-Billionen-Geldschein-2.jpg) of a 100 trillion German Mark bank note from 1924)). Germans became obsessed with risk and uncertainty: Whereever there was any way to reduce uncertainty, even at the cost of opportunities, it had to be done. Thus, the ""soziale Marktwirtschaft"" (social market economy) was established, introducing a series of mechanisms to reduce the potential effects of economic downturns and other crises.

The question now is: Can a similar system be introduced in the US? Can the US just introduce mandatory vacation, shorter work hours, and incentives to form labour unions and expect to improve their situation?

To use a German expression: Jein*.

I think that it might be in principle possible to introduce something vaguely similar to the German/European system in the US, but only in the very, very, *very* long run. As has been pointed out by researchers like Trompenaars and Hofstede, culture usually changed only very slowly, due to the self-enforcing mechanisms it encompasses. A certain amount of consistency over time is a necessary condition for a stable society. If you start messing with the institutions too quickly, you get chaos. There are certain circumstances under which culture can change more quickly (Hofstede mentions severe economic distress or significant technological break-throughs (pp. 11-13 of ""Culture's Consequences"", 2nd ed.). For example, the introduction of cheap long-distance communications caused rapid cultural changes in formerly isolated island states such as Japan due to the sudden and rather unexpected inflow of new influences (in the case of Japan, both the technological developments and an economic crisis happed at pretty much the same time). 

Personally, I can't imagine any technological development (short of Stark Trek-type replicators and unlimited power supplies that completely eliminate scarcity) radical enough to drastically alter the US culture in a direction that would allow for the introduction of a European System in the US in the near future. It is very hard to estimate how quickly cultures will change in the future (considering all the effects of global communitation, they are generally expected to be able to change more quickly than in the past due to the higher amount of outside influence, but there is currently no working model to accurately describe these effects), but I doubt that the US will be anywhere near a European system within the next 40 or 50 years. Of course, we are constantly learning new things about cultural change (there are quite a few active researchers), so I'll probably refine that statement in two or three years.

\* ""Jein"" basically means ""Yes and No"", consisting of the words ""Ja"" (Yes) and ""Nein"" (No), and is used when a question does not have a clear ""Yes or No"" answer.",,1426454001,0,148,148

This was most obvious during the Chrysler/Daimler merger when the US executives made 2-3 times more money and were expected to work 80 hour weeks.

But there is an alternate analysis too. Since Europeans have higher taxes, there is more non-income compensation (e.g., longer vacation times, more company benefits, better work environments) that are not taxed.

The decentralist cause is very intertwined with and related to libertarianism.  I wouldn't say it's really 'all about' that though. 

The States Rights cause has been used for many noble causes (this is to rebut the 'slavery' charge): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrcM5exDxcc&amp;feature=player_embedded

Tom Woods:
&gt; the Principles of ’98 – as these decentralist ideas came to be known – were in fact resorted to more often by northern states than by southern, and from 1798 through the second half of the nineteenth century were used in support of free speech and free trade, and against the fugitive-slave laws, unconstitutional searches and seizures, and the prospect of military conscription, among other examples. Nullification was employed not in support of slavery but against it.

There are many 'lenses' with which to look at libertarianism.  It could be looked at as encouraging decentralization and polycentrism and competing governments; a sort of scientific experiment with many different trials.  Or it could just be considered on an issue-by-issue basis. Or just an ethical position.

&gt;  In my mind, abolishing the federal government would create a situation where inter-state trade, environmental regulations, defense, and labor laws would be virtually non-existent.

No, this is incorrect.  Each individual state could produce laws to those effects.  The libertarian position on all of those issues is that if there is a government, then it should only protect against violations of person and property.  So having the government use coercion to help labor unions is a no-go.

BTW, the relationship between the members countries in the EU and the states in the US is very similar.  Going back to a state by state system in the US would basically create countries analogous to the European countries. California's economy is about the size of France's, etc.   

&gt; Or maybe we would build treaties based on such issues. Either way, to me it still seems like a step backwards rather than forward.

On the inter-state trade question, actually the only purpose of the 'commerce clause' was for the federal government to prevent states putting up tariffs.  And that was actually very astute of the framers.  That could be a problem in the absence of a federal government - however I believe that the states would quickly create some sort of free trade alliance.",,1426454274,0,6,6

The Parti Socialist (PS), who was set to deliver the prime minister and of which Laurette Onkelinkx is a member, very much wants the country to stay together. Imho, the main reason they suddenly went from ""don't worry, we'll keep 'em together"" to ""byebye"" is to provoke outrage in their own supporters (and many others). They also realise less than 50% of the country actually wants a breakup and creating an attitude that it might actually happen may turn public sentiment against the more separatist parties.

They very much blame the N-VA (the biggest party right now, separatist) for making the government negotiations fail and either want to make them fail as well or make them accept reform that doesn't go too far.
I'd like to point out here that the N-VA does NOT want a sudden break-up of the country, they never have. They simply want more and more responsibilities to devolve to the Regions and Communities or to the EU (!) until the Belgian state becomes unnecessary. They have already stated they do not want the country to actually break up if these government talks fail.

By the way, according to the N-VA and CD&amp;V (the two parties who said no to the plans and which represents about 50% of all Flemish seats, nearly 1/3 of all total seats -- the N-VA wasn't the only to reject as the article incorrectly states), the plans created a lot of reform in name, but not in fact. That is to say the regional governments would become responsible for a great many things, but the financial aspect would still be regulated on a federal level. Which basically means ""you can sign the cheques, but you can't decide how large they are and who's gonna get them"". So they wanted strict guarantees that the financing of the country would be completely restructured, which was ""principally agreed to"", immediately followed by Walloon politicians telling their supporters it was basically an empty box they wouldn't have to deal with for several years.

The N-VA wanted to push ""financial responsibility"" on the regions, but this was *apparently* met with a fear that it would cause the Walloon region to become poorer. Which in itself expresses everything a lot of Flemish people feel is wrong with Wallonia: leeching off the federal state, and Flanders in extension, while doing nothing to reduce their own spending. (As an example: iirc half of ALL jobs in Wallonia are created by the government, either directly or indirectly -- which is just insane).

I have a feeling I'm gonna have to start ranting on this subject soon (like on how they are 2 completely different cultures, Francophone are considered arrogant in the Flanders because they refuse to learn Dutch even when moving to Flanders -- I can attest this firsthand -- whereas the Flemish tend to integrate quite quickly in the south, how the north is more right wing and the south very left, etc, etc). It's a fucked up situation is all.

Back to the article:
The King sent the leaders of Senate and House to lead a reconciliation attempt, not the speakers of the regional parliaments. Though one is indeed Flemish and the other Walloon, from the same 2 large parties. They aren't among those who are usually part of formation talks or other high level discussions (though one is a former Defense minister -- not a very good one imho), so who knows, might get interesting.

Lastly, everyone mentioned in the article is a Walloon politican from the Parti Socialist. Makes for a very one-sided article if you ask me. 

Note: I'm Flemish, I'm for far-reaching regional authorities (but not full-blown separatism, more a confederate model) and it's 4 AM and I appear to be incapable of writing this down properly.",,1426454293,0,30,30

He asks where you are getting your doctorate?  

What is the main development in music in that era? That is the prime era of the common practice period. Similarities in how music is viewed in terms of music notation becomes standardized throughout Europe. Functional Harmony becomes the primary paradigm (Rameau falls into this).  

Something you might want to look at is the gradual shift in attention in music from the performer and composer as serving as a particular function towards music as art and composer as a genius creator. Kant plays into this, this whole idea of art and aesthetics. During the Baroque period, music was more functional, written for the court, for the church, for specific entertainment. When written for the public, it was written as a consumer entertainment for the home or for specific singers or superstars to gain an audience. Very much seen as functional.  

Starts with Mozart, but with Beethoven we begin the major shift toward independent artists creating art for future generations. The whole idea of the concert and concert hall as a space where we can contemplate these works of art.

Unrifled muskets were effective out to about 100 yards for the most part, maybe 250 in a sharpshooters hands and that's comparable to a modern sniper hitting a mile away.

When rifling came along in the mid-19th century the range went up to about 300 to 600 yards.  

With weapons that inaccurate, so slow to reload (effective rate of fire was 3 to 5 shots a minute), you had to have men stand in formation to concentrate fire enough to be effective.  To give you an idea of how comparatively innacurate they were, take a look at the stats on this [battle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Guilford_Court_House) during the Revolutionary War.  Compare the numbers of troops involved with the actual casualties.
Now compare the numbers here with the advent of rifled muskets in this [battle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Shiloh).  

Why are the casualties rates so high in comparison?  They were using generally the same tactics that had been around since the early 18th century with muskets with the big difference of the rifling.  
Rifling had been around a long time, however it was difficult to load properly as the round had to fit the barrel perfectly.  This prevented them from being generally effective until the invention of the [Minie Ball.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini%C3%A9_ball).  This greatly improved the reliability along with the cap firing system over the old flintlock system.

However you ask about guerrilla tactics compared to standing in a line?  Ever heard of the French and Indian War?  Read about [this battle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Monongahela).  Yes, guerrilla tactics were incredibly effective against musketry.  Imagine a Mohawk Indian just running up to you while you're trying to yank your rod out of the barrel and split your skull open with an ax.  This is why they issued [these](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayonet).  It was actually quite common in many battles during the age of muskets to degenerate into big clubbing matches once they got close enough to each other.  A great example would be Borodino during the Napoleonic Wars. This is also why officers carried swords all the way up until the end of WWI.

However, since Europe had been so completely plowed over for the past 1000 years, it was actually more common to find open fields to fight in.  This is what Europeans were conditioned to fight in so they just simply did it that way.  [Some learned how to do it different ways](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_rangers)

Workers at plant b want the wood to make cabinets. Half the wood is not enough for a run at either plant. Who decides who gets the wood? Is there a resource court? Is this the basis of a socialist mini-resource war? The socialist party USA will elect or appoint a government agency to deal with this.

It depends. Is this democratic socialism? Communism? If it's communism, is it libertarian anarchy, or is it mutualism?

A democratic socialist state would have an elected or directly democratic council which would vote on such issues. A communist society would make decisions through general consensus, or at the will of those involved.

&gt;You may say that socialism is not communism because it leaves some right or decision to the individual.

Socialism is not communism because calling socialism communism is like saying rectangles are squares. Communism is stateless socialism (anarchy). Communism is the square, socialism is the rectangle.

&gt;The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics - somebody thought they were socialists.

You've really reduced your argument to the name alone? I assume you also believe that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a shining example of democracy.

&gt;The ones that are kicked out are always the true socialists and the ones in power are not true socialists because they struggled for power and leadership.

Louis XVI, Nicolas II, and Puyi are socialists now?

&gt;At this stage though there are many more true believers that these exiled spoiled sports. The true believers are giddy - finally they will have a just society of the people - wait what? - there is not enough food. People are disgruntled? There is a black market? This must be stopped. We will show these peasants. We do not refer to them as death squads they are state patrols bringing dissidents in line. An on it goes until complete failure and a complete disowning by all socialists everywhere. It is a repeated pattern.

You not only completely misunderstand socialist theory, but you also completely misunderstand history. Directly following the October revolution and the overthrow of the provisional government the living standards of the Russian people improved dramatically. Life expectancy shot up, famine disappeared, (in contrast to the 11 famines in the 10 years leading up to the revolt) and Russian citizens were able to elect representatives to their soviets. It wasn't until Stalin was elected as party leader did the media suppression, unjust trials, and destructive economic plans enter into the equation, and it was at this point, immediately, [when left communists came out opposing the USSR and Stalin's policies.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4th_International) Not after it had gone on a while, not after the USSR had begun to fall, as immediately as policies turned authoritarian, the early 1930s.

&gt;If I were an aircraft engineer who had made 30 attempts to get a plane of a certain design off of the ground then I would not be a good engineer and the design for the plane should be abandoned for good.

Again...

&gt;The concept of an isolated 'socialist state' is an inherently flawed one. Socialism can be arrived at through gradual global movement down a continuum, not a singular revolution, much like capitalism did not arrive on the scene in one quick swoop, in a single, well defined state. It grew gradually out of feudalism.

This myth appears in nearly every debate on the future of Belgium and I'll try to poke a few holes in it, if you don't mind.

First off, there is no inherent wealth in Brussels. It has no harbour, no international aeroport (in fact it relies on Flanders for both of those) no natural resources, and no vast industrial sites. Its wealth is only due to the service economy it provides. Companies have their presence in Brussels only because it is the capital of Belgium (and the headquarters of the EU). 

Now, In the event of a separation, Flanders will withdraw its own administration from Brussels and begin an economic competition (it can offer companies much cheaper tax rates for only the cost of moving offices a few miles in any direction). Aside from that there is also the matter of the Flemish workforce (the only ones who can give a company linguistic access to the Flemish region).

Newsflash: the vast majority of Basques don't want to separate from the rest of Spain. And as far as I know, the majority of Catalunyans don't either. In both cases it's just a VERY vocal (and in the case of ETA, attacking) minority that do all this noise. And the real radicals are mainly farmers and small village people from rural towns.

In Asia, the survival imperative was simple: you wanted to get ahead? Have enough food left after harvest to feed yourself and family? Get a job?

So yes, pretty much exactly like Jerusalem /s.

Belgium is a created state. They had to publish an ad to find a king for this bizarre Frankenstein (which fits because of the French and Germanic connotations of that name). They combined people from various cultural roots and called it a country, a people. The people, however, are just the ball at play in the game. And because of the curious nature of the country, the game is played with the following rules: One party wins if the ball doesn't move. The other wins when it can withhold the ball from the other team.

Our country is brought to a standstill every time they tackle the institutional structure of our country. The past decades there was a tradition of 'The Belgian Compromise"". This is one where in a discussion the ultimate goal is to find a compromise that's pretty much the same as the old deal. Content is usually neglected, it's about disagreeing, but agreeing to agree. This creates a pointless feedback loop where our country cannot reform anything because everything is intertwined with all the rest. Any Flemish demand will affect Walloon political/power positions. Any more self-government for the Walloons will mean Flanders will have to pay in return.

You have Brussels, with some Flemish communities around it. Now the people living there can vote for people in Brussels. To split that, so they can only vote for Flemings (it is in Flanders, not Brussels, so it *is* quite silly to let them vote in Brussels), Flanders would have to pay 500 million euro each year, every year to Brussels.

Now, Flanders already pays 9 B a year to Wallonia (through the federal government money flows). Brussels now receives 500M from Flanders. They want another 500M. The thing is, Brussels has been transferring money it got from Flanders to Wallonia too, which means Flemish taxpayers are asked to show respect (give money) to Wallonia and Brussels, but in the end, they pay twice to Wallonia.

This is silly.

For clarity, I'm a Fleming, semi-pro splitting Belgium (there is no rush, I'd say within 50 years) and I don't mind sharing wealth with a poorer region, but I'd rather see this aid flow through Europe, than our federal government. I don't think Wallonia should get more Flemish money than say some Baltic country. I'm a bit unhappy about the entitlement and endless status quo.

Edit - Some numbers: Brussels has a working budget of 2B a year. Half of that is paid by Flanders. Only 5% of people in Brussels are Flemings, but many Flemings work there, without living there. Brussels is about 20% of our national product.",,1426454884,0,1,1

Well, plenty of people at the time thought the way that you did, and plenty of them tried it. And most of them lost horribly. The reasons why they lost is plentiful, but here is some of the bigger reasons:

Cavalry. It is practically impossible for infantry to repulse Cavalry without being in the line and column formation.

Communications. You can only communicate within the line of sight, and if you are fighting in a loose formation, things get chaotic in no time.

Order and discipline: It is much easier to maintain order in your troops if they are in line formations.

It's interesting you refer to science backing religion up. I think originally Christianity had a basically decent message to give. Common people were not educated enough to understand the reasoning, but the information was basically sound. It was couched in parables and allegories to make it easier to understand - at that time - for people of that education level.  We're talking about late Iron age people, compare their understanding of the world around them with ours. Consider their capacity to even seek an answer to a question. It almost always went back to the priesthood. And they almost always have to make decisions that concur with earlier ones, for the sake of the coherency of dogma.

And that is where my issue comes in, Catholicism is not a pure philosophical construct. It's layer upon layer of ""prior art"". It has elements of stone age worship, it has elements of pantheist worship, it's the end result of 1000's of previous years of religious culture from Europe and the Middle East. It's not just what Jesus said walking around Galilee. If it were, things would be so much simpler.

After Jesus died, an organisation eventually came into place - what we know today as the Catholic church. That was founded by Saul/Paul, the same guy who took money from the Romans to inform on early followers of Jesus. He was forced to move to Rome, the locals were baying for his blood. He was not a popular man after Jesus' death, the Romans rescued him and took him to Rome. 

And we ended up with the Church headed by him, not by John the Baptist, not by a council of the disciples, but by what history will judge as a pretty rotten guy.

When Emperor Constantine converted 250 years later, thats when the roots of the modern church really grew. We had the council of Nicea, the council of Constantinople - the dogma was made official. And again decisions were made with respect to previous ones. The church cant contradict itself or it will be seen to be fallible. 

I'm rambling now - but the gist of it all is that the church is very much man-made. I don't see the divinity in it. The rules are made by men, they are interpretations of allegorical stories, they're based on Iron age understandings. I know we had Vatican II etc, but Ratzinger and the Congregation of the Doctrine of the faith (which he led for decades) are very conservative, they see the value in keeping to the old ways. They dont see the value in adjusting to modern life, with modern people, who more understand their world.

I don't see such an organisation as being honest with themselves or us, I don't see them being honest with God. I do see them reminiscing for the power they had in the middle ages. For me the catholic church is corrupted and I don't reognise its legitimacy. It's not what Jesus would have envisioned his church to be. 

How does that grab you? :)

A common topic of discussion in forums like Stormfront is whether the Portuguese should be considered white or brown. 

A large portion of the Iberian peninsula was conquered by the Moors for many centuries. Their legacy can be seen today in Spanish architecture, language, and culture. The dark skinned Spaniards mentioned in the article are either the knights of Al-Andalus or the moors that were left in Spain, either in pure form or diluted with the general Spanish population, before most of them were expelled from the country after the reconquista.

And even today, if you venture far south enough to places like the Canary Islands you'll find Spaniards who are considered white by their own standards, brown by modern American standards, and who look just like the average non mulatto brown Cuban or Puerto Rican.",,1426455057,0,3,3

I'd have to disagree with that statement. More expats from the States are likely living in the UK than in Switzerland.",,1426455064,0,1,1
