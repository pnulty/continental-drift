t5_2qh2p,,1425930978,"I was taught that the germanic family of languages was completely different from the romance languages, which descended from Latin.

English is a mixture of both, which is why it's easy to speak a bit of it if you know any European language, but tough to master because of all the inconsistencies.

Take, for example, verb forms. In English we have both weak verms (indicate the preterit by a suffix: 'I smoke' / 'I smok**ed**') and strong verbs (preterite is indicated by a specific vowel change: 'I drink' / 'I dr**a**nk').

In French, there's no such thing as a ""strong"" verb (a germanic concept), so when you learn English in a French school, every verb is either ""regular"" (weak) or ""irregular"" (either weak or truly irregular like 'to be').

So they get pages of ""irregular verbs"" to learn off by heart when most of them are in fact regular, just not under any grammar rules they know. Learning lists of words like that sucks; most students lose interest and only remember a select few, what they really remember is that ""English has tons of irregular verbs"" which is complete bollocks.

And another thing. To call Gaza a concentration camp is disgustingly ignorant. We both know what happened in Europe in the 40's and we both know that's not being attempted in Israel.

You're in Europe (I assume due to your euro symbol). It's cheaper for you guys - yet your $12.50 is misleading. It's only for a half year or for new members.

As for IEEE Xplore, I confess I don't know. When I tried years ago, it didn't exist - although the transactions were available online to subscribers of those journals. Perhaps they allowed student access when they set it up. I never tried as the university had access anyway.

Two years getting an MS.

Second year into PhD, get locked out of student rates for IEEE.

Okay, so right off the bat, most of the history of the U.S. is clearly undemocratic.
Were we a 'democracy' when women and blacks couldn't vote? Was it 'democratic' to have slaves in the U.S.? And then after the right to vote was given to blacks, you have decades of Jim Crow Laws made with the intention of inhibiting blacks from voting. 'Democratic' that is not.

There are further tenets of 'democracy' that the U.S. does not follow. But it doesn't matter, does it? Could you ever accept how bad things are right now. Fear will keep your false hope from allowing you to see the obvious.

Socialism is not welfare, social security, unemployment public benefits, or ""infrastructure"" spending.

Socialism is a politico-economic system characterized by government ownership of the means of production.

Capitalism is a politico-economic system characterized by private ownership of the means of production.

Since Europe has both private ownership and government ownership, one cannot call Europe socialist or capitalist.  It is a mixed economy, like the US, Canada, Mexico, and Asia.

Venezuela is a country that is characterized by government ownership of the means of production for many industries.  Much more so than most other mixed economies.  Chavez is a socialist President, who has taken it upon himself to control the means of rice production, by sending his troops to the rice companies and coercing them into producing at levels Chavez wants.

A fully socialist country would entail businesses being threatened like this all the time, because the self-interest of producers will always differ from the self-interest of the government officials.

AFAIK Ireland did it first, and other (EU) countries have followed. Plastic bags used to be a major source of littering in Ireland. Like in the US, they used to be free with every purchase. The law that was then passed kept them legal, but made it uneconomical to give them away by requiring retailers to pay something in the area of 5 or ten cents (I don't recall the actual amount) per each plastic bag given to consumers. As expected, this caused retailers to charge consumers 10 ct per plastic bag, which in the minds of the general population made plastic bags less ""disposable"" and decreased littering. There also were many other positive knock-on effects, e.g. retailers made stronger, reusable plastic bags and people started reusing them, and more people started buying and using more durable reusable shopping bags, e.g. jute/burlap bags or ones made from cloth, and retailers started offering them. Some retailers offer free paper bags that are biodegradable (and those aren't taxed). Also, whereas before the plastic bag tax you'd be given a plastic bag automatically at the grocer's, whether you wanted one or not, staff now ask you. And yes, I personally observed a noticeable difference in terms of littering.

t5_2qh8e,,1425931716,"*""So much for prosperity.""* You're absolutely right. So much for prosperity. Specifically, so much for the prosperity of the ruling minority. This world, which is objectively and unavoidably split into classes, is incapable of providing prosperity and wealth to all. What we see today is prosperity and wealth in the hands of the few, while the many go starving, struggle to maintain living standards and so on. What Socialists and Communists aim to achieve, through the collective power of the whole of the working class, is to bring that prosperity to everyone equally.

*""Who dictates what is a 'need' and what is not?""* Good question. We do. Everyone does. A system based on need requires that needs be heard. More specifically, you cannot fulfill needs if those people who require things are not participating. (Which is in part why Capitalism does not have the motivation or the capacity to provide for everyone's needs.) Democratic organisation of society, organically, through the working class, the laboring class. That is, representative organisational bodies, who represent working class people, without bureacratic seperation. Who can be recalled at any time. In other words, everyone decides together, democratically, what should be produced and where it needs to go, through this rank and file representative organisation.

But to be really, really simple on that question, Karl Marx clarified it best. ""Be it the needs of the stomach, or needs of the mind."" In other words, what you need can be anything from basic subsistance (food, clothing, a house and so on), or things that you want solely for enjoyment (games, computers, televisions, funky furniture etc). The person who decides what you need is you.

*""No competition? So it is all just a bunch of monopolies?""* Not at all. Yes, there is a monopoly of wealth, but not a 'bunch of monopolies.' The monopoly of wealth we have today is a 'bunch of monopolies.' Monopolies which are being more and more concentrated and centralised amongst the bigger capitalists. From Rupert Murdoch to Richard Branson, their monopolies are growing, which means that for everyone else, wealth is decreasing. The monopoly of wealth under a Communist social organisation is in the hands of all, with equal share, equal say and equal rights to that monopoly. Simply put, everyone gets a piece of the cake, because the vast majority, the laboring class, is the one who created it.

""*What if I want to open my own business? Am I allowed?*"" There is no reason to say that you would not be able to open your own shop, providing a service that you enjoy and wish to provide to others. However, there is no basis for exploitation of labor, and therefore, no basis or objective ability to profit. That basically means, you'd do it for leisure, not to amass more wealth than everyone else.

One of the fundamentals of understanding capitalism is understanding the Labor theory of value, which, Marx was not the only theoretician to subscribe to. Many of the early economists agreed with this theory, it was only after the rise of the massive labor movement through Europe which announced ""Socialism!"" that the far right of Capitalism moved to distort and over-complicate how Capitalism actually works.

The Labor theory of Value is basically that Value is only created through the investment of Labor. For example: Capital does not create more capital on its own. Capital requires labor to create new value, new capital. Capitalism works on the basis of exploiting labor power, to create surplus value/profit. Actually here's a link that myself and several other contributors have tempered, in the hopes of simplifying it: http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism

Capitalism requires you to exploit the labor power of working people. Under communism, you would not be able to do so, because you would have no further right over the means of production than anyone else.

*""Who dictates what I can produce, and how much I can sell it for?""* Again, you would dictate what it is that you wish to produce. Of course, in a cooperative society, you would also be able to decide that with your peers, with your fellow human beings if you so chose. You however, would have no ability to sell your product. There is no material basis for you to be able to do so, and since profit is impossible, sale becomes merely production. You would produce for your own leisure, not to amass wealth above others.

Of course, being able to trade your commodities for other commodities (barter) will always exist, usefulness for usefulness, however, much less trade would be required, as there is no reason for anything to have a price.

I think that all of what I just said seems like an elaborate pipe-dream to many people. And that is understandable, given that Capitalism is placed on a pedastal as being, ""The end of history..."" However, if anything, Capitalism has shown that it most certainly isn't. That time and time again, even from the very start of Capitalism, there was resistance to it. The 19th and 20th centuries have been rife with resistance, from the Chartists of the 1840s, to the Labor movement of the late 19th century, to the Socialist movement during the early 20th century (which saw multiple working class revolutions, however, only one succeeded - though only for a brief time - the Russian revolution). The massive revolts of 1968 and so on. The 21st century is no different. With two governments already crumbling under mass public action (Latvia and Iceland), with millions coming out in protest against the attack on Gaza, with the massive public outcry in Greece and so on.

Even in Australia, there has been mass resistance. How do you think the Labor Party was formed?

People show day in and day out that Capitalism is a phase that we are going through. And people are being tempered, and sometimes forced to remember the lessons of the past struggles against it. People show time and time again, when they move into mass revolutionary action they can organise themselves democratically, to oppose the system. In every working class revolution, workers have organised themselves in the way that I had described above. They began to occupy factories and produce for their needs, for the needs of the people around them etc. They began to work consciously as a collective. (As opposed to the unconscios collectivity that people are forced to work in under Capitalism.)

All of what I described is very possible, especially when time and time again the market forces prove their inadequacy, when time and time again, Capitalism fails to provide for all, and time and time again, Capitalism leads itself into crisis.",,t1_c07zhp3,False,,t1_c07zgab,0,1,c07zhp3,australia,0,True,1,0,t3_816mp,[deleted],1236006432,False

t5_2cneq,,1425931791,"You know why the United States doesn't have universal health care?

BECAUSE WE'RE NOT FUCKING SOCIALIST! What don't you understand????????????????

I'm sorry, but people DO NOT inherently have a right to health care. A person who gorges themselves until they weigh 500 pounds DOES NOT have a right to health care if they can't pay for it themselves. A person who has drank alcohol until they have liver problems and need to go to the doctor DOES NOT have a right to health care. Irresponsible people should NOT be allowed to go to the doctor on MY dime. Children and the elderly

What needs to happen is a complete overhaul of the health care system that we already have, which includes removing the catering to the pharmaceutical companies and removing drug ads from television. They have no business being there in the first place for the same reason cigarette ads shouldn't be there and the same reason alcohol ads shouldn't be there.  Most people aren't doctors, so if you have to have a prescription to get it, you shouldn't be allowed to ""pre-diagnose"" yourself by watching a fucking commercial. 

Take away the right of a corporation to lobby. Period. Corporations like pharmaceutical companies are not human beings and they don't have rights. That's one of the big parts of the problem with the government in the United States and in any other country. What's there not to understand? Corporations are out to make money, that's what they're supposed to do. Corporations are legally bound to make a profit. They do not have your best interests at heart, only their pocketbook. Since corporations aren't people, they shouldn't be allowed to lobby. Get it? But, this won't ever happen because stupid people like you would rather get as free of a ride as you can get instead of fixing the real problem so it's easier on everyone. 

The only people who have a right to healthcare are the people who take care of themselves or have the ability to pay for it. Our constitution provides for the right to life, liberty, and the PURSUIT of happiness. That doesn't mean you have a RIGHT to happiness. You don't have a right to happiness. You really don't, regardless of what Obama and all the other socialist propaganda-scarfing people here think. The systems overseas are not superior to ours because those people have traded out freedoms in order to be able to have that free health care. 

Another part of the problem is the morality of modern people. People would sooner throw their parents into a nursing home than make room in their homes to take care of them. Every major religion on the planet says for you to take care of your parents! Seeing as atheism is on the rise, the slump in basic morality really doesn't surprise me.

We don't need more government control over our lives. You people (talking to other Reddit viewers here) over in Europe and everywhere else may be happy with it, but we hopped across the pond to get away from tyrants and your idea of ""security"" hundreds of years ago. If you're in the US and you want that system, why don't you hop BACK across the pond you or your ancestors came from and stick it out there? Socialists in the US can go be socialist in a country that's already socialist... like Britain. There are plenty of socialist countries, you keep talking about how great they are, so why don't you go live over there..? Oh, I know... the standard of living is LOWER!  Less room, more crowded... you'll pay 3 times as much for a home in 'Great' Britain or Germany than you will in the United States AND you'll get less square footage! Gas evens out in Britain to what..? $10US a gallon?  It's $2 here and I'm lovin' it.  And you can say what you want to about the greatness of using less gas because things are closer together, but when the riots start over the financial crisis, they're not going to like being so close to ""everything"". Let's see what their standard of living goes to, then.

You can have your overcrowded, camera-surveilled, 'free' healthcare providing socialist countries, and I'll keep my land of the free and home of the brave.

There would be more than enough money for the United States to pay for free health care for all people if Congress would manage their money right instead of adding in so much pork into bills for their little ""private projects"" all the fucking time. Nobody'd have to pay for anything having to do with healthcare out of pocket! It's not so much a problem with our healthcare as it is with a problem with our overall government. You don't take from the rich to give to the poor and you don't take from the poor to give to the rich; meaning, you don't take money out of my pocket to give to someone who takes advantage of the system and you don't take money from a poor person to give it to a fatcat rich fucker that takes advantage of the system, either.

To fix health care, the ENTIRE GOVERNMENT needs to be overhauled. And the answer isn't socialism. People need to get back to a community mindset and take care of EACH OTHER instead of relying on the government to fix the problem... government NEVER fixes problems, they create them. If there were no problems, politicians would be out of a job. Where do you think all these problems we have came from? Politicians trying to FIX things. Less government, more morality, more personal responsibility is what people need, NOT another government program. People used to take care of each other; let's get back to that and leave the government out of it, please. Oh, I'm sorry, we can't do that, because the government won't give back powers they've already taken from us... because people like you have let them. Nevermind.

t5_2cneq,,1425931793,"It depends on the 'intervention' and the 'quality.' In general, American healthcare  is of far greater quality than that of Europe or Canada, It's just far more expensive than either. Europeans and Canadians who can afford it will generally opt for American treatment, when available.

Part of the reason for this is that standards are so stringent: people simply are not allowed to purchase healthcare below a certain level of quality. Also, government subsidies drive up prices by guaranteeing that overpriced healthcare will always have a market. More so, rich people have a lot to spend on healthcare and poor people not so much. Buying roughly the same products allows the providers to charge more because the wealthy can afford it and ignore the poor demographic. Since charging different prices to different income brackets is largely illegal, this means that the companies make the most money by providing to the wealthy at higher cost than to everybody at lower cost.

One kind of solution to this problem is the so called 'socialist' single-payer system in which everybody is forced to use the same insurance plan. This reduces demand (in the economic sense of the word,) and lowers price consequentially. It also threatens to lower the quality as hospitals and providers will be forced to do with significantly reduced funding and market competition in the American healthcare market will be greatly reduced.

There is also the solution of reducing standards and subsidies in America and allow providers to offer lesser quality services to people of poorer income brackets. This will create a variety of healthcare services available, allowing people with less money to pay less and receive reduced quality service. This would allow the market to more properly function and would likely be the cheapest solution over all. The poor would to worse in this system than a single payer system, but better than in the current system. The rich would do better than either. The only people to hurt would be the insurance companies and the HMOs.

t5_2qh1n,,1425931884,"Your info is a little out-of-date. First of all, in many cases it doesn't even matter if a GM crop cross-pollinates with nearby relatives if the trait is benign. For example, a crop engineered to have higher vitamin A content (like Golden Rice), should that gene get transferred, wouldn't destabilize an ecosystem like the transfer of a gene for pest resistance would.

And second, there are many ways of controlling gene transfer, if it is unwanted. Crops can be made to not reproduce, eliminating the threat of genetic contamination. And before you cry out that this would enslave farmers, forcing them to buy new GM seed every year, keep in mind that *most farmers in Europe and the United States, as well as many commercial farmers elsewhere* already buy new seed every year. Seed-saving is a thing of the past. The reason is that new seed is certified seed, and has higher yield than saved seed. It is also less susceptible to disease. Apple farmers for example, *can't* use saved seed because the seeds they get from the apples they grow can turn into wildly different types of apple trees. Certified seeds enable them to grow the same product each season. Also, there's technology called ""gene-deletion,"" in which we can create genetically modified crops that can have the transgenes “deleted” from the genetic code with the addition of a promoter to the crop. This means that GM corn could be grown, and then all transgenes could be removed from specific parts of the plant, such as the pollen or the edible part. This could eliminate the risk of gene flow and of potential negative health effects of consuming transgenes. [Source](http://gene-deletor.net/GDTT.aspx)

&gt;
&gt;Its ragged coastline has been a haven for South American cartels seeking new routes to Europe.
&gt;
&gt;Analysts said yesterday that the death of General Na Waie bore the hallmarks of an attack by drug cartels.
&gt;
&gt;There are fears that the instability might spread beyond the rundown capital. “This is a very bad situation,” said Richard Moncrieff, the West Africa project director at the International Crisis Group. “There is now a power vacuum.”

t5_2qh61,,1425932078,"Ok. Time out. Sorry. I know it's badly off topic. But I'm sick of hearing the same “stop giving money to other countries” and similar comments that spring directly from a profound ignorance of the way the United States operates around the world. The US government never, never, never give money for free or by pure compassion. Individuals may. But never does the US government. 

This one “gives” money away in order to buy interests, invest in foreign “friends” so our corporations can either plow, drill, or suck dry foreign lands and ""main d'oeuvre"" for corporations's own profits (not the American tax-payer, of course!).

American food surpluses inundate the third world countries for the last 30 years as to crush their farming jobs, so their folks get forced to abandon their land and move toward cities where US owned producing plants await for them. No wonder that the first reflex of stupid communist r""revolution"" is to close plants and move folks back to the fields. It's just a reflex after years of corporate enslavement hidden under the false promise of a capitalism fair and equitable to everyone.

For example: The money that is “given” to Africans dictators so we can drill at will, while western pharmaceutics are invited to test their lethal shit to African kids and other poor African bastards.

I saw first hand your “help” in Tchad, when I was fighting for some European Army. I saw the US drop their pallets of dry milk in the middle of dried Sahara. (!) (and always dropping them in the middle of a crowd too, as a few always die crushed under the heavy pallets, I can see those pilots laughing their asses off) I saw dozens of kids died choking on that shit when their mothers thought that this was edible as such. The Americans never, ever, come investigate the need of the folks on the ground. The US “Aid” drops also daily pallets of drugs. Sure. But all used up, way old and often without any labels on them. 

I can write a fucking book about your “aid”. I invite you to read, “Confessions of an Economic Hit Man”, by John Perkins. This will give you a start in the understanding of that great charity and compassion from the US...

1. Hygiene so your kitchen does not get closed down. 
2. How to save money by not throwing away food, drink, etc.
3. How to deal with chefs, they are a very strange group, mostly on one drug or another.
6. Your staff will steal from you. I guarantee it, and in a restaurant you can stock take every day but fresh produce is hard to count. (How much salad is in a salad?)
4. How long it takes to get started every day, and how much time it takes to close, there is a lot of cleaning every day.
5. General good practice dealing with customers and staff and daily routines. You need a routine for *everything* and will easily spend 12+ hours a day just ""sorting things out"".
7. Make a plan for hiring out the whole place for parties of more than x-many people. Include rental costs and staff costs, then offer menus based on cost and stick to that cost. You need to make money.
8. The customer is not always right, if they were all the food would be free and the staff would have one table each. Good service is not about bowing and kissing ass. 
9. Learn how to make proper espresso, I never go back to a place that had good food but awful coffee. But then I was a barista for a good while and properly trained too.

If you have never done it, I strongly advise not doing it for yourself.  You couldn't pick an easier trade to lose money in. It is hard work and long hours.  I know chefs that owned their own place successfully but they had no life outside of the place and eventually just quit running their own place for an easier job. I worked in the trade for 7 years, quit because it ruined my health. There is a lot of stress and heavy lifting!

Equipment: get used dishwasher, oven, cooker espresso machine etc. Fridges and freezers just need to work, nobody will ever see them, you do not need new.  

As you are n the US it might be different than in Europe where smiling is not always an indication of good service. I hate in the US that waiters constantly interrupt the meal to ask if everything is ok. If it isn't, we'll get *your* attention.

Let's say the average person works around 30 hours a week at their minimum wage paid job next year. I'm estimating that, after taxes, they will make an effective 9.50 an hour.

30 x 9.50 = 285 a week. 570 a biweekly pay check, and 1040 dollars a month except for that one, glorious month per year that works out to have 3 paycheques a month.

On average though, 1,040 a month.

In my area, which is not a very nice area but it's not bad either, the cost of the average bachelor apartment is 600-700 a month. For a one bedroom you're looking at 750-850. And a two bedroom it's going to be at least 950, with some going up as high as 1,200 dollars.

Most people in a two bedroom will have two incomes, but not all families can afford that luxury. People on minimum wage would be left with very little left over for food and other bills.

One bedroom people would have a few hundred left over to pay the other bills, with maybe a hundred bucks or so left to save up or buy a few luxuries (a night out, once a month, or a movie).

This is only going to get worse as the minimum wage is effectively lower each year that it doesn't get raised due to inflation and gradually rising prices.

To rise that employee's wage by a dollar every year, for the 30 hours a week he works every week, it would cost 1,560 extra dollars a year, and now that we've broken the 10 dollar barrier for minimum wage, a dollar increase wouldn't be 10%. We're getting close to it not being upkeep enough to offset the 7% inflation rate per year.

Several other countries have a minimum wage that's significantly higher than ours. They're mostly in Europe and they seem to be doing just fine. I don't hear about mass unemployment.

Where did I say it should?

&gt; $10.5 is more than needed to ""get by"", especially given that health and education is paid for by the government.

Where in Canada are you that university is paid for by the government? Do you know that to get a job that pays more than minimum wage you either need several years of experience, a university degree, or both? You are aware that a highschool education means absolutely nothing to the work world, right?

And yes, healthcare is mostly covered. But god forbid if you need some dental work, or if you need major surgery that makes it so you can't work for months, because $10.5 that's ""just getting by"" will diminish in a few months even after years of saving.

Medication is also not covered, so you better hope that if you do get sick that the pills you need are the cheap kind.


&gt; Instead it should reflect the current market and cost of living.

I agree. My argument is that right now it's not equal to the current market. More math for you. Straight from York University's website:

Full-time tuition for most non-professional programs (5 courses) + compulsory supplementary fees*

$5,524

That's the cheapest type of course. It does not include parking, transportation. It does not include residency or meal plans if you need to stay at the university for whatever reason. There's word that these prices are going up by 25% but let's just go with that number $5,500.

Let's take an example of 40 hours a week of working at minimum wage, dropped down again for taxes to 9.50 an hour (and that's NEXT YEAR, not this year).

40 x 9.5 = 380 a week.

380 x 52 = 19,760 a year. Let's bump that up to 20,000 to make the math easier.

Our example also lives in a one bedroom apartment. I estimated 750-850 in my previous post so let's go with 800 that's smack in the middle.

800 x 12 = 9,600 a year on rent.

Paying for a car on this wage would be impossible with insurance, car payments, and gas prices, so let's go with public transportation. A Metro Pass in Toronto costs 110 dollars a month.

110 x 12 = 1,320

There's also phone and internet costs. TV too if you want that sort of thing, and a cell phone on top of that. Those are optional though, so let's go with an average of the 4 and say around 70 dollars a month.

70 x 12 = 840 a year.

Food is a necessity. If you're living alone you can get by with 100-200 a month on food if you don't mind cheap stuff that's not that great for you. Middle value again: 150.

150 x 12 = 1800 a year.

Let's total that so far:

9,600 + 1,320 + 840 + 1800 = 13,560.

And that's with NO ALCOHOL, NO NIGHTS OUT, NO DATES, NO GOING OUT FOR DINNER, NO LUXURIES at all, which is hardly living but this is an extreme example. Feel free to knock around 2000 onto that total if you want to imagine this minimum wage worker is allowed to have some fun.

20,000 - 13,560 = 6,400.

So a year's worth of saving every penny that isn't a necessary cost equals 6,400 dollars saved in the bank. So it'll take four years to be able to afford the full 4-year course of education according to York U's website to get a degree to get out of minimum wage. This isn't including, of course, the costs of being able to go to University and taking courses while working. You can't work as much often if you have to go to school!

Rapid inflation in most of Europe, but most notably Germany.  Jobless rates in Europe during the Great Depression around 30%.  In the US it capped at 25%ish.  However, notably, in Germany the rapid inflation with very high unemployment and a weak government meant it was fairly easy to Hitler to take over.  

Let's also not forget that the complexities of the time were they had no idea how long the Depression would last.  When unemployment finally capped in (IIRC) 1934, most of the damage was done in Europe.  Most Americans imagine America during the Great Depression, but rarely do they remember Germany.  I think this image says it all:

In the 1920's in Germany there was Hyperinflation:

Then coupled with the Great Depression (Deflation), the Germans got fairly well screwed.  

So while the Treaty did a number on the Germans (causing some of the Hyperinflation), it was exacerbated by the deflation of the 30's.  Let's also not forget that most of the world (save for some of Asia, specifically Japan) were being crushed by debt and deflation.

by [tom s](http://flickr.com/photos/tomspender)
&gt; Nice rant - but way off the mark. Here’s the point: Dubai is not a “business idea” - it's a real place full of real people. The reason it is as it is is precisely BECAUSE there is no oil. If Dubai had unlimited oil it could sit back and be Saudi Arabia. Instead, it has successfully diversified away from oil in a daring and existentially vital bid to get to a point where they don;t rely on oil revenues at all. As a result, it has developed a western-style economy which is totally screwed now in the same way as credit-card economies like the US/UK etc.

&gt;There’s plenty of vice in Dubai, even if it is rather charmless (as I imagine it is in Vegas). Every hotel has a bar full of Chinese/Djiboutian/Ukranian hookers, while the Moroccans, Syrians and Iranians are preferred by the rich Arabs and so have a higher status. There is also plenty of booze (although not much harder drugs). The key to understanding the place is to read between the lines rather than taking the letter of the law. The code of conduct is basically “do what you want - anything at all - but just don’t shout about it”. There are rules about what you do in public, but what you do in the privacy of your own home is between you and your conscience.

&gt;While westerners are pretty visible in Dubai and tend to be the main preoccupation of other westerners abroad (like the writer of this blog), Dubai is in fact vital for millions of other people in a region of pathetically badly-run countries. It offers jobs and opportunity to Arabs from economic basket cases like Egypt, Syria and the Occupied Palestinian Territories as well as loads of Indians and Pakistanis and an investment environment which, while incredibly opaque, is far less risky than home - places like Iraq, Iran, Uzbekistan or Ukraine. The place is also a vital node on the global transport map between Europe and Asia. Westerners may well leave, especially if the place introduces tax, but that doesn’t mean Dubai is dead. Far from it.

&gt;Dubai may not boast Parisian sophistication, and its own hubris has set it up as a target for opprobrium now things aren’t going so well, but I am still getting quite sick of all this nasty schadenfreude by western journalists who show up in Dubai, do an open-top bus tour for a couple of hours, and sneer that the place is a shithole and a “bad business idea”. It is not charming, but it has broken the pervasive Arab taboo of not achieving anything at all and for that it deserves recognition. And I can’t help feeling that it is exactly that that makes some foreign commentators uncomfortable.

Not true. Read 'The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution'. 

Also, consider the Ashkenazi Jews, who average above any other group on IQ. This arose through selection over a relatively short period of time. 

G. Cochran, J. Hardy, H. Harpending, Natural History of Ashkenazi Intelligence, Journal of Biosocial Science 38 (5), pp. 659–693 (2006). http://homepage.mac.com/harpend/.Public/AshkenaziIQ.jbiosocsci.pdf

There are readily identifiable clusters of points, corresponding to traditional continental ethnic groups: Europeans, Africans, Asians, Native Americans, etc. (See, for example, Risch et al., Am. J. Hum. Genet. 76:268–275, 2005.) ...

We see that there can be dramatic group differences in phenotypes even if there is complete allele overlap between two groups - as long as the frequency or probability distributions are distinct. But it is these distributions that are measured by the metric we defined earlier. Two groups that form distinct clusters are likely to exhibit different frequency distributions over various genes, leading to group differences.

This leads us to two very distinct possibilities in human genetic variation:

Hypothesis 1: (the PC mantra) The only group differences that exist between the clusters (races) are innocuous and superficial, for example related to skin color, hair color, body type, etc.

Hypothesis 2: (the dangerous one) Group differences exist which might affect important (let us say, deep rather than superficial) and measurable characteristics, such as cognitive abilities, personality, athletic prowess, etc. 

Note H1 is under constant revision, as new genetically driven group differences (e.g., particularly in disease resistance) are being discovered. According to the mantra of H1 these must all (by definition) be superficial differences.

A standard argument against H2 is that the 50k years during which groups have been separated is not long enough for differential natural selection to cause any group differences in deep characteristics. I find this argument quite naive, given what we know about animal breeding and how evolution has affected the (ever expanding list of) ""superficial"" characteristics. Many genes are now suspected of having been subject to strong selection over timescales of order 5k years or less. For further discussion of H2 by Steve Pinker, see here.

The predominant view among social scientists is that H1 is obviously correct and H2 obviously false. However, this is mainly wishful thinking. Official statements by the American Sociological Association and the American Anthropological Association even endorse the view that race is not a valid biological concept, which is clearly incorrect.

Are you fucking kidding me?  *We already live in an economy of scarcity*.  ***WE HAVE SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME.***

&gt; but you're much too content with the socio-political/philosophical status quo.

Hardly.  I am a rabid proponent of liberalizing the markets and eliminating government subsidies and sponsorships of large corporations.  I am a radical proponent of FOSS softwares and technologies.  Such as RepRap.

&gt; It's 100% sustainable. 

I'm glad you believe that.  I can spot at least a half dozen flaws in your ideology -- not the least of which that it will simply never come to pass.

As to hierarchies and technology being a ""baaaaad combination"" -- that too hasn't panned out in reality.  Now, we can discuss BCI in terms of early adopters and psychological manipulation -- and believe me, **I have** -- but the fact of the matter is that this has little proper place in this conversation (and the answer to that one lies in vigorous FOSS softwares and technologies.  Sounds recursive, no?)

&gt; You seem to think there is no ill will on the part of the more privileged (whether intentional or out of neglect) and no suffering on the part of the less privileged.

Not even remotely suggested by what I stated. I simply pointed out physical facts; you respond with philosophy.  No place in the conversation, I'm afraid, for philosophies.  Only realities.

&gt; The have-nots are going to start becoming haves. What's the first thing people do once they become materially secure? They have kids.

That statement is not backed by the reality of the declining fertility rate in post-industrial societies.  The only reason that we continue to exceed the population replacement rate in America and Europe is due to immigration.  Second-generation immigrants fall back to the negative population growth totals.  The first thing they do may be to have kids -- but they were already doing that.  The first thing those kids do, however, is to **not have kids**.

&gt; A revolution in energy and materials technology is a baby boom. 

Not supported by the facts.  I refer you again to the fertility rates in post-industrial societies.  This is a global trend.

&gt; But, yet, we're expanding the definition of urban centers to connote city limits.

And yet, the global population density continues to expand, as entire regions go fallow.

&gt; We need to be condensing our cities even more, and tearing down everything on the outer edges.

That's coming.  The revolution in construction materials will see to it.

&gt; As far as I know there's only one vertical farm building in the works in Las Vegas. I haven't heard of any others.

Dubais.  These things come as they come; first with a few early adopters (the ""haves"") and then widespread adoption once the technologies become proven (to the ""have-nots"")

&gt; This means we're still importing everything. 

To cities, yes.  The US remains the world's largest net exporter of foodstuffs.  

&gt; The main thing is we have to get away from this thinking where we're constantly asking ""how much can I get away with?"" and start asking ""what's the right thing to do?"" Fear of punishment has to cease to be our motivator.

And the easiest, most guaranteed way to make that happen is to grant private rights to all commons.  As I illustrated.

&gt; Don't you think that there will soon be a technology that comes along that gives the privileged so much of an upper hand (genetic engineering, maybe, or AI) that it just obliterates things for the have-nots?

No.  A thousand times, no.  Economics is not a zero-sum game.  If we genetically engineer all the top 10% earners of society into being geniuses, exactly what do you think those geniuses will be doing with their newfound intellect?  It took *one* relatively bright physicist to create a cheap wood-stove for the women of Darfur and now that man is considered a hero to that population.  Why?  Because he cut the fuel costs and labor intensivity for those with the stoves literally to a third of what it otherwise was.  (Not to mention reduced the probability of rape and death for those women as he cut their wood-scavenging down to 1/3 what it was).  And that's just one guy.  Right now you could say that .01% of our population (going off of IQ scores) is in the league of that guy.  What do you think would happen if only 1% of the 1000% increase in geniuses decided to ""do something for the poor""? (Anthropy amongst the wealthy is actually much, much more frequent.  Bill Gates for example spends 50% of his income on anthropic gestures.)  That would be a 100-fold increase in the ""genius"" spent on the poor.

&gt; I am a rabid proponent of liberalizing the markets and eliminating government subsidies and sponsorships of large corporations.

Liberalizing the markets? OK, it's good to take away the benefits being given to corporations, but you need to redirect them to the working/middle classes. 

&gt; I can spot at least a half dozen flaws in your ideology -- not the least of which that it will simply never come to pass.

It's already coming to pass in many ways. If given more positive liberty in the future chances are better that it will come to pass. Like I said, I'm going to work on it for a couple years. It's a pretty good system, and I doubt you see any flaws.

&gt; Not even remotely suggested by what I stated. I simply pointed out physical facts; you respond with philosophy. No place in the conversation, I'm afraid, for philosophies. Only realities.

Whenever philosophies are flawed there is always a place for philosophy as a topic of conversation. It's a reality that hierarchies are unsustainable. It's not a philosophy, IConrad.

The only reason that we continue to exceed the population replacement rate in America and Europe is due to immigration.

Haha, I didn't say people native to post-industrial societies experience population explosions. I said that newcomers to a lack of lack experience population explosions for this very reason. Who cares what their kids do? One generation could be catastrophic short of any focus on population limitation advocacy. 

&gt; as entire regions go fallow.

Regions go fallow? Just because people aren't living there that doesn't mean that land isn't being used/exploited. Cities depend on the importation of resources. If anything, people moving to cities is *worse* for rural areas. 

&gt; To cities, yes.

Yes, to cities. FROM RURAL AREAS.

t5_2qtp5,,1425933161,"Well considering they aren't competent enough to run *any* kind of office I really don't think giving them more money will solve the problem. I think what he's probably referring to is the instances of abuse in countries that aren't as westernized as the US and Europe. For example the abuse going on in parts of Africa due to conflicts there. Here's a BBC news story from '04:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3549325.stm

And another: http://village.africanpath.com/profiles/blogs/prevalence-of-rape-in-e-congo

One more:http://select.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/opinion/12kristof.html?_r=1

He's also probably referring to things like honor killings in the Middle East as well. But in looking at those articles that I linked, you can tell that there is a much MUCH bigger underlying problem in that part of the world that is leading to the abuse and rape of many people.

Its quite odd, I think, to be so focused on the abuse going on, but not on the cause. The abuse and rape in Africa is going on more I think to shame the survivors left in the village, to demoralize and scare them as a tactic more than abuse because these people have anger issues. And in the Mid East it's also a really touchy issue because so much of what spurs the abuse of people there is religiously based. I'm not really up to speed in regards to the rest of the world unfortunately. 

This is an issue that needs to be worked out on both sides of the spectrum, with both the abused and the abusers. However, in cases like the Mid East, you're dealing with religion and we have to decide if the need to be PC outweighs the need to protect people. The UN has already made it pretty clear where they stand in terms of criticizing religion, so I don't expect much to come from them on that front. And sending peacekeepers and setting up women's shelters aren't going to be of much help either. In places like Africa, unless you stop the violence going on there you're pretty much giving the militants there a prime spot to terrorize people again and again.

I have to wonder about the emotional and mental damage of the men in the Mid East who are told to beat or kill their significant others or relatives because of some centuries old, out-dated cultural law. I'm not sure what the penalty is for not being able to dole out that kind of punishment, but it can't be good. Men just aren't doing this because its fun. Its a cultural hard wire, passed on for generations and any deviations are quickly dealt with.

The UN will never stop the humanitarian atrocities going on if it keeps approaching problems like this.

Also note that the style and form of CV depends on where you're applying. You don't say where you are, so I assume you're American.

t5_2qh1n,,1425933414,"I voted this up but I want to discuss a few things.
I am president of the Palm Beach County Beekeepers Association. I have been in beekeeping for 5 years. 

The article tries to pin the long term decline on Varroa, Almond farmers, and CCD. This is like abusing your child and then blaming everyone else.

Commercial beekeepers usually make their money off of pollination not honey. While buying local honey is a great idea. Usually you cannot and if you do you are buying it from someone who is a hobbiest beekeeper. So you won't find it in stores. I sell mine on craiglist and usually sell out very quickly.

Hobbiest are quickly becoming the backbone of the beekeeping industry. If you have a 1000 hives and lose half to disease or pests you are facing bankruptcy. If you are a small time beekeeper with a couple of hives and lose one your hobby isn't likely to bankrupt you.Here is the surprising thing. Hobbiest in my view are not having the issues that commercial beekeepers are having. Why? Because they dont deal with the issues that commercial beekeepers deal with. 

Most hobbiest don't use harsh chemicals on their hives. Most don't haul their hives from one side of the country to the other stressing out their bees. The lure of almond pollination fees can be great to a commercial beekeeper. To a hobbiest who isn't in it for the money the lure of having to haul bees across the country and busting their butt like that. Well then the money doesn't hold so much appeal. 

When the Varroa came into the country the industry made a knee jerk reaction and turned beekeepers into pest control operators. Pouring chemical after chemical into their hives to a point where Varroa became immune to many of the treatments out there. Most hobbiest don't use chemicals on their hives. I understand commercial beekeepers looking to protect their industry this is how they feed their families. However instead of looking for a long term chemical free solution they just went from one product to the next. Now the wax foundation most beekeepers purchase contains those chemicals. 

The industry has foundation with cell sizes that are not natural. These larger cells in the comb allow Varroa to get in and destroy hives. Hobbiest can afford to go with small cell or foundationless frames because it won't cost them a fortune. Commercial beekeepers would have to make a very painful leap to do this to all of their hives. However between what they pay for treatments and loses in their hive production I think they could do it. 

The industry feeds High Fructose Corn Syrup to build up their hives in order to have the hive be populated enough to do pollination. While there is no peer reviewed research. The HFCS appears to be a factor in bee immune systems and health. Most hobbiest feed sugar water or actual honey to their bees to build them up. Some feed nothing and let the bees make or break on their own. The result is they have bees that are stronger. 

Commercial beekeepers buy queens in the hundreds. Some even requeen every year. This is an expensive process that has also resulted in one other scary issue. Inbreeding. Current genetics on bees show that European honeybees (the most common type in the US) are suffering from a lack of diversity in their genetics. This has also been shown to have compromised their immune system. 

The beekeeping industry right now is under going a huge transformation and that transformation in many areas is painful. It is going to get more painful. It is having an effect on the price of food and health care products. 1/3 of everything we eat comes from pollination. Almost all forms of make up contain beeswax as an ingredient. In the US the wax is so bad that the cosmetics industry usually does not buy their wax from US beekeepers. 

I recently held the Southeast Organic Beekeepers Conference. Speakers like Dee Lusby, Michael Bush, Dean Stigitz and Ramona Herboldsheimer pointed out many of the issues the industry is facing. So while the numbers may not lie. The article makes jumps to it's conclusions. 

The commercial beekeeping industry is going have to change. In some ways change back to how they use to keep bees prior to the Varroa invasion. My concern is that they will make another knee jerk reaction to CCD like they did the Varroa issue and just about destroy the industry. Commercial beekeepers are not evil they are in many ways some of the best assets the agriculture industry has. They put everything on the line for their job. Many of them simply want and need a better set of answers than they have been getting. Also many of them are going to have make big expensive changes. 

So please support your local beekeeper. Realize that you probably need to go to a green market or similar to get honey from your local beekeeper. Because the grocery store doesn't have his honey. Local raw untreated honey that hasn't been overheated. You would be amazed as to how different it tastes.

Yes, there are problems here in Ireland, but they are being addressed.

Since about 1994, Ireland has been expanding at about 6% p.a., and after the hairshirt years of the 80's, we lost the run of ourselves a bit. 

Our new-found wealth was badly mismanaged by the government, who hired far too many civil servants during that time (some 120-150,000), and paid them and themselves too much for what they were doing. 

An average public sector worker cannot be sacked, has a defined benefit pension (their pension is based on their final salary), and is earning 40% more than the average industrial wage, while our prime minister is earning more than Barrack Obama, and can still have outside interests.
 
Bad planning laws led to an initial scarcity of land to build on and was primarily responsible for the huge boom in housing prices that ensued. Our financial regulator was completely asleep at the wheel during all this, which led to some people being given loans to buy houses that were 10-12 times their salary. There was also a huge over-reliance on Foreign Direct Investment, to the detriment of entrepreneurs at home.
 
To date, house prices are roughly 25% off their peak, and about 1000 jobs a day are being lost in the private sector, and our budget deficit will likely be 6% of GDP, even with the upcoming mini-budget in April.

However, we still continue to export more than we import, our demographic profile is on the young side, prices of everything are falling (we were the second most expensive nation on earth), we have an open economy, and so far, we're holding onto the higher value added jobs that were created in pharmaceuticals, computers and finance, albeit mostly by foreign firms.

The key to recovery, IMV, is to lose public sector workers, primarily bureaucrats, and to close down a lot of the 800 quangos that were formed during the boom. Losing the bureaucrats should be done by offering them early retirement, rather than redundancy.

t5_6,,1425933582,"There are a few key reasons why marijuana and prostitution are not the same, hence the lack of calls for legalizing prostitution.  

First of all, America doesn't have ridiculous prostitution laws that fill up prisons.  We don't have a 'war on sex' that causes huge problem for numerous Latin American countries, as well as imprisoning large segments of impoverished society.

Second, there's nothing equivalently legal to prostitution.  Reasonably. tobacco and alcohol provide pretty compelling arguments for why marijuana should be legalized.  The same isn't really true for hookers.

Third, and probably most importantly, legalized prostitution hasn't really been shown to work.  Take Amsterdam as an example.  Everything that was supposed to happen when prostitution was legalized (the elimination of pimps, the end to human trafficking, the loss of power for organized crime) hasn't happened, and in some cases has gotten worse.  There have been a few studies recently (none of which I can pull up right now) that have shown that a large portion of the girls working in Amsterdam brothels are illegal, either from Eastern Europe or somewhere else.  

Maybe it would be different if all of America legalized prostitution so that no one place became a hotspot for sex tourism and the ill-effects that come with it, but that seems pretty unrealistic.  Moreover, the idea that prostitution is a victimless crime is pretty absurd.  Almost all prostitutes are forced into working through desperation, and while theoretically legalization removes the coercive elements, that hasn't really been proven to be true.",,t1_c082xuo,False,,t3_82ohm,0,7,c082xuo,reddit.com,0,True,7,0,t3_82ohm,bat-mite,1236388855,False
t5_6,,1425933598,"&gt; hat are people's thoughts on self-mutilation, for example?

On this example, specifically, it's a mental health problem, not a criminal one.

I can appreciate the argument that ""victimless"" does include some gray area... but there is a considerable black and white area that really ought to be addressed.

The fact is, prostitution prohibition renders illegal paying for something that's perfectly *legal* to give away for free. I can go to a bar, meet a chick, bring her home and have sex and be in the clear. But the same thing where I put a dollar in her purse after the deed is done, I'm breaking the law. There's nothing gray about it; it's flat out absurd.

&gt; The prostitutes there who are diseased, addicts, poor, ugly, or otherwise cannot get a license, migrate to other countries.

Well, there's a few issues to think about here.

First, this doesn't characterize all prostitutes. I can't begin to guess relative numbers - but there's a huge swath of the profession that consists of suburban housewives and girls paying their way through college, at rates around $300/hr, judging by Craigslist ads. If anyone is being ""victimized"" here it's their clients - again, this seems very black and white to me, and firmly in the ""not criminal"" column.

As a complete side note, this is part of the reason there's not a big push for prostitution legalization - escort agencies already operate as quasi-legitimate businesses, and prostitutes already pay taxes on their income - or at least to the degree that anyone being paid under the table reports their whole income. They just lie about the source of it - they claim ""self employment"" or something like that.

Of far greater moral concern are the streetwalkers - frequently runaways who fell in with a pimp and are perpetually indebted to him. On the even more horrific side of this you see what is effectively a new slave trade - girls from third world countries who are promised a job in America/Europe, and are effectively kidnapped and forced into sex work.

That's another black and white type thing, though on the opposite side - that's *certainly* something we should seek to abolish as a society. But then the question becomes, is a prohibition on prostitution, the act of selling sexual favors for money, the best way to go about preventing it, or the best thing for the girls who suffer from it? 

The answer is probably not - these girls need the freedom to go to the police and report abuse without fear of being arrested for being prostitutes. They need healthcare, safety, and *options* - the prohibition actually takes all that away.

Legalization won't end it - market economics dictate that the relatively small supply of girls willing to become prostitutes can't meet the demand, and consequently the starting price is almost $200/hr. There will always be a vast market of guys who can't afford that and are looking for cheap blow jobs which pimps will try to fill. It's the pimping that needs to be cracked down upon.

&gt; Should you have the right to sell your kidney?

This is difficult, but I'll take a stab at it.

Should I, someone of sound mind and body, conscious of all the possible risks and ramifications of such a decision, be able to sell my kidney? Yes.

Organ sales are kind of comparable actually; the thing to worry about isn't so much the people like me who might want to do it for whatever reason - it's the predators who are pushing it on desperate and poor people who are in the wrong. I'd suggest that the problem isn't so much kidney sales themselves (let's face it; they have value and an open market for them could save lives), but the equivalent of ""pimps"" who might push a poor person into it through manipulation or force.

It's kind of like saying that because some people take out sub-prime mortgages on homes they can't afford, we should implement prohibition on mortgage lending.

Pardon the wall of text, but I'm tryin' to make a point, here:

 *There was the **Panic of 1797**, primarily caused by the deflating Bank of England. The Bank of England was tied into America enough that when it did deflate, it caused a huge disruption in the commercial and real estate markets in the U.S. 

 *The **Depression of 1807-'14**, caused by the Embargo Act which,upon passing through congress, absolutely devastated the shipping industry of the U.S. 

 *The **Panic of 1819-'24**: The problems brought on by the panic were widespread and destructive. As some examples, foreclosures skyrocketed, many banks failed, unemployment reached new highs, and a huge slump in agriculture made the effects of the panic close to home for many Americans.

 *The **Panic of 1837-'43** fueled by the down-trodden confidence that the American people had at the time for paper currency, which was just becoming prevalent around this time in the U.S. This caused a huge downturn in the American economy as banks failed and confidence plummeted.

 *The **Panic of 1857-'58** (18 months) wherein the failure of a huge life insurance and trust company, which was called the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company, spurred a huge drop in European speculation for the U.S. railroads. 

 *The **Civil War 1862-'65**... Need I explain?

 *The **recession of 1873-'79**, caused primarily by economic problems in Europe. This ignited problems in the U.S., and brought about the failure of the Jay Cooke &amp; Company, which at that time was the largest bank in the United States of America.
This helped to depress a post Civil War speculative bubble which had been helping the U.S. recuperate from the devastating civil war which raged only a few years before.

 *The **1890's recession**, brought on by the failure of the United States Reading Railroad. The failure prompted European investors to then withdraw their investments, and left the U.S. financial system in a shattered mess.

 *The **Panic of 1907-08**, was actually a severe monetary contraction that manifested itself as a recession. Many people lost jobs, many businesses went out of business, and many financial institutions were challenged by the panic.

 * **Recession of 1918-'21**, characterized by severe hyperinflation in Europe, which spread to North America. A lot of it had to do with the lost production that was halted at the end of WWI. This, coupled with the influx of labor that was caused by returning troops who needed jobs, drove unemployment through the roof.

 * **Recession of 1926**, often overshadowed and forgotten because of the

 * **Great Depression of 1929-'38**

 *There were two recessions in the **late 1940's**

 *Recessions of the **early and the late 1950's**

 *Recessions in the **early and the late 1960's**

 *Oil Crisis, recession of the **mid-1970's**

t5_2qh1i,,1425934004,"Sure. :-)

Let's start with the first statement. Technically, your ISP probably offers Usenet access so, theoretically, you could get it for free. However, the speed will be lackluster. If you want to max your connection speed (and you WILL, for EVERY download... unlike Bittorrent) you need to pay for access to a fast server. A lot of people use [Giganews](http://www.giganews.com), but I use [Astraweb](http://www.news.astraweb.com/). You also should pay for a good indexing server to make the download simple and easy. I use [NewzBin](http://www.newzbin.com). If you are serious about getting set up, shoot me a PM on here and I can send you an invite code (only if you are serious though because I only get 5 invites which, you don't get back until the person you invited signs up). I'll let ya know what software you need and everything.

There is 0% chance of getting caught for a few reasons. For one, you aren't sharing anything. With bittorrent, the copyright owner just has to download the torrent, and they instantly get the IPs of everyone who is seeding the file. With Usenet, everything is downloaded from a server. 

Also, the servers work similar to DNS servers in the sense that they all mirror each other. If someone adds a file to one Usenet server, they get propagated to all of the other ones around the world. That makes getting rid of stuff on there impossible. 

That brings us to the files themselves... Everything on the server is stored as text files typically broken into 15 or 50 meg segments. You download ALL of the files for the article (which newzbin makes easy for you... it's just one click to import them all into your download program) and then you convert/decode them on your PC. The files are typically decoded back to a rar files which can then be extracted by opening any of the segments and extracting like normal. So technically, you aren't downloading rar files, but files that have been encoded into text files (that were originally rars). That means anyone watching your traffic can't really prove you have done anything illegal. In fact, you aren't physically breaking the law until you decode them and extract. Your intent is still there but that's hard to prove.

Lastly, Astraweb and Giganews both take the privacy of their customers very seriously. They don't keep any logs what you downloaded or anything like that. They just keep overall stats like the amount you have downloaded and stuff like that. You can even choose a server that isn't in your country if you wish (I use the European server). For me, it's just as fast.

I hope this helps. If you have any other questions, I'll try to answer. :-)",,t1_c083nd6,False,,t1_c0837ny,0,3,c083nd6,AskReddit,0,True,3,0,t3_82snc,flyryan,1236497904,True

WELT ONLINE: Why did Goldman Sachs come through the crisis in a better position than all of the other major western banks? Was it luck or skill?

Blankfein: We've been lucky for the last 140 years!  


Very funny man. I suppose it's easy to be a funny guy when you're so well connected to such a happy-go-lucky group of pals. Interesting coincidence how luck manages to strike the TARP mastermind Henry Paulson's good buddies at Goldman.

Subprime Europe

By LIAQUAT AHAMED
Published: March 7, 2009 

THE 1931 collapse of the Austrian bank Creditanstalt provoked financial panic across Europe and almost single-handedly turned a bad downturn into the Great Depression. Last week, when I read about the brewing European banking crisis, I suddenly began to dread that history might be repeating itself.

You might think that my worries are a bit late. After all, losses on subprime mortgages in the United States have already caused a Depression-like banking collapse. Well, believe it or not, Europe’s current crisis is scarier. For while losses on Eastern European debts may be only a small fraction of those on subprime mortgages, the continent’s problems are politically harder to solve, and their consequences may prove to be much worse.

Much as in our subprime mess, Eastern Europe’s problems began with easy credit. From 2004 to 2008 Eastern Europe had its own bubble, fueled by the ready availability of international credit. In recent years countries like Bulgaria and Latvia borrowed annually the equivalent of more than 20 percent of their gross domestic product from abroad. By 2008, 13 countries that were once part of the Soviet empire had accumulated a collective debt to foreign banks or in foreign currencies of more than $1 trillion. Some of the money went into investment, much of it into consumption or real estate.

When the music stopped last year and banks retrenched, the flow of new capital to Eastern Europe came to an abrupt halt, and then reversed direction. This credit crunch hit the region just as its main export markets in Western Europe were going into free fall. Moreover, with so much of the debt denominated in foreign currencies, everyone in Eastern Europe has been scrambling to get their hands on foreign exchange and local currencies have collapsed.

Most of the Eastern European debt is held by Western European banks. It also turned out that some of the biggest lenders to Eastern Europe were Austrian and Italian banks — for example, loans by Austrian banks to Eastern European countries are almost equivalent to 70 percent of Austria’s G.D.P. Now, Italy and Austria can’t afford to bail out even their own banks.

The debt crisis in Eastern Europe is much more than an economic problem. The wrenching decline in the standard of living caused by this crisis is provoking social unrest. American subprime borrowers who have had their houses foreclosed on are not — at least not yet — rioting in the streets. Workers in Eastern Europe are. The roots of democracy in the region are not deep and the specter of right-wing nationalism remains a threat.

So what is to be done? The potential approaches essentially mirror those that have been attempted in response to America’s subprime problem.

The first approach is to deal with the short-run liquidity problem. In the same way that the Federal Reserve expanded its own lending last year to compensate for the collapse in private lending, the International Monetary Fund is providing funds to Eastern Europe, and Hungary has proposed that the European Central Bank lend to borrowers who use non-euro assets as collateral. But given the state of the rest of the world, Eastern Europe will not be able to export its way out of its troubles in the immediate future.

The debts of many Eastern European countries and some banks will have to be written off. Ultimately, as in the case of the American subprime debts, taxpayers will have to foot the bill. But which taxpayers? The taxpayers of Austria and Italy certainly can’t. So the burden will have to fall on the rich countries of Europe, especially Germany and France.

There are two approaches to taxpayer-financed bailouts. The first is to go case by case. This is being proposed by the Germans. The problem here, as we discovered after the Bear Stearns rescue last March, is that the case-by-case approach does nothing to establish confidence in the system and prevent contagion.

The best choice would be a fund that provides bailout money and a protective umbrella to banks and countries, even those that don’t seem to need it now. Hungary has proposed the creation of such a fund with roughly $240 billion at its disposal. Though the proposal has already been rejected by stronger European economies, the American experience of last year in which the Treasury finally had to ask Congress for $700 billion for a similar fund suggests that this is where Europe will end up.

The response of the American government to the financial crisis has been criticized for being too slow and inadequate. But at least we have a federal budget, the national cohesion and the political machinery to get New Yorkers and Midwesterners to pay for the mistakes of homeowners in California and Florida, or to bail out a bank based in North Carolina. There is no such mechanism in Europe. It is going to require leadership of the highest order from officials in Germany and France to persuade their thrifty and prudent taxpayers to bail out foolhardy Austrian banks or Hungarian homeowners.

The Great Depression was largely caused by a failure of intellectual will. In other words, the men in charge simply did not understand how the economy worked. Now, it is the failure of political will that could lead to economic cataclysm. Nowhere is this danger more real than in Europe.

t5_2cneq,,1425934261,"You could argue that the interstate highway system is a white elephant for maintenance, very carbon unfriendly, inefficient for moving large numbers of people from one place to another, and downright dangerous.

The maintenance on the highways is very expensive, and we are probably hundreds of billions of dollars behind in mantaining them, particularly the bridges.  

It would be much more efficient to have people, cars, and freight moved on rail lines.  The cost of installation is much less, trains are much more fuel efficient, and you could have rail lines instead where you could just put your cars on a rail car if you wanted to to Florida on vacation.  Your car would go from getting 20 mpg to 200 mpg, and you wouldn't have to actually drive it.

Plus, how many serious accidents and deaths are caused by having the interstate highway system?  One inattentive driver can cause massive backups for hours or even potentially days if they take out a bridge.  Trains are run by professional drivers and are computer controlled to all but prevent accidents.  Plus their speeds are electronically controlled so there is no possibility of exceeding the speed limit.  

Obviously, I'm playing Devil's Advocate.  

I'm pretty conservative, but no, 'all government spending' is not bad.  Some of it is actually good.  My beef is when it is wasteful or inefficent.  

For instance, in many cities they spend $10,000/student for education.  If you have 25 students in the classroom, you can take $50,000 to pay for the teacher, and $50,000 to pay for the classroom and fractional use of the playgrounds.  Heck, figure $50,000 to bus the kids to and from school, and $25,000 for 'administration'

That still leaves $75,000 per classroom for supplies, books, computers, and whatever else they need.   That's $3,000/student.  If you bought each of them a $500 computer (every year), and $500 in books (more than I spent in college, and you can use elementary schoolbooks for years.  Addition and Fractions haven't changed in at least 500 years), you still have $2000 left per student, or $50,000 after the expenses are paid.  Where is the rest of the money going?

We need to do 0 based budgeting for government.  In other words, if you spend less than you are budgeted for (oh the horror), it shouldn't affect next years budget in a negative way.  Currently, if you have a budget for $10 million dollars, and only spend $9 million, then next year's budget is cut 10%, even though you might actually need more money the next year.  To prevent that from happening, departments then waste the extra $1 million to keep their budgets up.  Under 0 based, it looks at each year independently.  

My main beef with taxes is that I think everybody should pay something in.  That way you become concerned with how it is spent.  If you make $20,000/year, and get a $1300 EIC (or whatever it is, doesn't particularly matter), you don't care how tax money is spent, because you haven't paid in.  If you make $20,000/year, and you pay IN $200, then you suddenly care if Robert Byrd wants a gold plated bird cage in Charston, because that could be your $200 paying for it.  

And we certainly shouldn't be paying for Citibank's or BoA's screw ups.  

As far as high speed trains go, if they go somewhere where people/freight will go, then great.  But don't make them like the MARTA system in Atlanta where they don't go to the baseball stadium because the city owned the parking lots.  If they follow corridors that people will use, great, let's build them.  If they are going to be built from Alliance, Nebraska to Aberdeen, South Dakota (random small town) because some congressional fishing buddies happen to live at one end and want to fish at the other end, then we shouldn't build them.

If we are going to do this, then lets do something like the BRAC committee and do it based on realistic traffic studies.  

For instance, between LA and Las Vegas, is there enough traffic to justify it at the price point, versus flying or driving?  That's what needs to be answered.

""Some argue that although race is a valid taxonomic concept in other species, it cannot be applied to humans. Many scientists have argued that race definitions are imprecise, arbitrary, derived from custom, have many exceptions, have many gradations, and that the numbers of races delineated vary according to the culture making the racial distinctions; thus they reject the notion that any definition of race pertaining to humans can have taxonomic rigour and validity. Today many scientists study human genotypic and phenotypic variation using concepts such as ""population"" and ""clinal gradation"". Many contend that while racial categorizations may be marked by phenotypic or genotypic traits, the idea of race itself, and actual divisions of persons into races or racial groups, are social constructs.""

If you have money and a good degree studies in the US are accessible, otherwise things get a little tricky. I got lucky and was able to join a scholarship program, but that has some setbacks (more later).

Your visa is step 571 in a 3451-step process :) First you need to take the SAT/GRE and language tests and whatnot. Then you need to apply to the universities. Then you need to be admitted to a US university that will act as a sponsoring school.

Just a couple of things from my experience:

- US undergraduate studies are not necessarily on par with comparable programs in other countries. US graduate schools on the other hand are great. If you have a degree go straight to grad school in the US. It might be worth an extra year to complete your degree in your home country. Don't waste your time and money on undergrad studies in the US.

- the visa application process is a bitch. You need tons of papers and you have to submit them in the right order.

- Money is a major issue. Unless you are lucky enough to be accepted for a Ph.D. position, be prepared to spend a lot of money on your studies.

- If your home country pays for your studies the ""2 year rule"" prevents you from working in the US during two years.

- US citizenship is still many many years away.

- Exchange programs are the easiest way in. Go for a degree in your home country and study in the US. You won't get a US degree, however, if you are bright, work hard and get to know the professors, you will be asked to consider a Ph.D. A master's degree is not a straight ticket to the US; you still have to work hard to get a H-1B visa, but a Ph.D. opens many doors.

t5_2qh11,,1425934471,"I have worked in the US food service industry for more than 10 years either full time while in college and part time since graduating. I have worked (Bartender, Server, Assistant Manager, and Controller) in high end restaurants in NYC and Philadelphia. 

I wish to address your questions. 

&gt;I shouldn't be directly in charge of the waiter's wage. If I wanted to do that I'd just establish or buy a restaurant of my own. As a paying customer I would expect the restaurant owner to take care of his employees as well as the preparation of my food. Luckily I can vote with my wallet.

Then don't eat at restaurants in the US. From my experience as a controller I can ensure you that profits are tight even in the best of times. Food costs are hard to meet even in the best of times. Given the economic climate now they are even more difficult. If prices were raised to account for the increase in salaries of the staff the price of a meal would jump considerably. Servers make on average $2.13 an hour in the US and that goes towards taxes automatically. Bartenders get more ranging from $7 to $10 an hour depending on experience and skill. So the bulk of a severing staff's pay comes from tips which are taxed. Servers are legally obligated to claim 100% of the tips that they make which is taxed. 

&gt;I shouldn't have to give a judgment of the waiter's performance directly in terms of money based on one show and a number of factors out of his control. If I have a bad day, or the food is bad, or I have to wait just because the owner has staffed too sparingly for the evening will probably ruin the evening for me but I can't really tell how much more the waiter could have done. Having to keep measuring the waiter's performance is pretty hard but OTOH picking up exceptionally good performance is rather easy as it will stand out by definition.

Those are factors which a good server will smooth over. I have turned people from being miserable and having a bad day into happy people, it’s rather easy. I have also been in situations where we were grossly understaffed and I have paid attention to detail and ensured that my guests did not want for anything. It’s all about the quality of the staff. To address the fact that a server is not in control of the food is wrong. A good server will refuse to bring sub par product to a table. I have refused food that was not up to standards, mind you I have never worked at a TGI Friday's or some lower to mid-range places that may not allow for the discretion of the server. Moreover, if you feel that you should not be the judge of someone’s performance then do not eat at restaurants in the US because that is how business is conducted. 

&gt;Tipping effectively avoids paying wages without them being subjected to income tax and thus adds to the government's pressure to raise more taxes on things that actually can be taxed.

No that is wrong, as previously mentioned servers are legally obligated to claim 100% of their tips. 

&gt;Customary tipping is based on the total bill; why not just add the same dang amount to the bill itself and pay the waiter the proper salary in the first place! Then again, optionally tipping for exceptionally good service is more of a subjective issue and I can just follow my heart on how much extra I want to give to my waiter. This gets rid of the insanity of tipping him differently for pouring a bottle of x dollar wine versus 10x dollar wine.

Every computer system I have used has allowed for whatever percentage you want allocated as a tip to be added to bills. You can ask for this to be done. In my experience some people tip on wine some don't. That again would be at the guest’s discretion.

&gt;While tipping should supposedly keep the waiters more focused on serving you well, it also keeps the customers on their toes. You can react in only two ways to being expected to pay tip for mediocre or bad service: suppress your frustration or be forced to confront the issue. The latter probably spoils the fun for the evening. I can still have fun despite of bad service but I don't want to explicitly reward it.

Sup par service would result in a sub par tip. If you have a bad experience then leave a bad tip, no need for a confrontation.

&gt;Tipping blurs the total price of the food and service. It's hard to compare the price and quality of one restaurant to the restaurant next door if there are such variables in the total cost. This is of course less of a problem if eating out in your city or country is inexpensive anyway.

No it doesn't, you are totally wrong. I can see that being the case if you compare the US to the EU but not within the US. 

&gt;Well-tipping people are probably fought over by waiters upon arrival. Their income shouldn't depend on which of them fights to get the known good customers.

Again no, good customers request certain servers, no fight; servers establish and maintain relationships with good guests.

I hope this address you questions. In short if you do not like how restaurant conduct themselves in the US please don't go to them. We don't want people in them that don't know how to tip. *Or those that feel morally obligated not to tip*

Ok here goes!

1. I don't believe in 100% equality between the sexes. Partly because I am constantly reading how men who beat women are scum. Violence is violence, it shouldn't matter if you beat up a woman, gay man, black man or whatever. 

As a young, white, straight, man I find it incredibly frustrating that I got beaten up a few years back and the police dropped the case almost instantly even when I pointed out the group they belonged to (they had hung around to gloat while the 2 guys had scarpered).

I also find feminism to be flawed, men and women compete seperately in the olympics because if they were to compete together, the majority of the sports would be dominated by men. Before I am labeled a dick, I feel that we should encourage our differences, we aren't the same and I like that. I do agree that if men and women do 100% identical jobs then they should get paid the same but is it ever that black and white? Ok so in Scotland the gap is something ridiculous like 20% but it's not just about how you do your job but what you bring to the workplace as well. In a retail job I was constantly picked out to do the shit jobs like litterpick, collect the discarded carts from the car pack, no matter the weather it was always a guy chosen. I found that to be sexist, how can they preach about equality?

-2. I don't think we should donate any money to 3rd world countries, not until we live in a Utopia with excess everything. We have poor people here and crime and shortages of jobs, why should we throw money to them? 

We all started at the same point, if anything the African nations had a headstart since we first evolved from there. 

If they chose to run around in tribes and fight each other then that's their choices, Europeans became civilised and built up their nations.

* fun to pilot, especially downhill.

We enjoyed those benefits indeed, but also less expected ones:

* You can't imagine how much time you spend looking at your front wheel instead of the landscape, on a standard bike, until you rode a recumbent. Really.

* They are _much_ more stable than a touring bike when heavily loaded.

* They're not only comfortable, they're relaxing. Being on a lounge chair rather than a saddle really has an impact on your mood, after a while!

As for riding in traffic: if I must believe bicycling.reddit, US drivers really turn into psychopaths when they see a bike, so I don't know how generalizable a European experience can be, but it's not that bad. 

Of course, a low racer such as the one in the post shouldn't even be considered street legal, but with a reasonnably high bike (Nazca Pionneer, Optima Condor...), you're at eye-level with drivers, and the weirdness factor makes you at least as visible as a normal bike.

I think this is a bad analogy. I never took out insurance to protect someone else, I took it out to protect myself. If the government voids my insurance policy, then the injured party will need to sue me in court to prove that I was at fault. If he caused the accident, then I really have nothing to worry about. 

I don't really see a problem here at all. I think you're trying to claim some moral obligation on my part, that I'm someone responsible for his life, but I'm not. He is responsible for his life and I'm for mine. If he drove 100mph and caused an accident, then I shouldn't have to pay a dime to him. If I drove 100mph and hurt him, then I deserve to have the pants sued off of me and lose everything.

Insurance was merely a way to protect me and hedge my bet. I benefited from insurance, since  I could now drive 100mph if I liked and not worry about consequences. I paid a premium for this, so I had a downside and an upside. It was a hedge. When I lost the insurance, I lost both the upside and the downside.

&gt; Look at the world picture. Say banks in Europe, Russia, China, Japan take on debt obligations of American banks, and just in case, they also take out credit default insurance.

This isn't a completed thought. So what if they take out insurance on their investments, what do I care? Am I supposed to care that they do or they do not have homeowners insurance as well in Moscow? Insurance is about protecting me, not anyone else.

It wasn't until the abandonment of classical economics in the late 19th century (because of the appearance that classical economics paved the way to Marxism) that knowledge of sound economics was quietly lost.  

It was in this intellectual vacuum that business cartelization occurred in the early 20th century, and after about 30 years of mainstream economists having largely out of context, memorized conclusions of the classical economists' free market conclusions, that is when Keynes appeared on the scene.  He produced a doctrine that was able to demolish these out of context conclusions (even though they were legitimate).  Since then, the US has been slowly moving towards Hobbes' vision.

Did not find any, apart from vague references to bureacracy.

One of the links you provided is not working. The other does not make much sense (sorry, humans are not computers and use decimal rather than binary fractions, besides NOTHING in metric system makes it unfriendly towards binary fractions).

&gt; And these Europeans, do they prefer the Metric System because they grew up with it

The point is, that advantages of imperial units are quite unclear to those numerous europeans (me included) even when forced (by the environment) to use the imperial system for many years.

&gt; that evolution often produces ""optimal"" [i.e., relatively, circumstantial favorable traits).

Favorable? Yes. Sufficient for survival? Sure. Optimal? No way.

And this might be the crux of the matter. There is no question that imperial system *IS* useable. Similarly, there is no question, that both systems rely on somewhat arbitrary base units (meter vs inch). And it goes without saying that there always will be niche units (used in a particular domain but not others)

But metric system has two distinct advantages: it's very scaleable (can easily express any measurement result) and this scalability is universal (done the same way with all units) and it's very friendly towards decimal fractions.

(Do note that both of these considerations did not exist when imperial units first arose).

&gt; One, arrogance. Something like, ""Scientists are smarter and prefer the Metric System. Therefore, the Metric System is superior.

How dare they to think that they are smarter?? Arrogant bastards! Think of it! These are the same liberal scientists which corrupt out children with evolution nonsense and earth is round garbage.

Actually, looking at the motives of the participants isn't terribly helpful in an instance like this.  Take Eichmann, for example: regarded as the architect of the Holocaust.  He was essentially in charge of the Final Solution.  Yet, he doesn't seem to have been an anti-semite.  He had an ongoing fascination with Jewish religion and studied it continually.  His interest in the subject was likely a major influence on his decision to break with Protestantism in 1937.  Ask about his involvement in the Nazi party, he said that he joined not because he felt any affinity with their ideology or cause, but rather because he wished to build a career.

The distressing fact of the matter is that a great many German Nazis participated in the Holocaust not because they had any particular feeling or opinion regarding ethnic or religious Judaism, but because the Party was the only thing going at the time, or because it stirred up nationalistic feeling, or for any number of other reasons that don't have much to do with anti-semitism.

Some obviously were anti-semites; for some, their anti-semitism was part of a grander racist chauvanism, as with Himmler.  Again, tracing the anti-semitism that did exist in that society back to Catholic teachings is easier said than done.  If you have some evidence of a direct link, that would be useful, but so far what you've given is an example from the 15th century that may or may not have had some influence.

Now bear in mind, I'm not denying that medieval Christendom had a history of anti-Jewish violence and discrimination.  All I'm challenging is the easy assumption that modern anti-semitism is a direct result of the dissemination of that tradition.

&gt; In all what you have written so far you're trying to avoid to discuss why they were in such a position to begin with.

Not at all.  Clearly the position of 18th and 19th century European Jewry is a result of their typically ambiguous, often marginalized status in the preceding centuries.  But that doesn't mean that there's a direct ideological continuity between modern anti-Semites and medieval anti-Jewish sentiment, and I find arguments to the effect that they differ in origin persuasive.

&gt; I wonder why they aren't any movements in the Church who accuse heretic sects of this today but there are still some who do the same for Jews? Of course you could hold the cynical view that there just aren't any Waldenses, Cathari or Knight Templars left to kill, but there still are some Jews to go. What do you think?

I think you've got some whacked out friends if you know people who are still accusing Jews of eating children.

&gt;So you rely on religious motivations? You think a creator designed us each for a specific purpose?

Well, in the case of domesticated animals, yes, obviously, a creator designed them each for a special purpose:  Humans!  Domesticated animals and plants are designed from natural seed-stock for human use.  In the case of wild animals are designed (better word would have been ""evolved"" maybe?) for greater fitness.  

&gt;That's actually false, but in this case a moot point because this species of bird was going to die out anyway.

I'd love to see rationale for the suggestion that higher level biological systems (ecosystems) can exist without their constituent components (individual species).  

I assume what you mean is that many individual species can be lost without affecting the quality of an ecosystem's service.  To which, I would reply, the problem is figuring out which species can be lost without affecting the ecosystem services we desire.  Perhaps this bird is a bad example (I'm honestly mostly ignorant of European fauna), but there are certainly examples out there of species being lost that caused changes in our ability to use or profit from ecosystems (just look at fisheries as an example).  

However, my original point was to explain to you why some people value cattle differently than rare birds or other wild animals.  I'm not asking you to share that opinion.

As a side note for this example, my understanding is that the bird is making a comeback.  Many north American birds of prey have made dramatic comebacks as well, largely due to changes we made in our use of pesticides.

Breastfeeding and Adoption
Question

I have a patient who is going to adopt a newborn in early October. She would like to breastfeed the baby. Are there any reliable medications to induce lactation, or should she simply begin trying to pump in the near future?

Response from  Dena Goffman, MD, and Peter S. Bernstein, MD, MPH 
Dena Goffman, MD, fellow in Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York                                                                                                                                                                                                         Peter S. Bernstein, MD, MPH, FACOG, Associate Professor of Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology and Women's Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York; Medical Director of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Comprehensive Family Care Center, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York

Human milk is recognized as the optimal feeding for all infants, although preterm infants often require nutritional supplementation. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life and partial breastfeeding (breastmilk plus complementary foods) for at least 12 months and as long as mutually desired thereafter.[1] Well-recognized short-term benefits to the infant include improved nutrition, gastrointestinal function, host defense, and psychological well-being. Breastfeeding is also associated with long-term benefits to the infant, both short and long-term benefits to the mother, and economic benefits for the family and society.[2]

Given that it is well recognized that breastfeeding provides ideal nutrition and has many additional benefits, the question about breastfeeding in the setting of adoption is an important one. Adopted infants in developing countries are usually breastfed, and successful lactation without the need for supplementation is crucial for the survival of adopted infants.[3] Fortunately, success has been documented.[3-5] In industrialized countries, where supplemental feeds are readily available and are of good nutritional quality, lactation may not be required for survival but may provide substantial benefit to the mother and infant.

It is possible for women who have never been pregnant or have never lactated to successfully breastfeed. With the use of preparation, medications, artificial aids, tried techniques, and significant support, induced lactation can be achieved. Preparing the breast can entail both administering medications and performing techniques. In women who are nulliparous or have never lactated, priming the breast with ethinyl estradiol 50 micrograms 3 times daily, or with 1-time administration of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate 100 mg intramuscularly, is recommended. Preparation of the breast should also be started in advance by using a breast pump for regular stimulation of the nipples.[3]

Galactagogues are medications that can induce or enhance breast milk production and have been used for inadequate milk supply, induced lactation and relactation. The most extensively studied galactagogue, documented to be safe and effective, is metoclopramide (Reglan). Metoclopramide is a central dopamine antagonist that acts to stimulate prolactin release. Recommended dosage options include 10 mg 2 to 4 times daily, followed by a taper rather than abrupt cessation. Potential side effects include fatigue, anxiety, dizziness, diarrhea, and gastric cramping; more rarely, extrapyramidal symptoms or depression may develop. There have been no documented reactions in infants exposed to metoclopramide in breast milk.[6] Chlorpromazine 25 mg 4 times daily can be used as an alternative to or in conjunction with metoclopramide. On rare occasions, when unsuccessful, methyldopa 125 mg 4 times daily may be added.[3]

Domperidone (Motilium) acts as a peripheral dopamine antagonist and also increases serum prolactin and milk yield. This is the only galactagogue proven effective through a small double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. It has fewer maternal side effects, and no side effects have been reported in infants exposed via breast milk. However, in the United States, domperidone can only be dispensed by a compounding pharmacy, and cost varies.[6]

Fenugreek, a European herb from the pea family, has anecdotally been reported to increase milk production, although data are lacking. It is theorized to stimulate sweat production, which may enhance milk secretion since the breast is a modified sweat gland. The usual dose is 2 to 3 capsules 3 times a day until adequate milk production is attained.[6]

Oxytocin, either oral or nasal spray, has been used in women with inadequate milk supply and is reported to cause a milk ""letdown"" effect. The medication causes contraction of the cells surrounding the alveoli and thus stimulates milk ejection, which may improve production by decreasing stasis.[6] Given the mechanism of action, it seems that the use of oxytocin alone would be less useful in attempts to induce lactation.

To optimize breastfeeding potential, infants should be put to the breast as soon as possible after birth and frequently thereafter, about every 2 hours. Artificial nipples should be avoided as babies learn different suckling techniques. To promote suckling when there is a lack of breast milk, formula can be poured over the areola from a cup or dropper to promote suckling. When supplementation of breast milk is necessary initially, other options include formula feeds given immediately after suckling with a cup and spoon or the use of Lact-aid. Lact-aid is a line attached to a pack which supplies formula through a feeding tube placed beside the maternal nipple. The infant learns to suckle at the breast while obtaining nutrition and does not become accustomed to a bottle. Supplementation is gradually reduced as maternal milk supply increases.[4]

Successful induction of lactation has been reported in adoptive mother-baby pairs. A group of 240 adopted infants is described in which 80% were previously bottle-fed, 35% of the mothers were nulliparous and 23% had never previously breastfed. Of these infants, 75% were willing to nurse by the end of the first week of trying, and more than 75% of mothers felt positive about their lactation experience; 54% required supplementation for the duration of nursing, but 25% of women who had never been pregnant before were able to eliminate supplements completely before weaning off the breast. The benefit of bonding was generally felt to be more important than milk production.[5]

With appropriate medical treatment, use of techniques, motivation, perseverance, and support, breastfeeding is a realistic option, with significant benefits to both mother and infant, in the setting of adoption.

t5_2qh13,,1425936333,"In the interest of honesty : the ones wanting to introduce gun control should acknowledge that they advocate for a less-free society. And the ones arguing for no gun control should acknowledge that they are advocating a more violent society…

Saying that a ban on guns does not take any meaningful freedom away is nonsense : it clearly does. Just as well is it nonsense to say that owning a gun will make you safer. It only makes it more likely that you end up in a gun-related accident (through your own stupidity or someone else’s criminality is irrelevant)

In my opinion the differences between the European and American mindset are largely explained due to the environment. America has more, large rural areas where the freedom to own a gun is a real asset. Europe has more large heavily populated city centers where gun-related accidents are more likely to kill innocent bystanders. It is no coincidence that countries with more tolerant gun laws in Europe are rural while the cities/districts in America that have gun control law overruled due to being unconstitutional tend to be heavily populated cities.

I live in Europe in a big city. The strict gun control laws here make a real difference on the street, make me safer and don’t take a freedom away that I can actually take advantage of. So I support them. On the other hand in a rural area I would not support those same laws for exactly the same reasons : they wouldn’t make an actual difference in safety while preventing some real benefits of owning a gun that I could take actually advantage of.

Therefore I would not support a constitutional right/ban on guns for a country the size and diversity of the USA. I think if guns were banned in Washington DC but allowed everywhere else, the net effect on America would be positive. On the other hand, the constitution of the USA is such a powerful and positive document, that undermining it by hollowing out certain parts even if they do not make sense in today’s realty would risk to destroy so much of the value of the other clauses that this is just the price to pay.

    * (c) in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or insurrection.""


Seems like people really thinks that this will mean that the hangings will start shortly:

""It is obvious that this hidden footnote is intended to destroy any future chance for people to stand up against abuse maltreatment or exploitation by government and those in authority.

I dont know where you get your impression that I want you to lie to me or suck up to me, or that I hate facts and truth, you are treating me like some kind of lowlife-ideologist just because I am having a debate. Please note that this was your first post in which you actually engaged in some statements that explained your opinions, something I have been trying to get out of you for a while.

I read your other posts on the board and gather that this is simply your style, but being ""angry"" would with most people not really work in your favor. Luckily I am a patient guy and refrain from getting too personal -

The facts on Switzerland do indeed not convince me, no, however they do portray a side to the topic which I find interesting. Considering the fact - if you believe wikipedia - that I posted up there you would still have to argue that they half half the guns so your first argument comparing the US to Switzerland stands unconfirmed. I dont have done particular research into this, but the first info I found on it sais the opposite of what you say, so that in itself is interesting considering how very loud you are about this.

Also, I always refrained from saying guns are the only factor in violent crime, obviously a city like London or Manchaster have a higher crime rate as i.e. idylic Geneva or a Mountain-Village in the Alps, it might be possible that Luxemburg has the highest murder rate in Europe per capita, who knows!

You still have not explained why the US has 12000 deaths a year and Europe doesnt. 

And no, I dont have to study Iraq or Tahiti to make a study about Gun Control in Germany, or any study for that matter. That is a claim I find ludicrious as to be coherently supportive of it you would hae to isolate any topic in all nations in all cases to gain any sensible results on anything. clearly this is nonsense as certain factors are trivial and play no role and others do - guns availability being certainly more of a factor in gun crime than the cost of red meat or the speed limit.

Telling anyone what they *must* believe is going to rub some people wrong, particularly if you insist they must believe it because you've mistaken a caricature of their beliefs as their actual beliefs.  As I've pointed out elsewhere in this thread, literal interpretation of the Bible as the inerrant word of God is the larger part of what makes a Christian fundamentalist.  Behaving as though moderates should have to conform to the logical conclusions necessitated by a fundamentalist belief is as fallacious as it would be for a Christian apologist to argue that all atheists should have to accept the conclusions of the most extreme atheist position.  If you don't share that position, why should you have to buy into its logical end?

&gt; Where are these Christians? Europe? New Hampshire?

Granted they're not especially numerous in America, but according to the Newsweek poll you quoted in another comment, around 36% of the U.S. population doesn't think the entire Bible should be read literally.  Given that, it's worthwhile asking what they mean, or took the pollsters to mean, by the phrase ""word of God"".  Europe having a larger Catholic population likely means they're even less inclined towards Biblical literalism, since literalism is primarily an innovation of Protestantism and the Church has always relied on councils and proclamation to mediate Biblical interpretation.  It was the Catholic Church, after all, that provided for the academic studies that resulted in source criticism.

&gt;""The idea that life on Earth has evolved was widely discussed in Europe in the late 1700's and the early part of the last century. In 1859 Charles Darwin supplied a mechanism, namely natural selection, that could explain how evolution occurs. "" 

From the other article you linked in a parent post:
&gt;Darwin continually emphasized the difference between his two great and separate accomplishments: establishing the fact of evolution, and proposing a theory--natural selection--to explain the mechanism of evolution.

Like I said: Evolution was an observation, natural selection was an explaination for it.

Again from the article:
&gt;more recently the classic Neo-Darwinian view has been replaced by a new concept which includes several other mechanisms in addition to natural selection. Current ideas on evolution are usually referred to as the Modern Synthesis

Like I said, Evolutionary theory is no longer just natural selection. But several other mechanisms as well. Its not called the theory of evolution, nor was it ever. That is all.

Our morals are learned, by one mechanism or another, and are ""luxuries"" of our ability to make choices about how we want to survive. Reduce those choices and the very selfless among us might die to keep their morals intact - but most would kill to keep their lives. As a child, I stole what I wanted, thought nothing of how others around me felt. When I saw someone else hurt, I didn't emphasize. Rather, I was simply glad it wasn't me. I quickly learned right from wrong, however. But I often wonder, would I still be as principled if my life was at stake?

Most Israelis not in possession of these documents will receive ‘expedited waivers.’ The Report claims that, “Alongside a decline in Jewish births and a rise in Palestinian fertility, approximately 1.6 million Israelis are likely to return to their forefather’s lands in Russia and Eastern and Western Europe with scores of thousands electing to stay, depending on the nature of the transition.”

**""Clean coal"" is a myth, but clean nuclear isn't.** Why are people scared of nuclear power? Three reasons: nuclear weapons proliferation, nuclear waste, and the threat of radiation.

But nuclear weapons proliferation isn't a threat in the United States, since we already *have* nuclear weapons. Modern nuclear reactor designs (like pebble-bed and CANDU reactors) produce waste in well-contained packages, and support reprocessing of waste into fuel. And a coal-fired power plant produces more radioactive contamination than a nuke plant, because coal contains traces of uranium, which end up in the atmosphere.

Want to reduce air pollution? Support nuclear power. As a knock-on effect, making electricity cheaper would improve the value proposition for electric and plug-in hybrid cars. Nuclear power is one of those places where we can have an ecological win whilst creating abundance -- a kick in the pants to those who believe that eco-friendly means artificial scarcity.

**Impoverished nations don't make much pollution, but unfree developed nations make much more pollution than free ones.** China is the #1 polluter by a long shot -- and an unfree political system deprives the grassroots of the ability to start an ecological movement as happened in the United States and Europe. In the free world, activists can demand change; in China, activists can get shot.

It would help people who are ignorant (such as yourself) figure out he's full of shit.

&gt; As far as the actually point at hand. I think the major difference is that the Africans and Jews did not have a choice. Rather, they were forced into making the choice. 

See, ignorant. Slavery has been common in the lands around the Sahara for centuries before the Atlantic triangle trade. Whites themselves would be captured and sold as slaves (including even Michiel de Ruyter), which isn't as odd as it seems if you know the word 'slave' comes from Slav (the Eastern European population group that includes Russians and Poles).

When Portuguese, Netherlandic and other Western European ships arrived on the north west coast of Africa, they could at most make a dent in the existing kingdoms... a very tiny dent. Aside from being overwhelmingly outnumbered, not knowing the terrain and having their weapons and tactics adopted, malaria and other diseases ensured the WE's would have to wait until the arrival of machine guns and better medicine before they could start their Scramble for Africa.

In other words, Africans weren't forced to sell their enemies -other Africans- into slavery. They just did it to get rid of them and get weapons and valuables in return. Taking prisoners of war =/= snitching.

t5_2qh13,,1425937592,"Well first of I just want to say how delighted I am to have received an intelligent response, but just as in every discussion I shall give you my response, which will be antagonistic to yours, and then await your reply.

You mentioned the UN partition plan of 1947. Now I want to ask you to look at the British Mandate of 1920-1948, and before that Ottoman territorial holdings. If you wish you can delve even further into history and see that there has never been an Israeli state in the region until 1948.
Of course Palestine rejected the 1947 UN Partition for a few good reasons reasons. 1. It was administered and decided upon by a group of Europeans who felt guilty for the hardships experienced by Jews during the Holocaust. Palestinians were not in the UN, they had no say about what was going on with their homeland. 2. It had been their home for centuries, and suddenly some foreigners come in and take it away and give it to your spiritual enemy. Its asinine to assume Palestine would be content giving up their nation without being included in the decision process. 
For example, imagine your family owns a house, its been in the family for generations. Suddenly a couple of guys from across town tell you that you now must share your home with the people who your family has been feuding with forever. Would you say, ""oh yea, great! you guys take upstairs and we will take downstairs""? No, you would say ""get the fuck out of my house. THIS IS MY HOME!"" 
And realistically even if you did decide to say ""lets split it up"", eventually you are going to cross paths and then the home turns into the war zone, much like the Middle East has. 

The constant violence of the Middle East that it is characterized with today is a modern phenomenon. Sure there have always been bloody wars in the region, but those were more about religion, and today they are more about policy.

You say Israel is a responder nation, I agree with you on that. Unfortunately Hamas is also reactive, and not proactive. Palestein has a very sound claim for their violence, because in many ways they are simialr to the American founding fathers. America was threatened by British controls which they had no influence in deciding and thus they resorted to terrorist tactics to fight the occupying British. The same is true for Palestine, they are not waging war against Israel, they are defending themselves from Israeli encroachment. 

You also mention how Jordan and Egypt were willing to settle for peace. Well this also makes perfect sense. Nasser in Egypt was completely outclassed, his troops were equipped with far inferior weaponry and he was more concerned about keeping Egypt together than fighting a war. Also, one should not forget the antagonism the British and Americans were causing in regards to Nassar trying to nationalize the Suez Canal. Jordan too was a weakened state, and could not engage in prolonged combat. But here is the kicker, Israel, a newly formed nation somehow kicked their ass completely, thanks in large part to American weapons and training. It is no coincidence that with American built fighter jets flying over Jordan while many of the king's troops lacked automatic weapons that Jordan would also be begrudgingly happy with peace. Sure Israel was also happy to stop fighting because it had made considerable territorial gains, and anything more may have invoked the ire of the world.   

But the fact remains that Israel should never have come into existence the way it did, because lets face it, it cheated another group of people out of their home. If Israel had been formed through rebellion, much like America and most of Continental Europe, then its place on the map would be far more legitimate, but because Israel came into existence because of the guilt of foreign politicians and generals, well that does not bode well for legitimacy. Palestine had their homeland removed from them and given to their sworn enemy, I think they have every right to be pissed off. That does not mean I agree with their course of action, but again Palestinian aggression is a response to Israeli presence, and now it has become that Israeli aggression is the response to Palestine's fight for sovereignty.

You're right, rooting for the underdog should not be a governing principal in who we choose to support, but you see Palestine is only the underdog because they were cheated and omitted, and I think there is something very different between supporting an underdog and and not supporting the top dog. 
This is also a reason why I don't support the massive amounts of aid Israel receives from America, because if Israel were to stand on its own, then Palestine would no longer be an underdog, but more of an equal contender. Think of it as Political Darwinism. If a nation cannot stand on its own, then it is too weak to survive. Obviously this is much more ambiguous these days with economic interdependency, but I think if Israel can hold their own without American support then they deserve to have their spot on the map, but as long as they rely on American hegemony to do their bidding, then their position on the map is legitimately dubious...unless Israel decides to become the 51st state.

t5_2qh13,,1425937633,"&gt;Now I want to ask you to look at the British Mandate of 1920-1948, and before that Ottoman territorial holdings. If you wish you can delve even further into history and see that there has never been an Israeli state in the region until 1948.

In fact, the only soverign state in the region was the Kingdom of Israel, which existed until 70AD. There never was a Palestinain state, ever. In fact, Palestinians did not define *themselves* as a nation until the end of the 19th century (you can look it up).

&gt;If Israel had been formed through rebellion, much like America and most of Continental Europe, then its place on the map would be far more legitimate, but because Israel came into existence because of the guilt of foreign politicians and generals, well that does not bode well for legitimacy.

Since the partition paln was rejected by the Arabs, Israel was born in war, and is therefor, in your own words, completely legitimate.

&gt;  America was threatened by British controls which they had no influence in deciding and thus they resorted to terrorist tactics to fight the occupying British.

Just to remind you, the *native Americans* were practically wiped out. Bith the British colonialists and the ""Founding fathers"" were occupiers.

&gt;Nasser in Egypt was completely outclassed, his troops were equipped with far inferior weaponry and he was more concerned about keeping Egypt together than fighting a war.

I think you should read up on Egyptian history. Saddat made the Peace treaty, and only after a very bloody war.

&gt;This is also a reason why I don't support the massive amounts of aid Israel receives from America, because if Israel were to stand on its own, then Palestine would no longer be an underdog, but more of an equal contender.

t5_6,,1425937649,"""...we must reduce and stop carbon emissions""

This is my whole point. We need cuts of 90%+ of todays levels to stand half a chance. This needs to happen within a few years. IT WON'T. Wishful thinking will not change that. I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news. 

The wars, drought, starvation, migration and death of which you speak will happen if we forced China or India** to make such dramatic cuts as large chunks of their populations would be thrown into unimaginable strife and poverty. Ironically, nuking ourselves back to the stone age is probably the only way such cuts could be achieved, though there are some obvious downsides to that.

Stop believing that countries like China or India are going to listen to us on this They won't. And without them, we cannot stop this. I'm not the one in denial here i'm afraid. On the contrary, i fully accept the hopelessness of our position and believe our biggest aim should be the survival of humanity. If we don't, then the mass extinction that follows will leave us and most life currently on the planet as irrelevant as the dinosaurs. In a million years, Earth will be thriving again one way or the other, it's simply a question of humanity will still be around.

Finally i did not mean to suggest that we could invent our way out of this. I actually have a much worse feeling about what is coming that you seem to. IMO, the only insignificantly tiny chance of this not ending with most humans dying is a technological breakthrough. Who could have predicted in 1939 the technology of 1945 - necessity led to all of it. Other than that, preperation is our only option to ensure that some of our species remain with at least some of the knowledge that has taken thousands of years to develop.

ps - you may notice i created this reddit account specifically to make my first point. I did it because your views are correct and noble, but misguided and i'm sorry to say, naive. It is only when there are enough intelligent people thinking in a pragmatic way about this that may allow humanity to survive. Sadly i am not the best writer in the world and it is a tough issue to concisely summarise your views on within a few paragraphs, but i promise i am not baiting you. Please just think about how cuts of this level could ever be achieved within the necessary timescale. I am sure that in time, you will reluctantly come to the same sad conclusions that i have - they can't.

As for gathering enough seed? It's not that difficult to get wheat kernels and in fact it would have been easier for ancient man to get them since we selected wheat to not fall off.

I'm an anthropologist by the way.

You don't need a grain grinder to eat grain, you need to grind it to make flour which was something many cultures did do but didn't need to do. They used a mano by the way which is the name for the pestle, the mortar could be any flat stone we call metate. The only thing I can think of off the top of my head that had to be ground was acorns so the tanins could be leeched out.

A typical neolithic diet would include a lot of wild grain, fruits, berries, nuts, veggies and maybe a small bird or two in a week. As I said, most energy was received from plants. You seem to be trying to fram my statement in another light, something pretty dishonest for you to do.

Man as the ""Great Hunter"" has been pretty thoroughly debunked except when mankind found it's way to a new continent and found wildlife that wasn't afraid of them. Which is why horses, cameloids and at least one species of bison went extinct in North America.

We have plenty of archeological evidence, especially patterns of wear on teeth, to show that early man had far more vegetarians or people who ate very little meat than we have to show that early man ate a lot of meat.

We also have a lot of evidence that pre-neolithic man didn't for the most part go out of their way to live in freezing climates though those that did live in freezing climates tended to make the agrarian transition before the neolithic.

And yes potatoes weren't available to Europeans in pre-neolithic times. Of course they weren't available to Peruvians either at the time. Neither were olives or bananas available to South Americans or North Americans. I was giving a list of food you are familiar with today and in fact foods that are available year round to many or most consumers. The food that early man was familiar with was substantially larger than you or I are familiar with today. Your argument seems to conveniently and repeatedly ignore that.

Hint, modern man deals with cold much differently than ancient man. For that matter humans who haven't lived in houses deal with cold much differently than those that have. You're making a fallacy to suggest that.

You know what else there wasn't in pre-neolithic society? Society. At least in the way you use it. You might find 25 people living together but even that would be a high number.

As for living in the winter on a vegetarian diet, you should look into hair analysis and dental analysis of Iceman. You'll find it is entirely possible and very likely that he did just that at least until a short time before he was killed. Here is a decent, well cited, and easy to read writeup on it:

Moai carving and transport were in full swing from 1400 to 1600, just 122 years before first contact with European visitors to the island. In those 122 years, Rapa Nui underwent radical change.

t5_2cneq,,1425938289,"I understand it this way:

It is deeply rooted in the American culture and mind that it is better to have no ceiling or floor than to have a floor but also a ceiling. I can recall hearing this idea in many forms, but the basic idea is this: to the extent that you have a safety net, you also have a glass ceiling. It is better to have limitless potential than safety.

Americans view Europe as a comfortable plantation in which the slaves are well cared for. However, Americans think that in Europe a person cannot exceed a certain middle-class level by their own intelligence or hard work. They think Europe has a glass ceiling. If you are born rich, you stay that way. If you are born poor or middle class, the highest you can rise is middle class.

If this were true, I'd agree and I'd bash Europe along with the American right. But it's not true. Europe has entrepreneurship, and America is far more socialistic than the American right will admit.

I think the American right is skilled at the manipulation of this sentiment. They manipulate it to hide from Americans the fact that we have developed our own caste system and our own landed nobility. Our nobility is born into wealth, given trust funds, and sent to elite ""Ivy League"" educational institutions. Their family ties and Ivy League connections constitute a noble title that entitles them to a life of greater wealth and power than the commoners.

The right used to argue that America's nobility wasn't a true nobility since they could fail. After all, in America we have a free market. Recent events have exposed that as a lie as well. If you are a member of the nobility, you get a bailout. The free market only applies to commoners.

America is seething with a quiet anger over this. I expect to see some serious realignment in the future, unless the right can channel the whole thing into vapid anti-intellectual populism. They are good at that you know... they channeled the 60s counterculture into vapid New Age fluff and they successfully defused the 90s libertarian movement by branding it as the ""militia movement"" and linking it in rhetoric with terrorism, racism, etc.

Marxism isn't the only flavour of Socialism, I openly said that earlier (""because you want socialism to be discredited ideas of Marxist communism "" - I openly said otherwise, so don't twist my words), but that doesn't mean anything can be Socialism. FFS Hitler claimed to be a Socialist (While clearly renouncing Marxism) but any sensible analysis in hindsight clearly says he isn't. It's important to see the difference between people staying true to the Socialist ideals (Which isn't just Marxists, Marxism is a methadology with a view to Socialism, there are other methadologies as I stated earlier) and Social Democrats who have taken ideas from Socialism and removed any class basis from their work and any view to destroying Capitalism, or the Class system itself, from their ideas

Look back at the early history  of the Reformist movement and you see exactly the same thing, they continued to claim to be Marxists for a long time becuase that is what drew the working class in, they were long ago shown to be otherwise (""Kautsky has turned Marx in to a common Liberal"" - Lenin), modern Social Democracy is essentially doing the same thing.",,t1_c08a9om,False,,t1_c08a9n9,0,1,c08a9om,worldnews,0,True,1,0,t3_84zcx,[deleted],1237286290,True

But that bureaucracy is subject to the daily valuations of other people, where at any time the people can stop soliciting the bureaucratic business in question.

What you want is to make bureaucracy permanent.

&gt;There is a place for a free market, which does not exist when global corporations are few in each area of the market.

What is inherently wrong with few corporations in the free market?  If they keep doing things right, then they should get big.  Firms that shouldn't get big can only get big by government protection and subsidies.

&gt;A free market only exists when there are many competing businesses, something that will never happen as long as huge corporations exist.

That is not the definition of a free market.  That is the doctrine of ""pure and perfect competition"", which was thought up by anti-capitalist economists, and, ironically, is not about competition at all but exactly zero competition.

&gt;You seem to be one of the few who think this.

Consensus does not ipso facto mean truth.

&gt;Most people, myself included, see both deregulation and the corporatization of the government as the reasons for the current economic collapse.

Why is ""most people"" the be all and end all?  Most people elected Bush twice.  Most people thought the Earth was flat.  Most people think consumption can cure too much consumption.

The idea that deregulation is the reason for the economic collapse is propounded by those who either do not understand economics, or they have a bias that they want others to believe in order to justify their bias.  The media and the government are trying very hard to spread the myth that laissez-faire capitalism is responsible for the economic collapse.

Nothing could be further from the truth.

The sole source for economic booms and busts is the Federal Reserve, whose existence is a violation of laissez-faire capitalism.  They centrally plan the economy, determining interest rates (and hence the interest rate you pay for on car and student loans), they control the money supply (and hence the purchasing power of money), they determine who gets the money first and who gets it last (and hence determines the rate of wealth transfer from the poor to the rich), they determine whether or not to make or break Presidencies.  They can make a President look great by pumping the economy full of money and causing a boom.  They can make a President look terrible by stopping the pumping and causing a collapse. 

If that doesn't convince you, if you think that economic booms and busts are not monetary but supply related, then you would still be wrong.  In terms of regulations, we have *more* regulations now than ever before.  The Federal Register, which tallies the amount of Federal regulations, now totals in excess of 70,000 pages.  And guess what?  10,000 pages have been added since 1979, the age that the ""most people"" you are talking about attribute as the ""age of Reaganesque deregulation"".

Look at the alphabet soup of regulatory agencies that have been expanded over the years.

Look at the amount of spending that the government's spending now makes up: 40%.  The government used to spend only 11% of total incomes.

Look at the bailouts, the SEC protecting fraudsters, etc etc.

What you need to understand is that regulations are actually designed to protect the established firms whose owners are friends with the politicians, against potential and current competition.  Regulations and big government favor big business over the ""little guy"".

&gt;We look back to other eras where government regulation was minimal or nonexistent, and sure enough, people were exploited and ultimately there was a collapse.

What?  The collapse of 1929 was caused by the Fed pumping in too much credit into the economy.  The Great Depression of the 1930s was caused by FDR and Hoover's spending and economic ""stimulus"" plans.  Go back further.  The collapse of 1921 was caused by the Fed inflating the money supply to pay for WW1 during the 1910s and distorting the structure of the economy.  Go back even further.  The panic of 1819 was caused by the government previously printing money to finance the war of 1812.

You may be ""looking"" at other eras, but you certainly aren't *learning* from other eras.

t5_6,,1425938844,"Summary: Efforts at censoring child porn will not work and it's really just a witch hunt anyway. Politicians and judges are in bed with the prison-industrial complex and only care about throwing as many people as possible into the clink. Groups, including law-enforcement and politicians, that ask for more intrusive monitoring in order to catch pedophiles are really trying to increase their power. Religious groups are some of the worst offenders. 

The author goes on to outline how pedophilia should be handled if we *really* wanted to limit child exploitation. 

In the beginning he summarizes the history of child porn and of the child porn industry - interesting by itself. 

BTW, I think this subject is interesting because people get all crazy about it. I don't understand that. I really don't care. I say sentence pedophiles to be public school teachers - because then your little brats would get lots of needed attention. 

Some highlights I liked:

&gt;A now-deceased Belgian psychoanalyst has also analyzed the phenomenon of so-called White marches and reactions of the public on child abuse. He came to very interesting results. Could it be that each of us harbours an unconscious, dark and unbearable desire for the child that one can ""unload"" by expressing and projecting anger towards a pedophile monster? Why is the public so eager to know EVERYTHING about cases of child abuse? The public leeches every perverse detail of such a story and the sensational media makes an excellent business. The most insidious of the whole subject of child pornography is the public discussion about things the speaker only has ideas about but has never seen. Each sensationalist presentation is allowed and there are no limits to it, and these presentations can be abused to achieve various objectives. It is not acceptable to tackle the issue with facts without getting charged for a criminal offense in Germany. It is like the ultimate indictment where no defense is allowed. It can be used for everything and every purpose.

...

&gt;Child protection has become a real industry. There are numerous organizations dedicated to the protection of the child - their administration, programs and staff must be funded - which means many job opportunities. I am particularly worried about the relationships between large and politically important global organizations such as the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Kids and fundamentalist-totalitarian-oriented religious groups. If you visit their website (www.missingkids.com) there is a CYBERTIPLINE. There is an opportunity to select a REPORTING CATEGORY. Under ""Unsolicited Obscene Material Sent to a Child"", there is a link to www.obscenitycrimes.org. This organization is, in turn, operated by Morality in Media, Inc. and is an essential partner of the Center. I quote here a few of the interesting arguments that this organization wants to spread and enforce (below, I have collected arguments from various pages in www.obscenitycrimes.org):
The police must do God's work (ie. the police becomes the executive branch of the Bible)
Pornography leads to violence and must be banned
Pornography leads to homosexuality and child abuse
Sexuality in marriage must be regulated (oral, anal and masturbation are against nature and are punishable)
Homosexuality should be criminalized
Adultery must be punishable
Adulterers are predetermined to abuse children
I stop here because otherwise I would burst with anger and bloodthirst. I noticed that these are the same religious fundamentalists that welcomed cruel punishment on children with rods, whips, etc. based on Bible verses such as Hebra 12:6-7 or 1 Book of Kings 12:13-14 and 12:18. The Western world hardly has to worry about the Talibans but more about Christian fundamentalists crawling in through the back door of ""Child protection"".

...

&gt;The United States is a respected democracy that over the years has permitted the use of torture - all this for a good cause and for the protection of the society. A prison society is growing quickly and is operated by the private sector. Approximately 2% of the population is serving a sentence, most of them in a prison. Private prison operators are even traded on the stock market and they are known to be very profitable and sustainable as more and more prisons are built and more and more people are put into prison (the amount of people in prison increases each year by 4%). ""Producing"" convicted criminals HAS BECOME A HIGHLY PROFITABLE INDUSTRY and more and more criminals have to be produced so that the money keeps coming. There are credible rumors of bribes from operators of the prison to the judges and prosecutors - they pay premiums for so-called new convictions that result in a prison stay. So you don't have to be so picky in any investigation, let alone employ qualified officers - this way there is always sufficient supply of people to put in prison - AND ESPECIALLY YOU HAVE TO CRIMINALIZE A LOT OF THINGS. Now, at this point, the reader should pause and do a little reflection on their part, and let this go once more through their brain. Beautiful, great democracy.

&gt;And because everything is pushed in the name of protecting the child, these children and young people feel better. Or do they? Oh, I forgot to mention something: the laws for the protection of children and adolescents are now used against them in many countries. Exactly, you did not misread that. This happens especially in the Ango-Saxian countries like the USA and the UK. Children who discover sexuality are arrested, convicted as pedophiles (!). Young lovers send pictures in which they wear nothing but underwear or even less - the so-called SEXTING. If the images end up in the public domain, this usually becomes disastrous for the youngsters. There are countless documented cases where both young people were convicted because of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY. There are also relations of minors with adults: a 17-year-old girl with a 18-year-old boy, for example. One such case is known to me from Ohio, where a 15-year-old girl was arrested and put in the prison was because she refused to testify against her 18-year-old boyfriend so that he could be convicted as a child abuser (because the parents of the girls have denounced him - he did not fit the taste of Mom and Dad. In one comment the parents said it is right that their daughter is sitting in prison because she did not want to charge his boyfriend). The laws allegedly made for protection of children and adolescents are increasingly used to criminalize and control the sexuality of children and adolescents - with the prosecution used even against the children and young people themselves. Interestingly, we come again to my earlier observation: children and young people are good enough to be punished, even convicted. But sexually they are totally immature and dumb. SOURCE: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28679588/

...

&gt;The criminalization of child pornography is one of the most stupid decisions ever made - for various reasons. First, the costs of prosecution for possession of child pornography are enormous for the state and often very little results are achieved and after all nothing can be changed about the actual fact that the crime has been committed. A friend's home was searched and had all his computers and 4500 video cassettes - on which he for years had recorded movies - taken. It took 2 years to work through them all and in the process a huge sum of taxpayers' money was spent FOR ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Because he had recorded TV movies on the video tapes! Germany is very rich, making expensive proceedings for child pornography. Put those who write horror stories and one-sided descriptions in the jail so that it becomes really expensive to the taxpayer [?]. Germany has enough money, so let's just do it.
Secondly, it is justified by the argument that viewing of a child porn picture harms the child. How? The actual exploitation has happened a long time ago!
Thirdly, by now it should be crystal clear to everyone that child pornography is the perfect weapon to ruin the lives of people (even those who are not pedophiles). Many innocent people already saw their existence get destroyed (one case among many is Landslide). I hope that soon these cases are brought before the European Court for Human Rights in Strasbourg and that the governments should be held accountable and financially bleed for the filth they have caused. Many have child pornography on their computers without knowing it (because of spam, or Trojans used to make the computer a proxy). CP is the perfect means to cause huge problems and social ostracism to an unpleasant person. And the government (and the child protection lobby) will use it as THE argument to decieve a totally unsuspecting population (and even parliamentarians). You have seen how the terrorism-argument has been misused. You can at least collect evidence and come up with counterarguments, etc. against terrorism. But child pornography is THE WEAPON against which one cannot give counter-arguments because it is totally illegal to do research in order to form a clear opinion. It can thus lead to wrongdoings, limit our civil rights and be used to push total monitoring of citizens. I suspect very strongly that the relevant government officials have at last dropped the penny. Child pornography can not really be stopped or the producers and operators cannot really be identified. So we filter it away so that the general population believes that something has been done. In the process the monitoring technology is set up and soon used for other purposes. Then it does not take much longer until it used for the prosecution of copyright violations and for controlling critical views. We can also send some love to Deutsche Telekom and Deutsche Bundesbahn. To me China is soon more secret than Germany.

Really? *terrorist*? Strange how wikipedia fails to mention anything about this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betar

&gt;banned in Israel, the United States, Britain, and just about every country on Earth

That's funny, seeing how wikipedia also details Betar activities - horrible atrocities like running sports clubs and organizing community activities - in US, Canada, UK, Australia.. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betar#Regional_Activities

And if you don't believe the famously Zionist-controlled Wikipedia, why Betar's own website proudly links to its chapters from Argentina to Ukraine: http://betar.org.il/en/content/view/28/9/

What does it say about you that you don't even bother to look up Wikipedia before you post such nonsense? Yeah, I know. I won't really make you reexamine your thinking. If you could do that you wouldn't be here in the first place.

Moving on, you mention Betar's horrible rule of fear in France
&gt;against French citizens who so much as speak the name of Israel.

Which somehow is at odds with what one knows about France, for example that tens of thousands of its citizens just recently protested against the Gaza invasion: http://www.france24.com/en/20090110-tens-thousands-protest-gaza-offensive-france-europe-israel

And, lastly, even if what you're saying about Betar was *remotely* true, even if it was all true, have you the slightest fucking clue what ""tactics of Hitler's SS"" even mean? Since Betar France, even according to your own wild claims, apparently don't massacre millions of people (or even one) and don't execute entire communities with machine guns, one thinks that they are quite far from SS tactics.

RAIL SUCKS. Big time. It is absolutely not the future. It is, by and large, a waste of money here in the US, because so few people use it. Why? Because people think it's faster to fly.

The Northeast Corridor is the best rail line I've been on in the US. And it's a piece of shit compared to Eurostar. The scenery is mostly urban decay. Constant rail switching, two engine changes, and 75 mph limits on more than half of the non-dedicated line (even on Acela) means it takes better than a working day to go from Boston to DC.

[And the time I got stuck in that central Jersey swamp for 6 hours with no power in the dead of winter? Lots of fun, there.]

Almost every other inter-city line in the US is hardly better than third-world rail. The only real advantages are cleaner and better maintained cars, people aren't crammed in like sardines and generally don't smell as bad either (esp compared to India). The ride, though, is slow and rocky. Tracks are primarily freightways, and it comes through loud and clear. Delays up to 4 hours because of freight are not uncommon.

Europe and Japan are very good, but not exceptional. Better ride and scheduling, but people are just as selfish and inconsiderate as in the US. Loud music, partying, obnoxious kids, people trying to rifle through your luggage or pick your pocket, etc, etc.

Mass transit only works in very high density areas, and occasionally between nearby cities. But rail transit will never be profitable again, unless aircraft are permanently grounded.

You think you can fix mass transit? Great. How many trillions do you want? And how many more billions in operating losses will be needed from our increased taxes? And just what percentage of the population will give up their cars for this gold-plated turd you call the future of transit?

t5_2cneq,,1425939264,"U.S.-Russian relations have hit a new post-Cold War low with Russian President Dmitriy Medvedev speaking out against U.S. policies on several contentious issues -- the Iranian nuclear conflict, the U.S. missile defense system in Eastern Europe and the unresolved status of Kosovo, to name just a few.

In the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. President Obama received steadfast claims of support from Putin. At the time, bound by a common enemy, relations between the countries were as strong as almost never before.

Yet ever since the U.S.-led war in Iraq, Moscow has distanced itself from Washington; with its emergence as an energy superpower and what it sees as NATO's expansion into Eastern Europe, the Russian bear is growling back and increasingly loud. 

Russia, a veto-holding member of the U.N. Security Council, backed two sets of limited U.N. sanctions against Iran but has resisted a third, tougher round of measures advocated by Washington.

Last week,  Medvedev -- in what Iranian commentators hailed as a historic sign of support -- visited Tehran to meet with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and other leaders of the Caspian Sea region. The visit came as U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney said the world could not stand by and allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon, with Obama making references to World War III if Iran continued to defy international calls to stop its uranium enrichment program.

The West believes Iran is using its civilian nuclear program as a coverup to secretly make nuclear weapons, a charge Tehran denies.

Washington has refused to rule out military action against Iran, and Putin, as if to torpedo those threats, handed Tehran an important security guarantee at the Caspian Sea leaders summit when he said that no Caspian government would allow its territories be used for a military attack against another Caspian state. The summit also marked the first time a Kremlin leader visited the Iranian capital since World War II, and it surfaced that Medvedev had invited Ahmadinejad to Moscow in return (that would also be a first).

While other European nations have spoken out against a U.S. first strike against Iran, the Caspian security guarantee directly undermines that measure, further fueling the tensions between Washington and Moscow.

Another issue where both powers are at loggerheads is the plan of a U.S. anti-missile system in Eastern Europe. Washington wants to station 10 interceptor missiles in Poland and a radar station in the Czech Republic to defend Europe and the United States against nuclear attacks from the likes of North Korea and Iran, a plan Moscow feels threatens its own security.

Medvedev and Obama telephoned each other earlier this week, yet a resolution to the controversy seems not in sight.

The same is true for a conflict that has been smoldering below the surface but could ignite any time. The breakaway Serbian province of Kosovo is pushing for independence, yet Serbia, backed almost exclusively by Moscow, is standing in the way of any progress on the issue.

Efforts to resolve Kosovo's status have culminated in U.N.-led compromise talks based on a proposal drafted by U.N. special envoy Martti Ahtisaari, former president of Finland.

The so-called Ahtisaari plan would have stipulated broad independence for Kosovo (without explicitly naming the devil) and secured rights and protection for the Serb minority living in the province.

However, talks based on the Ahtisaari plan between Belgrade and Pristina, observed by the larger Contact Group -- comprising the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia -- earlier this year ended without result.

Several EU and G8 summits have failed to make any headway on Kosovo, and observers expect the conflict between Russia and the United States over the Serbian province's status to become nasty by the end of the year.

""At some point in time -- sooner rather than later -- you've got to say: 'Enough is enough. Kosovo is independent,' and that's the position we've taken,"" Obama said in June during a visit to Albania.

Observers are worried that an ongoing Kosovo row carries negative implications for the entire Balkans.

""Solving the Kosovo issue is key to stability and security in the Balkans,"" a senior Western diplomat said earlier this year in Berlin. ""If Kosovo becomes unstable, then things in Macedonia may unravel, and so on. ... Kosovo must not become a frozen conflict.""

t5_2qh1s,,1425939301,"These responses are getting quite long, but it is good to debate someone who can actually defend what they stand for instead of just spouting nonsense. That doesn't mean you are right though :P

&gt;Well that's fine, but it leaves our nation less competitive. How many foreigners get degrees and leave? How do we cope with companies increasingly externalizing the costs, while real wages have fallen since the 70s? Why would a (successful)car company build a factory here, when it could do in Canada and not have to pay health care cost of workers?

There are two problems with this response. The first is that in the government I support we would have a lot less regulations and taxes. This would make companies a lot more likely to stay. Under the current system, you have a lot of regulations, yet these companies still outsource. I support a very limited gov't which would allow these companies to keep more of their profits and they would be more willing to stay, especially compared to the regulations that other countries have. With small gov't comes few taxes and that will benefit everyone without distorting the markets- I am for no corporate tax, no income tax, and overall just a lot less taxes. This is what attracts business, not regulating them and trying to penalize them for leaving because in the end they will either suffer here or end up leaving anyway.

The second flaw (atleast I see it as a flaw :P) with this response was in what you believe the gov't should do. I believe the gov't should only be there to protect us. If a company or people want to leave why shouldn't they be able to do so. Isn't it their choice? Isn't that a part of being free? Anyway, under limited gov't those people and businesses are likely to stay due to less regulation. Before you bring up the labor argument let me say that I support unions, as long as they are voluntary, and workers in a small gov't situation would be able to compete for wages driven by the laws of supply and demand so long as the country protects the borders (also a part of natl security) from illegal aliens.

&gt;That's not really true, Medicare expenditures have grown more slowly than private sector. We already pay far more per capita than any other industrialized nation on health care, and get much worse results. Most studies suggest, we'd save money by switching to a single payer system. It seems silly to be against a system that would deliver more and cost less. As one business group has said, ""America's health care system has become a liability in a global economy.""

I don't want to get into this too much because healthcare is another huge debate and I have to get back to doing some work soon, but that study is obviously not something everyone agrees with. Also, the big problem with universal healthcare is that it is just too costly over time and gov'ts end up having to continue to raise taxes to support it. Also, the quality and waiting times are worse. Look at the wait times for simple surgeries in Canada and the UK and you will see what I mean. Also, look at the amount of their income that goes to healthcare. I would much rather have a free market system in which there would be more competition and hence reduction of prices. Our current system is so expensive because it favors certain parts of the market, like insurance companies, and that makes it very expensive for consumers. We need to get rid of these barriers and costs will automatically go down.
&gt;Why does not so free China have better growth than free India?

Actually, China is pretty capitalist even though their political system is communist. Also, their manufacturing output is higher, which leads to a lot more growth. India is still a lot more agricultural percentage wise. 

&gt;Ah, so the only reason were a super power is not because our economic system is better, but because the other ones systems got destroyed? Also the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe, wasn't very capitalistic, it was a bailout, and a successful one at that.

When they got destroyed it paved the way for us to step us as a superpower and no that is not the only reason, but part of it. The other is the industrial revolution we experienced where we had great manufacturing growth.

As for the Marshall plan, it is arguable how much it was responsible for the bounce-back of Europe. I understand why people may think bailouts are good, but what if they fail? That is what people fail to think about. If the European nations weren't able to bounce back then what would have happened to our investment? We would have lost it. What happens if GM or anyone else who received a bailout uses the money and still can't come back? We lose the money. That is the real problem with bailouts. They can work, but there is a good risk that they won't either, which I feel is not really fair to the American people since its their money. Capitalism needs failure in order to live and bailouts do not support capitalism.

&gt;That's how taxation works, whether it's defense or education. Pushing the tax burden to the poor is a terrible idea, which is also why a lot of people are against regressive taxes.

Yes taxes on the poor are bad, but again under a small government system like I would want, everyone would have drastically lower taxes.

&gt;Not really, the Republicans buried a Congressional Research Report they themselves commissioned that showed the opposite. Food stamps were actually shown to be most effective, health care after that. We're not subsidized the dying, we're trying to soften the crash. What subsidized dying parts are you referring to? We've been too afraid to nationalize the banks and look where that's got us. Yes, the auto industry is a disaster. Why would you cut spending, when you could use it for job retraining, or create long lasting infrastructure that is beneficial to both the community and business?

What report are you referring to? Socialism may help in the short term, there is no doubt about that, but in the long run it can be treacherous. The subsidized dying parts are all the bailed out companies like GM. It would be better to let them fail and let successful competitors take over. Do you know that Toyota, Hyandai, and Honda all have American plants? Demand for their cars would go up and they would hire more Americans and all that without American taxpayers taking the bill.

Nationalizing the banks is very bad because again, it reduces our freedoms and encourages bad behavior. Freddie and Fannie are essentially nationalized banks and look how they turned out.

And the reason I would cut spending is because WE DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY. This debt isn't just a number, it is something we will have to pay and when that day comes I guarantee you that all of these big gov't programs will have to be slashed.

Anyway, it all comes down to ideologies and what we believe the government should be. I believe in freedom and what the Constitution and our founding fathers believed in and you believe in a controlled state, where the government essentially babies the people one way or another (nationalized banks, food stamps, etc- all of that is still being babied because the gov't obviously doesn't trust it in the hands of the people.)",,t1_c08bie1,False,,t1_c08bfqq,0,1,c08bie1,Economics,0,True,1,0,t3_85dnr,myp415,1237416758,False

I don't know why, but most Europeans I see have a more pink glow to their skin than do many Americans. When I was in Europe, I thought many of the men looked as if they were wearing lipstick or something, but it's probably a result of better blood flow (?). And finally, Europeans tend to have some really amazing eyebrows. Maybe it's only the places I've been, but many Europeans I've seen have thicker eyebrows and older Europeans men tend to have really wild eyebrows.

Let's also not forget that quite a few of these countries are oil producing OPEC countries, so they should have some experience with fair(!) prices in energy distribution. Then again, you could argue that the OPEC and solar deal only benefit a few rich people in those countries and that the general population doesn't benefit from it at all.

The contaminated product, a mix of H3N2 seasonal flu viruses and unlabelled H5N1 viruses, was supplied to an Austrian research company. The Austrian firm, Avir Green Hills Biotechnology, then sent portions of it to sub-contractors in the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Germany.

The contamination incident, which is being investigated by the four European countries, came to light when the subcontractor in the Czech Republic inoculated ferrets with the product and they died. Ferrets shouldn’t die from exposure to human H3N2 flu viruses.

A different frat was on every street corner, in the frat area of town, with at least a dozen kegs per day, giving it out for free to anyone who walked by. We went to all the parades, saw many boobies, and managed to not get arrested. All of us were underage at the time but no one ever carded us.

I traveled across China by train alone in 2005 for about two months. I made friends along the way and also met with various friends from Europe who live in China now.

While in Xi'an I saw the terracotta warriors, absolutely amazing.

But what are we to do about Columbus Day?

I *hate* that Columbus Day is a national holiday. Because it's instituted by the government, it's just some watered down vague historical observation that we inexplicably get the day off of work from. Apparently celebrating history means not going to the post office. 

But as a cultural holiday, it's rich and interesting and worth observing. 

Yeah, I think maybe that's the main reason I don't think the government should be involved in institutionalizing these sorts of holidays-- because the government is perceived as the power structure, and maybe perceives itself as the power structure, it has to be very bland and equivocal and boring when it comes to celebrating culture.

This backlash against the extremely rich that are being handed out money now for the bailout, wouldn’t this lead to a shift of the public towards creating a society like Marx envisioned?

 A society that is held by the workers, rather than the extremely rich seems more likely an idea these days in comparison. 

We’ve seen this general shift in our dislike of every business man from Wall St. and large companies. 
This is just a humble idea, as the bailouts simply reflect not a socialistic society, but rather a mix of socialism and capitalism where the Government is subsidizing these very large companies and as such, breaking down the basic idea of a Darwinian Capitalistic Business structure that we have in America and in Europe.

&gt; And what about me, I'm not religous, I'm an individual with my own unique and distinct beliefs, thoughts and actions, where is my country? Why do you need your own country? The gypsies don't, nor do hundreds of other distinct and original groups of people. Jews live happily all over the world, yet jewish people in the jewish homeland seem to be the ones who are unhappy?

This is a very good question. The honest answer to it is that jewish people believed themselves to be a people, and dreamt about their own nation ever since the exile from Palestine, so eventually they found the strength and dedication to return and create one. Jews, especially religious jews, are very xenophobic, because they are conscious to the opposition their culture meets - mainly because of religious prejudice, but often just plain racism and ignorance (e.g. jews plotting things). So objectively, collective dedication, dedication and faith (not as in religious faith) created a force of arms sufficient to sustain a sovereign state.

But what justifies the existence of Jewish state in the eyes of others? Jews have a common history, rich of brilliant thought and contribution, and most of which is recorded with excruciating precision, literally thousands of years of distinct culture, an indistinguishable part of which was always the return to the place where jewish people came from. In the late 18th century jews finally understood that assimilation is destroying these cultural riches. The two centuries of european and russian persecution that followed only contributed to their flight. So when you question whether jews really are sufficiently a people to be granted their own country, you're indirectly denying all these things - more likely than not out of ignorance and not malice, but still things familiar to most of jews in great detail.",,t1_c08coaj,False,,t1_c08cema,0,1,c08coaj,worldnews,0,True,1,0,t3_85w1m,MikeSeth,1237556250,False

It's my firm belief that this trend will manifest itself in the US. Those lacking conviction will drift away from churches unable to supply them with an doctrinal and theological foundation which can stand up to even the most casual cross examination, whilst those of sincere belief will reject the childish, hectoring and ultimately intellectually feeble ideas espoused by their clownish, corrupt leaders -in favour of more serious minded and politically quietist reformed theology.

t5_2qh0s,,1425941170,"I think you base your understanding of America off of TV and reddit far too much.

&gt;1) There's still a very strong antipathy to socialised medicine in the States, whereas any party that even suggested privatising our system would find it impossible to get elected.

For starters, this is seem as an economic matter, and not a political one. Here it's mostly about what it will cost and whether or not it could be implemented while still maintaining an Americans ability to choose which doctor to see and things related to that. It's a very practical discussion. A lot of the discussion you see in Washington is different than the discussion most Americans actually have on the subject. You have the die hard party hard-liners who will repeat the same junk over and over and try to apply principle to this issue even though there is nothing in Americas founding ideals that says anything about state provided insurance/health care. When you watch Washington too much you start to believe that Americans *are* comprised of republicans and democrats, and we're not. (I'll get to this in another section).

Its entirely possible that we implement a kind of health care system, state or federally run, we are just exploring the most practical ways of doing it and making sure we still maintain certain freedom of movement, if you will, under it. As it is, our social programs like the ones that provide money to elderly retired folks and the poor take up half of our budget or more and don't have the money to cover what these people need already. So basically, it's a logistical problem for us, not a political one.

&gt;2) Religion plays so large a role in American politics that it's extremely difficult to get elected to office if one isn't a Christian. In Canada, on the other hand, most people don't know or care what religion a politician is. Actually, that's not quite right: Most Canadians in fact tend to get suspicious if a candidate is too outwardly religious. Apart from in some rural areas, mentioning God in a campaign speech would be an excellent way to lose votes. In any case, religion is a very important factor in the States when it comes to social policy -- abortion, sex education, criminalisation of ""immoral"" behaviour like drug use, etc. -- whereas in Canada it's not.

Believe it or not, religion really isn't as big a deal as most media outlets want you to think either. For them it's just another attempt at creating drama to pull in the viewers. The majority of Americans don't care much. They would like a person to hold certain values, sure, but that's more a reflection on a persons character than anything. The only people that truly care about a mans religion are the fundamentalist Christians and even though they're loud and make a lot of noise during election season, they're not a large group in the US and each passing decade the US becomes less religious.

&gt;3) The US is a much more individualistic society, where personal success and the ""American Dream"" take on great importance. Canadians, on the other hand, tend to be more interested in the collective good, and tend not to much mind things like, say, higher taxes, if they are likely to improve the society as a whole.

I's true, we are more individualistic, and even I find that to be a good thing. It is bad, however, when it's mistaken to mean selfish. Americans used to be individualist but worked towards the common good. Canadians, as well as Europeans, work and think more in groups to work towards a majority or class' good. Americans have a strong history of protecting the minority groups (and I'm not just talking race or class, but any group that has a minority view or opinion) and thus we don't push things through as often in the name of some sort of utilitarian good. This, I think, would be the biggest difficulty in having Canadians and Americans come together.

&gt;4) There's much more loyalty to political parties in the States, whereas it's more common in Canada for voters to change their allegiances from election to election, or to vote for one party federally and another one provincially. Having more than 2 parties makes ""strategic voting"" an important consideration in all elections. (i.e., voting for a party not so much because one supports its policies, but to prevent a particular other party from winning the seat.)

The influence of political parties is waning, and though there are those who are party people, there aren't many hard liners. A parliamentary system and our republican system is different when it comes to parties, we can vote on multiple people for multiple positions (also because we're a federation). So even though a person is registered to a certain party, they vote however they want, generally voting for people on both sides of the isle for different positions. In my state I think that people registered to parties is down to 60% and 40% of voters being independent or unrelated to any party. And this is a growing trend, especially among young people. I would even imagine that among those 60% that are registered, most of them are only registered that way because they registered as their parents were when they came of voting age and haven't bothered to change. Most, I'm sure vote for people from both sides, as I said before, depending on the election. I foresee the way in which voting is done in the US changing in the not to distant future (next few decades).

&gt;5) In everything except perhaps fiscal matters, we are much more liberal than Americans. There are many examples of this, but it was made most clear to me when I heard that a lot of Americans think that CNN is a ""left-leaning"" network, whereas Canadians tend to find it far too conservative for their tastes. Of course, if we could get Fox up here, it would just make our heads explode ... :)

Again, I think you've either seen too much TV or read too many redditors or republicans comments. The most vocal in the US aren't necessarily the majority, In fact, the more vocal they are, the bigger chance it is that they're a minority.

I would argue greatly that the United States is much more liberal on liberties (with a huge exception to the last 8 god-awful years) though I don't imagine Canada is really that far behind, relatively speaking. I'm not only referring to how we are at the moment but how things could potentially be, protections in government, and the like.

Now I know a few Canadians and even have one as a professor for my International Political Economy course and, maybe these are exceptions but, he seems pretty moderate when it comes to politics, not very ideological at least. 

When the left/right spectrum is brought up, it's generally refering to an economic spectrum as opposed to a political one. And given that case, yes Canada is much more ""liberal"" than the United States. But and I don't mean to sound nationalistic or anything here, there are very few countries who afford, and protect though a Constitution, the civil liberties that we do. While other countries generally have as many or most of the freedoms we have, theirs can more easily be taken away. While Bush did some things that we find outrageous, to be honest, they didn't affect but a few individuals, while that's not right, obviously, and I don't condone his actions, the fact is, my liberties during his time weren't, in reality, effected. Granted, the possibility (the very real one) that they could have been, was greater during his period in office. But because Americans hold the Constitution in almost divine regard, he would have been hard pressed to exploit his powers any further.

t5_2fwo,,1425941170,"&gt; Although the correct solution to not being able to develop working software isn't ""then don't change anything""; it's ""then learn how to make software that isn't broken"".

It's not really that Microsoft can't make software that works, it's that they trip over themselves to make sure that the program you bought for Windows n works on Windows n-1. You can imagine that adding yet another dependency like a common update framework that large, commercial apps would likely misuse (via undocumented APIs and stupid code) would slow Microsoft down even further. Remember, people will be pissed if their copy of Crysis won't update correctly after they upgrade to Windows n+1. And who will be blamed? Microsoft.

&gt; Yeah, maybe. I'd make the argument that certain functionality ought to be in the core OS.

Like a web browser? You know, something people need to connect to the web? Talk to the EU about that one. Somewhere, somebody will have a problem with an update framework in the OS and will sue. Whether or not they win is another matter, but it's yet another bad PR story for Microsoft.

&gt;If Microsoft provides a standard mechanism for 3rd party apps to do updates, it does not mean that...

So I think maybe we should clarify what we're talking about Microsoft implementing here. I was under the assumption that it was a way to leverage the Microsoft Update framework for 3rd party apps. In that case, everything would go through the Windows Update widget in the control panel. At least that's always the argument I've heard: ""Why can't Windows Update tell me there's an update for Adobe Reader?"" That's what I'm arguing against here, even though it really does sound pleasant. If that were the case, then yes, Microsoft would have to host the updates (can't trust the security of 3rd party servers) and own the services that check for updates.

However, you seem to be arguing more for an API that allows developers to check for an update in a standardized way and then apply said update in a standardized way. That's more reasonable. However, I'm not sure of the good that such a service would provide. Checking for needed updates is as easy as pinging a file on a web server. There's nothing hard about that. I'm also afraid the binary layout of each app on the system is sufficiently different that there wouldn't be an easy abstraction that an API could provide for updates. What if the app is written in Python or needs an update to the JVM or something? Maybe this is something that could be built into .NET so that all .NET applications get the added bonus of an update UI since the way the app is compiled is standard (or at least known by the compiler) across all .NET applications. That would be an interesting idea and a way to keep developers interested in the .NET platform.

&gt;Then why do they screw it up about 99% of the time?

I reject this assertion too. I can't remember the last time I updated an app and it totally broke. Probably back in the Windows XP days. Off the top of my head, updates to the following apps have gone smooth as silk for me, at least in recent memory: Chrome (especially), VLC, Zune, Pidgin, Adobe Reader, IE, uTorrent, Windows Live suite, Quicken (2008), Firefox, TrueCrypt, FileZilla.

&gt;One notification with all my updates is much more convenient than a separate notification (on a separate day) for each update.

I'd recommend FileHippo.com. They have a great little scanner that runs in the background and checks for app updates. Every system start it lets you know with a little balloon that there are updates waiting. You can also run it on demand. You then go to their website and it shows you all the updates you need. It's nice because it doesn't require any action by the app developers. Let me know what you think.",,t1_c08dlc7,False,,t1_c08dkgx,0,1,c08dlc7,programming,0,True,1,0,t3_86cq5,pjakubo86,1237670974,True

Well, I'd like to hear the testimony itself, and not something based on it. English media was flooded with cut-up, misedited and mistranslated articles based on what Haaretz published. I've already seen articles in european media saying that the woman who was crossing the path was 100 yards away even though it clearly says ""meters"" in the original one.

&gt; I have the factual basis that ""dozens"" of soldiers were interviewed, and that out of this came one account of an old woman being shot, one account of a mother and two children being shot, one account of standing orders to enter houses and kill all in inhabitants, one account of rabbis encouraging holy war, and one account of soldiers expressing a desire to kill anyone in Gaza city.

This is true, but the US has a sort of reverse problem.

Since the USD is a reserve currency that has allowed the Fed to inflate fairly substantially - while keeping the inflation within the US confined to only 3% per year. A large percentage of the USD in the world is outside of the continental US, its in banks in Middle East, Asia, Latin America, Europe, etc. Essentially, we have been *exporting* our inflation (eg. that inflation was spread amongst 6B people instead of 330M Americans)

As the dollar index continues to drop - and as the Fed dilutes it more - this will force other countries to drop the USD as a reserve currency.

Once that happens *ALL* of that inflated currency will be flowing back into the US. Therefore both the quantity and the velocity of USD will massively increase within the continental US.

Right, because it would be so much easier to evacuate all of north-western Ukraine if the population was running around in panic. When a catastrophe happens and you need to get the people out of there quickly, this would be the very last thing you'll want. Especially when they have no means of transportation other than the, at the moment re-routed for evacuation, train system and their bicycles.

Whether you like the Soviets or not, you should give them the credit for taking proper measures *after* the incident happened.

Getting out pregnant women and infants as far away as possible was paramount, which is exactly what they did. They were informed in the entire region of Ukraine, immediately put on trains and transported to Crimea, where they were stationed for the next few days. Schools handed out iodine tablets, the traffic was blocked away and so forth. Even years later (and I think this still applies for modern Ukraine), those who were born between 1985 and early 1987 received better healthcare along with other bonuses.

As for the people who died there, it's tragic, but they knew very well what they were doing. Firemen, helicopter pilots, the army. There are quite a few documentaries and interviews with these people before they headed out on their last mission. These are the people who gave up their lives so that many others, not only in the USSR but larger parts of Western Europe as well, could live (this includes some of you, redditors). There was no other option. No magic way to seal the reactor, no special suits that protected from this degree of ration, nothing.

The Koran was written 600 years after Christianity started and contains interesting cometary on the bible stories. But when read with the right perspective is pretty interesting. 

So it is written that:

Allah is truth &amp; Allah is unknowable. 

This fits in with the height of philosophical thinking: The only thing that might be known is that nothing can be known. After that is admitted then you stop being a philosopher and start being a scientist.

Now before I lose the reader, think of this: three hundred years **after** the Koran was written, the scientific center of the world was Arabia. If you look up at the night sky, the constellations are named with roman names, but the stars themselves are named with Arabic names. 

So what happened:

Three hundred years later and six hundred years after the Koran, the great library in Spain, which at the time was Arab territory, fell to the Europeans and was burned to the ground. Not to long after that the great library of Baghdad fell to the Mongolians. Then the great library of Egypt. After that everything turned to crap in the area.

We in the west feel that the library of Alexandria being burned was perhaps the greatest tragedy to scientific advance. But these three libraries being burned is perhaps the greatest set of bad luck suffered by any great civilization and the repercussions are felt to this day.

So with all the great libraries gone there were only two main books which the people of the area had to really work with. One was the Koran and the other was a book that told people to shut up and read before doing any more experiments.

This proved to be problematic for reasons which at this time should be all to obvious.

[bullshit](http://www.purefood.org/rBGH/rach593.html).  The EU has banned it in Europe, and nobody really knows whether or not it's actually safe because Monsanto has paid people off to bury any details of the studies, most of which are incomplete.  And Monsanto stacked the FDA with it's own paid shills prior to pushing the approval of the stuff through.

Two veteran news reporters for Fox TV in Tampa, Florida have been fired for refusing to water down an investigative report on Monsanto's controversial milk hormone, rBGH (recombinant bovine growth hormone).

Monsanto's rBGH is a genetically-engineered hormone sold to dairy farmers, who inject it into their cows every two weeks to increase milk production. In recent years, evidence has accumulated indicating that rBGH may promote cancer in humans who drink milk from rBGH-treated cows. It is the link between rBGH and cancer that Fox TV tried hardest to remove from the story.

** rBGH was never properly tested before FDA allowed it on the market. A standard cancer test of a new human drug requires two years of testing with several hundred rats. But rBGH was tested for only 90 days on 30 rats.

This short-term rat study was submitted to FDA but was never published. FDA has refused to allow anyone outside FDA to review the raw data from this study, saying it would ""irreparably harm"" Monsanto.[2] Therefore the linchpin study of cancer and rBGH has never been subjected to open scientific peer review.

** Some Florida dairy herds grew sick shortly after starting rBGH treatment. One farmer, Charles Knight --who lost 75% of his herd --says on camera that Monsanto and Monsanto-funded researchers at University of Florida withheld from him the information that other dairy herds were suffering similar problems. He says Monsanto and the university researchers told him only that he must be doing something wrong.

** The law required Monsanto to notify the FDA if they received complaints by dairy farmers such as Charles Knight. But four months after Knight complained to Monsanto, FDA had heard nothing from Monsanto. Monsanto's explanation? Despite a series of visits to Knight's farm, and many phone conversations, Monsanto officials say it took them four months to figure out that Knight was complaining about rBGH.

** Monsanto claims on camera that every truckload of milk is tested for excessive antibiotics --but Florida dairy officials and scientists on camera say this is simply not true.

** Monsanto says on camera that Canada's ban on rBGH has nothing to do with human health concerns --but Canadian government officials speaking on camera say just the opposite.

** Canadian government officials, speaking on camera, say they believe Monsanto tried to bribe them with offers of $1 to $2 million to gain approval for rBGH in Canada. Monsanto officials say the Canadians misunderstood their offer of ""research"" funds.

** Monsanto officials claim on camera that ""the milk has not changed"" because of rBGH treatment of cows. As noted earlier, there is abundant evidence --some of it from Monsanto's own studies --that this is definitely not true.

** On camera, a Monsanto official claims that Monsanto has not opposed dairy co-ops labeling their milk as ""rBGH-free."" But this is definitely not true. Monsanto brought two lawsuits against dairies that labeled their milk ""rBGH- free."" Faced with the Monsanto legal juggernaut, the dairies folded and Monsanto then sent letters around to other dairy organizations announcing the outcome of the two lawsuits --in all likelihood, for purposes of intimidation. (Conveniently, the FDA regulations that discourage labeling of milk as ""rBGH-free"" were written by Michael Taylor, an attorney who worked for Monsanto both before and after his tenure as an FDA official. (See REHW #381.)

At the web site www.foxbghsuit.com, you will find the version of the Wilson/Akre rBGH series as it was re-written by Fox's attorneys. It has been laundered and perfumed. Most importantly, nearly all of the references to cancer have been removed from the script. Instead of cancer we now have ""human health effects"" --whatever those may be.

The Wilson/Akre lawsuit comes at an especially good time to publicize the relationship between rBGH and human cancer because new evidence has come to light.

When a cow is injected with rBGH, its milk production is stimulated, but not directly. The presence of rBGH in the cow's blood stimulates production of another hormone, called Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1, or IGF-1 for short. It is IGF-1 that stimulates milk production.

IGF-1 is a naturally-occurring hormone-protein in both cows and humans.[3] The IGF-1 in cows is chemically identical to the IGF-1 in humans.[4] The use of rBGH increases the levels of IGF-1 in the cow's milk, though the amount of the increase is disputed. Furthermore, IGF-1 in milk is not destroyed by pasteurization. Because IGF-1 is active in humans--causing cells to divide --any increase in IGF-1 in milk raises obvious questions: will it cause inappropriate cell division and growth, leading to growth of tumors?

The Council on Scientific Affairs of the American Medical Association formally expressed concern about IGF-1 related to rBGH in 1991, saying, ""Further studies will be required to determine whether ingestion of higher than normal concentrations of bovine insulin-like growth factor [IGF-1] is safe for children, adolescents, and adults.""[5]

Monsanto's public position since 1994 has been that IGF-1 is not elevated in the milk from rBGH-treated cows --despite its own studies to the contrary. For example, writing in the British journal, LANCET, in 1994, Monsanto researchers said ""...IGF-1 concentration in milk of rBST-treated cows is unchanged,"" and ""...there is no evidence that hormonal content of milk from rBST-treated cows is in any way different from cows not so treated.""[6] [Monsanto calls rBGH rBST (recombinant bovine somatotropin), thus avoiding use of the word 'hormone.'] However, in a published letter, the British researcher T. B. Mepham reminded Monsanto that in its 1993 application to the British government for permission to sell rBGH in England, Monsanto itself reported that ""the IGF-1 level went up substantially [about five times as much].""[7] The U.S. FDA acknowledges that IGF-1 is elevated in milk from rBGH-treated cows.[4] Other proponents of rBGH acknowledge that it at least doubles the amount of IGF-1 hormone in the milk.[8] The earliest report in the literature found that IGF-1 was elevated in the milk of rBGH-treated cows by a factor of 3.6.[9]

Does IGF-1 promote cancer? In January of this year a Harvard study of 15,000 white men published in SCIENCE reported that those with elevated --but still normal --levels of IGF-1 in their blood are 4 times as likely as average men to get prostate cancer.[1] The SCIENCE report ends saying, ""Finally, our results raise concern that administration of GH [growth hormone] or IGF-1 over long periods, as proposed for elderly men to delay the effects of aging, may increase risk of prostate cancer."" By analogy, Monsanto's current efforts to increase the IGF-1 levels in America's milk supply raise the question: if little boys drink milk from rBGH-treated cows over long periods, will the elevated levels of IGF-1 increase their prostate cancer rates? This is not a question that should be answered by a wholesale experiment on the American people --but that is precisely what Monsanto is currently doing.

1.The EU banned it, true enough.  The only public reason given is for the welfare of the cows.  Which is scientifically valid, if not a reason I personally would ban it.  While a lot of innuendo suggests that the EU banned it for some ill effect in man, they actually decided ""The FDA’s determination that food products derived from cows treated with rBST are safe for consumers has been supported by numerous scientific and regulatory bodies. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), which consists of an international panel of experts in
the field of toxicology and chemistry in animal drug residues, has concluded it safe (see the report of
the 50th meeting held in Rome between February 17-26, 1998). Also, the report of the Royal College
of Physicians and surgeons of Canada (Expert Panel on Human Safety of rBST) concluded that no
public health issue was involved with the use of rBST.""  Citing that for the human health concerns, the EU decided to ban rBST for the health of the animals.
2.Monsanto has some shady business practices - highly likely and at least once proven that I know of.  Did it truly effect the FDA's decision?  Doubtful.  IF you haven't, look at the series in SCIENCE (you won't get a higher standard, the National Academy of Science is as good as it gets) published right before and after its approval.
3.""It is the link between rBGH and cancer that Fox TV tried hardest to remove from the story.""  That's probably because there is no scientific reason to believe this milk causes any more cancer than the non-treated cow milk.  IF I were Monsanto, I would sue them to for presenting such an obvious canard as a fact.
4.  Hence, it really shouldn't need to prove it is ""safe"" in the same sense a drug does, since it has about the same amounts of the same stuff as other milk.  They tested it, anyway, and found no problems.  Facts, which put the lie to several of the subsequent claims.
 5.""This short-term rat study was submitted to FDA but was never published.""  Actually, it was published in SCIENCE on August 24, 1990 in vol.249.  Ostensibly, it met SCIENCE's peer-review process, which is the most rigorous in the world.
6.THe FDA has refused to let anyone else look at it.  Well, let's see, does anyone include, say, Health Canada?  Where do you think the ""Canadian gov't officials"" who you cite got their info?  That study, of course.  And, unlike the published analysis, they had the raw data.  Their criticism, unlike what is implied by the comments you make, is that further study should be done on certain issues and that they felt undue pressure and inducment by Monsanto.

Can you show me where it is disputed in a reputable scientific journal that the increase is minor?  I really want to know.  Because, every primary source (Meaning scientific study as opposed to claims) I can find suggests that the level found in untreated and treated cows milk are very similar and far lower than the levels produced endogenously in the human GI tract.  Of course, I'm probably just being duped by that evil Monsanto.
8.""Does IGF-1 promote cancer? In January of this year a Harvard study of 15,000 white men published in SCIENCE reported that those with elevated --but still normal --levels of IGF-1 in their blood are 4 times as likely as average men to get prostate cancer.[1] The SCIENCE report ends saying, ""Finally, our results raise concern that administration of GH [growth hormone] or IGF-1 over long periods, as proposed for elderly men to delay the effects of aging, may increase risk of prostate cancer."" By analogy, Monsanto's current efforts to increase the IGF-1 levels in America's milk supply raise the question: if little boys drink milk from rBGH-treated cows over long periods, will the elevated levels of IGF-1 increase their prostate cancer rates? This is not a question that should be answered by a wholesale experiment on the American people --but that is precisely what Monsanto is currently doing. It is difficult to put a happy face on this, try as Fox might.""  
This brings up the further question, why should we allow milk to be sold at all?  Since it, not just milk from treated cows MAY cause cancer?  While you are banning regular, untreated milk because it too, can't be shown to be safe, you should remember, of course, that humans make a lot of IGF-1 in their guts alone, a lot more than they get from treated or untreated milk.

As an aside, I noticed that SCIENCE is a good enough journal and read by whoever the original author of these comments was, except, apparently, when it is used to vindicate rBST.

If you think a bit deeper, the reason is that Socialism arrived to America as an offshot of Liberalism: big-government policies in American are basically supposed to ""level the playing field"" for a distinctly individualist pursuit of pleasure and gratification.

In Europe Socialist policies are more directly rooted in Marxism - especially in France, the most popular intellectuals f.e. Badiou are still very Marxist. Now I hate Marxism as much as the next guy - even more, given that I was born in a Communist country - but there is one thing you can say in favour of it: it's not liberal, it's not focusing on an individual pursuit of pleasure, it generally has more restrictive, communitarian and conservative tendencies. 

Thus, the end result is that in Sweden or Germany f.e. you get a generous unemployment insurance but the state will really try to pressure you hard back to the job again. It's not Liberal Socialism, it's a kinda a conservative Socialism, nut just a nurturing mother, but a stict father too.

Now, in Britain or California the unemployment money may be less generous, but they are basically just shoveling money out the door. They are not really trying to force people to work again because they have this sort of ""Liberal Socialist"" view, of just helping people but not controlling them.

""These economic times are scary and who knows where we're heading. But it's dangerous to measure where we're at today by the unrealistic high a year ago, which was the result of years of goosing our economy to make us believe we're wealthier than we are. I could say our tours are down 30 percent. And they are. But that's not really true. Our tours are below the impossible height they reached last year. But they shouldn't have been that high anyway. We're taking 8,000 people instead of 12,000 people to Europe this year. And that's OK.

A headline today said, ""Americans lose 18 percent of their wealth."" Well, no, it wasn't real wealth, it was a bubble. You're down 18 percent? You're not. It shouldn't have been up there in the first place. So get over it. Shut up. Go to work, produce stuff that has value. I really think the days are gone, I hope, when people can rearrange the furniture and get rich on it. You got to produce something.

The interesting thing is we're all in it together. What I'm sad about is that when America catches a cold, the developing world catches pneumonia. And that's happened now. And a lot of Americans are feeling sorry for themselves because they can't have that fancy whatever-they were-going-to-get. But they have to remember that the gap between the haves and have-nots is even more pronounced and more desperate now.

If you have been living in the UK legitimately e.g. with a work permit (except for student visas) for 5 years then you gain your indefinite leave to remain, which is currently one year but this period may get extended to 3 years.  Once that period is over, you can gain citizenship.  Only once you're a UK passport holder can you work anywhere else in the EU.

In the UK this process from when you land until you get your ILR and then citizenship took 5 years, now it's 6-8 years.  Ireland and Netherlands is about 5 years still, but that might change.  Most English speaking work is in the UK, though Ireland is not totally averse to foreigners.

On the other hand, unlike the US, if you marry an EU (or EEA) citizen, you can immediately work in the same country as that citizen.  If you're married to someone from France and you are both living in France then you can work there for who you please.  If both of you move to the UK, as long as your spouse is either employed, self employed or a student, or a job seeker in the UK, then you are allowed to work in the UK too.  Another new EU rule is that if the two of you have been married for 3 years, the EU country you spent your most recent 12 months in will give you a right of residence in that country which you can't lose even if you get divorced.  There's also another rule which may backfire, but basically if you have a child with an EU citizen, that child is automatically an EU citizen and if you are the parent looking after that child then you gain most of the same working rights, and you can even move with that child through the EU.

And honestly, I'm not saying I'm 100% in favor of this view, or of Rothbard's particular vision, but this book raises some questions that I think liberals and conservatives should at least be able to answer.

To answer simply, is Afghanistan much better off with a central government? I think that the warlords, and the totalitarian Taliban government, are both telling of their society, not of any political system. That is to say, if the US were to dissolve, I don't think we would end up with warlords like Afghanistan.

I've not heard of a modern society that functions nicely without government, though Rothbard claims in this book that ancient Ireland did. I've never heard of this before, so I'd love to hear people debunk this if it's not true (I haven't had time to sufficiently look it up myself). His claim is that they essentially joined voluntary clans of sorts. They fought, but the death toll was much less than the toll created by European governments at the time. People were free to leave and join other clans. If there were disputes, arbitrators were used. There were even traveling reputable judges that went around settling disputes. Plus, he claims it took England much much longer to conquer them than, say, India, because when you fight a government, you just need to take the capital.

So yes, have a gun, hire a guard, hire a security company to watch your building, or your block, and so on. The book actually goes over this question fairly well, at least better than any online discussions I've seen, and definitely better than I'm about to answer you:

If people stop thinking of the security forces as having any special legitimacy, they'll think of it as any business. And war is bad for business.

Churches (from the Roman Catholic to the Orthodox and even Muslim) like to consider that as part of the community their actions are a force for good. The problem is that the dogma of all these Churches is archaic and mixed in with all the sensible stuff of turning the other cheek, not stealing or killing, are instructions that are no longer applicable to modern society. 



A classic case is the problem faced by the current Pope with regards to condoms. Most sensible people understand that condoms when properly used reduce the spread of AIDS, reduce pregnancies and the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases. A sensible approach is for the Roman Catholic Church to allow the use of condoms since it would reduce the presence of AIDS in the communities where the Church is growing the fastest. For them to allow the use of condoms would help these communities, but the Church can't do it, because condoms are ""intrinsically evil"". 



The piece of dogma causing this problem is that ""life begins at conception"", and to stop a life from being created is described [here](http://www.vatican.va/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm) at point 2370:

&gt;  Periodic continence, that is, the methods of birth regulation based on self-observation and the use of infertile periods, is in conformity with the objective criteria of morality.157 These methods respect the bodies of the spouses, encourage tenderness between them, and favor the education of an authentic freedom. In contrast, ""every action which, whether in anticipation of the conjugal act, or in its accomplishment, or in the development of its natural consequences, proposes, whether as an end or as a means, to render procreation impossible"" is intrinsically evil...

The Pope, whoever he is (and even if he wanted to) will not be able to change that particular piece of teaching. Allowing the use of condoms would reduce the ranks of Roman Catholics. And all Churches understand that religious strength is based on numerical advantage. Europeans largely disregard the nonsensical business of not using condoms, and as a result the Roman Catholic Church (and most Churches in fact) is extremely weak in Europe. Where the Roman Catholic Church is growing is in the developing world; where the lack of contraception, and the lack of education produces many little Roman Catholics who will all produce many more Roman Catholics. The fact that a staggering number of them have AIDS is irrelevant to the Church, which is only really interested in the production of more Catholics. 

The reality is that this Pope is just stating the policy of the Church. To do anything else would reduce the numbers of Roman Catholics in the world, and that would just weaken the Church. ",,t1_c08fqr3,False,,t3_872x3,0,2,c08fqr3,news,0,True,2,0,t3_872x3,rambunctious,1237937250,False

t5_2cneq,,1425943028,"OBAMA: And there is uniform acknowledgment that the procurement system right now doesn’t work. That’s not just my opinion. That’s John McCain’s opinion. That’s Carl Levin’s opinion.

There are a whole host of people who are students of the procurement process that will say, if you’ve got a whole range of billion-dollar, multibillion-dollar systems that are, where we’re seeing cost overruns of 30 percent or 40 percent or 50 percent, and then still don’t perform the way they’re supposed to or are providing our troops with the kinds of tools that they need to succeed on their missions, then we’ve got a problem.

Now, I think everybody in this town knows that the politics of changing procurement is tough, because, you know, lobbyists are very active in this area. You know, contractors are very good at dispersing the jobs and plants in the Defense Department widely.

And so what we have to do is to go through this process very carefully, be more disciplined than we’ve been in the last several years.

As I’ve said, we’ve already identified potentially $40 billion in savings just by some of the procurement reforms that are pretty apparent to a lot — a lot of critics out there. And we are going to continue to find savings in a way that allows us to put the resources where they’re needed, but to make sure that we’re not simply fattening defense contractors.

One last point. In order for us to get a handle on these costs, it’s also important that we are honest in what these costs are. And that’s why it was so important for us to acknowledge the true costs of the Iraq war and the Afghan war, because if — if those costs are somehow off the books and we’re not thinking about them, then it’s hard for us to make some of the tough choices that need to be made.

OK, Ed Henry. Where’s Ed? There he is.

Q: Thank you. Mr. President. You spoke again at the top about your anger about AIG. You’ve been saying that for days now. But why is it that it seems Andrew Cuomo seems to be in New York getting more actual action on it?

And when you and Secretary Geithner first learned about this 10 days, two weeks ago, you didn’t go public immediately with that outrage. You waited a few days. And then when — you went public after you realized Secretary Geithner really had no legal avenue to stop it.

And, more broadly, I just want to follow up on Chip and Jake. You’ve been very critical of President Bush doubling the national debt. And, to be fair, it’s not just Republicans hitting you. Democrat Kent Conrad, as you know, said, quote, When I look at this budget, I see the debt doubling again.

You keep saying that you’ve inherited a big fiscal mess. Do you worry, though, that your daughters, not to mention the next president, will be inheriting an even bigger fiscal mess if the spending goes out of control?

OBAMA: Of course I do, Ed, which is why we’re doing everything we can to reduce that deficit.

Look, if this were easy, then, you know, we would have already had it done, and the budget would have been voted on, and everybody could go home. This is hard.

And the reason it’s hard is because we’ve accumulated a structural deficit that’s going to take a long time, and we’re not going to be able to do it next year or the year after or three years from now. What we have to do is bend the curve on these deficit projections.

And the best way for us to do that is to reduce health care costs. That’s not just my opinion. That’s the opinion of almost every single person who has looked at our long-term fiscal situation.
Now, how do we — how are we going to reduce health care costs? Because the problem is not just in government-run programs. The problem is in the private sector, as well. It’s experienced by families. It’s experienced by businesses.

And so what we’ve said is, look, let’s invest in health information technologies. Let’s invest in preventive care. Let’s invest in mechanisms that look at who’s doing a better job controlling costs while producing good quality outcomes in various states and let’s reimburse on the basis of improved quality, as opposed to simply how many procedures you’re doing. Let’s do a whole host of things, some of which cost money on the front end, but offer the prospect of reducing costs on the back end.

Now, the alternative is to stand pat and to simply say, we are just going to not invest in health care. We’re not going to take on energy. We’ll wait until the next time that gas gets to $4 a gallon. We will not improve our schools. And we’ll allow China or India or other countries to lap our young people in terms of their performance. We will settle on lower growth rates, and we will continue to contract, both as an economy and our ability to — to provide a better life for our kids.

That, I don’t think, is the better option. Now, am I completely satisfied with all the work that needs to be done on deficits? No. That’s why I convened a fiscal responsibility summit — that started in this room — to start looking at entitlements and to start looking at the big drivers of costs over the long term.
Not all of those are reflected in our budget, partly because the savings we anticipate would be coming in years outside of the ten-year budget cycle that we’re talking about.

OK?

Q: But on AIG, why did you wait — why did you wait days to come out and express that outrage? It seems like the action is coming out of New York and the attorney general’s office. It took you days to come public with Secretary Geithner and say, look, we’re outraged. Why did it take so long?

OBAMA: It took us a couple of days because I like to know what I’m talking about before I speak.

All right.

Major?

Q: Good evening, Mr. President. Thank you.

t5_2qh2p,,1425943103,"&gt;The biggest problem with atheism is that it’s a philosophy which, at its very core, diminishes the value of life. If we were simply spawned from a puddle of gook, human life has no intrinsic value.

This is actually where anti-atheist arguments get a lot more compelling, IMHO.  I don't think that the argument for the existence of Yahweh has much of a serious chance in a debate, but the argument that *believing* in Yahweh, even if it's wrong, might be a beneficial thing is a whole different ballgame.  Dawkins kind of just asserts that religion is bad from a pragmatic standpoint, throws out a couple examples, and acts as if he's somehow proved something.  Maybe the net effect is a positive.  No great way of knowing.  Christianity certainly tapped into tribalism a long time back and was used to help unite Europe and the North and the South of the United States after the Civil War.  Since we don't have a world equivalent to ours but without religion to compare to, we don't know whether or not (falsely) believing in religion might be beneficial.

Now, on the face of it, this argument doesn't help at all.  After all...why would being made by Yahweh ""add meaning"" to your existence?  Maybe Yahweh wants you to do something with your existence...okay, sure.  But lots of people want me to do something now, and that apparently isn't sufficient for his existence to have meaning.  Is it because the belief includes the idea that Yahweh created me?  Would life that we genetically engineer or an AI that I create have meaning only if I existed and created it with a specific desire as to its behavior, but not have meaning if it simply arose out of chance?

Well, it might give some purpose to *life* -- after all, there's an afterlife hanging in the balance.  If you subscribe to a denomination of Christianity where good works and not just belief matter, this changes how you might act in life.  If you're about to die, why not, oh, go out and settle old debts?  Blow someone's head off?  Sure, it does resolve that, because then maybe you wind up in hell.

But then, what meaning does your existence in *heaven* have?  If people in society are religious and *correct* in their belief, the problem isn't resolved.

But, okay, how about this.  We say that Yahweh doesn't exist, Christianity is a load of nonsense, but that *falsely believing* makes you *act* as if it does.  Maybe it means that you've a reason for not going over and settling those old debts before dying...and what happens afterwards doesn't *actually* matter, because your belief is false.  If you are intentionally trying to get people to falsely believe in Christianity, *then* it might make sense to advocate belief as giving meaning to life.

That's got some meat to it.

Sure, but unlike the *existence of a god*, this is an opinion.  It's a lot harder to support, and I can rattle of a number of examples where people feel that religion *does* wind up being helpful.

&gt;I also hold the opinion that the ends do not justify the means in terms of believing false doctrine.

What does it mean to ""not justify the means""?  You mean you don't want to do it?  All right, but what if it means, oh, that we avoid one big nasty European war and there aren't any pragmatic drawbacks that outweigh the benefits?

Truth is good because it usually makes things better, but I can clearly provide examples where knowing the truth probably *isn't* better from someone's standpoint (at least down the line).  For example, maybe someone is extremely distraught and has a gun and is about to shoot themselves.  They think that their husband was killed in an auto accident.  You straighten them out -- their husband actually killed their kids in a murder-suicide in an auto.  They kill themselves.  If they'd found out later on, they wouldn't have lost control, and would have been glad that they didn't kill themselves.

I think that being honest is, *as a rule of thumb*, a better idea, but it's not hard to come up with at least manufactured scenarios where it clearly isn't, at least as most of us would measure things.

&gt;How much money is spent building those churches that serve no purpose except to spread religion? How much money is spent on religious universities that train their students to convert people to their religion? What happens when all these people who have dedicated their lives to this false doctrine? It's possible they became ""nicer"" people in the process, but is it worth it?

Beats me, but I don't have to prove that.  All I'm saying is that it's not clearly the case that it *isn't* worth it.

&gt;My problem with the quote you brought up is that it confuses evolution (a scientific theory) with religious beliefs about the meaning of life. That humans evolved from single-celled organisms has no bearing on the meaning of life.

It's sloppy, but I believe that what the author meant was that ""there is no god"".  A sheer accident of insane luck that resulted in us springing fully formed without evolution involved world have the same effect.  It's not that religion or even Christianity is incompatible with evolution; it's that evolution answers a question that was formerly (in its unanswered state) used to argue for Christianity -- ""if no God, where did we come from?""

σοφία (genitive σοφίας) f, first declension; (sophiā)

   1. skill or cleverness in carpentry, music, or other crafts
   2. skill related to everyday life: sound judgment, prudence
   3. knowledge of a higher kind: learning, wisdom

Wisdom, for me, has a quite different sense than knowledge.  Skill, or *know-how*, also seems quite different than knowledge (at least in the sense you seem to have in mind).

The oracle said Socrates was the wisest in the land.  Socrates sought those wiser than he.  He found that his wisdom consisted in knowing that he did not know.  At the very least, wisdom is tied to second-order knowledge, or knowledge about knowledge,  rather than mere acquisition of facts.

Nietzsche, who was a philologist, suggested that the roots of σοφία drew from the sense of *taste* (whereas the etymon of ""wisdom"" is thought to be a Proto-Indo-European term meaning ""to see"").

Alain Badiou conceives of the task of philosophy as establishing truth procedures, which are necessarily opposed to (or, better to say, ""ulterior to"") both *knowledge* and *law*.

Many philosopher's have worked to overcome the conceit of knowledge.  Whether, like Descartes, they did so in hopes of finding a certain foundation, or, like Hume, in order to offer human being an instruction in humility, they furthered our liberation from the tyranny of knowledge nonetheless.

---------------------
What is this supposed to mean?
&gt;If you wish to dabble in words you need to know what they mean. Philosophy is closely tied to linguistics. Do you know what I am saying?... Not many philosophers after the renaissance would say you do.

Why would any philosophers after the Renaissance say anything about me at all?

------------------

From Heraclitus to Badiou there is a long running tradition of philosophizing in opposition to the law.  I believe it was Kant who forged the closest ties between philosophy and legalism.

-----------------------

Here, I think you may confuse philosophy with sophistry:
&gt;If you're good at philosophy you'll be good at the law but only because you'll have learned all these tricks which are convincing.

t5_2qh63,,1425943541,"&gt;We are libertarians; you can't blame us for the things the republicans did.

Only to an extent. There are an awful lot of Republican talking points being spouted off here. Too many for it to be coincidence. There are definitely some Michelle Malkin fans in the room.

&gt;I voted for Bob Barr this year, not Obama or McCain.

Bob Barr was so bad that even Ron Paul refused to endorse him. RP's recommendation was Chuck Baldwin.

Bob Barr was [a huge supporter of the war on drugs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Barr#War_on_drugs) for well over a decade. The ban of medical marijuana is actually called the ""Barr"" bill. Bob Barr also authored DOMA, a deeply damaged piece of legislation if I've ever seen one.

Now Barr ""regrets all that"" and the Libertarian party immediately prop him up as leader. Pretty sad stuff.

&gt;Well, if you think AIG is ""too big to fail"" then you are obviously not pro-economic growth.

Incorrect. If someone thinks AIG was ""too big to fail"" it means that they are not down for a full-on systemic collapse of the financial industry.

&gt;When you say ""too big to fail"" you don't realize that there are other companies waiting to purchase any of AIG's assets that are profitable, and for the ones that aren't, why would we want them anyway?

These are good points, but it goes back to systemic collapse. *Every* major bank was insolvent shortly after the Lehman collapse. AIG was the insurer of all of them.  Without AIG even more major banks would have failed, and I'm not sure who would have bought the assets if they had all went under.

&gt;Look what happened when WaMu collapsed? Did the economy implode? I believe WaMu was the United States largest bank before it died and its profitable assets were bought by JP Morgan Chase.

Yes, the economy did implode to an extent. Look around you. What do you think would have happened if JP Morgan Chase, BOA and Wells Fargo had gone under as well? They were nearly as insolvent as WaMu was.

&gt;AIG just posted the biggest loss in world history, by the way. It's stock is trading around 80 cents a share, down from almost $100 in 2000. I think it's safe to say it's already failed.

True. AIG definitely did fail, the government just bought the majority share to keep a few banks barely afloat. Now the few banks that remain at least have some chance of recovery. That's not a bad thing.

&gt;And yes, raising taxes on the rich does make you a socialist in my eyes. For what other reason would you tax the rich more other than that you adhere to the philosophy that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?

Now this is really a core disagreement, and it's not something that we would be likely to agree on if you don't have much life experience (no offense.)

Raising taxes on rich people is not ""punishing"" them. That's not how it works.

That entire idea (and the use of the word socialism) is a Republican strawman argument.

If you think about the workforce at large there are only two non-productive groups. There are poor people who refuse to work, and the idle rich who also refuse to work. Very few of the Billionaires in this country are ""self made,"" hard working types, most simply inherited their wealth.

Take a moment and [read about the social inequity](http://www.wsws.org/articles/2007/nov2007/chin-n14.shtml) in China to see what sort of society pure free marketism brings.

If you have a Billion dollars in China or here in the US you can perpetuate your wealth indefinitely. It's a nepotistic empire, not a healthy economy. Taxing those empires at a higher rate is far from socialism, in fact, it's the *only* way to have a thriving middle class. The rich are already rich, they don't need more advocacy. The middle class do. They rich can already buy influence. The middle class can't.

If you don't tax the large corporations and the uber-rich you don't end up with some sort of libertarian ideal like the people here seem to think. You end up with corporatism and fascism. The middle class shrinks, the lower class expands, money if funneled to the rich through gotcha capitalism. The court systems become bought and paid for.

What exactly makes you think that a Billionaire would respect your property rights? Or that you could afford real property if the upper class didn't want you to? Once the richest families in a country gain too much political influence they can simply pass laws that allow them to funnel more and more wealth up to them recursively.

The Bush administration was notorious for supporting that. See [here](http://www.amazon.com/Free-Lunch-Wealthiest-Themselves-Government/dp/1591841917) and [here](http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/01182008/watch.html).

The millionaires and billionaires are fine. Seriously. Not only do they not need your advocacy, they are actively ripping you off in ways you can't even conceive of, and then playing victim.

Unfortunately, that doesn't keep naive Libertarians and Republicans from puppeting talking points about Obama being a socialist (for supporting a strong middle class) and ""hurting the rich who succeeded"". These people have no concept of how easy life already is for the rich people they are advocating on the behalf of.

To bring that point home, let me say this. I personally was born into a million dollar home. My college was paid for, $30k / year, as was my private school education leading up to it.

My parents recently bought me an Acura TL type S outright to celebrate my new job. That $30k meant nothing to them. Unlike most of the upper class, we're poor enough that I actually need to have a job.  A more typical story would be if I just worked for the family business.

I didn't do anything, zero, zip, to earn this sort of lifestyle except be born into it (and it's a nice lifestyle, trust me -- you don't even know how much ass you can get and how much you can get away simply by having fifty thousand dollars or so in the bank. Do you take random trips to Europe often? Girls *love* it.)

We aren't even that rich. Still, you are stupid, I mean really, really stupid not to tax me more than you do. And I'm a far cry from the empires with Billions of dollars to throw around.

When unemployment is low, workers can demand, and receive, benefits such as salary, bonuses, health care, vacation, better working conditions, etc. Yes, typical U.S. vacation days are much lower than those of European workers, but this is a part of our work culture, right or wrong; surveys have shown large numbers of American workers feel guilty taking vacation (e.g., http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS130132+15-Apr-2008+PRN20080415). 

But if higher wages, vacation, etc. are imposed by edict, higher unemployment results. Again, France is a perfect example of this. Not surprisingly, they had to impose more regulation to fix the problems created by earlier regulation. The imposed 35-hour work week is harmful to both employers and employees. If it works, by causing employers to higher more workers, employers suffer high costs and workers suffer both lower wages (because of the employer has less money available for wages) and less total pay, because the number of hours worked is reduced. If the policy doesn't work—that is, if employers do not hire more workers, and statistics show that they do not—then employees suffer because their hourly output quotas are increased. In a free society, workers would be free to work fewer hours if they choose, but in this case, the government made that choice for them.

t5_2fwo,,1425943732,"I disagree with you very strongly: The more niches there are, the more different ideas and experiments thrive.  If they were truly disconnected from each other, that wouldn't matter as much, because each one would be relatively impoverished.  But as long as there's a weak network of connection among many niches, the overall result is far far stronger than a monoculture.

European languages are actually a good example of this: There's English, but for most people it's not a first language.  Each first-language community is a linguistic niche that can develop separate customs and traditions (linguistically, but also in other ways).  It's useful to have English *as a second language* to provide that weaker connecting network.  But what this simulation models is analogous to dumping their first languages and having them all start with English.

Language is also a bad metaphor, because it has various other characteristics, so I wouldn't take that analogy too far, but we could talk about books: If there are more niches, the overall richness of the world of books increases, as the system supports more writers with different outlooks.  Through the weak connecting network, we can harvest that field for ideals and combine them, in ways that would've been much much less likely if we had a book monoculture.

Connections between niches are very powerful things, but they derive much of their power from the very fact that there are niches in the first place.  If there weren't, these connections wouldn't make much difference.",,t1_c08gloc,False,,t1_c08fxfh,0,1,c08gloc,programming,0,True,1,0,t3_870lo,cos,1238024590,False

In 1991, Ontario was looking for ways to ease the burdens of a backlogged court system. So the province changed its Arbitration Act to allow ""faith-based arbitration"" – a system where Muslims, Jews, Catholics and members of other faiths could use the guiding principles of their religions to settle family disputes such as divorce, custody and inheritances outside the court system.

The big parties are going to court that mass of voters, guaranteed, because they know they can be had.  In the US, a red state flipping to blue (or the reverse) is usually unheard of.  Obama's success was truly a generational event, so they are more crystalized along party lines.

We've got a long way to go before we get that stultified.  We came within a GG's vote for a coalition in both 2004 and 2008, so we're a lot closer to Europe than the US.
