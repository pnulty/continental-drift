[That didn't happen](http://www.snopes.com/history/govern/denmark.asp) and secondly I'd posit that if it *did* happen the Nazis would've simply wiped out the danes as well. They sure showed no qualms about genoicde when it came to non-germanic ethnicities. 

That's the problem with promoting pacifism (which you do, and i'm not sure the Danes do)... if the enemy doesn't give in then you die. Pacificist movements only work in the face of an idealistic enemy by showing them how they fail to measure up to their self-image. Seeing black children firehosed and attacked by dogs shocked white America into persuing integration because America thought it stood for equality and only *then* really learned that seperate was *not* equal. Ghandis movement shocked the British because they thought Imperialism was for the good of the natives, and the self-analysis provoked showed they were wrong. 

The Nazis on the other hand beleived in racial superiority. There is no external pacificst movement that could convince them they were wrong. If this is hard to wrap your mind around, consider how well black pacifists would have done in a nation where equality was not the ideal, and the KKK was the single ruling party.",1425930972,

English is a mixture of both, which is why it's easy to speak a bit of it if you know any European language, but tough to master because of all the inconsistencies.

Take, for example, verb forms. In English we have both weak verms (indicate the preterit by a suffix: 'I smoke' / 'I smok**ed**') and strong verbs (preterite is indicated by a specific vowel change: 'I drink' / 'I dr**a**nk').

In French, there's no such thing as a ""strong"" verb (a germanic concept), so when you learn English in a French school, every verb is either ""regular"" (weak) or ""irregular"" (either weak or truly irregular like 'to be').

So they get pages of ""irregular verbs"" to learn off by heart when most of them are in fact regular, just not under any grammar rules they know. Learning lists of words like that sucks; most students lose interest and only remember a select few, what they really remember is that ""English has tons of irregular verbs"" which is complete bollocks.

Even in ancient times, before paper money made modern hyperinflation levels possible, governments (including Rome) called coinage in to recast it with more base metal, diluting the value, eventually to the point where other nations would not take the money in trade:

&gt;""I want to stress just how fast this all happened. By the time Serverus was crowned in 193 AD, the denarius was still the international currency, even though for the last few generations it had gradually been devalued. But a mere 22 years later, in 215 AD, India first rejected the denarius and then the devalued gold coins. 

&gt;""And of course the world moved much slower in those days, with trade between Rome , India and China taking months. Seen in this light, 22 years was very fast indeed. 

&gt;""After 215 AD and the final loss of Rome 's position as the owner of the world's currency, Rome 's trade, economy and living standards went into tailspins. The ""silver"" denarius lost so much more of its value that even Roman's [sic] wouldn't take it. Emperor Caracalla introduced a new silver coin, the antoninianus, but immediately started to remove silver from it. Within 45 years, by 268, this coin was nothing but base metal with a thin silver coating. 

&gt;""I must stress again how quickly and completely Roman living standards fell from the time that the rest of the [world] rejected its money as the world's currency."" ~ A Short History of International Currencies by Christopher Weber, April 4, 2005 |

Well, I just disagree. I think it's possible to get rich without acting immorally.

&gt;There have been several SEC investigations of him.

Innocent until proven guilty.

&gt;Do they get it wrong sometimes? Sure.

It's not that they get it wrong, it's that they lie. They tell subtle lies, often of ommision, often of emphasis.

&gt;90% of political news you read in other sources is derivative of these papers. 

This is why I called them ""the capstone of the propaganda machine"". The NYT sets the media propaganda agenda for the country.

I read politifact and economist because these are two sources, out of many, that don't follow the lead of the NYT.

The editorial content is not the issue, the News is the issue. NYT news is pushing an agenda - since you are indoctrinated into that particular culture, you don't see it. The fish does not know what water is.

Democrats always call me a Republican, and Republicans always call me a Democrat. This is because each are trapped in two-party thinking. I'm a libertarian. 

&gt;Gee, the rich, white, military industrial complex dominates US society. Really?

It's actually called the military-industrial-media complex, because without the media (aka ""the propaganda wing"") the other parts would be destroyed by the public.

I'm going to initiate you into the true picture behind Western, first world politics:

In Europe, North America, and Australia, you have two major factions at work. One is best called the Rockefellers. The other is best called the Rothschilds. Why do we call them this? Because each faction is basically linked together by the people who fund the think tanks and news papers that push the agenda of that faction.

The Rothschild faction dominates Europe and Canada. Utterly dominates - the Rothschild philosophy can be seen as active in these countries and as the driving force - it is essentially the typical liberal view of reality. Pro-gay, sexual liberation, feminist, pro-abortion, soft-power, etc. This culture is obviously where both of us come from. Democrats.

The Rockefeller faction is mainly an American and Japanese faction, though they do have their agents in other parts of the world. The Rockefellers could also be called the Neocons - these people dominate the Republican party and fund think tanks like the CFR.

Why are they divided into two groups?

Each group has been around for several generations, and they are separate because they have different views for the world. The two world visions are best described by Brave New World and 1984.

The Rockefellers want 1984 - they want Oceania to always be at war with Eurasia, and so on. Their vision for the world is basically a police state based on fear of an outside power. Hence, the Rockefellers love to push ideas like the War on Terror, War on Communism, and since they are based in the US, they have developed an uncanny ability to rope in a religious angle to these views and get the US religious people on board, since USA is a uniquely religiously fervent country. Rockefeller's money-hoard is what really got this faction off the ground. The Nazis were Rockefellers, by the way, which is why the Bush family was always buddy-buddy with the Nazis.

The Rothschilds want Brave New World. They want a more peaceful society based on various opiates that keep people in control. They want conformity and social classes that people basically submit to without a fight. They believe in psychiatry as a force for world peace, hence they are the primary benefactors of the psychological profession. They believe in welfare and universal healthcare and other kinds of gentle bigotry of low expectations sort of policies - soft-power, remember. They believe in indoctrination as the most important goal - their #1 goal is to get kids in school as early as possible, keep them in school as long as possible, and once they leave school, to keep them plugged into some form of constant indoctrination. The Rothschilds' funding, naturally, comes from Nathan Rothschild's fortune, another great philanthropist.

Both sides are tyrannical. Both are basically the union between old-money families and current day thinkers and ideologues who are drafted for having skills and opinions that fit into the particular agenda. Anyone with agendas that don't fit in just don't get funding. Those with agendas who fit into either the Rockefeller or Rothschild vision for the world, will get funding. This is what fuels politics, media, and academia.

Some papers like Drudgereport are Rockefeller shills. Some papers like NYT are dyed-in-the-wool Rothschilds.

In my opinion the Rothschild vision for the world is less evil, however I see both as essentially evil. Both are tyrannical. Some might disagree. Hillary was the Rothschild pick for President - she lost to their chagrin. Obama is, of course, in their camp as well, but not as thoroughly.

McCain and Bush are obviously long time Rockefeller people. 

Follow the money and you'll find the truth. Is GEICO an asshole company? Yes. But they're an insurance company. Insurance companies are assholes by definition. They have to be to stay in business. Is Buffet evil? I think ""evil"" is going too far. I have only seen him do good things - including when he has pissed people off by shutting down factories and stuff. Unprofitable businesses SHOULD be shut down in my opinion, that is the ethical thing to do. Most criticisms of Buffet are based on the fact that he lays people off, but to me this is not a legitimate criticism. If he was personally involved in telling GEICO to fuck people harder than most insurance companies fuck people, well, that would reflect badly on him. But still, he's done a lot of good things, that I've listed earlier.",1425931130,

THAT is what happened to the Spanish, they'd spent soooo much money fighting in France/Netherlands/England etc that gold throughout Europe was depleting in supply as it was being given to private banking interests who largely kept it out of circulation. Then they discover Americas and they can fund wars again.

You get an increase to the money supply when you sell goods to foreigners and they pay you in gold, but then there's a contraction to the supply within the country (as anyone who lives in Australia knows our crayfish are still expensive because the Japanese are willing to pay so much more, so our supply is reduced - scarcity increased - despite how much gets pulled from the ocean) so prices don't move quite widely.",1425931145,

In the US, we claim to be tolerant, but in high schools, anyone with immigrant parents or who is an immigrant is made fun of. Kids stop making fun of kids when they seem to act and more importantly, speak just like them. Accent is a huge thing in the US because it screams ""outsider"" and if you don't speak according to what the local accent is, people will mock you, if not directly, indirectly.

Assimilation is ingrained in society and if you don't assimilate you are an outsider. Europeans who immigrated to the US several decades or a century or two ago made a conscious effort to assimilate and they made sure that their kids learnt English as their first language. However, this no longer holds in certain cultures (Hispanic). Are Hispanic gangs in most major cities as much a result of the alienation kids feel and the ties they have to Mexico/South America, than poverty itself? What about black gangs. Blacks have lived in the US for years, but only blacks with jobs feel assimilated in mainstream culture. You don't see blacks with jobs in gangs. 

Okay, this is not a popular opinion, but are Muslim gangs less active in the US because a lot of Americans dislike Muslims and assimilation helps your chances in society, therefore Muslims find America harder to live in.

I don't really care too much to talk about democracy usually because it's just a powerful buzz word. We used to be a Constitutional Republic as defined in the Constitution, before it was almost entirely suspended under the Patriot Act and other legislation. 

Okay, so right off the bat, most of the history of the U.S. is clearly undemocratic.
Were we a 'democracy' when women and blacks couldn't vote? Was it 'democratic' to have slaves in the U.S.? And then after the right to vote was given to blacks, you have decades of Jim Crow Laws made with the intention of inhibiting blacks from voting. 'Democratic' that is not.

There are further tenets of 'democracy' that the U.S. does not follow. But it doesn't matter, does it? Could you ever accept how bad things are right now. Fear will keep your false hope from allowing you to see the obvious.

A central tenet of 'democracy' is the allowance of the freedom to vote and having that vote count. I suspect your head is in the sand once again concerning the voting fraud of the 2000 election in Florida and the voting fraud of the 2004 election in both Florida and Ohio. Oh, and you can read all about that in books, it's not a web conspiracy, it's been well documented in Europe, where there are still small remnants of free press. But once again, it would probably hurt your brain to research and think about this stuff.

You're trying to portray me as some web conspiracy theorist. First of all, you can find legitimate info on the web. Secondly, I finish a book every 5-7 days. I read read history constantly and am almost done with my political science degree. Sad, I should be reading right now instead of trying to communicate with some dumb fuck on reddit.

Didn't say I was superior in every comment. But I am superior to you, nothing to brag about, just something that's obvious.

So you are dead wrong, and this should put this pointless argument to rest. Democracy is a farce ideal to begin with, but to argue that you live in a democracy now is hilarious. You truly are sucking the Federal Government's cock with such mindless allegiance to the 'democratic' hoax.

Certain parts of the southwestern US have always had water availability problems and most likely always will.  This has little to do with our population being too large and more to do with our wasteful use of natural resources in a region where they are scarce to begin with.

In general, the US uses a much larger chunk of the world's natural resources in proportion to its population than other nations do.  We're basically pretty wasteful in general.  It's true that we can't continue to live the way we do if our population continues to increase (or even stays constant, frankly) but the problem here is the way we use resources, not the size of our population.

Before you use the words ""successful"" and ""European Model"" in the same sentence, be advised that Europe is in more trouble than North America.

Socialism is not welfare, social security, unemployment public benefits, or ""infrastructure"" spending.

Socialism is a politico-economic system characterized by government ownership of the means of production.

Capitalism is a politico-economic system characterized by private ownership of the means of production.

Since Europe has both private ownership and government ownership, one cannot call Europe socialist or capitalist.  It is a mixed economy, like the US, Canada, Mexico, and Asia.

Venezuela is a country that is characterized by government ownership of the means of production for many industries.  Much more so than most other mixed economies.  Chavez is a socialist President, who has taken it upon himself to control the means of rice production, by sending his troops to the rice companies and coercing them into producing at levels Chavez wants.

This is what happens in real socialist countries as a matter of course.  It isn't a question of ""good"" socialist governments and ""bad"" socialist governments.  It is a question of who controls the means of production.

A fully socialist country would entail businesses being threatened like this all the time, because the self-interest of producers will always differ from the self-interest of the government officials.  Since the government officials have the guns, they ultimately end up having their self-interested wants realized, and the producers do not.

Please stop calling Europe socialist.  It is not socialist.  Socialism is a system where the government has full ownership or control over all the means of production.  Europe still has private ownership of the means of production in most industries, therefore it is not socialist.",1425931405,

AFAIK Ireland did it first, and other (EU) countries have followed. Plastic bags used to be a major source of littering in Ireland. Like in the US, they used to be free with every purchase. The law that was then passed kept them legal, but made it uneconomical to give them away by requiring retailers to pay something in the area of 5 or ten cents (I don't recall the actual amount) per each plastic bag given to consumers. As expected, this caused retailers to charge consumers 10 ct per plastic bag, which in the minds of the general population made plastic bags less ""disposable"" and decreased littering. There also were many other positive knock-on effects, e.g. retailers made stronger, reusable plastic bags and people started reusing them, and more people started buying and using more durable reusable shopping bags, e.g. jute/burlap bags or ones made from cloth, and retailers started offering them. Some retailers offer free paper bags that are biodegradable (and those aren't taxed). Also, whereas before the plastic bag tax you'd be given a plastic bag automatically at the grocer's, whether you wanted one or not, staff now ask you. And yes, I personally observed a noticeable difference in terms of littering.

Also see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_bag#Types

PS: The law was very targeted and specific, btw. For instance those very flimsy small transparent plastic bags that are pretty much a hygienic necessity when buying certain fresh vegetables or non-prepacked cheese -- those are not taxed.

As for the more successful ones like Holland, Denmark and Germany; mobility is somewhat better and you can make a decent living but there's still plenty of red tape and the amount of taxes are absolutely demoralizing.

I take it that you don't understand how much an MRI machine costs. My school is putting in a new MRI machine, a really fancy new 7T machine mostly for research. It has to be housed in its own building, isolated from road vibration on massive springs. The EM shielding consists of a single room with 400 tons of lead. The superconductor has to be chilled with a ridiculous amount of liquid helium - a full magnet quench would take over 30 min; 5 min after an ""emergency"" quench, the magnet would still be over 3T. The 7T is expected to double our current 3T resolution, which on an MPRAGE scan would reach 512x512x256.

&gt;It is interesting to note that anti-Zionism, like all classic bigotries, knows no class or caste, and occurs across the entire spectrum of political action. The Nazis were anti-Semitic, the Stalinists were and are still anti-Semitic, and the Arab Nationalists have always been anti-Semitic. That anti-Semitism reaches its fullest modern expression in anti-Zionism.
That anti-Zionism is a destructive poison which the sympathizers and collaborators of Arab Nationalist Movement on both the left and right, in America, in Europe, and in the third world, have infected the political discourse.

This person just blew my mind.  As a Jew that opposes the colonialist nation of Israel I had not realized that I was in fact a racist!

Also, I enjoyed how she (I assume, given the background) censored all the critical comments - but this one got through:

&gt;""Anarcho-zionism"" should be grouped with other marginal attempts by other racists to create ""anarchism for Whites only."" 

&gt;Zionism was a bitter foe of the revolutionary internationalist working class movement to which Sam Dolgoff participated in. Zionism advocates special rights and privilidges for Jews and reduces gentiles, Palestinians, and other ethnic and religious minorities to second or third class citizenship. 

&gt;Anarchism is completely incompatible with colonial, racist ideologies such as Zionism. 

&gt;There is a strand of libertarian socialism in Israel's history that has been completely eradicated and overtaken by the dynamics of ethnic cleansing, capitalism, and authoritarian socialism. The kibbutzim, with rare exception, have become degenerated worker's coops much as most liberal food coops have in the US. The marginal socialist institutions that still survive in Israel can't be described as ""anarchist"" by any stretch.

I'm from Ireland. There's a 50:50 mix of public and private health care. Everyone gets free accident and emergency treatment from the public sector regardless. The private sector doesn't do accident and emergency.
Apart from accident and emergency,the public sector is pretty lousy. There are long waits for operations and it can be dificult to see a specialist. However, if your sick enough you'll be seen quickly enough and treated for free. Also, regardless of when you are treated, the service is top notch! The problem is not poor quality, it's poor management from the government. 

I've lived in Spain too. It's incredible. The public sector is wonderful and free! Every decent sized town, or area of a big city has a health clinic. You walk in, state your ailment, take a ticket and one of many doctors awaits you. Accident and emergency is superb too. In January my friend tore ligaments running down a hill. We went to the central hospital in Malaga, a big enough city. He was greeted, put in a wheel chair, x-rayed, seen by doctor, bandanged and out the door within 70 minutes. All 100% free. 

Although social security taxes in Spain are high, the service and knowledge that you'll be seen by a doctor quickly, and for free is worth it.

So, yeah, free universal healthcare is good. Not knowing you face astronomical charges upon leaving the hospital is definitely reassuring.

1. It's all mostly shit. Just like any other medium where the requirements for publication are the ability to record words on a page, the vast majority of comic writing, and make no mistake, comics are about writing more than they are about art, is shallow, puerile and aimed straight into the gray, lukewarm heart of the Least Common Denominator.

The vast majority of publishers view their audience as people who have not yet discovered free pornography and John Woo movies. It follows that major publishers put a premium on isn't-this-racy character design and can-you-believe-we're-getting-away-with-it violence.

Moral: mainstream comic books are aimed at people of all ages, aged 14. There are about fifty things in the world of comic books that are whole and complete pieces of writing. Half that with really great art .

2. Comics are a whole, self-contained and complete way of telling a story. This way is through minimal writing and lots of art. The difference between a comic book and every other way of telling a story is as great if not greater (Alan Moore) than the difference between a piece of music and a sculpture.

Every comic after about 1935 is part of a largely invisible language of illustration that is so ubiquitous no one really notices it. I mean think about it, a page divided into nine little rectangles in which little people are drawn, who talk, and whose conversation progresses left to right with a carriage return at the end of a line? Who could fucking make that shit up?

Moral: good comics are the meeting of good writing and good art. Good writing addresses everything (and Moore) that good literature addresses. Good art knows the visual history of comics backwards and forwards and seeks to advance it in proportion to how smart the artist is. Again, this is a rarefied circle, and makes more manageable the stack that's actually worth reading.

_____
With these two principles firmly in mind, these are the people I recommend:

Writers:

Alan Moore:

Alan Moore is the rough equivalent of JD Salinger, David Lynch, Daniel Day-Lewis and Miles Davis. He's a guy who's head and shoulders above everybody else in his field, knows it and moreover doesn't give a shit if you know it too. He's the rarest breed of creative person, someone who knows exactly what they're about and in possession of the voice to express it. He's also on his own goddamn track, and is burning with the fire of not giving you, the audience, what you want.

The works of Alan Moore that serve to introduce him are:

1st, The Watchmen (i.e., this medium's Hamlet, the alpha and omega of influence, taste and literary rigor)

2nd, From Hell, an historical novel that you would have to be a Reese Witherspoon fan club president to confuse with a horror-comic about Jack the Ripper.

3rd, V for Vendetta, a book about the fact that anarchism requires the sacrifice of its truest practitioners.

4th, Swamp Thing, wherein the stupidest comic book character ever is made into a thing worth knowing about, as AM shows off his encyclopedic knowledge of the DC Universe.

5th, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, wherein the most insipid creations of British pop culture from the last two hundred years are made into things "" "" "", as AM shows off his "" "" of adventure stories for young boys.


Frank Miller:

FM is a a man trying to be, simultaneously, a loaded gun, an erect penis, the American flag and a 1950's concept Cadillac. The man is singularly obsessed by everything that contributed to the European idea of what an AMERICAN is: again, some kind of nexus between hot dogs, astro-tits, gigantism is every consumer product Rex Banner, etc. etc.

While not every comic of his revolves around these preoccupations explicitly, they're there as surely as Weezy talking about candy is not really talking about candy.

FM intro works:

1st, Hard Boiled, a collaboration with Geoff Darrow, the only artist whom I will later recommend as the only artist to read irrespective of writer. This is right behind Watchmen as the most influential comic of the modern era (1980-now). I also like this enough that I won't spoil its small plot with details.

2nd, The Dark Knight Returns

3rd, Sin City, if you liked the movie you'll probably like even more of it.


Grant Morrison:

A writer coming from a drug background who infrequently transcends the agonizing cliche of being a creative person that has dropped acid. A man who thinks that until you are as warped and possessed of a rebelliousness-of-questionable-utility as he is, you're still literally a slave and a square.

1st, The Invisibles, a long and winding series of issues that deal with many of the facets of modern life that made the Matrix such a smash hit. No really, the Wachoski's stole most it. 


Robert Crumb:

A literal perverted sex maniac who invented most of what we think of as sixties counter-culture, all the while dressing like a 19teens pharmacist. Probably the closest thing comics has ever produced to the commonly understood meaning of 'great artist' (a miserable little man whose death his collectors anticipate with unseemly relish)

1st, some kind of anthology, his stuff is modeled on sunday funnies and short format cartoons


Assorted specialty graphic novelists (i.e. writer/artists), of which Dan Clowes, Charles Burns, Joe Sacco, Will Eisner, Art Spiegelman and Chris Ware seem to me to be the most consistant. This subset of comics are as numerous as singer/songwriters, with roughly the same signal to noise ratio.

________________________

Artists:

This is a tricky area, because as I mentioned, comics that have shitty writing are not like porn that has shitty writing. The writing and the art are much more closely tied together. That said, there are plenty of examples of artists so good that they're worth seeing in their native habitat of shallow dialogue. These include:

Jack Kirby, Wally Wood, Steve Ditko, Joe Orlando, Jean Giraud (Moebius) and of course

Geoff Darrow, whom I recommend as the only artist to read irrespective of writer.

While the universities might be good, a relatively small percentage of the population actually pursue university studies and the socioeconomic higher strata are over-represented (meaning talent is not what goes to the universities, it is money).


Semi-corrupt, yes. For example, IKEA has been trying for at least 10 years to set up shop in Ireland, but every time they find a suitable location, the local council deny them building permits or put other obstacles in place, because of close ties between politicians and local businessmen, who do not want the competition. As far as I could tell (not a scientific study, of course), my Irish friends told me that is the norm on the local politics level in Ireland. While not outright corruption (as it is usually pals of the same country club or similar talking), it nevertheless means less competition and a less healthy internal market.


As for the retail sector, what I meant was that Ireland had a strong retail sector, but as consumption reclines in the recession, that is no longer a basis for the economy.


'Underdeveloped economic market' I arrived at from personal experience of me and a few dozen other Swedes. Let me give you an example;


The system of deposits. In Sweden, you have a social security number and use that to order things. Yopu are required to register your adress (for taxing purposes). If you do not pay your bills, the companies can turn your debt to the special government agency for debts and they will sieze funds or property (after some process, but anyway). There's no way to move away from debt, it will always be tied to you. So as long as you have no registered such debts, you just sign up for what you need and the bills start arriving. 

The system of deposits lock consumers in. When I arrived in Ireland, I had to pay a deposit for the apartment, a deposit for the cell phone, a deposit for the broadband, a deposit for the gas, a deposit for the electricity. I saw cheaper alternatives a bit into my stay, but the need to get a new deposit before I could get my old one back made me shrug at it. What about people who do not save? They are effectively locked in, and competition and prices suffer as a result. Everything except manual services was way more expensive in Dublin than it was in Östersund or Stockholm. I see that as signs of an underdeveloped market.


You are probably quite right that my view of Dublin as a shitty place to live has coloured my view of the entire country. I think one of the main problems of Ireland is that the infrastructure, culture, bureauocracy and generally people did not change with the great economic progress the last 10-20 years. Not fast enough anyway. There's still a segment of people who did not get any real benefits from the growth and only see that they can only afford a room nowadays, when they used to be able to afford a house, and the pint costs €4 instead of €1, and it is the fucking foreigners and IT people's fault! I never met a more complex attitude - some where open, friendly and nice, others had a very racist attitude. Coolest were all the pensioneers driving cabs, discussing politics and history with them was awesome when going home from the pub.

Perhaps some of Ireland's problems today is because culture and people did not move as fast as the economy. People used to be rich do not take the same risks as poor people suddenly finding themselves making great wads of cash?",1425931650,

In such a system, it's hard to find care, even if you have money. Canadians that need immediate care are forced to travel to other countries (USA) to receive it.

I'm not saying our current system is amazing btw. It's definitely really fucking shitty. Both programs have their benefits and drawbacks.

No, you don't.
Yes, you have a privatized one. Look at how many European countries do (Scandinavia's probably got the best examples here I think); a lot more state-controlled (i.e. more ""socialized"" in your mind?), and we pay less (on each visit). We do (of course) pay higher taxes, which ""hides"" the total cost from you, so if you calculate a total (some percentile of total taxes and one-time-fees) it'll probably end up somewhere up at the same price as for you. The important thing here is that it'll not feel like that huge a cost, and you know that your health-problems will be taken care of. You don't need to check your policy(-ies?) to see if it's covered in some way.

Most European countries do not have all those frivolous lawsuits, you know, suing a doctor for millions for malpractice for the smallest mistake or imperfection, and therefore, doctors do not need to provide lots of unnecessary stuff, which drives the cost down. A LOT.

American healthcare system is like where you can sue your car dealer if you buy a cheap, two-star crash-test car and get hurt in an accident, because the car is less safe than a five-star car. 

The result is: they only sell you five-star crash-test cars -&gt; expensive, and  still not good enough, still without the extras, because that would be even more expensive. 

The real reason why healthcare is cheaper in Europe that if you just need a two-star car, you get one, with extras included, cheaply, because you cannot sue the dealer if it breaks to pieces in an accident. The difference is NOT _who_ pays for the car, but the lawsuits.

Specifically, so much for the prosperity of the ruling minority. This world, which is objectively and unavoidably split into classes, is incapable of providing prosperity and wealth to all. What we see today is prosperity and wealth in the hands of the few, while the many go starving, struggle to maintain living standards and so on. What Socialists and Communists aim to achieve, through the collective power of the whole of the working class, is to bring that prosperity to everyone equally.

*""Who dictates what is a 'need' and what is not?""* Good question. We do. Everyone does. A system based on need requires that needs be heard. More specifically, you cannot fulfill needs if those people who require things are not participating. (Which is in part why Capitalism does not have the motivation or the capacity to provide for everyone's needs.) Democratic organisation of society, organically, through the working class, the laboring class. That is, representative organisational bodies, who represent working class people, without bureacratic seperation. Who can be recalled at any time. In other words, everyone decides together, democratically, what should be produced and where it needs to go, through this rank and file representative organisation.

But to be really, really simple on that question, Karl Marx clarified it best. ""Be it the needs of the stomach, or needs of the mind."" In other words, what you need can be anything from basic subsistance (food, clothing, a house and so on), or things that you want solely for enjoyment (games, computers, televisions, funky furniture etc). The person who decides what you need is you.

*""No competition? So it is all just a bunch of monopolies?""* Not at all. Yes, there is a monopoly of wealth, but not a 'bunch of monopolies.' The monopoly of wealth we have today is a 'bunch of monopolies.' Monopolies which are being more and more concentrated and centralised amongst the bigger capitalists. From Rupert Murdoch to Richard Branson, their monopolies are growing, which means that for everyone else, wealth is decreasing. The monopoly of wealth under a Communist social organisation is in the hands of all, with equal share, equal say and equal rights to that monopoly. Simply put, everyone gets a piece of the cake, because the vast majority, the laboring class, is the one who created it.

""*What if I want to open my own business? Am I allowed?*"" There is no reason to say that you would not be able to open your own shop, providing a service that you enjoy and wish to provide to others. However, there is no basis for exploitation of labor, and therefore, no basis or objective ability to profit. That basically means, you'd do it for leisure, not to amass more wealth than everyone else.

One of the fundamentals of understanding capitalism is understanding the Labor theory of value, which, Marx was not the only theoretician to subscribe to. Many of the early economists agreed with this theory, it was only after the rise of the massive labor movement through Europe which announced ""Socialism!"" that the far right of Capitalism moved to distort and over-complicate how Capitalism actually works.

The Labor theory of Value is basically that Value is only created through the investment of Labor. For example: Capital does not create more capital on its own. Capital requires labor to create new value, new capital. Capitalism works on the basis of exploiting labor power, to create surplus value/profit. Actually here's a link that myself and several other contributors have tempered, in the hopes of simplifying it: http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism

Capitalism requires you to exploit the labor power of working people. Under communism, you would not be able to do so, because you would have no further right over the means of production than anyone else.

*""Who dictates what I can produce, and how much I can sell it for?""* Again, you would dictate what it is that you wish to produce. Of course, in a cooperative society, you would also be able to decide that with your peers, with your fellow human beings if you so chose. You however, would have no ability to sell your product. There is no material basis for you to be able to do so, and since profit is impossible, sale becomes merely production. You would produce for your own leisure, not to amass wealth above others.

Of course, being able to trade your commodities for other commodities (barter) will always exist, usefulness for usefulness, however, much less trade would be required, as there is no reason for anything to have a price.

I think that all of what I just said seems like an elaborate pipe-dream to many people. And that is understandable, given that Capitalism is placed on a pedastal as being, ""The end of history..."" However, if anything, Capitalism has shown that it most certainly isn't. That time and time again, even from the very start of Capitalism, there was resistance to it. The 19th and 20th centuries have been rife with resistance, from the Chartists of the 1840s, to the Labor movement of the late 19th century, to the Socialist movement during the early 20th century (which saw multiple working class revolutions, however, only one succeeded - though only for a brief time - the Russian revolution). The massive revolts of 1968 and so on. The 21st century is no different. With two governments already crumbling under mass public action (Latvia and Iceland), with millions coming out in protest against the attack on Gaza, with the massive public outcry in Greece and so on.

Even in Australia, there has been mass resistance. How do you think the Labor Party was formed?

People show day in and day out that Capitalism is a phase that we are going through. And people are being tempered, and sometimes forced to remember the lessons of the past struggles against it. People show time and time again, when they move into mass revolutionary action they can organise themselves democratically, to oppose the system. In every working class revolution, workers have organised themselves in the way that I had described above. They began to occupy factories and produce for their needs, for the needs of the people around them etc. They began to work consciously as a collective. (As opposed to the unconscios collectivity that people are forced to work in under Capitalism.)

All of what I described is very possible, especially when time and time again the market forces prove their inadequacy, when time and time again, Capitalism fails to provide for all, and time and time again, Capitalism leads itself into crisis.",1425931716,

That's not because it doesn't do nationalized health care.  All services cost more in the United States.  If you fly overseas to, say, any other nation (commonly done for elective surgeries where cost is an issue, like sex change operations), even though you are not a citizen and the national system isn't subsidizing you, you will pay much less for health services than the United States.  There are plenty of reasons -- lower liability costs for doctors, much higher service costs -- a surgeon in the US can make $300,000/year -- but it's clearly not because the service isn't nationalized.

Nowhere does it say European women are responsible for 60% of human trafficking worldwide, so your title contains an untruth. According to the article, the only country specifically mentioned is France, where 30% of convictions were for women, compared to 10% of crime in general. So that leaves men responsible for the remaining 70% of human trafficking in France. The article does state that the figures are higher elsewhere in Europe, but does not back up this claim with any statistics.

It seems logic to me that an industry that mainly ""employs"" women would also be run by women. What I would like to see are numbers about how many of the women convicted were themselves victims of this crime.
Furthermore, the article only mentions convictions and this might not be representative of the actual numbers nor their position in the power structure. There are people that exist that have no regard for another human life, some of those are men and some of those are women. You sound like that face blows your mind or something?

BECAUSE WE'RE NOT FUCKING SOCIALIST! What don't you understand????????????????

I'm sorry, but people DO NOT inherently have a right to health care. A person who gorges themselves until they weigh 500 pounds DOES NOT have a right to health care if they can't pay for it themselves. A person who has drank alcohol until they have liver problems and need to go to the doctor DOES NOT have a right to health care. Irresponsible people should NOT be allowed to go to the doctor on MY dime. Children and the elderly

What needs to happen is a complete overhaul of the health care system that we already have, which includes removing the catering to the pharmaceutical companies and removing drug ads from television. They have no business being there in the first place for the same reason cigarette ads shouldn't be there and the same reason alcohol ads shouldn't be there.  Most people aren't doctors, so if you have to have a prescription to get it, you shouldn't be allowed to ""pre-diagnose"" yourself by watching a fucking commercial. 

Take away the right of a corporation to lobby. Period. Corporations like pharmaceutical companies are not human beings and they don't have rights. That's one of the big parts of the problem with the government in the United States and in any other country. What's there not to understand? Corporations are out to make money, that's what they're supposed to do. Corporations are legally bound to make a profit. They do not have your best interests at heart, only their pocketbook. Since corporations aren't people, they shouldn't be allowed to lobby. Get it? But, this won't ever happen because stupid people like you would rather get as free of a ride as you can get instead of fixing the real problem so it's easier on everyone. 

The only people who have a right to healthcare are the people who take care of themselves or have the ability to pay for it. Our constitution provides for the right to life, liberty, and the PURSUIT of happiness. That doesn't mean you have a RIGHT to happiness. You don't have a right to happiness. You really don't, regardless of what Obama and all the other socialist propaganda-scarfing people here think. The systems overseas are not superior to ours because those people have traded out freedoms in order to be able to have that free health care. 

Another part of the problem is the morality of modern people. People would sooner throw their parents into a nursing home than make room in their homes to take care of them. Every major religion on the planet says for you to take care of your parents! Seeing as atheism is on the rise, the slump in basic morality really doesn't surprise me.

We don't need more government control over our lives. You people (talking to other Reddit viewers here) over in Europe and everywhere else may be happy with it, but we hopped across the pond to get away from tyrants and your idea of ""security"" hundreds of years ago. If you're in the US and you want that system, why don't you hop BACK across the pond you or your ancestors came from and stick it out there? Socialists in the US can go be socialist in a country that's already socialist... like Britain. There are plenty of socialist countries, you keep talking about how great they are, so why don't you go live over there..? Oh, I know... the standard of living is LOWER!  Less room, more crowded... you'll pay 3 times as much for a home in 'Great' Britain or Germany than you will in the United States AND you'll get less square footage! Gas evens out in Britain to what..? $10US a gallon?  It's $2 here and I'm lovin' it.  And you can say what you want to about the greatness of using less gas because things are closer together, but when the riots start over the financial crisis, they're not going to like being so close to ""everything"". Let's see what their standard of living goes to, then.

You can have your overcrowded, camera-surveilled, 'free' healthcare providing socialist countries, and I'll keep my land of the free and home of the brave.

There would be more than enough money for the United States to pay for free health care for all people if Congress would manage their money right instead of adding in so much pork into bills for their little ""private projects"" all the fucking time. Nobody'd have to pay for anything having to do with healthcare out of pocket! It's not so much a problem with our healthcare as it is with a problem with our overall government. You don't take from the rich to give to the poor and you don't take from the poor to give to the rich; meaning, you don't take money out of my pocket to give to someone who takes advantage of the system and you don't take money from a poor person to give it to a fatcat rich fucker that takes advantage of the system, either.

To fix health care, the ENTIRE GOVERNMENT needs to be overhauled. And the answer isn't socialism. People need to get back to a community mindset and take care of EACH OTHER instead of relying on the government to fix the problem... government NEVER fixes problems, they create them. If there were no problems, politicians would be out of a job. Where do you think all these problems we have came from? Politicians trying to FIX things. Less government, more morality, more personal responsibility is what people need, NOT another government program. People used to take care of each other; let's get back to that and leave the government out of it, please. Oh, I'm sorry, we can't do that, because the government won't give back powers they've already taken from us... because people like you have let them. Nevermind.

In general, American healthcare  is of far greater quality than that of Europe or Canada, It's just far more expensive than either. Europeans and Canadians who can afford it will generally opt for American treatment, when available.

Part of the reason for this is that standards are so stringent: people simply are not allowed to purchase healthcare below a certain level of quality. Also, government subsidies drive up prices by guaranteeing that overpriced healthcare will always have a market. More so, rich people have a lot to spend on healthcare and poor people not so much. Buying roughly the same products allows the providers to charge more because the wealthy can afford it and ignore the poor demographic. Since charging different prices to different income brackets is largely illegal, this means that the companies make the most money by providing to the wealthy at higher cost than to everybody at lower cost.

One kind of solution to this problem is the so called 'socialist' single-payer system in which everybody is forced to use the same insurance plan. This reduces demand (in the economic sense of the word,) and lowers price consequentially. It also threatens to lower the quality as hospitals and providers will be forced to do with significantly reduced funding and market competition in the American healthcare market will be greatly reduced.

There is also the solution of reducing standards and subsidies in America and allow providers to offer lesser quality services to people of poorer income brackets. This will create a variety of healthcare services available, allowing people with less money to pay less and receive reduced quality service. This would allow the market to more properly function and would likely be the cheapest solution over all. The poor would to worse in this system than a single payer system, but better than in the current system. The rich would do better than either. The only people to hurt would be the insurance companies and the HMOs.

They're sadly right.  If cabinet minutes don't remain private, cabinet members just won't speak candidly in them - discussions will happen elsewhere; elsewhere somewhere private.  There's no point *forcing* transparency when all that will happen is that the conversation will move venue.  How then can we guarantee that the cabinet members you trust to be in attendance, those of an anti-war disposition such as [Robin Cook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Cook) and [Clare Short](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Short), that they would be involved.  Would doves be invited to the chat over drinks about going to war?

I'm from Denmark and our healthcare, education and welfare systems are by no means perfect, but I wouldn't have it any other way. There's almost equal access to all of it. 

Our current fascists in charge would like to change that, what they neglect to mention is, that our social-democratic governments from the 1930's up have created not only a very equal society, but an extremely competitive economy. Our GDP is currently about 40% higher pr. capita than in the US, crime, child-mortality and poverty is low.

Well sure, if your only qualifier is cheap health care then of course you are going to favor a system that has the lowest costs. But it isn't nearly that cut and dry.

&gt;This includes every European nation, every universal healtcare nation, every frikkin' nation in the world pays less per person, and most of the developed nations provide better care.

Depends on how you define ""better care."" Many of these health rankings place heavy weighting on ""equal access"" (usually only in theory). However countries with government managed health care tend to suffer shortages and the health plans are frequently underfunded. When something like health care is subsidized it effectively creates infinite demand so supply must be rationed. But due to the nature of government, there is no effective way for politicians and bureaucrats to effectively allocate resources and capital or set realistic prices based on economic conditions.

The United States overwhelmingly dominates the field of medical research. What many people don't realize is much of the innovation in medicine would not occur if the United States put price controls on health care and medicine. It's much harder to remain innovative when a government places price controls on the product you just spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing. So what do research companies do? Charge higher prices to Americans. Yes, Americans are subsidizing medical research and pharmaceuticals for the rest of the world.

The research environment in the United States, compared with Europe, is wealthier, more competitive, and more meritocratic. These features lead to more medical discoveries. About 400,000 European researchers are living in the United States, usually for superior financial compensation and research facilities.

http://ostina.org/downloads/pdfs/bridgesvol7_BoehmArticle.pdf

If health care in the US becomes subsidized a lot of that research will disappear.

&gt;The United States is the ONLY developed nation that does not offer universal healthcare.

Appeal to popularity.

&gt;Here's the part that opponents of universal health care don't seem to grasp: privatized health care costs more.

It is easy to criticize the US health care system, but before doing so you need to realize that it is not ""free market"" or ""private"" health care. In the areas of eye surgery, cosmetic surgery, and the few other sectors of health where free market competition is allowed to operate without government meddling, prices are falling and customer service is good.

When government and insurance companies are kept away from the transaction, good new things happen. Competition gives consumers more choices. And choice gives them power.

It came into common use among European explorers, colonists, and traders in Africa, to refer to the region of Western Africa just under the 'bulge' of the continent.  Equatorial Guinea, Guinea, and Guinea-Bissau were all considered part of the general region of 'Guinea.'  When they came under colonial rule, the territory of Guinea was occupied by France and known as French Guinea, the territory of Guinea-Bissau was occupied by Portugal and became Portuguese Guinea, and the territory of Equatorial Guinea belonged to the Spanish and was Spanish Guinea.

Papua New Guinea got its name 1546, when the Spanish explorer Inigo Ortiz de Retes landed there, and thought the aboriginal inhabitants, with their dark skin and curly hair, looked like the Africans of Guinea.

Guyana and French Guiana, however, are not at all related to the Guineas of the world.  Their name comes from an indigenous word for rivers, which the area has a lot of.

The British coin called the guinea was named after the African region, since they were first minted for the purpose of doing trade there.

First of all, in many cases it doesn't even matter if a GM crop cross-pollinates with nearby relatives if the trait is benign. For example, a crop engineered to have higher vitamin A content (like Golden Rice), should that gene get transferred, wouldn't destabilize an ecosystem like the transfer of a gene for pest resistance would.

And second, there are many ways of controlling gene transfer, if it is unwanted. Crops can be made to not reproduce, eliminating the threat of genetic contamination. And before you cry out that this would enslave farmers, forcing them to buy new GM seed every year, keep in mind that *most farmers in Europe and the United States, as well as many commercial farmers elsewhere* already buy new seed every year. Seed-saving is a thing of the past. The reason is that new seed is certified seed, and has higher yield than saved seed. It is also less susceptible to disease. Apple farmers for example, *can't* use saved seed because the seeds they get from the apples they grow can turn into wildly different types of apple trees. Certified seeds enable them to grow the same product each season. Also, there's technology called ""gene-deletion,"" in which we can create genetically modified crops that can have the transgenes “deleted” from the genetic code with the addition of a promoter to the crop. This means that GM corn could be grown, and then all transgenes could be removed from specific parts of the plant, such as the pollen or the edible part. This could eliminate the risk of gene flow and of potential negative health effects of consuming transgenes. [Source](http://gene-deletor.net/GDTT.aspx)

Also, hang out with other people! You're a nice normal girl, and at a high school there's always a huge variety of people. Find a niche there of people who can appreciate you. Find friends who are supportive, and friends that you can laugh with. 

Self acceptance is the biggest thing I can recommend. You aren't going to change the way you look. Your intelligence is what it is, and so is your personality. The good news is that there will always be people that love you for who you are.

The US government never, never, never give money for free or by pure compassion. Individuals may. But never does the US government. 

This one “gives” money away in order to buy interests, invest in foreign “friends” so our corporations can either plow, drill, or suck dry foreign lands and ""main d'oeuvre"" for corporations's own profits (not the American tax-payer, of course!).

American food surpluses inundate the third world countries for the last 30 years as to crush their farming jobs, so their folks get forced to abandon their land and move toward cities where US owned producing plants await for them. No wonder that the first reflex of stupid communist r""revolution"" is to close plants and move folks back to the fields. It's just a reflex after years of corporate enslavement hidden under the false promise of a capitalism fair and equitable to everyone.

For example: The money that is “given” to Africans dictators so we can drill at will, while western pharmaceutics are invited to test their lethal shit to African kids and other poor African bastards.

I saw first hand your “help” in Tchad, when I was fighting for some European Army. I saw the US drop their pallets of dry milk in the middle of dried Sahara. (!) (and always dropping them in the middle of a crowd too, as a few always die crushed under the heavy pallets, I can see those pilots laughing their asses off) I saw dozens of kids died choking on that shit when their mothers thought that this was edible as such. The Americans never, ever, come investigate the need of the folks on the ground. The US “Aid” drops also daily pallets of drugs. Sure. But all used up, way old and often without any labels on them. 

I can write a fucking book about your “aid”. I invite you to read, “Confessions of an Economic Hit Man”, by John Perkins. This will give you a start in the understanding of that great charity and compassion from the US...

1. Hygiene so your kitchen does not get closed down. 
2. How to save money by not throwing away food, drink, etc.
3. How to deal with chefs, they are a very strange group, mostly on one drug or another.
6. Your staff will steal from you. I guarantee it, and in a restaurant you can stock take every day but fresh produce is hard to count. (How much salad is in a salad?)
4. How long it takes to get started every day, and how much time it takes to close, there is a lot of cleaning every day.
5. General good practice dealing with customers and staff and daily routines. You need a routine for *everything* and will easily spend 12+ hours a day just ""sorting things out"".
7. Make a plan for hiring out the whole place for parties of more than x-many people. Include rental costs and staff costs, then offer menus based on cost and stick to that cost. You need to make money.
8. The customer is not always right, if they were all the food would be free and the staff would have one table each. Good service is not about bowing and kissing ass. 
9. Learn how to make proper espresso, I never go back to a place that had good food but awful coffee. But then I was a barista for a good while and properly trained too.

If you have never done it, I strongly advise not doing it for yourself.  You couldn't pick an easier trade to lose money in. It is hard work and long hours.  I know chefs that owned their own place successfully but they had no life outside of the place and eventually just quit running their own place for an easier job. I worked in the trade for 7 years, quit because it ruined my health. There is a lot of stress and heavy lifting!

Equipment: get used dishwasher, oven, cooker espresso machine etc. Fridges and freezers just need to work, nobody will ever see them, you do not need new.

I absolutely believe that they are first and foremost people, and should have all of the rights that other people do, including controlling their own reproductive strategy (if they are able to), and if they are not able to, then they should be taught as much as possible about it and kept as safe as possible. 

But I can certainly see some of the reasons why parents and guardians could see sterilization as the only (or at least best) solution.  Sexual abuse in disabled people is alarmingly high- I've seen figures of between 70-80% for people who live in group homes and institutions.  While the obvious solution is to make those group homes and institutions safer, so far at least that really hasn't been something that governments are in general  concerned about spending enough money on to have a proper regulatory system.  What do you do with an adult with a cognitive level of a 2 year old who is not only sexually abused, but then becomes pregnant, especially if she is terrified by her own body or likely to be extremely traumatized by the birth of a child? 

Or take an adult woman with the cognitive and behaviour level of an 8 year old, who figures out that people will ""like her"" if she has sex with them?  How do you keep her safe at least from pregnancy? 

I know autistic girls who cry and scream for the entire time of the month when they have their period, and so far there is not a safe and effective long-term method for stopping someone's period without sterilization.

It's not just about women either- there are certainly disabled men out there who are sexually abused by women also, and while it's a bit more unlikely that they will cause a pregnancy, it's still an issue. 

I am glad that in most places in Europe and North America it is illegal to sterilize disabled individuals without their consent, and I hope that it becomes illegal everywhere.  But that doesn't mean that I don't understand how a parent or guardian could want it to happen.  ",1425932124,

You could spend an entire day inside and not see everything.  So, plan out your time there accordingly.  Be sure to hit the Egyptian temple and several room installations (that's entire rooms—chairs, furniture, *walls*—that they've relocated intact from medieval Europe or Ancient Rome to New York.  There's armor, musical instruments, and one of the finest modern art collections I've ever seen.

You'll probably also be interested in the Natural History Museum on the other side of town.  It's got some very cool dinosaurs, the Hayden Planetarium, and usually a cool special exhibition.  Someone else mentioned the store Evolution, which is neat also.

I think your time will definitely best spent finding the combination of your interests and what you cannot otherwise find where you are.

**Minor ""accomplishments"" that arent even Baby Boomer lead:**

- screen printed t-shirts - Aside from being of dubious merit, it wasnt even a ""boomer"" technology.

""Screen-printing was first patented in England by Samuel Simon in 1907[citation needed]. It was originally used as a popular method to print expensive wall paper, printed on linen, silk, and other fine fabrics. Western screen printers developed reclusive, defensive and exclusionary business policies intended to keep secret their workshops' knowledge and techniques.[5]""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikini

- surfing - ""The art of surfing was first observed by Europeans in 1767, by the crewmembers of the Dolphin at Tahiti; however, surfing was a central part of ancient Polynesian culture and predates European contact. The chief was the most skilled wave rider in the community with the best board made from the best tree.""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_surfing

- Rock and Roll - Maybe enjoyed by the Boomers, but not produced by them.

The immediate origins of rock and roll lie in the late 1940s and early 1950s through a mixing together of various popular musical genres of the time. These included blues, country music, R&amp;B, folk music, and gospel music.

However, elements of rock and roll can be heard in many ""hillbilly"" and ""race"" music records of the 1920s and 1930s.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll

- Mountain Biking - ""Another early example of riding bicycles off-road is when road racing cyclists used cyclo-cross as a means of keeping fit during the winter. Cyclo-cross eventually becoming a sport in its own right in the 1940s, with the first world championship in 1950. The French Velo Cross Club Parisien (VCCP) comprised about twenty-one young cyclists from the outskirts of Paris, who between 1951 and 1956 developed a sport that was remarkably akin to present-day mountain biking.[2]

The Roughstuff Fellowship was established in 1955 by off-road cyclists in the UK.[3] In Oregon, one Chemeketan club member, D.Gwynn, built a rough terrain trail bicycle in 1966. He named it a ""mountain bicycle"" for its intended place of use. This may be the first use of that name.[4]

In England in 1968, Geoff Apps, a motorbike trials rider, began experimenting with off-road bicycle designs. By 1979 he had developed a custom built lightweight bicycle which was uniquely suited to the wet and muddy off-road conditions found in the south-east of England. These were sold under the Cleland Cycles brand until 1984. Bikes based on the Cleland design were also sold by English Cycles and Highpath Engineering until 1988.[5]""

&gt; You have more of a say in government than you have in your current situation. In fact, if the entire population of the US was willing to fight for the same basic treatment that most other western countries get from their government you'd be better off in every way.

democracy is, inherently, a stupid idea. to imagine that gathering the arbitrary opinion of some ridiculously large group of people will produce anything _intelligible_ let alone reasonable is delusional at best. 

if everyone agreed about everything what you say about fighting for basic treatment might be the case. as it stands, we don't.

and it may be that i have ""more of a say"" than some other arbitrary scheme of government, but the difference is negligable at best. the effort required to change the course of an organization of ultimate authority that is beholden to no one is predictably large. too large to do reasonably. or even unreasonably. government does not have the ability or incentive to change direction in the same way that a company providing a failing service does.

and my argument may be philosophical in this conversation, but when you get to the &gt;30% of your income that you pay in taxes or that ridiculous number of people who subsist with no work put back toward the society that coddles them, it is clear to see that there are practical implications to this dissagreement.

Maybe there will be another 10+ years where it's frozen and won't change and people on the bottom of the ladder are just screwed.

Let's say the average person works around 30 hours a week at their minimum wage paid job next year. I'm estimating that, after taxes, they will make an effective 9.50 an hour.

30 x 9.50 = 285 a week. 570 a biweekly pay check, and 1040 dollars a month except for that one, glorious month per year that works out to have 3 paycheques a month.

On average though, 1,040 a month.

In my area, which is not a very nice area but it's not bad either, the cost of the average bachelor apartment is 600-700 a month. For a one bedroom you're looking at 750-850. And a two bedroom it's going to be at least 950, with some going up as high as 1,200 dollars.

Most people in a two bedroom will have two incomes, but not all families can afford that luxury. People on minimum wage would be left with very little left over for food and other bills.

One bedroom people would have a few hundred left over to pay the other bills, with maybe a hundred bucks or so left to save up or buy a few luxuries (a night out, once a month, or a movie).

This is only going to get worse as the minimum wage is effectively lower each year that it doesn't get raised due to inflation and gradually rising prices.

To rise that employee's wage by a dollar every year, for the 30 hours a week he works every week, it would cost 1,560 extra dollars a year, and now that we've broken the 10 dollar barrier for minimum wage, a dollar increase wouldn't be 10%. We're getting close to it not being upkeep enough to offset the 7% inflation rate per year.

Several other countries have a minimum wage that's significantly higher than ours. They're mostly in Europe and they seem to be doing just fine. I don't hear about mass unemployment. I know the UK's minimum wage is very high and they even have laws that give bonuses to employees that work ""unsociable hours"" such as late evenings and night shifts, to reward the sacrifice people make by working the awkward times.",1425932193,

About what? You can read those books if you want. I'm not basing the 'claims' on what is mentioned in Wikipedia *about* the books, rather, on what I *actually* read in those books myself.

&gt;The Horasastra shows a knowledge of astronomy that was common to many ancient civilizations.

Not claiming otherwise.

&gt;It is not true, however, that they were the sole possessors of advanced thought

Not claiming so either.

&gt;You act as if these facts are ignored, but they are not

They largely are. Ask any school kid who was the first person to claim the earth goes round the sun. The kid will answer: Copernicus. Check the wiki article on [Heliocentrism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism). It also claims Copernicus was the one who came up with a mathematical model of a heliocentric solar system. What I'm saying is that a fully mathematically rigorous heliocentric model was described in at least Surya Siddhant (500 BC), and this was known during Parasara's time (3000 BC) as his Horasastra *relies* on this knowledge. On Google Books you can find a word-to-word English translation of Surya Siddhant if you would like to see for yourself.

&gt; they did not come close to the discoveries of the *later* Greek mathematicians.

Guess the Greeks didn't come close to the discoveries to the later (2009 AD) Americans and Europeans either.

&gt;There is a reason that it is the Greek ideas that were preserved throughout antiquity, the middle ages, and then into the Renaissance.

As any civilization. Vedic civilization's ideas have been preserved well until this day, infact the system of Vedic astronomy/astrology is one of the most well preserved today.

&gt;Those are ancient texts that are at best recovered only in pieces.

No, a lot of these texts are 100% intact today. The Bhrigu Samhita has largely been lost however, after the Muslim invaders burnt several thousand books from the libraries of Nalanda University.

Why not? [Here is the original text of Surya Siddhant](http://wikisource.org/wiki/सूर्यसिद्धान्त) in Sanskrit written in actual Devanagari script.

The skies opened up and White Jesus descended with the sound of angelic trumpets and a magnificent white steed that was as good as, but no more magnificent than Reagan's. The crowds parted, and White Jesus approached The Wall. He put a hand upon it, took a deep breath, and gave it a karate chop. And another. And another. He began to chip away at the monolithic structure. The crowd began to cheer ... and then Reagan joined in with his sonic bellows.

Yes, as a matter of fact, they are. History has no trace of the ""palestinian"" people that extends past the early 19th century. History does have records which indicate mass migration of arab peasants into Palestine after establishment of jewish settlement because of the economical opportunity this settlement gave to arab labourers. History doesn't explain the phenomenal boom of palestinian birth rate. 

This doesn't mean that palestinians would have less rights. If anything, Israel's proxy war against the arab countries has caused the palestinian people to form a national identity that they previously never had. That's highly ironic IMO.

&gt;  All those pesky newcomers with deeded property that had to be seized by Israeli absentee property laws, a country not yet 10 years old at the time and plump with Europeans.

I always hear people mentioning the deeds and deeded property but so far no one has been able to produce a significant one that dates into pre-Israel time period. The reason for that is that the ancestors of people who call themselves palestinians today did not own land de jure. They were leasing it from their ottoman masters. 

&gt; Absentee laws where the property owner didn't even have to be absent.

Some palestinians chose to become an enemy of Israel, fought and fled, and their land was taken over, exactly as the enemy deserves. Others - two millions of them today - chose to side with Israel and became Israeli citizens who categorically refuse to renounce Israeli citizenship and become in any way affiliated with the Palestinian Authority.

Now do you want to talk about absentee stuff? Google ""ottoman absentee landlords"". Haha.

&gt; Personally I denounce Arab attacks on Israel but you've just presented an argument that can be flipped over and used to justify their paramilitaries as defense groups!

Anything can justify anything if twisted around enough. 

&gt; Do you think ethnic cleansing causes groups to mutate into aggressive terrorists Seth?

It may as was the case with Irgun, but that's not at all how palestinian ""liberation"" terrorist groups emerged. First, palestinians always were the initiators of violence. Second, the original PLO was created, trained and sponsored by KGB, and its purpose was not liberation of Palestine for arabs, but liberation of Israel from jews, and PLO leaders didn't even bother to pretend it was the former.

In 2006 Hamas offered a 10-year ceasefire to break deadlock over Israel.
http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/nov/01/israel

The thing is, Israel is more interested in land than peace. 

Israel is the regional power. It is the big mean dog, it has all that it wants, the land, military dominance over all its neighbours, trade, the coverage of the worlds only super power. Israel wants peace as it is comfortable. Israel wants to maintain the current status quo as is. Israel wants to impose its will calling it ""peace"" on a defeated people. Those who rule always want that kind of peace.

I dont expect you to agree with the Palestinian POV but at least to understand it.

Palestinians do not place the same premium on peace the Israelis do. They have very little. They have issues that need addressing, the right of return, the occupation of the West Bank, the annexation of Jerusalem, the economic shut down, the total control and blockade of their areas. They see peace as surrender. This is why they keep firing rockets. They want justice. The ruled always do.

To get Peace the Israelis have to address issues they do not want to. Until Israel is prepared to do that, there will not be peace.
Without justice there will be no peace

It can be done, like I said above, the UK showed the way when it talked to the IRA with no pre-condtions. No, ""edit the United Ireland part of your charter"" before we talk. The commander of the Londonderry IRA is now a UK member of parliament and Northern Ireland is still a part of the UK. By talking to the extremists, you fractionalise them, those that want peace, and those that want to fight. To strengthen the hand of those that want peace serious concessions have to be made, when those that want to derail the peace talks strike with rocket attacks and car bombs you have to be very careful with retaliation. Its a long slow road, but there was a time when Northern Ireland looked as hopeless as Palestine, but look at it now.

The PLO was willing to change its charter and recognize Israel, didn't get them anywhere...

The solution to the problems obvious. All the peace plans are essentially the same. Clinton's Peace Plan, the Nusseiba-Ayalon Plan, the Saudi Peace Initiative, Bush’s Road Map, Oslo, Taba summit are all pretty similar

They all include clear measures that Israel has to take in order to make peace:

1.Dismantle the settlements,
 
2.Withdraw its soldiers and civilians from the occupied territories, 

3.Create a viable Palestinian state, 

4.find a solution for the Palestinian refugees' right of return. 

5.Find a way to guarantee Israeli security. Altho' I believe having nuke addresses that.

6.A creative way to reward Israel for giving up what it feels it has won in war. $3B pa?

The problem is Israel refuses to go along with these plans. At some point, there will be an ""event"" and the talks will fail. developing new plans is a waste of time. Israel wants Land, specifically the West Bank. Israel has not dismantled a single settlement built there, and has never ceased to take Palestinian lands under the guise of security. This is the underlying tactic. The aim is to create a ""reality on the ground"" where it become impossible to uproot 100,000's of settlers. The palestininans will become a servant population within this greater Israel ruled by a compliant Palistinian authority. FATAH under Abbas fits this bill.

To end here a great quote from 1938. George Antonius

""The treatment meted out to Jews in Germany and other European countries is a disgrace to its authors and to modern civilisation. Posterity will not exonerate in any country that fails to bear its proper share of the sacrifices needed to alleviate Jewish suffering and distress. To place the brunt of the burden upon Arab Palestineis a miserable evasion of the duty that lies upon the whole of the civilised world. It is also morally outrageous. No code of morals could justify the persecution of one people in an attempt to relieve the persecution of another. The cure for the eviction of Jews from Germany is not to be sought in the eviction of the Arabs from their homeland and the relief of Jewish distress must not be accomplished at the cost of inflicting a corresponding distress upon an innocent and peaceful population"".

Obama Offered Deal to Russia in Secret Letter
By PETER BAKER

WASHINGTON — President Obama sent a secret letter to Russia’s president last month suggesting that he would back off deploying a new missile defense system in Eastern Europe if Moscow would help stop Iran from developing long-range weapons, American officials said Monday.

The letter to President Dmitri A. Medvedev was hand-delivered in Moscow by top administration officials three weeks ago. It said the United States would not need to proceed with the interceptor system, which has been vehemently opposed by Russia since it was proposed by the Bush administration, if Iran halted any efforts to build nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles.

The officials who described the contents of the message requested anonymity because it has not been made public. While they said it did not offer a direct quid pro quo, the letter was intended to give Moscow an incentive to join the United States in a common front against Iran. Russia’s military, diplomatic and commercial ties to Tehran give it some influence there, but it has often resisted Washington’s hard line against Iran.

“It’s almost saying to them, put up or shut up,” said a senior administration official. “It’s not that the Russians get to say, ‘We’ll try and therefore you have to suspend.’ It says the threat has to go away.”

On Tuesday, a press secretary for Dmitri A. Medvedev told the Interfax news agency that the letter did not contain any “specific proposals or mutually binding initiatives.”

Natalya Timakova said the letter was a reply to one sent by Mr. Medvedev shortly after Mr. Obama was elected.

“Medvedev appreciated the promptness of the reply and the positive spirit of the message,” Ms. Timakova said. “Obama’s letter contains various proposals and assessments of the current situation. But the message did not contain any specific proposals or mutually binding initiatives.”

She said Mr. Medvedev perceives the development of Russian-American relations as “exceptionally positive,” and hopes details can be fleshed out at a meeting on Friday in Geneva between Foreign Minister Sergei V. Lavrov and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Mr. Obama and Mr. Medvedev will meet for the first time on April 2 in London, officials said Monday.

Mr. Obama’s letter, sent in response to one he received from Mr. Medvedev shortly after Mr. Obama’s inauguration, is part of an effort to “press the reset button” on Russian-American relations, as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. put it last month, officials in Washington said. Among other things, the letter discussed talks to extend a strategic arms treaty expiring this year and cooperation in opening supply routes to Afghanistan.

The plan to build a high-tech radar facility in the Czech Republic and deploy 10 interceptor missiles in Poland — a part of the world that Russia once considered its sphere of influence — was a top priority for President George W. Bush to deter Iran in case it developed a nuclear warhead to fit atop its long-range missiles. Mr. Bush never accepted a Moscow proposal to install part of the missile defense system on its territory and jointly operate it so it could not be used against Russia.

Now the Obama administration appears to be reconsidering that idea, although it is not clear if it would want to put part of the system on Russian soil where it could be flipped on or off by Russians. Mr. Obama has been lukewarm on missile defense, saying he supports it only if it can be proved technically effective and affordable.

Mr. Bush also emphasized the linkage between the Iranian threat and missile defense, but Mr. Obama’s overture reformulates it in a way intended to appeal to the Russians, who long ago soured on the Bush administration. Officials have been hinting at the possibility of an agreement in recent weeks, and Mr. Obama’s proposal was reported on Monday by a Moscow newspaper, Kommersant.

“If through strong diplomacy with Russia and our other partners we can reduce or eliminate that threat, it obviously shapes the way at which we look at missile defense,” Under Secretary of State William J. Burns said about the Iranian threat in an interview with the Russian news agency Interfax while in Moscow last month delivering Mr. Obama’s letter.

Attending a NATO meeting in Krakow, Poland, on Feb. 20, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said, “I told the Russians a year ago that if there were no Iranian missile program, there would be no need for the missile sites.” Mr. Obama’s inauguration, he added, offered the chance for a fresh start. “My hope is that now, with the new administration, the prospects for that kind of cooperation might have improved,” he said.

The idea has distressed Poland and the Czech Republic, where leaders invested political capital in signing missile defense cooperation treaties with the United States despite domestic opposition. If the United States were to slow or halt deployment of the systems, Warsaw and Prague might insist on other incentives.

For example, the deal with Poland included a side agreement that an American Patriot air defense battery would be moved from Germany to Poland, where it would be operated by a crew of about 100 American service members. The administration might have to proceed with that to reassure Warsaw.

Missile defense has flavored Mr. Obama’s relationship with Russia from the day after his election, when Mr. Medvedev threatened to point missiles at Europe if the system proceeded. Mr. Medvedev later backed off that threat and it seems that Moscow is taking seriously the idea floated in Mr. Obama’s letter. Kommersant, the Moscow newspaper, on Monday called it a “sensational proposal.”

Mr. Medvedev said Sunday that he believed the Obama administration would be open to cooperation on missile defense.

“We have already received such signals from our American colleagues,” he said in an interview posted on the Kremlin Web site. “I expect that these signals will turn into concrete proposals. I hope to discuss this issue of great importance for Europe during my first meeting with President Barack Obama.”

If you have no particular idea, I won't try to sell you on my model, but I'd suggest getting as diversified as possible. Consider real estate if you can afford it, but I wouldn't concentrate in it with only that much money -- it depends on how cheap property is relative to what you've have to put down, and how low of an interest rate you can get. Having around 20-25% of your investments in property isn't a bad idea if you have a long term focus.

Buy some equities, both in Canada and the US (which have relatively linked economies), and internationally -- look at index fund type investments because they tend to be lower fee, and it's almost impossible to beat the market. Since most of your future income is likely to come from Canada, I'd suggest weighting heavily *away* from Canada and the US with the early chunk of your assets to hedge your future income (look at Emerging Markets, Asia, Europe, etc).

Consider a small allocation to corporate debt (bonds), which has historically underperformed equities, but might not in the future. Again, a very low cost index-type fund is the way to go given the amount you have to invest.

Consider a small allocation to physical precious metals (maybe 3%) in case your currency declines (Sounds extreme, but no currency has really lasted more than 400 years and the average is much lower, historically)",1425932351,

Where did I say it should?

&gt; $10.5 is more than needed to ""get by"", especially given that health and education is paid for by the government.

Where in Canada are you that university is paid for by the government? Do you know that to get a job that pays more than minimum wage you either need several years of experience, a university degree, or both? You are aware that a highschool education means absolutely nothing to the work world, right?

And yes, healthcare is mostly covered. But god forbid if you need some dental work, or if you need major surgery that makes it so you can't work for months, because $10.5 that's ""just getting by"" will diminish in a few months even after years of saving.

Medication is also not covered, so you better hope that if you do get sick that the pills you need are the cheap kind.


&gt; Instead it should reflect the current market and cost of living.

I agree. My argument is that right now it's not equal to the current market. More math for you. Straight from York University's website:

Full-time tuition for most non-professional programs (5 courses) + compulsory supplementary fees*

$5,524

That's the cheapest type of course. It does not include parking, transportation. It does not include residency or meal plans if you need to stay at the university for whatever reason. There's word that these prices are going up by 25% but let's just go with that number $5,500.

Let's take an example of 40 hours a week of working at minimum wage, dropped down again for taxes to 9.50 an hour (and that's NEXT YEAR, not this year).

40 x 9.5 = 380 a week.

380 x 52 = 19,760 a year. Let's bump that up to 20,000 to make the math easier.

Our example also lives in a one bedroom apartment. I estimated 750-850 in my previous post so let's go with 800 that's smack in the middle.

800 x 12 = 9,600 a year on rent.

Paying for a car on this wage would be impossible with insurance, car payments, and gas prices, so let's go with public transportation. A Metro Pass in Toronto costs 110 dollars a month.

110 x 12 = 1,320

There's also phone and internet costs. TV too if you want that sort of thing, and a cell phone on top of that. Those are optional though, so let's go with an average of the 4 and say around 70 dollars a month.

70 x 12 = 840 a year.

Food is a necessity. If you're living alone you can get by with 100-200 a month on food if you don't mind cheap stuff that's not that great for you. Middle value again: 150.

150 x 12 = 1800 a year.

Let's total that so far:

9,600 + 1,320 + 840 + 1800 = 13,560.

And that's with NO ALCOHOL, NO NIGHTS OUT, NO DATES, NO GOING OUT FOR DINNER, NO LUXURIES at all, which is hardly living but this is an extreme example. Feel free to knock around 2000 onto that total if you want to imagine this minimum wage worker is allowed to have some fun.

20,000 - 13,560 = 6,400.

So a year's worth of saving every penny that isn't a necessary cost equals 6,400 dollars saved in the bank. So it'll take four years to be able to afford the full 4-year course of education according to York U's website to get a degree to get out of minimum wage. This isn't including, of course, the costs of being able to go to University and taking courses while working. You can't work as much often if you have to go to school!

Even if University isn't a priority, do you really think that it's fair that after 2,080 hours of work over a year, that you would only have 6,400 dollars to show for it? You think this is reflective of current costs of living and market values? Excuse the vulgarity, but are you high?

&gt; Raising the minimum wage too much only results in fewer people being offered such jobs, as well as the cost of products going up.

Got any studies or proof of that? Once again, there are several countries in Europe that have a minimum wage that is significantly higher than ours and they haven't fallen into oblivion and collapsed yet!",1425932360,

Rapid inflation in most of Europe, but most notably Germany.  Jobless rates in Europe during the Great Depression around 30%.  In the US it capped at 25%ish.  However, notably, in Germany the rapid inflation with very high unemployment and a weak government meant it was fairly easy to Hitler to take over.  

Let's also not forget that the complexities of the time were they had no idea how long the Depression would last.  When unemployment finally capped in (IIRC) 1934, most of the damage was done in Europe.  Most Americans imagine America during the Great Depression, but rarely do they remember Germany.  I think this image says it all:

In the 1920's in Germany there was Hyperinflation:
http://www.romanbritain.freeserve.co.uk/hyperinflation.htm

Then coupled with the Great Depression (Deflation), the Germans got fairly well screwed.  

So while the Treaty did a number on the Germans (causing some of the Hyperinflation), it was exacerbated by the deflation of the 30's.  Let's also not forget that most of the world (save for some of Asia, specifically Japan) were being crushed by debt and deflation.  

The only thing that ""fixed"" Germany were civic works projects, but we can also see where that lead us.

IMHO, The base issues (overseas and nationally) has already been squeezed for all they are worth. I view them as a cold war dividend that have already been cashed during the Clinton administration. 

I think S. Korea would be off the table considering that N. Korea is very much like a hemorrhoid and tends to flare up at every inopportune moment. Japan = too big for the Navy no matter the price. Any bases left in Europe could be considered on the chopping block but the amount of cost vs. worth to strategic foreign policy would never make it out of subcommittee hearing room. Base closures were (and still are) very much political footballs due to the immediate impact on local economies. Those battles have all been fought before as recently as 2005.

&gt; Nice rant - but way off the mark. Here’s the point: Dubai is not a “business idea” - it's a real place full of real people. The reason it is as it is is precisely BECAUSE there is no oil. If Dubai had unlimited oil it could sit back and be Saudi Arabia. Instead, it has successfully diversified away from oil in a daring and existentially vital bid to get to a point where they don;t rely on oil revenues at all. As a result, it has developed a western-style economy which is totally screwed now in the same way as credit-card economies like the US/UK etc.

&gt;There’s plenty of vice in Dubai, even if it is rather charmless (as I imagine it is in Vegas). Every hotel has a bar full of Chinese/Djiboutian/Ukranian hookers, while the Moroccans, Syrians and Iranians are preferred by the rich Arabs and so have a higher status. There is also plenty of booze (although not much harder drugs). The key to understanding the place is to read between the lines rather than taking the letter of the law. The code of conduct is basically “do what you want - anything at all - but just don’t shout about it”. There are rules about what you do in public, but what you do in the privacy of your own home is between you and your conscience.

&gt;While westerners are pretty visible in Dubai and tend to be the main preoccupation of other westerners abroad (like the writer of this blog), Dubai is in fact vital for millions of other people in a region of pathetically badly-run countries. It offers jobs and opportunity to Arabs from economic basket cases like Egypt, Syria and the Occupied Palestinian Territories as well as loads of Indians and Pakistanis and an investment environment which, while incredibly opaque, is far less risky than home - places like Iraq, Iran, Uzbekistan or Ukraine. The place is also a vital node on the global transport map between Europe and Asia. Westerners may well leave, especially if the place introduces tax, but that doesn’t mean Dubai is dead. Far from it.

&gt;Dubai may not boast Parisian sophistication, and its own hubris has set it up as a target for opprobrium now things aren’t going so well, but I am still getting quite sick of all this nasty schadenfreude by western journalists who show up in Dubai, do an open-top bus tour for a couple of hours, and sneer that the place is a shithole and a “bad business idea”. It is not charming, but it has broken the pervasive Arab taboo of not achieving anything at all and for that it deserves recognition. And I can’t help feeling that it is exactly that that makes some foreign commentators uncomfortable.

This seems naive given the obvious athletic differences seen between groups (see Jon Entine' 'strawman of race article). 

Also, there are readily identifiable clusters of points, corresponding to traditional continental ethnic groups: Europeans, Africans, Asians, Native Americans, etc( seeRisch et al., Am. J. Hum. Genet. 76:268–275, 2005).

We see that there can be dramatic group differences in phenotypes even if there is complete allele overlap between two groups - as long as the frequency or probability distributions are distinct. But it is these distributions that are measured by the metric we defined earlier. Two groups that form distinct clusters are likely to exhibit different frequency distributions over various genes, leading to group differences.

This leads us to two very distinct possibilities in human genetic variation:

Hypothesis 1: (the PC mantra) The only group differences that exist between the clusters (races) are innocuous and superficial, for example related to skin color, hair color, body type, etc.

Hypothesis 2: (the dangerous one) Group differences exist which might affect important (let us say, deep rather than superficial) and measurable characteristics, such as cognitive abilities, personality, athletic prowess, etc. 

Note H1 is under constant revision, as new genetically driven group differences (e.g., particularly in disease resistance) are being discovered. According to the mantra of H1 these must all (by definition) be superficial differences.

A standard argument against H2 is that the 50k years during which groups have been separated is not long enough for differential natural selection to cause any group differences in deep characteristics. I find this argument quite naive, given what we know about animal breeding and how evolution has affected the (ever expanding list of) ""superficial"" characteristics. Many genes are now suspected of having been subject to strong selection over timescales of order 5k years or less. For further discussion of H2 by Steve Pinker, see here.

The predominant view among social scientists is that H1 is obviously correct and H2 obviously false. However, this is mainly wishful thinking. Official statements by the American Sociological Association and the American Anthropological Association even endorse the view that race is not a valid biological concept, which is clearly incorrect.

As scientists, we don't know whether H1 or H2 is correct, but given the revolution in biotechnology, we will eventually. Let me reiterate, before someone labels me a racist: we don't know with high confidence whether H1 or H2 is correct. 

Finally, it is important to note that any group differences are statistical in nature and do not imply anything about particular individuals. Rather than rely on the scientifically unsupported claim that we are all equal, it would be better to emphasize that we all have inalienable human rights regardless of our abilities or genetic makeup. (from Steve Hsu's blog).

Not true. This was Gould's weakest book, although it was well received in the media because it supported egalitarian dogma.
It is filled with errors and distortions. No one, not even leftist psychometricians (like James Flynn) take it seriously.

Gould spends a lot of time attacking old testing methods while studiously avoiding more sophisticated tests that strongly predict academic performance (and that the army still uses). For instance, East Asians (eg Japanese &amp; Chinese tend to do very well on the non-verbal section of the tests, which is consistent with their above average performance in math/science subjects - see Dan Seligman's ""A Question of Intelligence""). 

Gould also says ""Thurstone dispersed g as an illusion"" but this is horrendously misleading (see John Carroll's review Intelligence 21, 121-134 (1995), (also, Jensen Contemporary Education Review Summer 1982, Volume 1, Number 2, pp. 121- 135.) 

David J. Bartholomew, from London School of Economics, who has writtena textbook on factor analysis, also explains in ""Measuring Intelligence: Facts and Fallacies"" where Gould goes wrong in this area. 

Gould also makes some misleading comments about the early performance of Jewish migrants on psychometric tests. Goddard never found that Jews as a group did poorly, and there is no evidence the tests were used in passing the 1924 Immigration Act (see, Franz Samelson (1975, 1982), Snyderman &amp; Herrnstein 1983). 

Gould states that Morton ""doctored"" his collection of results on cranial size, but J. S. Michael (1988) remeasured a random sample of the Morton collection he found that very few errors had been made, and that these were not in the direction that Gould had asserted. 

He attacks Cyril Burt for fabricating his twin studies, but books since Gould's first edition came out have vindicated Burt (Joynson (1988) and the other by Ronald Fletcher (1991). Further, twin studies since show average heritability from these studies of 75%, almost the same as Burts supposedly 'faked' heritability of 77%. 

There are some interesting biological correlates:

“Overall, we conclude that modern neuroimaging techniques are beginning to articulate a biology of intelligence.

Also, EEG studies show increased neural efficiency in the cortex of ‘brighter’ individuals:

Article by Linda Gottfredson discussing how ‘g’ can be measured by psychometric tests:
…
“Some critics of intelligence research maintain that the notion of general intelligence is illusory: that no such global mental capacity exists and that apparent “intelligence” is really just a by-product of one’s opportunities to learn skills and information valued in a particular cultural context. True, the concept of intelligence and the way in which individuals are ranked according to this criterion could be social artifacts. But the fact that g is not specific to any particular domain of knowledge or mental skill suggests that g is independent of cultural content, including beliefs about what intelligence is. And tests of different social groups reveal the same continuum of general intelligence. This observation suggests either that cultures do not construct g or that they construct the same g. Both conclusions undercut the social artifact theory of intelligence.
Moreover, research on the physiology and genetics of g has uncovered biological correlates of this psychological phenomenon. In the past decade, studies by teams of researchers in North America and Europe have linked several attributes of the brain to general intelligence. After taking into account gender and physical stature, brain size as determined by magnetic resonance imaging is moderately correlated with IQ (about 0.4 on a scale of 0 to 1). So is the speed of nerve conduction. The brains of bright people also use less energy during problem solving than do those of their less able peers. And various qualities of brain waves correlate strongly (about 0.5 to 0.7) with IQ: the brain waves of individuals with higher IQs, for example, respond more promptly and consistently to simple sensory stimuli such as audible clicks. These observations have led some investigators to posit that differences in g result from differences in the speed and efficiency of neural processing. If this theory is true, environmental conditions could influence g by modifying brain physiology in some manner.
Studies of so-called elementary cognitive tasks (ECTs), conducted by Jensen and others, are bridging the gap between the psychological and the physiological aspects of g. These mental tasks have no obvious intellectual content and are so simple that adults and most children can do them accurately in less than a second. In the most basic reaction-time tests, for example, the subject must react when a light goes on by lifting her index finger off a home button and immediately depressing a response button. Two measurements are taken: the number of milliseconds between the illumination of the light and the subject’s release of the home button, which is called decision time, and the number of milliseconds between the subject’s release of the home button and pressing of the response button, which is called movement time.
In this task, movement time seems independent of intelligence, but the decision times of higher-IQ subjects are slightly faster than those of people with lower IQs. As the tasks are made more complex, correlations between average decision times and IQ increase. These results further support the notion that intelligence equips individuals to deal with complexity and that its influence is greater in complex tasks than in simple ones.
The ECT-IQ correlations are comparable for all IQ levels, ages, genders and racial-ethnic groups tested. Moreover, studies by Philip A. Vernon of the University of Western Ontario and others have shown that the ECT-IQ overlap results almost entirely from the common g factor in both measures. Reaction times do not reflect differences in motivation or strategy or the tendency of some individuals to rush through tests and daily tasks—that penchant is a personality trait. They actually seem to measure the speed with which the brain apprehends, integrates and evaluates information. Research on ECTs and brain physiology has not yet identified the biological determinants of this processing speed. These studies do suggest, however, that g is as reliable and global a phenomenon at the neural level as it is at the level of the complex information processing required by IQ tests and everyday life….""

Now they would do this several times, each time after the pig was set on fire they would take a blade and clean the pig up (get rid of the hairs etc). The WTF moment was that after they shoved a knife in the pigs throat, after they set it on fire twice and scraped it's skin off twice, sometimes the pig would still twitch, moan and try to stand up. That, and the fact that later that day we grinded up the pig and pushed the meat through it's own intestines, thus creating sausage. ",1425932504,

Not true. Read 'The 10,000 Year Explosion: How Civilization Accelerated Human Evolution'. 

Also, consider the Ashkenazi Jews, who average above any other group on IQ. This arose through selection over a relatively short period of time. 

G. Cochran, J. Hardy, H. Harpending, Natural History of Ashkenazi Intelligence, Journal of Biosocial Science 38 (5), pp. 659–693 (2006). http://homepage.mac.com/harpend/.Public/AshkenaziIQ.jbiosocsci.pdf

There are readily identifiable clusters of points, corresponding to traditional continental ethnic groups: Europeans, Africans, Asians, Native Americans, etc. (See, for example, Risch et al., Am. J. Hum. Genet. 76:268–275, 2005.) ...

We see that there can be dramatic group differences in phenotypes even if there is complete allele overlap between two groups - as long as the frequency or probability distributions are distinct. But it is these distributions that are measured by the metric we defined earlier. Two groups that form distinct clusters are likely to exhibit different frequency distributions over various genes, leading to group differences.

This leads us to two very distinct possibilities in human genetic variation:

Hypothesis 1: (the PC mantra) The only group differences that exist between the clusters (races) are innocuous and superficial, for example related to skin color, hair color, body type, etc.

Hypothesis 2: (the dangerous one) Group differences exist which might affect important (let us say, deep rather than superficial) and measurable characteristics, such as cognitive abilities, personality, athletic prowess, etc. 

Note H1 is under constant revision, as new genetically driven group differences (e.g., particularly in disease resistance) are being discovered. According to the mantra of H1 these must all (by definition) be superficial differences.

A standard argument against H2 is that the 50k years during which groups have been separated is not long enough for differential natural selection to cause any group differences in deep characteristics. I find this argument quite naive, given what we know about animal breeding and how evolution has affected the (ever expanding list of) ""superficial"" characteristics. Many genes are now suspected of having been subject to strong selection over timescales of order 5k years or less. For further discussion of H2 by Steve Pinker, see here.

The predominant view among social scientists is that H1 is obviously correct and H2 obviously false. However, this is mainly wishful thinking. Official statements by the American Sociological Association and the American Anthropological Association even endorse the view that race is not a valid biological concept, which is clearly incorrect.

There are some interesting biological correlates:
See Behavioral and Brain Sciences (2007), 30:135-154 Cambridge University Press:

“Overall, we conclude that modern neuroimaging techniques are beginning to articulate a biology of intelligence. We propose that the P-FIT provides a parsimonious account for many of the empirical observations, to date, which relate individual differences in intelligence test scores to variations in brain structure and function.”

Also, EEG studies show increased neural efficiency in the cortex of ‘brighter’ individuals:

“In the field of physiological study of human intelligence, strong evidence of a more efficient operation (i.e., less activation) of the brain in brighter individuals (the neural efficiency hypothesis) can be found”

Article by Linda Gottfredson discussing how ‘g’ can be measured by psychometric tests:
…
“Some critics of intelligence research maintain that the notion of general intelligence is illusory: that no such global mental capacity exists and that apparent “intelligence” is really just a by-product of one’s opportunities to learn skills and information valued in a particular cultural context. True, the concept of intelligence and the way in which individuals are ranked according to this criterion could be social artifacts. But the fact that g is not specific to any particular domain of knowledge or mental skill suggests that g is independent of cultural content, including beliefs about what intelligence is. And tests of different social groups reveal the same continuum of general intelligence. This observation suggests either that cultures do not construct g or that they construct the same g. Both conclusions undercut the social artifact theory of intelligence.
Moreover, research on the physiology and genetics of g has uncovered biological correlates of this psychological phenomenon. In the past decade, studies by teams of researchers in North America and Europe have linked several attributes of the brain to general intelligence. After taking into account gender and physical stature, brain size as determined by magnetic resonance imaging is moderately correlated with IQ (about 0.4 on a scale of 0 to 1). So is the speed of nerve conduction. The brains of bright people also use less energy during problem solving than do those of their less able peers. And various qualities of brain waves correlate strongly (about 0.5 to 0.7) with IQ: the brain waves of individuals with higher IQs, for example, respond more promptly and consistently to simple sensory stimuli such as audible clicks. These observations have led some investigators to posit that differences in g result from differences in the speed and efficiency of neural processing. If this theory is true, environmental conditions could influence g by modifying brain physiology in some manner.
Studies of so-called elementary cognitive tasks (ECTs), conducted by Jensen and others, are bridging the gap between the psychological and the physiological aspects of g. These mental tasks have no obvious intellectual content and are so simple that adults and most children can do them accurately in less than a second. In the most basic reaction-time tests, for example, the subject must react when a light goes on by lifting her index finger off a home button and immediately depressing a response button. Two measurements are taken: the number of milliseconds between the illumination of the light and the subject’s release of the home button, which is called decision time, and the number of milliseconds between the subject’s release of the home button and pressing of the response button, which is called movement time.
In this task, movement time seems independent of intelligence, but the decision times of higher-IQ subjects are slightly faster than those of people with lower IQs. As the tasks are made more complex, correlations between average decision times and IQ increase. These results further support the notion that intelligence equips individuals to deal with complexity and that its influence is greater in complex tasks than in simple ones.
The ECT-IQ correlations are comparable for all IQ levels, ages, genders and racial-ethnic groups tested. Moreover, studies by Philip A. Vernon of the University of Western Ontario and others have shown that the ECT-IQ overlap results almost entirely from the common g factor in both measures. Reaction times do not reflect differences in motivation or strategy or the tendency of some individuals to rush through tests and daily tasks—that penchant is a personality trait. They actually seem to measure the speed with which the brain apprehends, integrates and evaluates information. Research on ECTs and brain physiology has not yet identified the biological determinants of this processing speed. These studies do suggest, however, that g is as reliable and global a phenomenon at the neural level as it is at the level of the complex information processing required by IQ tests and everyday life….""

1.  Financially, they had a net income of 1.8 Billion in 2008 and $1.36 EPS.  I would consider that a success in the year 2008 even though they had a difficult 4th quarter.  As a whole, I would contend that they have been very successful.  The acquisitions of companies like Pay Pal show eBay's ability to streamline business processes and show immediate returns on currently profitable businesses.  The acquisition of companies like Skype, Craigs List and Stumble Upon show a dedication to business incubation.  These companies have potential for large future profitability that possibly have not been quite realized yet.

2.  From the outside it is difficult to tell, but I would guess that fraud is one of the largest problems with eBay.  This detracts users, muddles the site with spam and generally detracts from the credibility of the site.  I would investigate the costs associated with combating fraud.  Also, it is almost exclusively known for used items and home business.  I think it would be beneficial to explore partnerships with large companies to offer store solutions.


3.  Financially, they seem to be on a positive path.  The stock recently upgraded from sell to hold along with fairly consistent earnings.  The current economic environment does warrant additional fiscal forethought, but it also may mean deals could be available.

4.  Continued growth by expanding core products along with investment in new 'incubating' businesses.

5.  Continued growth by expanding core products along with investment in new 'incubating' businesses.  I would, however, explore the possibility of building stronger relationships with nationwide B&amp;M stores.

6.  Considering Pay Pal is a bank in Europe and holds billions of US dollars, this could be considered a resource of financing depending on regulation.  This would assume that financing is needed.

7.  The acquisition of new companies tends to lower the price of a stock.  This would be no different and I think the track record of eBay acquisitions accompanied by CEO statements would help the stockholders maintain trust.

8.   'How will you maximize gross profit without sacrificing the egos of the people who will be working for you (if you sacrifice their egos, they will sabotage you)?'  Although I think this sounds like an odd question (possibly a personal experience kind of thing assuming you are a CEO), here is my answer.  Ego is part of a person and each has their own.  The best possible solution is to try my best to use the unique personalities/egos to help them accomplish their goals with my oversight and guidance.  The CIO, COO, CFO, and CMO are all experts in their respective fields.  My job is to A.  provide vision  B.  Understand the issues of each area and guide the respective officer in his area  C.  Ensure that the respective fields are executing.  D.  Hold them, and myself, accountable.  Either the manager's ego falls into that process or it does not.  If it does not, then we will either need to make it happen or something will need to change.

9.  Troublesome is a fairly broad term.  I guess first I would need to identify the behavior that is troublesome, why it is troublesome and what can be changed so it is not troublesome?  Is it actually a problem or inefficiency with the business processes or is it the manager?  If it is the manager and not the process, what can we do to incorporate the manager into the decision making process on how to make this better for them. A bad employee though can be like a virus though and if it is truely a problem, it may be cheaper to cut ties sooner rather than later.

10.  Short term, nothing drastic.  I would focus on more customers than profit per customers.  It was not that long ago that rates were increased (I believe).

11.  Are you asking which one is the most pressing concern?  They are all pressing as they all serve different functions for different indicators/analytics.

12.  I would investigate and try to pay off the short term liability depending on the nature of that liability.  There was also a q4 dramatic increase of Other Non-Current Liabilities that I would investigate and will negatively impact ROWC.  Of course, I would also investigate expenses.

13.  Using analytics on current customer trends and goals, reviewing marketing trends and goals, reviewing/planning promotions/specials etc.

... alright, I could continue, but I have to be to work early in the morn.  Since this is currently not an interview, but some guy on Reddit, I do not feel it beneficial to stay up too late doing this.  If you would like to hear more, let me know.

If you consider the 25% Operating Margin you understand that this is a very profitable business and that the deal with eBay's sustainability is in its accounting management. I wonder if acquisitions are really the answer, particularly at this time where money is not plentiful and you need to turn over profits faster than ever. 

2.- Fraud is the largest problem reported in the media, but as I've said earlier, I'd be much more worried with how they handle their money. You can never eliminate fraud, but you can certainly reduce it and hire a communications staff to deal with it in the media. It is a pretty low cost thing to solve. Money management, on the other hand...

3.- Other than the opinion of a few analysts, what else makes you think that they are in a positive financial path? they have 3 billion in current liabilities. Doesn't that worry you? Why or why not?

4.- What products does eBay sell? I thought they were a service company, not a product company. What products could they expand into that match their core competencies? Please be more specific.

5.- Why would b&amp;m add value to eBay? Won't it substract value?

6.- Considering their cash on hand = their liabilities, and that their FCF is of only 580  million, lets assume that yes, indeed, you need financing for investments in expansions. Consider also that if PayPal as a European bank loaned the money, there will be a risk to PayPal and it may not be legal. They could use their Euro office to ask for a loan to other banks, like Cemex did, but then you risk investors returning to sanity and the US devaluing (like is happening to Cemex with the peso), and then you have a balooning debt. What are your other options?

7.- ""The acquisition of new companies tends to lower the price of the stock"". This is simply not true and incredibly simplistic. But let's assume it is true. So what? This doesn't really answer how would you compensate investors. Many of them are not buying stock for the long run and are expecting consistently positive quarterly results. What'd you do to keep them invested?

8.- You are circling the answer, but not quite there yet.

9.- Yes, of course, but you could also help the person get over what is making him be troublesome, if it is something about his job... Integrating him/her to the team would also be positive, don't you think? By the way, firing someone is expensive not just because of the cost of severance packages, but also because people working somewhere usually have expertise associated with working there. Firing them costs the company that expertise, and costs the investment in training new people. Smart managers always find alternatives to firing before taking the decision.

10.- Where are you going to get the extra customers? If you don't get more profit per customer, how are you going to improve your already outstanding numbers? How long before investors think your company is stagnated and will soon be in decline, and so have to fire you or invest elsewhere? But, really, is rate hikes the only way to get more money from the customers? Wouldn't it also be possible to have them shop at eBay more often a possibility? Are there any more possibilities?

11.- I am asking which is the most pressing concern, because each is determined by different factors in the business. I am actually asking which of these factors requires more attention.

12.- Non-current liabilities impact ROWC? Ok... Are liabilities the only thing that impact ROWC? Why don't you take into account the other factors?

13.- You wouldn't consider your investor's need on their return for investing at eBay to determine next year's quotas? How would you calculate a fair expectation on return for investors?

No, in my opinion, you don't have the skillset to be a CEO. At least, not enough analysis on eBay's business to figure out the future of the company. From what I've heard, your answers could just be analyst opinions on the past and present of the company, but not true insights on its future. Leading takes something else.

For instance, how well would the war have gone if the USA didn't have 101 aircraft carriers in the Pacific? Without the resources poured into the shipyards and factories in California, Oregon, and the east coast? 

How long would the Nazi regime have lasted if the United States Navy and Marines weren't flung all over the Pacific fighting Japan?

Yes, the eastern front was big, but the entire war was not along Eastern Europe. The Manchurian Offensive was an excellent military operation, but marks the extent of the USSR involvement in the Pacific theater, and it was in 1945 ... years into the Pacific campaign.

Also notable is that were Canada to have been wiped from the battles (in a Marvel-esque What If?) The USSR would have had it's hands full defending it's own eastern front. Canadians took a lot of pressure off of the United States, and Russia, with (no offense), an undergunned and outmanned force in nearly every engagement early in the war. By the end of the war, Canada had a Navy to rival any, and saved the USSR from Japanese invasion through pressure in the Aleutians, and more importantly, freed up the US Navy/Marines to have full presence in the Pacific theater ... leaving the fate of North America almost exclusively in the hands of Canada in the North Atlantic theater, while suppling much of the raw material used by England, and in Californian shipyards.
 
In absence of a Pacific theater, do you think the US, Canada and England would have been able to bring the weight of all three Navies to bear directly on the Axis powers in Europe? The answer is of course ... but also an exercise in fantasy, because in reality those three nations were fighting in the Pacific theater as well as Europe.

One thing America does not get enough credit for in retrospect, though of course Europe in general was thankful at the time for the lives of those American and Canadian men and women ... is what happened after the war as a result.

Much the same way the USSR built a huge war machine to deal with the Axis powers, the US did the same. A nation that in 1937 was pretty non-interventionalist, and among the most neutral and peaceful on Earth (as far as developed nations go) had become arguably the largest war machine the world had ever seen. No good can come of that in peacetime. It is the military-industrial complex that Ike spoke of. A lot of people knew the inevitable result of that, and we had no option to dismantle it. Uncle Joe's was just as big, and he wanted large chunks of Europe now, at a time where the nations of Europe were in no position to hold off Soviets.

The United States may not have ""saved"" Europe. The USSR had a large hand in that particular goal. However, isn't that a lot like saying the guy who draws the fire away from hostages and gets shot didn't help the snipers get a clear shot? Right or wrong, the USA *as it was* certainly committed suicide for the good of the world, and it's people, the ones the rest of the world understandably are frustrated with at the moment, once upon a time sacrificed everything their once free nation was, and resigned to live under the largest and most powerful regime the world has ever known without knowing it.",1425932623,

16 million US soldiers served in WWII, and 480,000 of them died, more than ten times the number of Canadian deaths. Canada did make the right move by supporting the Allied war effort immediately, but even being in the war for years before the US started fighting, Canada was unable to make any significant contribution until the US entered the war. Canada didn't stop the Blitzkrieg, the invasion of France nor the firebombing of London. Only with the might of the United States was the sheer military power available to crash back into Europe and drive to Berlin. And let's not forget the Pacific Theater, where Canada did not even participate, but the United States nearly single-handedly fought the Japanese Empire with assistance from the USSR, Britain and Australia (and China, whose military was slaughtered on the mainland).

So yeah, keep whining. The United States' wisdom in staying out of the war as long as it did is questionable, and most today disagree with the decision. But pussies? Even with a late entry, the US kicked a shitload more ass than Canada ever did, and took a lot more casualties. Fuck, you Canucks only took one beach at Normandy.

I don't think the rich get together and decide how best to collectively screw the rest of us. However, individually, this sort of thing has always gone on and probably will always go on.

Go back to the original feudal system of Europe and see how the rich few profited off the poor masses. Look at the various revolutions throughout history. Almost all of them happened when the masses reached their breaking point and refused to be exploited further. This is true for everything from the American to the French to the Russian revolutions.

Today we have a different system, but a similar result. The rich do what they can to get richer. The current economic crisis is really, at its heart, just a result of too much short-term greed happening at once, but those responsible won't feel more than a pinch. It's the masses who are losing their livelihoods, homes, etc. (Sidenote: that's not to absolve people who bought more than they could afford of all responsibility, but they mostly made the mistake of putting their trust in the system set up for them.)

The simple truth is that, in today's system of government, money is power. It's not a conspiracy of the government to make the rich richer, it's just a simple fact that the rich have the money, time, and notoriety to get their message to those in power.

And it's not like there's a solution. Communism was devised as a system where everyone is truly equal, but even in that someone always seizes power. There's always a group that is ""more equal"" than the rest. It's just how it is. There will always be those that want more and who are willing to do anything to have it.

The difference was that the Icelandic banking system was simply ""too big to save"" thus rendering the more common slogan ""too big to fail"" obsolete. Many consider that the way the Central Bank nationalized all the banks is what really caused the collapse. THAT IS BULLSHIT!!

It was obvious that at the time the banks hit serious shit that they were never (ever) going to be able to refinance themselves on the international loan-markets. They were DONE. So they did what every other failing bank has done; they went with their cocky ""no apologies"" attitude to the Central Bank and told them to cough up the money needed.

Thankfully though, we had someone in the CB with some serious balls to handle these greedy sociopaths who saw no problem in letting the CB spiral into the black hole they had created with their ridiculous financial doings.

So the bottom line is that we did what every redditor seems to think that US should have done. We let the fuckers go bankrupt basically. We nationalized all the banks and split them up into their domestic and foreign parts. We managed to keep the former going without major problems for the payment systems (a thing rarely mentioned but very crucial) and then the latter part will be put into administration and bankruptcy.

Another thing we have to keep in mind is that it is a huge advantage that we are only 300.000 in this country. So we will need a lot less to get us going again. We also have all the basic infrastructure that's needed, ie one of the best health care systems in the world, a good education system and our fishing export will always be here.

Referencing feudal Europe again, for one person to survive without working the fields, someone must be working those fields for them.

That's why I disagree that there is a class war. There is no benefit to keeping poor people poor. The benefit comes from using those people. For instance, when you are hired to do a job, you get payed. However, you cannot possibly get payed what you are worth to your employer. If you are not adding more value than they are giving you, then they are failing as a business.

Now, maybe this implies class warfare to you, but I disagree. To me, class warfare implies the goal is to keep the poor poor and the rich rich, but, in my opinion, that's just a side effect of the actual goal, which is to earn more for yourself.

That's not to say that there is no class conflict. I'm just saying that I don't think the rich are thinking in terms of how to make sure the poor stay poor but instead are thinking of how to make themselves richer. That the poor are exploited is a means to an end, not an end in itself.",1425932700,

It was only after the war became global that US military involvement was wanted and needed. 

I would hardly compare supplying thousands upon thousands of tons of arms to all of the allies to some RTS bullshit.

The time the Normandy invasion happened is irrelevant, both events were on completely different fronts. Furthermore, is hard to compare the invasion of fortress europe across the channel to an entrenched enemy to pushing back the mobile, albeit frozen and ill equipped germany army. Both were difficult tasks and both succeeded largely due to german supplies and forces breaking under the strain of the two fronts. I have no doubt the russians would have failed to oust the germans without the strategic bombing campaigns of the western allies. The only reason the USSR succeeded to begin with was brute force and some kickass tanks. 

The military history of the US goes far beyond Iraq and WWII you know. Some interventions were successful , some were debacles. Should the US have stood by during the bosniak genocide? Should south korea have suffered the same fate as the north under the despot Kim Il Sung? Obviously in hindsight the second invasion of Iraq was poorly executed and vietnam was a clusterfuck.

&gt;Thankfully though, we had someone in the CB with some serious balls to handle these greedy sociopaths who saw no problem in letting the CB spiral into the black hole they had created with their ridiculous financial doings.

Again, I wish that was true. The real reason is that the US still has the world's confidence and can sell treasury to finance the bailouts. Who in their right mind would buy Iceland's debt? The CB of Iceland didn't use it's big balls as you call it to say NO, they had no choice. What were they going to finance with? More debt? Where would they get that?

1) You are depressed. I've been there. You do silly, stupid, obsessive-compulsive things when you're depressed. But it can be overcome.

2) Finding a ""better"" job won't solve your problem. You shouldn't hate your job, but you shouldn't love it either. It's just a job. It's a cliche, but the common element in all your failed jobs is you. Fix yourself.

3) How to fix yourself? Fix your depression. Solution #1: Start working out. Solution #2: Find a creative outlet, like your personal website, taking photos, helping out with a cool opensource app, something. Solution #3: Get yourself laid more.

These things aren't just namby-pamby psychological talk. Doing these things change your hormones, which helps fight depression. Think of it as a problem which you need to apply a solution to.

and i do have a clue. in fact, i have better than a clue: i have an idea.

instead of lumping myself into a security group that holds _everyone_, why don't i lump myself in with a security group that holds only people on risk-factor par with me, with terms that i can agree to, unmitigated by the intentions, good or bad, by unrelated third parties. 

edit: i might even donate to an insurance group for high risk factors. i could go on to suggest that such specialized insurance companies could potentially be a boon to investment in the sciences.

&gt; If pay insurance, you're giving them money to not treat you. The less they treat you, the more money they get.

paying an insurance company is making an agreement with a lot of people through a single broker with the idea that the group's continual input not only covers the individual's expenses and the broker's costs of doing business, but also turns enough of a profit to satisfy the shareholders, whoever that may be.

but today there are a lot of restrictions on what you can insure, what you can't insure, how you can package it, etc etc etc. there are massive costs to entering the field and the outcome is that insurance is an oligarchy where the poor don't have the opportunity to get the service because the cost and restriction of being in the field at all mandates a certain profit point. 

and we could probably agree that oligarchies are bad. i also don't think they are very likely without government intervention, but, that is for another day.

but then we have opposite paths. you suggest that a monopoly business with ultimate authority is a good thing to enforce everyone to subscribe to, and i think that is downright insane. i can never get my head around how everyone _knows_ that monopolies are terrifying but can't quite grasp that the government is exactly that, times a billion. 

limiting the scope of what is allowable and available in insurance, and health care in general, extending out to the fda and other government tlas, ultimately limit the scope of advances in a more general sense.

There are reasons for this.  Meeting more stringent safety standards.  Increasing features.  The results of a Japanese and European horsepower war.  And ever-growing cars.  Let me harp on the last three for a bit.

-----

Your car, even your economy car, is a lot larger than previous generations.  For instance, let's look at the original Mk1 Volkswagen Golf.  It debuted in Europe in 1974, and was 145.9 inches in length, and 63.4 inches wide, and weighed in between 1740 and 2140 pounds depending on configuration.  The US version was a bit longer for crash standards, but only 7 pounds heavier.

Fast forward to the future!  The Mk6 Golf (I believe the US still has the Mk5 as the Rabbit) is now 165.3 inches long, and 70.0 inches wide.  It's also 3 inches taller.  And those stereos, air conditioners, heated seats, airbags, thicker glass, sound insulation, etc... adds up.  I don't have the weighs for the Mk6, but the weight range for the Mk5 is between 2920 and 3565 pounds (for the AWD R32).  On average, the car is more than half a ton heavier!

Interestingly, the new VW Polo (b-segment, which is smaller than a Golf/Rabbit) that just debuted at Geneva is now the size of the original Golf.  

This is for those folks who say ""my old Civic from the late 80s/early 90s got better mileage than the new stuff"".  Right.  Because the new Civics weigh 1000lbs more as well.  The fancy instruments under the binnacle?  That weighs a heckuva lot more than basic gauges.

-----

Next is the horsepower wars, and the reluctance nowadays of automakers to bring anything to the U.S. with less than 100HP.  I think there isn't an ""economy car"" in the U.S. (which is a mid-size saloon in Europe) that can't do 0-60 in under 9 seconds anymore.  We have ""midsize family sedans"" available with V6s in the 3.2 to 3.8L range and just shy of 300HP.  My boss made the comment that his Nissan Maxima (previous generation), thanks to improvements in transmission, suspension and tire technology, is faster off the line, to 60, and in the 1/4 mile than his 1970 Trans Am was.

I won't even get into the crazy stuff that the Germans keep fighting with, particularly the luxury marques.  Although I should mention that you can get BMWs in Europe with 1.6L diesel engines.  Yes, a 3 series.  Even a 5 series with a 1.8L I believe.  They get better gas mileage than your Civic.

We can get more efficient cars, but people are going to have to learn how to use their engines and transmissions appropriately.  Yes, step on it when getting on the highway instead of lumbering along, because that's how it's done.  Learn how to merge.  It's not hard.

-----

If people would learn how to drive, realize diesel engines have actually been incredibly, incredibly good for the last 15 years, and single people stop buying mid-size sedans and crossovers and SUVs when they actually DON'T need it, then yeah, maybe we'll see more efficient cars over here.  People in other parts of the world have 2-3 kids and get along fine with hatchbacks and Civics.  Honest.  They do just fine.  Hell, I do 3 weeks of groceries in a roadster.

The Ford Fiesta is actually a great car.  Hell, Top Gear's Jeremy Clarkson loves it.  We'll probably get it only with the 1.6L ""sporty"" engine.  Not the diesels or more economical gasoline engines.  The VW Polo that comes over will probably be a 1.6L, not the new Bluemotion that has ludicrously low emissions and does 30mpg BETTER (US, not imperial gallons) than the gasoline version.  They get 5-stars all around in Euro NCAP.  People get hit in these things and survive.  If not just walk out and say ""Hey, WTF!""

Until we show we're willing to change, odds are the manufacturers won't take any big gambles.  And we'll hem and haw about 40mpg Civics when a freakin Jaguar XJ (diesel) -- a full-size estate car -- does BETTER and still has enough torque to pull out tree stumps.",1425932961,

I can see why you and other gullible redditors perceive the creation of Israel as the cause of Middle Eastern woes.

It was just an example to burst your bubble about your preconceived notion that no extremism existed in Islamic society prior to Israel's creation. Just like the preconceived notions that the natives here were peaceful prior to European contact, when in reality they were far from it.

There are a lot of reasons for a male-female pay gap, and not all of them are related to overt sexism.  I don't see modern Europe as being particularly sexist, so I think the issue needs some more exploration.

An actual measure of a pay gap has to be made between workers in the same field, working the same hours, with the same level of education, and with the same level of experience.

Male-female employment rates, average hours worked, and average years worked are a different statistic.  The other thing that has to be considered is relative male-female employment in a given job category.

So - are more women chosing to be stay-at-home moms?  Are there women with equal ability to men getting paid less because of workplace sexism or differences between male and female social norms?  Are there fewer women in higher-paying careers?

Basically, how much of the gap comes down to the choices of individual women, how much of the gap comes down to social pressures, and what is the relation between the two?

Once we know more of what's going on, we can start to answer real questions.  For instance, medicine is a high-paying field that seems to attract women - is there lingering sexism in the field of medicine that keeps young female doctors from rising due to older male doctors refusing to promote them?  Are women taking part-time jobs to spend more time with their children because it's a choice they actively made, or were there truly no attractive careers for them that would make it more worthwhile for the father to take a part-time job instead?",1425932997,

Iceland's debt is 850% of their current GDP. Who knows what interest rate that debt is at, what currencies it's denominate din, or the average maturity of the debt instruments (I presume it's effectively bonds of some sort or stripe, though not necessarily). 

America's credit disaster will probably take us 20-30 years to truly recover from. We're at 350% debt to GDP, according to the article. Our economy is also stronger, and has a much broader base with more resources, natural and human, and more diversification.

Are you fucking kidding me?  *We already live in an economy of scarcity*.  ***WE HAVE SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME.***

&gt; but you're much too content with the socio-political/philosophical status quo.

Hardly.  I am a rabid proponent of liberalizing the markets and eliminating government subsidies and sponsorships of large corporations.  I am a radical proponent of FOSS softwares and technologies.  Such as RepRap.

&gt; It's 100% sustainable. 

I'm glad you believe that.  I can spot at least a half dozen flaws in your ideology -- not the least of which that it will simply never come to pass.

As to hierarchies and technology being a ""baaaaad combination"" -- that too hasn't panned out in reality.  Now, we can discuss BCI in terms of early adopters and psychological manipulation -- and believe me, **I have** -- but the fact of the matter is that this has little proper place in this conversation (and the answer to that one lies in vigorous FOSS softwares and technologies.  Sounds recursive, no?)

&gt; You seem to think there is no ill will on the part of the more privileged (whether intentional or out of neglect) and no suffering on the part of the less privileged.

Not even remotely suggested by what I stated. I simply pointed out physical facts; you respond with philosophy.  No place in the conversation, I'm afraid, for philosophies.  Only realities.

&gt; The have-nots are going to start becoming haves. What's the first thing people do once they become materially secure? They have kids.

That statement is not backed by the reality of the declining fertility rate in post-industrial societies.  The only reason that we continue to exceed the population replacement rate in America and Europe is due to immigration.  Second-generation immigrants fall back to the negative population growth totals.  The first thing they do may be to have kids -- but they were already doing that.  The first thing those kids do, however, is to **not have kids**.

&gt; A revolution in energy and materials technology is a baby boom. 

Not supported by the facts.  I refer you again to the fertility rates in post-industrial societies.  This is a global trend.

&gt; But, yet, we're expanding the definition of urban centers to connote city limits.

And yet, the global population density continues to expand, as entire regions go fallow.

&gt; We need to be condensing our cities even more, and tearing down everything on the outer edges.

That's coming.  The revolution in construction materials will see to it.

&gt; As far as I know there's only one vertical farm building in the works in Las Vegas. I haven't heard of any others.

Dubais.  These things come as they come; first with a few early adopters (the ""haves"") and then widespread adoption once the technologies become proven (to the ""have-nots"")

&gt; This means we're still importing everything. 

To cities, yes.  The US remains the world's largest net exporter of foodstuffs.  

&gt; The main thing is we have to get away from this thinking where we're constantly asking ""how much can I get away with?"" and start asking ""what's the right thing to do?"" Fear of punishment has to cease to be our motivator.

And the easiest, most guaranteed way to make that happen is to grant private rights to all commons.  As I illustrated.

&gt; Don't you think that there will soon be a technology that comes along that gives the privileged so much of an upper hand (genetic engineering, maybe, or AI) that it just obliterates things for the have-nots?

No.  A thousand times, no.  Economics is not a zero-sum game.  If we genetically engineer all the top 10% earners of society into being geniuses, exactly what do you think those geniuses will be doing with their newfound intellect?  It took *one* relatively bright physicist to create a cheap wood-stove for the women of Darfur and now that man is considered a hero to that population.  Why?  Because he cut the fuel costs and labor intensivity for those with the stoves literally to a third of what it otherwise was.  (Not to mention reduced the probability of rape and death for those women as he cut their wood-scavenging down to 1/3 what it was).  And that's just one guy.  Right now you could say that .01% of our population (going off of IQ scores) is in the league of that guy.  What do you think would happen if only 1% of the 1000% increase in geniuses decided to ""do something for the poor""? (Anthropy amongst the wealthy is actually much, much more frequent.  Bill Gates for example spends 50% of his income on anthropic gestures.)  That would be a 100-fold increase in the ""genius"" spent on the poor.

&gt; I am a rabid proponent of liberalizing the markets and eliminating government subsidies and sponsorships of large corporations.

Liberalizing the markets? OK, it's good to take away the benefits being given to corporations, but you need to redirect them to the working/middle classes. 

&gt; I can spot at least a half dozen flaws in your ideology -- not the least of which that it will simply never come to pass.

It's already coming to pass in many ways. If given more positive liberty in the future chances are better that it will come to pass. Like I said, I'm going to work on it for a couple years. It's a pretty good system, and I doubt you see any flaws.

&gt; Not even remotely suggested by what I stated. I simply pointed out physical facts; you respond with philosophy. No place in the conversation, I'm afraid, for philosophies. Only realities.

Whenever philosophies are flawed there is always a place for philosophy as a topic of conversation. It's a reality that hierarchies are unsustainable. It's not a philosophy, IConrad.

Haha, I didn't say people native to post-industrial societies experience population explosions. I said that newcomers to a lack of lack experience population explosions for this very reason. Who cares what their kids do? One generation could be catastrophic short of any focus on population limitation advocacy. 

&gt; as entire regions go fallow.

Regions go fallow? Just because people aren't living there that doesn't mean that land isn't being used/exploited. Cities depend on the importation of resources. If anything, people moving to cities is *worse* for rural areas. 

&gt; To cities, yes.

Yes, to cities. FROM RURAL AREAS.

You need to sort the different isotopes which is near impossible to do with chemistry, since different isotopes of the same element have the same chemical properties.

No, it is not necessary to to separate isotopes. Just elements. This is pure chemistry, no isotopic enrichment. E.g.:

Pu-239 - will be mixed with Pu-240 and others, and this does not matter for reactor fuel. Reactor-grade plutonium, with its isotopic mixture, is already reprocessed and used as MOX fuel (see Europe).

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOX_fuel#Overview

Moreover, it is *relatively* cheap. See: in France, they have 59 reactors, and a single reprocessing chemical plant, and all of their waste goes through the one plant. The absolute volume involved is very small, you see - 1,100 tons a year.

One more:http://select.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/opinion/12kristof.html?_r=1

He's also probably referring to things like honor killings in the Middle East as well. But in looking at those articles that I linked, you can tell that there is a much MUCH bigger underlying problem in that part of the world that is leading to the abuse and rape of many people.

Its quite odd, I think, to be so focused on the abuse going on, but not on the cause. The abuse and rape in Africa is going on more I think to shame the survivors left in the village, to demoralize and scare them as a tactic more than abuse because these people have anger issues. And in the Mid East it's also a really touchy issue because so much of what spurs the abuse of people there is religiously based. I'm not really up to speed in regards to the rest of the world unfortunately. 

This is an issue that needs to be worked out on both sides of the spectrum, with both the abused and the abusers. However, in cases like the Mid East, you're dealing with religion and we have to decide if the need to be PC outweighs the need to protect people. The UN has already made it pretty clear where they stand in terms of criticizing religion, so I don't expect much to come from them on that front. And sending peacekeepers and setting up women's shelters aren't going to be of much help either. In places like Africa, unless you stop the violence going on there you're pretty much giving the militants there a prime spot to terrorize people again and again.

I have to wonder about the emotional and mental damage of the men in the Mid East who are told to beat or kill their significant others or relatives because of some centuries old, out-dated cultural law. I'm not sure what the penalty is for not being able to dole out that kind of punishment, but it can't be good. Men just aren't doing this because its fun. Its a cultural hard wire, passed on for generations and any deviations are quickly dealt with.

The UN will never stop the humanitarian atrocities going on if it keeps approaching problems like this. I do not want to throw another $1B away just so that some organization can feel good about the shoddy work they keep doing. ",1425933161,

Kojève was an interesting guy. He taught philosophy early in his life and then gave it up when he came to his conclusions about the rnd of History and devoted all his energy to making it happen. He joined the French Economic Ministry and from his position there became a key behind the scenes player in the creation of the ground work for the EU.

Oh yeah, and did I mention that he was probably a Russian spy ( [lingua franca](http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/0003/kojeve.html) )? He also liked joking that he was a God because he had understood the movement and meaning of history (you have to read him to understand why he would say that). 

He was a brilliant systematic philosopher and the little known father of the French branch of continental philosophy -- most of those French names you know to be continental philosophers had attended his seminars on Hegel during the 1930's or were students of those who had. In any case, one of the driving forces in his thinking was to reject completely any religious or metaphysical view of the world and replace it with a world view that is coherent without God. HIs PhD thesis was an all-out attack on the thinking of a Russian mystic philospher, V. Soloviev, and was reformed into a manuscript that was published after his death as [L'Athéisme](http://www.amazon.fr/Latheisme-Kojeve/dp/2070749819/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1236278651&amp;sr=1-14). His later works were elaborations and refinements of that youthful work based on his new readings of Hegel.

Worth taking a look at; the style is quite nice (I would recommend you use LaTeX to typeset your CV), and it's written in a nice style.

Also note that the style and form of CV depends on where you're applying. You don't say where you are, so I assume you're American. Skills and acheivements (i.e., what you've done) are better to show off over there than in the UK for example (where I'm from). In the UK, it's more common to say what degrees you have, what grades, that kind of thing, first. And in the UK at least, it's either one full side of paper, or two full sides.

Nathan Rothschild sent his 19 year old nephew to trick Napoleon into loosing.  The kid accomplished that by advising Napolean into a situation where he lost his logistical support, thus Wellington defeated him.

The post WWII period saw the rise of the middle class, with more equal distribution of wealth than at any other time in US history.  The 1800's Robber Barron years were just that, rich barons stole the wealth from the workers by economic force.  The US was like South American countries at this time in history where an elite rich ran the government.
 
Northern Europe is heavily socialized and many rate higher incomes and standard of living than the US.  Depending on the CIA or IMF ratings, America is 10th or 17th in the world for income and standard of living now.  

There is a constant, these socialized counties have been under better management.  Just like a corporation, countries with better management plans, strategies and follow through will determine how competitive the company ranks.

Your seeds of thoughts are very much Right-Wing and a fringe element of economics. Your thesis runs very simple; Government is bad, evil to economies and millions of individual decisions will miraculously organize themselves into a vibrant economy.

You think that there is an invisible hand that creates order out of chaos. I think you have no proof that is the case.

What you fail to see and you shut your eyes to, is what Alan Greenspan shut his eyes to.  You both refuse to see millions of greedy, self-centered investors and businessmen making the self-serving decisions to chase riches at all cost.

You have no idea of the human nature behind economics.  You have no idea how illogical investors really are.  Investors just do not follow your's or anyone else's logical approach.

The idea that large groups of people are self-organizing for the best of the group is ridiculous.  You have no proof.  

Corporations need organizational efforts, management skills, setting of goals, monitoring, training, employee benefits, plans for the future and strategies and just plain governing in general.  

What makes you think National Governments do not benefit and need the same level of governing as corporations? What makes you think Government does not need to actively intervene in the workings of people, when all other forms of governing large numbers of people cannot be left to chance?  

Your ideas of how people will respond to freedom are overrated. You are looking at the freely made decisions of Wall Street Financials.  It has turned into chaos, not order. 

Every time a nation or government deregulates too much or does nothing, chaos occurs not order.

Usually you cannot and if you do you are buying it from someone who is a hobbiest beekeeper. So you won't find it in stores. I sell mine on craiglist and usually sell out very quickly.

Hobbiest are quickly becoming the backbone of the beekeeping industry. If you have a 1000 hives and lose half to disease or pests you are facing bankruptcy. If you are a small time beekeeper with a couple of hives and lose one your hobby isn't likely to bankrupt you.Here is the surprising thing. Hobbiest in my view are not having the issues that commercial beekeepers are having. Why? Because they dont deal with the issues that commercial beekeepers deal with. 

Most hobbiest don't use harsh chemicals on their hives. Most don't haul their hives from one side of the country to the other stressing out their bees. The lure of almond pollination fees can be great to a commercial beekeeper. To a hobbiest who isn't in it for the money the lure of having to haul bees across the country and busting their butt like that. Well then the money doesn't hold so much appeal. 

When the Varroa came into the country the industry made a knee jerk reaction and turned beekeepers into pest control operators. Pouring chemical after chemical into their hives to a point where Varroa became immune to many of the treatments out there. Most hobbiest don't use chemicals on their hives. I understand commercial beekeepers looking to protect their industry this is how they feed their families. However instead of looking for a long term chemical free solution they just went from one product to the next. Now the wax foundation most beekeepers purchase contains those chemicals. 

The industry has foundation with cell sizes that are not natural. These larger cells in the comb allow Varroa to get in and destroy hives. Hobbiest can afford to go with small cell or foundationless frames because it won't cost them a fortune. Commercial beekeepers would have to make a very painful leap to do this to all of their hives. However between what they pay for treatments and loses in their hive production I think they could do it. 

The industry feeds High Fructose Corn Syrup to build up their hives in order to have the hive be populated enough to do pollination. While there is no peer reviewed research. The HFCS appears to be a factor in bee immune systems and health. Most hobbiest feed sugar water or actual honey to their bees to build them up. Some feed nothing and let the bees make or break on their own. The result is they have bees that are stronger. 

Commercial beekeepers buy queens in the hundreds. Some even requeen every year. This is an expensive process that has also resulted in one other scary issue. Inbreeding. Current genetics on bees show that European honeybees (the most common type in the US) are suffering from a lack of diversity in their genetics. This has also been shown to have compromised their immune system. 

The beekeeping industry right now is under going a huge transformation and that transformation in many areas is painful. It is going to get more painful. It is having an effect on the price of food and health care products. 1/3 of everything we eat comes from pollination. Almost all forms of make up contain beeswax as an ingredient. In the US the wax is so bad that the cosmetics industry usually does not buy their wax from US beekeepers. 

I recently held the Southeast Organic Beekeepers Conference. Speakers like Dee Lusby, Michael Bush, Dean Stigitz and Ramona Herboldsheimer pointed out many of the issues the industry is facing. So while the numbers may not lie. The article makes jumps to it's conclusions. 

The commercial beekeeping industry is going have to change. In some ways change back to how they use to keep bees prior to the Varroa invasion. My concern is that they will make another knee jerk reaction to CCD like they did the Varroa issue and just about destroy the industry. Commercial beekeepers are not evil they are in many ways some of the best assets the agriculture industry has. They put everything on the line for their job. Many of them simply want and need a better set of answers than they have been getting. Also many of them are going to have make big expensive changes. 

So please support your local beekeeper. Realize that you probably need to go to a green market or similar to get honey from your local beekeeper. Because the grocery store doesn't have his honey. Local raw untreated honey that hasn't been overheated. You would be amazed as to how different it tastes.

Yes, there are problems here in Ireland, but they are being addressed.

Since about 1994, Ireland has been expanding at about 6% p.a., and after the hairshirt years of the 80's, we lost the run of ourselves a bit. 

Our new-found wealth was badly mismanaged by the government, who hired far too many civil servants during that time (some 120-150,000), and paid them and themselves too much for what they were doing. 

An average public sector worker cannot be sacked, has a defined benefit pension (their pension is based on their final salary), and is earning 40% more than the average industrial wage, while our prime minister is earning more than Barrack Obama, and can still have outside interests.
 
Bad planning laws led to an initial scarcity of land to build on and was primarily responsible for the huge boom in housing prices that ensued. Our financial regulator was completely asleep at the wheel during all this, which led to some people being given loans to buy houses that were 10-12 times their salary. There was also a huge over-reliance on Foreign Direct Investment, to the detriment of entrepreneurs at home.
 
To date, house prices are roughly 25% off their peak, and about 1000 jobs a day are being lost in the private sector, and our budget deficit will likely be 6% of GDP, even with the upcoming mini-budget in April.

However, we still continue to export more than we import, our demographic profile is on the young side, prices of everything are falling (we were the second most expensive nation on earth), we have an open economy, and so far, we're holding onto the higher value added jobs that were created in pharmaceuticals, computers and finance, albeit mostly by foreign firms.

The key to recovery, IMV, is to lose public sector workers, primarily bureaucrats, and to close down a lot of the 800 quangos that were formed during the boom. Losing the bureaucrats should be done by offering them early retirement, rather than redundancy.

&gt;Mr. PAUL. Madam Speaker, I rise to introduce the Federal Reserve Transparency Act. Throughout its nearly 100-year history, the Federal Reserve has presided over the near-complete destruction of the United States dollar. Since 1913 the dollar has lost over 95% of its purchasing power, aided and abetted by the Federal Reserve's loose monetary policy. How long will we as a Congress stand idly by while hard-working Americans see their savings eaten away by inflation? Only big-spending politicians and politically favored bankers benefit from inflation. 

&gt;Serious discussion of proposals to oversee the Federal Reserve is long overdue. I have been a longtime proponent of more effective oversight and auditing of the Fed, but I was far from the first Congressman to advocate these types of proposals. Esteemed former members of the Banking Committee such as Chairmen Wright Patman and Henry B. Gonzales were outspoken critics of the Fed and its lack of transparency. 

&gt;Since its inception, the Federal Reserve has always operated in the shadows, without sufficient scrutiny or oversight of its operations. While the conventional excuse is that this is intended to reduce the Fed's susceptibility to political pressures, the reality is that the Fed acts as a foil for the government. Whenever you question the Fed about the strength of the dollar, they will refer you to the Treasury, and vice versa. The Federal Reserve has, on the one hand, many of the privileges of government agencies, while retaining benefits of private organizations, such as being insulated from Freedom of Information Act requests. 

&gt;The Federal Reserve can enter into agreements with foreign central banks and foreign governments, and the GAO is prohibited from auditing or even seeing these agreements. Why should a government-established agency, whose police force has federal law enforcement powers, and whose notes have legal tender status in this country, be allowed to enter into agreements with foreign powers and foreign banking institutions with no oversight? Particularly when hundreds of billions of dollars of currency swaps have been announced and implemented, the Fed's negotiations with the European Central Bank, the Bank of International Settlements, and other institutions should face increased scrutiny, most especially because of their significant effect on foreign policy. If the State Department were able to do this, it would be characterized as a rogue agency and brought to heel, and if a private individual did this he might face prosecution under the Logan Act, yet the Fed avoids both fates. 

&gt;More importantly, the Fed's funding facilities and its agreements with the Treasury should be reviewed. The Treasury's supplementary financing accounts that fund Fed facilities allow the Treasury to funnel money to Wall Street without GAO or Congressional oversight. Additional funding facilities, such as the Primary Dealer Credit Facility and the Term Securities Lending Facility, allow the Fed to keep financial asset prices artificially inflated and subsidize poorly performing financial firms. 

&gt;The Federal Reserve Transparency Act would eliminate restrictions on GAO audits of the Federal Reserve and open Fed operations to enhanced scrutiny. We hear officials constantly lauding the benefits of transparency and especially bemoaning the opacity of the Fed, its monetary policy, and its funding facilities. By opening all Fed operations to a GAO audit and calling for such an audit to be completed by the end of 2010, the Federal Reserve Transparency Act would achieve much-needed transparency of the Federal Reserve.

Having fought bravely for Maryland and the Union, and surviving the Battle of Antietam, my father returned to the shores of the Chesapeake.   

The honor and connections accrued during 10 years of service entitled him to a hand written letter from General George McLellan and a steady position hauling Bluegill and Croaker from beneath the placid waves of the bay.

I was born a murderer 10 years later, as complications arose during pregnancy due to my unusual size.  The practice of uterine suturing had not yet been developed and my mother bled to death while praising the size of her beautiful baby boy.

Life at home with my father as pleasant as any child of a single ex soldier could hope for, and we were both pleased when my attendance at a small parochial boarding school in Baltimore was confirmed.  I never was 100% sure if my luck in this regard was due to my fathers desire for a better life for me, or his wish to be free to pursue his favorite hobby in peace - namely pickling himself with whiskey in the parlor.

It was at school where I learned to read, write and sum numbers.   This was achieved mainly by hand copying the bible onto a single piece of parchment which would then be cleaned and used again and again.   Woe betide the unruly student who tore his parchment, for a lesson in the remarkable delible nature of his own skin would be swifly delivered by a cane rod and a scowl.

Upon matriculating at the age of 17 in 1893 I became double blessed.  Not only did I posess an above average education but my father had passed on to his heavenly reward leaving me with a satisfactory home and even an inheritance of $500!  A princely sum!

Oh I wish you could have seen me.    Decked out in a dashing black hat with, a frocked coat, smart black leather shoes and wool pants fine enough to suit the president himself!  I decided to show off my class and erudition with a trip to the theater!

I don't remember the show really, as I was beaten quite soundly in an alley after the show and had my new finery ruined.   Also I was relieved of $100 but I had been given something of immeasurable value: a lesson in knowing my place.

My pastor connected me with a merchant in Baltimore who engaged in importing luxury goods from europe and shipping them west, where they would sell for ridiculous prices.   I kept his books for him (quite accurately I should say) until my untimely death in 1922 from TB.

First of all, America doesn't have ridiculous prostitution laws that fill up prisons.  We don't have a 'war on sex' that causes huge problem for numerous Latin American countries, as well as imprisoning large segments of impoverished society.

Second, there's nothing equivalently legal to prostitution.  Reasonably. tobacco and alcohol provide pretty compelling arguments for why marijuana should be legalized.  The same isn't really true for hookers.

Third, and probably most importantly, legalized prostitution hasn't really been shown to work.  Take Amsterdam as an example.  Everything that was supposed to happen when prostitution was legalized (the elimination of pimps, the end to human trafficking, the loss of power for organized crime) hasn't happened, and in some cases has gotten worse.  There have been a few studies recently (none of which I can pull up right now) that have shown that a large portion of the girls working in Amsterdam brothels are illegal, either from Eastern Europe or somewhere else.  

Maybe it would be different if all of America legalized prostitution so that no one place became a hotspot for sex tourism and the ill-effects that come with it, but that seems pretty unrealistic.  Moreover, the idea that prostitution is a victimless crime is pretty absurd.  Almost all prostitutes are forced into working through desperation, and while theoretically legalization removes the coercive elements, that hasn't really been proven to be true.",1425933582,

My dad was a pilot in 293 squadron (air sea rescue) during WWII.

In the USAF, if a superior in the mess hall said ""Get me the salt"", the lower rank had to comply but at one point (and my dad was present), a sergeant from the USAF told an RAF airman to ""get me the salt!"".

The RAF airman said ""Get it youself"" and the whole plot rapidly escalated to a full blown punch up involving USAF, RAF and MPs with nightsticks.

A Belgium that, of course, is surrounded by first world nations in a political-economic system that makes invasion an impossibility. You definitely will not be seeing Germany invade Poland any time soon. So the Belgium government can act like a carebear all it wants because there are no direct threat to it by neighbouring states. This is something that Israel is not blessed with having.

Belgium exists in a political hegemone in Europe that allows for it to not worry about its neighbours charging into it whenever it shows a sign of weakness.

On this example, specifically, it's a mental health problem, not a criminal one.

I can appreciate the argument that ""victimless"" does include some gray area... but there is a considerable black and white area that really ought to be addressed.

The fact is, prostitution prohibition renders illegal paying for something that's perfectly *legal* to give away for free. I can go to a bar, meet a chick, bring her home and have sex and be in the clear. But the same thing where I put a dollar in her purse after the deed is done, I'm breaking the law. There's nothing gray about it; it's flat out absurd.

&gt; The prostitutes there who are diseased, addicts, poor, ugly, or otherwise cannot get a license, migrate to other countries.

Well, there's a few issues to think about here.

First, this doesn't characterize all prostitutes. I can't begin to guess relative numbers - but there's a huge swath of the profession that consists of suburban housewives and girls paying their way through college, at rates around $300/hr, judging by Craigslist ads. If anyone is being ""victimized"" here it's their clients - again, this seems very black and white to me, and firmly in the ""not criminal"" column.

As a complete side note, this is part of the reason there's not a big push for prostitution legalization - escort agencies already operate as quasi-legitimate businesses, and prostitutes already pay taxes on their income - or at least to the degree that anyone being paid under the table reports their whole income. They just lie about the source of it - they claim ""self employment"" or something like that.

Of far greater moral concern are the streetwalkers - frequently runaways who fell in with a pimp and are perpetually indebted to him. On the even more horrific side of this you see what is effectively a new slave trade - girls from third world countries who are promised a job in America/Europe, and are effectively kidnapped and forced into sex work.

That's another black and white type thing, though on the opposite side - that's *certainly* something we should seek to abolish as a society. But then the question becomes, is a prohibition on prostitution, the act of selling sexual favors for money, the best way to go about preventing it, or the best thing for the girls who suffer from it? 

The answer is probably not - these girls need the freedom to go to the police and report abuse without fear of being arrested for being prostitutes. They need healthcare, safety, and *options* - the prohibition actually takes all that away.

Legalization won't end it - market economics dictate that the relatively small supply of girls willing to become prostitutes can't meet the demand, and consequently the starting price is almost $200/hr. There will always be a vast market of guys who can't afford that and are looking for cheap blow jobs which pimps will try to fill. It's the pimping that needs to be cracked down upon.

&gt; Should you have the right to sell your kidney?

This is difficult, but I'll take a stab at it.

Should I, someone of sound mind and body, conscious of all the possible risks and ramifications of such a decision, be able to sell my kidney? Yes.

Organ sales are kind of comparable actually; the thing to worry about isn't so much the people like me who might want to do it for whatever reason - it's the predators who are pushing it on desperate and poor people who are in the wrong. I'd suggest that the problem isn't so much kidney sales themselves (let's face it; they have value and an open market for them could save lives), but the equivalent of ""pimps"" who might push a poor person into it through manipulation or force.

It's kind of like saying that because some people take out sub-prime mortgages on homes they can't afford, we should implement prohibition on mortgage lending. Predatory behavior and stupid people exist in every economic sector you can name. What should be illegal is the predatory behavior; not the product the predators are pushing.",1425933598,

Union of Soviet *Socialist* Republics (U.S.S.R.)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ussr

They went at it whole hog.  One of the best things I ever read about the USSR said that during the height of the USSR they had to subscribe to western catalogues to figure out how to price merchandise for their people.  Think about that for a second. 

 Read some Russian history.  I know that the people trying to establish it always have good intentions but wow...

If by Europe you are referring to the EU, it is certainly not socialist.  I know they say that all the time on US TV but it just plain isn't true.  It is more of a parliamentary republic or something..they like to use the word treaty instead of constitution.  But whatever it is, most of the people in the Member state zealously guard their rights.  I searched the whole huge Wikipedia article and the word socialism or socialist isn't mentioned even once.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eu#Member_states

  Somebody better add that in there or they will think US TV is crazy or something.

   The EU is probably closer to what the USA used to be like when Federal Government had less power and the States were more sovereign - Give them a few more years with that central bank and they will get there though. 

If you are thinking socialist in the way of things like Health Care, we really didn't have a problem with things like health care in this country until Thomas Jefferson's bad nightmare came true.

""If we can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them, they must become happy."" --Thomas Jefferson to Thomas Cooper, 1802

""And I sincerely believe, with you, that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies; and that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale."" - Thomas Jefferson

I was responding to your claim that increasing the size and power of government is not capitalist.  The definition of capitalism is not dependent on the size of the government.  It's dependent on the policies of that government toward the market.  

I don't disagree with your statement that interfering with the market goes against pure, Lasseiz-Fiare capitalism, but interfering with the market doesn't necessarily mean you aren't capitalist.  Most capitalist systems have SOME kind of government oversight and control, even if it is minimal.  Lasseiz-Fiare capitalism with no government involvement is not necessarily a good thing (leads to monopolies and price fixing, abuse of workers and environment, etc)

Capitalism and socialism aren't necessarily opposed, either.  Look at Europe, most countries there run under some form of Democratic socialism in that they have high taxes that are used to provide social services.  However they don't have collective ownership of production and a completely planned central economy.  They are definitely both capitalist and socialist.  Even the US system has some elements of socialism, but is still capitalistic.

This all also depends on whether you are talking about ""small s"" socialism or ""big S"" Socialism.

Small s = progressive income taxes that are fairly high, providing social services such as welfare and healthcare

Big S = public ownership of all production and distribution of goods.

Perhaps someone who is better versed in economics can jump in and explain better.

Pardon the wall of text, but I'm tryin' to make a point, here:

 *There was the **Panic of 1797**, primarily caused by the deflating Bank of England. The Bank of England was tied into America enough that when it did deflate, it caused a huge disruption in the commercial and real estate markets in the U.S. 

 *The **Depression of 1807-'14**, caused by the Embargo Act which,upon passing through congress, absolutely devastated the shipping industry of the U.S. 

 *The **Panic of 1819-'24**: The problems brought on by the panic were widespread and destructive. As some examples, foreclosures skyrocketed, many banks failed, unemployment reached new highs, and a huge slump in agriculture made the effects of the panic close to home for many Americans.

 *The **Panic of 1837-'43** fueled by the down-trodden confidence that the American people had at the time for paper currency, which was just becoming prevalent around this time in the U.S. This caused a huge downturn in the American economy as banks failed and confidence plummeted.

 *The **Panic of 1857-'58** (18 months) wherein the failure of a huge life insurance and trust company, which was called the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company, spurred a huge drop in European speculation for the U.S. railroads. 

 *The **Civil War 1862-'65**... Need I explain?

 *The **recession of 1873-'79**, caused primarily by economic problems in Europe. This ignited problems in the U.S., and brought about the failure of the Jay Cooke &amp; Company, which at that time was the largest bank in the United States of America.
This helped to depress a post Civil War speculative bubble which had been helping the U.S. recuperate from the devastating civil war which raged only a few years before.

 *The **1890's recession**, brought on by the failure of the United States Reading Railroad. The failure prompted European investors to then withdraw their investments, and left the U.S. financial system in a shattered mess.

 *The **Panic of 1907-08**, was actually a severe monetary contraction that manifested itself as a recession. Many people lost jobs, many businesses went out of business, and many financial institutions were challenged by the panic.

 * **Recession of 1918-'21**, characterized by severe hyperinflation in Europe, which spread to North America. A lot of it had to do with the lost production that was halted at the end of WWI. This, coupled with the influx of labor that was caused by returning troops who needed jobs, drove unemployment through the roof.

 * **Recession of 1926**, often overshadowed and forgotten because of the

 * **Great Depression of 1929-'38**

 *There were two recessions in the **late 1940's**

 *Recessions of the **early and the late 1950's**

 *Recessions in the **early and the late 1960's**

 *Oil Crisis, recession of the **mid-1970's**

 *Oil Crisis, recession of the **early 1980's**

 *Recession of the **early 1990's**

 *Recession of the **early and late 2000's**...

""Capitalism is an economic system in which wealth, and the means of producing wealth, are privately owned and controlled rather than commonly, publicly, or state-owned and controlled.""

So a capitalist would argue against the government being in control of the production of wealth.  His/her opinion on who should ""fill in the gaps"" (depending on what this means) could range from private industry only (Libertarians) to the government (modern European socialism).

A centrally planned economy is opposite of Capitalism.  But you can have a large government without having a centrally planned economy, so saying that capitalism means small government isn't really true.  Capitalism usually demands that the government intervene in the market only when necessary (and there are many different opinions on what qualifies as necessary), but doesn't really say anything about what the government does in other areas such as social programs.

In the US is harder for a minor to get alcohol (and legal age is 3 years above) so you are more likely to use illegal drugs if you want to get ""fucked up"".

Also, trying to group all the USSR's economic systems into one label is not great. The way government and the economy worked in the USSR differed dramatically from leader to leader. Mashing together Stalinism and Marxist-Leninism is really blunt edged.

""The term “socialism” has been used to describe positions as far apart as anarchism, Soviet state communism, and social democracy; however, **it necessarily implies an opposition to the untrammeled workings of the economic market.** The socialist parties that have arisen in most European countries from the late 19th century have generally tended toward social democracy.""

&gt;In war, in combat, as long as the soldiers are there, there is an unavoidable trade-off: The more you wish for them to remain safe, the more you are wishing for them to kill others. That is what safety in combat means. The more you wish for them to return safely, the more you are wishing for Iraqis not to. 

I consider Iraq to be a mistake. It was a war of choice and it was a bad choice. However, that doesn't mean that there wasn't a whole lot more to the military action than just combat. The US military engaged in peacekeeping, infrastructure building, training, and humanitarian relief missions. The truth is that the combat mission is not even close to the majority of the overall mission. So, you certainly don't have to agree with why they were over there, but the diversity of the mission is a simple fact.

The author also implies that the veterans of WWII did more to earn their benefits than those currently serving:

&gt;I say that despite the fact that the amount of money involved in such benefits is not trivial and Webb's argument that his bill just provides the equivalent of educational benefits given to veterans of World War II is quite misleading: For one thing, many of those soldiers had been drafted ""for the duration,"" so it wasn't automatically a matter of three years and out. For another, the avowed purpose of those World War II benefits was to make up for what those soldiers had lost in regard to their civilian careers as compared to those who had not been in the military.

That whole statement is just crap. I'll ignore his absurd opinions on the purpose of military benefits, and instead focus on the facts. The World War II draft lasted for less than five years, and didn't even ramp-up until we started preparing the invasion of Europe in the final year of the war. We also had wartime production needs that necessitated rotating the troops back into the workforce, which effectively kept the active duty duration down. The result is that the vast majority of draftees served two or three year commitments.

Compare World War II with the seven years we've already spent between Iraq and Afghanistan. Service members are now serving 12 months in country and 12 months out, but they spent several years at 15-18 month tours with 12 months out. That very quickly exceeds the the average combat tour for a WWII era draftee--and that's before we get into stoploss, involuntary recalls, or the fact that the current average commitment is much longer than it was in World War II.

The bigger point, however, is that the mission and structure of our military are so completely different now than they were in the 1940s. So, it's just an absurd argument to make. And the contrast with the Peace Corps is just as poorly informed, because it ignores the benefits available to those who complete their commitment to organizations like the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps.

&gt;As for offense at his use of the term soldier... Come on. Seriously?

There's several hundred collective years of history and tradition behind the four branches of service. A member in any branch goes through very different training, learns different traditions, and has very different collective experiences. As a result, the vast majority of service members have a lot of pride in their particular branch. Your ignorance of this fact doesn't make it any less true, or your attitude any less insulting.",1425933745,

You don't understand that group of people. It's interesting how often that happens... that the majority doesn't understand the cultural ways of minority groups. A couple years ago, I was back in the West coast city where I grew up. And it astonished me to see that there was still this rift between african americans, and european americans. The substance of it seems to be that african americans have a different way of relating to eachother. They are outgoing and gregarious with strangers. Beige people, on the other hand like their close circle of friends and their walled gardens. So there's a tension because the majority believes the minority is being socially improper towards them.

In the same way bicyclists are a minority group... and those who create bike lanes, and deign the rules for cyclists don't understand the parameters that a cyclist needs to pursue his manner of transportation in a safe and pleasant manner.

You, as a motorist (primarily?), would think of the idea of people having to obey the rules of the road. That's what gives your life order and makes you feel safe. But in point of fact, you as a citizen of your town ought to behave yourself in a way that is good for your community and the people in it  -  that includes other drivers, pedestrians and cyclists when you are motoring around. Rules are only a prop in this other much more important task. Yes, cyclists ought to act in a predictable fashion. Yes, they ought to have a healthy respect for busy intersections. But on the other side of the coin, you when you are motoring have to realize that they have more rights than you do.... exactly because they are more fragile than you are. We assign more rights to minority ethnic groups for the same reason. We have affirmative action policies because that is the way things are made right in our world.

So, as the United States weakens, who is Israel to turn to? To help them, allow them, to continue its apartheid, rascist politices that tweaks the noses of some 1 billion muslims, if not all gentiles? Who will now allow Israel to continue to use its intelligence agency to undermine the nations of the world, by setting larger, but seemingly disparate peoples, against each other?

There are indications that Israel is playing buddy-buddy with India and China; playing the old the ""enemy of my enemy is my friend"" routine; perhaps using the siphoned billions from western central banks as a negotiation chit; perhaps Israel thinks it can go it alone now that the world has been reduced, lowered to its level.

However, as a CIA study suggests, there is a potential end-game where israel may find itself alone, fending for itself, against a world of teaming hostility, with its former protector, the United States, broken eonomically and feuding within itself. Ultimately, the zionists running Israel have to protect its apartheid state, and the Jews who live there, and here in the United States.

Therefore, it would be logical to assume that there could be plans for any potential end of the Jewish state. A new diaspora as this study suggests.

Because the an end-game implosion of the Israeli state can only be amelioriated by a mass diaspora of the Israeli populations to the world at large, it is logical that the United States would be the most logical destination for this new forced migration.

As the pieces of Jewish, or rather zionist domination, are already in place (largest population outside Israel, Israeli think-tanks &amp; PACs, Jewish dominated media, Jews in congress and the senate), could it be postulated that there are now plans formulated to use police state mechanisms established by Bush &amp; Cheney in the wake of the 911 false-flag to establish political control of the United States?

We are already know that Jewish populations here in the U.S. have effective organizing and focusing abilities (GIYUS.org, MEGAPHONE, etc...), so a hidden organization to aid in this transition may already be in place.

Let's start with the first statement. Technically, your ISP probably offers Usenet access so, theoretically, you could get it for free. However, the speed will be lackluster. If you want to max your connection speed (and you WILL, for EVERY download... unlike Bittorrent) you need to pay for access to a fast server. A lot of people use [Giganews](http://www.giganews.com), but I use [Astraweb](http://www.news.astraweb.com/). You also should pay for a good indexing server to make the download simple and easy. I use [NewzBin](http://www.newzbin.com). If you are serious about getting set up, shoot me a PM on here and I can send you an invite code (only if you are serious though because I only get 5 invites which, you don't get back until the person you invited signs up). I'll let ya know what software you need and everything.

There is 0% chance of getting caught for a few reasons. For one, you aren't sharing anything. With bittorrent, the copyright owner just has to download the torrent, and they instantly get the IPs of everyone who is seeding the file. With Usenet, everything is downloaded from a server. 

Also, the servers work similar to DNS servers in the sense that they all mirror each other. If someone adds a file to one Usenet server, they get propagated to all of the other ones around the world. That makes getting rid of stuff on there impossible. 

That brings us to the files themselves... Everything on the server is stored as text files typically broken into 15 or 50 meg segments. You download ALL of the files for the article (which newzbin makes easy for you... it's just one click to import them all into your download program) and then you convert/decode them on your PC. The files are typically decoded back to a rar files which can then be extracted by opening any of the segments and extracting like normal. So technically, you aren't downloading rar files, but files that have been encoded into text files (that were originally rars). That means anyone watching your traffic can't really prove you have done anything illegal. In fact, you aren't physically breaking the law until you decode them and extract. Your intent is still there but that's hard to prove.

Lastly, Astraweb and Giganews both take the privacy of their customers very seriously. They don't keep any logs what you downloaded or anything like that. They just keep overall stats like the amount you have downloaded and stuff like that. You can even choose a server that isn't in your country if you wish (I use the European server). For me, it's just as fast.

In a recent interview with the German financial site Welt Online the CEO of Goldman, Lloyd Blankfein, said that the explanation for Goldman's strength through the financial crisis was based on luck. No kidding. Here's the quote. 

WELT ONLINE: Why did Goldman Sachs come through the crisis in a better position than all of the other major western banks? Was it luck or skill?

Blankfein: We've been lucky for the last 140 years!  


Very funny man. I suppose it's easy to be a funny guy when you're so well connected to such a happy-go-lucky group of pals. Interesting coincidence how luck manages to strike the TARP mastermind Henry Paulson's good buddies at Goldman.

It's a funny thing about these jokers like Paulson that they can be such a cute bunch of sweethearts when cutting secret deals for their friends, but when they're addressing Congress they start talking about martial law and all this. 

Well, okay, so Goldman deserves the six B's because they're lucky guys. Nuff said eh? 

But what about Deutche Bank? Isn't the German government's own reaction to the crisis considered tight-fisted by its European neighbors? If the Germans are not putting up their own money, why are American taxpayers being asked to buy up their bogus insurance policies? And why is all of this being done in secret?

Subprime Europe

By LIAQUAT AHAMED
Published: March 7, 2009 

THE 1931 collapse of the Austrian bank Creditanstalt provoked financial panic across Europe and almost single-handedly turned a bad downturn into the Great Depression. Last week, when I read about the brewing European banking crisis, I suddenly began to dread that history might be repeating itself.

You might think that my worries are a bit late. After all, losses on subprime mortgages in the United States have already caused a Depression-like banking collapse. Well, believe it or not, Europe’s current crisis is scarier. For while losses on Eastern European debts may be only a small fraction of those on subprime mortgages, the continent’s problems are politically harder to solve, and their consequences may prove to be much worse.

Much as in our subprime mess, Eastern Europe’s problems began with easy credit. From 2004 to 2008 Eastern Europe had its own bubble, fueled by the ready availability of international credit. In recent years countries like Bulgaria and Latvia borrowed annually the equivalent of more than 20 percent of their gross domestic product from abroad. By 2008, 13 countries that were once part of the Soviet empire had accumulated a collective debt to foreign banks or in foreign currencies of more than $1 trillion. Some of the money went into investment, much of it into consumption or real estate.

When the music stopped last year and banks retrenched, the flow of new capital to Eastern Europe came to an abrupt halt, and then reversed direction. This credit crunch hit the region just as its main export markets in Western Europe were going into free fall. Moreover, with so much of the debt denominated in foreign currencies, everyone in Eastern Europe has been scrambling to get their hands on foreign exchange and local currencies have collapsed.

Most of the Eastern European debt is held by Western European banks. It also turned out that some of the biggest lenders to Eastern Europe were Austrian and Italian banks — for example, loans by Austrian banks to Eastern European countries are almost equivalent to 70 percent of Austria’s G.D.P. Now, Italy and Austria can’t afford to bail out even their own banks.

The debt crisis in Eastern Europe is much more than an economic problem. The wrenching decline in the standard of living caused by this crisis is provoking social unrest. American subprime borrowers who have had their houses foreclosed on are not — at least not yet — rioting in the streets. Workers in Eastern Europe are. The roots of democracy in the region are not deep and the specter of right-wing nationalism remains a threat.

So what is to be done? The potential approaches essentially mirror those that have been attempted in response to America’s subprime problem.

The first approach is to deal with the short-run liquidity problem. In the same way that the Federal Reserve expanded its own lending last year to compensate for the collapse in private lending, the International Monetary Fund is providing funds to Eastern Europe, and Hungary has proposed that the European Central Bank lend to borrowers who use non-euro assets as collateral. But given the state of the rest of the world, Eastern Europe will not be able to export its way out of its troubles in the immediate future.

The debts of many Eastern European countries and some banks will have to be written off. Ultimately, as in the case of the American subprime debts, taxpayers will have to foot the bill. But which taxpayers? The taxpayers of Austria and Italy certainly can’t. So the burden will have to fall on the rich countries of Europe, especially Germany and France.

There are two approaches to taxpayer-financed bailouts. The first is to go case by case. This is being proposed by the Germans. The problem here, as we discovered after the Bear Stearns rescue last March, is that the case-by-case approach does nothing to establish confidence in the system and prevent contagion.

The best choice would be a fund that provides bailout money and a protective umbrella to banks and countries, even those that don’t seem to need it now. Hungary has proposed the creation of such a fund with roughly $240 billion at its disposal. Though the proposal has already been rejected by stronger European economies, the American experience of last year in which the Treasury finally had to ask Congress for $700 billion for a similar fund suggests that this is where Europe will end up.

The response of the American government to the financial crisis has been criticized for being too slow and inadequate. But at least we have a federal budget, the national cohesion and the political machinery to get New Yorkers and Midwesterners to pay for the mistakes of homeowners in California and Florida, or to bail out a bank based in North Carolina. There is no such mechanism in Europe. It is going to require leadership of the highest order from officials in Germany and France to persuade their thrifty and prudent taxpayers to bail out foolhardy Austrian banks or Hungarian homeowners.

The Great Depression was largely caused by a failure of intellectual will. In other words, the men in charge simply did not understand how the economy worked. Now, it is the failure of political will that could lead to economic cataclysm. Nowhere is this danger more real than in Europe.

I was pretty much a fun rider in the states for a couple of years before I started to commute seriously by bike, it is no way meant to be an insulting term.  Just that different people use bikes for different things, and recreational riders tend to have a much different view of riding than commuters.  For instance, in Florida they have a habit of adding bike paths off to the side of the road that often go for several miles without convenient road intersections - for weekend fun riders, this is fine, but for commuters who need to get onto other roads, it is an issue.  Many of my recreational riding friends would often ask me why so many cyclists used the road when the path was available - the idea of having to make left turns at places without intersections hadn't ocurred to them - no because they were stupid, but just because it wasn't something they had had to do.  So sorry for taking your initial comment as a literal description of your riding, but I hope you can see where it did seem to imply that.

I have seen some cyclists blow through stop signs in SF - it is a problem, and it needs to be enforced for safety reasons.  If the law requires a stop, it's what people expect, and blwoing through it is incredibly discourteous to others on the road.  However, it does not seem to be the majority of cyclists.  Most of the people I saw tended to be like me - we rode in traffic when it was safe, in bike lanes when safe, and put up with occasional honking and yelling from drivers.  It was not terrible, but it certainly wasn't as pleasant as it could be.

Also, cars seem to break laws just as often as cyclists, they just tend to break different laws.  I often travel on surface streets in the states with 25mph speed limits, going 25, and have cars passing me all the time at much higher speeds.  So I don't think either group is particularly better than the other in terms of obeying laws.

In your comment, you make mention of things that need to improve.  That is simply my point - we should improve these things until we are on par with first world countries.  In Europe, it is very easy to travel by any mode of transportation (car, bike, walking, train, bus.)

Personally I do believe in Europe and the construction of an European identity under Europeans doesn't have come fully from below. I mean, when the national identities of European nations was constructed centuries ago, there wasn't some sort of referendum for the peasants to vote on, it simply was imposed. Silly comparison yes, I know, but it gets the point across.

But EU institutions do not always help with identity construction. For example, look at the European Parliament elections later this year. You can only vote for national parties there and as a result it becomes some second-grade national election, where you can protest-vote against the incumbent government. It's just stupid. There should be EU-wide lists. I want to be able to vote for a German, a Chezch or a Greek because of his ideas. 

What Europe needs is a debate on Europe by it's citizens on a European level, not just weakly on a national level with national parties.

The maintenance on the highways is very expensive, and we are probably hundreds of billions of dollars behind in mantaining them, particularly the bridges.  

It would be much more efficient to have people, cars, and freight moved on rail lines.  The cost of installation is much less, trains are much more fuel efficient, and you could have rail lines instead where you could just put your cars on a rail car if you wanted to to Florida on vacation.  Your car would go from getting 20 mpg to 200 mpg, and you wouldn't have to actually drive it.

Plus, how many serious accidents and deaths are caused by having the interstate highway system?  One inattentive driver can cause massive backups for hours or even potentially days if they take out a bridge.  Trains are run by professional drivers and are computer controlled to all but prevent accidents.  Plus their speeds are electronically controlled so there is no possibility of exceeding the speed limit.  

Obviously, I'm playing Devil's Advocate.  

I'm pretty conservative, but no, 'all government spending' is not bad.  Some of it is actually good.  My beef is when it is wasteful or inefficent.  

For instance, in many cities they spend $10,000/student for education.  If you have 25 students in the classroom, you can take $50,000 to pay for the teacher, and $50,000 to pay for the classroom and fractional use of the playgrounds.  Heck, figure $50,000 to bus the kids to and from school, and $25,000 for 'administration'

That still leaves $75,000 per classroom for supplies, books, computers, and whatever else they need.   That's $3,000/student.  If you bought each of them a $500 computer (every year), and $500 in books (more than I spent in college, and you can use elementary schoolbooks for years.  Addition and Fractions haven't changed in at least 500 years), you still have $2000 left per student, or $50,000 after the expenses are paid.  Where is the rest of the money going?

We need to do 0 based budgeting for government.  In other words, if you spend less than you are budgeted for (oh the horror), it shouldn't affect next years budget in a negative way.  Currently, if you have a budget for $10 million dollars, and only spend $9 million, then next year's budget is cut 10%, even though you might actually need more money the next year.  To prevent that from happening, departments then waste the extra $1 million to keep their budgets up.  Under 0 based, it looks at each year independently.  

My main beef with taxes is that I think everybody should pay something in.  That way you become concerned with how it is spent.  If you make $20,000/year, and get a $1300 EIC (or whatever it is, doesn't particularly matter), you don't care how tax money is spent, because you haven't paid in.  If you make $20,000/year, and you pay IN $200, then you suddenly care if Robert Byrd wants a gold plated bird cage in Charston, because that could be your $200 paying for it.  

And we certainly shouldn't be paying for Citibank's or BoA's screw ups.  

As far as high speed trains go, if they go somewhere where people/freight will go, then great.  But don't make them like the MARTA system in Atlanta where they don't go to the baseball stadium because the city owned the parking lots.  If they follow corridors that people will use, great, let's build them.  If they are going to be built from Alliance, Nebraska to Aberdeen, South Dakota (random small town) because some congressional fishing buddies happen to live at one end and want to fish at the other end, then we shouldn't build them.

If we are going to do this, then lets do something like the BRAC committee and do it based on realistic traffic studies.  

For instance, between LA and Las Vegas, is there enough traffic to justify it at the price point, versus flying or driving?  That's what needs to be answered.  Not whether it is 'cool', 'modern', or 'won't the Europeans/Japanese be jealous'.    ",1425934261,

... Yeah. I wrote ""in a political-economic system that makes invasion an impossibility."" That's the EU. It's also a little bit more than just the EU, such as centuries of state on state diplomacy and stable recognition of statehood.

This is something that the region in the middle east does not have.

&gt;They seek to expand.

If Israel sought to expand it would have kept the Sinai from the six day war. If Israel sought to expand it would have flattened Lebanon. With the billions of dollars of equipment that Israel gets from the USA it could have easily squashed its neighbours and taken its land if it wanted to. It is not the goal of Israel to expand. Rather, it's to protect itself. 

As I said before, Israel doesn't have this system in place protecting it. It needs to defend itself and is pressured to do so by the countries and groups surrounding it.

&gt;Look up ""ethnic cleansing"".

Where's your source for the ethnic cleansing of 85% of Palestinians? I would like to see that statistic and who published it. You still haven't addressed that issue, Mredd.

[Ethnic cleansing](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/genocide) and [genocide](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/genocide) can be used interchangeably. It's the action of harming a specific group of people based on a common characteristic--in this case it's ethnicity--with an emphasis on killing them. Ethnic cleansing, in addition to the killing off of the victim, does have the caveat of also pushing them out of a region. Still, though, when you think about Rwanda and its ethnic cleansing, the goal of the Hutus was to kill all of the Tutsis. The people just happened to run away because they didn't want to be killed. The killing part **still remains** as the primary part of the definition of ethnic cleansing.

The main point remains the same. Where is your source for the killing of 85% of Palestinians, or at least a sizable portion of that 85%. Because, in all seriousness, I haven't noticed any gas chambers in Israel.

&gt;That makes you a racist.

That's nice.

&gt;You're just spewing out the typical propaganda lies you've been feed by your religion.

The conference is a joke. None of these ""elite scientists"" can get enough evidence together to publish. In fact, for published papers that state climate change is not human induced is 1000:1 against.

This conference is a publicity stunt to make the public believe there is credible evidence against human caused global warming. There is not.

""Some argue that although race is a valid taxonomic concept in other species, it cannot be applied to humans. Many scientists have argued that race definitions are imprecise, arbitrary, derived from custom, have many exceptions, have many gradations, and that the numbers of races delineated vary according to the culture making the racial distinctions; thus they reject the notion that any definition of race pertaining to humans can have taxonomic rigour and validity. Today many scientists study human genotypic and phenotypic variation using concepts such as ""population"" and ""clinal gradation"". Many contend that while racial categorizations may be marked by phenotypic or genotypic traits, the idea of race itself, and actual divisions of persons into races or racial groups, are social constructs.""

""Firstly, the whole concept of the 'role model' is flawed - the only 'role models' that matter are those in our immediate life, ie our parents. There is NO evidence that the concept of the 'role model' so often parroted by PC feminists and others has any validity; it's just another PC psychobabble american smelly nonsense word.

Secondly, the Fawcett Society published this report - as usual it is a misandrist, victim culture sob story lie from those 'professional feminist women' who have spent decades telling lies and worshipping the false dogma of feminist, blaming everything on men and the 'patriarchy'.

Thirdly, the idea that women should be 50% of every job (I notice the feminists only yearn for the good jobs, not working with sewerage for example) and 50% of every level of every job is a lie. Men and women are not the same and not equal in their aptitudes and abilities. The evidence is there in our brains and in evolution, in history and in all cultures. Men excel at some things; women have evolved to try and get the best man they can and to have babies and look after them. In IQ terms, women tend to be very middling; men massivley dominate the higher levels of IQ - and so it is natural and right that they dominate the higher levels of every profession, whcih they do. In fact, it is men who suffer far more sexism these days - passed over for promotion so a mediuocre woamn can leapfrog into a promotion (Look at councils, the BBC etc). And the assumption that men get any unfair advantage is nonsense and offensive: men achieve because they have talent and work their guts out to develop it in an obsessive way. Women are not in general made like that.

Fourthly, in a country where men are massivley discriminated against in law, where fathers have practically no rights over their children, where most of women's money is earned by men and goes to women through unfair divorce settlements, where women get 7 time more health spending than men, where women get far more from the welfare state in benefits and earlt retirement, where politicans - even though mostly male - NEVER defend men or stand up for their rights, where TV and media is massivley misandrist portrayimng men as buffons or monsters, where all men are seen as guilty paedos unless they constantly express and prove their innocence, where the education system in massivley sexist against boys and rigged against them - and male teachers - I think it is extremely rich and lpathetic for the usual moaning minnie feminist brigade to engage in envy and sour grapes - agains spreading the lie that men supposedly get an unfair advantage in poiltics or elsewhere.

And as usual, the feminists hate women who are not like them even more than men. Why should a woman not put her family over her career? We in the UK have the highest divorce rate, the high single parent family rate, and the unhappiest most messed up kids in europe. Some would say that is cause by US-style feminism which the UK just apes. By the way, feminists in France would be happy with the idea of putting familt and children first - it's just the hairy armpit brigade in the US and its femi-poodle the UK that are anti-men and anti-family.""",1425934349,

Modern Western culture (Europe, North America and Australia) subdivides the male population according to sexual preference -- namely, what type of body they prefer to have in a sex partner.  Even the term *homosexual* originally referred only to the distribution of physical sexes in a group, or engaged in a particular sexual activity, so if everyone involved was the same sex, it was a homosexual group or activity, and if there were different sexes, it was a heterosexual group or activity.  Acts and groups could thus be homo/hetero sexual, but it would have been as absurd to call a single person ""homosexual"" as to call that person, say, ""intergenerational"".

The X'tians have always tried to refute carbon dating, but to date I have yet to read any plausible information presented by them in a scientific manner (paper/journal) that supports their very weak claim.

When you think about it we mark our time for our clocks by counting radioactive decay (cesium) there is some support on our side for carbon dating. And since everything is radioactive to some degree and decays I'd say we are on firm ground. Even the hand rolled cigarettes I smoke are radio active. Isotopes under the ground produce radioactive gasses that some of us worry about in our homes, but eventually it decays. 

Medical science uses isotopes to produce pictures of systems within the body, and do so knowing that their short half life is generally safe for living beings. They also attach these isotopes to chemicals so they can be tracked to their 'receptor' sites.

The US Ounce is strictly 30g, however, the Imperial Ounce is strictly 28g. 

The street drug trade both in the US and in Europe, parts of  Australia and NZ (wouldn't know about the rest of the world), the Standard Imperial Ounce is most commonly used as the measurement of weight used to measure cannabis transactions which fall below a kilo.

Pounds are rare (due to the kilo rate) although not unheard of. In the UK, 9 Bars are common measurement for small time dealers and some heavy users to trade in. One 9Bar is 9 ounces.

Most users will buy an ounce or less depending on their usage, or if they have friends who will buy from them. Subdivisions below an ounce are measured as fractions of an ounce. Halves, Quarters, Eights and occasionally Sixteenths.

And many people who use drugs at an early age never thought they'd need to know fractions. That's what you call applied learning.

Pretty much every other drug market aside from the cannabis trade either works in grams or simple doses. (eg. Ecstasy and other pill based drugs) 

LSD is measured in micrograms or µg's however, only the manufacturers of a batch of LSD will really know the true µg weight of the LSD contained in a microdot or blotter LSD hit.

I'm not sure why the cannabis trade is the exception to the metric rule, however I have heard fictional accounts of drug trading where cocaine or amphetamines have been referred to in pounds (Lbs) although it is clear that the common measurement of usage (even in the USA) is the kilo for both of these drugs.

I disagree with this as motivation, although it's a very convenient side-effect, to be sure.  Marx saw religion as one of the many ways that the upper class controlled the workers.  In his time religious conviction among the working poor in Europe was quite well established, and the Church, wealthy and entrenched as it was, preached servitude and accepting one's place in society (e.g. Titus 2:9, ""Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again"").

This certainly has some historical precedent in Europe in particular and isn't particularly surprising.

It's also interesting to note that Marx's 1843 work, *Zur Kritik der Hegelschen Rechtsphilosophie*, which is the source for most of his views on religion, is not related to communism specifically but is rather a point-by-point philosophical critique of an 1820 work by the philosopher Hegel, *Grundlinien der Philosophie des Rechts*.  Furthermore, this work was not published in Marx's lifetime, but only posthumously.  It is here that Marx notes: 

&gt; *Die Religion ist der Seufzer der bedrängten Kreatur, das Gemüt einer herzlosen Welt, wie sie der Geist geistloser Zustände ist. Sie ist das Opium des Volkes.*

... which is oft-quoted.

I think that Marx's atheism was taken further by Lenin and it is from his interpretation that the modern notion of atheist communism derives. In his 1909 work, *Об отношении рабочей партии к религии*, he elaborates on the above, noting:

&gt;*Религия есть опиум народа, - это изречение Маркса есть краеугольный камень всего миросозерцания марксизма в вопросе о религии. Все современные религии и церкви, все и всяческие религиозные организации марксизм рассматривает всегда, как органы буржуазной реакции, служащие защите эксплуатации и одурманению рабочего класса.*

This view was echoed by later Russian communists and is hardly surprising given the incredible influence the Russian Orthodox church had had on Russian society before the revolution.  Even so, the persecution of the church in the USSR was haphazard and in many ways religion remained entrenched.

I guess what I'm  mainly saying is that the communist take on religion is more complex than just removing competition.

The boom under Blair was different, in that it largely resulted in a greater spread of full employment across more varied sectors and closer ties with Europe and the US.

If the UK had joined the single European currency, as pro-Europe Tories like Ken Clarke had advocated, the EU would have sheltered the UK taxpayer from the majority of the bail-out burden and the collapse in the US economy wouldn't have impacted us as hard as it has.

So, if anything, it's the projectionists who've exposed the UK banks to greater risk, not New Labour polices, per-se.

If you have money and a good degree studies in the US are accessible, otherwise things get a little tricky. I got lucky and was able to join a scholarship program, but that has some setbacks (more later).

Your visa is step 571 in a 3451-step process :) First you need to take the SAT/GRE and language tests and whatnot. Then you need to apply to the universities. Then you need to be admitted to a US university that will act as a sponsoring school.

Just a couple of things from my experience:

- US undergraduate studies are not necessarily on par with comparable programs in other countries. US graduate schools on the other hand are great. If you have a degree go straight to grad school in the US. It might be worth an extra year to complete your degree in your home country. Don't waste your time and money on undergrad studies in the US.

- the visa application process is a bitch. You need tons of papers and you have to submit them in the right order.

- Money is a major issue. Unless you are lucky enough to be accepted for a Ph.D. position, be prepared to spend a lot of money on your studies.

- If your home country pays for your studies the ""2 year rule"" prevents you from working in the US during two years.

- US citizenship is still many many years away.

- Exchange programs are the easiest way in. Go for a degree in your home country and study in the US. You won't get a US degree, however, if you are bright, work hard and get to know the professors, you will be asked to consider a Ph.D. A master's degree is not a straight ticket to the US; you still have to work hard to get a H-1B visa, but a Ph.D. opens many doors.

I have worked (Bartender, Server, Assistant Manager, and Controller) in high end restaurants in NYC and Philadelphia. 

I wish to address your questions. 

&gt;I shouldn't be directly in charge of the waiter's wage. If I wanted to do that I'd just establish or buy a restaurant of my own. As a paying customer I would expect the restaurant owner to take care of his employees as well as the preparation of my food. Luckily I can vote with my wallet.

Then don't eat at restaurants in the US. From my experience as a controller I can ensure you that profits are tight even in the best of times. Food costs are hard to meet even in the best of times. Given the economic climate now they are even more difficult. If prices were raised to account for the increase in salaries of the staff the price of a meal would jump considerably. Servers make on average $2.13 an hour in the US and that goes towards taxes automatically. Bartenders get more ranging from $7 to $10 an hour depending on experience and skill. So the bulk of a severing staff's pay comes from tips which are taxed. Servers are legally obligated to claim 100% of the tips that they make which is taxed. 

&gt;I shouldn't have to give a judgment of the waiter's performance directly in terms of money based on one show and a number of factors out of his control. If I have a bad day, or the food is bad, or I have to wait just because the owner has staffed too sparingly for the evening will probably ruin the evening for me but I can't really tell how much more the waiter could have done. Having to keep measuring the waiter's performance is pretty hard but OTOH picking up exceptionally good performance is rather easy as it will stand out by definition.

Those are factors which a good server will smooth over. I have turned people from being miserable and having a bad day into happy people, it’s rather easy. I have also been in situations where we were grossly understaffed and I have paid attention to detail and ensured that my guests did not want for anything. It’s all about the quality of the staff. To address the fact that a server is not in control of the food is wrong. A good server will refuse to bring sub par product to a table. I have refused food that was not up to standards, mind you I have never worked at a TGI Friday's or some lower to mid-range places that may not allow for the discretion of the server. Moreover, if you feel that you should not be the judge of someone’s performance then do not eat at restaurants in the US because that is how business is conducted. 

&gt;Tipping effectively avoids paying wages without them being subjected to income tax and thus adds to the government's pressure to raise more taxes on things that actually can be taxed.

No that is wrong, as previously mentioned servers are legally obligated to claim 100% of their tips. 

&gt;Customary tipping is based on the total bill; why not just add the same dang amount to the bill itself and pay the waiter the proper salary in the first place! Then again, optionally tipping for exceptionally good service is more of a subjective issue and I can just follow my heart on how much extra I want to give to my waiter. This gets rid of the insanity of tipping him differently for pouring a bottle of x dollar wine versus 10x dollar wine.

Every computer system I have used has allowed for whatever percentage you want allocated as a tip to be added to bills. You can ask for this to be done. In my experience some people tip on wine some don't. That again would be at the guest’s discretion.

&gt;While tipping should supposedly keep the waiters more focused on serving you well, it also keeps the customers on their toes. You can react in only two ways to being expected to pay tip for mediocre or bad service: suppress your frustration or be forced to confront the issue. The latter probably spoils the fun for the evening. I can still have fun despite of bad service but I don't want to explicitly reward it.

Sup par service would result in a sub par tip. If you have a bad experience then leave a bad tip, no need for a confrontation.

&gt;Tipping blurs the total price of the food and service. It's hard to compare the price and quality of one restaurant to the restaurant next door if there are such variables in the total cost. This is of course less of a problem if eating out in your city or country is inexpensive anyway.

No it doesn't, you are totally wrong. I can see that being the case if you compare the US to the EU but not within the US. 

&gt;Well-tipping people are probably fought over by waiters upon arrival. Their income shouldn't depend on which of them fights to get the known good customers.

Again no, good customers request certain servers, no fight; servers establish and maintain relationships with good guests.

I hope this address you questions. In short if you do not like how restaurant conduct themselves in the US please don't go to them. We don't want people in them that don't know how to tip. *Or those that feel morally obligated not to tip*

Interesting, Wikipedia mentions two cases where stagflation occurs:

&gt;Economists offer two principal explanations for why stagflation occurs. First, stagflation can result when an economy is slowed by an unfavorable supply shock, such as an increase in the price of oil in an oil importing country, which tends to raise prices at the same time that it slows the economy by making production less profitable.[5][6][7] This type of stagflation presents a policy dilemma because most actions to assist with fighting inflation worsen economic stagnation and vice versa. **Second, both stagnation and inflation can result from inappropriate macroeconomic policies.**

(emphasis mine)

&gt;John Maynard Keynes wrote in The Economic Consequences of the Peace that governments printing money and using price controls were causing a combination of inflation and economic stagnation in Europe after World War I. Stagflation was, as stated above, also a very serious macroeconomic problem in the 1970s.

**European Union Commons International Development Committee**

They said: “Rates of malnutrition in Gaza and parts of the West Bank are as bad as anything one would find in sub-Saharan Africa. The Palestinian economy has all but collapsed. Unemployment rates are in the region of 60 to 70 per cent. “The EU should not shy away from using economic pressure to gain political leverage with Israel.”

The report said that Palestinian farmers had land confiscated, crops damaged and were “plagued” by problems in getting goods to market.
MPs condemned the Israeli government for preventing the free export of goods from the West Bank and Gaza, and urged the EU to suspend Israel’s preferential tariff rates until they allow Palestinians free access to European markets. They said: “It is hard to avoid the conclusion that there is a deliberate Israeli strategy of putting the lives of ordinary Palestinians under stress as part of a strategy to bring the population under heel.

The report said movement restrictions on the Palestinians were justified by Israel as security measures, but warned that “in reality they have been a mechanism to put pressure on the Palestinians by crippling the economy”.

My take on the current situation. 
A rather calmer repost from another thread. 

Israel is the regional power. It is the big mean dog, it has all that it wants, the land, military dominance over all its neighbours, trade, the coverage of the worlds only super power. Israel wants peace as it is comfortable. Israel wants to maintain the current status quo as is. Israel wants to impose its will calling it ""peace"" on a defeated people. Those who rule always want that kind of peace.

I dont expect you to agree with the Palestinian POV but at least to understand it.

Palestinians do not place the same premium on peace the Israelis do. They have very little. They have issues that need addressing, the right of return, the occupation of the West Bank, the annexation of Jerusalem, the economic shut down, the total control and blockade of their areas. They see peace as surrender. This is why they keep firing rockets. They want justice. The ruled always do.

To get Peace the Israelis have to address issues they do not want to. Until Israel is prepared to do that, there will not be peace. Without justice there will be no peace

It can be done, like I said above, the UK showed the way when it talked to the IRA with no pre-condtions. No, ""edit the United Ireland part of your charter"" before we talk. The commander of the Londonderry IRA is now a UK member of parliament and Northern Ireland is still a part of the UK. By talking to the extremists, you fractionalise them, those that want peace, and those that want to fight. To strengthen the hand of those that want peace serious concessions have to be made, when those that want to derail the peace talks strike with rocket attacks and car bombs you have to be very careful with retaliation. Its a long slow road, but there was a time when Northern Ireland looked as hopeless as Palestine, but look at it now.

The PLO was willing to change its charter and recognize Israel, didn't get them anywhere...

The solution to the problems obvious. All the peace plans are essentially the same. Clinton's Peace Plan, the Nusseiba-Ayalon Plan, the Saudi Peace Initiative, Bush’s Road Map, Oslo, Taba summit are all pretty similar

They all include clear measures that Israel has to take in order to make peace:

1.Dismantle the settlements,

2.Withdraw its soldiers and civilians from the occupied territories,

3.Create a viable Palestinian state,

4.find a solution for the Palestinian refugees' right of return.

5.Find a way to guarantee Israeli security. Altho' I believe having nuke addresses that.

6.A creative way to reward Israel for giving up what it feels it has won in war. $3B pa?

The problem is Israel refuses to go along with these plans. At some point, there will be an ""event"" and the talks will fail. developing new plans is a waste of time. Israel wants Land, specifically the West Bank. Israel has not dismantled a single settlement built there, and has never ceased to take Palestinian lands under the guise of security. This is the underlying tactic. The aim is to create a ""reality on the ground"" where it become impossible to uproot 100,000's of settlers. The palestininans will become a servant population within this greater Israel ruled by a compliant Palistinian authority. FATAH under Abbas fits this bill.

To end here a great quote from 1938. George Antonius

""The treatment meted out to Jews in Germany and other European countries is a disgrace to its authors and to modern civilisation. Posterity will not exonerate in any country that fails to bear its proper share of the sacrifices needed to alleviate Jewish suffering and distress. To place the brunt of the burden upon Arab Palestineis a miserable evasion of the duty that lies upon the whole of the civilised world. It is also morally outrageous. No code of morals could justify the persecution of one people in an attempt to relieve the persecution of another. The cure for the eviction of Jews from Germany is not to be sought in the eviction of the Arabs from their homeland and the relief of Jewish distress must not be accomplished at the cost of inflicting a corresponding distress upon an innocent and peaceful population"".

""It is derived from a Proto-Indo-European root *man- (cf. Sanskrit/Avestan manu-, Czech muž ""man, male"").[1] In Hindu mythology, Manu is a title accorded the progenitor of humankind. Sometimes, the word is connected with the root *men- ""to think"" (cognate to mind). Restricted use in the sense ""adult male"" only began to occur in late Old English, around 1000 AD, and the word formerly expressing male sex, wer had died out by 1300 (but survives in e.g. were-wolf and were-gild). The original sense of the word is preserved in mankind, from Old English mancynn.

In Old English the words wer and wīf (also wǣpmann and wīfmann) were used to refer to ""a man"" and ""a woman"" respectively, while mann was gender neutral. In Middle English man displaced wer as the term for ""male human,"" whilst wyfman (which eventually evolved into woman) was retained for ""female human"". Man does continue to carry its original sense of ""human"" however, resulting in an asymmetry sometimes criticized as sexist. [2]""

The last part where it starts to get tweaked when it gets brought over to Middle English is an interesting one. I would venture a guess as it has a lot to do with the intertwining of the church with the English government. Eve was made from Adam, thus she is part of man, so the female prefix gets tacked on to ""man"" since man is seen as the root of things.

However, in today's usage I really don't think you get this same connotation. We've moved away from the church as a whole so while the word hasn't changed, the inferred superiority of the term I think has. English is a funny language, especially the version we speak in America. I think today it is viewed much more as the root of the word ""human"" so while it is technically a male gendered word, it isn't used that way. I really don't see the point in getting upset about an arrangement of letters.",1425934542,

Xmas (by which I mean the basically secular holiday most people in the UK celebrate) is subverting Christmas for it's own capitalistic ends. Christianity replaced Saturnian(sic?) and [Yule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yule) and the various other pagan festivals in europe,

When a new ideology tries to replace an existing one it typically tries to subvert and claim ownership of the existing one's festivals and traditions.

The conflict between Xmas and the Pagan Yule can be seen most clearly in the pages of the bible, before subverting the ideas of Pagan festivals the bible codemned it:

Jeremiah 10

*10:2 Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.*	
*10:3 For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.
*10:4 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.*

Please understand I'm not being critical of Christianity at all with this post. It's just the natural process by which new belief systems replace the previous ones. I just personally think that once you understand that Christianity is just the current clothes that this pre-historic festival wears then it makes it human and wonderful.

I'm going to get downvoted into the cellar for saying so, but Christmas *is* a celebration of Jesus' birth -- or at least *was*.  Yes, it was relocated on the calendar to give converted pagans something orthodox to celebrate during what would otherwise have been their winter solstice celebration, but that does *not* mean that Christmas is just a solstice celebration dressed up in Catholic vestment.  The fact of the matter is that it was celebrated for the greater part of 2,000 years as a commemoration of the birth of what most Europeans regarded as the Son of God.  You're welcome to celebrate anything (or nothing) you want during that season, but be advised that if you say that you celebrate Christmas some people will assume you mean to imply the specifically Christian associations, and it won't be entirely unreasonable for them to do so.

b) Even taking the phrase in its loosest sense, saying that Christmas ""was originally a celebration of winter festivals"" doesn't mean that those festivals were originally secular.  They weren't.  They were associated with the agricultural cycle, but in most agricultural societies it was a religious observance to mark that cycle with feasts and celebrations.  It's virtually impossible to find a historical instance of a secular festival celebrating that cycle prior to the Enlightenment, and even then it was a pretty obvious adaptation of religious festivals.  That's particularly obvious when you think about what those ceremonies involved.  The Christmas tree, the Yule log and the May pole are all relics of pagan nature worship.  Winter festivals commemorated the death of the new year and its rebirth or resurrection in the spring -- ie. the divine renewal of the consecrated world.  And so on, and so forth.

On marriage law,

&gt;As far as the marriage law, it says in your link that palestinians cannot gain Israeli citizenship by marrying an Israeli Arab. It does not say an Israeli Arab must leave Israel after doing so.

From the link I provided, the bold is my work:
&gt;The law stipulates that the interior minister does not have the authority to approve residence in Israel for a resident of Judea and Samaria (**unless, of course, they are Jews** - that is, settlers). This is so even regarding family reunions, meaning marriage, when it comes to Palestinian spouses who are younger than 35 (for men) or 25 (for women). In effect, **the law prevents young Israeli citizens from marrying the spouse of their choice and living with this spouse in Israel, if the spouse is a Palestinian from Judea and Samaria.**


Whether a paper is liberal is a 'neither-here-nor-there' straw man.  I'm hardly going to be reading about Israel's blatant apartheid in a right-wing publication am I?  Of course, we should look to see if there are some other corroborating sources -  Israeli and internationally impartial if possible.

•""The draft law barring family reunification for Palestinian spouses of Israeli citizens is profoundly discriminatory...This bill blatantly discriminates against Israelis of Palestinian origin and their Palestinian spouses"" - *Human Rights Watch*

•""A law permitting such blatant racial discrimination, on grounds of ethnicity or nationality, would clearly violate international human rights law and treaties which Israel has ratified and pledged to uphold."" - *Amnesty International*

•""This is a racist law that decides who can live here according to racist criteria."" - *Israeli humanitarian group B'Tselem*

and how about something from a more personal perspective?

•[""Today I lost hope,""](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-imposes-racist-marriage-law-588637.html) Sa'id abu Muammar, an Israeli Arab, told Reuters news agency. He has been hiding his Palestinian wife from the police since their marriage a year ago. ""This is what we've been doing and this is probably what we will have to continue to do.""

That you want to go on to semantics when there is a matter of institutionalised racism and claim it isn't apartheid because they're not European.  Well, *shame on you*.  Unfortunately for you even your semantic argument is going to fall flat on its racist face.  When the South African crime of apartheid was identified it, apartheid, then went on to be defined by international law to help prevent others from doing the same elsewhere.

Ready? 
        Article 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court 

&gt;[The **'crime of apartheid'** means inhumane acts of a character similar to those referred to in paragraph 1, committed in the context of an institutionalised regime of systematic oppression and domination by one racial group over any other racial group or groups and committed with the intention of maintaining that regime.](http://untreaty.un.org/cod/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm)

You keep saying that, but speaking as one who has, at times, had to rely on public transit, I don't see it. Buses are inferior mass transit, period. They're cheap and easy to implement, but that's not really much of an advantage for the *riders*. It is only an advantage for teh city planners.

It is cheaper on a per capita spending because France has a single payer policy, while we negotiate through many ""middle men"". However, given that Europe's population is gradually getting older while there are less and less capable and skilled workers in the work force, health care costs are rapidly skyrocketing. Countries like France are accumulating massive amounts of debt.

The point is... When the costs skyrocket, the money must come from somewhere to get high quality health care products and services. Either you pay for it or have everyone pay for it through taxes.

There lies the big issue, skyrocketing health care costs and pressure to raise taxes to support those costs. You seem to have missed the entire point on the economical issue.

In the real world, money do not grow on trees. Think carefully before you spout such foolish, nonsensical and idealistic rhetoric as, ""I don't know about you, but I'm not willing to let people die in order to add some value to your biotech company's stock.""

People die all over the world. If no one died from economic scarcity, we'd all be in heaven. There is no fine definition of a universal morality in this world.

Think carefully... The current systems of socialized medicine are the reason I'm making money, yet I'm professing that they are severely flawed systems.

Something to get you started:
One of the problems for Sweden's high unemployment among younger citizens is to simply lower the minimum wage, but they refuse to do so. The question every economist asks is, why?

2. Yes, took plenty of econ courses in college. A's in all of them. That's where I learned how MW increases actually function on the economy, it's not as simplistic as  you're trying to bluff your way through portraying. And my finance classes were about accounting and business admin, I have no idea why minimum wage would come up in a finance class.

3. I did not bring up something unrelated. You said the minimum wage causes unemployment. It does not, it causes layoffs from some low value positions when minimum wage positions occur. Layoffs are NOT unemployment. You're incorrectly identifying them as the same thing. 

Layoffs only turn into unemployment if other jobs are not created or vacated by other workers. When you raise the minimum wage, the added value of the 3rd or 4th job for a family goes down and some leave these 3rd and 4th jobs (depending on the size of the raise). Additionally, MW increases also stimulate the economy, creating jobs at places the lowest paid workers consume.

For certain thresholds of minimum wage, these levels cause many vacant jobs upon a raise. Only if the number of people dropping extra jobs is less than the number of people being laid off from low value positions does unemployment actually go up.

Yes, my description of unemployment didn't distinguish between U-6 (counts those who have stopped looking) and U-3 (does not count those who have stopped looking. So what. The effect is the same on both. You're the one bringing up tangentially related material now.

And sweden will not solve its unemployment issue by merely lowering MW. Most of the northern countries of Europe have stringent regulations on layoffs and firings that make ANY hire risky. Most people cite those as the issue.",1425935245,

Atat eBay si PayPal, cat si vanzatorul au confirmat efectuare platii pentru produlsul cumparat, respectiv primirea banilor de catre vanzator, (detin ca proba mesajele de confirmare).
Problema este ca desi s-a achitat la 17.02.2009 nici pana in prezent nu am primit produsul platit.
Ultimul mesaj primit de la vanzator, ma informa ca intre timp nu mai vinde produsul si ca urmeaza sa returneze banii in contul intermediarului care a platit pentru mine. Insa a trecut si dara de 09.03.2009, data la care vanzatorul a promis ca va returna banii.
Intre timp (impreuna cu intermediarul care a platit pentru mine), am sesizat pe cei de la PayPal rugandu-i sa intervina pentru a-mi recupera prejudiciul insa, acestia din urma s-au dovedit refractari in a-mi rezolva problema.
Ba mai mult, PayPal refuza sa-mi transmita adresa si datele personale ale infractorului, astfel ca eu sa pot sesiza autoritatile competente din Marea Britanie, in scopul recuperarii prejudiciului.
Consider ca PayPal, dupa ce si-a dobandit comisionul din aceasta tranzactie, acum nu face de cat sa protejeze infractorul, asociindu-se cu infractorul la savarsirea infractiunii de inselaciune si furt in forma calificata.

Ok here goes!

1. I don't believe in 100% equality between the sexes. Partly because I am constantly reading how men who beat women are scum. Violence is violence, it shouldn't matter if you beat up a woman, gay man, black man or whatever. 

As a young, white, straight, man I find it incredibly frustrating that I got beaten up a few years back and the police dropped the case almost instantly even when I pointed out the group they belonged to (they had hung around to gloat while the 2 guys had scarpered).

I also find feminism to be flawed, men and women compete seperately in the olympics because if they were to compete together, the majority of the sports would be dominated by men. Before I am labeled a dick, I feel that we should encourage our differences, we aren't the same and I like that. I do agree that if men and women do 100% identical jobs then they should get paid the same but is it ever that black and white? Ok so in Scotland the gap is something ridiculous like 20% but it's not just about how you do your job but what you bring to the workplace as well. In a retail job I was constantly picked out to do the shit jobs like litterpick, collect the discarded carts from the car pack, no matter the weather it was always a guy chosen. I found that to be sexist, how can they preach about equality?

-2. I don't think we should donate any money to 3rd world countries, not until we live in a Utopia with excess everything. We have poor people here and crime and shortages of jobs, why should we throw money to them? 

We all started at the same point, if anything the African nations had a headstart since we first evolved from there. 

If they chose to run around in tribes and fight each other then that's their choices, Europeans became civilised and built up their nations.

It’s got a good bit of turbo lag, so you need to keep the revs up for serious power, but once the turbo kicks in, acceleration is frisky. And the lag makes the car feel faster than it actually is. I didn’t wring it out, but over the course of a short cruise through the suburbs, it felt like a car I could gladly live with day in, day out. Fun to drive, just enough room for a family, and frugal as all get out. In Europe, the Polo sells for less than $20,000 
&gt;
&gt;VW isn’t promising to bring these cars to the U.S. market, but the ones I drove are in this country for a reason, and that reason has much to do with seeing how they fare in the arduous environmental and safety testing demanded by the feds.

Those go and help them. Those just want to force others to help them are hypocrites - and this is what it all is about, isn't it? Help should not be just something dumped on an atomistic person but something inseparable from community life because only in community life, observing each other's lifestyles, can we decide who deserves help and how much. When it's administered bureaucratically, it's always based on need and never on what's deserved, therefore, by definition, unjust. That these days the communities don't work as well as they used to be is that liberal policies killed community life, turned it into some sort of an unserious ""hanging out with people"". Before that, it was dead serious, because the welfare state didn't exist and anti-discrimination laws didn't exist, so you HAD TO comply with the rules and lifestyle of your community to survive. Thus, help was inseparable from social bonding, social interaction, community life.

So, the problem is not the desire to help others but such an extremely individualistic, asocial, acommunitarian way to do it, when there is nothing else but a bureacracy and an individual, and individual isn't even judged, just his need recognized.

&gt;""In the West, we live in societies based in some part upon the ideas of the Enlightenment. The United States was created through the use of liberal, Enlightenment thought combined with traditional visions of Republicanism. This indicates that it is relevant to political philosophy, because the ideas are at the heart of Western democracy.""

It's a bit more complicated than that. First, the US is different than Europe (and I've never been in the US but know it fairly well from books). 

Much of the European political culture was based on Enlightenment values (basically, the French Revolution), and this is why we have all sorts of problems, such as falling birthrates which always reflect the falling ""will to live"", ""lifeforce"", basically, the diminishing mental health of a community. 

America is a bit different. Much of it is based on Ancient Roman stuff, Cicero, Cato... I think this is what you mean by traditional Republicanism. This was largely channeled by the Anglo-Scottish Enlightenment, which isn't Enlightenment, it's a rediscovery of old values, unlike the French one, which is pure BS ideology.

Another point is that the American Revolution happened earlier than the European ones and thus preserved more of the old values, it was way less ""gnostic"", ""utopian"", much more practical than f.e. the French one. Unlike Rousseau, Voltaire, and Roberspierre, James Madison wasn't quite a narrow-minded ideologue, he strikes me as a wise, prudent man whom Cicero or Marcus Aurelius would have liked much. This is why America has more ""lifeforce"", more pride, more patriotism, although it's rapidly diminishing there too.

&gt;""Negative and positive liberty are used to define just how complex humans are""

How? The problem with rights that they are rooted in a definition of an atomistic individual unrelated to society. Such individuals don't exist - what we are is largely the content of our minds and it's a product of our families, communities etc. both in a genetic and in a cultural sense. 

Negative rights are fairly useful, but defined wrongly, as they are defined as the claims of an atomistic individual against an impersonal world. They should be turned into duties: instead of a right to life, a duty not to kill i.e. moral rules that regulate community life, not a claim upon an impersonal world, that's to dehumanized.

Positive rights are problematic, because they do not take real justice into account: people should get what they deserve. Justice isn't the only value, of course, mercy and compassion are values too: sometimes we give more to people than what they deserve and that's a good thing, as we have hearts, not just minds. 

However, there is always a prudent, practical mixture how justice (get what you deserve) and mercy (get better than you deserve) should be mixed and the correct mixture cannot be based on abstract rules but discovered by a case-by-basis, by a kind of evolution of practices in actual community life. 

&gt;""Isn't the ""State of Nature"" a rather abstract model?""

More like a fairly accurate description of stone age tribal societies, both prehistorical and contemporary (pygmy f.e.). 

Granted, his description is a tad bit sensationalist, they are actually more moral than that. Hell, even primates (bonobos) are more moral than what Hobbes thought of the State of Nature. 

Anyway, the point is that it's based on reality, although on quite a bit misunderstood reality, not on a model.

It does not matter much though, as the important point is not what happens in a State of Nature, but in a State of Society...",1425935366,

""Too many cooks spoiled the broth!"" Your ""official commitee sounding reply"" gives you away as not a single person but as a group scrambling to put out an unforeseen forest fire.

I am not a committee of anything. I am quite a real person, and these are my own opinions. I am neither getting paid or encouraged by anyone, nor do I get a list of talking points from anywhere. 

But, let's get back on track. I asked you specific questions: DID YOU KNOW about these things I mentioned? If you did not, you have no right to an opinion. It is a fact that palestinians have created this conflict and prolonged it, doing everything they could to prevent its resolution. Yes, Israel is exploiting it in every way, but it was the palestinians who started and sustained it. If you lack the insight and access to sources of information, that's your problem.

&gt; Problem 1: The majority of the countries of the world hate you

You wishing that to be so does not make it so. Vocal european left supported by masses of muslim immigrants does not equal ""majority of the countries of the world."" Majority of the countries of the world rely on our expertise and technology in many critical fields.

&gt; and you exist off the influx of petro-dollars from the U.S.

That is also a delusion. Israel doesn't keep this money. It flows directly back to US, creating american jobs. In return, we get wonderful treats like outdated AR15 rifles and equipment from the Vietnam war.

&gt; Problem 2: The U.S. is crashing economically and may not be able to give you billions in economic support much longer.

And that is going to be a good thing for us. First, it will remove an undesired entanglement between american financial markets and Israel, and will allow politicians to create conditions in which massive jewish capital moves into Israel back from USA. Second, it will release us from informal obligations before US, allowing us effective freedom to act, which will *most certainly* result in a nasty, bloody and successful elimination of all traces of palestinian ""resistance"". I personally can't wait till it happens.

&gt; Problem 3: Iran may have ""the bomb"" very soon which will negate the fact that you already have 300 nukes of various ""megaton size"". You are outside the brotherhood of nations, being the only nation in the world to have nuclear weapons and yet inconceivably deny having them!

You do not understand the war doctrines surrounding nuclear weapons. Here's something to shock you: I consider the traitor Mordechai Vanunu one of the greatest contributors to zionism. If you do not understand why this is so, maybe you should limit your opinions to places *you* live in.

&gt; Problem 4: Do you attack Natanz without US support?

What?

&gt; Netanyahu has a critical decision to make! Risk WWIII by attacking, OR, maybe, you started it, you die, as America does not follow you down the hole and Iran (no pushover militarily) defeats your initial air attack.

Dream on. 

&gt; ....You attack, hoping the US supports you anyway! Not gonna happen now that Bush and Cheney are gone!

So far, Obama has been a *way* better friend to Israel and zionism than Bush and Cheney - and he hasn't even done anything yet. If you think Obama is going to be subverted by the antizionist mood of european left, you are sorely mistaken. Certainly, Obama is smarter and better educated than any of you, and it is no surprise that he understands right from wrong better than an average armchair reddit advocate of palestinian rights.

&gt; You just might have to negotiate Israel.

Negotiate what? Return of lands? There will be no return of lands until it is guaranteed that there are no more attacks, and if there *are* more attacks after the palestinian state is created, I guarantee you there *will* be a *real* ethnic cleansing, and the world will swallow it because a) it will be the only thing that can be done and b) no one really gives a shit about the palestinians

&gt; From the rest of the world's point of view, you just evaporated each other in a nuclear exchange.

* You can't imagine how much time you spend looking at your front wheel instead of the landscape, on a standard bike, until you rode a recumbent. Really.

* They're not only comfortable, they're relaxing. Being on a lounge chair rather than a saddle really has an impact on your mood, after a while!

As for riding in traffic: if I must believe bicycling.reddit, US drivers really turn into psychopaths when they see a bike, so I don't know how generalizable a European experience can be, but it's not that bad.

&gt;Most chose Israel as a home and state not because god said so, but because of their historical connection with that land. The UN recognized this in '48.

Most Jews did not choose this land (only a small fraction of Jews lived as a small minority in palestine before WWII) but were forced to go there because no other country accepted them when they were expelled from Europe. In addition, what historical connection with the land do you see other than religious? In fact, the vast majority of European Jews (and possibly the vast majority of all Jews) are not related to the biblical Jews in any geneologic way (and even if they were that would not give them the right to expel the natives after 2000 years...)

Nonsense. In fact Israel was at its height of popularity in the west after the 1967 war. Only when it became clear that it intends to keep the occupation forever and continue its policy of ethnic cleansing and keep the Palestinians eternally without any rights in an apartheid state, Israel's popularity has declined and the real face of a racist and brutal ethnic/religious group has emerged, using its US influence to push its agenda.

&gt;Does Israel's actions come anywhere close to the what I just described?

No, they have not created gas chambers yet but that doesn't mean israel's behavior is acceptable. And thanks for comparing yourself to Rwanda. But how about this? Palestinians are now 3rd generation under occupation, have absolutely no rights, whoever resists the occupation is considered a terrorists, there is a huge aparatus of security forces, collaborators, death squads, killing from the air, collective punishments, hundreds of laws that are all meant to make Palestinians lives unbearable so that they leave. In short, in the occupied territories, the Palestinians live in far worse conditions and much more oppression than blacks did in S. Africa. Yet S. Africa was boycotted by the whole world. The only reason Israel isn't yet is because of the Jewish influence in the United States and the west's lingering guilt trip over the Holocaust.

&gt;historical revisionism suggesting the New Deal and government programs worsened the economy are trivial, at best

Sigh...

In 1920, Woodrow Wilson and FDR were trying to convince Hoover to run as a Democrat.

Instead, he thought it was going to be a ""Republican year"" so he stuck with his party loyalty.  In the 1920s, Hoover revolutionized government intervention in the economy, first as Sec. of Commerce then as president. 

[Wikipedia describes his presidency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Hoover#Policies) as that of a ""A dedicated Progressive and Reformer ... [who] denounced laissez-faire thinking""

The facts of history suggest that the short-sighted interventions of the 1910s &amp; 1920s led to a private-sector debt bubble that wasn't really paid down to reasonable levels until 1933 - four years after the stock market had crashed.  (ie, we are currently one year after the stock crash began and have only *started* paying down/writing off private debt - the necessary ""evil"" of net savings that precipitates a deflationary spiral in a heavily debt-leveraged economy)

In 1933-34, FDR shut down the banks and snagged up the gold for social spending and busy work projects.  Economic output moved up off the new bottom but unemployment stayed in the double-digits until WW2 broke out and all that excess labor went off to die in foreign lands.

The Great Depression is somehow mythologized as a great national triumph, and this is probably only possible because by the true end of it - 1945 - we had physically conquered Western Europe, Northern Africa, and the Pacific region.  No one was having any fun between 1930 and 1945, so I'm hard pressed to see how we call it ""fixed"" in 1933.  

Other than the overwhelming (and incredibly destructive) military victory, it was really a looong series of bad policy and economic mismanagement that screwed the average person for a whole generation.  Those who survived came back as heros and were given the ""American Dream"" of debt-based corporate consumerism, suburban sprawl, and policies designed to always maximize output regardless of environmental and human consequences.",1425935431,

&gt;Mithridates or Mithradates (in Greek, Mιθριδάτης or Mιθράδάτης) is the Hellenistic form of an Iranian theophoric name meaning ""given by Mithra"", being thus a Greek historiographic adaption of Old Iranian *Mithradata-:

&gt;1) First element from Indo-European mitros, Proto-Indo-Iranian *mitras, an Indo-Iranian divinity. Pokorny refined Meillet's mei- as ""to bind."" Combining PIE zero-grade mi- with the ""tool suffix"" -tro- ""that which [causes] ..."" (also found in man-tra-, ""that which causes to think""), then literally means ""that which binds"" and thus ""covenant, treaty, agreement, promise, oath"" etc; cf. Gk. Hom. μίτρη “Gurt; head fascia, Withra”; doubtful μίτος “Einschlagfaden”; Ltv. mìemuri, meimuri “Femerstricke”. Pokorny's interpretation links it with PIE root mei-, ""to fasten, strengthen"", which may be found in Latin moenia ""city wall, fortification"", and in an antonymic form, Old English (ge)maere ""border, boundary-post"".

&gt;2) Second element from participle of dō-, ""give""; compare participle Lat. datus “bestowed” = falisk. datu “given, delivered, given up, surrendered “,vest. data “ been delivered, given up, surrendered “, päl. datas “ been delivered, given up, surrendered"" (: Gk. δοτός); compare also Ind. participle ditá-ḥ (uncovered), secondary dattá-ḥ, zero grade in ā̈-t-tá-ḥ, prá-t-ta-ḥ “devoted”; BUT, ablaut. in tvā-dāta-ḥ “ you gave from"", Av. dāta-. Therefore translated as the general IE zero-grade datós.

&gt;Hence MIE Mitrodátos, ""given by Mitra (promise, oath)"".

Just on Wikipedia, there's a whole research subtitle for Podophilia that states:
&gt;**Relative frequency**

&gt;In order to estimate the relative frequency of fetishes, researchers at the University of Bologna examined 381 Internet discussion groups, in which at least 5,000 people had been participating. Researchers estimated the prevalences of different fetishes based on (a) the number of discussion groups devoted to a particular fetish, (b) the number of individuals participating in the groups and (c) the number of messages exchanged. It was concluded that the most common fetishes were for body parts or for objects usually associated with body parts (33% and 30% respectively). Among those people preferring body parts, feet and toes were preferred by the greatest number, with 47% of those sampled preferring them. Among those people preferring objects related to body parts, footwear (shoes, boots, etc.) was most preferred (64%).[4][5]

&gt;In August 2006, AOL released a database of the search terms submitted by their subscribers. In ranking only those phrases that included the word ""fetish"", it was found that the most common search was for feet.[6]

&gt;**Relationships to health and disease**

&gt;Researchers have hypothesized that foot fetishism increases as a response to epidemics of sexually transmitted diseases. In one study, conducted by Dr. A James Giannini at The Ohio State University [7] an increased interest in feet as sexual objects was observed during the great gonorrhea epidemic of twelfth century Europe, and the syphilis epidemics of the 16th and 19th centuries in Europe. In the same study, the frequency of foot-fetish depictions in pornographic literature was measured over a 30 year interval. An exponential increase was noted during the period of the current AIDS epidemic. In these cases, sexual foot play was viewed as a safe-sex alternative. However, the researchers noted that these epidemics overlapped periods of relative female emancipation. Sexual focus on female feet was also hypothesized to have been a reflection of a more dominant posture of the woman in sexual-social relations. (The first surviving reference of foot fetish is by Bertold of Regensburg in 1220. [8]) [9]",1425935444,

So ""uninstalling"" was impossible, since it would have broken core OS features.  But not since Vista (at the very least).

As for the reasons concerning the changes, I really believe (like some software architects at MS stated before) it makes the OS more manageable.  Windows is a mess of components, most of which are hard to develop because of backwards compatibility and dependencies between components.  If you look at the Windows team at MS, it's divided into smaller groups who each take care of a specific Windows components (or feature set).  The problem with pre-Windows 7 architecture and at a lesser extent Vista, from a developer's perspective, the high number of dependencies between components made developing the next iteration harder and harder.  No group could seriously consider developing a feature on their own without consulting another group to make sure the dependencies are respected and that compatibility is not broken.  That's why a modular OS, where any component can be turned off completely without affecting the others, is the way Microsoft wants to move from now on.

And it helps them face anti-trusts lawsuits easily, since they don't need another version of Windows to accommodate the EU.  They just need to disable some components or features on installation.

I think everybody wins:  MS can come up with a better OS, the users have more control and the lawmakers can spend time on other problems than anti-trust cases.",1425935456,

I think this is a bad analogy. I never took out insurance to protect someone else, I took it out to protect myself. If the government voids my insurance policy, then the injured party will need to sue me in court to prove that I was at fault. If he caused the accident, then I really have nothing to worry about. 

I don't really see a problem here at all. I think you're trying to claim some moral obligation on my part, that I'm someone responsible for his life, but I'm not.

If I drove 100mph and hurt him, then I deserve to have the pants sued off of me and lose everything.

Insurance was merely a way to protect me and hedge my bet. I benefited from insurance, since  I could now drive 100mph if I liked and not worry about consequences. I paid a premium for this, so I had a downside and an upside. It was a hedge. When I lost the insurance, I lost both the upside and the downside.

JK “People, we’re running out of time. Gordon’s toast and the top job will soon be up for grabs.  I have yet to plunge my hands into the wet cement on the walk of political immortality. What am I to do? How will ages yet to come possibly be able to look back on my years as Home Secretary and see the burgeoning greatness that will inevitably sweep me, Jacqueline Jill Smith from the playing fields of Dyson Perrins CofE Sports College (special measures 2008), to the very top of the political tree. Who will rid me of this troublesome air of mediocrity?”

Alan Campbell (for it is he) “Well Minister, the policy wonks down at the Violent Crime Unit at Peel Place have an idea that they’ve been sitting on for a while. It may raise your profile in the right places within the party.”

JK “Oh them,remind me? Oh yes,  forgot about them, haven’t heard much from them since that smoke and mirrors job we did over knife crime. Hmm think we got away with that one, news cycle moved on to bankers and Jade Goody. So spit it out little Al, what have they got.”

AC “It’s a database Minister, you see……”

JK “A what….seriously little Al, are you daft, a bloody database. Here I am up to my chins in boiling poo and you want me to announce another government database. Have you any idea what the papers are going to make of that, let alone that git Old Holborn. Get a grip man. Right now I could really do without another Stasi State story in the Daily Mail“

AC “But Minister, this one is different. This one protects women and children from serial domestic abuse offenders. This one could let the cops pass information about wife beaters all over the country. The idea is, we track the offender everywhere…”

JK “Oh really, why didn’t you say. With a chip? Go on, say there’s a chip. A mind control chip in their heads that stops them doing things…”

AC “No not a chip..”

JK “An ID card then..go on Alan, say it involves making them have ID cards”

AC “Again sadly no Minister. As you know , despite your express wishes, the ID card does not  have a chip with a tracking mechanism.  Not yet anyway.”


JK “Well  how does it work then. How will this database help anybody?”

AC “Well we make them register their address and stuff like sex offenders“

JK “Yeeeessss….and“

AC “Then wherever they go, we tell the Police and the Social Services. They watch them like hawks looking for any sign of them starting a new relationship. Every time they get an new boyfriend or girlfriend, we send a Social Worker to ask the new love interest if they really wants to be partnered up with a violent maniac. The wonks think it would work really well by ensuring that nobody who raises there hand against a significant other ever gets a chance to have a relationship that we don’t know about ever again.”

JK “So it works by……. Oh, I see.“

AC “That’s right Minister. It works by using lots of cops to carry out covert surveillance of people who might commit a crime at some point. They watch, like hawks, like I said, day and night, night and day until the violent offender begins to pitch woo. Then we interpose a Social Worker between the happy couple and try and make sure that she drops him like a hot brick.”

JK “No seriously little Al, very funny but what did they actually say“

AC “No Minister, that is the big idea. Trust me on this it will play well with the Third Sector and the Parliamentary Party will see you as big on crime and really, can you think of a less sympathetic target than wife beaters. If you want another thin wedge end, they are it. Pedo’s, Terrorists, Smokers, Wife Beaters, just need to work out whether we have time to have a pop at carnivores, drinkers and the self employed before the election.“

JK “Well it’s not as if it will ever happen anyway, but it makes the right noises I suppose. Get me the relevant A.C.P.O. bod on the line two. Tell you what, whilst we are at it, lets graft in a bit of forced marriage, genital mutilation, honour based crime and sinister Eastern European pimps. That should cut some ground from under the BNP and the Tories.”

So that makes it alright then? When the Regulation of Investigatory Powers bill was passed into law, many people kept recycling those same old catch-phrases of complacency: ""if you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear"", and ""the security forces need these powers so they can go after terrorists and organised criminals."" My problem with the RIP Act was that (although I realised it would be used for its stated purpose) governments and police forces always take more power than they say they are going to. It's the thin end of the wedge.

About now, we seem to be at the thick end of the RIP Act wedge. The abuses are well-documented, but the summary is this: it is not used exclusively by the police and security forces to monitor terrorists. It's used by town halls and minor officialdom up and down the land to pry into people's private lives for the most trivial reasons. Sure, it's not fascism yet, but neither was fascism.

Why does a government with honest intentions need to lock people up without trial? Why do they need to be able to arrest people for any reason they like? Why have they banned demonstrations near parliament? Why do they need to monitor everyone, all the time? Why the massive databases they are building to record every detail of our lives? Why are they ignoring the decision of the European courts that the DNA database is, in some important respects, illegal? In what way do these actions represent a government we can or should trust?

I've never had any problems with the police either. I really do have nothing to fear: you could go through all the files on my computer and just about anything I've ever done and my conscience is clear. That's probably the reason I so intensely dislike being treated like a de facto crook by politicians who themselves seem to have no principles, morality or integrity.",1425935563,

There will be believers in the workplace, but none will have the illustion that it's sane to start preaching, to have heated discussion about religious issues or to bring religion into workplace politics.

I've attended a Christian high school, though. That doesn't really mean much in terms of curriculum over here, the only official difference with non-religious schools was that the days were started with prayer, which is something I just let slide off me. Most students were not taking that stuff seriously in the first place, although there were a few pious exceptions. Most teachers also treated the whole thing more as a ritual. No real frustrations there.

The frustration was with the unseen but noticable influence of the vocal bible thumping parents on the atmosphere. You could feel that the school was balancing on a tight rope between the 50% of parents that were sending their kids to school because it offered a decent education, and the 50% that shipped their kids there because it offered a _Christian_ education. Run a school paper in such an atmosphere and you're bound for censorship hell. The obvious hipocrisy irked me at the time.

I still can't grasp the fact that there are people that honestly believe in the bible. A part of me liked it better when I thought everybody was just treating this as some joke of a social ritual like most of the Christians I met seemed to be doing.

Cause you know you must be the only one in the world on Reddit who speaks or writes in French. Not only that there must be no other complicated languages out there except for French which you obviously use. Let me bow down before you.

1. Next time don't be a prick when you type words in to the box and hit submit.

2. It's easier to do a grammar check for French because words are conjugated, and formulaic. English is a muddled mess. Indo-European languages with the exception of German and English (possibly some Norse languages, I've never really looked at their struture so correct me if I'm wrong) generally have strict easy to formulate grammatical rules. Unlike those languages German and English have many exceptions not only on a language basis but colloquially.

Eh, this may be the case where we understand a word differently, but it is my understanding (as well as that of several biologists whose works I've studied) that evolution often produces ""optimal"" [i.e., relatively, circumstantial favorable traits). That's how species survive in one ecosystem and adapt to another, or adapt to changes.

Through the process of evolution, favorable traits arise that assist a species of reproducing.

In the analogy, the experiences and interactions of millions of people over the course of thousands of years has resulted in systems that work. For them.

wtf does that even mean? egypt buying weapons from the soviets was cassus belli? what about israel buying weapons from britain and france *at the same time*?

&gt; after Egypt amasses tanks on the border and internally announces the beginning of an invasion.

that's as much of an excuse to launch a war as north korea would have right now, when usa and south korean troops are maneuvering on their border. yet somehow i think you'd howl if dprk launched an artillery barrage on seoul...

&gt; Yes, because Lebanon has carried an act of war, an attempted assasination of an Israeli diplomat. Either way, it was 1982.

an attempted assassination of a diplomat by an unofficial  militant faction is a justification for invasion and occupation of a sovereign state? you don't really believe in that bullshit, do you? learn to differentiate between ""cause"" and ""excuse"".

&gt; Yes, because Lebanon (Hezbollah =&gt; Syria) has carried an act of war, executing a military operation to kidnap Israeli soldiers on Israeli soil, and then shelling north Israel with artillery, killing dozens and paralyzing the entire country for weeks.

foreign soldiers on occupied territory cannot be kidnapped, they can only be captured.  israel was still holding onto shebaa farms, which is lebanese territory that hizballah rightfully claims as cause of resistance.

&gt; And that was done, rightfully, to prevent buildup of Hamas arms. It failed, thus a thousand dead in operation Cast Lead.

No, *you* have it backwards.

&gt;I think it is you that has government completely backwards. While I agree that governments assert POWER (not authority), the inaction of the citizens legitimize the power to authority.

Inaction?  INACTION!?!?!?  So not wanting to get killed, go to jail, or sent off to some eastern European torture facility is inaction, and thus what legitimates government authority?

Let me ask you something.  If you and your partner were kidnapped, taped, bounded, chucked into a trunk of a car, and then put in the middle of a room on a chair, unbounded, untaped, and are now ""free"" to move, and there are kidnappers pointing their guns at you telling you that you both need to follow the rules they lay down, which are to not approach them or else they will kill you both, let me ask you something:

Does the fact of your inaction, and believe me you will be in a state of inaction, does your inaction ""legitimize"" the power to the kidnappers?  Imagine that you are trapped there for so long, that you and your partner have a child, and the child is born into this structure of life.  Imagine that the kidnappers also replaced themselves with new kidnappers and they hand off their guns from one generation to the next.

Imagine this process repeating, where eventually the kidnapped people have no recollection of what life was like before the kidnappers existed.  Imagine that the people continue to stay in a state of ""inaction"" because the kidnappers have more and bigger guns.

Then imagine that one of the trapped people in some random generation in the future posed the question: ""I don't think the kidnapper's authority is legitimate, because I don't want to listen to them, I want to do what I want"".

Could the world count on you to say to this person ""Hey, the men with guns do have legitimacy, because...well...you don't do anything to stop it!  By your ""inaction"" you are legitimizing their authority.""

It was in this intellectual vacuum that business cartelization occurred in the early 20th century, and after about 30 years of mainstream economists having largely out of context, memorized conclusions of the classical economists' free market conclusions, that is when Keynes appeared on the scene.

Did not find any, apart from vague references to bureacracy.

One of the links you provided is not working. The other does not make much sense (sorry, humans are not computers and use decimal rather than binary fractions, besides NOTHING in metric system makes it unfriendly towards binary fractions).

&gt; And these Europeans, do they prefer the Metric System because they grew up with it

The point is, that advantages of imperial units are quite unclear to those numerous europeans (me included) even when forced (by the environment) to use the imperial system for many years.

&gt; that evolution often produces ""optimal"" [i.e., relatively, circumstantial favorable traits).

Favorable? Yes. Sufficient for survival? Sure. Optimal? No way.

And this might be the crux of the matter. There is no question that imperial system *IS* useable. Similarly, there is no question, that both systems rely on somewhat arbitrary base units (meter vs inch). And it goes without saying that there always will be niche units (used in a particular domain but not others)

But metric system has two distinct advantages: it's very scaleable (can easily express any measurement result) and this scalability is universal (done the same way with all units) and it's very friendly towards decimal fractions.

(Do note that both of these considerations did not exist when imperial units first arose).

&gt; One, arrogance. Something like, ""Scientists are smarter and prefer the Metric System. Therefore, the Metric System is superior.

How dare they to think that they are smarter?? Arrogant bastards! Think of it! These are the same liberal scientists which corrupt out children with evolution nonsense and earth is round garbage. Kill them with fire!",1425935897,

So, as the United States weakens, who is Israel to turn to? To help them, allow them, to continue its apartheid, rascist politices that tweaks the noses of some 1 billion muslims, if not all gentiles? Who will now allow Israel to continue to use its intelligence agency to undermine the nations of the world, by setting larger, but seemingly disparate peoples, against each other?

There are indications that Israel is playing buddy-buddy with India and China; playing the old the ""enemy of my enemy is my friend"" routine; perhaps using the siphoned billions from western central banks as a negotiation chit; perhaps Israel thinks it can go it alone now that the world has been reduced, lowered to its level.

However, as a CIA study suggests, there is a potential end-game where israel may find itself alone, fending for itself, against a world of teaming hostility, with its former protector, the United States, broken eonomically and feuding within itself. Ultimately, the zionists running Israel have to protect its apartheid state, and the Jews who live there, and here in the United States.

Therefore, it would be logical to assume that there could be plans for any potential end of the Jewish state. A new diaspora as this study suggests.

Because the an end-game implosion of the Israeli state can only be amelioriated by a mass diaspora of the Israeli populations to the world at large, it is logical that the United States would be the most logical destination for this new forced migration.

As the pieces of Jewish, or rather zionist domination, are already in place (largest population outside Israel, Israeli think-tanks &amp; PACs, Jewish dominated media, Jews in congress and the senate), could it be postulated that there are now plans formulated to use police state mechanisms established by Bush &amp; Cheney in the wake of the 911 false-flag to establish political control of the United States?

We are already know that Jewish populations here in the U.S. have effective organizing and focusing abilities (GIYUS.org, MEGAPHONE, etc...), so a hidden organization to aid in this transition may already be in place.

You mean palestinian arab militants, incited by neighbouring arab countries who were lusting for dominion over palestinian land - the said indigenous population - attacked the jewish settlement for thirty years and eventually jews prevailed and kicked palestinian ass. The kill and/or expel indigenous population is a result of indigenous population's repeated failed attempts to kill and/or expel jews. That was a natural response because it is impossible to create a state when a significant chunk of it intends to destroy it. Ergo, on the choice of who stays and who leaves, the correct answer is palestinians leave. Gotta face the music.

&gt; wtf does that even mean? egypt buying weapons from the soviets was cassus belli?

Is this a joke? `Or do you really not know anything?

Egypt was illegally blocking the Suetz channel. The 1952 armistice agreement with Israel was used by Egypt to reinforce itself for an impending attack on Israel, which they have mulled for years; but not only that, they sent squads of ""holy warriors"" into Israel, armed with special blades to castrate the jews. In 1956 Israel was already in de facto state of war with Egypt after multiple subversive acts Egypt carried out on Israeli soil. 

In 1956, Nasser took control of Syrian and Jordanese military forces and announced his intention to invade Israel. With newly acquired soviet weapons and ""advisors"" (KGB people who would in just five years recruit the Egyptian hooligan Arafat to make him a ""palestinian""), Israel could not stand a chance unless we attacked preemptively. We did, and that's why there's still Israel and Egypt, and not just Egypt.

I also noticed how you conveniently skipped over the 1967 war.

&gt; an attempted assassination of a diplomat by an unofficial militant faction is a justification for invasion and occupation of a sovereign state?

Yes, because palestinians have created a defacto state within state in Lebanon and the Lebanese government was unwilling to be accountable for what palestinians did (which was international terrorism, of which the said assassination was just the latest incident).

&gt; foreign soldiers on occupied territory cannot be kidnapped, they can only be captured. israel was still holding onto shebaa farms, which is lebanese territory that hizballah rightfully claims as cause of resistance.

Bull fucking shit. Regev and Goldwasser (that's their names, which every Israeli knows by heart) were kidnapped in the middle of the day when they were riding a military vehicle, on Israeli side of the border. It had jack shit to do with Shebaa farms and everything to do with internal strife between the lebanese government and Hezbollah. Stop apologizing for the terrorist scumbags.

&gt; how can you then claim that israel withdrew if they continued military operations and killing of civilians (intentional or not)? pick your claims.

What do you think caused these military operations? Do you think we did it for the lulz every time? Palestinians were stockpiling arms and firing rockets on Southern Israel. Did you expect us to a) do nothing b) go out and rid them of their arms?

&gt; i've read a few, actually. just not ones on aipac reading list.

Yes, I bet you read the ones that left considers politically correct. Unfortunately for you, I have nothing to do with AIPAC because I am from Israel and not from USA. Unless you are trying to tell me that all the erected monuments in Israel are fake, and all the participants in all wars are lying through their teeth, you better shut the hell up and stop spreading lies.

The guy with a gun, or even 29 guns and 67k rounds of .223 and hiding in the forest is not only almost *never* heard from, if they exist, for obvious reasons ... but they are universally understood to be mistaken. Even the single family republic in Fresno is mistaken to use his example, and everyone already knows that.

In reality, there are two class of preppers making up the overwhelming majority. The Mormon styled prepper, who squirrels away food for times of uncertain supply. This is actually common on Earth, as anyone who's been overseas can tell you. Only in the US or EU would people scoff at a person with the ability to store food for the winter who did so. People run out of water and food quite often in these modern times, and having a couple hundred gallons of water and 3 months of food is a good hedge against run of the mill supply lapse like hurricanes or dry shippers going bankrupt.

The other class is not like the first. They exist, the feds have had eyes on some, probably most of them for a long time. There are groups of dozens of people living on acres upon acres, tending crops and animals, pre-dug LP/OP in 3 surrounding hillsides, standardized comm, bivouac points and scheduled patrol. Just a couple of the many things one would assume to be needed in a club created ""to survive"". Many of them comprised of veterans.

I'm not sure if Breecher doesn't know they exist, or if he purposefully didn't lump them in with the type we think of when we think mall ninja, or Kaczynski because he thinks a couple groups with organization like that are the ones who *for better or worse* would indeed control segments, perhaps entire regions/states in a hypothetical post-apocalyptic type event. 

Any ""reality"" based scenario, one not requiring some imagination like plague, nuclear attacks on 197 US cities, bases, etc ... a group like that is light years ahead of the guy in Fresno with a DPMS and 12 magazines.

Raw milk DOES cause traveler's diarrhea, I'm sure American farmers are no more or less sterile then French farmers. Part of TD is NEW strains of microorganisms you already have (there are hundreds of types of e coli which only cause mild discomfort for instance).

Normal pasteurization (not UHT, which is even more effective) kills 99.999% of all microorganisms in milk. That means raw milk is filled with 100,000x more microorganisms then normally pasteurized milk. You *don't know* what you have been drinking, and what those 100k more life forms are.

We're NOT just talking about little illnesses. We're also talking tuberculosis (a contagious disease that can spread it to those who don't chose to risk their lives so you can drink ""special"" milk).

People the WORLD OVER do things to reduce their exposure to milk bacteria. South Asia sterilizes it by boiling it, most of the western world pasteurizes it (most of Europe drinks UHT milk, like parmlat, as they have refrigerators the size of microwaves, raw milk is primarily for cheese there).

And don't get me started on the french dairy industry. Lots of their traditionally ""raw milk cheeses"" actually are not raw milk anymore, but they carefully hide that fact (they somewhat pasteurize the cheese via a process called thermisation, and is a lower temperature process that kills less microorganisms, but keeps a cheese enzyme from denaturing). French anti-science zealots don't lose their legitimacy even though they're unaware that they're stuffing their face with now safe cheeses.

Why would burden of proof fall on me?  I'm not the one claiming correlation or causation.

I will say, however, that historical circumstance made the Jews a regrettably obvious target.  One reason is that European Jews had, for about a century prior to the Nazi rise to power, undergone a process of social mitosis whereby many of the younger generation inclined towards secularism and partial integration, while other member of the same generation and older traditionalists tended to emphasize the need for a distinct Jewish identity and community.  This had the overall result of weakening the communal stability of European Jewry, without particularly increasing assimilation.

Those Jews that did break from the traditional enclaves managed some degree of acceptance into secular society largely on the strength of their careers -- typically business of the ""professional"" occupations, law and medicine.  Banking and trade funded the latter two; the mercantile trades has strong roots in the Jewish community, as Jews were the only group allowed to engage in usury during the Middle Ages, and their economic importance was both the basis of their acceptance into European culture and the source of much of the ill will directed at them during the same period.  Building on that economic advantage, many 18th and 19th century Jews could afford to finance the extended education needed to enter the learned professions.  It also allowed them invest in land -- an economically advantageous investment, but also one that incurred a great deal of resentment from the less wealthy Gentiles who typically lived on Jewish-owned land.  When Marxism amped up European resentment against the ""landowners"" and the ""propertied classes"", Jewish descent was one of the more common traits attributed to caricatures.

The result were two distinctly identifiable Jewish tropes.  One was the Jewish traditionalist, living in a Jewish enclave, aloof from Gentile society, living a daily life bound up in traditions and rituals that were mostly alien to both the secular society in which they lived and the most prevalent religion in that society.  The other was the ""merely"" ethnic Jew, urbane and social, typically well-to-do, well educated and a major contributor to bourgeois society.

Now put those two tropes in a society that is practically bi-polar after its loss in WWI.  The economic and political moorings of Germany had been radically shaken.  But because the Jewish business and professional classes had been typically more cosmopolitan and less bound by nationalism, their fortunes were seemingly, if not actually, less effected.  Moreover, their rise in part corresponded with the decline of early 20th century Germany, such that it must have seemed that the secular Jews were upwardly mobile at the expense of everyone around them.  And the Jewish traditionalists remained as a reminder of how recently the Jewish population had been largely peasant and mostly withdrawn.  This new secular Jew seemed to be displacing the German not only economically but socially as well.

All of which made for a resentment that needed no scripture or sermon for emphasis.  The disparity was visible in daily life.  But it was the apolitical nature of secular Jewry that cemented their scapegoat status.  Perhaps in order to seem less threatening, most secular Jews had contented themselves with economic and professional success.  Even when offered political office, they tended to decline and rarely served in any capacity higher than low-level bureaucrat.  This lack of high-level representation, along with the division of the Jewish community into the bourgeois, secular Jews and the religious, enclave Jews, left German Jews with practically no defense against turns in the political environment.  In other words, what may have recommended the Jews most to the Nazi party was the mix of their political, cultural and social vulnerability and the attraction of their seeming economic invulnerability.  They were easy to blame for the current situation (regardless of their role in the Biblical narrative) and even easier to prey on because of their incomplete assimilation into German society.

&gt; I am not aware of any similar accusations against Protestants, much less a traditional century-old anti-protestant cult, or are you?

Definitely.  Both the Waldenses and Cathari were accused of child sacrifice, and the social atmosphere surrounding the Protestant Reformation was incredibly virulent.  Protestants entering Spain were prone to forced conversation or outright murder.  They were heavily persecuted in France prior to the Revolution -- [French Catholics of the period frequently accused Protestants of infanticide](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/historical/research/publication/21340).  The witch-crazes of the 16th and 17th century tended to fall along predictably sectarian lines -- in predominantly Catholic regions the accused were almost invariably Protestant, and vice versa.  Witches were, of course, prone to all of the same accusations that Jews had endured in the preceding centuries -- cannibalism, infanticide, summoning storms to wreck incoming ships and poisoning wells.  And do on, and so forth.

&gt; Also, note that even though Hitler isn't anywhere around anymore there are still Catholics that are active anti-semites. How do you explain that?

I'd imagine that there are a number of explanations, depending on region and circumstance.  I seriously doubt that anti-semitism is especially characteristic of Catholics -- these days it seems to be a great deal more prevalent among Arab Muslims.  By and large the bulk of modern anti-semitism seems to revolve around the issue of Israel.",1425935964,

I don't know where this information is coming from. A ""glowing record""? You ought to be kidding me. The US is the country with one of the highest gun [crime rates](http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=6166) in the world.

&gt;Uhm... you know that knives have been used in school murders?

Yes, but it is a hell lot harder to chase people down and stab them (and possibly be overpowered/disarmed while doing so) then to walk in and pull the trigger. Sure, these things happen. Domestic violence quite often results in somebody using a knife, but you can't just execute the whole class with one.

As for the examples you've given, Wikipedia says:

&gt;37-year-old former janitor Mamoru Takuma entered the school armed with a kitchen knife and began stabbing numerous school children and teachers

You do understand the difference between a 17-year-old student trying to kill his classmates and a 37-year-old janitor? School teachers and first year students aren't exactly on fair terms when fighting against a grown up man employed in a physically engaging branch. Yes, you would be making a valid case if all crazy gunmen were 25-year-old male, martial artists, last time I checked they weren't.

I agree that you probably can kill more people with a truck than a knife, though it might be a little problematic running over very specific people, as is usually the case with school shootings.

&gt;You know what: in my country killing sprees (and family murders) occur a lot more regularly among members of the police services and army than the general public.

Thank you for reinforcing my argument. As I've said, you give a gun to a civilian, he'll massacre his office with it once he goes mad. Keep the guns away from him and you could very well save many lives. Logically enough, we can't keep the guns away from the military and the force.

&gt;Now if you remove guns from the whole society you have the following problems. Firstly, rural security is a problem. People living in rural areas are far away from police, etc.. (at least 15 minutes). This makes rural people extremely vulnerable (soft targets) without any way to defend themselves. Criminals will know that.

Unless you're living in a very large country with a rather small population density (e.g. Russia, USA, Canada, Australia), this shouldn't be a problem. It most certainly isn't the case for most West European states.

&gt;Another problem is sensitive sections of society – older people, physically handicapped people or people of diminutive size can not defend themselves.

Well, look, most people can't protect themselves. Without being a sexist, most women cannot protect themselves against your average male. That's why you have police hunting down criminals. Your average 45-year-old Jack Smith, from a first world country, should not be required to know how to use firearms, killing moves from Kill Bill, etc. He pays taxes and lets the professionals take care of that.",1425935967,

Actually, looking at the motives of the participants isn't terribly helpful in an instance like this.  Take Eichmann, for example: regarded as the architect of the Holocaust.  He was essentially in charge of the Final Solution.  Yet, he doesn't seem to have been an anti-semite.  He had an ongoing fascination with Jewish religion and studied it continually.  His interest in the subject was likely a major influence on his decision to break with Protestantism in 1937.  Ask about his involvement in the Nazi party, he said that he joined not because he felt any affinity with their ideology or cause, but rather because he wished to build a career.

The distressing fact of the matter is that a great many German Nazis participated in the Holocaust not because they had any particular feeling or opinion regarding ethnic or religious Judaism, but because the Party was the only thing going at the time, or because it stirred up nationalistic feeling, or for any number of other reasons that don't have much to do with anti-semitism.

Some obviously were anti-semites; for some, their anti-semitism was part of a grander racist chauvanism, as with Himmler.  Again, tracing the anti-semitism that did exist in that society back to Catholic teachings is easier said than done.  If you have some evidence of a direct link, that would be useful, but so far what you've given is an example from the 15th century that may or may not have had some influence.

Now bear in mind, I'm not denying that medieval Christendom had a history of anti-Jewish violence and discrimination.  All I'm challenging is the easy assumption that modern anti-semitism is a direct result of the dissemination of that tradition.

&gt; In all what you have written so far you're trying to avoid to discuss why they were in such a position to begin with.

Not at all.  Clearly the position of 18th and 19th century European Jewry is a result of their typically ambiguous, often marginalized status in the preceding centuries.  But that doesn't mean that there's a direct ideological continuity between modern anti-Semites and medieval anti-Jewish sentiment, and I find arguments to the effect that they differ in origin persuasive.

&gt; I wonder why they aren't any movements in the Church who accuse heretic sects of this today but there are still some who do the same for Jews? Of course you could hold the cynical view that there just aren't any Waldenses, Cathari or Knight Templars left to kill, but there still are some Jews to go. What do you think?

I think you've got some whacked out friends if you know people who are still accusing Jews of eating children.  So far as I know, that's an accusation only bandied about by Islamists bent on spreading Zionist-paranoia.",1425936102,

The article mentions this trend when it refers to the common complaint that ""Canada didn't exist, yet.""

The term was established back in the late 1400s in the French colony under Cartier.  By the time the war came around, the term had been in colloquial use for nigh on 300 years, passing down through both French and British dominance in the region until it was ultimately enshrined in the 1791 Constitution Act that created Upper and Lower Canada.  The locals, many families of which had been there for generations already, most definitely referred to themselves as Canadians.

And in the initial battles, that local militia formed the maintstay of the British defence because the local British military contingent was quite small and the bulk of British troops were tied up fighting the French in Europe.  It wasn't until Napoleon was defeated that sizable numbers of veteran British troops began to arrive to bolster the locals to any extent.  Those troops ultimately won the war for England, but it is disingenuous to argue that ""Canadians"" weren't involved.

You might want to read that paragraph linked above...but lets not even worry about it..why not type out the whole sentence with your commas.

*A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.*

  I think it is pretty easy to understand with or without the comma.  It is a pure pity that we don't follow it.  That was one of the very fears of the people who founded this nation and one of the reasons for the Bill of Rights...  Read the writings of Thomas Jefferson.

You do understand that the Constitution was a negative and restraining document.  You have to look at the context of the times they had just been through.  Those people would have laughed you to scorn if you tried to take their guns away.  It was certainly meant to chain down government and keep it to a minimum, local, very limited, and accountable.  

IF and that is a huge IF we had followed the Constituion, what we would have would look more like the European Union than what we have now.  It would be a Republic of Independent States - Each with a Militia.  It would be like your name.  Awesome.  

There is also this;

The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.

&gt;If I did the same to humans, would you also be unconcerned?

No, but obviously for different reasons.  Frankly, I treat humans differently because I am a human.  I could dress it up in a lot of fancy lingo, but that's basically it.

&gt;So you rely on religious motivations? You think a creator designed us each for a specific purpose?

Well, in the case of domesticated animals, yes, obviously, a creator designed them each for a special purpose:  Humans!  Domesticated animals and plants are designed from natural seed-stock for human use.  In the case of wild animals are designed (better word would have been ""evolved"" maybe?) for greater fitness.  

&gt;That's actually false, but in this case a moot point because this species of bird was going to die out anyway.

I'd love to see rationale for the suggestion that higher level biological systems (ecosystems) can exist without their constituent components (individual species).  

I assume what you mean is that many individual species can be lost without affecting the quality of an ecosystem's service.  To which, I would reply, the problem is figuring out which species can be lost without affecting the ecosystem services we desire.  Perhaps this bird is a bad example (I'm honestly mostly ignorant of European fauna), but there are certainly examples out there of species being lost that caused changes in our ability to use or profit from ecosystems (just look at fisheries as an example).  

However, my original point was to explain to you why some people value cattle differently than rare birds or other wild animals.  I'm not asking you to share that opinion.

As a side note for this example, my understanding is that the bird is making a comeback.  Many north American birds of prey have made dramatic comebacks as well, largely due to changes we made in our use of pesticides.  So maybe this species is coming back for the same reason, and will not die out anytime soon.",1425936205,

You're right. That was my error. I had a post written which detailed (if I remember correctly) three specific instances where USCU were either more efficient or more accurate. One was cooking, one concerned obstacles faced by architects and draftsmen quite regularly and the third one was more of a general description of how units must be as close to a convenient size as possible (and this being a point in favor of a system evolved along with people, rather than designed for scalability not experienced in most instances -- i.e., in daily life).

Alas, I suppose it was lost before I posted. The first article that I had mentioned introduced readers to these ideas generally. The link I provided is not working, though. I must not have copied the entire address. I'll get back to you with it.

&gt; The point is, that advantages of imperial units are quite unclear to those numerous europeans (me included) even when forced (by the environment) to use the imperial system for many years.

Your preferred system would be a system in which:
a. You were forced to adopt. (""You,"" generally, referring to the inhabitants of wherever you were from.) People shouldn't be coerced into abandoning what they're used to simply because some set of bureaucrats deemed a replacement superior.
b. You are comfortable and experienced with it. You've not been raised with ""access"" to or understanding of alternative units. On the contrary, we simply lack that comfort and experience with the Metric System (speaking generally), and it is partly on these grounds that we find it inferior. That's why you are unable to see what we find beneficial.

&gt; But metric system has two distinct advantages: it's very scaleable (can easily express any measurement result) and this scalability is universal (done the same way with all units) and it's very friendly towards decimal fractions.

Benefits largely reserved for engineers, certain scientists and bureaucrats. Most issues -- everyday uses -- require little (if any) in the way of these benefits. We're quite accustomed to taking the unit most comfortable to our need and adjusting it in binary.

In the United States, USCU should be the preferred system of the average day -- it is most convenient for us, given practical measure and tradition -- with the Metric System being used by those who need its benefits.

Breastfeeding and Adoption
Question

I have a patient who is going to adopt a newborn in early October. She would like to breastfeed the baby. Are there any reliable medications to induce lactation, or should she simply begin trying to pump in the near future?

Response from  Dena Goffman, MD, and Peter S. Bernstein, MD, MPH 
Dena Goffman, MD, fellow in Maternal-Fetal Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York                                                                                                                                                                                                         Peter S. Bernstein, MD, MPH, FACOG, Associate Professor of Clinical Obstetrics and Gynecology and Women's Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York; Medical Director of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Comprehensive Family Care Center, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York

Human milk is recognized as the optimal feeding for all infants, although preterm infants often require nutritional supplementation. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life and partial breastfeeding (breastmilk plus complementary foods) for at least 12 months and as long as mutually desired thereafter.[1] Well-recognized short-term benefits to the infant include improved nutrition, gastrointestinal function, host defense, and psychological well-being. Breastfeeding is also associated with long-term benefits to the infant, both short and long-term benefits to the mother, and economic benefits for the family and society.[2]

Given that it is well recognized that breastfeeding provides ideal nutrition and has many additional benefits, the question about breastfeeding in the setting of adoption is an important one. Adopted infants in developing countries are usually breastfed, and successful lactation without the need for supplementation is crucial for the survival of adopted infants.[3] Fortunately, success has been documented.[3-5] In industrialized countries, where supplemental feeds are readily available and are of good nutritional quality, lactation may not be required for survival but may provide substantial benefit to the mother and infant.

It is possible for women who have never been pregnant or have never lactated to successfully breastfeed. With the use of preparation, medications, artificial aids, tried techniques, and significant support, induced lactation can be achieved. Preparing the breast can entail both administering medications and performing techniques. In women who are nulliparous or have never lactated, priming the breast with ethinyl estradiol 50 micrograms 3 times daily, or with 1-time administration of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate 100 mg intramuscularly, is recommended. Preparation of the breast should also be started in advance by using a breast pump for regular stimulation of the nipples.[3]

Galactagogues are medications that can induce or enhance breast milk production and have been used for inadequate milk supply, induced lactation and relactation. The most extensively studied galactagogue, documented to be safe and effective, is metoclopramide (Reglan). Metoclopramide is a central dopamine antagonist that acts to stimulate prolactin release. Recommended dosage options include 10 mg 2 to 4 times daily, followed by a taper rather than abrupt cessation. Potential side effects include fatigue, anxiety, dizziness, diarrhea, and gastric cramping; more rarely, extrapyramidal symptoms or depression may develop. There have been no documented reactions in infants exposed to metoclopramide in breast milk.[6] Chlorpromazine 25 mg 4 times daily can be used as an alternative to or in conjunction with metoclopramide. On rare occasions, when unsuccessful, methyldopa 125 mg 4 times daily may be added.[3]

Domperidone (Motilium) acts as a peripheral dopamine antagonist and also increases serum prolactin and milk yield. This is the only galactagogue proven effective through a small double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. It has fewer maternal side effects, and no side effects have been reported in infants exposed via breast milk. However, in the United States, domperidone can only be dispensed by a compounding pharmacy, and cost varies.[6]

Fenugreek, a European herb from the pea family, has anecdotally been reported to increase milk production, although data are lacking. It is theorized to stimulate sweat production, which may enhance milk secretion since the breast is a modified sweat gland. The usual dose is 2 to 3 capsules 3 times a day until adequate milk production is attained.[6]

Oxytocin, either oral or nasal spray, has been used in women with inadequate milk supply and is reported to cause a milk ""letdown"" effect. The medication causes contraction of the cells surrounding the alveoli and thus stimulates milk ejection, which may improve production by decreasing stasis.[6] Given the mechanism of action, it seems that the use of oxytocin alone would be less useful in attempts to induce lactation.

To optimize breastfeeding potential, infants should be put to the breast as soon as possible after birth and frequently thereafter, about every 2 hours. Artificial nipples should be avoided as babies learn different suckling techniques. To promote suckling when there is a lack of breast milk, formula can be poured over the areola from a cup or dropper to promote suckling. When supplementation of breast milk is necessary initially, other options include formula feeds given immediately after suckling with a cup and spoon or the use of Lact-aid. Lact-aid is a line attached to a pack which supplies formula through a feeding tube placed beside the maternal nipple. The infant learns to suckle at the breast while obtaining nutrition and does not become accustomed to a bottle. Supplementation is gradually reduced as maternal milk supply increases.[4]

Successful induction of lactation has been reported in adoptive mother-baby pairs. A group of 240 adopted infants is described in which 80% were previously bottle-fed, 35% of the mothers were nulliparous and 23% had never previously breastfed. Of these infants, 75% were willing to nurse by the end of the first week of trying, and more than 75% of mothers felt positive about their lactation experience; 54% required supplementation for the duration of nursing, but 25% of women who had never been pregnant before were able to eliminate supplements completely before weaning off the breast. The benefit of bonding was generally felt to be more important than milk production.[5]

With appropriate medical treatment, use of techniques, motivation, perseverance, and support, breastfeeding is a realistic option, with significant benefits to both mother and infant, in the setting of adoption.

Usually, the other trains (passenger trains for cross country travel) are pretty decent except during festivals. There are separate compartments for Ladies and Gents. As far as etiquette goes, there is none, but there are some rules. Do not stand in the exit/entry corridor if it's not your station. Other than that, you just go with the flow. It is hard to explain how it works, but like many things in India (traffic for eg.) it just does.

2. It's hard to quantify what an average Indian thinks, because there is huge diversity. Imagine the different kinds of Americans you have met, and multiply that scale by hundred. Americans are perceived differently in different states and regions. For eg. West Bengal, which is communist, Americans are usually viewed with suspicion. In my native state of Andhra Pradesh, they are viewed as stupid and lazy, who can't do Math and Science. Metropolitans like Mumbai's and New Delhi's youth are usually in awe and like to emulate everything they see, and try hard to copy the accent. If you are walking on the street, you will be stared at a lot, with many people laughing at you. It's not a form of disrespect, but it's a sight which they don't usually see.
You are better known than other nationalities, so if you are white, you will be categorized as an American, even though you might be Australian of from Europe.

3. Most of the maimed beggars are deliberately maimed when they are young. So I would say it is very common, if you are an orphan. The money that they make begging, is spent on hard drugs and not food. Food, especially in the cities is very easy to come by. Never ever give money to beggars. That money will always be used for drugs. If you feel the urge to help them, give them food, but never money.

And the ones arguing for no gun control should acknowledge that they are advocating a more violent society…

Saying that a ban on guns does not take any meaningful freedom away is nonsense : it clearly does. Just as well is it nonsense to say that owning a gun will make you safer. It only makes it more likely that you end up in a gun-related accident (through your own stupidity or someone else’s criminality is irrelevant)

In my opinion the differences between the European and American mindset are largely explained due to the environment. America has more, large rural areas where the freedom to own a gun is a real asset. Europe has more large heavily populated city centers where gun-related accidents are more likely to kill innocent bystanders. It is no coincidence that countries with more tolerant gun laws in Europe are rural while the cities/districts in America that have gun control law overruled due to being unconstitutional tend to be heavily populated cities.

I live in Europe in a big city. The strict gun control laws here make a real difference on the street, make me safer and don’t take a freedom away that I can actually take advantage of. So I support them. On the other hand in a rural area I would not support those same laws for exactly the same reasons : they wouldn’t make an actual difference in safety while preventing some real benefits of owning a gun that I could take actually advantage of.

Therefore I would not support a constitutional right/ban on guns for a country the size and diversity of the USA. I think if guns were banned in Washington DC but allowed everywhere else, the net effect on America would be positive. On the other hand, the constitution of the USA is such a powerful and positive document, that undermining it by hollowing out certain parts even if they do not make sense in today’s realty would risk to destroy so much of the value of the other clauses that this is just the price to pay.

The reasoning is a bit convulted; the Traty of Lisbon refers to the ""Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union of 7 December 2000"", that refers to the ""European Convention on Human Rights 1950"" that say:

"" Deprivation of life shall not be regarded as inflicted in contravention of this article when it results from the use of force which is no more than absolutely necessary:

    * (a) in defence of any person from unlawful violence;
    * (b) in order to effect a lawful arrest or to prevent escape of a person lawfully detained;
    * (c) in action lawfully taken for the purpose of quelling a riot or insurrection.""


Seems like people really thinks that this will mean that the hangings will start shortly:

""It is obvious that this hidden footnote is intended to destroy any future chance for people to stand up against abuse maltreatment or exploitation by government and those in authority. This is immediately significant when one considers the anti war demonstrations that will take place all over Europe if Iran is attacked.""

The first huge difference is that the US is *incredibly* big. Roughly four times the size of all of Europe without including Alaska. Americans get criticized for our lack of international experience, but this is in large part due to geography - in Europe, one can travel a thousand miles and pass through a dozen countries. In the US, one can travel a thousand miles and not leave California.

Along those lines, I don't think that Europeans quite get how *diverse* the US is, either. Most European nations are 90+% natives. Racial and ethnic homogeneity makes a lot of things easier, especially when implementing socialist policies. Sweden can do what it does because its population is 95% Swede. It doesn't work as well in more diverse countries - the majority feels resentment that money is being taken from ""us"" and given to ""them"". The first attempts to get universal healthcare under Truman were aborted due to issues southern Democrats had about de-segregating hospitals. Reagan's ""Welfare Queen"" was implicitly black. Etc.

Secondly, there's the religious factor which perverts our politics. There are historical reasons for why Europe is more secular than the US, but the end result is that single issue voters are able to catapult otherwise unpopular economic ideas to national prominence.

On that note and kind of related to the above, the cultural diversity within the US is pretty extreme. A upper middle class manhattanite, Kansas farmer, white suburban family, and inner city black all have little in common, yet they're all Americans. And they're all big enough groups to make a difference politically.

The US is much more rural and suburban than Europe. Urban Americans actually have a lot in common with urban Europeans politically speaking, but America has to deal with a large rural population and a political system that gives them disproportionate power - and the correlation between population density and political attitudes is pretty high.

So anyway - I agree that Europeans and Americans alike deal with the same political questions like immigration, taxes, social policy, etc. But different experiences and different political pressures lead to very different approaches in dealing with them.",1425936470,

I was talking about **the man in the video**. And the CIA (formerly OSS) has been doing extensive propaganda operations since long before Nixon.

&gt;Where did I say ""program"" or where did it say that on the video?

watch it again.

&gt; And what fuck does Wall Street have to do with this?

What do you think the CIA is about? It's one of Wall Street's enforcers, a bully for capitalism. Many of the directors of the CIA have come straight from Wall Street. I recommend William Blum's book ""Killing Hope: U.S. Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II.""

&gt;I wasn't even referring to America. 

the **man in the video** was.

&gt;European educations systems have a far more leftist tilt to them than the US system. And it arose during the 60's, along with an almost deranged inability to admit that there were problems with the Soviet system. You can still witness it today, in the many Stalin apologists in Europe who insist that Stalin never did anything wrong.

[citation needed]

I think you are vastly overstating the effectiveness and extensiveness of those agitprop programs, and I am extremely skeptical of your claim that people won't admit that Stalin was a tyrant. 

I'm sure some people had an inability to admit the problems with the Soviet system, but that is due to their own ideological, dualism-minded foolishness, much more than Soviet propaganda. And far more people have an inability to admit the problems of capitalism. The man in the video paints a picture of anti-capitalism resulting from arrogance and brainwashing, while he essentially says anyone with any sense would just be an obedient, patriotic supporter of capitalism.",1425936510,

I am not a member of anything. I don't know what is Hadash (New, new what?). 

I am very much opposed to the sovereignty of the Jewish people. The Jewish people is not really an entity, it is more a cultural idea. Its an archaic religion. Holding on to the concept of a nation or one race or culture is idiotic, at least. 

What have I in common with an Ethiopian, Yemeni or Russian Jew? 

I may find as much in common with any other human being. 

A nation of people united by geography and maybe culture is entitled to sovereignty. British people are sovereign, some are Jews, some are Muslims, some identify with other sub groups. Some are black some are German. Some are Japanese. All are entitled, in my view to be sovereign and British and make decisions about the society they live in. 

The Jews, however, are not one nation united by a geographic location. A tiny minority of Israeli Jews were living in Palestine before the first Aliya in 1882. 

I am more than entirely aware of the reason Jews flooded to Palestine after WW2. No one would fail to understand why, at that time, they felt they had to run somewhere. But that does not entitle them to the land. 

The Hitler thing is over and done. Not one Palestinian should have suffered because Jews suffered. That is not what humans should aspire to. If those are the values we aspire to - I was fucked so fuck you, I will not cry for humanity. 

I am disgusted to think that someone can suggest Israel or any other country is not for all people. A country is an administrative entity who's inhabitants should be able to determine how their society is run. Any such country should be allowed to control things such as immigration, social policies and how they choose their leaders but no country should be allowed to exist if it has within its constitution any law which favours one group over another. 

We don't accept that in the USA, in South Africa, in Saudi Arabia, in China or Nigeria. It is fucking disgusting to defend such an entity. We strive for liberty and equality regardless of race or creed. 

The Jews are not a race, they are not a nation. The Jews have no land, they are not an entity tied to a geographic location. Judaism is a religion and a pretty  fragmented one at that. The Hassidim in my street are living in some fantasy of 1850's Poland, the frummers are like Victorian Europeans, Israelis are hawking crap in the shopping malls, spitting and talking loudly. 

I am Jewish because I was born Jewish and have been passed a bunch of cultural traits, I get Woody Allen abit more that native English. But I have a place to live and I am not entitled to steal anyone else's place, even if someone attacks me or steals my shit. 

I disaffiliate myself from any group of Jews. I oppose the existence of Israel and I want to vomit when I hear anyone talking about the rightfulness of a country which seeks to discriminate against anyone. 

I call for a UN resolution backed by the threat of force, to dissolve the Jewish state and replace it with a democratic state which values everyone living there equally. 

As to your offensive attitude - actually I don't find your attitude offensive, your views offend me. But you can't help it, you are too programmed to see that you are defending the indefensible. I pity you but I have to put up with the same all the time - everyone gushing about Israel this and that. And I can't say a word to anyone. I am sad to say that Jews have allowed themselves to turn their grief into fascism.

By FEEDING them, genius.  People need to EAT FOOD to live.  And there are a lot of places on this planet where food doesn't grow.  And they have made plants which CAN grow there.  For example, they just recently produced flood-proof rice.  In China there are places which would flood and farmers would lose their crop and people would starve.  You can argue that some benevolent angel should have come down and hand-fed every baby, but that didn't happen, and that doesn't happen.  Those people starved to death.  Now, they won't.  In Ethiopia, due to the particulate pollution from Europe, they had droughts that lasted for nearly a decade.  That was not a failure of economics and policy, that was nature.  And it killed millions.  Until genetically modified crops were developed that can grow in the impoverished soil with little water.  Now, the people don't starve to death.  THAT's how it saves people.

We don't know what the full health and environmental consequences will be when we continually let you breath.  That's not a joke, and it's not an exaggeration, it is the truth.  We have just as much evidence that things like golden rice are safe in the environment as we do that your continued life isn't a danger to all humanity.  The modifications they make for GMO crops are simple and occur in nature.  They are just able to select them more carefully.

&gt;So before throwing the word retarded, maybe you should look at your own retarded presuppositions.

I don't make presuppositions.  If I don't know jack shit about a subject, as you don't about genetically modified foods, I shut the fuck up.  I know a bit about genetically modified foods, and I don't happen to want millions of people to starve to death over some idiot not being able to read a book and understand that the risk potential for GMO foods is extremely low.

You ARE spreading lies when you claim that increased gun ownership is related to increased violent crime.  That IS a lie.  It is factually incorrect.  It is false.

What are you on?  What on earth gives you the idea that there is enough food, distributed in the proper places, to feed everyone?

Wrong.  It's a ""failure"" of basic nature.  Food grows well in some places, poorly in others.  It is not the job of the government to wave their wands and magically make land fertile.

&gt;I'm questioning it's long term health and environmental impact.

No, you're not.  Reasonable people do that.  What YOU are doing is making up retarded impossible doomsday scenarios and telling people they're happening right now.

&gt;As for Ethiopia, it is just as much about policy.

No, it's not.  For thousands of years, Ethiopia was green.  Every year, they had a rainy season that provided enough water and nutrients for stuff to grow.  The gulf stream dipped down and showered them.  When Europe started producing massive amounts of particulate pollution, it contributed to global dimming, preventing the usual amount of sunlight from reaching the earths surface.  This resulted in the gulf stream not dipping down to drench Ethiopia.  A decade of droughts means you don't have food.  Even if the western countries did nothing but send all of their extra stock to Ethiopia, most of it would rot before they could distribute it.  The logistics of distributing food to millions of starving people are impossible.  When you can provide them with more hardy seeds thanks to science, if you decide you're not going to for no other reason than you're completely uneducated on the subject and don't give a shit to learn, then you're being a monster.

&gt;You do make presuppositions and it's retarded because you said GM foods saved more lives than any other creation. Tell me how making more food than the world needs, saved more lives than penicillin?

Yes, it absolutely saved more lives than penicillin, genius.

I dont know where you get your impression that I want you to lie to me or suck up to me, or that I hate facts and truth, you are treating me like some kind of lowlife-ideologist just because I am having a debate. Please note that this was your first post in which you actually engaged in some statements that explained your opinions, something I have been trying to get out of you for a while.

I read your other posts on the board and gather that this is simply your style, but being ""angry"" would with most people not really work in your favor. Luckily I am a patient guy and refrain from getting too personal -

The facts on Switzerland do indeed not convince me, no, however they do portray a side to the topic which I find interesting. Considering the fact - if you believe wikipedia - that I posted up there you would still have to argue that they half half the guns so your first argument comparing the US to Switzerland stands unconfirmed. I dont have done particular research into this, but the first info I found on it sais the opposite of what you say, so that in itself is interesting considering how very loud you are about this.

Also, I always refrained from saying guns are the only factor in violent crime, obviously a city like London or Manchaster have a higher crime rate as i.e. idylic Geneva or a Mountain-Village in the Alps, it might be possible that Luxemburg has the highest murder rate in Europe per capita, who knows!

You still have not explained why the US has 12000 deaths a year and Europe doesnt. 

And no, I dont have to study Iraq or Tahiti to make a study about Gun Control in Germany, or any study for that matter. That is a claim I find ludicrious as to be coherently supportive of it you would hae to isolate any topic in all nations in all cases to gain any sensible results on anything. clearly this is nonsense as certain factors are trivial and play no role and others do - guns availability being certainly more of a factor in gun crime than the cost of red meat or the speed limit.

It will come to a moment in the history of his planent when there will be a moment of time when it comes to violence. You can tell me that it wont but the law of propbilites tells me otherwise. History simply repeats itself. There was a moment of Alexanders the Great's life where he to make a choice between the logical and the illogical choice. When Alexander was a little boy he liked horses but so was his father Philip II. In the movie Alexander in 2004 there is a scene where the young Alexander rides a horse just bought from the local horse dealer. That story is made up, but there are more then one story about Alexander's horse, as-xe-tos. ([Translates](http://www.motormint.com/ProductImages/fullsize/TAXI.jpg) loosely into the word ""Man's soul"" The lore of the horse Asxetos, is that the horse was the spawn of Pegasus mating with a normal horse.

So when Alex was a young boy and went hunting he would leave his horse to hunt small pray but one day the Persian hired assassins to kill him. To avoid having to fight grown warriors the young Alexander had to think fast to escape death. They almost had him but Alexander's horse was special he would respond to a trumpet/horn. When blown the horse would race to his master's side. So Alexander leaped onto his horse and pointed to the distance and screamed ""Ho Steed to Bel-Air!""

I just decided to post some random bullshit right here to camouflage up the punchline of the jok. Yeah it was a ""bel-Air"", how was it? Was it good? I bet it was good. Well good for you! So I think this is enough camofluge to hide the punch line. Don't want to be giving away the joke too early now do we? No we don't.

The US bailout provides funds to AIG. AIG has a subsidiary, EMI which provides 95% financing of [mortgages in Israel](http://emiltd.co.il/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=33&amp;Itemid=56). 

Today in Washington, Senators [were asking Geithner and Bernanke](http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200903121805DOWJONESDJONLINE001068_FORTUNE5.htm) to provide answers as to where the $163bn bailout of AIG is going to, and they are being stonewalled.

It's not at all racist to point that out. Israel&lt;-&gt;US foreign relations is not a race.

Political dissension over foreign policy wrt Israel has practically zero to do with race. It began as such, though. One of the main reasons European jews were implanted into what is now Israel was to create a hegemonic wedge in the Middle East. This expands the West's sphere of influence into the most strategic portion of the globe.  

It is not the fault of the Jewish race that any of these events occurred. ""Israel"" is the name that we use to describe something that has many sides to it. When people talk about confronting Iran, it is because we do not want regimes that control the world's natural resources to have nukes. 

The west funded Israel's creation so that it is not shut out of that region. The anger and resentment in response to that policy has nothing to do with the people in Israel being of a certain race. It is the least relevant piece to that discussion. ",1425936671,

Telling anyone what they *must* believe is going to rub some people wrong, particularly if you insist they must believe it because you've mistaken a caricature of their beliefs as their actual beliefs.  As I've pointed out elsewhere in this thread, literal interpretation of the Bible as the inerrant word of God is the larger part of what makes a Christian fundamentalist.  Behaving as though moderates should have to conform to the logical conclusions necessitated by a fundamentalist belief is as fallacious as it would be for a Christian apologist to argue that all atheists should have to accept the conclusions of the most extreme atheist position.  If you don't share that position, why should you have to buy into its logical end?

&gt; Where are these Christians? Europe? New Hampshire?

Granted they're not especially numerous in America, but according to the Newsweek poll you quoted in another comment, around 36% of the U.S. population doesn't think the entire Bible should be read literally.  Given that, it's worthwhile asking what they mean, or took the pollsters to mean, by the phrase ""word of God"".  Europe having a larger Catholic population likely means they're even less inclined towards Biblical literalism, since literalism is primarily an innovation of Protestantism and the Church has always relied on councils and proclamation to mediate Biblical interpretation.  It was the Catholic Church, after all, that provided for the academic studies that resulted in source criticism.  Pretty much any Christian who's been through college level religion or theology courses can be counted upon to have some familiarity with and acceptance of the findings of source criticism, so you'll tend to find moderates at the more educated and leisured end of the economic and social spectrum.",1425936693,

""Eastern"" seems to be a stand-in for ""Not European or American.""  It is a catch-all for the traditions of any culture from the Mediterranean to the Sea of Japan over the last 2500 years.  Making any claim about what anything in this set ""generally"" is, is ludicrous for obvious reasons.

I think this is a trap many people fall into when speaking against anything non-Western, but it is also a snare for Western people who speak FOR the ""East.""  This is a lesson I have learned the hard way many times.

In your blog text, you make claims about the basis upon which Eastern philosophy is based. Keep in mind that even if you narrow the field to Buddhism, then to Mahayana Buddhism, then to the various subsets of Mahayana Buddhism, you are still speaking about an enormous number of thinkers, ideas, texts, and monastic traditions.  Some of them base their ideas upon experience, while others have strictly defined methods of backing every claim they make.  Often, even minor claims were debated back and forth for decades before a school would adopt them as part of their ""philosophy."" Again, generalization is almost always tantamount to misrepresentation, and if you try to argue anything in grandiose terms you will not get anywhere.

That said, your professor is still making an error by dismissing what you have written out of hand.

I would say that the greatest error your professor is making is passing off hundreds of deep, rich, and expansive traditions with nothing but a cursory glance.  He has read the Reader's Digest version and decided it is not for him.  This is, in some cases, the problem with academics, and why academia is not the best context in which to engage with philosophy.

I would encourage you to ignore the old goat, and instead spend your time reading and learning what makes sense to you.  Try to enjoy the simple pleasure this brings rather than feeling the need to win an argument.  Victory in an argument is useless if afterward, you still feel angry.

The goal of philosophy has generally been to maximize peace of mind and happiness, not to win an argument.  Sadly, sometimes in academia the ends are sacrificed for the sake of the means.

Anyway I enjoyed your article, I definitely fought this battle when I was in college, and I think your approach was thoughtful and engaged, exactly what being a student is about.

&gt;""The idea that life on Earth has evolved was widely discussed in Europe in the late 1700's and the early part of the last century. In 1859 Charles Darwin supplied a mechanism, namely natural selection, that could explain how evolution occurs. "" 

From the other article you linked in a parent post:
&gt;Darwin continually emphasized the difference between his two great and separate accomplishments: establishing the fact of evolution, and proposing a theory--natural selection--to explain the mechanism of evolution.

Like I said: Evolution was an observation, natural selection was an explaination for it.

Again from the article:
&gt;more recently the classic Neo-Darwinian view has been replaced by a new concept which includes several other mechanisms in addition to natural selection. Current ideas on evolution are usually referred to as the Modern Synthesis

Like I said, Evolutionary theory is no longer just natural selection. But several other mechanisms as well. Its not called the theory of evolution, nor was it ever. That is all.

These distinctions are important, as they allow you to better dismantle your opponents in discussions about their misguided creationist/ID ideas.

They, like you (and I), are trying to beat into overly dogmatic religious people that there is no discussion about how this is possibly false among actual scientists.

You're using your opponents language, which is a great error of framing, and is setting yourself up for a loss. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_(social_sciences) .

That's cool.  I should have phrased a little clearer though... I meant it more as why complain about it as if it is actually significantly worse than in other places. (rather than just feeling worse)  I  haven't yet seen someone do an actual survey of all articles and comments posted in this reddit versus, say, the politics, religion and WTF reddits and categorize each article and posts and analyze them in this light.

I know I've done similar for some of the other general complaints (we don't pick on Islam enough) and shown them to be more emotional or from a perspective that doesn't match up.  (I'd have to dig up the post, but I showed that we actually had Islam critical posts about 8x more than we should based on the populations, assuming reddit's demographic is roughly similar to the US/European one.)

&gt;Sure, maybe out of subscribers, they aren't many. But they are loud.

And for the most part they're very easy to ignore.  I almost don't even notice them anymore, focusing my scans on posts with actual content in them.  Much like when I'm in a restaurant with friends, I focus on what they're saying rather than the 30 other conversations going on around me.

They're not a level yet yet where the amount of text involved makes it hard to pick out some useful discussion.

&gt;I said 'most'. I don't really think many people have thought it through like you did there.

Let us take the current State Brand Inspectors and put them to work in the following areas:

    License all stallions and let the fees for the licensing go to cover the brand inspectors fees.

    Secondly let's start charging a breeding fee for every foal born, call it an ""End of Life Fee"" this fee would be held by the states the fees should be steep enough to cover end of life fees, along with help in replacing the     
    Revenue from the horse meat revenue lost by the closing of the slaughter plants.

    Lastly let us impose the ""End of Life Fee"" as a tax to all who profit from horses. All horse show, horse races, equine goods,  large animal veterinarians, Veterinarian hospitals, everything to do with horses has that tax.     That tax will replace the lost revenue from horse meat.

What this all boils down to is money, and let's not have horses suffer the human greed, let man have his money and horses maintain their dignity with a dignified end of life clause for all breeders.

NOW the Urgency and need for a big voice!

The states are trying to bring horse slaughter back to the United States to supply a few European countries with horse meat. I make no judgment of people, I simply believe with all my heart that horses are not intended for food.

If one state gets this type of bill passed this month it will open the door for other states and bring back slaughter we fought so hard to end here in the U.S.

&gt; The Eastern Catholic Churches were located historically in Eastern Europe, the Asian Middle East, Northern Africa and India, but are now, because of migration, found also in Western Europe, the Americas and Oceania to the extent of *forming full-scale ecclesiastical structures such as eparchies, alongside the Latin dioceses.* One country, Eritrea, has only an Eastern Catholic hierarchy, with no Latin structure.

[...]

&gt;Canonically, each Eastern Catholic Church is sui iuris or autonomous with respect to other Catholic Churches, whether Eastern or Latin, though all accept the spiritual and juridical authority of the Pope. Thus a Maronite Catholic is normally subject only to a Maronite bishop, not, for example to a Ukrainian or Latin Catholic bishop. However, if in a country the members of some particular Church are so few that no hierarchy of their own has been established there, their spiritual care is entrusted to a bishop of another ritual Church. This holds also for Latin Catholics: in Eritrea, they are placed in the care of bishops of the Ethiopic Catholic Church. Theologically, all the particular Churches can be viewed as ""sister Churches"".

As an aside, they have an interesting report on [European aid to the Palestinian terriotires](http://www.cidse.org/uploadedFiles/Regions/Israel_-_Palestine/CIDSE%20seminar%20report-09.11.08.pdf).

Here's an excerpt (page 14-15):

&gt; **There are at least three main trends characterizing donor aid in the West Bank and Gaza at present:**

&gt; _First_, there is very little development money available; assistance is primarily humanitarian and emergency response. Clearly, this sort of assistance is needed but it is a short-term solution that does little if anything to prepare for the future.

&gt; _Second_, after Annapolis there is once again a trend of directing substantial donor fund flows directly to the Palestinian Authority (PA), which means to the West Bank. Gaza is neglected except for the salaries of those civil servants who obey the Ramallah-based government. Of course, those salaries represent important remittances but contribute nothing to economic change. Furthermore, many people are paid to stay home and could be analyzed as being counterproductive in many ways. It also would be naïve to assume that the PA is using donor funds in the most transparent, effective manner possible. It is important to note that while PA officials continue to drive the latest and most luxurious cars, travel frequently and comfortably, send their children to private schools domestically and abroad, lodge their families in Amman, and build mansions, the human development indicators of the Palestinian people are plummeting.

&gt; Donor strategies that by design or effect, support and strengthen the fragmentation and isolation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, that divide Palestinians into two distinct entities offering exclusivity to one side - economically, politically and diplomatically - one good (Ramallah) and the other evil (Gaza), one deserving of sustenance and largesse and the other not - will have dire consequences not only for Palestinians but for all of us. As Karen Abu Zayd, the Commissioner-General of UNRWA, warned, ""Gaza is on the threshold of becoming the first territory to be intentionally reduced to a state of abject destitution with the knowledge, acquiescence and - some would say - encouragement of the international community."" She further argues, ""Humanitarian and human development work was never meant to function in an environment devoid of constructive efforts to resolve conflict or to address its underlying causes. Indeed, humanitarian work is profoundly undermined in a context where there is implicit or active complicity in creating conditions of mass suffering. This is the situation bedeviling Palestinian prospects.""

&gt; Furthermore, Palestinian society is now largely dependent for its survival on external aid and not on its own productive resources. According to the analyst Khalil Nakleh, ""nearly one million live on their PA monthly salaries [which are dependent on] receiving donations from outside on time; no less than 40-50 thousand live directly on their salaries from externally-funded NGOs, and some many more thousands live on NGO projects etc. Thus, the livelihood of most Palestinians who have 'steady' income is mortgaged by political decisions external to them, and beyond their control.""

&gt; _Third_, donor discomfort over the Hamas authorities in Gaza has resulted in a policy of either withholding funding from them or being so directive about how assistance can flow and to whom, that it borders on the immoral. Gaza is a room full of children who deserve protection. Yet, donor assistance, particularly from the United States, is directed in ways that deselect whole swaths of the population.25 The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), for example, permits no assistance of any kind to go the Ministry of Health in Gaza although the Ministry meets the health needs of hundreds of thousands of people. This is because the Ministry is controlled by Hamas.  
&gt; Effectively and practically, this denies urgently needed equipment, pharmaceuticals and disposables to anyone who ends up by design or accident in an MOH hospital or clinic.

&gt; U.S. government rules in the war on terror mean that an American organization working in Gaza - even if it is a conduit for EC emergency funds - cannot contract to build, say a reservoir, in a municipality that the USG has deemed Hamas because then the US organization would be in danger of breaking OFAC (U.S. Treasury Office of Foreign Assets) rules with legal liabilities. Hence, it does not matter how much the community may need the reservoir; political imperatives supercede developmental ones. This also happens in the West Bank where, for example, an implementer may not be permitted to help with the water system in a given village because the local council is perceived as ""Hamas.""

&gt;But I'm not going to run around with my hair on fire blathering about sci-fi scenarios of scientists splicing carrots with rocket launchers and letting them loose in day care centers like all these imbeciles I'm replying are.

I haven't really said anything along those lines of this, so perhaps you're prone to hyperbole?  At any rate, I didn't mean to accuse you of corporate apologism by quoting him.  My point is that your viewpoint is equally unscientific.  Watching a video about GMO is not going to give a research level understanding, I just wanted to see if you understood that.

&gt; Try not judging what things ""sound like"" and what they actually SAY sometime.I would never say it is IMPOSSIBLE to create a harmful GMO. it would be extremely difficult, because you would have to splice very different things together which we almost never do and therefore have little experience with

This does not help your credibility.  My point was that you have an irrational acceptance, as opposed to the irrational fear that you're crusading against.  I hesitate to throw the words 'truly scientific' into the discussion, but if you're serious about a phenomena even your joking examples will have some scientific relevance.  Cows + tomatoes does not make you sound like a fucking scientist, just so you're aware. I reiterate you again:

&gt;we almost never do and therefore have little experience with

 I think the issues of deliberately introducing less viable species into the gene pool, or creating species who release more toxins into their environment, are pretty important reasons to have some pretty strict controls on the use of geneplay until it is better understood - for the exact reason you suggest:  We really don't know what else might arise as a problem with GMO until we've already let the cat out of the bag.  I suspect this is why Europe has been so quick to require full disclosure on the sale of GMO foods - allowing an informed choice that people in North America might not have.

&gt;No, because there aren't poison apple to splice them with and the wide genetic variance between poisonous plants and food plants means there's very slim chance they've ever produced a poison apple.

Have you never seen the common textbook example of the [tobacco plants with firefly genes?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Glowing_tobacco_plant.jpg) It's was in my middle school text book over a decade ago, so you've got no excuse here.  ""Very different things"" means nothing to a genome.  Do you know what GMO really means?

 Okay, as for the something can't come from nothing, I see your point, but evolution is not about explaining that, that's what the big bang is all about. The Big Bang theory is a whole different argument that happens to be way over my head, so let's not get into that. Evolution is about explaining how life has come to it's current stages, and understanding how life will continue to develop.

No evolutionist will make the claim that evolution happened once, in fact we make the claim that evolution is happening all the time, and that it's observable in micro-organisms and thus the fact that evolution is occuring today is a proven one. This is where the whole creationist ""Micro-evolution vs Macro-evolution"" argument comes in. It's been proven 100% that single celled organisms evolve, and at a pace we can observe in human lifetimes, so many creationists call it micro-evolution to distinguish it from multi-celled organisms. Of course, evolving apes into men would be an impossible experiment to perform, it would take millions of years, even in Dexter's Lab. ... Sorry, couldn't resist.

As for the fish in different parts of the world, this is actually something that helped prove the theory of plate techtonics. The man who proposed that the earth consisted of plates of crust that could slowly move around the world developed his hypothesis observing the rock formations of mountains. He proposed the idea after some testing and was ridiculed. There were these crustacean things, the ones that the fossils kind of look like underwater roaches... they have a very distinctive name i can't remember. Their fossils were found off the coast of europe and off the coast of the Americas. And everyone was baffled. Of course some brilliant group of researchers revisited the plate techtonic theory and said ""hey, if the continents are moving, that would explain how these fossils came to rest in such far away places, and would also explain why the rock the fossils are found in is the same composition""

As for living fish found in different places, I'll leave that to the researchers studying them to explain. The ocean is still mostly a mystery.

The proximate reason why the Europeans conquered America is because the Europeans had guns, germs and steel.  The ultimate reason (and I paraphrase an entire, very good book in half a sentence) is that Eurasia lies on a horizontal axis, and so crops and animals first domesticated in Iraq in 7000BC could be grown in same climate in Germany, Eygpt, Indus and Yangtze valleys.  With agriculture came food storage and distribution, cities, and 8,500 years of shared development so that even a fool like Columbus could achieve great things.

So, the proximate reason why Africans never discovered Madagascar is because the winds make it really hard to find unless you have sophisticated ships and crews.

The ultimate reason why East Coast Africans never developed sophisticated ships and crews is because 
sub-saharan Africa is a great place to develop the human species but a terrible place to build a city; the crops available a few hundred miles North won't grow, the malaria is terrible and herding Rhino is impossible.

So without cities and agriculture there was little trade, little reason to develop ships to carry the trade and little reason to develop better ships.  By the time that existed in East Africa, Madagascar already had a population.


In short, because of an accident of geography European humans had thousands of years head start on the other two major continents to develop civilisations based on food surplus from agriculture.

Truly, I recommend the Jared Diamond book.  Mind expanding ideas.

&gt;You are still arguing that because people have believed false things that nothing is ever true.


Come on Lou. Try reading what I’m writing. Of course some things are true. We have evidence that a good many things are true, a god may or may not be one of those things. One more time; 

You and I would both agree that the overwhelming majority of gods that people have claimed as real have been false. Are we agreed so far? Yes? 

Those people genuinely believed that their god was real. Yes? 

You also believe that your god is real. Yes? 

Next step. One of these statements will be true: One of those gods is real. A set of those gods may be real (for polytheistic belief systems). No god is real. You OK with this?

I don’t know how many different belief systems there are. I can think of Indo-European belief systems that would rack up several hundred gods. Add in Hinduism, and animistic belief systems, plus all the religions from the past that were never documented and you have untold thousands of gods. Let us tidy that up and say for the sake of argument that there have been just 10,000 gods that people have believed in. OK?

So it is *ten thousand to one* that that any particular one of our gods is actually real. 

1. How do I distinguish your claim from any of the others? 
2. Why do you think *you* are so special, against all the odds, that you are convinced that the belief you happened to be raised in (you did not question this assumption when I mentioned it earlier) is the correct one? Those born/raised within the other belief systems have/had an equally strong conviction that they were correct.

The Jewish people is not really an entity, it is more a cultural idea. Its an archaic religion. Holding on to the concept of a nation or one race or culture is idiotic, at least.

In other words, all these jewish persons who do see themselves as jewish people, and who therefore constitute the majority part of jewish society, and who desired sovereignity so much they fought and died for it, should all waive all this effort because *you* wished to distance yourself from them?

&gt; What have I in common with an Ethiopian, Yemeni or Russian Jew?

A Russian Jew one-liner will answer that for you:

&gt; *They hit you in the face, not in the passport*

&gt; A nation of people united by geography and maybe culture is entitled to sovereignty

And that is exactly what happened, the idea of nation of Israel was revived to preserve the jewish people, who, absent geographic unity and facing persecution for their united culture, were about to be wiped out.

Either way, your criterion is arbitrary. The true criterion is a large enough, dedicated enough group of people who is willing to uphold their sovereignity by force of arms.

&gt; I am more than entirely aware of the reason Jews flooded to Palestine after WW2. No one would fail to understand why, at that time, they felt they had to run somewhere. But that does not entitle them to the land.

Under the same standard, what does entitle the palestinians to the land? That they were here a hundred years earlier? Moreover, what does entitle the palestinians to *all* land exclusively? How is their initiation of force in an act of aggression justified, and that is without even going into the real reasons why there was aggression in first place?

&gt; The Hitler thing is over and done. Not one Palestinian should have suffered because Jews suffered. That is not what humans should aspire to. If those are the values we aspire to - I was fucked so fuck you, I will not cry for humanity.

The conflict between jews and arabs in Palestine has started way before Hitler. Europe destroyed the Ottoman empire and instituted arab countries with borders, which led to clashes of power; new arab countries set out to  take control over Palestine, a delicious piece of land of great strategic value to everyone. They exploited the local tribal population of arabs to create a conflict with jews, to make it look like they were the liberators and not the invaders. They made their intentions of absorbing Palestine very clear. This is all documented so thoroughly I am surprised how little people know of this, especially those who brandish the left flags, because the bulk of this documentation is available to them through their favourite revisionist historians such as Khalidi.

&gt; I am disgusted to think that someone can suggest Israel or any other country is not for all people. A country is an administrative entity who's inhabitants should be able to determine how their society is run. Any such country should be allowed to control things such as immigration, social policies and how they choose their leaders but no country should be allowed to exist if it has within its constitution any law which favours one group over another.

Israel is a country for all of Israel's *citizens*, and as you said yourself Israel has a right to exercise (and so does) control over who becomes a citizen. That's what I mean by Israel not being a country for all people. If you do not object that, then what exactly do you object? 

&gt; The Jews are not a race, they are not a nation. The Jews have no land, they are not an entity tied to a geographic location. Judaism is a religion and a pretty fragmented one at that. The Hassidim in my street are living in some fantasy of 1850's Poland, the frummers are like Victorian Europeans, Israelis are hawking crap in the shopping malls, spitting and talking loudly.

&gt; The Jews are not a race, they are not a nation.

Now they are. And a nuclear capable nation too.

&gt; The Jews have no land, they are not an entity tied to a geographic location.

Now they do. They paid exorbitant prices for it, by the way.

&gt; Judaism is a religion and a pretty fragmented one at that.

I am an atheist. Don't get me started on that! :)

&gt; I am Jewish because I was born Jewish and have been passed a bunch of cultural traits, I get Woody Allen abit more that native English. But I have a place to live and I am not entitled to steal anyone else's place, even if someone attacks me or steals my shit.

Why do you necessarily presume that Israel was ""stolen""? It was, if anything, a fight that jews won against all odds.

&gt; I disaffiliate myself from any group of Jews. I oppose the existence of Israel and I want to vomit when I hear anyone talking about the rightfulness of a country which seeks to discriminate against anyone.

Some of the discrimination that exists in Israel is unjust. Some of it is justified. Israel has to fight its enemies and the enemies we have are bitter and sneaky. They rely on underhanded tactics, and force us to do so as well or lose the fight.

&gt; I call for a UN resolution backed by the threat of force, to dissolve the Jewish state and replace it with a democratic state which values everyone living there equally.

I call for physical elimination of anyone attempting to carry this out.

You may not ask the jewish people and the israeli citizens to review the question of their national identity so that it becomes more fit with your personal conscience. I have no problem with you denying the thousands of years of jewish culture and achievements to yourself - that is your personal prerogative. However, I find it abhorrent and outrageous that you dare to demand imposing this denial on other people, and to advance by means of force the idea that this culture and society can be dissolved - and that is without pointing out the basic falsehoods your reasoning rests upon - and specifically the idea that there is, or ever was, a palestinian nation or legitimacy to such.


&gt; As to your offensive attitude - actually I don't find your attitude offensive, your views offend me. But you can't help it, you are too programmed to see that you are defending the indefensible. 

As a matter of fact, my views are something I developed completely on my own. I do not consider them indefensible at all; rather, I am of the opinion that the only people who can blindly reject them as indefensible or immoral are not well enough versed with the history, which taught *us* a lot of lessons. My views are the summary of these lessons.

&gt; I pity you but I have to put up with the same all the time - everyone gushing about Israel this and that. And I can't say a word to anyone. I am sad to say that Jews have allowed themselves to turn their grief into fascism.

Without diverting to point out that what we have in Israel is nowhere near real fascism, I would say that while the current situation is regrettable, it is the preferred outcome over cessation of existence of the jewish people, culture, thought and language.

I've been this way for well over a decade, and the reason: I looove North Indian cuisine. It's got such a rich variety of vegetarian dishes, I don't feel like I'm missing anything. And I'm not talking about your average curry-rice or whatever 8-10 dishes you can find in a typical ""Indian"" restaurent. I'm talking about authentic home cooked (sometimes exotic) food.

I've been in Europe for a few years and had a glimpse of the typical continental cuisine as well as stuff from elsewhere around the world. There are great vegetarian dishes everywhere, you just have to try them. But in general, european/american food sucks when it comes to vegetarian dishes. Most are just boiled vegetables.

&gt; To President Peres’ chagrin, the Executive Summary states that “during the next fifteen years more than two million Israelis, including some 500,000 Israeli citizens who currently hold US green cards or passports, will move to the United States. Most Israelis not in possession of these documents will receive ‘expedited waivers.’ The Report claims that, “Alongside a decline in Jewish births and a rise in Palestinian fertility, approximately 1.6 million Israelis are likely to return to their forefather’s lands in Russia and Eastern and Western Europe with scores of thousands electing to stay, depending on the nature of the transition.”

Luckily I was unscathed as was my father. We were pretty shaken up though. I had been backpacking throughout Europe for about a month and a half at that point. My dad, staying with my uncle in Prague, met me in Krakow for a few days and we were on our way back to Prague. I actually almost missed the train as I went to the wrong platform. Things were going well for the first few hours. Not paying attention we sat towards the front of the train until the ticket taker directed us to our seats in the back. That was probably the luckiest thing that could have happened. An hour later, after just closing my eyes in an attempt to catch up on some much needed sleep, I felt a large shudder and I was flung forward in my seat hitting my head against the seat in front. The shrill screeching of the brakes still resonates in my memories. There were three distinct movements as the cars in front of us were buckling, being derailed, and flattened. People were being thrown throughout the car. The stewardess who was checking ticket (yet again) was thrown twenty feet across the car, breaking her nose on something. When the train finally stopped I checked to make sure my dad was ok. I then checked around the cabin, seeing that no one else was critically injured. I quickly exited the train on the left to see what had happened. The sight was [intense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Train_accident_in_Studenka,_Czech_Republic.jpg).

I quickly got back on to my car and told that my dad we had to get everyone off asap. After starting to evacuate our car a few of us rushed to the front, where the situation was much more dire. It was there where I saw dead bodies. People were pinned under wreckage. They were unconscious and limp. Some had severe bleeds. There were severed limbs. Their cries for help were psychologically deafening. EMS crews were just starting to arrive on scene. We were very lucky to have wrecked just outside of Studenka. Pulling away wreckage proved futile as people were pinned under cars, not just pillow seats. EMS crews quickly moved us away from the wreckage to a staging area. There was a steady stream of ambulances for the next 45 minutes or so. Many of us passengers went to the pub that was next to the staging area. A few hours later we were all on another train to Prague. I sat next to an elderly Australian couple who began to complain of the three hour delay in their trip. It really pissed me off. Seriously?

**""Clean coal"" is a myth, but clean nuclear isn't.** Why are people scared of nuclear power? Three reasons: nuclear weapons proliferation, nuclear waste, and the threat of radiation.

But nuclear weapons proliferation isn't a threat in the United States, since we already *have* nuclear weapons. Modern nuclear reactor designs (like pebble-bed and CANDU reactors) produce waste in well-contained packages, and support reprocessing of waste into fuel. And a coal-fired power plant produces more radioactive contamination than a nuke plant, because coal contains traces of uranium, which end up in the atmosphere.

Want to reduce air pollution? Support nuclear power. As a knock-on effect, making electricity cheaper would improve the value proposition for electric and plug-in hybrid cars. Nuclear power is one of those places where we can have an ecological win whilst creating abundance -- a kick in the pants to those who believe that eco-friendly means artificial scarcity.

**Impoverished nations don't make much pollution, but unfree developed nations make much more pollution than free ones.** China is the #1 polluter by a long shot -- and an unfree political system deprives the grassroots of the ability to start an ecological movement as happened in the United States and Europe. In the free world, activists can demand change; in China, activists can get shot.

&gt; As far as the actually point at hand. I think the major difference is that the Africans and Jews did not have a choice. Rather, they were forced into making the choice. 

See, ignorant. Slavery has been common in the lands around the Sahara for centuries before the Atlantic triangle trade. Whites themselves would be captured and sold as slaves (including even Michiel de Ruyter), which isn't as odd as it seems if you know the word 'slave' comes from Slav (the Eastern European population group that includes Russians and Poles).

When Portuguese, Netherlandic and other Western European ships arrived on the north west coast of Africa, they could at most make a dent in the existing kingdoms... a very tiny dent. Aside from being overwhelmingly outnumbered, not knowing the terrain and having their weapons and tactics adopted, malaria and other diseases ensured the WE's would have to wait until the arrival of machine guns and better medicine before they could start their Scramble for Africa.

In other words, Africans weren't forced to sell their enemies -other Africans- into slavery. They just did it to get rid of them and get weapons and valuables in return. Taking prisoners of war =/= snitching.

maybe we should start with what money is? money is a thing that can be used as unit of exchange, that is, to purchase goods and other stuff. a claim against a physical or legal person that can be used for the purchase of goods and services is called [credit money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_money). 

forget banks, you can create a credit money without them -- you just write document that states you owe someone money (in any form), and this way you create a credit money. if people know that you're very likely to fulfill this promise, this paper you've wrote will be almost as good as a physical object.

you should start trying to understand what money is, there is a freaking long [article in wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money) describing it, maybe this way you'll understand that money is not a physical thing and rules of conservation are not applicable to them -- they can be created at any time.

&gt; &gt; assets grow exponentially, so money supply also has to grow exponentially

&gt; Its impossible to disentangle these two when one is valued in the other.

by assets growing exponentially i meant not asset value growing, but assets themselves growing: more plants are built, more houses are built, more things are invented, more goods are produced. if economy grows, amount of everything grows.

&gt; &gt; population grows exponentially

&gt; Yes, especially when its fueled by a fake monopoly money explosion.

there is no correlation between population growth and money explosion: very poor countries with effectively no money (people use natural exchange there) experience drammatic growth, while some wealthy european countries and Japan experience decline in population. please stop pushing your agenda and start thinking.

&gt; Moreover, the concept that we can simply infinitely keep the current exponential feedback loop going is ludicrous.

i did not say it should grow forever, just while it grows, it should grow. maybe we have already reached limits by now, but, say 50 years ago we were very far from limits, but people like you would say that we should have stopped expansion then.

&gt; The combination we have now of Fiat + Fractional Reserve + Central banking is unsustainable, and in fact is the most dangerous of all possible mixes.

nothing is sustainable. except, maybe, North Korea kind of state, where people can't do anything without goverment approval.

imagine some very static land where population stays same, farm and industrial production stays same, money supply stays same. seems to be sustainable? no, it is not actually: sustainability would require people to have no savings (besides what they are planning to spend at elder age), everybody should spend everything what they have earned. it is easy to see what will happen if somebody will start saving money -- money in circulation will be decreased, then prices will go down, making one who started saving even richer. eventually this will end up with people who have saved money owning everything while the rest would be very poor.

so, you see, static money supply does not work even in imaginary static world: for it to be sustainable you need to seize property of people who're trying to save money.

inflation actually fixes this problem, being a hidden tax on money savers -- it means it is not that profitable to put money in the pile, and increasing money supply prevents deflation.",1425937583,

You mentioned the UN partition plan of 1947. Now I want to ask you to look at the British Mandate of 1920-1948, and before that Ottoman territorial holdings. If you wish you can delve even further into history and see that there has never been an Israeli state in the region until 1948.
Of course Palestine rejected the 1947 UN Partition for a few good reasons reasons. 1. It was administered and decided upon by a group of Europeans who felt guilty for the hardships experienced by Jews during the Holocaust. Palestinians were not in the UN, they had no say about what was going on with their homeland. 2. It had been their home for centuries, and suddenly some foreigners come in and take it away and give it to your spiritual enemy. Its asinine to assume Palestine would be content giving up their nation without being included in the decision process. 
For example, imagine your family owns a house, its been in the family for generations. Suddenly a couple of guys from across town tell you that you now must share your home with the people who your family has been feuding with forever. Would you say, ""oh yea, great! you guys take upstairs and we will take downstairs""? No, you would say ""get the fuck out of my house. THIS IS MY HOME!"" 
And realistically even if you did decide to say ""lets split it up"", eventually you are going to cross paths and then the home turns into the war zone, much like the Middle East has. 

The constant violence of the Middle East that it is characterized with today is a modern phenomenon. Sure there have always been bloody wars in the region, but those were more about religion, and today they are more about policy.

You say Israel is a responder nation, I agree with you on that. Unfortunately Hamas is also reactive, and not proactive. Palestein has a very sound claim for their violence, because in many ways they are simialr to the American founding fathers. America was threatened by British controls which they had no influence in deciding and thus they resorted to terrorist tactics to fight the occupying British. The same is true for Palestine, they are not waging war against Israel, they are defending themselves from Israeli encroachment. 

You also mention how Jordan and Egypt were willing to settle for peace. Well this also makes perfect sense. Nasser in Egypt was completely outclassed, his troops were equipped with far inferior weaponry and he was more concerned about keeping Egypt together than fighting a war. Also, one should not forget the antagonism the British and Americans were causing in regards to Nassar trying to nationalize the Suez Canal. Jordan too was a weakened state, and could not engage in prolonged combat. But here is the kicker, Israel, a newly formed nation somehow kicked their ass completely, thanks in large part to American weapons and training. It is no coincidence that with American built fighter jets flying over Jordan while many of the king's troops lacked automatic weapons that Jordan would also be begrudgingly happy with peace. Sure Israel was also happy to stop fighting because it had made considerable territorial gains, and anything more may have invoked the ire of the world.   

But the fact remains that Israel should never have come into existence the way it did, because lets face it, it cheated another group of people out of their home. If Israel had been formed through rebellion, much like America and most of Continental Europe, then its place on the map would be far more legitimate, but because Israel came into existence because of the guilt of foreign politicians and generals, well that does not bode well for legitimacy. Palestine had their homeland removed from them and given to their sworn enemy, I think they have every right to be pissed off. That does not mean I agree with their course of action, but again Palestinian aggression is a response to Israeli presence, and now it has become that Israeli aggression is the response to Palestine's fight for sovereignty.

You're right, rooting for the underdog should not be a governing principal in who we choose to support, but you see Palestine is only the underdog because they were cheated and omitted, and I think there is something very different between supporting an underdog and and not supporting the top dog. 
This is also a reason why I don't support the massive amounts of aid Israel receives from America, because if Israel were to stand on its own, then Palestine would no longer be an underdog, but more of an equal contender. Think of it as Political Darwinism. If a nation cannot stand on its own, then it is too weak to survive. Obviously this is much more ambiguous these days with economic interdependency, but I think if Israel can hold their own without American support then they deserve to have their spot on the map, but as long as they rely on American hegemony to do their bidding, then their position on the map is legitimately dubious...unless Israel decides to become the 51st state.

&gt;That's kind of an arbitrary metric. Someone says that the government takes n% of income as taxes, I say it doesn't, then you suggest we modify the original problem because the government doesn't take taxes for some things that governments in European countries do.

And I said this is what some economists have come up with whilst pointing out that you don't even get good service and if you were to do a like for like comparison you'd have to factor in that you don't get as much.

&gt;It does a lot more than waste it. It's just that the waste is the only thing you hear about... especially if you're on hive-mind sites like Reddit.

The hive mentality is to doublethink away from questioning the status quo for yourself. Even the Grace Commission back in '84 said,

""[With two-thirds of everyone's personal income taxes wasted or not collected, **100 percent of what is collected is absorbed solely by interest on the Federal debt and by Federal Government contributions to transfer payments. In other words, all individual income tax revenues are gone before one nickel is spent on the services which taxpayers expect from their Government](http://www.uhuh.com/taxstuff/gracecom.htm)**.""

You think it's got better since then?  Bridges are falling down for want of a little service whilst debt has soared and the US government is the largest it has ever been.  Oh, and the real cost of living is up too.

&gt;While I'm not a fan of the stimulus package myself, this is not such a black-and-white case story. 

I'm laughing.  You're going to pay for it and instinctively you'd rather keep your money in the bank and show fiscal responsibility...so they cut a check (which you ultimately will have to pay) that manipulates you into being less frugal.  Oh, and there's no guarantee that the stimulus money will either work or that there won't be a lot more.  What it does mean is that the Chinese are eying very carefully what is being done to the dollar...something that they have every right to - since they practically own it!  

Meanwhile money intended for America is going overseas to offset the souring of US investments of others.  Not black and white?  It's positively shining out in monochromatic fluorescent neon!  It's tantamount to stopping a hurricane by pissing in the wind.

&gt;  America was threatened by British controls which they had no influence in deciding and thus they resorted to terrorist tactics to fight the occupying British.

This is my whole point. We need cuts of 90%+ of todays levels to stand half a chance. This needs to happen within a few years. IT WON'T. Wishful thinking will not change that. I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news. 

The wars, drought, starvation, migration and death of which you speak will happen if we forced China or India** to make such dramatic cuts as large chunks of their populations would be thrown into unimaginable strife and poverty. Ironically, nuking ourselves back to the stone age is probably the only way such cuts could be achieved, though there are some obvious downsides to that.

Stop believing that countries like China or India are going to listen to us on this They won't. And without them, we cannot stop this. I'm not the one in denial here i'm afraid. On the contrary, i fully accept the hopelessness of our position and believe our biggest aim should be the survival of humanity. If we don't, then the mass extinction that follows will leave us and most life currently on the planet as irrelevant as the dinosaurs. In a million years, Earth will be thriving again one way or the other, it's simply a question of humanity will still be around.

Finally i did not mean to suggest that we could invent our way out of this. I actually have a much worse feeling about what is coming that you seem to. IMO, the only insignificantly tiny chance of this not ending with most humans dying is a technological breakthrough. Who could have predicted in 1939 the technology of 1945 - necessity led to all of it. Other than that, preperation is our only option to ensure that some of our species remain with at least some of the knowledge that has taken thousands of years to develop.

ps - you may notice i created this reddit account specifically to make my first point. I did it because your views are correct and noble, but misguided and i'm sorry to say, naive. It is only when there are enough intelligent people thinking in a pragmatic way about this that may allow humanity to survive. Sadly i am not the best writer in the world and it is a tough issue to concisely summarise your views on within a few paragraphs, but i promise i am not baiting you. Please just think about how cuts of this level could ever be achieved within the necessary timescale. I am sure that in time, you will reluctantly come to the same sad conclusions that i have - they can't.

Ok, I found an article that refers to the paper I remembered, which was titled, ""The Future Vision of the Palestinian Arabs in Israel."" It's here: http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/mar/01/israel
If you google, you should be able to find a pdf of the proposal. Sorry I don't have time to hunt it down myself, but it shouldn't be hard, now that you have the name, if you're interested. There's a fair amount of civil rights info out there. Did you know for instance, that there was a law created in 2003 that has the effect of separating Palesitinian families? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_and_Entry_into_Israel_Law

aarrgh...I was afraid you'd ask. I've forgotten the name of the paper, and am having some problems locating it, but in the meantime you might want to read this paper by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, about land policy:
http://www.acri.org.il/eng/print.aspx?id=578

And I'm afraid that a certain amount of Zionist disregard for Palestinian life has existed from the beginning. Don't you remember hearing about the early 20th century Zionist slogan, the ""land without a people for a people without a land""? But there **was** a people living in the land, the Palestinians, so the slogan, and the subsequent treatment of the indigenous Palestinians, was dishonest, right from the start. (I say this fully acknowledging that the pogroms and other treatment of the Jews in 20th century (and earlier) Europe may have created an urgency to find a homeland that *caused* the disregard. But the Palestinians should never have been expected to suffer for the horrors visited upon the Jews *by Europeans* - the Palestinians were not to blame.)",1425937654,

I'm an anthropologist by the way.

You don't need a grain grinder to eat grain, you need to grind it to make flour which was something many cultures did do but didn't need to do. They used a mano by the way which is the name for the pestle, the mortar could be any flat stone we call metate. The only thing I can think of off the top of my head that had to be ground was acorns so the tanins could be leeched out.

A typical neolithic diet would include a lot of wild grain, fruits, berries, nuts, veggies and maybe a small bird or two in a week. As I said, most energy was received from plants. You seem to be trying to fram my statement in another light, something pretty dishonest for you to do.

Man as the ""Great Hunter"" has been pretty thoroughly debunked except when mankind found it's way to a new continent and found wildlife that wasn't afraid of them. Which is why horses, cameloids and at least one species of bison went extinct in North America.

We have plenty of archeological evidence, especially patterns of wear on teeth, to show that early man had far more vegetarians or people who ate very little meat than we have to show that early man ate a lot of meat.

We also have a lot of evidence that pre-neolithic man didn't for the most part go out of their way to live in freezing climates though those that did live in freezing climates tended to make the agrarian transition before the neolithic.

And yes potatoes weren't available to Europeans in pre-neolithic times. Of course they weren't available to Peruvians either at the time. Neither were olives or bananas available to South Americans or North Americans. I was giving a list of food you are familiar with today and in fact foods that are available year round to many or most consumers. The food that early man was familiar with was substantially larger than you or I are familiar with today. Your argument seems to conveniently and repeatedly ignore that.

Hint, modern man deals with cold much differently than ancient man. For that matter humans who haven't lived in houses deal with cold much differently than those that have. You're making a fallacy to suggest that.

You know what else there wasn't in pre-neolithic society? Society. At least in the way you use it. You might find 25 people living together but even that would be a high number.

sure the drought has much to do with the problems. but for farmers to have to BUY their seed every year, one bad year means no future crops, ever. and their promises have fallen far short, witness the ever greater amounts of pesticides, this isn't propaganda, one simply has to do the research. and, of course, the fertility of the soil has dramatically fallen in the last few odd years that monsanto has taken over. a simple comparison with regions that haven't embraced monsanto's policies, regions with the same rainfall, same soil conditions will show that eco-k00k is far from false dogma. for you to dismiss it without making any scientific comparisons only confirms my suspicions that your are a corporate shill. perhaps you might supply some facts to go with your dismissal?

I also take notice that you chose to disregard the well documented efforts on the part of monsanto to stifle competition, and their love of lawsuits to bring farmers to heel. or their huge contributions, not only to the politicians that favor their policies but also to the very companies that are supposed to be doing unbiased research. as far as I am concerned, the judgments about GM foods being safe or not have not been conclusive, I am not convinced one way or the other. the FACT that it is now against the law to label foods as GM runs counter to open information, makes me wonder why monsanto pushed so hard for that choice bit of legislation. (and to dismiss europe as k00ks, well...)

terminator seeds? what a wonderful idea if the theory of genetic drift turns out to be true. (BT has been found in the genetic structure of plants growing next to GM foods, lending a fair amount of credence to the idea)

MONSANTO and its ilk is just one more step in the ongoing campaign...

Again, take 15' off your time, and go to a nearby field. Collect all the seeds that you can. *Assuming* that you are lucky, and there's enough grasses in season, weight the seeds collected. How much will you have collected in 10 hours work? 'Would' does not substitute for hard data.

Teachers will also tell kids to their faces when they do a poor job or slack off... though I hasten to add that some teachers could really instill fear in their pupils. I remember my digital machines teacher who made some students so stressed they visibly shook in the corridor before her class started.

This culture persists later in the work place. I used to manage a team of Poles and I always told people when they did a good job and told them to their face when I had concerns. When I felt someone wasn't pulling their weight I gave them several stern warnings. This was expected and accepted. Everyone knew where they stood. When someone got fired it came as no surprise to them and they rarely held any grudge. They knew exactly why they were being let go.

Moving to the west was a shock for me. Nobody here points out mistakes or tells people that they slack off. I built my house a couple of years ago and I acted as my own general contractor. When I told the drywall guys that they did a poor job in a couple of areas they became upset immediately.

Whenever I read stories that are abusive work hours almost always tend to be a factor. What percentage of places that you audit have people working more than 48 hours?

SA8000 is quite strict- from memory of what I read in the report that factory would fail. The limit is 48hrs of regular work and 12hrs of overtime per week and I recall that they showed an example of someone working more than that.

If you walked into a random group of factories in China the vast majority would not be able to achieve this standard. Our factories are better as we usually have a significant amount of their production and they're used to the required standards.

The question of working hour restrictions is another ethical one that isn't so black and white. As a colleague of mine once explained to me, in the US or Europe we don't want to work so many hours in a week as we want to spend evenings and weekends with our friends and families. In China, however, workers come from distant provinces to work at factories- their objectives are to work for a few years and save up enough money to build a house or open a small business back home. 

The workers will have an amount of savings in mind and ideally they want to achieve this in the shortest time possible and then go home.

Firstly, Asylum seekers.  They seem to get the worst of the press, however it is clear to me that anyone granted asylum, or indeed waiting on an asylum claim to be processed, should be granted all the protection possible, have housing, clothing food etc.. made available and once their application is accepted they should be granted a right to work and access any services they need access to.

Illegal immigrants of course are illegal, they clearly have no right to work or otherwise utilise state resources beyond those that should be available to anyone (justice and health).  An effort should be made to identify and deport illegal immigrants.

Legal immigrants however fall into a number of categories with a variety of conditions attached to their remaining in the UK.  Of course anyone from the European Union, (well at least most of it) should have the same, or similar rights to remain (and to services) as a British national.  Other immigrants however have a right to remain that is conditional on their having work and not drawing on state funds.  This latter category could, if out of work, have their right to remain terminated (as they no longer meet the conditions for remaining in the UK).

So in short, the press and politicians like to paint this discussion as one of absolutes when it is not, understandably the general public also seem to think that the debate is based on absolutes, often failing to see the distinction between immigrants, asylum seekers, illegal immigrants and all the rest of it. This is clear to see when the discussion is centered around immigrants 'stealing jobs' 'immigrants getting houses for free' and 'thousands of pounds in benefits every week'.",1425937816,

Ask yourself what you really want from it?  You'll probably end up getting something completely different.  It _is_ horribly expensive, and you should be prepared for a certain degree of flexibility in what you get out of it vs. what you expected to get out of it.  You should basically aim for (a) the name on the diploma, (b) the alumni network and (c) the knowledge, in no particular order; (c) you can get more efficiently and cheaply from books and individual courses if you have some time and discipline.

The problem is that the economies are very interconnected.

There is a sort of prisoners' dilemma: it is in each country's interest to under-stimulate but persuade other countries to stimulate and then benefit through exports to those countries.

Similar concerns motivated the ""buy American"" provisions that some attempted to put into the stimulus package. It is not so important in the US because imports/exports are a smaller fraction of the US economy than inter-EU imports/exports are for individual European economies.

This is what Krugman was saying here:
&gt;What Europe has, instead, are national governments, each of which is reluctant to run up large debts to finance a stimulus that will convey many if not most of its benefits to voters in other countries.

Moai carving and transport were in full swing from 1400 to 1600, just 122 years before first contact with European visitors to the island. In those 122 years, Rapa Nui underwent radical change. Core sampling from the island has revealed a slice of Rapa Nui history that speaks of deforestation, soil depletion, and erosion.

See the table at page 40.

The [forth search result](http://psychservices.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/50/12/1606) gives the mean age of 20.9 years for entry into prostitution.

The people couldn't build boats or houses or even rope to go fishing with.  They turned cannibal before starving to death.  The population  dropped from 10,000-20,000 to about 2,000 (when the first Europeans discovered the island) then to about 200.

Nobody really knows why they persisted in cutting down the trees even when it was clear that they were headed for catastrophe.  They weren't stupid; carving, moving, and erecting a solid stone statue that weighs 300 tons is a very challenging task, even today.  They were aware of the problem; the approaching disaster would have been apparent decades before the last tree was cut down.  Someone was shouting, ""Stop it!"" but wasn't listened to.  In fact, they accelerated the building rate as they got closer to the end.  My guess is that the cause was political.  They did have a political society - those statues simply could not be built without it.  Their leaders either insanely insisted on building those statues or lacked the political will to stop their construction and thereby change the status quo.

Beware of ""Economists"" preaching the value of a devalued currency.  It sure looks funny when you read it. Here's what Krugman has to say about how Spain ought to respond to today’s crisis:

""In the past, Spain would have sought improved competitiveness by devaluing its currency.""

Devaluation of a currency benefits a only small number of people in the short run but borrows from everyone who holds that currency. A country must infuse large amounts of cash into the system to devalue its currency.  This cash will be distributed by a central bank to commercial banks. Those commercial banks will be able to provide cheap loans to whoever is looking for a loan at that very moment.  Subsequent higher interest rates will punish borrowers who otherwise might have gotten funding (if all that cash hadn't already been loaned out).

We can see the picture that large cash infusions distort who receives money--those who are willing to borrow money today—rather than tomorrow—will be rewarded.

However these cash infusions punish the vast majority of people.  Currency devaluation is, well, the decline in value of a currency.  That means every dollar in the world loses a bit of value when the Federal Reserve makes cash infusions (aka “lowers its interest rate”).

Our options are limited:
1) Devalue our currency such that our dollars purchase less milk and bread AND we finance billions in risky loans.
2) Maintain the value of our currency and make irresponsible borrowing unaffordable.

I choose #2.

For the last 20 years we have had large numbers of cash infusions (aka low interest rates).  Look for yourself: http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data/Monthly/H15_FF_O.txt

What has America gotten?  Sounds like what Spain has had a lot of:

""For much of the past decade Spain was Europe’s Florida, its economy buoyed by a huge speculative housing boom. As in Florida, boom has now turned to bust,"" Krugman continues. ""Now Spain needs to find new sources of income and employment to replace the lost jobs in construction.""

Like America, Spain's recent period of currency devaluation has lead to inevitable bust due to irresponsible spending.  If Spain wants to stimulate its economy it must encourage only worthwhile investments through solid lending practices.
A bailout, such as that supported by Krugman, might be financial death to Europe.  That is why individual countries are unwilling to finance massive debts--because it will financially bankrupt them:

""What Europe has, instead [of a large central government], are national governments, each of which is reluctant to run up large debts to finance a stimulus that will convey many if not most of its benefits to voters in other countries.""

What Spain, America and much of the world are experiencing in this so-called ""financial crisis"" is the result of a currency devaluation crisis that has been going on for the last 20 years.  

Our central bankers and central governors have devalued our currencies to the breaking point.  Infusions of cash--borrowed from our own future spending--will not enrich us, but impoverish us.

Beware of “Economics”…

It is deeply rooted in the American culture and mind that it is better to have no ceiling or floor than to have a floor but also a ceiling. I can recall hearing this idea in many forms, but the basic idea is this: to the extent that you have a safety net, you also have a glass ceiling. It is better to have limitless potential than safety.

Americans view Europe as a comfortable plantation in which the slaves are well cared for. However, Americans think that in Europe a person cannot exceed a certain middle-class level by their own intelligence or hard work. They think Europe has a glass ceiling. If you are born rich, you stay that way. If you are born poor or middle class, the highest you can rise is middle class.

If this were true, I'd agree and I'd bash Europe along with the American right. But it's not true. Europe has entrepreneurship, and America is far more socialistic than the American right will admit.

I think the American right is skilled at the manipulation of this sentiment. They manipulate it to hide from Americans the fact that we have developed our own caste system and our own landed nobility. Our nobility is born into wealth, given trust funds, and sent to elite ""Ivy League"" educational institutions. Their family ties and Ivy League connections constitute a noble title that entitles them to a life of greater wealth and power than the commoners.

The right used to argue that America's nobility wasn't a true nobility since they could fail. After all, in America we have a free market. Recent events have exposed that as a lie as well. If you are a member of the nobility, you get a bailout. The free market only applies to commoners.

America is seething with a quiet anger over this. I expect to see some serious realignment in the future, unless the right can channel the whole thing into vapid anti-intellectual populism. They are good at that you know... they channeled the 60s counterculture into vapid New Age fluff and they successfully defused the 90s libertarian movement by branding it as the ""militia movement"" and linking it in rhetoric with terrorism, racism, etc.

No, they don't fit well with any of the main Socialist schools of thought in their current forms under control of the State

&gt;You are describing Marxist ideas of socialism, there are many schools of socialist thought and they existed before Marx came along

Yeah, there did, it doesn't mean Marxist thought was a clean break from that. What I said it distinctly Marxist, but it's not entirely at odds with any other school of Socialism, I should have expanded by saying Socialism can also be said to be in place if there is no classes. Even the Socialism that preceded Marx rested nominally on a class basis.

&gt;Again, Marx and Engels don't define all socialist thought, only their take on it.
&gt;I think it has alot to do with it in places like Sweden where the taxes socialised are spent to benefit society. Maybe not so in Americe because most of the tax revenue is spent on the military.

These are commonly repeated arguments, there did exist socialism before Marx but they were a series of disparate ideas usually brought together under 'Utopian Socialism', not only were they ridiculously Utopian (compared to the 'Scientific' Socialism from Marx based on actually looking at history and drawing theories rather than broad ideas of equality) but they wern't radically different from Marxism. Utopian Socialism had no concept of how to achieve it, so yes, ideas of revolution and transitional stages are only found in Marxism but that doesn't mean Socialism was ever, or can be, anything to do with some nominal wealth equalisation. Even the Socialists that pre-dated Marx were all about communally owned property and a lack of hierarchy and anything that came after Marx was usually a watering down of Socialism and attempts to marry it with liberalism - which is exactly what these things are, putting some Socialist ideas in to Capitalism to blunt it's worst excesses, not to mention most of these things were won by Working Class movements often driven by Marxist parties.

The wikipedia article is quite good on this (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism). Even the Reformist movement (the only other really significant Socialist school remaining I think), which is what drove the European Social-Democracies such as Sweden, originally had much the same aims as Marxists but different ideas on how to achieve them. This became watered down to a point where in no way could it be considered Socialism.

**I am not nor have I said or implied that early man lived off plants alone.** You are putting those words in my mouth repeatedly and I did not say them. To continue your course you are admitting to be a horrible liar and nothing more than a liar.

Avocado is available in at least California year round. Rather than stick with a ""gotcha"" plant I gave many more examples of year round edibles in temperate and even arctic climates. Your paleo-diet that you keep pushing has been debunked pretty thoroughly except by a few goons who think it makes them more manly or whatever you delude yourself with.

Here's a decent list of typical foods available to different hunter-gatherers:

http://www.scribd.com/doc/6299194/Hunter-Gatherer-Nutrition

That isn't the most representative of foods either however and typical hunter-gatherer food knowledge would have been much more vast than this for your typical person.
http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;start=13&amp;q=http://books.google.com/books%3Fid%3DyLmGPtZTHUYC%26pg%3DPA45%26lpg%3DPA45%26dq%3Dhunter%2Bgatherer%2Bdried%2Bfoods%26source%3Dbl%26ots%3DNDbMWIZE5E%26sig%3D1kl3f0evpUXxUJa79e-cOwhKqzs&amp;ei=9fa-Sf7uHJCaMqHalK0N&amp;usg=AFQjCNGtbo1sKQfKjQLqMXuO0ySGFD6aFQ&amp;ei=9fa-Sf7uHJCaMqHalK0N&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result

That is a pretty good book overall and where it links to is a good breakdown of caloric requirements and availability for typical hunter-gatherers.

While this is about caching meat it shows that caching food works well and was used by at least some early people:

http://www.ur.umich.edu/9495/May08_95/storage.htm

There's no reason to suggest that people who knew their territory exceptionally well wouldn't know where they left food or to suggest they wouldn't cache food for later use or make use of other food preservation techniques (smoking, drying, storage pits). Certainly many of the meat preservation techniques by early nomadic man were easily used on plant foods as well.
You are also making the faulty assumption that early man was well fed during the winter regardless of how much meat they ate or didn't.

&gt;Grasses. I am not talking about wheat, but wild seeds. This kind of verborragic misdirection on your part reflects badly on your degree. Again, you think that paleo men could have survived on wild seeds. Even if I were to disregard the definite season of seed-bearing plants, I'm suggesting a simple experiment. Just go outside, and try to collect the equivalent of 2lbs of seeds/day in 15'. You may use any grass, leguminose or forb.

No, I said seeds were a part of their diet. What is with this all or nothing argument you keep making? Stop assuming I am saying something I'm not. I've been pretty clear, I thought, that I never once claimed humans were pure vegans or even vegetarians. Cut it the fuck out. You're also making a asinine limitation to seeds from grass.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_edible_seeds

Yes I know that at least some of those were not available to early man, most specifically corn, wheat and rice. I just need to get that out there since you deceitfully like to take everything I say in the worst possible context. I've got a feeling you will use what seems to be your usual misdirection that 1 oz of pine nuts (available year round in quite a range of latitudes) yields 190 calories. That means for less than 1lb you have 3000 calories (also containing many important nutrients). This is a higher calorie to weight ratio than ground beef. They are also available across N. America, Europe and Asia. Easy to harvest, use a  rock or let the pine cone sit by a fire.

&gt;False. I never used the word 'hunter' - my point being that plant matter is insufficient to sustain a non-agricultural man year long, and nothing else. For what I care, men could have been a scavenger chasing out jackals. Again, using red herrings is quite silly.

I suppose you didn't use the word hunt, hunter, hunted &amp;c. You're point was specifically disagreeing with me saying most energy was derived from plants. I've even said early man tried to eat meat often. What kind of troll are you? If you don't know what most means it means a significant portion, not all, not none and more than half.

&gt;Nope. You either set up a strawman, or were unable to comprehend that I was referring to the plant availability in winter.

Wow. You say try living outside of your insulated house in the winter on plant matter. I show a famous example and you can't dodge quick enough so you just deny it and accuse me of fallacies? I provided a direct example of something you implied didn't happen. Imagine that. 

Here is how it went:

&gt;&gt;&gt;Hint: Go outside of your insulated house and try to survive in your winter on plant matter.

&gt;&gt;As for living in the winter on a vegetarian diet, you should look into hair analysis and dental analysis of Iceman. You'll find it is entirely possible and very likely that he did just that at least until a short time before he was killed. Here is a decent, well cited, and easy to read writeup on it: http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/reprint/13/3/559.pdf

&gt;Irrelevant. Ötzi was firmly in the neolithic age. From your article:
The neolithic age had nothing to do with your challenge.
 

&gt;Your caloric needs do not vary. I do not care about your society size.

I didn't say or imply that. I said that a particular amount of land can only support a particular number of people. Your response doesn't even look like a response to what I wrote. If I need 1 acre of agricultural land to feed 10 people (I don't know the specific number; I am just making an example) and I try to feed 100 people with it than many people are going to starve or be malnourished. There is a maximum amount of people land can provide nourishment for and even that amount of land depends on climate.

&gt;He dealt with winter, because he was a member of a farming society. As we are talking about man in pre-agricultural times, including such 'example' in a discussion is either an example of incompetence, or basic dishonesty.

Did you ignore what you wrote and I replied to? I quoted it just a few paragraphs up.

Don't cite articles comparing Neanderthal's diet to modern man. We are not descended from Neanderthals.

So far your entire argument seems to frame my argument as something I did not and have not claimed. The fact is plant food is much easier to come by and more plentiful that animals (unless you count insects which I somehow think you aren't counting) in most of the world save for the particularly northern climates.
A particularly good write up on ancient diet can be found here:

http://www.ltspeed.com/bjblinder/book/secure/chapter4.pdf

The papers you linked to at the end are not views commonly held by anthropologists despite their popularity with the paleo-diet crowd.

I said there are other flavours of Socialist thought (I forgot to mention Anarchism as another major one), but Social Democracy is not one of them

""Social democracy is a political ideology of the left or centre-left that emerged in the late 19th century from the socialist movement and continues to exert influence worldwide""

Again, historical legacies, some have openly come out now and renounced this legacy (Labour Party - Britain), some still claim this legacy but in practice long ago renounced the ideas (Socialist Party - France). It is quite easy to see the radical departure Social Democracy had from it's Socialist routes, to brand these two wildly different ideas under the same heading is quite frankly, ridiculous. Marxism isn't the only flavour of Socialism, I openly said that earlier (""because you want socialism to be discredited ideas of Marxist communism "" - I openly said otherwise, so don't twist my words), but that doesn't mean anything can be Socialism. FFS Hitler claimed to be a Socialist (While clearly renouncing Marxism) but any sensible analysis in hindsight clearly says he isn't. It's important to see the difference between people staying true to the Socialist ideals (Which isn't just Marxists, Marxism is a methadology with a view to Socialism, there are other methadologies as I stated earlier) and Social Democrats who have taken ideas from Socialism and removed any class basis from their work and any view to destroying Capitalism, or the Class system itself, from their ideas

Look back at the early history  of the Reformist movement and you see exactly the same thing, they continued to claim to be Marxists for a long time becuase that is what drew the working class in, they were long ago shown to be otherwise (""Kautsky has turned Marx in to a common Liberal"" - Lenin), modern Social Democracy is essentially doing the same thing.",1425938553,

&gt;There is a place for a free market, which does not exist when global corporations are few in each area of the market.

What is inherently wrong with few corporations in the free market?  If they keep doing things right, then they should get big.  Firms that shouldn't get big can only get big by government protection and subsidies.

&gt;A free market only exists when there are many competing businesses, something that will never happen as long as huge corporations exist.

That is not the definition of a free market.  That is the doctrine of ""pure and perfect competition"", which was thought up by anti-capitalist economists, and, ironically, is not about competition at all but exactly zero competition.

&gt;You seem to be one of the few who think this.

Consensus does not ipso facto mean truth.

&gt;Most people, myself included, see both deregulation and the corporatization of the government as the reasons for the current economic collapse.

Why is ""most people"" the be all and end all?  Most people elected Bush twice.  Most people thought the Earth was flat.  Most people think consumption can cure too much consumption.

The idea that deregulation is the reason for the economic collapse is propounded by those who either do not understand economics, or they have a bias that they want others to believe in order to justify their bias.  The media and the government are trying very hard to spread the myth that laissez-faire capitalism is responsible for the economic collapse.

Nothing could be further from the truth.

The sole source for economic booms and busts is the Federal Reserve, whose existence is a violation of laissez-faire capitalism.  They centrally plan the economy, determining interest rates (and hence the interest rate you pay for on car and student loans), they control the money supply (and hence the purchasing power of money), they determine who gets the money first and who gets it last (and hence determines the rate of wealth transfer from the poor to the rich), they determine whether or not to make or break Presidencies.  They can make a President look great by pumping the economy full of money and causing a boom.  They can make a President look terrible by stopping the pumping and causing a collapse. 

If that doesn't convince you, if you think that economic booms and busts are not monetary but supply related, then you would still be wrong.  In terms of regulations, we have *more* regulations now than ever before.  The Federal Register, which tallies the amount of Federal regulations, now totals in excess of 70,000 pages.  And guess what?  10,000 pages have been added since 1979, the age that the ""most people"" you are talking about attribute as the ""age of Reaganesque deregulation"".

Look at the alphabet soup of regulatory agencies that have been expanded over the years.

Look at the amount of spending that the government's spending now makes up: 40%.  The government used to spend only 11% of total incomes.

Look at the bailouts, the SEC protecting fraudsters, etc etc.

What you need to understand is that regulations are actually designed to protect the established firms whose owners are friends with the politicians, against potential and current competition.  Regulations and big government favor big business over the ""little guy"".

&gt;We look back to other eras where government regulation was minimal or nonexistent, and sure enough, people were exploited and ultimately there was a collapse.

What?  The collapse of 1929 was caused by the Fed pumping in too much credit into the economy.  The Great Depression of the 1930s was caused by FDR and Hoover's spending and economic ""stimulus"" plans.  Go back further.  The collapse of 1921 was caused by the Fed inflating the money supply to pay for WW1 during the 1910s and distorting the structure of the economy.  Go back even further.  The panic of 1819 was caused by the government previously printing money to finance the war of 1812.

You may be ""looking"" at other eras, but you certainly aren't *learning* from other eras.
