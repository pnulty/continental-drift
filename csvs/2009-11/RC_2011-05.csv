**wrong approach.**

you need to choose your destinations wisely. rome and the rest of europe are an awful choice if you're traveling on a budget. why? the euro is slaughtering the dollar, this drives up the price to go to and be in europe (which is also why gas prices are rising, dollar is inflating = oil is priced in dollars = oil drives up cost of flights, anyway...).

want to travel outside of the country? birmingham alabama to cancun is $327. puerto rico is $428. jamaica is $453.

want to stay in the USA? birmingham alabama to miami florida is $237. denver colorado is $239. new york city is $255.

these tickets are on kayak. go to kayak.com/buzz or kayak.com/explore and see for yourself.

here's how you save up to travel if you're tight: create a new bill every month, it's called the travel fund. pay $100 a month into it, don't fuck off, take it seriously and treat it like a car payment or necessary service bill. at the end of the year, you'll have $1200. you can stay in hostels for $15/night around cancun, and eat at taco stands for $2-4 a meal. even if you lived 'well' for a budget traveler, you'd be spending about $35/day which is enough to stay a full month traveling around the east coast of mexico. yea, you might not have all the amenities of the first world, but who gives a shit, [this is your scenery so i think you can deal with a few salty showers](http://i.imgur.com/Qotkn.jpg).

I think it is only discredited if you had some inflated idea of what a social welfare system was supposed to deliver to poor people in the first place.  If on the other hand you view it as only a limited part of government policy as a stopgap measure then it has been as successful as many other government policies aimed at alleviating problems of poverty, that don't attract the same level of distrust.  Long term welfare recipients do fare badly but to suggest that many of these people would be better off without it, especially without spelling out an alternative, is an enormous leap I think.  So that is one criticism you have about the welfare state but the welfare state also works at another level and this is closer to what its core mission was considered to be from the beginnings of modern social welfare as an idea in [Germany and England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare#History) of a national insurance scheme to smooth out the boom and bust cycle that is otherwise a feature of industrial capitalism.  This aspect of the social welfare state is very much relevant today and by way of illustration it is worth noting the difference in emphasis of stimulus spending during the recent GFC where the economists in the United States argued that European governments should increase their stimulus spending or risk stagnation to which the Europeans were able to reply that due to the nature of the welfare states in their various countries, should unemployment start to rise appropriate stimulus money would be automatically directed into the economy in the form of welfare payments directly to those parts of the economy most effected by the slow down.  [Link](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=axtkv3ILIIHI&amp;refer=home)  I don't know of any pieces that point to a more robust economic recovery in the European states as opposed to the USA as a result of the social welfare programs in Europe but it is food for thought isn't it.  Also I am just some idiot with a keyboard but I am pretty confident that my interpretation of this is not unique.  It is with these considerations in mind that we realize that opposition to dismantaling the welfare state in states like Australia and other modern social democratic democracies enjoys broad based support from all level of society poor and rich alike.

It is very difficult to find first hand accounts of the Holocaust, one must rely on very rare public testimony like heroic Katherine Schweitzer provided, or anecdotal evidence as in Moshe Kaplan’s case, one reference was a book maybe by Jersey Kosinski which was the memoir of one of the Jewish guides KS spoke of, who recruited then accompanied the transports of Jews to Auschwitz.

In that book there is an account of Hungarian Jews arriving at the Auschwitz rail head, who made a fuss about porters and such, surely it could have been the Schweitzers.

**This is Holocaust truth**, the Pharisees caused their own people to be gassed in the millions during WW2, the gassings were selective, only some Jews were gassed, witness Moshe Dyan Kaplan’s testimony re his Amsterdam family emerging unscathed, his claim to be a Pharisee, and his contempt for those Jews who were gassed.

&gt;Katherine Schweitzer was a Hungarian Jew the only member of her family to survive the Holocaust, last seen alive in Sydney 22 December 2006, she had gone public in the nineties on the television show Australian 60 Minutes, saying the Jew who arrested her and her family in 1944, had taken up residence on the same street in Sydney.

&gt;30 November 2006, I put her account of her arrest and internment in Auschwitz in a Union email that went world wide to around five thousand e addresses, 28 December 2006 her body was found in a wheelie bin inside her high security apartment!

&gt;Maybe she was murdered by Jew elements in reprisal for telling the truth, to warn any other Jews who want the truth to come out just what the consequences will be, Fritz-Harry Cremer could have talked his way into her apartment and murdered her.

**Ed:** FHC has subsequently denied involvement!

Kaplan was a pilot who had served in the RAAF in WW2, who had known Bomber Harris, the British commander of the air raid on Dresden in 1945 and had flown on that mission, after the war he had flown Lockheed Electras for KLM in Holland, and for Lufthansa. 

&gt;He was the son of a well established Jewish family with antecedents in Johannesburg South Africa, in Amsterdam and in Western Australia, later he was a pilot in New Guinea and dabbled in pawnbroking.

He was the image of the actor who played Emmanuel Goldstein in Michael Radford’s 1984 movie 1984, starring John Hurt and Richard Burton, when I confronted him with that, and asked him how Radford had obtained the footage, and under what circumstances it had been shot, he was unforthcoming.

He told me that after the war he had returned to Amsterdam and took up where he had left off, my response was that it must have been heart rending to go back to Europe, which must have been empty rooms and deserted halls, since Hitler’s men had their way, he said no, that it was good, I said sure, but what about all his friends and rellies, he said they were fine.

&gt;I said that they could not have been fine, since Hitler had the whole lot of them rounded up and sent to Auschwitz, indeed The Diary of Anne Frank, a tale of oppression of Jews by the Nazis was set in Amsterdam. 

&gt;And Stanley Kramer’s great movie Ship of Fools, based on the true story of Jews fleeing the Nazi’s, had its culmination in that city, where the ship finally docked after being turned away from Havana Cuba and from New York, the passengers themselves speedily transported to Auschwitz, gas and death.

&gt;Moshe nodded sagely, he said that my understanding of the Jews was not all that it might be, he told me that he was indeed a Pharisee, and that the Jews of Amsterdam as depicted for instance in The Diary of Anne Frank, were although Jews, not in the same category as him. 

&gt;They were he told me, called Cheesies since their diet consisted largely of that product, and yes they were missing from the community, and that was because they had indeed been gassed, he gave me to understand that as far as he was concerned they were neither missed nor mourned.

Look then at The Holocaust as being a collaboration of high ranking Pharisee Jews, who provided the finance, the uniforms and the marching songs, and the Nazis who would do the dirty work, to reduce the number of those Jews who might if they had the numbers, declare the day of the Pharisee at an end. 

And to clean up any racial minority, or dissident group who were perceived as a threat, or were seen as capable of being a threat some time in the future.

Thus the trade unionists, commos, pamphleteers, whacko’s, crazies, and the lunatic fringe were all bundled in with the Cheesies, Gypsies, Russians and Poles and in Hitler’s words exterminated. After each phase of dirty work proceeded in a master plan devised by the Pharisees, the thugs that had carried the dirty deeds were themselves murdered. 

&gt;Ernst Rohm, murdered with numerous of his thug mates in The Night of the Long Knives massacre in June 1934, was leader of the thug SA movement, the bully boys who did the hands on jobs of thuggery, the scabs of their day.

Witness the 1929 murder of numerous members of the Gasfitters Union in Germany, deeds that were done to empower the Nazis, after they had emerged as a political force with Hitler at their helm in the late 1920’s, murdering, bashing, extorting, and thugging their way along until they were the dominant political force, gaining absolute power in 1933.

&gt;The relationship with Moshe Kaplan had run its course by the mid 1980’s, it was in many ways similar to the relationship between Rod Steiger in the title role, and Jaime Sanchez as Jesus Ortega, in Sydney Lumet’s great 1964 film The Pawnbroker, thus does life imitate art.

They had been the Communist Revolutionaries, who had peacefully made the decision to endorse a Communist government.

&gt;Understand that the land borders between Russia Poland and Germany were only loosely policed, except in time of war, thus political ideals crossed rivers and mountains, so did the Zionists, thus a Yiddish speaking Khazar was equally at home in Poland as in Germany or Russia.

So reading below, Plocker has identified Jews as the most part of the terror in Russia, surely their influence extended as far as Germany. Who funded and planned the vast Nuremburg type rallies held throughout Germany as the Nazis came to power, the whole world was in the grip of a depression so where did the money for the uniforms, and the flags come from.

Jews established and staffed the Secret Police forces who took advantage of the upheavals of the 1917 Russian revolution, who used draconian laws similar to modern US anti terror legislation, that enabled arrests without trial and indefinite detention on anyone they wanted, that caused the millions of deaths blamed on Stalin, Trotsky and Lenin.

**Sever Plocker @ Ynet News**

&gt;The Jews were responsible for both Hitler’s and Stalin’s excesses .. Some of the worst mass murderers in history were Jews …20th of December 1917, in the midst of the Bolshevik revolution and civil war, Lenin signed a decree calling for the establishment of The All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage, also known as Cheka. 

&gt;Within a short period of time, Cheka became the largest and cruelest state security organization. Its organizational structure was changed every few years, as were its names: From Cheka to GPU, later to NKVD, and later to KGB.

&gt;We cannot know with certainty the number of deaths Cheka was responsible for in its various manifestations, but the number is surely at least 20 million, including victims of the forced collectivization, the hunger, large purges, expulsions, banishments, executions, and mass death at Gulags.

&gt;Whole population strata were eliminated: Independent farmers, ethnic minorities, members of the bourgeoisie, senior officers, intellectuals, artists, labor movement activists, “opposition members” who were defined completely randomly, and countless members of the Communist party itself. 

&gt;In his new, highly praised book “The War of the World, “Historian Niall Ferguson writes that no revolution in the history of mankind devoured its children with the same unrestrained appetite as did the Soviet revolution. In his book on the Stalinist purges, Tel Aviv University’s Dr. Igal Halfin writes that Stalinist violence was unique in that it was directed internally.

&gt;Lenin, Stalin, and their successors could not have carried out their deeds without wide-scale cooperation of disciplined “terror officials,” cruel interrogators, snitches, executioners, guards, judges, perverts, and many bleeding hearts who were members of the progressive Western Left and were deceived by the Soviet regime of horror and even provided it with a kosher certificate.

All these things are well-known to some extent or another, even though the former Soviet Union’s archives have not yet been fully opened to the public.

&gt;Who knows about this? Within Russia itself, very few people have been brought to justice for their crimes in the NKVD’s and KGB’s service. The Russian public discourse today completely ignores the question of “How could it have happened to us?” As opposed to Eastern European nations, the Russians did not settle the score with their Stalinist past.

&gt;And us, the Jews? An Israeli student finishes high school without ever hearing the name “Genrikh Yagoda,” the greatest Jewish murderer of the 20th Century, the GPU’s deputy commander and the founder and commander of the NKVD. 

&gt;Yagoda diligently implemented Stalin’s collectivization orders and is responsible for the deaths of at least 10 million people. His Jewish deputies established and managed the Gulag system. After Stalin no longer viewed him favorably, Yagoda was demoted and executed, and was replaced as chief hangman in 1936 by Yezhov, the “bloodthirsty dwarf.”

&gt;Yezhov was not Jewish but was blessed with an active Jewish wife. In his Book “Stalin: Court of the Red Star”, Jewish historian Sebag Montefiore writes that during the darkest period of terror, when the Communist killing machine worked in full force, Stalin was surrounded by beautiful, young Jewish women.

&gt;Stalin’s close associates and loyalists included member of the Central Committee and Politburo Lazar Kaganovich. Montefiore characterizes him as the “first Stalinist” and adds that those starving to death in Ukraine, an unparalleled tragedy in the history of human kind aside from the Nazi horrors and Mao’s terror in China, did not move Kaganovich.

&gt;Many Jews sold their soul to the devil of the Communist revolution and have blood on their hands for eternity. We’ll mention just one more: Leonid Reichman, head of the NKVD’s special department and the organization’s chief interrogator, who was a particularly cruel sadist.

In 1934, according to published statistics, 38.5 percent of those holding the most senior posts in the Soviet security apparatuses were of Jewish origin. 

&gt;They too, of course, were gradually eliminated in the next purges. In a fascinating lecture at a Tel Aviv University convention this week, Dr. Halfin described the waves of soviet terror as a “carnival of mass murder,” “fantasy of purges”, and “essianism of evil.” 

&gt;Turns out that Jews too, when they become captivated by messianic ideology, can become great murderers, among the greatest known by modern history.

&gt;The Jews active in official communist terror apparatuses, in the Soviet Union and abroad and who at times led them, did not do this, obviously, as Jews, but rather, as Stalinists, communists, and “Soviet people.” 

&gt;Therefore, we find it easy to ignore their origin and “play dumb”: What do we have to do with them? But let’s not forget them. My own view is different. 

&gt;I find it unacceptable that a person will be considered a member of the Jewish people when he does great things, but not considered part of our people when he does amazingly despicable things.

Even if we deny it, we cannot escape the Jewishness of “our hangmen,” who served the Red Terror with loyalty and dedication from its establishment. After all, others will always remind us of their origin.” Sever Polker ",0,False,1427108211,t3_h1264,t5_2qh4r,True,conspiracy,0,t1_c1rt3la,

**PNAC and the Proposal to Attack Iran: Operation Barbarossa**

&gt;The same Project for the New American Century rationale that has hyped up the rhetoric for war against Iran, was used in Germany in 1941 to endorse that nation’s invasion of the Soviet Union.

&gt;That attack was sold to the Germans as a campaign to secure Lebensraum, or living space for the sons and daughters of the Nazi inheritance, like the proposed attack on Iran is being sold as a campaign to, “kick their ass …take their gas:.

&gt;The Russian attack was never going to succeed, the Russian Federation extended to the Pacific Ocean, thus in the east, which was out of reach of the Luftwaffe, the Russians could recruit, train and equip the forces they needed to repel the invader, 

Their Western Army which bore the brunt of the Blitzkrieg in defense of their land, though suffering terrible casualties, stalled the German attack and held them at bay long enough to allow their Eastern Forces to prepare for their own offensive.

&gt;“Operation Barbarossa was the codename for Nazi Germany’s invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II that commenced on June 22, 1941. It was the largest invasion in written history. The operation was named after the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa of the Holy Roman Empire, a leader of the Crusades in the 12th century.

&gt;The operational goal of Operation Barbarossa was the rapid conquest of the European part of the Soviet Union, west of a line connecting the cities of Arkhangelsk and Astrakhan, often referred to as the A-A line, at its conclusion in December 1941, the Red Army had repelled the strongest blow of the Wehrmacht.

&gt;Hitler had not achieved the victory he had expected, but the situation of the Soviet Union remained critical. Tactically the Germans had won some resounding victories and occupied some of the most important economical areas of the country, most notably in the Ukraine. Despite these successes, 

The Germans were pushed back from Moscow and were not able to mount an offensive simultaneously along the entire strategic Soviet-German front again.

&gt;The failure of Operation Barbarossa resulted in the eventual defeat of Nazi Germany and is considered a turning point for the Third Reich. Operation Barbarossa opened up the Eastern Front, which ultimately became one of the biggest theaters of war in human history. 

Operation Barbarossa and the areas which fell under it became the site of some of the largest and most brutal battles, deadliest atrocities, terrible loss of life and horrific conditions for the Soviets and Germans alike – all of which influenced the course of both World War II and 20th Century history.” *Wikipedia*

&gt;Contemporary accounts of the Russian Midwinter Offensive which commenced in January 1942, said the Germans could not start the engines on their tanks due to the cold, and they could not believe it when they saw white painted Russian tanks bearing down on their positions.

&gt;The Russian tanks rolled all the way to Berlin, as each phase of the offensive was completed, the units that had been involved, most of which had suffered terrible casualties, were withdrawn and an entirely new army that had been trained similarly in the east, went on to complete the next phase, 

Thus the Soviet forces that took Berlin had similar DNA to the Mongol hordes of Genghis Khan, they were at the entrance to the Fuehrer Bunker in Berlin when AH killed himself.

PNAC and their tool Media Baron Rupert Murdoch know all of this, testimony from Moshe Dyan Kaplan and Katherine Schweitzer …read Roy Luhza, states the Holocaust was an inside job, 

&gt;A plan formulated by Zionist Ashkenazi Jews, who are not Jews at all, they were a tribe of horsemen from Kazakhstan in Central Asia who converted to Judaism en masse in 740 AD, that was to rid Europe of those Jews who opposed Zionism, which had as an aim the illegal, under Jewish law, establishment of the Modern State of Israel.

&gt;Those Jews were financing Hitler and since most media ownership in Germany was Jew owned, it was them who were beating Hitler’s drum more so than anyone else, 

&gt;Keep in mind that persecution of organized labor was the first phase of the Ashkenazi assault, try to find accounts of the 1929 massacre of members of the German Gasfitters Union which left as many as thirty nine dead.

&gt;Now The Ashkenazi in the persons of Wolfowitz, Podhoretz et al who have infiltrated the Washington political establishment and the Pentagon, claim that war against Iran is winnable,

&gt;In the same way their Ashkenazi predecessors in Germany convinced AH the invasion of the Soviet Union would be successful, Podhoretz is on the record stating, “we destroyed the Soviet Union.” They did because they convinced the Russian political establishment to invade Afghanistan… Afghanistan is an unconquerable land, the Soviet invasion of that land killed Soviet Russia.

Israel has been supplying weapons to Iran since the days of Ollie north and Iran Contra, believe that nuclear weapons have been on Iran’s shopping list for as long as Israel has had them for sale.

This is what would happen .. The Iranians nuke the US battle fleets sending them to the bottom, the Turks form a Moslem alliance with all regional Islamic interests including Iran, they unite with the remnants of Saddam’s forces in Iraq, 

The Pakistani’s get rid of Musharraf and join the alliance, the Afghans go on the offensive in that land and suddenly US forces are stranded with no hope of resupply and no way of getting out, they either surrender or are wiped out.

The Ashkenazi offensive on the Homeland commences and the mercenary forces that are already in place on the mainland, round up who they want to and it’s off to the FEMA camps for them for processing… to be killed.

Under PNAC and it’s earlier forerunners America that had no enemies after WW2, has become hated and despised as a bully nation who unleashed CIA terrorists on behalf of the United Fruit Company.

Who waged war on the independent Central American and Caribbean nations since the fifties, coining the term Banana Republics, since The UFC sequestered most of the arable land in those nations and turned it into banana plantations.

&gt;The fruit then being sold cheaply in the US, and exported world wide with no reward to the local inhabitants who were reduced to serfdom.

The fact that Israel and Israeli’s are prominent in PNAC, is because they recognized the vulnerability of the American political system to subversion, they fund the election of traitors who have no qualms about attacking innocent civilian populations with bombs, as long their political tenure is secure.

Then reaping the reward of approval and approbation, from those industrialists who profit enormously from war material contracts, as well as from those persons who find secure employment in the factories and production lines which churn out the same military hardware.

&gt;Similarly it enables the creation of a military caste who remain on the Government payroll for their entire working lives, who are sent to these same foreign lands to wage war on the populace, who have a great time while they are at it, flying about on helicopters, great uniforms, super macho boots… the whole lot.

&gt;The PNAC clones and war profiteers longed for the boom times the knew during WW2, and so far their plans have worked. The traditional middle American is mostly extinct… slain in abortion clinics for the most part, or murdered on the street, or yet in their own homes… tasered and blown to bits by police gunfire.

&gt;Slaughtered in war, or dead from depression unable to comprehend that an Asian for instance from Bombay or New Delhi will be doing his job at work, redundant in his homeland

All the immigrant wants to do to do is get ahead in America he will tell you … what’s wrong with that, he will say. For the fact he lives fourteen to a room when he is doing your job.

For which he is paid only marginally less than the American would have been getting, is as far as he is concerned OK, since his children will be going on to university, who thereafter will be making big bucks, and he can then help Momma and Papa who did it tough as scabs in their early years in America.

&gt;Inevitably these military dictatorships collapse either because they have made so many enemies that they can’t sustain the constant pressure from the dispossessed, as did Germany Jew ridden and severely defeated in WW1 then invaded and occupied after Jews  started WW2.

&gt;It’s menfolk become wasted frozen corpses on the battlefields of Europe, the civilian population incinerated in their homes in deadly bombing campaigns, as thousands of US and British planes bombed that country almost back into the stone age, or more often collapse from within, as the constant jockeying to gain military, political or social rank, brings disruption and civil war.

2. Glyphosate causes significant disruptions to microbial and fungal communities in and on plant tissues, and in soil.  That's what many of the papers I linked document.  They also discuss various adverse plant health effects.

3. One or more species of microbes or fungus is producing a toxin that causes adverse health effects on livestock fed from affected crops; this is detailed in Huber's letters to Vilsak and the EU.

Roundup Ready GMO crops; corn, soy, cotton, and alfalfa were developed by Monsanto.  Glyphosate itself isn't terribly toxic to animals or humans.

This is a bad case of a the human ego where we use identifying factors (age, weight, etc) to evaluate our self worth, when in reality it should really have nothing to do with this. When people evaluate their self worth in terms of physical traits they become offended if they feel like they aren't in the best position. Asians don't seem to be in a constant competition to be better than someone else. This definitely stems from communal traditions.

Here primary, secondary AND university education is free. You wanna be an engineer? You wanna be a doctor? You wanna be a psychologist? You wanna be an artist? You wanna be a lawyer? You only have to pay for books and transportation, for which you can get scholarships and a lot of help. Even second-hand books (I hear they don't let you use second hand books over there in North America). I see a huge difference between us and European/North American countries. I see that some people work before going into college or have to get loans from banks that they pay till their 40's. That's a huge complication. You'll need another loan for a car or a house or a holiday because you can't save up, or at least not much. And if you want to change to another career you have to pay a whole damn lot of money again.

Now this is how's it like for me. I study in the University of Buenos Aires, best college in Argentina. I started a month ago. I just went over to the university, signed up and they told me ""You start the 30th of March"". I started and I spend about $100 (arg pesos) in books. I could have gotten them second hand or for free. Our student council will give us 50% to 100% books for free with no explanation needed (although I think you are required to get involved into political stuff they do, but I guess you can get away with that). If you wanna change, you have to do some small paper work and you're done probably in less than a week, without spending a cent (well maybe books...). The bus probably goes from $1 peso to $20 pesos, depending how far you live. I suggest you translate all that to your currency, I think 4 or 5 pesos is 1 US dollar. There's also free classes you can sign up for for being a student in UBA or wherever you're studying. You can sign up for photography, dancing, acting, whatever! You also have discounts benefits for being students in certain things, but I guess that happens all around the world. There's Private Universities here too, but the ones that are the best and most well known are the public ones. I think you have to pay for doctorates and master degrees, but dammit, you have a degree already so you don't have to be working in McDonald's or Starbucks to save up for it. 

Maybe I'm not well informed and it's not as bad there. But from my point of view, I wouldn't go to college so easily if I had to pay the amount you have to pay for university that Americans/Europeans pay. I would either need scholarships real bad or rich parents. It so much better to have free post-secondary education, a lot of people are able to study. It's a pity most of them go abroad... ._. We have public education here with really good quality. The University of Buenos Aires instructed 5 people who got Nobel prizes. They didn't have to pay huge loans. They only had to sit down and study their asses off because they don't give the title in exchange of money. Please correct me if I'm wrong, I'm just informing you can be a great professional without paying a cent or paying very little in comparison to what other countries pay.

He went against tradition and started holding mass outside. He made a cross out of two sticks and what not. No need for golden figures for him. 

When he became pope he used his new power to help end communism in many countries in europe, mainly Poland. He brought freedom to many people, including my family. 

He was the only pope to travel the amount he did. He tried to get young people involved. He knew how important young people were. Has anyone ever heard of World Youth day?

Ze_Carioca.... easy answer is snow boarding (but the easy counter point is the 2 hour flight to New Zealand)

Yes you can do anything in Australia that you can do in America, but it costs so much more.

It has to do with three major factors.  First Australia is so remote compared to most consumer/western countries  (when flying from Sydney to Europe, Hong Kong is the mid point).  

Secondly there is a small population in Australia so they do not get economies of scale when importing.  

Thirdly, they have a high minimum wage.  Off the bat, it sounds like it would help the low income earners, but it really doesn't.  If the person stocking shelves at the grocery store is getting paid $20 an hour, you're not going to find food for as cheap as if they could pay him 7.50 an hour.  Also clothing is more expensive, and is rent.  Then you look at white collar jobs, well since those are globally competitive, the salary is not pushed up by the high min wage.

By your ""logic"", archaeologically speaking, the people that have the most ""claim"" to that land are the descendants of the first people to settle there from the african migration, so the people that lived there around 70,000 BC.

Could you actually spell out that logic?  You're arguing that the jews displaced from europe by the Germans in the 30s and 40s should, instead of claiming the land their families had before they were displaced, instead move to palestine and displace the Arabs that have lived there in an act of ethnic cleansing mimicing the one that displaced them in europe?

So it's legal for the Jewish state of Israel to give jewish settlers land stolen from Arabs because Israel offered to compensate the Arabs for the land Israel has stolen but the Arabs refused because Israel was committing the war crime of ethnic cleansing, and the Arabs were taking the moral high ground, refusing to accept the money, just like a jewish person displaced from europe wouldn't look kindly on the german government saying ""sorry about stealing your land, we've decided to cleanse the land you ""owned"" as part of out overall plan to clear the area of your race entirely, how about you take some bribe money to whitewash our war crime?""

Simon Wiesenthal was responsible for an incredible number of distortions in all of his testimony - he was among the most notorious of the witnesses with erroneous or fabricated testimony, next to Elie Wiesel and Yankel Wiernick (sp?).  a quick search reveals several pages confirming this:

elgordo78,4,False,1304221708,c1rtlb9,,0,,4,t1_c1rtd9j,"The cheap helmet will be legal, as I mentioned. This intimates that it passes the same tests - and indeed it has. 

So in legal terms, they're as good as each other. However in real world terms, this is rarely true.

Beyond that I will say this...

The helmets have passed the same tests of legal minimum protection. This much is of course true. However, 3rd party independent tests performed by magazines and charities that deal with brain and spinal cord injury have shown time and again, over and over, that there is SOME correlation between cost and protection TO A POINT. 

This is to say in performing their own tests that exceed the legal minimum For example one test requires a rounded metal die (or 'anvil') be dropped under simple gravitational force at a number of pre-determined points on a helmet, a prescribed number of times with reducing energy in 2nd and 3rd impacts. It allows replacement of helmet between testing different impact rather than using the same helmet, and reduces energy of the die if the impact is in an area less likely to receive a severe blow, and so on). Many tests only require a manufacturer to provide a median shell size (size medium) but allow them to produce multiple shell sizes for retail manufacture so the potential for a larger shell to fail to distribute the load of an impact may differ negatively, for example, but some tests don't require this to be put to proof. These tests are not incredibly realistic.

The independent tests I've alluded to will always try to be far more rigorous in order to expose weaker helmets. They'll use things like shaped dies based on the shape of a part of a production car or truck or bus, or road furniture (sign posts, armco, etc) dropped at random points rather than the simple rounded dies set on pre-determined points, and sometimes accelerating these shaped dies beyond mere gravitational drop too. 

They will use other non-standard tests such as penetration testing where a pointed die is dropped. They use kerb-stones and flat areas to hit and re-hit the same spot as if tumbling or bouncing down a tarmacked road. They will use compression tests to simulate being run over by large goods vehicles, and so on and so forth.

Independent tests have found that many cheaper helmets will pass the basic legal requirements, but often fail to take the abuse of more real-world incidents, and worst-case scenario tests (like the penetration with a pointed object), and often fail at points in between those points that are pre-determined impact sites to pass testing. More expensive helmets tend to have had more research time put into them, more extensive histories from their manufacturers of producing high quality helmets, and so on.

So the correlation exists, BUT it's not a set rule that is 100% guaranteed. 

Every year these tests occur there are exceptions. For example last year I recall reading such an article and while the most expensive helmets performed admirably, a Shark helmet that was less than half the price of a Shoei (£119 to £249) excelled above all comers. 
However the lowest rated helmet was made by a company/brand called ""LID"". It had the EU rating and was ACU gold marked which means you're allowed to wear it to race in. The retail price was under £50. It failed to get even one star in their ratings test, after cracking clean open across the point where the chin bar part became part the rest of the helmet (full face helmet) - and this occurred on only the third impact. 

Yes, you can (as I indicate above) get an awesome helmet for a very good price. I'll readily admit that. 

But unless you can find a long list of every helmet and every test they've been subjected to by every magazine and charity with resulting performance scales, the easiest way is to try and work on the rule-of-thumb, time-told, more-often-than-not basis that *usually* a little bit more money very often means a lot more quality. 


You can get the more expensive helmet produced by a more established and reputable company, with their billions of yen and euros and dollars of research institutes and experience racing, with decades of knowledge of what happens in accidents and designing helmets to protect the rider against them and their reputation for saving lives in extreme conditions, and will not release a poor product to market - or buy something from a 5 year old company who have reverse-engineered a more expensive helmet, downgraded many points to reduce machining costs and materials, and produce a helmet for the budget market that is designed to meet the letter of the law and not a lot else. 

It's not 100% perfect, and there may be a better product for less money, but if you can afford to stretch a $75 budget to $175 you'd be a fool to yourself not to, regardless of whether two helmets carry the same safety stickers.


Now, to the real-world issue of actually paying up for these things.

Bear in mind SOME of the price of the very most expensive helmets usually comes from race-replica paint-jobs, so that's why I say get out of season ones (where a racer has a new design, or the paint job is no longer manufactured) because then you save yourself the fluff and glamour money from your purchase. 


Shop wisely and with some luck you can get that $550 helmet for $99, because it's got an out of date GSXR design on it and the fashion-conscious posers who normally shell out every penny right away to have a helmet to match their bike won't touch it any more.",0,False,1427108447,t3_h15cs,t5_2qi6d,True,motorcycles,0,t1_c1rtlb9,

The casting team? Alright. I don't rate Gretorp and iNcontroL that hugely but they're doing an alright job.

The free stream quality? Shite. I dunno whether it's due to justin.tv being a terrible site for European audiences or a problem on the NASL's side but I've often watched matches both at 2AM GMT and at 6PM GMT (the time of the restream because I'm often not up late enough to watch the entirety of it) and watched as choppiness, stream lag, and even full minutes where the stream would buffer fucking RealPlayer style just ruined the quality.

The price. Maybe $25 is a good price for a tournament as big as the NASL for VODs and a decent quality stream but I refuse to pay that for several reasons:

* IGN and Dreamhack provide VODs for free even if they're ad supported. Why should I pay for the North American Star League when other (slightly smaller scale) tournaments release their VODs for free, and in the days where other better casters like Husky, TotalBiscuit, Moletrap, X, TMStarcraft, HD, Crota etc do YouTube commentary videos for free but ad supported?
* The production quality of the NASL is questionable considering its budget, and clearly they had a pretty good budget considering the prize pool!
* They can't even get their free stream working. It's worse than the one for fucking MLG Dallas, and that was a TERRIBLE stream. Why should I have to pay $25 for a stream which may not even work on my end considering I'm in Britain and the free stream is almost non-functional at times.
* They don't provide replays, something which Dreamhack has already beaten them (and the GSL and possibly IGN) on.
* I think of all the things to spend $25 on, a pass to watch Starcraft II matches don't seem like the best thing to spend it on.
* Considering my current PC specs, a 1080p stream would be laggy for me.

The site for EU viewers is hardly spoiler free when the restream is on. Unfortunately, that and the Liquibets system on TeamLiquid is probably the only (free) way I can find out the results because of how bad the free stream is, as I said before.

Don't get me wrong, I think ad revenue must be shite if the NASL and GSL must resort to making VODs and a HD stream a premium feature, I'm just giving my two pence on the issue here and why I don't plan to directly be a customer. I understand I will get a lot of downvotes from people saying ""Fuck you, heretic. You clearly hate e-sports if you are refusing to pay for such a huge and significant event and let e-sports flourish in the West as a result."" In that case, I honestly do not give a shit.

In places where cows were raised and cow's milk was part of the diet, lactose intolerance is as low as 5%.  That's how evolution works. 

In a civilization that raises cows, there's an inherent benefit for people that are able to digest cow's milk (hence the Swedes and, really, most of Europe). Raising cows takes a lot of land and it's expensive, so benefiting from that really requires being able to get as much out of the cow as you can.

Goddamn it I wish I could upvote you 5 times for saying that.

&gt; Valve has been very smart about not doing this, they spent a lot of money on half-life2, but most of that money was used to develop the source engine which they can sell to other companies and they can use to strengthen steam.

Not only that, they intentionally made the source engine modular so that they can continue to build on it easily. Gotta say they did a damn great job, it may not be the best looking engines but considering that it's coming on a decade in age it looks pretty damn good and a hell of a lot better than homefront does. Also they know how to animate.

&gt; It still costs quite a bit for a license, and they still need to support the software as DRM often causes complex and hard to fix bugs. Companies like Sony often do develop DRM in house.

Which is true but is still puzzling considering that if they hope to make any sales in the North American and European markets they are going to have to release on steam and they could just use valve's protection and in Asia it doesn't matter because piracy is so rampant there that you aren't going to get any money anyways.

On the bus ride from orientation to the airport I sat down next to a beautiful young woman and we had a long, relaxed conversation. We were enough at ease with each other that we hung out whenever we got tired of mingling with the other trainees. Within the first week the chemistry was strong enough that we started dating. We were lucky enough to be posted in the same region for the next two years so the relationship continued, getting progressively deeper and better.

We finished our service, spent a month in Europe (which for us was even more wonderful than all of those romantic comedies make it out to be), then came back to the states and found an abandoned little cottage that we could fix up for ourselves.

[deleted],1,True,1304226632,c1rtwrx,,0,,1,t1_c1rszjn,"&gt;I just get really disheartened when I see Libertarians slamming Progressives instead of working with them; which happens quite a bit in /r/libertarian. 

I know the feeling.  We Libertarians get really disheartened when we see Progressives respecting peace only part of the time, rather than all of the time.  When some Libertarians converse with Progressives, and see Progressives refusing to work with their fellow mankind peacefully, and instead see them advocating for involuntary, compulsory, ""do this or else you will be sent to prison"" solutions to various complex social problems, I think you can hopefully understand why Progressives get slammed by Libertarians.

Libertarians and Progressives can get along perfectly fine when it comes to civil matters.  Ending the drug war, defending gay marriage, pro-choice, ""live and let live"" mentality, etc.

But when it comes to economic matters, Libertarians are disheartened to see Progressives ""turn to the dark side"" so to speak.  When a typical Libertarian and a Progressive are sitting in a park together on a bench having a chat, I don't think either of them will think that if they have a disagreement about something, that either of them will pull out a gun and point it at the other person and say ""Agree with me and do what I say or else.""  Well, unless of course they disagree with each other on whether one of them has the right to hit the other over the head.  In those kinds of disagreements, the context of peace is already lost.  In all other disagreements, I think neither will threaten the other with violence if there is disagreement.

But the Libertarian always sees Progressives calling for exactly that all the friggin time from the government.  From roads, to education, to healthcare, to welfare and social security, the Progressive goes from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde.  He/she goes from recoiling at the thought of pulling out a gun at the Libertarian on the park bench, to advocating for others, in government, who have guns, to do just that to the Libertarian.  The Progressive says to the Libertarian ""I won't be evil and point a gun at you to get what I want from you.  But I will advocate for others to point a gun at you so that you will obey and accommodate my desire to enact X, where X = government financed education, or healthcare, or welfare, etc.""

If you asked me, I think most Libertarians are not harsh to the Progressive enough.  Here the Progressives are supporting and calling for guns to be pointed at Libertarians so that the Progressive economic plans can be enacted.  Do you have any heart at all?  Do you have any idea how evil it is deep down?  Sure, you might think that the end goal is moral and good.  After all, who WOULDN'T want all children to receive a half decent education, who WOULDN'T want the elderly to be ensured that they are taken care of in their state of relative weakness and need?  Who in their right mind would be *against* this?

The Libertarian is not against any of these goals.  What the Libertarian is against is pointing guns at people as a means to get to those goals.  The Progressive has no problems pointing guns at people to achieve these goals.  When they see Libertarians object to these economic plans, they almost always interpret this rejection as the Libertarian being somehow against the idea of educating children, or helping the elderly.  But that is just a reflection of the Progressive's inability, or unwillingess, to accept and understand peaceful solutions.

If I pointed a gun at you, and demanded that you give me your money or else I'll shoot you, and I say to you that I am going to use your money to help finance the construction of a school for blind children, then my guess is that you will object to my actions.  Not because you're against helping blind children, but because you are against people pointing a gun at you and stealing from you.  Suppose you did tell me that pointing a gun at you and stealing from you is wrong.  Would it make any sense for me to then say to you ""OMG, I can't believe this.  You are actually against helping blind children!  How heartless can you get???!!?  You're selfish! Cold hearted! Greedy! etc, etc, etc.""

The Libertarian just wants people to put their guns away, and only pull them out for one reason and one reason only: Only when some violent asshole pulls his out first to be used as offense.  The Libertarian wants guns to be used as a defense only, and not as an offense like the Progressive does when it comes to the government's guns.

The government is not an institution that takes care of people.  At most, AT MOST, the only legitimate action of the government is to use its guns as a defense only.  The police to protect individuals from initiations of violence at home, and the military to protect individuals from initiations of violence from abroad.  Anything more than that, and the government is doing exactly what it is supposed to stop, namely initiations of violence.

The founders established a government in this country for the purposes of defense against violence.  They were wrong of course, but not because a government is supposed to do more than just defend, but also house, educate and provide social security to people, but rather they were wrong because the very formation of the state was a violation of individual rights for those who were living there already in peace and did not want to join the state system of taxation and protection.  Because the very formation of the state was an initiation of violence, the founders creation of a minarchist state, was doomed to keep growing as subsequent generations kept coming up with new uses of government violence.  Instead of just defense and protection, and the necessary minimal individual rights violations that is implied by minarchist states, Progressives relentlessly demanded, and succeeding in getting, the state to increase its offensive violence against the American population itself, in the name of helping it.  Instead of advocating for peaceful methods to solve complex social problems, the Progressives advocated for violent methods.  Their advocacy of state violence was due to the philosophical influence of socialism coming from Europe.  Marxism was a huge influence all over the world, and succeeded in establishing Communism in the 20th century in eastern Europe, Asia, and South America.  It even succeeded in establishing social security, medicare and medicaid, and centralized banking in the US.  The conflict between communism and capitalism is irreconcilable, because when it comes to ownership of physical resources, there is only one alternative.  Either the population owns the means of production on behalf of the individual in a dispersed fashion (capitalism), or the government owns the means of production on behalf of all (communism).

The solution in the US was to adopt a ""middle of the road"" policy.  Free market capitalism combined with centrally planned communism.  Central banking in this country, and almost all other countries, is communist.  Whenever the government has a monopoly on any production, it is communist.  Central banking is communist production of money.  

When the Libertarian sees Progressives calling for government to solve every social problem that arises, they vehemently defend against it, because the Libertarian doesn't want violence to be used as the solution.  Violence simply does not solve the myriad of complex social problems that arise in human life.

The Progressive deserves all the harsh words they receive from Libertarians, because harsh words of violence advocacy are coming from the Progressives.  Of course they dress up the harshness with euphemisms and Orwellian catch phrases.  The Libertarian is direct, and will not tolerate such touchy feely emotionally laden kind words that in reality have vicious actions backing it.",0,False,1427108595,t3_gznoy,t5_2cneq,True,politics,0,t1_c1rtwrx,

BSI and EC tests are a standard requirement for any helmet to go to market here, and they have the right to test random helmets from any given batch from any given manufacturer on demand. Any fail means a whole batch gets failed and must be destroyed. It's stringent stuff so there's no ""sticker slapping"" - apart from the ACU (auto cycle union) who dictate what can and can't be worn to race in. They effectively say if it's passed BSI then it gets a gold sticker regardless of a marginal-pass or strong-pass. It's illegal to sell a non-qualifying helmet as anything other than a fashion, show, or display item only, and if wearing one on the road is classed as not wearing a helmet at all and you can be prosecuted. That said, a cop is unlikely to ticket someone for wearing a Simpson or Bell (though it's not unheard of).

And FWIW there are numerous helmets that pass DOT which don't make it past EC and BSI tests by a long chalk, and vice versa.

Some are worth seeing (Temple of Heaven, Forbidden City), other places are not (Houhai hutongs). I'm assuming since you're on r/travel, you want to see the ""real"" side of a city, and not the touristy bullshit people usually do:

    Roast Duck:

Someone will drag you to a roast duck restaurant. It's absolutely delicious, and there are a few places that do it well. The one all the foreigners (and people from China) go to is ""Quan Jude"". The most famous one. However, all the native Beijingers know that ""Da Zhong"" is the best roast duck in Beijing. A well-kept secret.

For another shop, ""Bian Yifang"", the oldest roast duck place (est. 1416) and is steeped in tradition.

    Bars:

The common bar street is ""Sanlitun"" close to the Embassy district (I think it's actually located in Chaoyang district), but the best bar street is in ""Houhai"". It's a series of 2-3 interconnected lakes in the middle of the city, very close to the main street (Chang'an). You can rent a electric boat for cheap, and drink your night away either on the boat, or one of the many bars that line the sides of the lakes.

I don't go out much in Beijing as I'm usually with family. But the good bar districts are in Chaoyang and Dongcheng. Both are heavily Westernized and by no means cheap.

    Art:

This area I don't know too much about. However, there is a street specializing in traditional Chinese art and calligraphy somewhere close to one of the 8 Quanjude locations in Beijing. I went there with my grandfather to get a calligraphy piece framed. Also not a tourist trap and primarily serves Chinese artists and hobbists. The pieces here are fairly certain to be done by hand. Whereas if you buy art in a tourist district, it will be a reprint, but for much cheaper. If that's what you're looking for. See below:

    Knockoffs:

Two are the most famous. The first is ""Yaxiu"" in the embassy district. The second is ""Xiu Shui Jie"" in Chaoyang district.

The latter is easier to get to as there is a subway station directly connected to it. The station is either ""Yong Anli"" or ""Da Wanglu"", I can't remember, but both of them are on the main line (the one that runs in front of Tiananmen square).

Personally, I think Xiu Shui Jie is much better. Prices are bargainable, but don't go on weekends (more people, means less prices for you). You'll get outrageous prices as a foreigner, but take it from a local:

T-Shirts: 30-40 yuan Button up shirts: 40-60 yuan Hats: 20-30 yuan

Buy in bulk to get a better price.

Another one is ""Tianyi"" for small knicknacks, curiosities, and just fun little things. I love this place.

    Food:

Beijing specializes in Northern cuisine, particularly influenced by Shandong and the N. Eastern styles. Imperial cuisine is large too, but I think you would be lost trying to order it. Northern China is fairly conservative in terms of cuisine, and you'll rarely find anything besides beef, pork, chicken, or lamb on the menu.

Things to try:

   1.

      Zha Jiang Mian: Speciality of Beijing. There's a place called ""Lao Beijing Zha Jiang Mein"" that makes a mean bowl. They're franchised so you can find it.
   2.

      Yoshinoya: Not Chinese, but a Japanese franchise. They have an AMAZING beef and rice bowl. Definitely should try.
   3.

      La Mian: Hand-made noodles. Very cheap. Try this at a mall foodcourt (Da Pai Dang).
   4.

      Street food: Found behind Wangujing in the Dongcheng district at night. A bustling street food market that's sanitary (that have operating permits as opposed to vendors off the street), delicious, and includes a mammoth amount of variety. You can avoid Wangfujin during the day unless you want to buy expensive watches and clothes. Not worth seeing as a tourist in my opinion, no different than any other shopping area in the world. On the flip side, China's first McDonalds opened here.

Try the ""Yang rou chuan"" or Lamb-Skewers. Brought in by the Uighurs from Western China, it is absolutely fucking amazing. For a few bucks, you can get 4-5 skewers, the classic Beijing street food. Other Bejing classics are ""Tang Hulu"" or candied-apples.

   1. Hotpot: OMFG good. Get platefuls of meat and throw them in the boiling broth for 10-20 seconds to cook it. Immediately dip in the mandatory peanut sauce. Heaven in a mouthful.

Go to the franchise ""Xiabu Xiabu"". It's a Taiwanese franchise, but they have very fresh cuts of uber-thin sliced beef, pork and a ton of other stuff. Impeccably clean and great service. Going close to lunch or dinner will almost certainly involve a wait, especially in the winter.

I also recommend the Vermicelli (very common in Beijing) and a ""shao bin"" (a chinese pancake) to make sandwiches with your freshly cooked beef. Ask for the pepper oil to add a kick.

   1. Other: Baozi (Gou Buli is AMAZING), jiaozi (find a dumpling restaurant. Classic Northern Chinese fillings are pork + lettuce, pork + jiucai (garlic chives, chinese leeks, this is most authentic filling), pork + leaf mustard.

Any mall food-court. The better mall food courts are Sogou, Golden Resources Mall (4th ring), Chang'an (they have both a Yoshinoya AND a Xiabu Xiabu. A huge dilemma for me everytime).

    Hutongs

Hutongs are small and narrow alleyways that represent ""Old-Beijing"". Most of them have been demolished to make way for high-rises, mainly because a ""classic"" hutong has a square courtyard in the middle, and the bedrooms surrounding it. The high population density of Beijing doesn't allow for this anymore.

The ones near Houhai are almost certainly tourist traps. Companies run rickshaw companies to take tourists in. Not authentic at all. However, some families in order to capitalize on this trend, open up their homes to the public, of course for a fee. If you actually want to see what one looks like on the inside, you'll have to go this route.

If not, rent a bicycle and visit the hutongs in ""Xidan"". A beautiful and old neighborhood in it's own right, the hutongs here are much less well-known. The good thing about these, is that they are 100% authentic. No tourist bullshit, and the people who live here are ""real"" people and not rich guys buying the ultra-expensive hutongs near Houhai. Most of them are scheduled to be demolished, but its been over 20 years, and still no movement to do so. Nonetheless, visit them before they're gone forever.

    Other things to do:

Get a massage. A real one, not the one you're thinking of you horny bastard. It's a lot cheaper than the US, and it'll make you feel hella good.

There's a massage parlor I usually go to in the Chaoyang district in a hotel. It's very close to the Kerry center, but they offer all you can eat snacks and noodles while you get your massage, a double win. Most nice hotels will all have this service, again, for much cheaper than the US. Feel free to look around

Go the summer palace. It's not too far away from the center of the city, a 50-60 yuan cab ride. Still within the 4th ring road, so still considered part of the city now. It's absolutely gorgeous, if you have time, wander around the Long Corridor. Containing 14,000 pieces of art adorned upon each doorway. The art series tell famous stories and events in Chinese literature. From ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" to ""The Dream of Red Mansions"". Commissioned in 1750, it is both historic, and absolutely gorgeous.

The Old Summer Palace. This is in the middle of the city. The Europeans burned it down during the retaliation for the Boxer Rebellion. It's an extremely cool park, and also very eerie at night due to the burnt down ruins that have been allowed. It's a good place to go to in order to understand the current psyche of China, a reminder of the bullying China withstood in the early-1900's. They don't call it a ""hundred years of shame"" for nothing.

The CCTV tower is the tallest building in Beijing. Has a rotating, buffet-style restaurant in the middle (the buffet is EXCELLENT), and offers gorgeous, 360 views of Beijing. Close to Chang'an jie, so it's smackdab in the middle of the city.

For electronics, then Zhong guan cun. Termed the ""silicon-valley"" of China, its an extremely dense block with high-rises chocked full of electronics (10 stories of small shops set up flea market style). If you're a tech geek, you'll be blown away. Think Newegg... but in person. Prices also bargainable, but not much cheaper than the US. Don't come here expecting to get a deal on anything besides memory (flash or otherwise).

Man, there's so much I can tell you. What are you interested in? Do you wear glasses? Go to ""Pan Jia Yuan"", I get glasses in China all the time. Got my last pair over 2 years ago there, quality is great and they'll match your prescription. Might as well go to the source, all the glasses in Wal-Mart and Pearl Vision and exported from China anyways. You can get a nice pair of glasses in Beijing for about... 40-50USD per pair. Buy more and the price drops more. 

For traveling. During the peak times, subway is the fastest. Prepare to get crushed though. They are VERY full during rush hour. Taxis are cheap, usually 2.00 yuan per kilometer. A ride from the airport to the city is about the most expensive ride you'll have, roughly 130 yuan (20 dollars). A ride from most places in the city is about 60-80 yuan at most (just over 13 dollars).

Lastly, Beijing is HUGE, with a population of 16-17 million (officially only 12 million based on ""hukou"", but the reality is much higher). There's so much to do in this town that's is absolutely amazing. Trendiest districts are the Chaoyang, Dongcheng. Xicheng for history. Haidian for the electronics and for the ""new"" Beijing.

As I aged, the back of the truck became increasingly packed with uniformed men, young and old, sombre-faced and resigned to some miserable fate. This detail seemed to coincide with the increasing frequency of explosions and violence in the scenery/background of the dream.

Us analysts are split into teams, with each team assigned a specific area of the globe.

And I just replied back to that guy he said he lost people in WWII and I said we as Iranians have lost some too. I did not equate it to the numbers of Jews lost. 

Is the holocaust in question the use of gas chambers? No. it's a genocide. I am no denying the death of 6 million Jews. I am re-visioning the method in which it was done. That is not Holocaust denial, that is Gas chambers in the camps denial. There should be more research on it because things don't add up:
for example there are blue stains all over the camps and the delousing chambers from Zyklon B and none in the actual damn chamber: Why? Is it so wrong to ask why? Well you could say the soviets rebuilt it after it was destroyed by the Germans but you must remember Stalin's propaganda was very strong and the soviets could've built anything to demoralize the Germans. Of-course i am not completely DEVOTED to this, I just bring this up as a possibility and it might as well be wrong. It's a hypothesis. 
I am being called a racist and people are threatening my death. You cannot say that's not ignorance with a straight face. I have not said anything racist. 

A note on homogeneous societies. Homogeneous as in culturally homogeneous not racially. For example a big problem in Europe today is are the immigrants who are not willing to fit in with the culture and language of the European countries they settle in. This is ok in countries like Canada and the US which were founded on multiculturalism but for Germany FOR EXAMPLE or Japan which have had a long rich history and their traditions that developed over hundreds, perhaps thousands of years, it does not seem fair to have it suddenly diluted due to globalism. Japan does not allow immigrants unless they're married to a Japanese person etc. I am NOT SAYING immigrants are bad. NO. I am saying they should mix in with the culture of the country they have decided to settle in. That's why I believe homogeneous society in that sense is good. 
National Socialism promoted a homogeneous society (albeit in a different way). It was one people working together for a common goal and you cannot deny that it wasn't working well until everything got fucked over in late 1939. Clean streets, low crime rate, high employment. I think Nationalism in that sense did good for Germany in the 30s. 

I completely slam the De-Nazification and the collective guilt process. I believe it is BECAUSE of this that today we have Neo Nazi groups. Making the Nazi era a symbol of hatred towards coloured races created the Neo Nazi groups. People who were racist regardless of what happened to Germany from 1933 to 1945 but using the symbols from that era as portrayed in the news, media etc. to create these Neo Nazi groups.

devedander,0,True,1304233861,c1ruaed,,0,,0,t1_c1ru7rc,"&gt;This is wrong on so many levels. A store never has half of their lanes open, even the day before Thanksgiving. Self-checkout lanes replace normal lanes at a 1:1 ratio. Self-checkouts take more time than a cashier. People never choose self-checkouts over a cashier.

This is wrong on an aboslute level.  You said never.  Unfortunately in any logic or debate course they will teach you aboslutes make your argument all but useless because it's almost certain at least one exception will be found which then makes you wrong.

To be precies many grocery stores around me regularly have half their lines open (and saldy those lines often have more than 3 people per). 

I don't know where you are from, but in my city there are 3 Safeways and 2 Lucky's that make up pretty much all the major grocery store options.

On any given day, during normal busy hours (lunch and around 5PM) you will find at least half the lies open and usually most of the lines open.

So right there you are wrong.  Let me ask you the obvoius question: In a world with margins as tight as grocery - how do you figuer most (let alone EVERY) store decides to build SO MANY lines that they never need more than half open - even the day before thanksgiving?  Stop and think about that for a second... does that sound likely let alone plausible?  That EVERY store would, during planning, decide they expect to need 5 lines, so build 15 just for the heck of it resulting in never opening more than half?  Because that is precisely what would have to happen to make your statement that no store every has more than half it's lines open at any given time.

Next self checkouts do not replace regular checks at 1:1.

Again I know this because 3 of my local groceries have self checkout sections that were added in the last few years.  In all of them 2 regular checkoutlines were removed and a 4 pack of self checks put in.  These have 1 cashier watching over them. 

Here they have actually packed 6 into the space of 2 checkout lines, in my area we only have 2 on each side http://www.aimlessfury.com/pics/self-checkout-station.jpg

So wrong again - self checks (at least around me) tend to fit about 2 times as many registers in the same space.

Lastly again must be your area, but around me, people OFTEN choose a self check.  I certainly do and you can often see people in line for self check 3 or 4 deep. 

Of course if there is an EMPTY full service cashier, usually people would do that, but even then not always.  I personally will use a self check for a quick and easy item simply because I have yet to run into a self check isle that makes me stand there for 3 minutes while changing the ribbon, exchanging cash drawers or chatting with another employee (either about busines or personal issues).

Add to this I have seen a few (admittedly rare times) when cahsiers are standing at the head of their empty check lines ready to get customers and people just heading right to the self checks.

So wrong again.

&gt;Even though this is never the case, let's go with your figures.

I said it was for easy math.  The point is that unless a self check is MUCH slower than a regular checkout, it will cost jobs.  To be precise: If one person can monitor 4 self checks, the self check method must be 4 times slower to not cost jobs.  That time has to include the oddities like food stamps/WIC, Checks (that self check doesn't take as far as I know) gettings cigarettes from the cage (which adds a full minute onto a checkout easily) etc.  

There are of course cases where cashiers are faster - produce being the obvious.  But then it's balanced out by the fact you will never be heald up waiting for someone to grab cigarettes from the cage in a self check line or have to wait for food stamps/WIC to be used in a self check line.

&gt;Assuming people will do self-checkout first (which, again, is never the case), each one does 40 people per hour. That leaves 520 people to go through the normal cashier lines. This means you need nine other cashiers. Therefore, no jobs lost.

I don't get your math... you said that 1 person can watch over 5 self checks (I said 4 which is favorable to your argument so lets go with 4) at 40 per hour, that is 160 patrons.  Of the 600 that leaves 440 to serve. 

440 patrons can be served at 1 minute a piece by 7.3 cashiers.  Round that up to 8 if you like and you are still down one full cashier.  More than likely management would round that down to 7 and expect those 7 to just be a little faster thus 2 jobs. 

Think about this - why would stores spend money on self checks if it doens't save them on employee costs?  Self checks cost to install, cost to train on and open you up to theft and abuse (people can just lie about produce numbers and or just pocket stuff)?  

I garauntee you that when the store was sold self check machines, some math like we just went thorugh was used to show how they could cut so much staff that the self checks would pay for themselves and probably actually come out ahead.

&gt;I wouldn't accept this argument (or yours for that matter) because the figures are nowhere near realistic. The store is never taking in a constant number of people per hour, checkout time varies greatly from customer to customer, and cashiers are supposed to have a ton of downtime.

You are right... the number are far to sterile and even for a real store... unfrotunately fluctuating numbers make an argument for self checks instead of cashiers. 

Think about it -  every full service line with a cashier can handle one lines worth of people.  If it gets busier, that one cashier cannot suddenly man two stations.

Now take a self check where one cashier can handle 4 stations.  

If it's dead you are still only paying one cashier to do nothing, same in both circumstances.

However if it gets bumping, you will have to bring on another few cashiers to help that one single full service cashier. 

However the one cashier watching the self check lines is probably doing fine with 4 (or 5) people moving through the lines. 

Your own point works against you.

As for down time, I don't know what stores or managers you have but I have NEVER seen ANY business where the employees are supposed to have a lot of downtime.  In a business like grocery I absolutely do not believe any manager stays in business by ""expecting a lot of downtime""

In every store around me if you are not actively checking, you go back to stocking, facing, inventory, cleaning... something... there is always more work than there are people.  You will  NEVER see more than 1 cashier idle.  If your line is empty, you lock your terminal and go do something until the remaining lines call for backup cashiers. 

During slow periods you wlil actually see NO lines staffed and a bell to ring when you are ready to check out.  One cashier will stock/face/inventory near that line and be ready to come when you ring the bell. 

If you have a grocery store where there are every more than 1 idle cashier for any period of time, you are either paying very high markups (to cover labor) or that store is shutting down soon (or maybe a money laundering front).

&gt;The store has a minimum number of cashiers that need to be employed at a time, and the union demands that each cashier be given a minimum number of hours every week. For every person watching self-checkout, the wait of the customer greatly decreases.

Having serveral friends who work grocery I can tell you that minimum staffing is decided by estimated customer load for a given day and shift.  And I can also tell you that basically the store staffs as most of their staff can do an entire 8 hour stock job and somehow magically cover a retigster occasionally in an 8 hour shift.   And by occasionally I mean really it turns out to be 1 or 2 hours of cashier.

They are constantly running and constantly running out of time to finish their duties and OT is surprisngly common due to this. 

This is why you never see cashiers idle - becuase they are not really cashiers, they are stockers who have taken time out to run a register and are need to get back to their job ASAP or they will run OT.

&gt;I honestly don't get why this isn't totally obvious to everyone or why my previous explanation didn't totally cover the concept.

I can only guess you live in an area where the stores run nothing like the ones in most major cities in California, the countires I have been to in Europe or China. 

Seriously - where do you live?  I am curiuos where they swap out full serve to self serve check lines 1:1 and cashiers are epxected to have lots of downtime...

Your logic only works if in your location they really do replace full service isles with 1 self check isle (and then I don't get how one person can monitor 5 as they are pretty spread out).  

Tell you what - you take a picture of this store of yours where one regular lane was replaced with one self service lane (like that one I posted above which was just from somewebsite) around noon on a normal day showing less than half their lines open.  If you can do that, I will believe you were at least just a victim of circumstance (although still shouldn't have clamed that it's true always since you can't know that).",0,False,1427108772,t3_h0z6i,t5_6,True,reddit.com,0,t1_c1ruaed,

American cities are built to create profit. 

European cities were built around town squares and public transport  comes within a few blocks of anyone's home within city limits. The other big difference in the function of a Euro city compared to an American one is that Europe allows for dual use of buildings. Meaning that there can be shops on the ground level and then above that you have apartments. In the US this is generally only allowed in historical districts. The best way to zone a large piece of land in the us is get the zoning commission (who if you notice are all generally land developers as well)  to zone an entire field as commercial, or residential. And then take take connector roads back to the main highway. That's it. That's the integration that most developments have in the US. This started in the 50s, and before that American cities were built in a similar way to European ones. Mainly having a town square, schools, a downtown, and dual zoned spaces all mixed together. Believe it or not, if you look at the old developments in the US from the 1920s and 30s they actually mixed income levels in terms of the housing that was built as well. So you would see a large home right next door to a more modest home. This would never happen today as every entire suburb is supposed to conform to people of the same income. The garage was moved to the front of the house and became the main feature to the outside world. While the  backyard became the focus. So American architectural styles moved away from having porches, and sidewalks to larger backyards and fences. The goal being to interact with as few people as possible.

and don't get me started on how the housing industry actually bears a ton of responsibility for the global economic crisis. But here's a hint. developments with no connection to the outside world aren't really worth that much if no one lives there.

They support yet contradict each other somewhat, but provide a good perspective from both sides.

While you may be right saying a crash would take me out, im betting that the crash you are worried about is still a couple years down the road. I think more people will hop on the bandwagon first before we start seeing people jumping out. Hopefully, i will be smart enough to be out long before we reach the top

Until supply is addressed, the dollar (and other world currencies) starts to regain its value, and interest rates rise, there is no reason to be bearish on silver. I understand that I am betting against the US govt, and that they have many tricks up there sleeve and wont go down without a fight. However, the US is getting increasingly tied down by its $11 trillion deficit and high unemployment, so it will be harder for it to respond how it wants to

Finally, we are in a new paradigm. We are no longer in a world dominated by the US and other Western democracies. The world is starting to look East, and Emerging Markets are increasingly becoming more dominant, self-reliant, and focusing on their own growth. In fact, they are the ones currently carrying the global economy while western powers are trying to figure out how to get out of the mess their in. As the world looks East, the dollar will continue its decline, and since precious metals are priced in dollars, then there value will still increase. In fact, its not so much that commodities are increasing in price, rather it is the dollar that is decreasing in value. An ounce of Gold roughly still buys the same amount of Oil as it did before. Its just now you need more dollars to purchase either.

Look at this map: [Current Global Public Debt](http://www.economist.com/content/global_debt_clock)

First, focus on Russia, China, and India, with low debt, high growth, and booming populations. Then look at the US and Europe, with huge debt, little to no growth, and aging populations. Then look at where the Middle East and Africa are located.

There is a reason we are in the Middle East, and it goes beyond just the oil. RIC need more and more resources to continue there expansion, and are ready to pounce on Middle East. China and Russia have a somewhat cozy relationship with Iran, which is their foot in the door to the region. In my opinion, this is why the US and EU is so opposed to Iran expanding its influence in the region, thereby strengthening the RIC's position by proxy. The US needs those resources, which is why we will back whatever dictator we have to as long we have first dibs those resources.

Also China has been making huge investments in resource rich Africa, even being involved developing infrastructure in several African countries to help them access those resources more easily.

The US and EU now have to compete for resources, and that never used to be the case. Now that we are, we no longer have a free ride and a huge deficit and high unemployment doesn't help, especially if you start throwing inflation into the mix. Basically, the world economy (and the world in general) is going through a major restructuring, and we no longer live in a world dominated by America and Europe. When all is said and done, i doubt the US will still find itself on top

I may have strayed off topic a bit, but my point is the larger picture still looks bleak, and as long as it does, gold and silver will remain a safe haven so why bet against them now..

&gt; Plus even if it did cause autism would you rather your kid dead or with autism?

But, I'll get back to that.

I haven't been that familiar with Dr. Andrew Wakefield's work.  The impression I had was that his study contained too small a sample to substantiate the links between MMR vaccines and autism.  I do, however, try to verify points of view.  This, of course, requires research.

&gt; And the ""scientist"" that investigated the vaccines to prove they cause autism one decade ago proved it, but in 2010 he admitted he faked the results.

You've either misunderstood something reported or are repeating an incorrect statement.  I've found no evidence that Dr. Wakefield has ever ""admitted he faked the results.""

The Wakefield report identified a collection of symptoms, which he called [autistic enterocolitis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autistic_enterocolitis).  These symptoms were what he used to identify the link between autism and MMR vaccines.  His proposed solution was not to eliminate vaccines, but to separate the three vaccines and extend the time period between children receiving the vaccines.

This seems reasonable.  Other medical researchers have seen indicators of a link between the MMR vaccines and autism.  If there is indeed a link between one of the ingredients found in this combined vaccine, it would be easier to isolate the source if the vaccine were separated out for each disease and given at different times.

I know one of the sentences above has likely set off a trigger for some:

&gt; Other medical researchers have seen indicators of a link between the MMR vaccines and autism.

The truth is that if Dr. Wakefield were the only medical researcher/doctor to have proposed a link between the MMR vaccine and autism, discrediting him would put an end to the controversy.  Dr. Wakefield was, however, expanding on research already completed by other medical professionals.   Some researchers have also claimed that they were able to replicate Dr. Wakefield's work, including the authors of the report, [*Clinical Presentation and Histologic Findings at Ileocolonoscopy in Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder and Chronic Gastrointestinal Symptoms*](http://www.rescuepost.com/files/f_1816-aui-clinical-presentation-and-histologic-findings-at-ileocolonoscopy-in-ch-pdf_25401.pdf).

There are, in fact, a number of medical researchers investigating ""anecdotal and scientific evidence to support a link between MMR vaccine, bowel disease and other neurological problems.""  This hypothesis did not originate with Dr. Wakefield, nor does it rely completely upon the findings of Dr. Wakefield.  Science is still investigating very good evidence indicating some truth to the hypothesis.

I do want to revisit your earlier statements.

&gt; Actually they don't cause anything.

I don't know if this is meant to be a general statement in reference to vaccines in general, or specifically aimed at the MMR/autism link.  If this were meant to be a general statement, it couldn't be more wrong.  The list of conditions/diseases caused by vaccines is long - and growing.  Recently, H1N1 flu vaccines were linked to narcolepsy.  There are over 150 vaccine induced diseases/conditions, including Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), Gullain-Barré Syndrome, Graves' disease, Bell's Palsy, lymphoma, and fibromyalgia.

&gt; It's a myth created by idiot parents that vaccinated their kids but after that their kids coincidentally got autism.

Much like the myth created by idiots that claim tasers can be lethal after witnessing an individual getting tased and then learning that, coincidentally, the individual died within minutes/hours?

&gt; Plus even if it did cause autism would you rather your kid dead or with autism?

Here is where you lose the anti-vaccine crowd completely.  Most in this group are aware of the risks associated with receiving vaccines.  The list of risks associated with vaccines grows with the number of studies into the practice.  In a majority of the cases, the risks of developing a vaccine induced illness/condition are small.  Yet, they are there.  In some rare examples, the risks  of developing a vaccine induced illness/condition appear to be greater - such as the recent [cases of narcolepsy associated with the H1N1 flu vaccines in Europe](http://healthland.time.com/2011/02/10/the-link-between-an-h1n1-vaccine-and-narcolepsy/) or the [risk of contracting a deadly case of polio from the polio vaccines in Africa](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21149823/ns/health-infectious_diseases/).

Some in this crowd are also aware that vaccine programs are likely to lead to higher incidence of the disease, as well as more virulent cases of the disease. Examples can be provided regarding smallpox, polio, and whooping cough (pertusis).

**None** see it as a choice between raising a child with autism or burying them.  This is a [false dilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma).  

Many feel that by eliminating the risks associated with vaccinations (by not getting them) and by following the lessons learned regarding proper nutrition, hygiene, food handling, and isolation/quarantine of contagions - they won't have to deal with either of the two options provided in the false dilemma example above.

Not sure where this notion is coming from. I don't really think India claims a superior political establishment. Many people in India actually wonder whether the authoritarian model would aid them in development, and I doubt that you would hear anyone claim that the democratic model is always better for development.

I guess I would say that there may be an added value to freedom. It doesn't really make sense to me to measure the value of political systems by GDP growth rate. Perhaps that's one metric/consideration, but, assuming you live in a democratic country, would you really argue to give up democracy in exchange for more income? 

I guess what I'm trying to say is political system=/= economic system, and it doesn't really make sense to say ""if country A is growing more quickly than B, Country A's political establishment is superior.""

You are assuming every Christian person in North America is online. If we went by that logic, there would be NO room for non-Christians to be online in North America because the number of Christians outnumber the number of people with 'net access.

Not exactly. If you check you'll find that all western european countries _with a state church_ are largely secular. The secularity of society is IMO a function of the secularity of the state, which runs the church.

In countries where the church is independent of the state (e.g. the catholic countries and the US) society is more religious, while the worst fundamentalism is found in countries where a church runs the state (Iran!).

Imagine that by default all americans were born in to the Church of America, led by bishops appointed by Bush and Obama, and with a creed determined by congress, and it's pretty easy to see that it by necessity must be a pretty secular church.

Wrong.

&gt;he would have to regard all the endings, tenses, and grammatical structures, since it is still during the Roman Empire Classic Latin would have to be learned. 

While he would have to regard all the grammatical structures (the same is true of *any* language though...), soldiers would not have spoken classical Latin, that was the language of the gentry. The problem is that Latin as spoken by the common people (*vulgus*, hence vulgar Latin) was, by and large, not recorded in any way. 

&gt;And Romans stole their gods from Greek gods, 

Completely and utterly false. All Indo-European religions have similar gods; it's not surprising that Jupiter and Zeus have similar aspects.

What the Romans *did* do was ""translate"" the names of foreign (including Greek) gods into their nearest Roman equivalent when writing in Latin. This is not the same thing however.",0,False,1427109104,t3_h0u9r,t5_2qh1i,True,AskReddit,0,t1_c1ruurs,

2. this version is one which is commonly seen in Europe. Folded legs, logo on the side pocked. 2 hands streched out over the bench.

3. how to use this statue to narrow the search down
3.a Locate company which builds them.
3.b get them to tell us which version this is: which build era. How common. Which geographical region?

4. Or find fansite with all the versions build.

What we can deduct with: 'this picture was taken in Eastern Europe between 1990-1995


FACT: McDonalds was not very common in Eastern Europe in the 1990's. About 10-50 is my guess. I used to travel this region a lot in this timeframe.

1. Find distribution list of Mc Donalds restaurants in E-Europe around the time the picture was taken.
2. search is now down to less then 50.
3. perhaps use google maps to check if this particular restaurant was in a street with possibility to:
- park a car (across a street?)
- park up close 
-people can walk around, and did so

However, when considering the origin of economic or consumer trends within the postbellum period of Japan, this postulate becomes very shaky.

For instance, the phenomenon of ""geesha"" girls:
Although inherently Japanese, the rampant popularity of these prostitutes(and I emphasize their status as prostitutes to separate them from the entirely different ""geisha""), was largely driven by the demand from the occupants; the U.S. militarymen. Over the next 50 years during MacArthur's ""Westernization""(which is ironic in the sense that Japan was more industrialized than most European nations at the time), we see a tremendous rise in the amount of sexually-targeted marketing and outright exploitation of Japanese females. If you look at most of the popular anime and manga targeted to children, they are disturbingly rife with hypersexualization of female characters.

The large militarymen population and the damaged economy set the foundations for what would become the largest sex-based market ever. To this day, the Japanese love hotel industry, pornography, and production of sexual products(toys, games, um...robots) is quite astonishing.

Japan is a suzerainty to the United States. It is rather difficulty to isolate a specific cause or origin for how these things emerge, but the fact remains that the ""used panties"" emerged in the 90s when foreign(the majority being American) investment was at its highest, right before the economic crash, right around 1993 when these Used Panty Machines started being discovered.

You may be entirely correct in stating that it was a Japanese ""thing"" for a Japanese ""demand"". Bear in mind that this hypersexual mentality and consumerism was an unforeseen consequence of MacArthur creating a market for sex while simultaneously appeasing his militarymen, which has been a necessity in every military occupation ever. 

tl;dr 
When we talk about sexuality in Japanese culture, we have to establish definitions of what that means.

It might be instructive to dismantle *why* Christianity and Islam are so popular. Somewhat surprisingly, to some, [intolerance and violence were the ""secrets"" of their success](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/fxunu/what_is_it_about_yehwah_that_makes_him_the/c1jfkux).

Racism and classism can be subtle in America, believe it or not.  I grew up in a wealthy W.A.S.P town (private schools etc), but then had the good fortune to slum in cities as a musician for a decade, and then travel the country.  L.A.'s racism is a free-for-all, with every group distrustful of every other, but rarely personally.  That is: the korean liquor stores will have one hand on the shotgun as soon as a black man walks in, and say horrible slurs - but take the same korean woman and sit her down with a black woman for coffee or a meeting and *none* of that will be visible on the surface.  It's the same for basically everyone except the artist communities (very cosmopolitan) and the wealthy (flat-out racist - just look at Hollywood).

Boston's racism is more classist: the city is divide by ethnicity and strata, to the point that you can tell the time by what color the people are on whatever subway you're riding.  They're polite, but they don't *intermingle* very much, which is simply impossible in LA.  Boston also has a very pronounced ""old money"" race/class issue, which I'll get back to.

In rural New England no-one cares because there's no real criminal class.  Connecticut OTOH is filled with white trash calling everyone else trash.  In the rural KY/TN area it is the most average: a *small* percentage of the poor whites and the rich whites still agree that it's the lower races who are to blame for God not smiling on our good baptist community.  It's quite amazing that Rand Paul won a senate race, actually.  Aquabuddha, Ho!

Everyone normal in Phoenix AZ has long accepted the massive and ongoing Latino influx as part of doing business.  The two problem areas are the LA gangs on the west side, and all the ex-Nazi German retirees in Sedona, who pay for the un-fucking-believably corrupt and racist cops state wide.  AK and NY are the only two states more palpably corrupt, and I've lived in FL and TX too.

But you know what?  Maybe it's my cultural bias, but the most racist communities I've found are white, protestant, upper middle class, and vote democratic.  They erected a sign on the town line that said ""[Town] Celebrates Diversity!"", to which someone with spray paint appended ""but not with MY daughter"".  They bus in ""poor"" (read: black) children from the city, but Cornel West will be respectfully declined admission to the yacht clubs.  There is just enough of a memory of the 60-70's for them to *believe* in equality-and-all-that, but so long out of the habit of practicing it they've slipped back into tribalism.  And that's why Boston's race/classism is so indicative of the issue in America.  All the new wealth and underclasses don't care - we've always been the melting pot and we know it's a good thing.  And there are some poor folks of all races who succumb to scape-goating, but the real injustices come from the older money and power structures.  If I said ""freemason"" it's untrue but evocative: that order of people who insulate themselves from society by imposing a meaningless hierarchy of class and then clawing their way to the top of it.

They saw torture had failed as a justice tool and incorporated that into our Constitution. 

It's not that torture is honestly always wrong. Sometimes torture could be worth it, but he probability is so low it's not. Sure if this was 24 and you could torture some guy to save a million lives then torture would seem like the moral high ground, but 99% of the time you don't save anyone and you just torture the person until they tell you what you want to hear or make up some story to get you to stop for awhile.

However ... to have a truly honest conversation about this to some degree justice does have to be torture. If you think serving 20-30 years in prison isn't ultimately a torturous experience I'd laugh at you. If I could chose to be tortured for months or imprisoned for years I'd easily chose torture. To me the waiting over years is far worse than pain. 

So we are ignoring the fact that torture affects people differently and that some elements of torture will always exist in a justice system. Long term confinement, being treated like an animal, being feed sub-standard food without no other options, have to shit or piss right in front of other inmates, lack of cleanliness in jails and prisons, potentially be forced into gangs or raped. 

There is a lot of what I would call torture in our standard justice system already. Honestly being water boarded would be one of my lesser concerns. ",0,False,1427109241,t3_h0yc7,t5_2qh3l,True,news,0,t1_c1rv56k,

For instance, you can see that you haven't reforged anything, and you're missing a lot of enchants and a couple glyphs.

Now, it's probably not a big deal that you haven't enchanted yet, because most of your gear is still really crappy.  But as you start to replace those items with 346 (or maybe even 333) gear, you're going to want to enchant it too.

But I guess this really skips a step.  The very first thing you should do is go to a site like [ElitistJerks](http://elitistjerks.com/f74/) and read up on how to maximize your DPS as a hunter.

Important things to watch for are the best spec(s) including glyphs, important stats (you should have two, maybe three if it's easy to hit cap) and ""rotation"" or ""priority list.""  

Wowhead is another handy tool for figuring out what items you should be watching for.  It's basically a giant database of everything in the game.  Some handy pages are going to be the [Cataclysm Factions](http://www.wowhead.com/factions=1162) page, which can tell you what kind of rep gear you can get.  There are going to be at least a few epics ([Treads of Malorne](http://www.wowhead.com/item=62385), from Guardians of Hyjal Exalted; [Signet of the Elder Council](http://www.wowhead.com/item=62362), from Earthen Ring Exalted) just for getting your rep up to a certain point.  They should also have a variety of 333 (for honored) and 346 (for revered) gear available.  You should take a look at your current rep levels and see if there are any upgrades you can already buy.

Also, keep an eye out on the auction house for good upgrades for cheap.  The RotZ dungeons have a lot of BoEs that seem to be going for relatively cheap on my server (some as low as 1-2k gold).  Of course, if you have plenty of money, there are also some 359 epics available to purchase.

Start running regular dungeons, then heroics, then RotZ heroics.  These are progressively harder and will give progressively better gear.  Worry about getting decently geared before you try to start getting into raids.

I don't know what the PUG raiding situation is like on your server, a lot fo PUG raiding communities have died out since 4.01, but you should at least be able to find Argaloth (""BH"") PUGs on a fairly regular basis.  That's also the easiest of the raid fights available and a good place to start practicing your raid tactics.

Makes sure to go online and watch videos (Tankspot has good ones, or you can just search for the fight on YouTube) for any fight you're going to be doing.  You might even want to do this for heroics before you start heading into dungeons. (I'm a fan of the Yogscast dungeon videos, but again there are plenty out there.)

Quite frankly, there are only 2 or 3 events a year in NA and EU that are big and get a significant amount of coverage. The reason for this ""flurry"" of submissions is simply because of i42 in the UK (one of the biggest events in EU) being one weekend, and the ESEA LAN (probably the biggest event in NA) following the next.

Regardless, it's hardly like these submissions are an absolute spam taking up a great deal of useful space. For example the submission directly above this on my /r/tf2 page atm is a post suggesting you should be able to wear a hat on your shoulder instead of your head; something that would have absolutely no gameplay effect of any kind. And directly below is a link to a picture of someone dressed as a spy at a furries convention. If you would rather have more of these ""quality"" submissions as opposed to a small promotion of something that a large group of people have put a huge amount of time and effort into, then you are free to simply scroll past said submissions and ignore them entirely.

We don't need a subreddit for it, we have our own forums, leagues and news sites. We'd just like to promote the larger events in more public places to try and generate some interest and a new group of followers.

One issue with BlackBerry is that it depends on BES, provided say by Verizon. You may not pick up your emails via BlackBerry or be able to use BBM if you are connected via a foreign GSM network. It depends on how Verizon configure the BES and provision the device. Web and non-BlackBerry services should be okay and you ought to get full functionality over Wi-Fi. This may not be an issue, or there could be other problems as well. BlackBerry is funny and IMO clunky. The devices are slow and there's no apps.

My opinion is that any Android device with a keyboard and K-9 Mail is a better messaging phone than any current BlackBerry. If you like the BlackBerry format, then have a look at the Droid Pro.

If you are prepared to buy a handset unsubsidized, then don't buy it through your carrier. Get an unbranded device from one of the online suppliers, it will be cheaper and not have any carrier software that can interfere with roaming use such as locked-down APNs.

If you want it to work on Verizon as well, it needs to be a ""world"" model with CDMA and GSM radios. Germany is GSM 2100MHz for 3G, and 900/1800 for 2G.

You will have a wider choice of handsets if you consider GSM only devices (i.e. non-CDMA). But if you want to bring it back to the US, you will have a choice of either AT&amp;T or T-Mobile and they use different 3G frequencies. T-Mobile uses AWS (1700/2100) and there are a limited number of phones that support it - but they include 2100MHz for 3G in Germany. AWS handsets are easier to find second-hand than new and unbranded. AT&amp;T uses 850/1900 so you would need a tri-band radio to cover Germany as well (850/1900/2100). Plenty of phones are available with these frequencies, sometimes described as ""US 3G"" or just ""AT&amp;T bands"", but make sure they have the third band.

Germany has excellent 3G services from several operators. Vodafone does have the best coverage, but one thing to be aware of is that it can be difficult to get a SIM card with a good rate, especially off contract. In Germany, the networks are required to take information about the purchaser (presumably for law-enforcement purposes), and when I was there in March, the only network I could get with was O2.

I got a good deal - 5GB of data for €40, no expiry - but it was thanks to a friendly salesperson in an O2 store prepared to activate the SIM on the basis of my UK driving licence and German hotel address, which he was not really supposed to do. You may have a problem without ID from the EU.

You can save a few bucks by buying the actual SIM card at Media Markt or Saturn, which are big-box retailers like Fry's. It will cost a couple of Euro's instead of the €10-20 it would cost in a phone store. You take the SIM into the phone store and they will activate whatever plan you want on it.

If you end up on O2 in Germany with an Android device (which would be my advice), the connection requires installing an app called ""SADM Security"". You will receive a text with a link to it the first time you start up with the new SIM card. I think it basically writes the correct APN settings, but activating the connection the first time on a new device requires entering two different PIN numbers. The app is in English, but the information you get from O2 is all in German. If you don't understand German, you will not make it through the set up process! Get the guy in the store to set it up, and then change the PIN numbers afterwards.

I factory reset my phone while I was there and the SIM would not give me a data connection until I had reinstalled the app and entered the PINs again so back up the app - it's a real hassle to get the link again.

Finally, I wouldn't bother keeping up your Verizon contract while you are abroad. Port your number to Google Voice so you don't lose it, and get a US SkypeIn number to forward it to. Just pay the extra month to avoid an ETF and then shut down the Verizon account. Get a German SkypeIn number to give to people when you are in Germany. SkypeIn numbers are a few bucks for a whole year. Install the GVoice Callback app to integrate free US calling into the dialler.

With this setup, you can get just a data plan and run Skype and Google Voice. People in the US can still call and text you on your regular number and you can call and text them for nothing. You'll have a local number to give to people in Germany that rings the same line and it will work even when you're not in Germany. You can call and text in Germany for cheap Skype rates.

tl;dr: An unbranded 850/1900/2100MHz GSM Android device on an O2 data plan. Port your US number to Google Voice and drop Verizon when the contract is up. Get Skype numbers in Germany and the US to hook it all up. Get a cheap data-only plan in the US too when you come back.",0,False,1427109253,t3_gztgk,t5_2qgzt,True,gadgets,0,t1_c1rv63h,

a) there was no real class mobility in the US. What mobility existed was based on millions of immigrants migrating into America and physically lifting up the social pyramid by crawling in as the underclass. If you simply held onto your current social status, you were 'upwardly mobile' simply because of the effect of mass immigration. If you exploited the hell out of them, you could be rich

b) The purpose of mandatory public schooling threefold:  
i) to train workers for a more modern factory especially those workers who were recent immigrants. (child labor was allowed at this time, so some training was already provided by the owners to get them to be useful)    
ii) get non-english speaking immigrants up to speed to be used as cannon fodder after abyssmal WWI performance. This included fomenting nationalism, a national culture and american character and providing an innoculation against socialist tendencies that were becoming popular among an exploited working class.   
iii) to mollify the flaring tensions between labor and capitalists caused by kids getting killed in unsafe working conditions and who couldn't be instructed to avoid death, because they didn't have the necessary education while living in huge immigrant ghettos. (this is back when most ny ghettos were full of white ppl) 

Child labor wasn't even wholly abolished till the late 1930's, and I'm going to guess that mandatory public schooling only started at about that time.

None of this was done to create class mobility, but none of this stopped class mobility either. What stopped class mobility was the end of massive legal immigration that allowed european serfs to enter the country in huge numbers to lift the overall social pyramid by becoming the new base. 

After ww2 america became an uncontested globe spanning empire and there was no longer any need to haul foreigners into america for cheap labor, it was simply easier to exploit them in their homelands and ship the fruits of their labor into the country. This killed the need for america's original immigration policy and we've been stagnating since.

My grandmother was one generation out of Ellis Island.  Much of her Roman-Catholic, highly educated middle class family was still in Poland.  They tried to save their Jewish neighbors, and were sent to the camps alongside them (mostly Auschwitz as her family was in Krakow). Only a handful of a large family survived.  [Hitler hated the ethnic Poles almost as much as he hated the Jews](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_crimes_against_ethnic_Poles) - most people forget that.

But as my grandmother's family members were not Jewish, their deaths are not considered Holocaust deaths; I have frequently been accused anti-Semitism for questioning that logic, which both saddens and angers me.  I have no less pity for European Jews who were slaughtered out of bigotry, but it always amazes me how many Jews are quick to claim that the targeted death-dealing done in the name of the Third Reich solely impacted them.

Not that Hilter and the ""final solution"" weren't horrible, but the Nazis pretty much went after anyone they didn't like or considered a threat to the Third Reich.  That my grandmother's family died in the same places and by the same methods - but were not Jewish - doesn't mean they weren't victims of the same mindless hate and twisted ambition.

They are so few because they were killed and slaughtered en masse by your 'founding fathers'. Arguably many many more in number than the holocaust that you use to justify the existence of Israel with. Also whether they would have the ability to 'govern and maintain a nation with their population' is not only irrelevant but also asinine. They governed themselves just fine before the European invasion and land snatch. I am sure the jews of Germany did not imagine they had many brothers and sisters left after the holocaust either.

They were killed and slaughtered, this is a sin of America's past. Also, for legal reasons, it would be difficult to give land away from the states. Israel's land on the other hand, was already being held for eventual partition.

&gt;Who is 'the world'? The West? The ones who were warring with each other in the first place? Or maybe it is the Bush family who supplied the steel for nazi Germany? I doubt it was the native people of palestine who agreed to such a 'deal'.

The native people, sadly, had no power. But, that is war. Israel originally appeared as a bare bones state but due to several wars, they were able to expand. Israel was going to get desert land while Palestine was going to get the arable land. The Arab states near by couldn't take this and so declared war. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_of_Israel
From then it all went down hill.

&gt;If you support Israel on some historical claim then what you are really saying is you support the Biblical version of their claim to this land which many modern day Christians also support. You should perhaps examine where you draw your ideas from as this idea is not supported by the Qur'aan from my understanding.

Really? I had read in surah 2 that a prophet had chosen King Saul as a King for the Israelites. Just to back my claim up: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Saul#In_Islam

There had been a King of Israel in the past, you can't have a King of Israel without Israel.

&gt;If it is on the basis purely of human rights then I call you on hypocrisy of not being as vigilant about the Native Americans having their land back. It is absolutely no different and in my opinion the persecution of the Native Americans far exceeds the jewish persecution.

I can't have the Native Americans regain their land due to the few number of them and the fact the states would flip if they found out the Federal government was taking their land. The Palestine region was already to be partitioned. I do support strongly funding reservations though and allowing them to have their own degrees of autonomy so we could try to restore to them their home.

Keep the money in the states, let them figure it out. If a state fucks up, it's completely on the citizens to take care of themselves or move to a different state. If the southern states want to abolish social safety nets, fine, let them-- the resident can choose to live there with a 10% effective tax rate with the knowledge that they have no safety. If another state wants to tax at European levels but provide cradle-to-grave support, let them.

A  lot of metal connoisseurs forget that music isn't classified by the raw sound qualities of each note anywhere other than metal. Most of this modern stuff can be broken up simply by looking at the rhythm.

Rock vs. metal isn't a scale of heaviness. Rock really requires and relies heavily on that 4/4 thud thud thud you can bob your head to, and variations on it. That's why American style is said to evolve from a heavy rock influence. As it moves away from dependance on 4/4 but to other cookie cutter style thudding you get more metal core. As it moves away from the thudding you get post-rock or post-metal.

European style metal generally pulls more from the chest with its passion and rarely depends on thudding out rhythms that move the head.(why everyone just stands around at black metal shows.) They focus way more into how things progress, both in rhythm and actual notes, which neither adds nor removes complexity, just ""moves"" it.

Now tool, tool has that weird quality of having an element from everywhere you could put it, but more than just any of those places. It is notorious for being difficult to class so most people just call it ""art rock."" Realistically, it is downright post-metal with a time machine.

Why this is correct is open to debate, and the details have been lost to history, but it's probably due to the gender of boats being female in most Indo-European languages.  Both 'linter' and 'cumba' (the Latin words for boats) are female, so it's probably a safe bet that it's *fairly* traditional.  

I'm not certain why countries get the female pronoun, but I wouldn't be surprised if it was because of the way that nobility would take the title of a region as their own.  So ""Normandy"" in the male would refer to the Duke of Normandy and in the female would refer to the land.

I would disagree with this, as I find all kinds of other sinful human reasons for the presence of violence in the scriptures. We don't have to look far today to find leaders justifying their wars by claiming that God wanted them to do it.  It's my experience that the Israelites leaned heavily on such justification for a lot of their military aspirations.  There's an amazing essay by Robert Allen Warrior called ""A Native American Perspective: Canaanites, Cowboys, and Indians,"" that describes some of the genocide perpetrated by Israelites in our sacred texts, and parallels it to European treatment of Native Americans. There's a great many moments of scripture that work best as a warning against repeating such horrific treatment of others rather than as an example of what a praise-worthy God would want.  On the issue of violence in particular, we need to look at the assumptions and agendas of the scripture writers, especially when we're relying on them to know something of God's will.

Traveling alone is not all bad, either. It forces you to be more social. You'll probably extend yourself more to locals, instead of letting yourself ease into a bubble with your traveling companion. Also, popular hostels are great places to meet new and interesting friends from all over the world, so you'll hardly ever feel lonely.

General tips to not getting lost/confused:

1. Look up your destination cities first on wikitravel. Go to the ""Get Around"" section and familiarize yourself with the available metro systems. You might be able to save some money, too, such as in Istanbul with the 50% off transit card.
2. Don't hesitate to ask for directions. Look for someone who isn't in a hurry and they'll likely be more than happy to point you where you need to go. You can also chat up girls while doing this, too.
3. Always ask twice. Sometimes a local will get the direction wrong. Sometimes you'll have made a mistake asking, e.g. asking for ""Topkapi"" instead of ""Topkapi Palace"" which are on opposite ends of town. A second opinion will make you more confident and help ensure you're not wasting an hour wandering the wrong way.
4. Look up the places you want to go to and find their opening hours. Not every attraction is 7-days a week. Save yourself the disappointment of crossing the city to see something great, only to be met with closed doors.",0,False,1427109469,t3_h1fcf,t5_2qh41,True,travel,0,t1_c1rvmkz,

However, the sum total -- the integral, specifically -- of temperature over the year and the earth's entire surface is increasing, and this is what is meant. So, for example, if it gets colder by a few degrees in the US (say) and hotter by a few degrees more in the Sahara, there is a *net* increase in *global* temperature. Essentially, the earth's atmosphere is retaining more heat, but it doesn't do it evenly.

One of the big problems here is that it appears that many of the places that are getting warmer and wetter are in the arctic and antarctic. While this is happening, the gulf stream (which coincidentally is what keeps Europe, including Iceland, more or less temperate instead of having it be like Canada or Siberia, which given its latitude would be consistent) is shifting.

So, TL;DR -- massive shifts in global climate, including an increase in temperature volatility, meaning more cold as well as more hot, is not incompatible with global warming.

Most famous, perhaps, is the case of hundreds of Jewish orphans housed in a tent city outside of Tehran until they were allowed to immigrate to Palestine.

' Less known but equally significant, the Iranian government permitted Jewish philanthropic organizations to gather supplies from throughout the British Empire in Iran. Aid convoys, organized in Iran by the Jewish Agency for Palestine, delivered life saving packages to needy Polish Jews freed from forced labor in Siberia but left stranded and without support throughout Central Asia.

' Iran’s proud history of help for targeted Jews continued in the post-war period, and the government opened its borders to Jews fleeing anti-Semitic violence in neighboring Muslim states. When pogroms against Iraqi Jews erupted in the wake of the establishment of the new state of Israel in 1948, Iran provided a safe haven.

Apple products provide a 1 year limited warranty - they will honour that agreement with respect to parts and labour. 

A *retailer* is required under EU law (EU directive in question is 1999/44/EC) simply known as the EU productive directive of 1999. It requires retailers to provide goods which are
 &gt;'as described, fit for purpose and of satisfactory quality'

so if you purchase it at a store (whether it is tax free at an airport or not) the person that sold it to you (not apple) has to provide you with some recourse. THIS IS NOT A WARRANTY IT IS A GUARANTEE. There is an important difference. 

The person selling it to you is not bound by the guarantee 
&gt;'if the (fault) has its origin in materials supplied by the consumer'

The main thing the EU rule provides is that it means if you go back to the shop where you bought it you are not required to show the fault is inherent in the product and not down to their actions - but this does not mean they are bound to the guarantee if the product shows any signs of damage OR no *exact and specific* fault can be found.

I think the issues legalized polygamy would create already exist in the US due to decades of a high divorce and remarriage rates. A review of family court case law and some thoughtful legislation would take care of things. The latter part is where the real poop storm will happen, as US politics is as much side show and fear mongering as anything else. The airwaves would be saturated with pundits crying about all the usual problems associated with polygamist cultures, and claiming the very existence of the US was threatened. 

Child brides would not be directly addressed because child brides are not a product of polygamy, but a product of the culture. It is a separate issue. 

Given your statements, and as a person who actually lives in the United States, I’m going to say your opinion of the regard of women in the US is a hyperbolic caricature. 

First, the groups you are referring to, like the FLDS, are *extreme* groups, who live in, who *must* live in isolated communities that they control. To suggest that the culture of the FLDS is even remotely representative of general US culture is absurd. It’s like judging technology in the US using the Amish as the representative example. The FLDS is a small minority of a minority who are viewed even by mainstream mormons (themselves a more sexists culture within the US,) as extremist nutters. 

(Tho, the LDS still practices an underhanded, magical version of polygamy, but more likely than not a random mormon will be anti-polygamy if asked, and sometimes won’t even believe that polygamy was ever part of the LDS.)

Second, I imagine you’re from a European country that does regard women better than the general US. But if you’re going to say, “as a *European* woman”, I’m going to include the whole of Europe, and we can go tit for tat over the examples and levels of misogyny and sexism. And you chose abortion as an example? While it’s true we in the US have to continuously fight attacks from the religious right and others with a perceived moral imperative, abortion is legal in the US. In fact, it is practically a defacto right. A glance at abortion law in Europe [here,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law#Europe) and it seems that plenty of countries even in the EU have more restrictive laws on abortion than the US. Abortion isn’t a factor in this, however.

The reason legalized polygamy wouldn’t lead to a culture like the FLDS, with its associated problems, is women in the US are expected to be educated (in general), can own property, pursue a career; and most importantly chose if and whom to marry and divorce at the drop of a hat. They are individual citizens which no longer require the guardianship of a man. 
So if a man wants to take another wife (assuming there isn’t a law preventing him doing so without the consent of his other spouses) the wife can divorce him. Or, since the law would be equally applied, she could also marry another man, if only out of spite. 

Legalizing polygamy would, I think, do little more than allow a small minority who are already in polygamous relationships, represented by the OP, so obtain a legal status for their relationships. The liberal marriage laws and culture in the US have already been shaped by proclivities of the majority, and so most people will continue on with the status quo of serial monogamy, legally in marriage as they do informally in relationships.  

Tho, it may present problems for those in a more… “European polygamous relationship,” if an accepted mistress can now also be legally married to the married man. :P

I actually think there's two different philosophical points here where we disagree:

a) The idea that society is competitive vs supportive. Take this sentence, for example:

&gt; You can't expect to be a burger-flipper and demand 3 months paid vacation. Why? You are incredibly replaceable.

... I don't think it should be necessary for someone to ""demand"" time off, because if you drift societal niceties down to the level of what people can argue, you tend to penalise the poor and the unskilled. And I think they should have a nice time, too.

At this level, my taste is to prefer the state to step in and guarantee good things for everyone. As I said above, I don't think it's too destructive of the economy, and the state is the only actor strong enough to ensure the weak don't get trampled.

b) The idea that people should only get what they work for vs what society can afford to distribute.

Take this sentence for example:

&gt; if you want something out you need to put in.

... why? Other than through a philosophy that demands it, why should this be the case? To me, it doesn't seem scientific.

I've found before that some people subscribe to a belief as an item of faith (I have no idea if this matches you or not, by the way, this is just an aside to help explain things), and I've often seen it in Americans, but it's so far outside my own experience and belief it's hard to discuss things.

It's admirable in many ways, because it leads to self-sufficiency and independence. But I also think it's quite wrong:

It's the idea that someone should only receive what they work for.

Here's a thought experiment. Imagine you can somehow measure happiness across the country. And for the sake of argument let's imagine it's true happiness (art, connectedness, joy, love of fellows, whatever you like) and not something that would happen if people were just drugged.


Now, imagine a policy that tries to maximise this happiness by varying things and seeing what has the most effect.

... if it turned out that having ten percent unemployment and long leisure time both worked and maximised public happiness, then that would be a scientific fact (in our imaginary universe).

But I think many people, particularly a number of Americans, would dislike the policy regardless. Even if under all possible systems they would be on average less happy, there seems to be a philosophical position that they just don't want to give things to people who don't earn it.

Take this sentence:

&gt; I don't think any economic policy that accepts high unemployment should be considered.

... from my point of view, why ever not? The question for me is whether it generally increases happiness and makes society a better place. But, as I say, I think it's like Marmite. Some people wouldn't accept certain policies even if they were proven to work better.

Now if you say that's you, then here we can talk no more, because we're onto articles of faith.

But, if you think that the answer is to do whatever works, then all I can say is that from my position in Western Europe, I think we have a better standard of living by running our governments with lots of benefits - and I much prefer it to the alternatives.",0,False,1427109707,t3_gzeao,t5_2cneq,True,politics,0,t1_c1rw4t3,

Even with that though, you still can't get away from the fact that you need a lot more transmission capacity from where you have high winds (Scotland) to the big urban and industrial centres (south of England)

&gt;Especially, when France have its own windmills to take for.

That's not really the issue. France has a lot of cheap electricity from nuclear so they don't really need to take up more wind power. The real issue with wind power is its variability. Interconnectors help by smoothing the regional variations in wind power generation and by bringing prices down overall. 

&gt;Wind power gives you feeling of smugness only when it is produced locally. Subsidizing it abroad is no good.

Not quite. The aim is to have a lot more interconnections that will cancel out the regional variations in wind energy production and therefore make wind energy a lot more reliable. Interconnectors can help by helping create a more liquid pan-european energy market which would be beneficial for many reasons, not least by curbing market power that big energy companies have in their own countries.

I think the role of government is only to maintain order so that no one's rights are infringed upon by others and everyone has the opportunity to be successful on their own.

There are a lot of soccer fans in the US who perceive anything European soccer related to be superior, full stop.  Therefore in their minds there is no reason to watch or care about the MLS.

Now to be fair, it wasnt till 2005 or 2006 that the MLS was in any position to change this (due to the near folding of the league in the early 2000s and the lack of stadium ownership among a myriad of other issues).  

Thus, its only been in the last couple of years that has begun to change.  I know this because I took one of these guys to a Red Bulls game 2 weeks ago and he was shocked at level of support etc (he figured no one cared here etc).  He immediately wanted to come back. But this level of awakening is a slow process.

And none of this means that the MLS will challenge EPL etc any time soon, but its a fun league to watch and attend games at. I think you will see more and more people recognize that in the near future. And it will be heightened as we get more and more US soccer stars emerging here and some even staying/coming back (see Agudelo, Bunbury, Ream, Feilharber, Donovan etc)

&gt;These dodos always have one thing in common: whether it’s knights charging with lances on very expensive horses or top gun brats like McCain zooming onto carrier decks in history’s most expensive aircraft, you’ll always find that the worst, most over-funded services are always the ones where the rich kids go to show their stuff. Seriously: why are there aircraft carriers? For asses like John McCain to crash on. Why do they keep getting funded long after they’ve been shown up?

It's among the least fair economic systems possible and is a natural historical development out of the conditions in europe during the industrial revolution, when feudalism was ending, and the rural population was forced toward the cities to sell their labour power by working in mills and factories. Capitalism does not produce goods based on social necessity, but rewards production of the same product by competing companies, each trying to outdo the other in terms of spending as little as possible, producing waste and inferior products. Capitalist production is directly responsible for the environmental crises caused by overproduction and the use of cheap, dangerous materials or methods. To generate more profit, wages are constantly under threat of being lowered.

When I said 'that culture is not representative' of the US: you may be underestimating the amount of work that needs to be done with regards to women's rights on this aspect'. I am not implying that most women would agree to live like the Mormons, simply there are severe issues of women's rights in the US. We can debate on the whole of Europe being a place of opportunity for women, so let me narrow it down to 'Old europe' and not the newer countries to have joined the European Union. Women's rights are pretty strong. I'm sorry but Abortion has become problematic in many states (was downright outlawed in either North or South Dakota during the Bush presidency) and it is a huge taboo in many parts of the US. Just seeing congressmen debate it in regards to planned parenthood is absolutely outrageous.

Also the chart you link to re-affirms the fact that Europe has pretty strong laws protecting it; I looked through the other groups and I didn't see any with as many 'yes', even all the Eastern European countries had mostly all 'yes' . That being said the US is one country, Europe is not. 
Also, look at that chart, apart from Ireland, the other places taht don't allow it, are positively minuscule territories: Vatican city (700 people...), Andorra (wasn't aware people actually lived there, for the rest of us it's 'where people go to buy cheap fags'), Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco (35 000 inhabitants), San Marino (where's that?)...


So let me ask you this, do you think many women in Africa/Asia who are involved in polygamous relationships actually embrace this lifestyle or do you think that it having become social norm gives them little choice? You also don't mention how many women raise children and then stop working and depend on their husband for income, these women have a tough time when things hit the fan with the husband because they have very little to depend on financially.

andhelostthem,9,True,1304281108,c1rworz,,0,San Jose Clash,9,t3_h1i5u,"There's two main reason why the MLS doesn't have great support. The first is the most obvious and it's because the level of play is significantly lower than major European and Latin American leagues. The MLS is slowly improving but the problem is that it's growing too slowly. This is due to a lack of talent because of US soccer's weak development structure... which is tied to the second reason why the MLS lacks support: US Soccer doesn't cover enough markets.

The league only has 18 teams and is not in enough cities to sustain national interest in the sport.

Baseball and Hockey have extensive minor league systems that are extremely well managed and cover many of the media markets that their top tier pro teams don't cover. Seattle, for example has no NHL hockey team however the state of Washington has 4 highly competitive minor league teams creating interest in the sport where there is no top-level team. 

American football lacks a true minor league system but that is covered by college football, which, even as an amateur league, has the largest levels of attendance out of any sports league on earth. Basketball also lacks a true minor league but like football has a strong collegiate league.  

The MLS however has none of these. There is no strong college or minor league system and the second-tier leagues, the USL and new NASL, are under marketed and under promoted. This creates huge pockets of the country where there is no soccer team to support. 
 
About 20 of the 30 largest media markets in the United States have no quality soccer team. Off the top of my head: Phoenix, Atlanta, Detroit, Miami, Orlando, Tampa, New Orleans, Minneapolis, Indianapolis, St. Louis, Milwaukee, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Sacramento, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, San Antonio.

These are all markets with no team to support and this causes the sport's growth to remain stagnant.

The good news for American soccer is that some teams are reaching a point where they're becoming an institution in their respective city so if the MLS falls apart a handful of the teams will be strong enough to stick around for some predecessor league. For instance if the MLS were to close shop tomorrow Seattle, Portland, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Montreal and Toronto would be strong enough to add a few clubs and support their own league.

We did join together because it will be better for everyone. But this kinda goes to my point of government - ensure no one is infringed upon by others, etc. **Everyone** benefits from living in an ordered society.

Replacing Old Plumbing
Any plumbing problem can happen with any plumbing pipes in your house. Like all building materials, your plumbing pipes will eventually wear out and have to be replaced. If you find yourself repairing leaky, corroded pipes every few months, it may be time to consider replacing the old system entirely – and soon. A corroded water pipe that bursts while you are away can cost you many thousands of dollars in damage to wall surfaces, framing members, and furnishings.
Identifying the materials used in your plumbing system can also tell you if replacement is advised. If you have galvanized steel pipes, for example, it is a good bet that they will need to be replaced in the near future. Most galvanized steel pipes were installed before 1960, and since steel pipes have a maximum life expectancy of 30 to 35 years, such a system is probably living on borrowed time. On the other hand, if your system includes copper supply pipes and plastic drain pipes, you can relax; these materials were likely installed within the last 40 years, and they are considerably more durable than steel, provided they were installed correctly.
Unless you live in a rambler with an exposed basement ceiling, replacing old plumbing nearly always involves some demolition and carpentry work. Even in the best scenario, you probably will find it necessary to open walls and floors in order to run new pipes. For this reason, replacing old plumbing is often done at the same time as a kitchen or bathroom remodelling project, when wall and floor surfaces have to be removed and replaced. 
Partial plumbing replacement involves replacing only those sections of your plumbing system that are currently causing additional plumbing problems. This is a quick, less expensive option than a complete renovation, but it is only a temporary solution. Old plumbing will continue to fail until you replace the entire system.
Complete plumbing replacement of all plumbing lines is an ambitious job, but doing this work yourself can save you thousands of dollars. To minimize the inconvenience, you can do this work in phases, replacing one branch of the plumbing system at a time. If you are inexperienced with plumbing repairs, we suggest calling your local London Plumber for more information.

Yes, that's basically what altruism says, and yes, I think that's a very fair way to view reality.  Selfishness is detrimental; selflessness is helpful.  Being selfish only helps a very small minority of people.  Selflessness improves the entire community.  It's a rather simple analysis of cost/benefit, with some very obvious examples of American society vs. European society.  Altruism leads to a better life.

Ayn Rand is saying we don't have the right to force people to be selfless.  On the contrary, I say that people do not have the unrestricted right to leech off society for their personal gain.  The American enterpreneur is more of a social parasite than the lazy unemployed man.

having covered this topic in one of my classes literally last thursday, I can tell you that this is far from the truth, most of the Jewish immigration into Israel came from north africa and middle eastern countries. its actually a widely circulated myth that most jews went to israel after the war (sure, plenty did, but nowhere near all, many more went to america) In contrast, if you want some numbers... around 100,000 Jews from europe went to palestine after the war. From russia, another 250,000. However, immigration from the arab nations is 700,000.

Also, while both of those groups had Zionist Jews in some leadership positions, the organizations themselves were in no way Zionist-especially at that time, sure when poland was a democracy there were active zionist parties- moreover their goals had nothing to do with zionism. their goals had to do with, obviously, self preservation and fighting back against the Nazis. Jewish Zionist violence implies that the goals of their actions had something to do with the eventual creation of a Jewish state, and in the case of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, that could not have been further from the truth, the uprising happened because these people were on the brink of starvation and death.

If you want to talk about Zionist violence, AKA violent actions taken by people with the intent of aiding in the eventual creation of a Jewish State, Irgun and Lehi are who you want to read up on, as i commented earlier in this thread, those were terrorist organizations fighting against the british occupation, much like the minutemen in america fought against the british occupation 150 years earlier, or the IRA",0,False,1427110218,t3_h16o6,t5_2r8ic,True,israelexposed,0,t1_c1rx7ru,

The price of your travelling will of course vary wildly, Western Europe and Scandanavia especially have a much higher cost to live in than SE Asia for example, although when travelling you can cut costs by living frugally, reading up about potential cheaper alternatives for accomodation or transport and generally planning more (and further in advance)

In general terms, read as much as possible about a destination once your decided on it and learn some of the culture and etiquette, read up on some general safety tips and how not to become a victim of crime or cons e.t.c. (they're rare but the more you know the less at risk you are)

No, you need to start reading.  The Soviet Union lost 12 to 14 million civilians, and 9 to 11 million military personnel.  Since pretty much all the Jews killed in the Holocaust were civilians, I think the relevant statistic is civilian fatalities.  There's a moral difference between killing a combatant who's trying to kill you as well, and killing a civilian who cannot fight back.

&gt;Oh, the idiotic percentage game.

There are two separate crimes here, which combine to turn the ""normal"" brutality of war into genocide.  There's the killing of a person - this is equally bad regardless of the identity of the individual, be they Chinese, or American, or Icelandic, or Jewish.  Then there's the killing of a *people*, the attempt to destroy an ethnic or cultural group.  Here's where the percentages do kinda matter.  It would be a horrible crime to kill, say, 6 million Han Chinese civilians.  It would be a worse crime to kill those 6 million people just because they're Han Chinese.  But doing so doesn't really put the Han Chinese as a group in danger, because there are so many Han Chinese.  The same cannot be said for killing 6 million European Jews - most of the European Jewish communities, especially in Eastern Europe, are still devastated from the Holocaust.  Hence there's an extra crime associated with the Holocaust, because it eliminated 2/3 of the Jewish population.",0,False,1427110261,t3_h1f4v,t5_2qh2p,True,atheism,0,t1_c1rxb3m,

&gt; I emailed Lustig, thanking him for the discussion, and he responded by preaching to me more of his gospel.

See what he's doing here?  He's taking a scientific debate and attacking the person's ability to reason. He's attempting to reduce his opponent's point of view to that of a religious zealot.  

It's reductive and IMO an *ad hominem* attack.

In other places he picks on minor points while ignoring the overall facts.

&gt; In any case, this idea that the Japanese do not add sugar to their diets is completely false –

Well sure, that's true.  But in giving an hour long lecture to nutrition undergrads, he's got to cut corners.  It isn't fair to pick on a minor point like that - when he could easily accept that the typical Japanese diet does not have anywhere near the same levels of added sugar as the North American diet.

He said similar about Europeans.

Aaron's blog post reads like someone who's got an alternative agenda.  Maybe he's trying to get eyeballs on his books, maybe he's in the pocket of the corn-syrup industry, and maybe he's splitting hairs because he's not thinking about the ""big picture"" (on balance, too much Fructose is bad,  at the levels and level of refinement, as it's found in the NA diet, it's bad).

shamansun,1,True,1304289402,c1rxcor,,0,,1,t1_c1rwt41,"Hey @nogood, @sacca. To clarify a bit more, here is another chunk from the McLuhan interview. My only contention with focusing too much on ""transcend and include"" is that it too easily forms into a linear conception of development over time, without taking the rhythmic, *expansive* and *contractive* dimensions into evolution. Will post more thoughts after this:

&gt; **PLAYBOY**: But aren’t there corresponding gains in insight, understanding and cultural diversity to compensate detribalized man for the loss of his communal values?

&gt;**McLUHAN**: Your question reflects all the institutionalized biases of literate man. Literacy, contrary to the popular view of the “civilizing” process you’ve just echoed, creates people who are much less complex and diverse than those who develop in the intricate web of oral-tribal societies. Tribal man, unlike homogenized Western man, was not differentiated by his specialist talents or his visible characteristics, but by his unique emotional blends. The internal world of the tribal man was a creative mix of complex emotions and feelings that literate men of the Western world have allowed to wither or have suppressed in the name of efficiency and practicality. The alphabet served to neutralize all these rich divergencies of tribal cultures by translating their complexities into simple visual forms; and the visual sense, remember, is the only one that allows us to detach; all other senses involve us, but the detachment bred by literacy disinvolves and detribalizes man. He separates from the tribe as a predominantly visual man who shares standardized attitudes, habits and rights with other civilized men. But he is also given a tremendous advantage over the nonliterate tribal man who, today as in ancient times, is hamstrung by cultural pluralism, uniqueness and discontinuity — values that make the African as easy prey for the European colonialist as the barbarian was for the Greeks and Romans. Only alphabetic cultures have ever succeeded in mastering connected linear sequences as a means of social and psychic organization; the separation of all kinds of experiences into uniform and continuous units in order to generate accelerated action and alteration of form — in other words, applied knowledge — has been the secret of Western man’s ascendancy over other men as well as over his environment.

&gt;**PLAYBOY**: Isn’t the thrust of your argument, then, that the introduction of the phonetic alphabet was not progress, as has generally been assumed, but a psychic and social disaster?

&gt;**McLUHAN**: It was both. It try to avoid value judgments in these areas, but there is much evidence to suggest that man may have paid too dear a price for his new environment of specialist technology and values. Schizophrenia and alienation may be the inevitable consequences of phonetic literacy. It’s metaphorically significant, I suspect, that the old Greek myth has Cadmus, who brought the alphabet to man, sowing dragon’s teeth that sprang up from the earth as armed men. Whenever the dragon’s teeth of technological change are sown, we reap a whirlwind of violence. We saw this clearly in classical times, although it was somewhat moderated because phonetic literacy did not win an overnight victory over primitive values and institutions; rather, it permeated ancient society in a gradual, if inexorable, evolutionary process.

The products you use on your body are infused with bits of plant matter from six continents and a chunk of metal floating around Earth's orbit. Your life is at the whim of composite alloys and petrochemicals every time you step into a car and it doesn't automatically explode. 

In a few years, your body will be a mesh of biology and machinery capable of doing things that are little more than science-fiction and superpower right now. Your reality will be augmented, your entertainment artificial, your air supply grown and filtered in a machine. 

You are being rapidly infused with many millions of pieces of information every day. Your most cherished ideals are not your own, your most impassioned opinions cooked up two thousand miles distant and fed to you through space, and everything you know as ""me"" has been engineered in either a temple, a studio, or a corporate office somewhere in Iowa. 

Welcome to the post-modern age. If the above doesn't scare you, stop fucking off and listen because it bloody well should. Everything that makes up ""you"" is being reconfigured, replaced, and regurgitated at a dozen different facilities around the globe. You listen to [post-music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NecFN-cfwlk), you frequent [post-media](http://www.reddit.com/), and sometime within the next few decades you will qualify as post-human. You are nothing more than a product of several hundred agencies that don't know your name and when your meaty core dies and rots you'll live on forever in file cabinets and statistical reports that say you fucking *love* cherry pepsi. 

In the post-modern age, we must adopt post-modern ideals. I am NOT a Briton or a Romanian. I am Caucasian DNA raised on general European nutrients, instilled with western ideals and language, and then fed North American drugs until I become a pile of calcium not easily discernible from that of a Chinese peasant girl from the 1400s. 

You are NOT your passport. You are NOT a name passed down through generations. You are NOT your dominant cultural identity. Your money, your language, your skin colour, and whatever god you worship or don't- it's all superficial bullshit. You might as well be a meat-filled Wikipedia at the mercy of as many editors. 

You are however a human. Regardless of how different our pasts, presents, and futures may be, you and I are of the same species. We have roughly the same physical configuration, for now at least, roughly the same idea of consciousness and self-identity, and the same basic needs. You and me and Clickclick from Ethiopia and Bill Gates and Adolf Hitler and Jesus Christ and every member of the Taliban- we're all human. 

The main post-modern ideal that will come from the 21st century is this. No matter who you are, no matter what clothes you wear or what subgroups you represent, you are above all else a human. We have descended from the same eventual mother, have fostered under the same sun, and one day we will explore the same universe. 

Death to nationhood. It makes us think we're unique, enables war and competition for resources, and distracts us from the greater truth. 

In the twenty-first century, we will see the move toward Rome. Be it under a Caesar or a senate, I don't give a shit- we will become what Rome was meant to be. In Rome, you were not your money or your caste or your culture. You were a citizen of Rome first and all other things second. You ate Roman bread, you were protected by Roman walls, and when called to you defended the city of immigrants to your death because nothing was more important than Rome. 

Maybe this is just my utilitarian side speaking, but I don't care what my leadership looks like. Conservative, liberal, communist, libertarian, man, woman, black, white, a robot in a clown suit that masturbates on playgrounds- the only thing that matters is the realisation and survival of Rome. If we do not unify as a species, the first real threat to our survival will divide and conquer us before a single shot is fired. Be it natural, synthetic, or of some state that I can't even begin to imagine, the first enemy that comes our way will be the death of us because we freak out when someone in Denmark draws an Arab god or want to destroy the entire planet because one half of it believes that property should be equally divided between people and the other half believes that people without property are that way because they're lazy. 

If you want someone to force for a one-world government to happen, force me. Force you. Force every sack of spiced meat on this planet to take a look at themselves and the antithesis of themselves and realise that both have fingerprints. That is the future, that is our golden ticket, and my only enemies in this life are those who would stab whichever Caesar steps up to the plate.

Not true at all what is your source for such a claim? The UK was a dire place to live for the working and middle-classes from about 1980-1997 until the Labour party went back to a revised European socialist model of the 1950s-1960s. The economy was flat lining, trickle-down economics failed, the poor got poorer, the rich got richer. Without Brown and Blairs' socialist-lite policies the UK would have certainly remained the same. 

The UK's right-wing party, though they have been critical of some spending, the Conservatives have openly praised the way the Labour party breathed life into the economy and have now become a more left wing party.

I think what you're trying to suggest is that I'm making some sort of false *post-hoc* analysis. When you study the economy of the UK, you will see that under a long period of sustained period of nearly 20 years of laissez-faire leadership the disparity between rich and poor was increased and poverty was on the rise. Only 2 years after the Labour party came in, the trend was reversed; jobs were created, poverty decreased. No one who knows anything about UK politics would ever tell you otherwise either left or right.

A general rule is, if someone is explaining why they slaughtered people by the thousand and used their bodies to terrorize the rest, you should hesistate to believe what they say, except where the victim's side agrees with them. The tendency to demonize the victims with lies and exaggerations is near-universal among genocidal political opressors; I would include my ancestors in that (or rather, the people ordering my ancestors about, because my ancestors would pretty much all be English peasant stock). That huge numbers were terribly slaughtered, that is true. That the victims were all or even largely non-Christian, as Raleigh says - I don't see how that can be true. It's inconsistent with what we know about Irish history.

In this case I was pretty well aware of the basics of the history of Ireland, including roughly by when it was almost all Christian, having read about the history in a humorous (but also mostly reasonably accurate) book by an Australian humourist of Irish descent many years ago. I double checked a few details when I posted (and made a couple of minor additions), but it was basically on track.

Just having a quick glance at the site you pointed to. Most of what I can see of the first screenful is consistent with my limited knowledge, based on what I have read of European history, but I'm not the guy to ask if you want solid confirmation. It's often easy to say when something is inaccurate (since one only needs counter-examples). It's much harder to say something is accurate.

to give an example of the sort of thing I can say:

&gt; The temple at Uppsala (Sweden) is destroyed, and construction of a church on the site is initiated.

I don't know the details of this incident, but this practice (destroy a temple, build a church on its ruins) was absolutely standard practice pretty much everywhere people were colonized or conquered from the earliest days of Christian political power until roughly the Enlightenment or maybe even later. I have read of this happening over and over in many different places.

A rough and dirty explanation for you: Jews, since well before the time of Jesus had not had a homeland. They were a people held together by their religion, but did not have a place of their own since biblical times. They were always considered the ""other,"" a minority that had always called themselves the ""Jewish People"" in stead of a member of their respected monarchy/empire.

Then came the age of Christianity, who among other things, directly blamed the Jewish people for killing their messiah and refusing to convert to what they believed to be the new and superior religion. Remember: a driving force for Christianity is the call to spread their faith to all corners of the earth.

One thing that is important to understand though is that anti-semitism only came into existence in the mid to late 1800's as Jews across Europe started to become emancipated. Prior to that it was different, it was blind Jew Hatred.

I guess you could define anti-semitism as being a movement based on racial theory.

In Last Window, you have one month to move out of your apartment building, when you receive a strange request to find ""The Red Star"". Each of the games features a unique art style with smooth animations. The stories are captivating, and the gameplay slow yet suitable for this genre.

I am in a bit of a bind here. I am part of a student group at a Canadian university in which we're building a zero emission hydrogen fuel cell vehicle to race internationally. My position is head of Corporate Relations, essentially obtaining sponsorship for our project (~$300,000 total per car), and until yesterday things had been running very smoothly. 

Myself and a couple of other students prepared the content for a sponsorship package, although the visual aspects of the packages were passed off to a graphic/industrial design student. Over the past 9 weeks we've been perpetually promised a draft of said package, which has never came, and we've thus pushed back the deadline. The last deadline was supposed to be April 24th, but as I found out yesterday, not only had they not started it, but they were going to be in Europe on vacation for the next 3 weeks, so there was zero chance of even getting it before the end of April.

Without this package we essentially have to push back our meetings with potential corporate sponsors a full month if we rely on this irresponsible student who was previously working on this, so we've decided to give it our best shot internally.

This is a double edged sword, on the one hand it means that customers will have confidence that when they buy traditional medicines they are buying something proven.  However on the other hand the cost of these preparations will increase considerably and also smaller labs will be put out of business as only the larger suppliers will be able to pay the EU fees.  In a way this legislation is big business friendly.

On balance it probably is a good thing but in a way it's just another tax to pay for the EU bureaucracy.",0,False,1427110532,t3_h1j5z,t5_2qh13,True,worldnews,0,t1_c1rxvub,

BlueRock,72,True,1304296009,c1rxwq4,,0,,72,t1_c1rxlts,"&gt; Believe me when I say that the wind wreaks havoc on the grid.

It's funny how what I read on the internet often doesn't match what I read from credible sources, e.g.:

* Spain’s variable wind and stable electricity networks. ""Grids need to match supply and demand precisely, the critics say, and because wind varies so much it causes huge problems. Recent data from two meteorologically unusual days in Spain – the world leader in the management of renewable energy supplies – shows this assertion is almost certainly false."" http://www.carboncommentary.com/2009/11/15/853

* A study commissioned by the state of Minnesota considered penetration of up to 25%, and concluded that integration issues would be manageable and have incremental costs of less than one-half cent ($0.0045) per kW·h. http://www.puc.state.mn.us/docs/windrpt_vol%201.pdf

&gt; ...is sometimes pushing the grid into failure.. 

Except when it's helping to save the grid:

* Texas rolling blackouts saved by wind: ""I would highlight that we put out a special word of thanks to the wind community because they did contribute significantly through this time frame. Wind was blowing, and we had often 3,500 megawatts of wind generation during that morning peak, which certainly helped us in this situation."" http://www.texastribune.org/texas-energy/energy/an-interview-with-the-ceo-of-the-texas-grid/

And if wind was such a massive problem, why is it being deployed faster than any other energy source in many countries?

* USA: at 35 Percent of New Capacity, Wind Moves From Alternative to Mainstream. AWEA’s annual report shows that wind represents a third of the nation’s new power and that the industry has had an average annual growth of 35 percent for five years. http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/is-wind-still-an-alternative-energy/

* Wind power's growth is blowing Europe toward green goals. Europe is installing more wind power capacity than any other form of energy, and wind is leading the way to making the continent's electricity generation 100% renewable by 2050.

Then you have the Regional List, used for the EU and most of Europe, where you have large multi-member constituencies.

Then there's STV, used in Ireland, which again has large multi-member constituencies and uses preferential voting. The result is highly proportional and fair, but the process is way too long and complicated for me to go into at half one in the morning. (And for that reason probably too complicated for your average Joe and would certainly need computers to count votes - many people are weary of this).

My favourite - AV+, which is where you elect a local MP using AV, and then the rest of the votes are counted to create top-up MPs, who have no constituency link and make it so the share of the votes are proportional. Not used anywhere (AFAIK), but was outlined by the Jenkins report commissioned by Blair as the best electoral system for Westminster.

AMS - same as AV+ but using FPTP instead of AV. Used in Wales and Scotland for devolved Assembly/Parliament elections.

And those are the ones that I'm most versed in, but my point is that PR isn't always the simplest, and it's a pretty broad term to be bandied about as one system.

I recall actually ON the Honda MAC, we were going a steady but reasonably rapid pace which, for my skills-set at the time was toward my upper end. We were passed on a long straight by a guy on an R1 and two blades - one early, and going by the tail probably a fox-eye, and the other was contemporary. They were so late on the brakes past my instructor just to make it past him that they were dangerously close to not making the bend. And they then held us up slightly around a sequence of corners. The next straight they were stretching their legs.

The instructor's voice came over the radio telling me to ""follow the signs to Wensleydale, then the brown signs for the tea rooms... I'm going to have some fun..."" and he set off after them. At one point as the road swept a certain way down then up and around some bends, I saw him draft past them with ease. In a Pan European laden with first aid kit, radio gear, course literature, and so on. Awesome sight and helped the penny drop that doing what he was teaching me and doing it right, it didn't matter what I rode so much, because I could be smoother and faster than most, and still be a hell of a lot safer.  Taught me SO much. And put it into good use too :)

I've had fun on track, but wouldn't want to do it all the time. Fun to learn a bit more about the bike at closer to its (and my) limits, in relative safety, but in the end it's just getting pissed off as someone with more power and torque blasts past on a straight, then gets in the way wobbling round a corner.

In the car I've not had formal training beyond the basic test, but a friend at the gym I went to in my late teens was a traffic officer and he used to teach me a bit now and then when the chance arose. Things like when it snowed once, he called me up said ""Borrow your parents car, pick me up, we're off to have some fun"". So in a rattly old Montego we went off to a brand new supermarket's car park, nearly midnight, and had our private skid pan to teach me on. Lots of other examples too but I won't bore you with them. I was VERY lucky to have him as a friend. I'll miss him :(  (died of cancer about 7 years ago).

HGV driving is pretty good, too, in a way, for the skills on bike and in car. There's a LOT you learn about handling through those big old monsters that don't seem relevant but you break things down and you can figure much out. And also oddly enough it teaches you that slowly slowly catchy monkey, and that you can have fun without going nutso warp speed. So you can go slower, save fuel, and get to your destination just as quick by planning your drive better on the go... and so discipline becomes a sort of game to play on the go.

The skills for reading the road on a bike and in a truck aren't that dissimilar, and even things like speed management too. On top of the MAC course, for sure becoming a trucker improved my riding skills too.  (That sounds bizarre, I know!)

I do agree that evangelising has a real impact on wiping out cultures. From a scholarly point of view (and as a very small history buff), yes, cultures should be preserved, at least by informing the newer generations that peoples observed this ritual or worshipped that god. However, I think that the modern century idea of globalisation is just as harmful. A lot of countries have a lot of the same aspects because of economic globalisation.

The reason for evangelism (and I'm saying this outside of being a Christian personally) is you essentially try to convince people your way is better. As a Christian, obviously I believe that God is a real but currently intangible deity, the only deity, and that Jesus did die to save the soul of man, that people need to hear about it, etc. As a person living in the 21st century, I also believe that you shouldn't live without modern plumbing or electricity. It's really up to you to decide what you'll take in.

Second question... I think I merged that a bit with the first one.... In Europe and wherever you find a Western influence I suppose, there's this thing called the post-apostolic era going on. This is the (current) period in time in which people just aren't interested in hearing the Christian Gospel. In poorer countries, coincidentally where people haven't heard of Christ, the people are more receptive. I think it has to do with the fact that westerners don't feel the need to be humble and to say that they need someone else. Also, with the ""go and preach"" bit, you should have an honest desire to serve God and have a burden to help the people you want to witness to. It is a commandment for Christians, but it's not like ""Do this or you'll burn in hell forever!""

&gt;The European Commission has commissioned a study on the likely economic effects of the proposed Canada - EU Trade Agreement.  The report includes a detailed analysis on the likely effects of the intellectual property provisions in the agreement.

The same source as yours, except the economic principles I adhere to are superior to yours.

&gt;The UK was a dire place to live for the working and middle-classes from about 1980-1997 until the Labour party went back to a revised European socialist model of the 1950s-1960s.

The UK dramatically increased in living standards from 1980-1997.

&gt;The economy was flat lining, trickle-down economics failed, the poor got poorer, the rich got richer. 

Untrue.  

&gt;Without Brown and Blairs' socialist-lite policies the UK would have certainly remained the same.

It would have continued to improve, instead of stagnating like it has.

&gt;The UK's right-wing party, though they have been critical of some spending, the Conservatives have openly praised the way the Labour party breathed life into the economy and have now become a more left wing party.

The Labor party did not breathe life into the economy.  They sucked the air out.

&gt;I think what you're trying to suggest is that I'm making some sort of false post-hoc analysis.

I'm not suggesting it, I'm explicitly declaring it.

&gt;When you study the economy of the UK, you will see that under a long period of sustained period of nearly 20 years of laissez-faire leadership the disparity between rich and poor was increased and poverty was on the rise. 

Inequality does not imply lowering living standards, and poverty was on the rise because of growing government involvement.

&gt;Only 2 years after the Labour party came in, the trend was reversed; jobs were created, poverty decreased. 

More jobs would have been created, and poverty would have been even lower had the Labor Party not come in, and had the Conservative Party shrunk government instead of growing it.

That's... it's horrible. And the European Jews of the '30s went through that.

I can sit here and watch stupid arguments on YouTube and not have to worry about this stuff but somewhere out there, that is someone's reality. Somewhere out there, *right now,* there are wars being fought based solely on ethnicity or nationality or religion. People are doing *unspeakable* things to each other on this planet. Things that actually make the Holocaust seem kind of tame. Now, like you said: everyone had it rough during World War II. A lot of people had it worse than the Jews, actually. Civilians in Berlin and Russia got it real bad. Like... damn, it was bad. Jesus Christ. But at least those horrific acts had a sort of context to them. Germany and Russia were at war. That, in its way, made sense. But being torn from your homes and families to be forced into camps? Because of where you go to church? Why, because some man said Jews were ""inferior""? You know, even the shit in Palestine kind of makes sense. Even if it is a racial and religious thing-- and it is-- it still has this veneer of ""Oh, we Israelis need to protect ourselves.""

If it happened once... well, like I said, it's been happening, just not to the same people. I'm not sure how all of this relates to your argument, except that I would add that not *every* Jew uses the Holocaust as a political argument.

We had a balcony and everyone kept their doors open. Fuck everything about living on your own abroad. That's not an experience. VSE's dorms are one of those things that bother me when I realize I'll never experience them again in my life.

Here are some quick-read blog posts I wrote for my school's abroad blog:

* [The Balcony: A first step in any healthy roommate relationship.](http://bbaabroad.wordpress.com/2009/11/21/the-balcony-a-first-step-in-any-healthy-roommate-relationship/): Talks about the dorm and roommates situation. Truly legendary.
* [Why Prague Should be your #1 Choice](http://bbaabroad.wordpress.com/2009/10/26/why-prague-should-be-your-1-choice/): My impression after a month in Prague.

I was clearly intoxicated by Prague when I wrote those. Still am.

**You don't need to learn Czech**. Beyond the fact that foreign youth knows English, Prague is a metro capital that expects foreigners, but foreign language is never an obstacle.

Being surrounded by foreign communication that you can't understand is one of the purest pleasures in life as is the stranger in a stranger land phenomenon. It's never a barrier because the menial communication in a day doesn't demand a common language when you can play charades with your hands. And you'd be surprised how much information you can convey just by modulating the pitch of a grunt. 

I did everything from open a checking account to rent a car in Prague without a problem. My Swedish friend and I then took that car far outside of contractual bounds around eastern europe without a problem. Booked the smallest hostel in the smallest towns without a problem. Had flings with girls that hardly spoke English without a problem. Language barriers are overstated. Your Czech buddy + VSE handles any bureaucracy for you. And if you ever need language help, no matter where I am in the world, there's never been a shortage of genuine bystanders that will help you.

Appending to the car rental note:** We paid like 110 euros for a week around europe in an Opel Corsa including gas**. One of the highest moments of my life. So many stories from that, like stubbornly avoiding the toll roads in Slovenia and ending up on top of a random [snow-top mountain pass](http://a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/15840_1034473157266_1688550103_116317_3490401_n.jpg).

Well you can't make a road out of wind.  I'm not sure why you think that's a subsidy. 

&gt; I live in Europe where there are lots of places with roads that were not originally designed for cars and it's very obvious.

ok, but what does that have to do with anything? 

&gt; but lots of development went into long distance and wartime technology and it's incredibly difficult to undo a technology choice.

But because there has been evolution and the current market conditions - costs, demand, usage characteristics and so on - favor a particular *leader* among the available options, does not imply that there is an existing subsidy.  

That the investment in roads has benefited oil companies, is also not evidence of a subsidy. The vehicles could have been *anything*, but oil-powered internal-combustion engines won the day. 

That electric vehicles ""lost"" in the market (up to this point in time) is also not evidence of a subsidy.  Yes, electric cars have been around forever, but today the flexibility, and cost of an ICE is far ahead of a pure electric vehicle.  This seems likely to change, but for now, full electric vehicles are not mainstream, because they are not as good.

2.  I think I finally understand the source of our disagreement.  I don't view the ASPO graph as unrealistic.  It is what you and I deduce from that graph, and the assumptions we use for those deductions, that cause us to disagree.

You see the graph, and you see a gradual decline, which is a reasonable thing to see.  I see the graph, and I think in economic terms, namely supply and demand.  Even if we assume demand matches supply at present (it won't, it will continue to grow), we have a situation where each passing year means a further separation of supply and demand.  This means a *continually* increasing price of oil.  No more plateaus.  This means a completely halted economy because the cost of producing anything that requires oil and the cost of transporting anything becomes prohibitively expensive.

You might point to this as confirmation that alternatives will be priced into feasibility.  I would disagree.  If the price of energy from any source were, for example, twice what we pay now, that would cause all of our discretionary income to be redirected to energy.  That simply results in a permanent depression.  

&gt;it is an article that asks us to imagine the oil supply suddenly being cut to zero which I think is unrealistic

MOST PEOPLE ON THIS PLANET ARE LIVING INA TOTAL PHANTASY WORLD. 

and thats all there is to it. weather it be religion, or govt. 

which is why things are so fucked up i suppose. you have to figure they governmentallised religion back with the holy roman empire, then calvinisim became teh CofE because it allowed for usury (conveinient for the european banking sect)

so until the last few hundred years govt was led by the cult directly. now its made up of members of the cult, or at least was for a long time. 

now as a rep, of these cult members, i have to play along with their phantasy. can you imagine a politican running on the 'your all a bunch of fucking idiots' platform? 

and this is why things are fucked, because its the ignorant people that become teh demographic and the congregation. and thats nearly a quarter of teh population that are just dumb as a bag of hammers. 

but that base line is what politicans and cults use to peer pressure others into 'well maybe they are right'

[deleted],4,False,1304305969,c1ryslp,,0,,4,t3_h1q8j,"I strongly agree that you do other shorter trips first. Where are you planning to go?

For your pack, this strongly depends on what you'll be doing. Just 'backpacking' around cities, you won't need much. Some extended treks? A bit more. Anything in winter or technical climbs, a lot more. For the first two, 40-60L packs would be best. I like to travel light, and 40L is enough for me, though it gets tight while picking up souvenirs.

For clothes, I want to totally recommend Ex Officio for underwear. You can wash them with a bit of shampoo and they'll be dry within the hour after you wring them out. Look for quick-drying pants and shirts-- they'll be made of synthetics which wick water and sweat well. For pants, get a couple of convertible hiking pants-- pants and shorts in one. Socks, same deal. Smart wool is a great choice. Heavier weight if winter/lots of hiking, lighter if not.

I like to hike in lighter shoes. 1 lb on your feet is about 5 lb on your back, and it's really true. (I just saw the study abstract in r/ultralight today in fact).

I use cameras that run on AAs only. No need to worry about bringing a charger as AAs can be found everywhere.

I've seen lots of people with netbooks/ipads when traveling, but the only things I carry that use electricity are my camera and headlamp. I wait until I go home until I get back in touch with people and upload photos. For simple ""I'm still alive"" emails, there are plenty of e-mail cafes around the world.

Solar panel? I might be biased because I like to go lightweight, but this is not for me. Then again, I met some Australians who used one to keep their iphone charged and they liked it. It took about 6 hours to charge though.....

Water purification is pretty much a must. Aqua Mira drops are my preferred system, though I haven't used the UV systems that are increasing in popularity. Just mix a little of part A and B, and dump into your water. Wait an hour and drink.

For vaccines and visas, check the US travel website. Google ""countryname visa requirements"" and it'll be the first hit. It'll tell you if you need a visa, the duration, and what shots you'll need. Be warned, it's very conservative with medical information and you might not need all the shots they'll list. Lonely Planets forums are a great place to check for practical matters on this sort of thing (visa + vaccines). You can assume if you're traveling through South America, or Asia, you WILL need to get visas and you WILL need vaccines. Visas also cost money and can take time to get, so you should plan ahead on this.

Sleeping bag? They're rated by temperature. If you won't be getting rained on much, go with down if you can afford it, otherwise synthetic. Go to a store like REI and try them on. They come in various shapes and widths and lengths. I can't wait to get a longer bag as I'm 6'9"" and have a ""long"" bag now.... :(

For money, I hate carrying a lot of cash on me at once. I much prefer to make withdrawls on a weekly basis and just each the foreign transaction fees. I learned recently some banks don't have them (Schwab I think?) I need to look into this myself.

Money belt? Only if you don't think there will be room in your fanny pack, Rick Steves.

My best advice? Get a decent sized pack (40-60L), about 4 days of clothes (4 pants, 4 shirts, etc.), a container to carry water, and start off in Australia or Europe. Some place where a number of people speak English and the culture shock won't be too much. See if you like traveling. Also, it'll buy you time to arrange visas so you can start sooner.

* They live in a part of the world where minority religions tend to get persecuted.  Westerners tend to take for granted a view of history where, until recently, religious minorities are always getting persecuted.  It's just in our nature.  We forget that many parts of the world, especially the East, have societies that are historically much more tolerant of minorities.  China, to take one example, has had multiple competing religions which have co-existed fairly peacefully for large chunks of their history.  Can you think of a single post-Roman European country that would have allowed multiple religions for so long?  It's also worth noting that Jews living in Muslim countries were treated much better than they were in European countries.  So one reason Jews get persecuted is because Europeans are jerks. 

* Jews are arguably the first socialists.  Learning how to read has been a religious requirement for millennia.  Synagogues and temples are publicly financed schools, cultural centers and social welfare providers.  This tradition is one of the big reasons for the community's resilience  and its ability to thrive in the face of tremendous odds.  Unfortunately, this strength has also fed a cycle of petty jealousy and resentment by host-cultures.

* Finally I just want to mention that in our more tolerant times, there are many minority groups in various situations who are victimized by a similar kind of persecution, but who also thrive for similar reasons: They keep their old traditions intact, they stick together, and they gain strength from hardship.",0,False,1427110989,t3_h1npt,t5_2qh53,True,history,0,t1_c1ryuq6,

The hardest part of your question is to balance between stopping in one place and taking the time to see &amp; appreciate it well vs driving lots to superficially see lots of places. I'll put up some suggestions and let you work it out from there.

* You are in luck with the Autumn tree display. The European trees in many parts of Canberra have changed to yellows, reds &amp; browns. The leaves should stay on for another week, in time for you to catch them.

* There is the [National Zoo &amp; Aquarium](http://nationalzoo.com.au/) in Canberra. It isn't big on Australian animals, so I wouldn't make it a priority.

* The [Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve](http://www.tams.act.gov.au/play/pcl/parks_reserves_and_open_places/national_parks/tidbinbilla_nature_reserve) might be more your thing. It has emus, kangaroos, koalas &amp; other native animals.

* I love [Kosciuszko National Park](http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/nationalparks/parkhome.aspx?id=N0018). In your circumstance, I would recommend catching the chairlift up [Thredbo ski resort](http://www.thredbo.com.au/) and walking to Mt Kosciuszko, the highest peak on the Australian mainland. Make sure you take adequate clothing. At this time of year you could easily get caught in a snow storm. There is accommodation at Thredbo (too much to link to - just Google it).
Thredbo is about a 3 hour drive from Canberra. You will mostly be going through the Monaro plain, which is a lot like the area in the lee of the (big mountain range in NZ) such as Lake Tekapo. It is dry, generally treeless and rolling.

* There are several national parks within a few hours drive of Canberra. Morton National Park, Namagdi National Park, the Brindabellas, to name a few.

* Bateman's Bay is the nearest coastal town, at about 2 1/2 hours drive away. It is a river outlet and the beach is unremarkable. For beaches, head North or South for about 1/2 hour and stop when you see something nice. When I was last at [Pebbly Beach](http://maps.google.com.au/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Pebbly+Beach,+New+South+Wales&amp;aq=0&amp;sll=-25.335448,135.745076&amp;sspn=50.244513,72.246094&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Pebbly+Beach+New+South+Wales&amp;z=14), a long time ago, there was a lawn that was kept mown by the friendly Eastern Gray kangaroos.

&gt; Recommendations for car hire companies?

The national brands in Canberra are Avis, Budget, Hertz &amp; Europcar.
There are also local companies, if you want to give them a go.
[Yellow Pages](http://www.yellowpages.com.au/search/listings?clue=car+hire&amp;locationClue=Canberra+ACT&amp;x=45&amp;y=19) will give you a start. I don't hire cars often enough to recommend one company over another, so will need to do your own research on that bit.

&gt; CHINA’S children may be dying from tainted milk but the country’s leaders are dining on pure organic ingredients. Like the emperors of old, the new communist elite enjoy the finest produce from all over China, sourced by a high-security government department. 
&gt;
&gt; The revelation has provoked anger among the public and embarrassment for the leadership as it battles a food scandal that has further damaged the country’s reputation. 
&gt;
&gt; Chinese milk products have been banned by the European Union and the state media have admitted that one child in 20 in Shanghai may now have kidney damage as a result of drinking contaminated formula milk. 
&gt;
&gt; No such peril lies in wait, however, for the members of China’s political elite. 
&gt;
&gt; Their diet includes beef from cattle that have grazed on the pesticide-free pastures of inner Mongolia and fish from the crystalline rivers and lakes of Hubei province in central China. They dine on rice that costs 15 times the price of the ordinary grain; as well it might, being grown on the slopes of a mountain near North Korea and irrigated by clear waters from melting snows. 
&gt;
&gt; They sip tea brewed with the most delicate leaves from lofty plantations on the fringe of the Tibetan plateau. It costs more than £100 a pound. 
&gt;
&gt; The task of selecting the best falls to a body known as the State Council Central Government Bureau Special Food Supply Centre. It caters for the dietary needs of the senior leaders such as President Hu Jintao who, foreign diplomats say, is a diabetic. 
&gt;
&gt; “To care for the health of elderly officials, we consider healthy food a special task,” said Zhu Yonglan, the centre’s director, in a recent speech. 
&gt;
&gt; “For security we insist food is approved by scientists for no contamination or chemical additives and there must be a quality audit right down the food chain to the provider.” 
&gt;
&gt; The text of Zhu’s speech was removed from a biotech company website hours after the People’s Daily published a denial that either the centre or Zhu existed. “That news is fabricated,” it said. 
&gt;
&gt; Bloggers then published its address at 12 Dongtu Road, in Beijing’s Chaoyang district, named the police-owned farms that it used, and said it supplied 94 individual officials. 

I reckon the most likely explanation is that the company exist(ed) but the website and speech were pulled once people found out about it.

Edit: AP covered the story too

Of course not. What I'm saying is that it was never done in my country the first place. Do you think circumcision was something all humans did at some point and eventually grew out out of? 

Let me tell you a bit about the history of this practice: 

The tradition of circumcision your people cherish and enjoy today started somewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, where many different forms of bodily mutilation have been practiced by different tribes for many different reasons. 

Whether through war, trade or slavery this practice reached Egypt where it acquired religious significance. Where further south male circumcision was done as rite of passage for all young men, it now became a religious ceremony where only the priesthood and the highest echelons of society were circumcised in exchange for secret prayers and rituals. 

From Egypt circumcision spread to the people of the Levant and eventually the Israelites who would bring this wonderful gift to the the Western world. Keep in mind that the two major lineages, so to speak, of circumcision that exist today diverged a very long time ago. The people of the Middle East were already practicing circumcision before Islam and continued to do so after. Where the Jews brought circumcision to Britain and from there to the rest of the commonwealth countries—The United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa—Islam spread it all throughout Africa, Southern Europe and as far east as Indonesia. 

Today circumcision has almost disappeared in most of the secular West with the exception of the United States, but remains as popular as ever in the Muslim world. Even in the US the rate of circumcision is currently estimated to be as low as 30% percent, though those figures do not count circumcisions not paid through insurance; the actual numbers are anywhere between 30% and 50%. So while it is true that the practice will probably have diet out by the end of the century, even in the cut-happy US, millions of boys will still have been victimized. I strongly believe any path that accelerates this trend is worth pursuing. 

When the Chinese attempted to ban foot binding, the people were so reluctant that the authorities actually had to threaten those that continued doing with death. Obviously I'm not advocating that approach but I think this shows you just how attached people can be to their traditions, no matter how unspeakably cruel.

As an addendum: there is actually another completely isolated lineage of circumcision practiced by Australian and New Guinean aborigines. These people also practice some of the most horrific types of male genital mutilation, including subincision—where the penis is cut open along the urethra like a fileted fish.

No apology necessary, I happen to think your English is quite good.  

Now, on to the meat of your complaint. While I am usually all for showing proof, people in power are quite familiar with the phrase ""plausible deniability,"" and Pope John Paul II was no exception.  


So, there is no *ABSOLUTE* proof; no smoking gun, but then, we do have a mountain of circumstantial evidence, and enough circumstantial evidence does lead you to certain conclusions...  

To start off, there is Maciel, a priest found guilty of sexual abuse of former members, as well as having children out of wedlock with women with whom he maintained long-term relationships. All of that ignored by John Paul II; when nine people accuse the guy of abusing them as kids, the least you can do is investigate. Or rather that *should* be the least you can do, it however, was not the *least* that John Paul could do. To quote Maureen Dowd of The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/24/opinion/24dowd.html?_r=1&amp;ref=maureendowd), “Cardinals and bishops had told him about the larger abuse crisis for years. And he was passive to an absolute fault. He failed in mountainous terms.”   

Then there is the report from the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12222612) about the letter signed by the late Archbishop Luciano Storero, Pope John Paul II's envoy to Ireland wherein the Vatican department advised Ireland's Catholic bishops in 1997 not to report priests suspected of child abuse to the police rejected an initiative to begin the ""mandatory reporting"" of abuse claims. But we are supposed to swallow the idea that John Paul knew nothing about what was being done by his envoys.  
  
From [CNN](http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/04/27/abuse-crisis-fuels-debate-over-john-paul-iis-legacy/) we have a Colombian Cardinal whom John Paul tapped to head a Vatican office responsible for policy questions about the priesthood, Darío Castrillón Hoyos, actually wrote to a French bishop in 2001 to congratulate him for refusing to report a priest charged with abuse.  

In the same CNN article, there is the report of a similar case that involves Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer of Vienna, Austria, who died in 2003. Groer resigned in 1995 after facing charges of abuse, but was not subjected to a church penalty. In May 2010, Groer’s successor as Cardinal of Vienna, Christoph Schonborn, said that a top official under John Paul II had blocked the investigation.  

Next there is the case of [Cardinal Bernard Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Francis_Law#Sexual_abuse_scandal), who presided over terrible scandals in Boston and is wanted by a grand jury. He became the first individual be shown to have actively participated in the cover-up of child molestation. You would think that a pope who wished to end the crisis would have sacked Law, and ordered him to return to face the grand jury, but then that isn't what happened. Instead, he resides in Rome. (This would be just as damning a statement about the current Pope as it would about John Paul II.)   

Then we have the interview with Cardinal Schönborn in which he stated that he sat directly opposite John Paul and pleaded with him to make a statement about Cardinal Groër, the Fatima molester that John Paul had appointed, against the advice of the bishops of Austria, to the see of Vienna.   

Moving on, we get to [The Times](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article7121062.ece) article about Cardinal Schönborn, 65, seen as a possible future Pope, and his accusation that Cardinal Angelo Sodano, 82, the former Vatican Secretary of State (Prime Minister), of having blocked investigations into sex abuse crimes committed by his predecessor in Vienna, the late Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer.  

etc., etc., etc. Just a constant drum beat of stories about how all the powerful people in high offices surrounding John PPPaul II, and often directly appointed by John Paul II are frustrating investigations, covering up abuse, and directing church members to keep things in the church instead of going to the secular authorities.  


I mean, yeah, sure there is no absolute proof that John Paul was the man directing all the cover ups, just because John Paul II appointed the men who did the dirty work to high office doesn't mean that he knew what they were doing. Just because he holds all but absolute power in the Vatican doesn't mean that they were following his orders. But I believe that he was ignorant of all that the same way I ""believe"" that Ken Lay of Enron fame was ignorant of the illegal activities at his company.

The big hoop to jump through in the US is getting accepted to a school, then you declare a major after you're accepted. In order to get accepted, you'll need to take the SAT or ACT, which are a sort of placement exams, they just show how much you know.

The seal with the eagle, stars and stripes, the pyramid with the Eye of Providence, even the font for the denomination - those are all strictly American currency imagery.  Even setting aside all the other MAJOR show-stoppers for a common currency, there's no way Canada or Mexico could approve those designs.

Second, America itself would never replace the Presidents on the currency with American Federal Reserve founders.  If Canada had to replace its currency's Prime Ministers and monarch, it wouldn't be for another country's leaders - so it most certainly wouldn't do it for another country's lesser bureaucrats.  

Third, a common currency by definition means *scrapping* the Federal Reserve - any common currency would be jointly managed by all three countries.  This makes putting the founders of the Fed on the currency, and an image of the signing of the Federal Reserve Act on the back of the $1 note, a rather silly idea.

Then there’s the name of this union. There could be more than one common name, but ONLY the official name would be on the currency. The front of this note says “The United Federation of North America”. The back says “The North American Union”. The small print says “Union of the North American Republic”. Pick ONE. (And an EU style union is still separate countries. It’s NOT a republic.)

For all the claims about an ""Amero by 2007!!!"", the conspiracy theorists have yet to identify a single politician in the US or Canada who wants it.  They've yet to find any sign of legislation for it coming down the pipeline in any country.  They've yet to come up with credible reasoning why Canada would adopt it at the best of times, let alone when the US has been committing economic suicide.

Aw. too bad. 

Also, I'm 33 and I've been at UW for 15 years - as much as I'd like to be an undergrad in Chem I'm just not that cool anymore. 

So - I'm bored, I have papers to grade and I decide to look through your post history and I find some fun stuff.

1. you think private industry makes most of the medical advancements (which you'd know wasn't true if you really did do a BS in Bio and a masters in genetics)
2. you're pro-life (which suggests you didn't pay attention during developmental biology)
3. you state:

&gt;Hmm, I guess that economics masters I received from a top school in this country is worthless

Which seems highly suspicious given you've also got a masters in Genetics!

4. you think private schools are where all the research gets done, lulz

5. you state:

&gt;Every scientific breakthrough in medicine is done in the United State.

which, if you're really in medical school you'd know to be *very* false. The EU has been ahead of the US in genetic disorder research for a *very* long time, and thats only the tip of the iceberg. The US sucks for epidemiology, something you'd also know if you were really in med school.

6. You argued with people about stem cell research...and said lots of things that make it clear you don't know what a cell line is. GG. You never got a BS in bio.

7. you state:

&gt;If this happens, I am moving myself and my small business out of the United States.

Oh whats that?

Uhuh, I thought you were in med school? That was posted 17 days ago. Wait, there's more!

&gt;I am almost half your age old man, run my own small business, and employ 7 people with benefits. I grew up in poverty and paid my own way through school.

But, but but...I thought you went to some top private school? You paid your way through 25k a year? Rofl. 

8. Tell me, oh master of genetics - what does 9:3:3:1 tell you? What kind of cross would you perform to test for linkage? QUICK! GO COPYPASTA FROM WIKI!



So, lets recap - you've got a BA in econ, a master's in genetics, a BS in bio, a master in econ and you're in med school and have a small business. Its really funny because you've got posts where you call out people for being BS artists, ah, the hypocrisy.

&gt;It's amazing how many PhDs who attended Harvard/Yale/insert some ivy league school here are on the interwebz.

YES! It is, isn't it?

Now, lets talk about endocrine disruptors - as someone with a master's in the biological sciences I'm sure I'll find your input *refreshing*.

Nearly ten years of conflicts, thousands of American and civilian lives lost, billions, if not trillions, of dollars spent into this economic sinkhole which has done nothing to help the American economy or the national debt, and it's not a quagmire at all? 

Its helped the military-industrial complex, creating a metric ton of defense- and intelligence-related jobs. You're coming from the viewpoint that being a hegemonic military superpower wielding substantial public and private interests across the globe is an inherently bad thing. 


&gt;Wars are expensive, economically regressive, cost people and materiel, and what have we accomplished? Toppling regimes in which we're largely to foot the bill for the forseeable future. Don't be surprised if there's no general withdrawal under Obama's administration, even if this was Bush's mess.

Wars are also inevitable. Iran? North Korea? I think there's a better than break-even chance that we'll see active conflicts in those regions within our lifetimes. Mankind has yet to find a geopolitical issue a few bullets couldn't solve.

&gt;See part of my point above, though I am in agreement that entitlement spending will economically ruin this country unless there are hard sacrifices to be made for financial and economic solvency for this nation. Inflationary spending and borrowing merely defers the pain to a point where can no longer be deferred.

Eh. We could default tomorrow and the world would keep spinning. The U.S. ain't perfect, but we're still the best game in town. China has its own economic issues to deal with and has been perfectly content in sullying its global interests with a disregard for intellectual property and human rights. The EU? They can start preaching about fiscal conservatism when they clean up the mess with Greece, Portugal and Ireland. They can only hang on to Germany's coattails for so long.

&gt; However, what better way is there to convince the average person of America's true aggressive and interventionist nature than the examples of Iraq and Afghanistan?

Frankly, most Arabs and the vast majority of Middle Easterners I've met care about the same shit we all do - a good job and a loving family. Its kind of naive to think that geopolitics is such a predominant topic of conversation with regular folks. 

&gt; You honestly don't think that this country has significantly more liberties and protections under the Constitution since the passage of the PATRIOT Act?

Meh. I have about as much of a problem with the PATRIOT Act as I did with FISA. Which is, really, not much of a problem. I understand the academic and legal debate, but it has absolutely no practical impact on my life.

Look into big name tourist attractions as well as not so big name attractions.  Figure out where and which places you want to go and then prepare your plan around that.  May I also suggest not to go with a tourist company's pre-made plan because then it is *their* trip, not *your* trip.  However, don't hesitate to take a look at them for ideas for destinations.  Have a pretty good idea as to what your accommodations will be and if there may be any major events that would make it hard to acquire somewhere to sleep safely.

Make sure let your family and friends know your travel plans so you can ""check in"" along the way.  Report in if you're making changes on the fly or if you think you won't be able to ""check in"" for a while.  That way they'll know for sure that you're ok and even follow along with your travels.  If, worst-case scenarios, something bad happens, you've left a trail.  Family and friends will know where you are and be able to mobilize help in the right location, perhaps even helping you return home early.

Something I just thought of is to also figure out with your family/friends as to where you can send things.  You'll likely come across a lot of souvenirs and I'm sure you don't want to carry them all with you the entire trip.  A couple of days is no problem, but since you're going for a couple of months it may be something you'd want to look into.

Get plug adapters.  Not only will you, most likely in Europe, come across AC power cycling that is different, the wall power outlets will be different.  Power cycling would be important for your electronics.

Invest in some language phrase books for locations that you plan on going to that don't predominantly speak English.  Another option would be a smart-phone application.  Analyze it, not only for its' phrase library, but also if it requires an internet connection.  There are some that are smaller, but is completely self-contained.  For my trip to Japan, I used the Japanese phrasebook from Lonely Planet.  Not only was it self-contained, it also had the phrases in written in Japanese kanji characters, romaji (the sounds of kanji spelled out in English alphabet), **AND** a short audio clip that says the phrase.  I highly recommend it.

For computer security, may I suggest using the Firefox addon HTTPS-Everywhere.  It's not an end-all-be-all security since not all sites support https and, if I remember correctly, automatically notify you of a suspect internet connection.

You're coming from the viewpoint that being a hegemonic military superpower wielding substantial public and private interests across the globe is an inherently bad thing.

You mean it's helped to line the pockets of those deeply entrenched within the military-industrial complex. You're mentioning only the seen effects of the military-industrial complex with the jobs ""created"" through defense spending whilst ignoring the opportunity cost of the money that had to be taken from the public or inflated away to pay for such a cost. Again, wars don't stimulate economies at all if the end-result is destruction.

&gt;Wars are also inevitable. Iran? North Korea? I think there's a better than break-even chance that we'll see active conflicts in those regions within our lifetimes. Mankind has yet to find a geopolitical issue a few bullets couldn't solve.

Wars are what people make of them. A conflict with Iran and North Korea certainly is inevitable if the US continues upon its foreign policy goals of maintaining its status as world superpower, whilst bankrupting us in the meantime. Sure, I'm sure there are many ways the military-industrial complex can fabricate ways to ""justify"" future conflicts with Iran and North Korea; after all, those individuals and politicians who profit from it would love nothing more.

&gt;Eh. We could default tomorrow and the world would keep spinning. The U.S. ain't perfect, but we're still the best game in town. China has its own economic issues to deal with and has been perfectly content in sullying its global interests with a disregard for intellectual property and human rights. The EU? They can start preaching about fiscal conservatism when they clean up the mess with Greece, Portugal and Ireland. They can only hang on to Germany's coattails for so long.

If defaulting from the national debt was such a trifle, then we'd have done it already. The point is that we don't know the direct and long-term effects of giving up on our obligations. What is obvious is that the United States Dollar will no longer have much faith or backing in the world as a reserve currency, not to mention the foreign resentment and militancy from such a default. If many countries, especially China, stake much of their long-term economic goals from the payments upon the national debt, then I can see relations quickly sour and trade protectionism take center-stage, increasing the propensity for open conflict between the two nations.

So, no, the world won't ""keep on spinning"" if the US reneges on its national debt. 

The EU, though, I'm in complete agreement. There's only so much the leeches can latch onto Germany and the UK before they get tired of the bullshit.

&gt;Frankly, most Arabs and the vast majority of Middle Easterners I've met care about the same shit we all do - a good job and a loving family. Its kind of naive to think that geopolitics is such a predominant topic of conversation with regular folks.

Most Arabs of course won't consider militant Islam as the solution to their woes, but the fact that there always seem to be an ""enemy"" in the ranks of terrorist organizations speaks to the effectiveness of these terrorist organizations and cells to acquire manpower and young recruits. The Israeli-Palestinean conflict is an example of a much larger problem when the younger generation views much of the Western interventionist foreign policy upon the Middle East as literally a struggle of life and death.

- Fast forward about 70 years.  America has a wildly unpopular President who assumed office in controversial fashion.  The economy is tanking as the dotcom bust is beginning.  It's not out of the realm of possibility that the government was behind the attacks (or knew about them beforehand and deliberately chose to do nothing, which amounts to almost the same thing) so they could use it as an excuse to demonize Muslims, gain emergency powers (PATRIOT ACT, Homeland Security Bill, etc.) and use it to invade Afghanistan and Iraq.

I guess some ten thousand will move to Germany over the next decade, maybe 0.1% or 0.2% of the total population, probably making it statistically negligible given that more will return from other European nations in turn.

However, I did not want to say that a vast amount of people from Poland will now pack their bags and move to Germany because the latter got the second-best sausages and beers. ;) Some people want to emigrate for a number of reasons no nationalist could ever understand, and not everyone of them would want to move to the Anglosphere. If you are already able to at least rudimentarily speak the local language, it's quite less of a struggle. Now finally a subset of them will not be obstructed by a stupid (and maybe even racist) special agreement signed eight years ago.

&gt; German proficiency may be much higher in Silesia, though.

I guess it's relatively high in the regions along the borders. My personal experience is limited to the Voivodship of Lubusz, though.

&gt; A fringe party doesn't get 7.3% of votes.

If you want to post their highest turnout in recent decades for whatever argumentative reasons, use [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxony_state_election,_2004#Results). Luckily they never got that much ever again so far, and the party is on the brink of financial collapse. The political landscape was different back then too, but I won't try to justify giving your vote to Nazi scum since that would be futile to begin with. And even if they got 15% of the vote, they'd still be on the fringe as long as everyone else would continue to not consider them worthy of cooperation, except for the stupid and desperate (then again, fuck them). For that matter, I see your poster and raise you [this](http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article4573010/Gericht-untersagt-Anti-Polen-Plakate-der-NPD.html) (stating that the posters had to be taken down on charges of [sedition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksverhetzung)).

I think my addition to this conversation is this, how LOCAL the support is.  Most MLS teams have rather diverse support from nearby regions, and almost all are located outside the downtown area of their markets, making them largely a driving destination.  

Seattle is very concentrated, and the support and more importantly actual attendance has come overwhelmingly from the city itself, not just the suburbs.  The Seahawks and Mariners are largely suburb-supported teams (at least in attendance).  

I think this is because of the pub culture that already existed in the neighborhood, but also from our intentions of being as non-typical, dare I say non-American in our sport culture.  (I think much of this was born out of the ECS.)  We really idealize the European football culture, and it's become its own odd counter-culture movement in Seattle.  This gives it tons of youth and downtown support from the core of Seattle.  The added bonus is that the suburbs and families are on board too.  It's ""cool"" to support the Sounders, but the suburban families keep coming despite our zeal...the culture clash is another topic for discussion altogether, but it seems to be peaceful disagreement that doesn't hurt attendance so far.  The day the front office tells the ECS to stop being themselves is the day the club starts to die, and I think they know that.

Living next door the stadium, it made me feel proud that the Sounders fans didn't trash my neighborhood like the Seahawks tailgaters (PILES OF TRASH LEFT IN THE STREETS...WTF?!) but also that it was a Seattle thing, not a regional thing, and that we were keeping alive my local establishments with patronage in our worst economic times in recent history.  We were something special, not just in support, but in our legacy and phenomenon.

The ECS were a huge factor for me as well, because when you're in the midst of their furor during a home match, it's a truly magical experience.  I hate the monotony of most sports viewing, and the culture of American sports in general.

Basically, the Sounders seem to have found a home for everyone, even the sporting disenfranchised like me.

&gt; Liquid showed interest, but EG chose not to accommodate us.

&gt; Ah, perspective!

Colbi:

&gt; Despite every European team agreeing to the ruleset without any concern, Team Liquid requested we make a rule that forced teams to alternate between servers from game to game for NA/EU and NA/KR matches. Since no European team issued this concern other than Team Liquid, we did not feel it appropriate to impose the rule on everyone which would just further complicate scheduling and broadcasting. Additionally, it should be noted that our ruleset did and does allow teams to play on either BattleNet region if both teams agree upon it.

LiquidTyler:

&gt; Every competition has some tension between accommodating players and minimizing the difficulty of running the tournament. Running good competitions is time consuming and difficult and frustrating so it is absolutely necessary to set limits on accommodating players.

&gt; One big issue is the server that games are being played on. TL.net, via the TSL, has publicized the best known solution for handling server issues with fairness to the players: For NA vs NA, play on NA, for EU vs EU, play on EU, for KR vs KR, play on KR. For NA vs EU, and NA vs KR, switch between servers for games. For KR vs EU, play all games on NA. Despite leading by example, TL has failed to popularize this solution, as it's apparently too difficult for any other online competition to implement.

&gt; Well at some point, players have to draw the line. But it's hard to do. The options for the players are playing in a $10k league with unfair conditions or not playing at all. There is not another $10k league that provides fairer conditions and is incompatible with EG's league. So you can conclude very little from European teams' willingness to participate. But I think you might get a little bit of insight into how EG operates: is it good enough for us to pull it off? Yep, ok, all done! It's like the guy in school who is aiming to pass rather than get top marks. It's not failing, but it is what it is.

&gt; If any guys in charge are reading this now: I'm pretty damn sure you didn't intend to run a $10k team league that Liquid would choose to not participate in. But post your threads and gather your views on teamliquid.net anyway, all while falling pitifully below the standard that teamliquid.net itself sets for running online competitions. I hope the viewers can recognize the difference. I hope more players can find themselves in a position to demand the highest standards rather than saying yes to everything that meets their lowest standards.

InControl:

&gt; TSL had a huge population of korean invites (so it makes sense to accommodate koreans/KR server)

&gt; EG MC has 1 team with people on the kOR server and even then it isn't their whole team. Excluding Sen EVERY OTHER PLAYER is from NA/EU which has 10x better connection than korea.

&gt; Why would the majority (VAST MAJORITY) take a hit to the benefit of TL and it's few players in korea?

&gt; A NA team hosts a tourney on the NA server where it's casters/teams are mostly located and TL asks for an unreasonable exception and then slanders EG... not your finest moment Tyler.

The Netherlands, as flat as a pancake, are using this method.

Dutch off-peak hour energy is used to pump water up to the mountain lakes of Norway. Spikes in energy consumption are compensated the other way around. This makes it possible to run the Dutch Gas/Coal plants at maximum efficiency all the time.

They're all adapted from the system of the Prussian Empire, which was developed with the literal goal of producing graduates who if conscripted would sooner obey the order for a suicidal bayonet charge than quit the field when they knew their officers weren't looking. States have an incredible incentive to impair the ability and desire of people to determine their own rational self interest, precisely because they understand the fact that: 
&gt;Simply because both parties see the exchange as beneficial, does not mean they actually are beneficial to both parties.

The degree to which they can prevent the intellectual maturation of the people in their borders is the degree to which they can get people to become invested in the endlessly futile ""political process,"" consent almost unanimously to taxation, surrender more and more freedom and resources for the health of the state and her cronies; and stir them up for--and even get them to volunteer to die in--wars she profiteers from. Really, there is no involvement with the state that is beneficial for anyone in the end, and everything a modern state does under the ostensible ""consent of the governed,"" not only thrives under--but requires--the creation and exploitation of developmental deficiencies in the minds of her populace.

I don't agree that we should point at the corporations taking the sloppy seconds on this dynamic to sell people unneeded crap and say ""that's the *real* problem!"", nor do I agree that the willingness of people who have been systematically infantilized to buy unneeded crap for childish emotional reasons is evidence of ""human psychology"" being poorly served by a free market.

First, you need to understand that broadband is an industry thats generally referred to as a natural monopoly because it has extremely high fixed costs. The next thing to consider is that the way people use broadband today and the way people used it even 5-10 years ago is constantly changing. Traditional data models were based on completely different expectations for data use then we have today. The next thing that you really need to consider when looking at broadband today is the concept of Universal Service. Universal Service is basically the notion that broadband access should be available to everyone, regardless of their location. Sounds simple enough right? Not really, see it's incredibly more expensive to provide broadband to rural areas as opposed to urban ones. The question becomes who fronts the cost for this? Currently the government fronts a big piece of the bill. But the telecommunications industry is constantly evolving. The use of wireline telephone service, satellite, and eventually even cable will likely completely disappear. The question becomes how should companies respond to these changes, should they shift the costs by charging ""power users"" more then the average customer or should the subsidies come from another area? Anyone who has really researched the issue might argue with some of the points i've raised here but the bottom line is the issue is more complex then simply money or greed. While I agree there is a great deal of that going on, if you take a look at other countries besides the US you'll see similar problems. The reason its becoming even more expensive and bothersome for those of us from Canada and the US is that our countries have a much lower population density then places like Europe or Korea.

Maybe it's because the Europeans weren't involved in the Pacific theater?  

Personally, I think that the older epic wars you mentioned are not viewed as interesting as WW2 for a few reasons: the older the war is, the less we know about it.  As an American, I know *very little* about the Napoleanic Wars.  I don't know what they were about.  WW1 was inherently very confusing.  It was, mostly, waged because of a bunch of treaties everyone had with each other.  There was no definite good or bad guy.  And although both sides did war crimes, the German side was unambiguously wrong.  Invading countries for no real reason, and genociding innocent people.  Which, yeah, happened in WW1, but still.

The Holocaust is responsible for the state of Israel, and there's a lot of cultural iconography there.

Not because it was or wasn't a long time ago, but because sweeping through an entire region of the world and slaughtering an entire group of people is wrong.

But why do we drag it up? Because if you don't learn from histories mistakes, you will be fucked by it - hard. Do you seriously want to dismiss the holocaust of European Jews just because it was something from the last century, really? Oh, but those people were gassed a long time ago, better consider it in the context of that culture. Fuck that. You want to know why people bring these things up?

&gt; I try to respect ppls' beliefs and I would never try to take someone's faith away from them

Beliefs do not deserve respect. Something is either true or it is not. If someone cannot clearly demonstrate why something is true, then there is a pretty good chance that they are wrong. If someone believes in little green space men sending them subliminal messages through their hairdryer then I don't need to respect their belief. I will call them a nut case, because that is what they are. Yet for some reason if we replace the little green space men with a dead jewish guy from the bronze age, and we replace the hairdryer with prayer, then suddenly their belief deserves respect? Nope. I'll still think they are a loon. If they try to excuse their belief as ""just something I was brought up with"" then they are fucking weak. They haven't asked the right questions, they haven't challenged easily refutable claims, and they are dishonest with themselves. I don't respect intellectual cowards for not challenging the stories of desert nomads. Want to take away a Christian's faith? Motivate them to read their bible from cover to cover. Nothing will make a stronger atheist than a careful reading of scripture. The bible celebrates slavery, abuse and oppression of women, and the genocide of rival nations. It is more depraved than the foulest pornography, and more violent than the bloodiest hollywood film. It is a book filled with pointless killing, and foolish superstition. Fuck their god, their books, and their beliefs. There is no room for it in modern civilization.

But what about the moderates?

A moderate christian exists only by ignorance of their own religion. Fundamentalists are only a problem for modern civilization because the fundamentals of christianity are completely absurd. Same thing for Islam - a billion moderates, and a few extremists that read and understood their holy books.

&gt;  I know a lot of bad things have been done in the name of various faiths, but I think that bad and mad ppl will be bad and mad, no matter what faith they have or don't have and any religious community is too diverse to make any sweeping statements.

&gt; slower wage growth

With all due respect I get the impression you know what you're talking about. I did have a degree in PPE, I spent 4 years studying Politics and Economics. I wrote many an essay on the reducing economic disparity. I wrote a paper on the rise of the left in Europe on the 90s, The UK Labour party between 1997 - 2005 reduced wage disparity by introducing a minimum wage (among other things) this in turn decreased poverty, lifting 500,000 young people out of poverty which in turn reduced crime, the economy also boomed during this time too.

The UK economy stalled in the late 2000s because Gordon Brown deregulated the banks, [he himself has admitted that he should have kept the markets more regulated](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/apr/13/gordon-brown-banking-sector-regulation)* as the Germans, who weathered the financial storm far better than any other European country did. 

There are no examples of a reduction of wealth disparity slowing wage growth.

The machine gun (which was over 50 by then) and artillery actually came of age with their roll in combat becoming forefront. Tanks were first used in battle, as were the first modern battleships. It was the advent of modern chemical warfare.

World War One was the mechanization of war. That is why it is interesting. New steam turbines powered battleships, tanks and tractors replaced horses, mud filled trenches replaced infantry lines, artillery fired for days on end pummelling fields into moonscape, all while airships bombed the cities of Europe. The industrial revolution allowed for the rapid production of large amounts of goods in a short amount of time. From bombs, to rifles, to tanks, to warships, all could be built in bulk. And if you lost those in battle, you could build some more. Add this to trench warfare and you get what amounts to hell on earth, as at some point it was forgotten that people aren't as replaceable as those goods.

I don't think we don't learn about WW1 cause its boring. WW2 has stories and tales, some of courage and others of loss. They make epic movies and great settings for games. This makes for an interesting and captivating read in book, and good watch on TV. WW1 doesn't have as many stories of courage or heroic deeds to capture the imagination.

        No, no plans. The site was free for several years and will remain so for the foreseable future.
        Our philosophy is different to sites like rapidshare.com who do everything to annoy the user to pay up, we think providing a more compelling service with more features is a better choice and helps maintain the goodwill with our users.
    What are the upload file size limits?
        Guest User ~ 1000MB ! per file
        Free Registered User ~ 1000MB ! per file
        If uploading more than one file, the limit is per file, not the total
        These limits are subject to change, we used to have higher limits but it seems uploading / downloading very large files over HTTP is an unreliable process and its hard to make any guarantees above 100MB
        Premium accounts will probably have a higher upload file size, but not yet available
    How many files can I upload?
        As many files as you like :)
    Are there any download limits?
        Our bandwidth is shared between all users, so at peak times it might get slow, beside our best effort guarantee we can not promise anything to guest and free users
        Do note that speeds are fastest off-peak, between 24:00 and 12:00 GMT when there are alot of unused and wasted bandwidth.
        Free registered accounts get faster downloads than Guest users
        Download accelerators such as FlashGet are allowed
        Please don't open more than 2 parallel connections per download
        Each Download Ticket expires after 24 hours
        Our servers are in USA and EU so the people in those countries should get the faster speeds in theory.
        There are no download counters! and you can download all you want! Same as you could with mihd.net since 2006, though there is a CAPTCHA to stop automated requests if multiple downloads occur from the same location in short time.
    Can i resume downloads?
        Yes! even for free users :)
    I got an error message during upload/download what should i do?
        See contact link down bottom of each page, send us a quick email, be happy to help you out.
    Do i have to install anything to download?
        No you don't have to install anything, any toolbars or spyware like other sites do ;) just make sure you have a recent enough browser to make the most of this site.
    What is the relation between ifile.it and mihd.net?
        iFile.it is the replacement for mihd.net, checkout blog for more details
    How long are my files kept?
        Guest users, 10 days after last download
        Free registered users:

            25 days after last download for files above 500MB
        Note the above limits are not strictly enforced and in reality sometimes takes longer if there's no need and plenty of storage available at times.
        Also the above are set so to encourage people to avail of free accounts, and to upload smaller more manageable files.

Greeks had distinct words for sexual/erotic love (eros). It also gives petrophiles a bad name just for liking rocks.

Another annoying phony-intellectual word I despise is ""anti-semite,"" which was coined by a German (who hated Jews, if IIRC), using it to exclusively mean 'against the Jews,' but using the biblical character Shem for its basis, who was supposedly the son that survived Noah's Ark during the flood in order to procreate the east race of Middle Eastern-Near Asians (which Jews are a part of), as distinct from the white brother Japheth and the black brother Ham, who supposedly populated Japhetic Caucasia and Europe and Hametic Africa (respectively). And most ironically, this silly word is now used primarily to distinguish between Middle Eastern Jews and their Arab neighbors who hate them, when really, they are all supposedly defendants of Shem and therefore all Semites, and therefore all pretty much incapable of being anti-Semitic.

No.

The majority of the Jews who made up the state of Israel immigrated after the loss of the Ottoman Empire, from Europe and Russia, as well as other nearby Arab and Iranian territories. The indigenous Palestinian Jews were always vastly outnumbered by either christians or muslims since the rule of Byzantium (more than 1500+ years ago).

&gt;The UN proposed a partition plan that gave the Jews very little in 1948. The Jews accepted and the Arabs rejected this plan.

The Jewish population was offered 55% of the land despite being only 30% of the population. Not to mention half of the state of Israel would've consisted of Arabs who never chose to reside in a foreign state imposed on them by the west.

A lot of the most intense, high level, matches involve Koreans. Dreamhack wouldn't have been the same without that Thozain vs MC set. To eliminate the potential for more quality games like those is a huge mistake IMO.

Team Liquid withholding participation in an attempt to open up EG's Master's Cup to these players is an honorable thing. They're giving up a lot of potential money in order to raise the standards of SC2 tournaments and I think they should get a lot of respect/support for that.

If EG is not willing to open up their tournaments then they will never be looked at with the same level of regard as TSL/NASL/MLG/GSL.",0,False,1427111716,t3_h1vrf,t5_2qpp6,True,starcraft,0,t1_c1s0eak,

I hate some of their actions and how they handled certain situations, or even some of the staff that they have employed, but I certainly don't hate the club.  I live in Manchester and quite often go drinking with many long term season ticket holders, the home and awayers.  My father in law has been to every United home and away game, including European aways and friendlies, for about 30 years.  Hating United is like hating your brother.  You don't really HATE them, you just get annoyed with them at times, but there is a basic level of respect between you both.  I respect United as a club.  Hell, I respect many United fans just as I respect any other fan who spends as much of their hard earned on following their team as I do.  We have the same passion, with different outlets.  Pete Boyle for example, is a wumming bitter bastard who never has a nice word to say about City or its fans.  However, you can't fault his commitment to his club, so there's a begrudging respect there.

FCUM I don't respect.  Their heritage is one of petulance and disloyalty.  I get pissed by disloyalty in football fans anyway (because it is essentially a tribal thing).  If people cannot understand why other hardcore fans will look down on people for abandoning their club, then I can't really help.  I can't explain it.  I suppose it's because they immediately become hypocrites, I don't know.

FCUM's stadium is funded massively by public money.  Their financial position is as such because they are followed by the ex-MUFC people, including a large proportion of fans banned for hooliganism.  I can name names if you like but I'm pretty sure that you would already know the type I'm talking about.  

If FCUM summed themselves up as a single club, I'd have less of a problem with them.  They don't, their fans cross brand with United ALL THE TIME.  Look at the previous post: Two clubs, One Soul.  It's ridiculous, it exists purely as a jolly for ex-United fans. 

I completely disagree with the notion that fan based clubs are a good thing.  They are the worse thing possible in the entire world.  Real Madrid and Barca (over the past 100 years rather than 2 weeks) are what happens when fans own your clubs.  It becomes a popularity contest, and even the Germans are starting to think twice about the level of fan involvement.  Fans aren't businessmen.  They are, by their nature, determined to make the club succeed and if that means by picking up ex-big name players on massive wages, they will.  If Giggs came available tomorrow and expressed an interest, but trebled the FCUM wage bill, how would most supporters vote?  That's the problem.

Besides, you can talk about ownership and the rest of it, but it essentially is a mute point.  A club IS it's fans and vice versa, not its balance sheet.  However, I do encourage as many football clubs as possible to invest in their local community, but it seems a daft thing to say to FCUM when you are moving communities already.

&gt;Looking at your previous posts you do just seem like a troll who wants to wind up other teams (mainly MUFC), a lot of your posts seem to talk about MUFC more than your own team. Stop being a bitter blue and worry about your own club.

 on wikipedia ffs: ""Many broadband Internet Service Providers in North America and Europe introduced bandwidth caps in the early 21st century. The same practice has been in place in Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and South Africa since the release of broadband.""

Many countries that don't have caps had heavy government investment into infrastructure (Eg Sweden , Korea, Japan). 

Usage habits differ considerably by country and this also influences pricing and supply.

The american situation is almost identical to the situation in Australia. The wholesale /spectrum sharing agreements are similar as is the ex government now privatised monopoly (in fact its more duopoly in the states - gone full circle after the baby bell antitrust breakup).  Its just we always had caps -  we also have to pay for international traffic - the first few unlimited plans went away as ISP's realised it was a bad idea (chello in NZ for example)- and as our infrastructure was upgraded the caps went up steadily. They have some unlimited plans here but only from isps with own infrastructure doing spectrum sharing -or buying the same from a wholesaler other than Telstra -  and its all relatively new and will be interesting to see how long they last given that they have never been very successful at turning a profit. Unlimited is a pipe dream - everyone ends up subsiding the leeches and demand is outstripping infrastructure and has done for a long time. Because its just not profitable enough for private enterprise to do it in the end and demand is increasing faster than newer faster networks are being rolled out. Hence NBN in australia. Only way we will get Japan style broadband here - like it or not.

Redditors can bitch all you want about greedy isp's - its not going to change the reality.  It just took a while to happen in the states. And you can blame the leeches mostly.

Actually they not

After Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007, Israel announced the freezing of the Crossings Agreement. **The Palestinian force that operated the crossing on behalf of the Palestinian Authority was unable to reach the crossing due to Hamas' control of the Gaza Strip**. Israel objected to opening the crossing on the grounds that it was unable to monitor the persons passing through it, and **Egypt closed the border since it was impossible to implement the Crossing Agreement**. **The European force also stopped its monitoring activities due to the European Union's refusal to cooperate with Hamas**. As a result, since June 2007, the crossing has not been opened in accordance with the Crossings Agreement. **Egypt, which can open the crossing on its side, generally refrains from doing so**, thereby becoming a partner in Israel's siege policy.

Yeah, they are amazingly brave. Read the Wiki article on Gao Zhisheng

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gao_Zhisheng#Detentions

&gt; Detentions
&gt;
&gt; Amnesty International alleged on 17 January 2006 that Gao narrowly escaped an assassination attempt, planned as a traffic accident ordered by Chinese secret police.[6] On 4 February 2006, Gao, together with Hu Jia and other activists, launched a “Relay Hunger Strike for Human Rights,” whereby different activists and citizens fasted for 24 hours in rotation. The hunger strike was joined by people in 29 provinces, as well as overseas, though several participants were arrested for joining.[10]
&gt;
&gt; On 15 August 2006, after numerous death threats and continued harassment, Gao disappeared while visiting his sister's family. On 21 September 2006, he was officially arrested.[11] On 22 December 2006, Gao was convicted of ""subversion"", and was sentenced to three years in prison, suspended, and placed on probation for five years. The sentence also deprives him of his political rights – the freedom to publish or speak out against the government – for one year. He had publicly confessed to a number of errors. On his liberation, Gao recanted his confession and described torture he said he experienced[7][12] during his 54 days[13] in custody. He also said captors threatened he would be killed if he spoke publicly about the matter.[7] In chapter 6 of his memoirs written in 2006, Gao criticised the CCP for employing ""the most savage, most immoral, and most illegal means to torture our mothers, torture our wives, torture our children, and torture our brothers and sisters…"". He formally renounced his membership of ""this inhumane, unjust, and evil Party"", declaring it ""the proudest day of my life.[14]
&gt;
&gt; The American Board of Trial Advocates selected Gao to receive the prestigious Courageous Advocacy Award; they had invited him to receive the award personally in Santa Barbara, California on 30 June 2007.[15]
&gt;
&gt; In the fall of 2007, Gao’s memoir A China More Just was published in English in the United States.[16]
&gt;
&gt; On 22 September 2007, after writing open letters to Vice-President of the European Parliament, Edward McMillan-Scott, and then to US Congress calling for a boycott of the Olympics,[17] Gao was once again taken away from his home, where he had been under house arrest, by Chinese secret police.[18] A letter from Gao claimed that he endured ten days of torture that involved beatings, electric prods and even toothpicks to his naked body, followed by weeks of emotional torture. Gao wrote that his torturers said his case had become personal with 'uncles' in the state security apparatus after he had repeatedly publicised previous mistreatment.[19]
&gt;
&gt;Disappearances
&gt;
&gt; In February 2009, Gao was taken away for interrogation by Chinese security agents[1] and had not been seen until[13] he resurfaced in Shanxi in March 2010. One month prior to his disappearance, Gao's wife and two children escaped China with the help of underground religious adherents. They arrived in the United States and were granted right of asylum ten days later.[7][8] During his disappearance, in response to queries from his family about his whereabouts, police claimed he lost his way and went missing in September 2009.[20][21] For several months, Gao was not charged, and the Government never acknowledged his whereabouts, nor their involvement in his disappearance. His last contact with friends or family was one phone call placed to his brother in July 2009.[19]
&gt;
&gt; In January 2010, Gao's brother, Gao Zhiyi, told an interviewer that the Beijing police told him that Gao ""lost his way and went missing"" on 25 September 2009,[22][23] igniting fears that Gao was no longer alive.[24][25] On 21 January 2010, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a cryptic statement that Gao was “where he should be,” [26][27] and said he did not know Gao's whereabouts at a later press conference.[7] During the visit to China by David Miliband in March, the Chinese foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, said that Gao had been sentenced on subversion charges, but denied he had been tortured.
&gt;
&gt; On 28 March 2010 Gao was found to be living near Wutai Mountain. Addressing a reporter by telephone, he said he was not in a position to be interviewed, but confirmed he had been sentenced and freed.[28] A few days later, he met the media, appearing thinner and more subdued than in the past and said that he had abandoned his criticism of the government in the hope of reuniting with his wife and two children, who secretly fled China early last year.[29]
&gt;
&gt; In April, 2010 Gao's family reported they have not heard from him since he returned from a visit to Xinjiang 10 days previously.[30] The South China Morning Post reports that Gao left Beijing to visit his in-laws in Urumqi, carrying just a backpack between 9 and 12 April. Gao's father-in-law said Gao arrived at his house in the company of four police officers, spent just one night there before once again being taken away by police. His father-in-law called a friend of his in Beijing on 21 April to say Gao was to board a plane at 4.30 p.m. His father-in-law said Gao had promised to call after returning home, but there was no word.[31] Emily Lau and Albert Ho said Gao's disappearance ""prov[ed] that justice and the rule of law is disappearing in communist China – if it ever existed at all"".[32]
&gt;
&gt; The report of Gao's 2010 disappearance and detention was considered by the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention which, in March, 2011, called for his release.[33]

So basically anyone that stands up for people's rights under the Chinese constitution can expect to be arbitrarily detained, tortured and eventually disappeared if they don't stop. 

But the amazing thing is that despite all that people like Li Fangping still do it. In fact there's a movement called the Weiquan movement which is essentially dedicated to defending people's rights under the Chinese constitution.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weiquan_movement

It's a curious situation really - on paper what they are doing is legal. In practice the secret police try to intimidate them into stopping and if all else fails disappears them.

Now imagine what it would mean for Taliban to know about the 9/11 before they happened. It will mean that they will have to inform their central council about the conspiracy. Why should Bin Laden take the risk of leaks if he can do without telling them about it? It is most likely that the Taliban were never in the know about the 9/11. 

Once the attacks happened, you can bet that they took him in custody, surprised as anyone. Again, when they said that they will hand him over only to an Islamic country, they were again going by their book, literally. The point is that it could have been arranged - just as was dne with the Lockerbie bomber and Swiss Law in European soil.

For example, salad dressing selection is a less ideal here I think.

**Roasted almonds** in its various flavors (hickory, soya sauce)

(These are more ""cheat"" items, I'd love it if somebody can give me some feedback on these)

[**Scandanavian Crisp Bread**](http://www.hollandandbarrett.com/pages/product_detail.asp?pid=281) - Such a lifesaver. Really hope these are considered keto-friendly by the purists.

**Pate** - Never developed a taste for it until I can to Europe, now I ca't get enough of it, goes well with the crisp bread.

**Fruit squash** - Concentrated juice mix that comes in lots of almost-sugar-free varieties

**Greek yogurt + dried coconut** — Because sometimes you get bored of cottage cheese.

**Tyrell's mixed root vegetable crisps** — Eat very conservatively, but nothing beats 'em as they can cure the craving for potatoes, the most evil of the carb foods. I also occasionally roast my own parsnips... anyone know if yams/sweet potatoes are any better?

**Pork Rinds/Scratching** - I like the puffy kind over the fatty kind by far... tastes great with hot sauce

**Korean Kimchi** - There's a whole world of tasty spicy fermented veggies waiting for you here!

**Seaweed snacks** - Can get these in any Asian store in lots of flavours as well.

It informed the European monitors that the crossing was closed for security reasons, and ceased to carry out its part of the agreement. Israel allowed the crossing to be opened only in isolated cases, and without giving advance notice. From then until June 2007, the crossing was closed for 265 days.

After Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007, Israel announced the freezing of the Crossings Agreement. The Palestinian force that operated the crossing on behalf of the Palestinian Authority was unable to reach the crossing due to Hamas' control of the Gaza Strip. Israel objected to opening the crossing on the grounds that it was unable to monitor the persons passing through it, and Egypt closed the border since it was impossible to implement the Crossing Agreement. The European force also stopped its monitoring activities due to the European Union's refusal to cooperate with Hamas. As a result, since June 2007, the crossing has not been opened in accordance with the Crossings Agreement. Egypt, which can open the crossing on its side, generally refrains from doing so, thereby becoming a partner in Israel's siege policy.""

What? South Africa is a country. And he/she has a point. There's a pervasive perception among many foreigners (Americans, basically) that South Africa is a flyblown mudpit where everybody lives in huts and has ostrich-powered electricity.

While many South Africans do live in poverty-stricken shantytowns, there are many dense urban areas indistinguishable from those in first world countries.

That said, however, there IS a lot of crime. Like most suburban South Africans, **I live behind a 7ft wall, topped with razor spikes, with a perimeter alarm and 24-hour rapid response security.**

Which was made into a PBS documentary: [The Prize](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278873/).

IIRC, the British found the oil in the Middle East.  But, as their international influence wained post WWII, and the Soviet Union's grew, the U.S. took up the reigns of the British in the Middle East.  So, essentially, the US inherited the Middle East from the British.

The British got the Middle East so that they could build the Suez Canal, among other things.  They had an empire to run, and most of the money was in India and China, and the Middle East is along the way to both of those places.

Trivia: Israel was formed in what was, at the time, known as ""British Palestine.""

The US pioneered the Oil economy.  The world's first big oil fields were in western Pennsylvania.  Then there were the big fields in Texas, and later Mexico and Venezuela.

Which was all well and good for the U.S., but the folks in Europe realized that they were in trouble as the Oil economy was pushing the US well ahead of everyone else.  So, the British went and found oil in the Middle East.  The Dutch found oil in the ""East Indies"", known to you as Indonesia (EDIT: and to me as the Philippines).  The French built nuclear power plants out the wazoo, and, once the US had fucked up in (and generally fucked up) Iran, made friendly with the Iranians.

The Soviets made friendly with the Egyptians (who do you think built the dams on the Nile, which, BTW, have completely fucked the Nile river valley's ecology, and therefore Egypt economy), and pretty much anyone who would give them the time of day.

So, the Israeli's leverage the Soviet influence and a general ""sorry about the genocide"" attitude into massive financial aid from the US, which pisses off everyone else in the Middle East, since the Israelis are, in effect, an invader.  Besides, what better way to distract your peeples from your atrocities than you screech about the evil Israelis?  (You can tell when shit is going down in Tehran, because that's when Ahmadinejad will show up in the international press talking about vaporizing Israel.)

But, after forty or fifty years, the peeples start asking why you haven't defeated the Israelis in glorious battle, so you point the finger at the US and its support of Israel.

Meanwhile, over in Saudi Arabia, dissidents are also pointing out how chummy the royal family is with the US.  (The Saudi Arabian royal family really is quite fond of the US, for obviou$ rea$on$.)  So, the US is The Bad Guys.  (In some ways, the US really is the bad guys, but not in the way most terrorist think.)

So, when you get tired of talking young people into blowing themselves up in Israel, you talk some of them into flying planes into buildings in the US.

Shit goes down in the US, and you know somebody is going to get bombed.  So, Afghanistan gets bombed, because Osama, a Saudi Arabian, who talked a bunch of Saudi Arabians into attacking the US, is hiding there, and the US can't very well bomb Saudi Arabia, now can it?  That goes over so well, the Taliban in general get vilified, and US troops are suddenly ""liberating"" Afghanistan from the Afghanistanis.

(Take a break to go read ""[Flashman](http://books.google.com/books?id=uyUyfgelXVEC&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=flashman&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)"" by George MacDonald Fraser.  Hilarious satire, it also gives a nice description of the British defeat in Afghanistan.  What?  The British?  Yep.  The British, the Soviets, now the US.... Afghanistan is sometimes called ""Where Empires go to die."")

How Iraq got thrown into the mess is still a little cloudy.  It will be interesting to see what history decides.  It might have just been part of Darth Chaney's retirement plan.  More likely it was the start of a larger strategy to encircle, then strangle Iran.  Check out this map of the [Middle East](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/maps/refmap_middle_east.html).  What borders Iran to the east?  What borders it to the west?  Do the math.

"".

Also, keep in mind that it's not just about the oil *reserves*.  It's also about all the oil that's already been sucked out of the ground, because that all turned into big piles of cash.

If someone from Africa drew a stick figure it'd be an African male from their region, ect ect.

I didn't spend long in South Africa at all and I didn't spend a lot of time in the slums either, but they're not all over the place. It's a dangerous place, full of poverty but it's really not the whites keeping the blacks down (or the Indians, or the ""coloureds"" - and yes, that's the term that is used over there for mixed race people, who are absolutely lovely and beautiful btw). The cities are impressive and very European, the shanty towns are what they are unfortunately.


 There's a shitload of poverty and fear though. I didn't experience much racism over there, the closest it got to was an elderly black man shouting ""hey whitey, suck on me"" (I was eating an ice-lolly) while I was sort of fainting from sunstroke. That was a little scary. I also didn't see a single white person working either... Which some people think is somehow fair, that the white population are now being denied jobs because they're white. Racism can be both ways, and taking things away from people just because they had them for so long does NOT even things out, it just makes everyone poorer. There are plenty of taxes set up depending on where you're living - if you're in a slum area, your electricity is practically free (if not free) and your cell phone network IS free. I thought this sounded completely fair and just - how can the poor be expected to pay for basic necessities like electricity? BUT if you're in a white area, your taxes go up - by a *lot*. There was one (white) man I was talking to who was very worried because he had 2 young children and suddenly his water taxes and electricity were going up so much he didn't think he'd be able to pay it. They had gone up by 30% the year before and that year (2009) they were going up another 60%. Remember that wages are low over there for *everyone.* So if you're earning one euro (10 rand) or even less an hour, these costs are huge. The cost of living isn't low either. Food is incredibly cheap compared to Irish prices, but clothing was the same if not similar. Another girl I was talking to was earning 16 euro cent an hour to work in a Video Rental store, yet the clothes were around €40 for a top (I couldn't ever afford that as a tourist). It isn't helping, it's just dragging everyone down - instead of figuring out a better system this is what happens. 

But you know, for the most part, there didn't seem to be any hatred in day to day life at all. Everyone worked on and got along fine and 99% of everyone I met was really nice - bar one VERY racist white guy (sickening) and one racist black guy.


Make of it what you will. I'm not racist at all, and it is completely fair to say that **cultures** can clash horribly and can cause a lot of problems for everyone involved. I went to South Africa expecting the worst and everything went better than expected.

Do you understand that California *alone* is more than 50% larger than Britain? It has a higher population, too. And it's one of Fifty states in the US. People are spread out, don't presume to know how it is we live. And yes, not everyone in Europe lives in terraced housing or apartments, but you have an infrastructure that allows for people to hop on a train and get to those cities. The US has roads, period.

The bigger these things get the more efficient they are.

They will cost more than gas, coal, oil and nuclear, but they are a safe bet in the short term as there is a clear path to better efficiency and lower costs (make them bigger, economies of scale) and they can be made in lots of small steps. In comparison the upfront costs of nuclear are massive. 

In the long term the price of gas, oil, and coal is uncertain with a fair chance of them increasing to a point that is uneconomical. If we wait until that point, IMHO, it will be too late to do much about it. 

If we are producing 30% wind/solar, 30% nuclear/hydro, 30% oil/gas/coal and 10% other (tidal, geothermal etc) if any one of them fail then at least we have options to ramp up other options. If we wait for a clear ""right"" answer to emerge then we run the chance of running out of time.

China makes a lot of sense and definitely taps into a vein of national unease. But it seems like games have been a little reluctant to touch that. Except the Fallout series, but then they laid that down (in text only) in the first game, before it was even very trendy, and it wouldn't have made any sense to change it after that. The recent FPS titles, for all their flaws, did an excellent job of staying true to the Fallout canon.

It (edit: democratic socialism) ~~also refers to~~ (edit: often times goes together with) [social capitalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capitalism). Germany practices this, Australia as well. Germany believes no company or entity should become too powerful and thus they try to create competition **which allows for free market forces to come into effect**. We use to do such a thing as well in the United States when we use to break up monopolies not too long ago. 

Germany is extraordinarily wealthy and strong at this time because they know that by having companies compete it creates more wealth and less inefficiencies as well as promotes innovation.

Example of cell phones.. which is a good example for the EU example of forcing companies to compete.. they know that mandating free incoming calls (so not to double charge both the one initiating and then one receiving) they also have it so companies have to have quad band phones and that works no most all major providers (also mandates GSM). You can swap sim cards if you don't like your current carrier without ditching your phone. Here there are built up barriers to prevent you from switching (2 year contract, different phone communication standards, many frequencies that are not shared). That might not be a 100% accurate picture (for instance I don't know of they necessarily share spectrum for sure) but that is well documented in how they force competition and put some small smart regulations on the market to force competition. 

But in the case of other countries and internet access. US pays huge amounts of money to companies to subsidize their roll out of broad band. Other countries either built it out directly themselves or do the same thing, pay to have it built out by companies. But THEN they force line sharing so ISP's compete on those lines. If the lines are owned by a company (and say that company is also providing services) they limit the amount that company can extort from those other ISP's as to not allow them to unfairly manipulate the competition to their advantage.

This also drives prices lower and instead of consumers spending money on products that , should free market forces really be in play, would be cheaper, they can spend it in other areas of the economy.",0,False,1427112206,t3_h1kem,t5_2qgzg,True,business,0,t1_c1s1fom,

&gt;Also, the people partying in the streets are odd. I might give New York a free pass but otherwise... it looks like the kind of blind nationalism that makes us Euros afraid of the US

Franco, Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, hundreds of years of imperial expansion &amp; blind nationalism. No offense but the entire reason we came to the United States was because we weren't nationalists. The entire reason we intervened in European affairs in the 1900s was because of nationalism. I'm not saying I disagree with you but I think it'd kind of a bullshit ethnocentric thing to say all things considered: 50 years ago Europe decided nationalism is bad, the United States having the disadvantage of not having 2000 years of political history has not followed suit quickly enough, thus: Europe is afraid of America? 

&gt;cheering like the citizens of Coruscant after the death of the Emperor when all you've done is kill a figurehead who has lost much of his symbolic (and probably a lot of real) power over the last years and whose demise may now incite more bloodshed.

The veracity of this observation will not be known for ten or twenty years. He was an *incredibly* influential leader and this death is *very* significant for American foreign policy. If you want to think less of Americans taking to the streets (I do) because of his death, that's fine, but lets not downplay the importance of it. Oh, and apparently being European has given you a license to ignore the common mans sense of closure. 2000 years of culture, a little light on the empathy.

&gt;Also, I know I'll sound like a tinfoil hat wearer but some details about the whole thing seem sketchy at best. He was guarded by only three people and they still shot him?

As an American I find a sense of irony that he was shot by a common American soldier and not given the benefits of a trial or hanging. Let him die nameless rather than a martyr. You think it's sketchy? There have been standing orders in this country to execute that man on sight for more than 10 years. Did you think we were joking?

&gt;Was it planned as an execution from the get-go? Wouldn't it be more symbolic to drag him in front of a court and shed some light on how terrorism works?

I can't speak for the government but I imagine they thought it would be more symbolic to show the world how the United States military works. The world can mock and laugh at Americans, they can call us uncultured and uncouth, but at the end of the day our soldiers are very highly trained and they don't fuck around. 

&gt;Also, I do believe this single event pretty much exonerated the Western military adventurism of the past decade. The monster is slain, the end has now justified the means. I dunno how this'll play out but I'd really hate to see Osama coming up as an example of how ""force"" and military action is a legitimate form of foreign policy in future debates.

I believe that the American contention that terrorism = military intervention is an axiom that pretty much everyone in the world understands. The world can debate whether or not it is legitimate but the discussion will not be heard in this country. I do not necessary support this line or think it is the most effective strategy, but it is law and little consideration is given to whether the world will exonerate us.

&gt;But yeah, I may be reading too much into it. Let's see where the pieces fall. Bottom line: good riddance to that asshole but I doubt the world will look different tomorrow.

It depends on your perspective. Personally I don't find this event to be all that significant but I think that culturally America has turned a corner and ""put 9/11 in the past."" I could be wrong but I think a lot of the celebration that you're seeing has more context than a simple execution. Many of the the difficulties that we have faced as a country over the last decade seem to be reaching the end--it is at least tacitly understood that once the wars end that our economy will recover and our quality of life will improve.

And if someone want to participate in the GSL, they have to move to South Korea. That's not very accommodating for international participants.

They probably would, but it's also fairly widely known that the latency from EU to US is more predictable and easier to deal with than KR to US or EU to KR.

&gt;**Central components of the “Welcome Back” program will include:**

&gt;**Each territory will be offering selected PlayStation entertainment content for free download. Specific details of this content will be announced in each region soon.**

&gt;**All existing PlayStation Network customers will be provided with 30 days free membership in the PlayStation Plus premium service. Current members of PlayStation Plus will receive 30 days free service.**

* Describe my 20's: When I graduated with my B.S., I felt really lost. I had been ""groomed"" (for lack of a better word) to go to graduate school. Finished top of my class (literally) at an extremely tough engineering school, completed 3 undergraduate research projects, 2 internships, etc. But I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life and whether grad school was really what I wanted. I had many ""who am i?!?!"" moments.

    So...I did what everyone told me **not** to do and took a couple of years off to work in industry. I am so glad I did. I had so much fun those years being young and free from the pressure of school. I was able to take a step back and figure out what really mattered to me and what I wanted to do. When I finally applied to grad school, I did so knowing it was really what I wanted to do. I also fell in love with my [now] husband. We got married after my first year of grad school.

    The rest of my 20's was spent in grad school. studying. traveling. I finished my PhD at 29. All in all, it was a very tough decade and I learned a lot about myself and what I wanted from my life.


* My Goals: Get my PhD. Meet people. See as much of the world as possible.

* Interests: School, travel, outdoors, running, camping, hiking, friends, cooking/baking.

* Most exciting events: I challenged myself a lot to get out of my comfort zone. I travelled extensively in my 20's and many times I travelled alone. One memorable occasion, I was alone in Greece, near the Turkish boarder in a rental car doing field work (geology). I got a flat and the rental had nothing for a flat but a can of compressed air. sigh. I can't speak Greek or Turkish. Long story short, 10 hours later I had a new tire and was on my way. I had so many misadventures like this in my 20s traveling in Europe, Asia and Central America. I feel like they really challenged and stretched me and gave me confidence in myself.

* No regrets. I think even the ""mistakes"" were part of the learning process for me.


*Words of wisdom*

* Don't compare yourself to others. Everyone is different and does things differently. Be yourself, own who you are.

* Take risks. This is the time in your life to try new things. There aren't as many responsibilities or repercussions if those risks don't pan out. Along those lines, don't be afraid to fail. ""Trying does not guarantee results, but not trying will guarantee no results!""

* You will never regret doing the right thing.

* Life is too short for mean people and toxic relationships.

* Take advice with a grain of salt (even mine!). When someone says, ""Don't get married before 30"" or ""Don't wait too long to have kids!"" realize that they are summing up their own personal experiences. Everyone brings different things to the table so keep in mind personal bias when listening to advice. 

Each stage of life brings new challenges and changes. Enjoy your 20's and learn as much as you can about yourself in the process. :)

Codebender,1,False,1304355116,c1s1m4n,,0,,1,t1_c1rye8w,"&gt; Gas is $5/liter in Europe due to taxes.

Right, taxes specifically aimed at discouraging large volumes of road traffic for which there simply is not enough room or fuel.  The same limitations exist in every large American city, though.

Incentives are the way markets change, and as long as buying a 6,000lb, 8-seater SUV for daily commuting is not a *severe* economic burden, then gas is not expensive enough.  If the peak-oil speculators are right it will get there eventually, but by then it will be far too late.

&gt; The same public transportation systems don't work here.

That excuse is older than I am; it's a cop-out and a false dichotomy.

It may not be possible for the U.S. to be as transportation-efficient as Europe, though historically we have achieved it though innovation, but there still remains tremendous room for improvement.

Cities are especially lacking in efficient transportation, and if you've ever been in the bumper-to-bumper traffic in L.A. that stretches as far as you can see in either direction, you'd know that gas is not the only thing our collective inefficiency costs us.

Between efficient city systems replacing a huge volume of car travel and high-speed rail replacing a huge volume of inter-city air travel, we could actually eliminate our dependence on foreign oil within 10-20 years, like every president since Nixon has promised.

The *astronomical* amount of money that currently flows out of the U.S. to pay for our oil consumption would cover the mere billions we need probably as fast as we could build up the infrastructure.

Gitmo is a fucking farce. The simple fact is that governments will *always* abuse their power, and some will do this more than others. I don't know a single person that's been silenced by some seedy government organisation or program, and while that doesn't mean it occurs it pretty much shows it doesn't happen very often.

I am absolutely sickened by people acting like people are being dragged out their houses daily and thrown against prison walls for making some scathing remark or voicing ""dangerous"" opinions on the internet. We quite simply don't live in an autocracy. We don't live in China.

Yes, certain governments will drown out things they don't want to hear and smear the names of those involved just like the oil industry done with global warming back in the day.

Also, while Guantanamo Bay has definitely unlawfully imprisoned innocent people I'd wager not all of them were just ""unlucky"" to be chosen.

We should be vigilant about when a government begins amassing too much power but we should also trust the people in charge to an extent. Hell, even Julian Assange is still allowed to openly address the world without censorship and he royally embarrassed and pissed off the West. If we had the type of governments who just ""silenced"" anyone who dared question the powers that be or discover something that they don't want you to hear he'd have been dead or in prison years ago.

Here's what his death means for me:

I was in middle school when 9/11 happened. I remember the feeling of national unity that followed, and the subsequent abuse of that feeling by our country's executive to get us involved in a senseless war (I still remember getting into a debate with the AP European History teacher at my high school who insisted Iraq had WMDs, while I maintained that they did not. I also suspected at the time that the war was being waged so Bush could win the 2004 election, which now sounds a little far fetched to me. But hey, I was young and mostly right.) I remember the fear they stoked during the 2004 election. And now, we have a president who not only did away with the color coded fear system, but also one who was capable of reframing the issue in his address to the nation (""war on Al Qaeda"" instead of ""war on terror""). We have a president capable of putting the issue to rest.

His death marks a return to normalcy and a triumph of what a nation can achieve with a competent man in charge.

&gt;regulation in Europe does discourage entrepreneurship.

Care to share how without citing more than just your statement stating that? Its well cited and discussed and known how strong Germany's economy is and their government is considered relatively uncorrupted as well.

It seems clear to me the regulation in many countries in Europe level the playing field and allows competition in many markets which only benefits new businesses and in such a system it prevents abuse from existing entities which allows them to benefit without  ""mono(duo)polic issues that are persistent in US Capitalism"".

The peak year of European immigration was in 1907 which was before the spanish civil war, great war, second world war or the soviet union. Did you move their recently? Otherwise what does that have to do with it?

I was more specifically talking about the European immigration that preceded 1776. For your information, if you find it relevant, half of my family was here for that. The Italian side didn't come until 1942. To further your information both sides of my family came to this country to escape ""European nationalism"" be it under the guise of a crown or a dictator.

&gt;The people who moved to america came from different cultural backgrounds to form a nation which was new, presumably they would have been able to learn from their own cultural backgrounds and apply that? Also what is your point here? you are nationalist, your not? Your coming off a bit overly defensive.

I'm not defensive. America has become an increasingly nationalist state, I don't think anyone is going to argue with that but I find it offensive that ""European high culture"" deems in inappropriate considering Europe's long history of supporting it. 

&gt;erm... yes very defensive.

Once again. It's offensive that Europeans ""look down"" on Americans for participating in a system that was pioneered in Europe and still continues to this day. Furthermore, unless I am very much ignorant of my political history but was it not European nationalism which was the underlying root of the entire political stability across the Middle East &amp; North Africa?

&gt;Its just bit odd that The American government wouldn't make a point of saying ""we got him, look"" or ""we are going to give him a trial, western values etc."" like they did with Sadam and rather they just chucked him in the sea .

Saddam was the head of a state. He was given the ""professional courtesy"" of being allowed to be found hiding in a hole, tried, and then hung like a common criminal. Osama bin Laden *was* a common criminal and his execution was no more ceremonious than that. He did not deserve more. Like I said: Let him die nameless.

&gt;...still defensive

...still condescending.

The weird thing is my professors knew that he was in a Pakistani compound since winter, but there was no serious intervention until now.  My main point is though, is the idea and 'event' of eclectic disassociation, which happens when a leadership of a group dies or is halted in some form, and the sleeper cells that have been awaiting/following his command have no leadership, and adapt to their economic and cultural situation, and then activate. You can see a lot of this with small terrorist attacks in Europe, and the Middle-East, and also wartime situations.  It turns out it is harder to fight many different entities with different motives then it is to fight one uniform group.  The question is though, will taking out Bin Laden trigger another disassociation effect, furthering struggles by US troops and creating more of a call for attacks on civilians by terrorists?  Historically, Yes.  Great that we got him, but I wish we captured him rather than killing him (but you can't control that all the time).

2. The aircraft hasn't been properly tested.  It IS a shit aircraft, I agree!  It's slow, has a poor thrust/weight ratio fully loaded, and only has 4 internal hardpoints.  However, it has a huge range and is incredibly fuel efficient.

Maybe you can help me.  Tell me a better fighter than the F-35 we can use.  Something that is

1. Long Range

2. Capable of using NATO armament

3. Something we will be able to access parts for 30+ years (can't be Russian/Chinese, preferably from an ally)

4. Something we won't be alone in maintaining

5. Something that isn't as old as the F/A-18 or older

6. Multirole fighter capable of performing all roles that the F/A-18 currently covers.

Other considerations: Speed, Low-observable profile (Stealth), Modern avionics.

The likely alternatives are the F-15SE, which does not have the same economic prospects of the JSF fighter, and a bunch of European fighters with insufficient range.  Many of these fighters aren't much cheaper (if at all) than the F-35.

The F-22 is especially tempting.  Performs better than the F-35, better stealth profile, twin engine, very fast, only marginally more expensive.  Only it's an air-superiority fighter, cannot adequately perform in ground attack roles, and its export is barred from the US.

Lots of people enjoy being dominated and injured during sex - can I really say, objectively, that their relationship to sex is less ""healthy"" than my own just because I don't share their proclivities?

Your statement reminds me of a famous case in anthropology, where earlier European academics encountering Indian farmers who prioritized keeping their draft animals alive during a drought over providing more food to their starving families by slaughtering said animals decided that that decision meant that said farmers were part of an Eastern culture that didn't value individual human life. And had those Indian animals been similar to European ones, that might have been true, as European oxen would never have been useful again after enduring such starvation. What those anthropologists didn't know what that the particular variety of animal used by the Indians could and did rebound to full productivity when the cyclical droughts ended, meaning that the farmers had in fact chosen to suffer personally in order to maintain their ability to return to full food production after the drought, not because of any bizarre cultural death-wish.

Free pass? I didn't say that. I said that Europeans have no business looking down on America for it--especially considering they still practice it.

&gt;You didn't provide any evidence of Osama's significance. I really think the world stopped caring about him ~5 years ago.

The ""leader"" of the ""free world"" did not. He has been actively seeking his whereabouts and trying to execute him since taking office just as the last ""leader of the free world"" did. The ""world"" may have forgotten about him, the most economically &amp; militarily powerful country in it did not.

&gt;Your dig at European empathy by citing 'the common man's sense of closure' is risible. Should we bring policy and culture into line with Joe the Plumber's sensibilities so he can get closure? Get real.

This has nothing to do with ""joe the plumber"" it has to do with the deaths of over 2000 Americans on 9/11 and the deaths of thousands more during the war. You want evidence that he was significant? 300million Americans say so. That's all the proof anyone should need. Want more? Trillions of dollars were spent. Want more?

&gt;Your bombastic grand-standing about the American army's effectiveness is pathetic. You're like an obese sports fan taking personal credit for his national team's performance. To be completely honest, it just makes you sound really insecure.

I served in Vietnam. I don't give a shit if you think it's bombastic. Fact: If you attack this country, regardless of your nation of origin or present location we will kill you either by bullet or by noose and we will spare no expense in doing so. This isn't bragging. It's a fact.

&gt;The lack of honest debate in your country about the morality of foreign adventurism is genuinely tragic.

Read my post history if you want *my* opinion of foreign adventurism (i.e. military intervention) but this isn't about *my* opinion on that subject, it's about *my* opinion on European elitism.

&gt;As to this event as a cultural turning point for America, I think the opposite might be true. Look at the jeering, flag waving crowds. Do those people look less nationalistic, less petty, less approving of extreme measures? They don't to me.

By your logic then Palin should be elected and Obama will be destroyed in the following election. If, however, I am correct then you will see him reelected, a decrease in the American defense budget, and an increase in spending for social issues.

Some things that will catch you off guard:

(a) Everyone will speak to you in French. It's just a standard assumption, so don't get too peeved...just tell them in Arabic that you are from America and you are in Morocco to study Arabic. It wouldn't hurt to learn some French.

(b) Darija is the awkward cousin of MSA. There are weird grammatical structures, there are ""habitual verbs"" that have different conjugations, and even a letter for the ""g"" sound. You'll obviously learn a lot while here, but it can be disconcerting and stressful for the first two weeks. Many people can speak fusHa, so it's usually not too much of a problem.

(c) I was evacuated from Egypt to Morocco. You may be expecting and/or studying more North African politics or culture than I am, but Morocco is so radically different from its neighbors. It is at the crossroads of Africa, the Middle East, and Europe.

(d) Academics are extremely lax. I know people in the AMIDEAST program (I'm in IES), and we've all noticed that classes aren't necessarily the most rigorous--I don't know whether to attribute this to study abroad in general, but it's definitely something to keep in mind. It can be a good and a bad thing: I'm able to travel more and not work as hard, but a lot of my classes aren't as intensive as my previous classes at AUC. 

(e) Bars are sketch. Even in Rabat. You need to know where to go, otherwise you will be approached by prostitutes. Alcohol is the only expensive part of Morocco--American prices, sometimes more expensive. I would recommend going to Label Vie or Marjane (large grocery stores) if you drink. They have ""caves"". Alcohol is technically illegal for Moroccans--I've had some friends of color that have had some trouble, but usually there are no problems.

(f) You can wear whatever you want. It's fine. If you're a woman, you'll be starred at anyway (especially if you have blond hair). If you're a man, you'll be fine. Not a lot of shorts are worn.

(g) There are ""man-cafes"", as we call them. Soccer is huge here (lots of fair-weather FCB fans), so you will see these cafes packed with tons of men every week.

(h) The water is fine. Only place I would warn against is Fez; they're aquaducts are old and not too sanitary. I drink water from Rabat on a regular basis.

(i) Harira and Tajine are huge here (soup and bowls of meat, oil, spices, and olives). I personally don't enjoy Moroccan food, but prepared to eat lots of this, as well as khubz and couscous (on fridays).

I can think of a lot more, but I have to run. Just message me if you want any more information. I'd be happy to give you awesome places to visit or help you with anything. Good luck! 'bslama.",0,False,1427112525,t3_h1rex,t5_2qh1i,True,AskReddit,0,t1_c1s242l,

A family in 1911 was lucky to be able to afford shoes for everyone. A family in 2011 feels poor if they don't have an Xbox *and* a PS3.

A family in 1911 was working in agriculture, or if they were less lucky, some slum sweatshop, factory, or coal mine, all of which required extremely long hours for little to no pay, and carried an inherent risk of severe injury or death, either of which would eliminate them from any sort of productive employment and income for the rest of their subsequently miserable life.

Even a rich person in 1911 would be far worse off than a welfare recipient now. They could die of something easily cured, like pneumonia, or various forms of cancer. No matter how much money they had it would still take months to get to Europe, Africa, or Asia, and they'd only see a handful of performances from the best musicians in the world.

What you're taught in Israeli primary schools isn't true unfortunately. 

Palestinian Arabs are the descendants of the indigenous Semites that have existed since biblical times. Jews who converted to Christianity under Roman and Byzantine rule, and subsequently to Islam centuries after its arrival. Arabic became the lingua franca of the middle east in the same way Latin did in Europe. The language of the faith, the government, and the upper echelons of society became Arabic, the masses soon followed. If that's what you mean by ""force"" then you are correct, otherwise people were not guillotined for not speaking Arabic or becoming Muslim. You won't find a source for either taking place in the Levant. 

All of the genetic studies prove this as well. Not to mention the common sense observation that they are distinct in dialect, traditions, folk culture, and cuisines from the rest of the middle east, in the same manner that Egyptians are distinct, as well as Iraqis and Algerians. Is the entire Island of Cuba compromised of descendants of Spaniards? I don't think so. Although using Latin America is a bad example since the Spaniards did in fact impose their will by force in many circumstances. You should tell an Egyptian that they descend from the tribe of Quraish, and see what he might say.

So to answer your statements, no, the ""Rashidun"" conquests did not replace the original inhabitants. Indeed, that would've been impossible considering Arabs were vastly outnumbered due to the existence of these ancient centers of civilization to the north.

All of the genetic studies done to prove that Ashkenazi Jews are not of European descent (posted by yourself, if you do not recall) end up proving the opposite of your point, that the Arab inhabitants of Palestine are the indigenous population that has not left for thousands of years, but obviously absorbed elements of the neighboring populations.

Now why would I not consider a European Jews indigenous? Well, they may be descendants of the same region, however they are out of touch with the region and its culture. They have long since adopted the European way of life, values, and language. You ask about where the line can be drawn exactly? I am not sure. But I am sure that 70 years ago I would not have considered a European-looking, European-speaking, and European-behaving individual to be indigenous, and neither would any sane person.

SilentProtagonist,1,False,1304363151,c1s2e98,,0,,1,t1_c1s1g8v,"First of all, I personally think there isn't much of a difference between Europe and the US, which is why I referred to militarism as the West's militarism. Really, I'm not saying Europe is (significantly) better but at least some of us know how to hide our patriotism. The West still drops bombs on targets that they can sell as ""evil"" while claiming some sort of moral superiority. You lot just do it while wrapped in a flag; we hide behind the rhetoric of ""ensuring stability"" or some such nonsense. Our only minor saving grace is that we have implemented some very vaguely socialist safety nets that we're not gladly and smilingly dismantling.

And again, I can see why the New Yorkers would go nuts. I can actually, honestly understand why a couple of firefighters or other people who lost friends, family members and coworkers during the attacks get some sense of closure (although if I may show my ignorance by resorting to something I know only from the Daily Show: the whole shebang about the healthcare bill for 9/11 first responders could potentially offer more fulfilling closure) from all this but when people start cheering ""USA! USA!"" in front of the White House for not much of a reason, it irks me a bit. Probably because the same people are very likely to otherwise adopt the apolitical ""all politicians are crooked bastards anyway"" stance and rile against ""big gubment"". Now that the bad guy killed the badder guy, the formerly bad guy is awesome for a while. It's just sad that this and not something constructive, something that actually helps people is being celebrated. But again, we Europeans just cheer the names of our countries when they win the World Cup, so we all have a stupid, shallow idea of politics and national pride/identity. 

And I googled Bin Laden a bit and came across an article on MSNBC which argued that Osama wasn't just not as wealthy as previously assumed so not even his fortune is particularly important and he's generally an old hat amongst the radicals. Maybe his death now reduces terrorism. Maybe not. We'll see. 

Also, don't glorify the US military - or any military for that matter. It took ten years and the most advanced military behemoth on this planet to track down a guy with a fucked up kidney. In the process, hundreds of thousands of civilians died, thousands of their relatives joined terrorist organizations (speaking of closure, what exactly do you expect some poor Middle Eastern schmuck to do after a Western bomb maimed his little sister? Where's the fucking empathy here? Why the fuck aren't we talking about the thousands of people we - and yes, by we I mean the Americans, the Brits, the Germans, everyone who participated in the war and supplied the war with resources - murdered? Why do we apply empathy selectively?) and the entire thing might have made the world less safe. I don't know. I really don't know if it was all worth it, in the long run. But the army doesn't do magic, after causing tons of collateral damage they finally got that one guy who may or may not have been important. Kudos to that. 

And I'll not go into a debate about whether terrorism justifies intervention but the problem I'm having is that it may have justified the clusterfuck that is the involvement in the Middle East. There was no reason to go after terrorists in Iraq but I can now see Osama's death being used to absolve that little adventure, too. Militarism as such could become more prominent as ""the continuation of politics by other means"" or however that quote goes. 

And no matter how important you think Osama may have been, the war won't end. Barack made that much clear - it will be a slow process. Al-Qaeda won't dissolve, people won't stop hating the West. Western ""imperialism"" will continue to breed hatred. Our lives will improve when we change our foreign policy, our politics and our polity.   

Look, if I come across as anti-American, it's because a) I'm actually ""anti-West"" and you folks are the figurehead for the West and b) we Europeans love to adopt your policies. After all, following your involvement in Iraq, the idea that protecting your county's ""interests"" by force, if necessary, became a little more popular around here, too. I don't want the world to become more of what it already is. That's probably why Barack was beloved here, too. American change would've been European change. Alas, it didn't happen. 

And while I'm at it: whenever most of criticize the US, it's because we silently acknowledge your standing as the leader of the Western World. And we are hoping that you are guiding us towards something better.  ",0,False,1427112726,t3_h28t9,t5_2qh1i,True,AskReddit,0,t1_c1s2e98,

If we just cut our budget overnight: I see China taking Taiwan.

I see Russia fucking with Georgia and other former satellite states. 

I see Pakistani and Indian relations heating and may reach a boiling point over months.

I see North Korea going ape shit and South Korea not existing anymore, China would be forced as the only military power in the region to interact as we decided to draw down.  

I see these wars causing an immigration flood into Europe, who is already experiencing backlash against the Tunisian refugees. In a lot of areas our economic clout, coupled with a plutonium big stick is all that stands between two nations having a bad day and a lot of innocent people dying.

If we demilitarize then the UN has to gain a credible fighting for or else a coalition of military powers, maybe the US, Germany (because of their economy), China (because we're trade buddies), The UK (because they'd feel left out), India (because of their economic influence), Israel (because we're friends) and Pakistan (because they'd flip shit if India was invited and not them), would have to work together to ensure regional stability.

I apologize in return if the questions and my general attitude in my other response are insulting to you. It's not meant to be taken personally.

&gt;I still think Soros's critique of market fundamentalists (whether or not he got the label right) is on point.

I don't so much have a problem with the term ""market fundamentalist,"" in and of itself. But I do have a problem with throwing up ""ideologue"" as though that defeats your opposition's argument. It's like throwing up the word conspiracy, or something. Your opponent is supposed to be immediately discredited.

Why? If someone has all of the reason in the world to believe in something, and very little (or none at all!) to disbelieve in something, why shouldn't they be an ideologue (i.e., an uncompromising adherent to an ideology)? That bothers me.

&gt;Hayek and his followers seem to be taking a deontological stance, in that they simply assert that their position is morally right, no matter what the results of playing it out might be.

Hayek's work is incredibly important now, and in the history of economic and political thought. It was Hayek vs Keynes for the soul of the western world, and Keynes only won because: (a) he died, was therefore ascended to intellectual sainthood, and (b) Hayek published *The Road To Serfdom*, which warned that the people who are running the show may lead us down ""this"" road too far into a new kind of serfdom.

And about his contributions to *the conversation*? His contributions to social philosophy? Economic thought? Extremely important.

But he is not the largest influence on the Austrian School today. The Austrian School today (taken as being centered around the Mises Institute) is Rothbardian in nature. The Austrian School has always been about methodology -- it's concerned with what is economics, what sort of a science is it, and how do we approach the world from that perspective.

Ever since Rothbard took over the scene, however, and especially with the intense politicization of the discussions since the rise of Ron Paul and the surge in interest in Austrian Economics, adherence replaced discussion over methodology with discussion over results.

So in a sense, you're right: there is a strong trend among ""free market capitalist"" circles promoting a position as a moral right regardless of outcome -- just with the assumption that it'll play out better than the alternative -- but it isn't the Austrian School tradition, per se.

There's a growing conflict in the Austrian School community between Rothbardians (Mises Institute) and traditional Austrian School economists (ironically, the Rothbard Institute in Europe, and most of the economics department faculty at George Mason University), and what you're talking about has something to do with it.

&gt;The Chicago gang like to claim that their policies would lead to optimal efficiency, but then when they lead to collapse they just say that must obviously be optimal efficiency and leave it at that.

That's just human nature. When the Soviet Union collapsed, when the Soviet system was proven to be unsustainable, Communists (big C emphasized) everywhere were split into two camps: a few that said, ""well, maybe we were wrong"" and a whole lot of them that said, ""that's only because Stalin was in charge... in Trotsky would have became the man!!""

Edit: I want to point something else out quickly concerning the Soros article, and in particularly how he mis-categorizes Hayek. I want this to be understood: when you refer to someone as having a methodology and worldview different than his own, and when you refer to someone as believing in something wholly (like an apostle would) even though that person is a proponent of policies that go against that thing.

That paragraph is entirely ill-composed. But this is what I mean: Hayek argued for capitalism, but also was a little more than sympathetic to the modern liberal concerns of social welfare programs, for example. You can't be an apostle of unfettered capitalism if you believe in government regulation, and (even limited) social welfare programs. So what really got me started into this whole discussion is that -- Soros is being disingenuous, and I want to know if it's intentional or not.",0,False,1427112809,t3_gzpdo,t5_2r7mh,True,PhilosophyofScience,0,t1_c1s2km4,

* General respect of rules
* Little bureaucracy
* Depending on where you live, less crime

It's funny that people have blamed the wars (not that I believe that continuing them is a good idea) for the debt crisis. The wars are a fairly minor part of a much deeper crisis, we (and most of the first world) spend far too much of the GDP on transfer payments. We have a serious debt crisis, and neither side has the political will to make a real dent in the problem.

Hilariously, the Democrats are able to get away with saying we can fix the problem by taxing the top 1%. That just isn't possible for two main reasons.

First, the top 1% is very capable of taking its income and moving that money to non-U.S. sources. It's actually easy, just sell U.S. assets, use those funds to buy assets in Switzerland, Brazil, or any other rich friendly nation. Then move to any other country on earth, and don't pay the IRS ever again. There are downsides, but if we start taxing at European rates this will slowly start happening (with negative economic results). If you don't believe me, look at what's happened to California vs. Texas since one became a tax nightmare and one a tax haven.

Second, and more importantly, even if you confiscated 50% of the income of the top 1%, you'd still be in a deficit (increasing annually due to medicare and social security). For the last year we have data, the top 1% earned 20% of the income, and paid 38% of the federal income tax (23% tax rate, $400 Billion). Even if you could get $400 Billion more, you'd just put a dent in the deficit (debt currently increases by $4 Billion per day).",0,False,1427112997,t3_h22c8,t5_2cneq,True,politics,0,t1_c1s2yy1,

Simplest advice is to avoid the Indian-owned tailors in the tourist areas. Their game is simple but clever: they will ask you how long you're here for, and what day you're going home. They will then make your suit ready for collection on or just before the day you leave, so that when it falls apart you won't be able to return it. Simple ruse. These are the guys who sell suits for $150 etc. It sounds too good to be true, and it is.

The best tailors are actually Thai. They use high quality materials and their craftsmanship is excellent. They cost about 30% less than European or US tailors on average, and you can find them by asking around, but basically (this might sound racist but in Thailand racism is actually a useful tool for staying out of trouble sadly), just look in the shop windows and if the owner is Thai, you're probably onto a winner. The Silom area of Bangkok has a few (near Patpong, for a tourist reference).

&gt;The global number of Muslims is expected to jump by 35% in the next 20 years, growing twice as fast as the non-Muslim population, according not to these “Eurabia mongers,” but to the famous US Pew Forum, which published projections Muslim population growth between 2010 and 2030.

Note the sleigh of hand: the author buttresses his argument about the coming of ""Eurabia"" by referencing a demographical data point about .. the *global* Muslim population.

It's interesting to see how, so far, the author just posits the increase of the Muslim population as something that is by definition scary. He still hasn't come around to arguing *why* increasing numbers of Muslims are frightening, and won't for a while longer - the first full eight paragraphs are nothing but panicky demographic numbers about how there will be ever more Muslims, and it's just kind of assumed that we should all think that really scary:

&gt;The most frightening figures are in Europe. Some of the biggest increases in Europe’s Muslim population in absolute numbers over the next 20 years are expected to occur in the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Germany.

But the author carefully switches between absolute and relative measures to emphasize the most 'scary' one. E.g.:

&gt;The Muslim populations in Italy and Sweden are projected to “more than double in size.” 

Scary. Considering that estimates of the Muslim population in Italy range from 1.3% to 2.4% (as per Wikipedia, sorry, I'm lazy) and peg their share at some 5% of the population in Sweden (as per Wikipedia and [Muslims in the EU: Cities Report](http://www.soros.org/initiatives/home/articles_publications/publications/museucities_20080101/museucitiesswe_20080101.pdf), that means that by 2030, they will make up ... oh, 4% and 10% of the Italian and Swedish population, respectively. Arabic majority not so much.

That doesn't stop the author from indulging in a host of apocalyptic language, though: ""We are living through the self-extinction of the European civilization"", ""a confident Islamist minority are turning the cradle of Western civilization into its grave"". Never mind that most second- and third-generation Muslims are hardly ""Islamists"". Going back to the example of Sweden, the newspaper Sydsvenskan [writes](http://www.sydsvenskan.se/sverige/article140868.ece) (sorry for the Google Translate): ""According to the estimates are 5 percent of practicing Muslims in the sense that they always go for Friday prayers and observe the Quran's commandment to pray five times a day.""

The article is full of unsubstantiated assertions of dubious likelihood, e.g.:

&gt;The Muslim Brotherhood runs most European mosques.

There's also plenty of selective quoting:

&gt;The Economist, a publication far from anti-Islamic ideas, spoke of Rotterdam as a “Eurabian nightmare.”

[Here's that Economist article](http://www.economist.com/node/12724966). The sentence in question reads: ""On the face of things, Rotterdam has the ingredients for a Eurabian nightmare."" On the face of things, indeed - but, as the article then concludes: 

&gt;From Amsterdam to Leicester, conurbations that now thrive on diversity could face problems if economic pressures put an end to the municipal largesse that keeps all groups happy. But at least this much can be said: there are enough examples of Muslims and non-Muslims learning to rub along, through the trade-offs of local politics, to disprove the fatalists. In urban Europe, there is nothing predestined about the clash of civilisations.

Quite. File the original article under ""dishonest, self-serving fear-mongering"".

Just so you know, ""trap"" and ""skeet"" are formal games, each with a particular setup and a regulating body.

""Trap"" is a game where you stand 16 to 27 yards behind a thrower that launches clays away from you.  There are several variants of trap, and in the USA an official trap competition will include three: 16 yard singles, handicapped singles, and doubles.  Each one has a very specific set of rules and procedures, including what a regulation field looks like.

""Skeet"" is supposedly named for a derivation of a European word ""to shoot"".  It's another very specific game that involves shooting from different stations around a semi-circle at clays thrown from two launchers on opposite sides.  The setup of an official skeet field is also subject to specific regulations, so no matter where you go in the country it should be the same.  If you say that you ""shot skeet"", that's what you're implying you did.

I grew up shooting at hand-thrown clays in a field in Pennsylvania.  It's a great way to learn, and it's a lot of fun.  When you start to get good, try your hand at one of the regulation games.  They're also a ton of fun, anyone can learn to be competitive, and you'll learn a lot.  There are a lot of things shooting at an official trap or skeet field that aren't possible (or safe) to do in a field with a hand thrower.

If anything, it highlights the connection your are making between the concept of foreign professors and terrorists.  Shame on you.

After BARELY completing 3 out of 4 years by not attending class, you are not doing so well in the 4th year which arguably is the most difficult year since you not only have the most advanced classes that utilize knowledge you've learned till then, but you also have to complete your thesis.

Do this surprise me?  no.

In fact, a recent USA News study highlights the downward spiral of American competitiveness when it comes to science and engineering.  This is NOT due to foreign professors, but is due to the college culture of no discipline, party, and lack of commitment. 

Other countries from Korea, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Brazil actively recruit American and European professors.  In fact a good percentage of Engineering and Science professors are from Europe and America.  Do you hear Indian or Chinese undergrads complaining about not understanding their professors?

JimmyHavok,1,False,1304371455,c1s3ald,,0,,1,t1_c1s2gpo,"social liberty (a) ; economic liberty (b) ; equality (c)

Power is the ability to enforce one's will, through whatever means.  The more of that ability you have, the more power you have.

I don't claim to be ideology-free, however, I hope that my positions are well grounded in pragmatic observation.  I think Soros's ideology is similar.

I would argue that you need a measure of all three liberties, or you end up without any of them, and I would tend to focus most on (a) as being the form of liberty that the other two serve, in that without (a), the other two are moot, but with strong (b) and (c), societies will move toward (a).

With pure economic liberty, any positive feedback causes instability, and the system ends up with a concentration of economic power in a small number of hands.  With pure economic liberty, that concentration of power can destroy (a) if, for example, a small cohort decide that only one social group can eat at the lunch counter, or a certain minority aren't to be employed (I've seen market fundamentalists argue that this has to be allowed under freedom of association).  The only way to restrict that is to make sure that there is some degree of (c), so that wide disparities in power do not take hold.  Concentration of economic power also destroys (b), in that those who are outside the concentration of economic power that is allowed by (b) find their economic choices restricted, so even if technically, (b) is complete, practically, it is not.  The end result of too great an emphasis on (b) is eventually feudalism.  Think of it as a marble on top of a hill, if the marble goes too far one way, it rolls down the hill to a point where it will never get back up without an extreme application of outside force.  The deontologists argue that this doesn't matter, since the system, whatever its end state, was arrived at from what they consider to be morally valid premises.
 
I can find examples of people who claim that their emphasis is on (b) who argue that they shouldn't be forced to support public education, for example, because it gives other people's children an equal chance at economic success as their own children (Dinesh D'Souza has made precisely that argument).  This is the slope of the hill that the marble will roll down unless it is restricted.

Putting equality into the system as a value adds negative feedback, since it will rein in those concentrations of power that lead away from actual, empirical (b), rather than theoretical (b).  Of course, genuine equality will never exist in the real world, since everyone has different abilities and backgrounds.  But ensuring that *at a minimum* there is only an allowable range of inequality keeps a system meritocratic, and allows market forces to work as envisioned by Smith, instead of degenerating into a mass of oligopolies.

Whenever we see greater moves toward (b) and away from (c), we see those concentrations of power develop.  The libertarians argue that this is *only* because there isn't *more* (b), and that somehow, doing more of what is causing the problems will make it go away.

They also argue that enforcing (c) causes economic collapse, pointing at Communist systems as proof.  But since Communism as we've seen it had neither (a), (b), nor (c), that's a weak argument.

I believe that the moves toward increased (a) and (c) from the New Deal and the reconstruction of Europe were a large part of the half-century of affluence the Western world has seen.  The recent economic instability and crises we've had have been due to a 30-year move away from (c) toward (b).

&gt;Can you name anyone who believes (D)

There's a difference between believing (D) trumps all evidence, and a conditional belief in (D) based on evidence.  At some point, one has to have some *a priori* assumptions, but the safest course is to minimize their number and complexity, and constantly do a back-check on whether the results of those assumptions match observations.  The ideologue will not do that, that is what makes him an ideologue.  I think we can distinguish between having an ideology and being an ideologue by the degree to which facts on the ground affect the ideas in question.

Soros didn't just say ""youse guys is wrong and I'm right, ya heah me?"" he laid out a reasoned critique of a central assumption of a particularly dominant economic ideology (and I call it an ideology because of its denial of empirical facts).

The thing is that this is a great coup for Obama (which is definitely better than the last 'president', or Trump). And generally for the US. And maybe even for the ~~imaginary~~ 'war against terror'. In the end, I personally probably don't care whether Osama is alive, as long as he doesn't do more sh** than AlQaeda does anyway. So, it probably doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things, but the relevant actors have a vested interest in pretending it to be the case.

Thus the point is one of principle: Will you believe your government blindly without evidence (e.g. Iraq's WMD, the 'guilt' of many Guantanamo 'prisoners', ...) or will you demand the truth? Maybe you prefer the lie. But maybe it would stop a lot of bloodshed and violence to demand that your government shows evidence.

Will you believe that Osama bin Laden has been killed in this operation (and, say, not in 2003, when he was already believed to be dead) just because someone says so? And why the hell would they kill him if they wanted 'justice'? Maybe it is a massive scheme to cover up evidence for who-knows-what.

&gt;7. (C) COMMENT:

&gt;XXXXXXXXXXXX's frustration with the Bulgarian government's lame and insincere reform efforts was striking. It appears to be spreading in Brussels where at least the working level appears to be feeling ""buyers remorse"" over letting Bulgaria and Romania into the club too early. According to reliable contacts, Brussels Eurocrats have dubbed enlargement fatigue the ""Bulgarian Break,"" further tarnishing Bulgaria's bad image within the EU (REFTEL A).

Und in dieser Situation sollen jetzt auch noch nordafrikanische Staaten aufgenommen werden?  

Internationale Analysten haben für den jetzigen Zustand der EU den Begriff  *""Enlargement Fatigue""* geprägt. 
Details here: 

[Enlargement Fatigue in the European Union: From Enlargement to Many Unions](http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/portal/rielcano_eng/Content?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/elcano/elcano_in/zonas_in/europe/dt13-2009)

[Enlargement Fatigue in the European Union](http://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.barnesrichardson.com/files/tbl_s47Details%255CFileUpload265%255C126%255Cforgue_fatigue.pdf&amp;sa=U&amp;ei=sie_TcSWNMOSswasw6iLBg&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAC&amp;sig2=vIEbmbKsQZbnHd4KKRFR8w&amp;usg=AFQjCNEPuYxPSKDhjO_CQWYRr_vTBzD9Lg)

&gt;Experience with the 2004 enlargement has shown that
several of these fears may be justified. For instance, the
UK has seen an inflow of roughly 600,000 workers from
Poland and other 2004 members. While the British gov-
ernment indicated that these migrants have mostly
helped “fill gaps” in Britain’ s labor market, this large of an
nflux in a relatively short period of time has led to some
concerns in Britain.

&gt;However, Britain’ s low unemployment rate (below five
percent) helps lessen the pressure from this influx. In France,
with over nine percent unemployment, and Germany , with
over 11 percent unemployment, the impact of 600,000 for-
eign workers entering the country would likely lead to a
much more significant backlash than it has in Britain.

&gt;The unexpected consequence of the migration of
workers from the 2004 members to the west has been a
serious lack of available workers in the Central European
countries. For instance, Lithuania has experienced a net
emigration of 400,000 people from the country of four
million people. This has led some of the Central Euro-
pean countries to turn to non-EU countries like Ukraine,
Russia, Moldova, and Belarus for laborers.


&gt;Similarly, some of the original EU members have
experienced a rise in criminality that appears to be based
n Central and Eastern Europe. Europol indicated that
countries like Austria, Germany, and France have major
organized crime groups drawn from the 2004 members.
Bulgaria and Romania have both struggled with corrup-
ion and organized crime and can be expected to contin-
ue to struggle with these issues. Insofar as Turkish
criminal gangs are already active in Germany  Austria, the
UK, and other EU nations, this concern among the EU
citizenry is likely to continue to contribute to resistance
to Turkey’s membership in the EU in the future.

Nobody has yet been able to demonstrate renewable energy that has the same benefits of fossil fuels at a lower cost - particularly when the price of oil can fluctuate from $150/bbl to $35/bbl and back to $100/bbl all within a 4 year timespan.  Wind and Solar are inconsistent, and thus require massive overcapacity and an enormous power grid.  Last time I checked, they were able to pull a profit at something around $100-120/bbl oil prices, but since we haven't seen those prices go that high - and stay there - we haven't seen them really take off yet.  Besides, battery technology really isn't there for electric cars so far unless you go the hybrid route.  Nuclear is a mature, reliable, and safe option, but has enormous construction costs and regulatory nightmares - all brought to you by the anti-nuke crowd, and it still doesn't solve the problem with fueling cars.

The sad fact is that oil is really really good at doing what it does.  It's been really cheap for a long time, has an extraordinarily high power density, and has huge advantages in the network effect that it is already the big player in the market.  It's going to take big price rises in gas as well as big investments in alternative fuels in order to shift away.

In Sweden you don't walk into a bar and get a job - you need a degree in bartending. Most jobs in Sweden recquire degrees. The jobs which don't are few and in high demand since Sweden has a high youth unemployment. So seriously - get a job before moving and everything will be fine.

F.) EQUALLY IMPORTANT: Don't just move here on a whim without a backup plan. If you've never lived in Sweden you don't know if you'll like living here. Visiting is not the same as living. Which is why I often suggest that people study here for a year or so before considering moving.

i believe this gives some statistics on those killed. very high numbers. and I'm not sure if you are calling me or the Americans celebrating as patriotic hypocrites but either way thanks for the broad generalization there. because thats what ALL Americans who are celebrating are right patriotic hypocrites? just like ALL Europeans are hippie intellectuals who are scared of a fight right?

I have never said that the war on terror and the way it has been waged is in any way justified. i have always felt that it was merely an excuse for the military industrial complex of this country to suck off the taxpayers teat. 

What i stated was that people who are celebrating in the streets have a right to do so. And beyond that the people who say they shouldn't celebrate should fuck off. people on reddit always complain about conservatives ( and rightly so) interfering in the business of others. yet if a reddit stands and judges someone else its all good?

Ironically, several papers by economists of the time proved how slavery was less economically efficient and actually produced less at a higher cost than paid workers.

For example at the start of every game I send my overlord out to the side of their base, outside, so it is position later on to go take a peak inside. When I play a 4 player map I just guess and send it out, and use my 12 drones to scout location, and then move it accordingly.

That's why I deleted it, and posted this.

I was about to send you a message to explain my stance. :) 

I wanted to reply with this immediately. I'll edit and weigh in (granted I have something to say) after I read the rest of your message.

**Edit:** I read your message, here are my two cents.

If we must blame an entity, that article suggests that entity should be the United Kingdom and/or Grivas, and the Turkish Cypriots for responding in kind.

Turkey is guilty of trying to force it's conterpart's hands, from what I can see, it did not allow for enough consultation time twice during this encounter. It is perhaps wrong to press for contingent territory for TCs, it is definitely wrong in occupying such a large portion of the land and expecting it to be a TC state. It is wrong to hope that securing the Turkish-Cypriot enclaves in a ""net"" rather than precisely liberating them would lead to the international community ceding the land to TCs. I also cannot see the logic behind TCs and thus Turkey pushing for exclusive seperation. (100% Turkish vs. 100% Greek)

I cannot pass judgment on whether or not TCs were wrong to declare unilateral autonomy. Note, they did that without support from Turkey, and Turkey's decision to support it was the most logical move for Turkey at the time. Also, the only one that correctly rewarded the solidarity the TCs expressed with Turkey, and one that didn't betray the trust they placed in Turkey to escape prosecution.

I cannot know how Greek-Cypriot national identity was back then. I assume they viewed themselves more Hellenic than Cypriot. I'm reasonably sure this does not continue today. But Greek Cypriots were wrong to seek enosis without the TC blessing, or at the worst without allaying TC fears.

The then-head of UN is at fault for forcing Turkey's hand, even though his move was warranted. The resolution, in my opinion, does not accurately depict Turkey's presence on the island. Not then, and not now. 

As far as ""expansionism"" goes, I do not see what use Turkey would have of a military base in Cyprus, when it can project its hard power on the surrounding nations just as easily from it's mainland (as demonstrated in the Cyprus dispute).

**Regardless, these are matters of the past. Since the political and social dynamics of Greek Cypriots are significantly different much like the Turkish Cypriot social dynamics, it is wrong to continue talks on the same pretext and play the blame game.**

Turkish Cypriots obviously do not want Turkey with them anymore, much like how Greek Cypriots are content with Cyprus being a state rather than Hellenic territory. Turkish ""occupation"" will end the minute the local government tells them to go. As such, it's not much of an ""occupation"" when the minute the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots reconcile, they will voluntarily withdraw. Thus, it is wrong to treat it as a fundamental problem.

If one doubts that Turkey will leave the minute TCs give the word, they should realize that Turkey wants to enter the EU much more than it wants the welfare of TCs, at least that is the present situation.

But it will be expected to subsidize the development of the north Cyprus - since it will be indirectly responsible for the sanctions, if it leaves as an invading power. It might not have a problem with it, but this has to be pronounced for it to happen. 

For that, Europe has to stop viewing North Cyprus and Turkey as a single entity. That is the only thing that will break the deadlock ideally, that will lead to a solution, imo.

ctkvhd,2,True,1304379330,c1s40he,,0,,2,t3_h2am3,"I apologize for the length but you did ask for some tips and there are quite a bit that may or may not be obvious to a new player:

* Pay attention to your hand limit.  Are you starting your turn with six cards in hand?  If so you will have eight at the end of the turn so think about something you can do with the card.  Building a research station with that card, if possible, is a lot more useful than throwing it in the discard pile.  This isn't always convenient so you may want to plan ahead.  You will probably get attached to finding cures, but a good network of research stations, will pay off big in the long run since traversing long distances on the board will eat up a lot of actions.

* Obviously you can't use too many cards for travel since you need them cures, but a well timed Charter Flight can be very useful.  When I first started I tended only to think of cards in terms of Direct Flights.  Say you are in Atlanta first round and need to cure the three cubes starting in Baghad.  You don't have any black cards, but you have the card for Bogota.  You can now get to Baghad on the first turn, via charter flight from Bogota and remove at least one cube.  Or think of that from a share knowledge perspective.  You are in Osaka and the Medic with four black cards is in Baghdad.  You have Baghdad but can't direct flight without losing it (unless you are the Troubleshooter from the expansion).  You do have Seoul in your hand though.  Use the Charter Flight and get the card to the Medic.

* Learn to keep track the cards in the discard infection pile and the current infection rate so you understand the general probability of each card will coming up again.  So if you have nine cards in the infection discard pile and you just moved the infection rate up to three with an epidemic then each of those nine cities has a one in three chance of coming up on the next turn, two in six on the next and so on.  Cards that you had seen before but didn't make it into the nine cards discard pile before reshuffle won't show up for at least three turns.  Per game rules (page 6) you are always free to explore the cards in the discard piles.

* If there are only two epidemics left, you generally can ignore cities with one cube since the most that city will ever have is three with the exception of outbreak trouble nearby.

* With that said eradication is hardly worth it unless you have a Medic who can treat all cubes four cities in a turn instead of just two.

* Keep a Researcher nearby your research station network so other players can get to the researcher quickly and get back to the research station to find a cure quickly.  Each turn you are away from a research station is probably another turn where you are being forced to do unwanted discards.  Also remember, per page 5 of the rules, ""The Researcher can utilize this ability when involved in Share Knowledge actions on ANY player's turn"".

* Cities with three cubes obviously demand the most attention as people above have mentioned. However, some spots on the board are more dangerous than others.  Santiago can be ignored as it has only one connection and generally cost you a turn to get in and then another to get out.  St. Petersburg only has three connections, and only one of those go to another blue city.  A blue cube in black Moscow doesn't mean much.  If Istanbul blows however, you have a very big mess and a lot of black cubes being used up going to cities that might be flipped up from the bottom of the deck.

* One of the most dangerous situations on the board that might not be obvious is two adjacent cities of the same color with two cubes each.  This is a situation that can turn bad very quickly because if just one outbreaks then the other is set up to outbreak soon and thus cause a double outbreak which probably means one of the shared neighboring, adjacent cities might cause a triple outbreak.  This is more of a problem in europe, the middle east and asia than the americas.

* Never forget the Dispatcher's ability to bring two pawns together for an action.  The Dispatcher is easily the deepest and most rewarding role in the game when you have more than two players and you can do some pretty amazing things with his special abilities.

It sounds like you are playing a two player game.  I would recommend that you and your wife both play two roles to get a feel for how the four player game works.  The base game's roles are amazingly synergistic and if you get the dispatcher and op expert you are going to have a lot of interesting and deeper choices open up for you in the game.  The expansion's roles water down this synergistic effect some and make the game harder with four in a lot of cases.

Skill will only take you so far in this game and some initial shuffles of the infection and player deck are almost impossible to overcome.  The worst situation is being stuck with roles who can't share knowledge easily with a deck that is giving you two sets of threes of two different colors, and no more in each hand draw after draw forcing you to discard.

--EDIT--
Some more points I remembered as I was writing another response.  Special events can be played at any time.  There is usually an ideal time to play.
* Play a Forecast, if you have it, immediately after either the first or second epidemic.  This way you can sort cards that would cause an outbreak to the bottom and have two turns to treat rather than just one.  On the third epidemic the infection rate has moved from two to three but Forecast is still only letting you look at 6 cards.
* Likewise, One Quiet Night is good to play immediately after an Epidemic.
* Play a Resilient population between steps 2 (Infect) and 3 (Intensify).  Notice the text of point 2 on the green Epidemic card.  ""Discard the card"".  You may, if there are no other cities with three cubes, remove the card that was just turned up from the bottom of the deck that now has three cubes on it because that card is in the discard pile.
* You usually want to save Government Grant for a time when someone finally comes up with a cure to place the research station within reach of their next turn.  Can also be put on a city where Share Knowledge could take place.

You like this guy, but you've only been together a few months- you're still in the pink cloud phase where everything is wonderful and the sex is still new and exciting.

Cue long distance.

Being away from one another from June to January is going to put a strain on your relationship.  It is possible for it to work, but that should not be the first instinct, unless this is serious love and you've got enough relationship experience to understand what that actually is.  Please note, at 21, I certainly did not (although I thought I did).

If you stay together and end up fighting/resenting each other during the period of long distance, but remain together, things will end terribly.  It breeds codependence and a feeling of being ""owed"" by your partner, if you are still upset about what went on.  One or another of you will be upset enough not to make a relationship at another time viable.  

If you break up before the long distance, you can go off to Europe, he can go to college, and you can be free to see other people.  It doesn't mean you still can't talk to each other, and it doesn't mean you won't get back together later, and this is probably the best way to prevent resentment from either of you. There is no rule that says that either of you MUST sleep with someone else, and you each could make the independent decision NOT to do so (note: it's important that you don't put subtle pressure one each other to do this).  With no expectations except cordial and polite interaction whenever the mood suits you, neither of you will be giving anything up.  Hell, you can even visit him during the summer, and vice versa- you should just remove the official title.

The bottom line is you are both young, and full of delicious hormones.  Chances are relatively high that if you stay together one of you will cheat, or at least forgo some other opportunities (especially on your term abroad- gf/bf situation can hold you back since you've gotta make time to talk, etc.).  Here I'm not talking about lost sexual opportunities (or at least not exclusively), but also lost personal interaction opportunities, and lost experiences.  

The fights I used to have were many, but here are some common ones:

I have female friends, she is not with me, she gets suspicious and/or jealous, those emotions manifest themselves in negative ways in our daily interactions and I start to resent her.

We agree to make time to talk to one another, but are thousands of miles apart- real life happens, and one of us misses the appointment.  Combine that with whatever negative emotions you might have to deal with, and the uncontacted partner will feel abandoned or, again, suspicious.

Worst of all: one of you has to comfort the other about the time you ""should be spending together"" and cannot.  You're on your term abroad and have to deal with a constant feeling of longing or sadness, whilst dealing with the desires that confront you while abroad.  Your friends on the trip don't accommodate your relationship/see it as foolish, and start to talk shit about you, avoid you, or leave you out of group activities.

TL;DR:  Avoid negative consequences for both of you- agree to part ways as friends, and leave getting back together on the table.  If you can't do this amicably, this wasn't going anywhere anyway.",0,False,1427113523,t3_h2l16,t5_2qjvn,True,relationships,0,t1_c1s4350,

I would relate the event to the Olympics: A global competition that happens every four years, only I suspect the world cares a lot more about the World Cup than it does the Olympics, which makes it incredibly exciting. There is no other event in the world that incites the passion and fervor of nations like the World Cup, and every country has a crack at it. North Korea even qualified for the most recent WC last Summer (they got thoroughly embarrassed, though). USA isn't terrible and we do have a few really good players (particularly Landon Donovan and Clint Dempsey). They aren't the best in the world, but they are world class. Considering the fact that the best athletes in America are likely playing other sports (NFL, NBA, MLB), the fact that we can manage to sometimes get ourselves a top 10 world ranking is quite a feat. I think we are getting better.
  
I basically only become a big soccer fan every four years, but you can catch the United States playing World Cup qualifier matches in the years leading up the WC, which I try my best to watch, and then there's also the Euro competition which happens two years before/after the World Cup. Not AS great, but the level of international play and passion is nearly the same; only no US to root for, Europe only (in which case, I support my ancestry nations). I'm not a big enough soccer fan that I follow leagues, which play year-round (MLS is a very difficult watch, and I can't bring myself to take interest in a foreign league which I have no ties to), my interest is primarily in those two major events and the US team games leading up. I don't expect you to become a fan today, because there's nothing exciting happening right now (in my opinion), but in a few years, try to catch the US games and root for your country. You'll recognize who the best players are pretty quickly. The low scoring is rough (which is a major reason I can't get into hockey) but as a basketball fan, I appreciate the extreme level of control some players have over the ball; similar to street ball razzle dazzle.

I can understand why you say that and why you got up votes, but it is flat out wrong.

Anti-Semite means hatred of Jews, that is what the term was created to mean. It is a 19th century German term.

Never mind that Ethiopian languages are from the same language group.

I think you have to remember that America is a highly influential country which has made numerous controversial foreign policy moves recently and it is oblivious that many will take those as reasons to pass judgement on the country. 

In my opinion you need to take a step back and realise some things:

When someone passes judgement on the political moves and ideals of a nation they are not (unless they are fools) passing judgement on the citizens of that country. 

You were born, or emigrated to North America, THAT'S IT I was born in Britain. I am not my country and you are not yours.

&gt; LOL gel well is an understatement.

Not really. Hitler wasn't opposed to the doctrinal teachings of Catholicism, but rather the underlying power-structure. In fact, he compared his anti-Semitic views to the historical treatment of Jews by the church. His use of the phrase 'final solution' was in part a reference to the pogroms carried out against the Jews by the church, which he regarded as ultimately ineffectual. He criticized the church of Rome for this in Mein Kampf, and blatantly told them in 1933.

Although quotations can be cherry-picked to argue both for and against Hitler's Catholicism, it is certain that he was a Christian of some sort, though probably not a devout Catholic. He saw, or pretended to see, a place for the Catholic church in his empire, but only under the direct control of government. Hitler saw Jesus as the true god, and adopted those elements of Christianity which held the Jews responsible for his death. There is no controversy in stating that the anti-Semitic attitude in Europe was largely a result of the historically consistent teachings of the Catholic church. It is telling that, though specifically condemning the Nazis for certain atrocities, the Pope did not once officially protest the mistreatment of the Jews, despite many specific requests from Jewish leaders requesting intervention.

Regardless of his true religious beliefs, Hitler viewed organized religion as a political force with a wide following, and typically, as an opponent. Similarly, the Catholic church saw Hitler as an opponent of communism, and so initially supported him in that regard. The motivations for their interactions were completely political at policy level, but the lack of condemnation from the Vatican combined with their historically racist ideologue disguised this from the German population. I'll be trite and sum up by saying that Catholicism was the opiate of the masses.

If you want the outline of the arguments for Catholic complicity in the holocaust, read Avro Manhatten. He's pretty anti-Catholic, so you may want to assume bias and cross-check what he writes.

&gt; there was no pagan doctrine from my understanding. Like many groups they found powerful symbols, which were pagan, and adopted them.

Take this with a grain of salt: I have read that some of the SS (some of whom certainly were anti-Christian, though I think around 1/4 were Catholic) participated in pagan rituals for functions such as baptisms and weddings. It is easy to see why they would feel a need to replace the Christian ceremonies they had abandoned. In fact, one of the aspects Hitler admired about the Catholic church was their sense of pomp and ritual. ",0,False,1427113597,t3_h1wi7,t5_2qh2p,True,atheism,0,t1_c1s48rn,

I'm angry because just a few posts ago you were whining about being a second class citizen when it's painfully obvious that the reverse is true.

Secondly, since Europeans have landed they've gone completely out of their way to make their lives miserable. This isn't some crap like, ""Oh, well it happened yesterday so like get over it."" More like over a couple hundred years little things like starvation, spreading disease, rape, abuse, displacement, forced sterilizations, forcibly removing thousands of our children from our homes without investigations to back it up, keeping us confined to reserves till only a few decades ago, and other boring uninteresting shit like that. As long as the government isn't trying to fucking kill them, they don't care about what it does and despite whatever fantasy world you live in that says government is noble and just, you simply aren't going to convince a people that have endured as much as them that this is the case. 

Those numbers are from the 2006 census Sherlock. 85% White, 10% visible minority, 5% Aboriginal. I'm also half white, so no, not all white people are the same, just a lot of them have the same perspective on Indians much like the r/canada in general. 

I also never said anything about ""EVIL WHITE CANADA"", I just don't like snobby non-aboriginals who plead unfairness without even realizing the full scope of the Indian experience. I'm only half indian not even living on the reserve and the experience for me is overwhelming a lot of the time. Death, despair, rape, and more. This doesn't happen to some stranger you know, it happens to my family. Cousins, uncles, aunts, sisters (at least the ones that survived). You would not believe the shit that I have been privy too but frankly, I don't really give a shit if you do understand. I ask for no pity, never have, never will.

Finally, the Indian Act. There's a world of difference between how it is written and how it is implemented. First off, our rights have been eroding consistently since it was written (newest revision was in the 1980's. Before that it was the British North American Act). It was supposedly based off of the treaties that were signed to guarantee the government of canada the vast majority of land and resources canadians now enjoy. That house that your mom has, your grandparents had, etc. is only yours because of those treaties or, as I prefer to recognize them, legal arrangements between sovereign nations. The government got trillions upon trillions of dollars worth of land and resources in exchange for a few meager rights for the descendants. As an Integrated Indian, I get fuck all. I don't have a home on the reserve. I pay property taxes. I pay income taxes for work I do off reserve. The only things I got were a decent education (of which I spent years on a wait list...not all of us are that fortunate) and some dental. Not really what I would call reason for a massive outrage or pretense to say that we all get our lives handed to us on a silver platter, but there it is. Bottom line is, no matter how much you whine that it isn't fair to poor middle class you, the sheer scope of what canada gained from these treaties exponentially outweighs what the treaties supposedly provide to us. Canada is legally obligated to provide the provisions of those treaties to us in exchange for the land and resources you enjoy.

Canada (still a Dominion) did a lot in WW1, but it did a lot in WW2 as well. America joined WW2 in Dec. 1941, although it didn't actually *do* anything vs the Germans until Operation Torch in November '42. WW2 started in Sept. 39, so it went on for 2 years before the Yanks enters, 3 before they did anything of note in Europe.

WW1 started on the 28 July 1914. The US entered the war on the 6 April 1917. It's first serious action was in the Third Battle of the Aisne, in May/June 1918. So it entered 3 years late, and 4 years before it did anything.

WW2 also went on for 4 years after the US joined. Whereas WW1 finished the next year. The USA played a very small active role in WW1.

Edit: and as I said before, by the time the USA entered and sent forces over to France the Germans had launched and failed at their last all out, all or nothing offensive.

Europe != France != Poland != UK != ... The only thing we really share is a common currency (excluding the UK). In general, we don't really feel united. Different languages, culture, heritage, religion, ...

&gt; Franco, Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, hundreds of years of imperial expansion &amp; blind nationalism. No offense but the entire reason we came to the United States was because we weren't nationalists. The entire reason we intervened in European affairs in the 1900s was because of nationalism. I'm not saying I disagree with you but I think it'd kind of a bullshit ethnocentric thing to say all things considered.

Each country has its blemishes. We (Belgians) had a king in the early 1900s who saw Congo as his personal property. More black people died during his reign than Jews during World War II. We like to pretend it never happened, but it did. Nothing we do can change that though, we can only try not to repeat our mistakes. So yes, when we see people waving flags (unless it's a sporting event) and shouting USA! USA!, some of us tend to get a little leery. While a bit of nationalism is encouraged, it can go to extremes rather quickly. And while you seem to have noticed how and where it went wrong in Europe, you don't seem to be learning from the mistakes we made.


&gt; The veracity of this observation will not be known for ten or twenty years. He was an incredibly influential leader and this death is very significant for American foreign policy. If you want to think less of Americans taking to the streets (I do) because of his death, that's fine, but lets not downplay the importance of it. Oh, and apparently being European has given you a license to ignore the common mans sense of closure. 2000 years of culture, a little light on the empathy.

He may still have been important to Americans, but I somewhat doubt the rest of the world felt the same way. If anything, you've killed a symbol, while fueling what he stood for. I was hoping his death would change your foreign policy (i.e., end the wars), but it won't. And therefore, it won't change the way how these countries feel about the US.  
Don't get me wrong, I think the world is better off without him. But no doubt in my mind, there are tons of people worldwide who feel the same way about Bush (and Obama). While 3000 people died on 9/11, many more lives were destroyed by your country.

&gt; I can't speak for the government but I imagine they thought it would be more symbolic to show the world how the United States military works. The world can mock and laugh at Americans, they can call us uncultured and uncouth, but at the end of the day our soldiers are very highly trained and they don't fuck around.

I don't think the symbolism is lost on us. You provide financial support to and encourage violent militants, but once the beast you helped create is out of its cage, it needs to die a swift death. No, you really don't fuck around.

&gt; I believe that the American contention that terrorism = military intervention is an axiom that pretty much everyone in the world understands.

If that were the case, Iraq would have never been invaded. How would you react if Iraq started bombing US cities because of the acts of terrorism the US has carried out in their country? Or does it stop being terrorism when your government backs it?

It's called ""the cost of doing business."" Don't like it? Too bad. That's how arguments from force work: If you don't like it then we'll shoot you in the face and then throw your body in the ocean. I'm not talking to you personally in this analogy but this is how the politics between nations work and I find it offensive that Europeans ""look down"" on Americans for continuing a practice that they perfected--and still perpetuate.

If all you're saying to me is that some researchers have argued that there was no historical Jesus then I'm not going to disagree with you. What my overarching point is is that this research goes largely ignored by most academics. If you had access to the ""Journal for the Study of the Historical Jesus"" then you'd be able to see how neglected the Jesus-Myth theory is in academia. Also, to be fair to the concept of scholarship, G.A. Wells is trained as a German historian (anyone who's studied history would know that modern and ancient history are two very different disciplines), and Ellegard was a professor of English, not an historian. While they present some interesting forms of arguments, their research has been heavily criticised.

Also, I never said that myth was 'factual', I said that it doesn't make sense to call it 'false'. Myth is not something that society grows out of, it's not something that can be opposed to 'rationality' or 'factuality'. Myth is pervasive. It permeates throughout all forms of discourse. I've heard many times in the social sciences a professor discuss the nature of myth in a book a play or a film. Even historians of the modern era are interested in the myth surrounding the Great Exhibition (1851), the palingenetic myths of nineteenth century European nationalism even the socio-cultural myths embedded in the scientific revolutions. Myth is not a way of saying that something is false, or even that it is not grounded in factuality, it's a way of suggesting that an event or phenomenon is a more complex cultural entity.

While there are myths which are, historically speaking, non-factual like the crossing of the sea of Reeds or Noah's Ark or the United Monarchy under King David/Solomon, there are also myths that are much more grounded (or are at least the mythical structures surrounding historical figures): Caesar Augustus being born in a miraculous manner and being the son of Apollo, Jesus being the Son of God, born of a virgin, etc. ",0,False,1427113703,t3_h0nrh,t5_2ryd5,True,DebateAChristian,0,t1_c1s4gvy,

scarthearmada,1,True,1304385315,c1s4iuy,,0,,1,t1_c1s3ald,"&gt;Power is the ability to enforce one's will, through whatever means. The more of that ability you have, the more power you have.

A libertarian would not accept that all power is coercive. A person may be able to enforce his or her will through force, or through persuasion. This is Alfred Whitehead speaking here: ""Now the intercourse between individuals and between social groups takes one of two forms, force or persuasion. Commerce is the great example of intercourse by way of persuasion. War slavery and governmental compulsion exemplify the reign of force."" Both could be said to concern *power*, but only one of them should be considered *bad*.

If my business becomes successful and I become more influential in the community because of that, then I have not coerced anyone. That we (the people in the community) are not equally as influential is irrelevant, if no one’s life is necessarily worse due to an act of coercion.

&gt;I don't claim to be ideology-free, however, I hope that my positions are well grounded in pragmatic observation. I think Soros's ideology is similar.

And yet those who disagree with your positions would argue that Hayek’s were also grounded in “pragmatic"" observation, if we’re to take “pragmatic observation” to refer to ""empirical observation."" If that's the case, Hayek could easily make the same claims as Soros -- and to a far greater extent: Hayek made a Nobel Prize winning economic career out of analyzing all sorts of social, political and economic data. Proponents of one form of socialism or another hardly have an exclusive claim over pragmatism.

&gt;With pure economic liberty, any positive feedback causes instability, and the system ends up with a concentration of economic power in a small number of hands. With pure economic liberty, that concentration of power can destroy (a) if, for example, a small cohort decide that only one social group can eat at the lunch counter,

My first order of business is to point out that “social liberty” is not the same as violating the property of others. Businesses are no different than private homes with regard to property rights: if I have the right to say who can and cannot enter my home, then I have the right to say who can and cannot enter my business. And this is exactly how “market fundamentalists” argue against this -- “freedom of association” is a different issue.

&gt;Concentration of economic power also destroys (b), in that those who are outside the concentration of economic power that is allowed by (b) find their economic choices restricted, so even if technically, (b) is complete, practically, it is not. The end result of too great an emphasis on (b) is eventually feudalism.

This is the first grave error committed. The notion that economic freedom (i.e., capitalism) leads to feudalism is laughable, in the grand scheme of history. It was the rise of capitalism that ultimately lead to the demise of feudalism. The fight against capitalism has always been the fight to maintain social order. Recall Marx arguing precisely what you’re saying, and recall how the most market-oriented countries cast off feudalism and the old order first, industrialized, and became the First world. The rise of capitalism didn’t just coincide with the demise of the feudal system: it has responsibility in its demise.

&gt;I can find examples of people who claim that their emphasis is on (b) who argue that they shouldn't be forced to support public education, for example, because it gives other people's children an equal chance at economic success as their own children (Dinesh D'Souza has made precisely that argument).

I’m not significantly familiar with Dinesh D’Souza. In fact, I had to Google who he is. But I have to ask for some sources here. That just seems silly.

&gt;Putting equality into the system as a value adds negative feedback, since it will rein in those concentrations of power that lead away from actual, empirical (b), rather than theoretical (b). Of course, genuine equality will never exist in the real world, since everyone has different abilities and backgrounds. But ensuring that at a minimum there is only an allowable range of inequality keeps a system meritocratic, and allows market forces to work as envisioned by Smith, instead of degenerating into a mass of oligopolies.

And now we’re getting to the powerful critique of your position, empirically speaking. Can you identify any coercive, or otherwise harmful monopolies or oligopolies that exist today or throughout history that have not come to being without the “assistance"" (to put it mildly) of government? That is the key, isn’t it? To your argument?

If a lack of government influence in the market means maximized economic liberty, and maximized economic liberty results in abolition of social liberty, then I would agree with you one-hundred percent. But have you researched and considered those historical examples where people existed for years, even centuries, in societies with the private ownership over the means of production and the distribution of wealth? Where are these harmful, wicked monopolies and oligopolies running around today that have such power because of a lack of government regulation and support?

And what of the modern corporation, no doubt an entity created by the state? Chartered by the state. Regulated by the state. Subsidized by the state. **Protected** from competition by the state. The great irony of it all being that two of our (American) most anti-capitalistic presidents, FDR and Wilson, were responsible for much of this legislation -- legislation that lead to conditions (oligopoly, for example) that end up being blamed on capitalism! 

(Some of the sources that I'll suggest later in my response hit upon this history, but the short of it is this: the intellectuals in the western world were becoming increasingly enamored by ""the third way"" of fascism on the European continent: a system that is neither communism nor capitalism. They were enamored by the Italian fascists in particular, and were profoundly impressed with Nazi Germany's economy, until war and the murder of so many Jews, gypsies and so on.

But before all of that, these intellectuals were increasingly influencing political thought in the western world: what if we could socialize the American economy in the most sustainable way possible? That is, socializing industry through a proxy, with the proxy being the *modern* corporation, and the system being known today as the corporate system.)

&gt;They also argue that enforcing (c) causes economic collapse, pointing at Communist systems as proof. But since Communism as we've seen it had neither (a), (b), nor (c), that's a weak argument.

The argument is a more sophisticated than that. More accurately, the argument is that in the quest for (c), violating (b) leads to a loss of (a) -- and that the more egregiously (b) is violated, the worse (a) gets. For the real world example, you can consider how the various reforms of the Soviet Union or the PRC, all in the name of equality and social justice, were tremendous examples of the violation of (c), resulting in the loss of tens of millions of lives through starvation and political suppression (i.e., murder).

&gt;I believe that the moves toward increased (a) and (c) from the New Deal and the reconstruction of Europe were a large part of the half-century of affluence the Western world has seen.

The New Deal was a miserable failure that extended the great depression. And, in fact, FDR’s own Treasury Secretary admitted exactly that: “We are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work. I say after eight years of this administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started.”

Even opponents of capitalism decried FDR and the New Deal as being hazardous failures. Consider Barton Bernstein’s words: “The liberal reforms of the New Deal did not transform the American system; they conserved and protected American corporate capitalism, occasionally by absorbing parts of threatening programs. There was no significant redistribution of power in American society, only limited recognition of other organized groups... The New Deal failed to solve the problem of depression, it failed to raise the impoverished, it failed to redistribute income, it failed to extend equality and generally countenanced racial discrimination and segregation.”

Have you ever read the article *New Deal Policies and the Persistence of the Great Depression: A General Equilibrium Analysis* by Cole and Ohanian, the two UCLA economics who concluded just a few years ago that the New Deal extended the great depression by seven years? (Google it. It’s available free online.) Read Higg's [Depression, War and Cold War])(http://mises.org/store/Depression-War-and-Cold-War-P334.aspx) and Flynn’s “[The Roosevelt Myth](http://www.amazon.com/Roosevelt-Myth-John-T-Flynn/dp/0930073274)” is a necessity. Or watch [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SNW0os5HpU) for a brief video-discussion of issues brought up in all of these documents. And as an ironic note since you seem so fond of Keynes and the New Deal: you should note that Keynes heavily criticized FDR for the New Deal’s regulations stifling business investment.

&gt;Soros didn't just say ""youse guys is wrong and I'm right, ya heah me?"" he laid out a reasoned critique of a central assumption of a particularly dominant economic ideology (and I call it an ideology because of its denial of empirical facts). Reisman, on the other had, said that Soros was wrong because he disagreed with Reisman.

For someone versed in Austrian economics, the article makes more sense to me.

This is not the HSBC Global Research Report titled ""*If the World is Warming, Why is it so Cold?*"" Said paper doesn't exist.

Regardless, here's the **full context of the Hansen quote-mine** (emph added)

&gt; Finally, a comment on frequently asked questions of the sort: Was global warming the cause of the 2010 heat wave in Moscow, the 2003 heat wave in Europe, the all-time record high temperatures reached in many Asian nations in 2010, the incredible Pakistan flood in 2010?  The 
standard scientist answer is ""you cannot blame a specific weather/climate event on global warming.""  That answer, to the public, translates as ""no"".
&gt; *However, if the question were posed as ""would these events have occurred if atmospheric carbon dioxide had remained at its pre-industrial level of 280 ppm?"", an appropriate answer in that case is ""almost certainly not.""  That answer, to the public, translates as ""yes"", i.e., humans probably bear a responsibility for the extreme event.*
&gt; In either case, the scientist usually goes on to say something about probabilities and how those are changing because of global warming.  But the extended discussion, to much of the public, is chatter.  The initial answer is all important.  
&gt; Although either answer can be defended as ""correct"", we suggest that leading with the standard caveat ""you cannot blame…"" is misleading and allows a misinterpretation about the danger of increasing extreme events. *Extreme events, by definition, are on the tail of the 6 probability distribution.  Events in the tail of the distribution are the ones that change most in frequency of occurrence as the distribution shifts due to global warming.*
&gt; For example, the ""hundred year flood"" was once something that you had better be aware of, but it was not very likely soon and you could get reasonably priced insurance.  But the probability distribution function does not need to shift very far for the 100-year event to be occurring several times a century, along with a good chance of at least one 500-year event.

Please tell me, though. If Turkey fully complies with the Copenhagen Criteria, thereby becoming indistinguishable from an European democracy (which is a condition for it's accession to begin with), why is it that Turkey does not belong within a union that, by definition, is a group of states very much like itself?

Please note, I'm not a proponent for Turkish accession. The most positive deed the EU can do Turkey, in my opinion, is transforming it into a fully functional European democracy, which is what it's already doing.

I do however believe it is somewhat odd to block out Turkey given it complies with the above. A Turkey in such a state cannot possibly be harmful to the dynamics and politics of the EU.

I don't know what historical context you are referring to, but if you are referring to our history of conflict, what is it that would set us different from Germany? A state that once dominated more than half of Europe, that killed, carried out unspeakable acts on European soil, and a state that stood against the Allies in both world wars.

Now, with that being said, let's not act as though these concepts are completely foreign to you guys. Your national anthem is 'God Save the Queen' so clearly god plays a part in your country's makeup, and aside from that, it's just one of those things said by all politicians because it's what they are expected to say. Just like the star athlete on the winning team never says 'Fuck yeah, I'm the best there is!' He says 'this was a team effort' and 'the other team played their hearts out' even if they didn't. And the queen and the crown are important to bring up. America has no queen, no crown. Instead, we use the flag and the Statue of Liberty as placeholders. Just like you put the queen on your money, we put the flag on our lapels. And although many people do own flags, it's not like there's a local flag store. Many are obtained through military service.

1) Reasonable minds can differ about the propriety of celebrating in the streets; I think you'd need to be a resident of this country to appreciate the significance of bin Laden's death. As other posters have said, it's a symbolic victory that represents much more than the termination of a man who is responsible for launching the largest attack to date on American soil. It brought some closure to the crummy decade following that event. We've had a pretty rough time during the past 10 years. This was an exciting sort of ""victory"" for our country--we needed some positive news. 

2) What curtailment of rights do you speak of? That phrase gets tossed around quite a bit by Americans...usually in the context of a frustrating experience at the airport. Not exactly a violation of basic civil rights. I am finishing up law school at the moment, so perhaps I am assigning too clinical a meaning to the term ""rights.""  

3) I'm not sure which Central European country you hail from. I have many Ukrainian, Slovakian, Bulgarian, Belarusian, and Romanian friends I've made over the years, who have been living here on J1 visas. From what I'm told, those countries have corruption from top to bottom--students purchasing their grades from professors, police officers accepting bribes to look the other way on robbery and assault, politicians poisoning one another (or themselves), etc. Post-Soviet central and eastern Europe house some of the most alarming corruption and rights violations in the world.

January 12 – A 7.0-magnitude earthquake occurs in Haiti, devastating the nation's capital, Port-au-Prince. With a confirmed death toll over 230,000[7][8][9] it is one of the deadliest on record.

February 18 – The President of Niger, Tandja Mamadou, is overthrown after a group of soldiers storms the presidential palace[13] and form a ruling junta, the Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy headed by chef d'escadron Salou Djibo.
February 27 – An 8.8-magnitude earthquake occurs in Chile, triggering a tsunami over the Pacific and killing 497.[15] The earthquake is one of the largest in recorded history.

March 26 – The ROKS Cheonan, a South Korean Navy ship carrying 104 personnel, sinks off the country's west coast, killing 46. In May, an independent investigation blames North Korea, which denies the allegations.

April 14 – Volcanic ash from one of several eruptions beneath Eyjafjallajökull, an ice cap in Iceland, begins to disrupt air traffic across northern and western Europe.
April 13 – A 6.9-magnitude earthquake occurs in Qinghai, China, killing at least 2,000 and injuring more than 10,000.
April 20 – The Deepwater Horizon oil platform explodes in the Gulf of Mexico, killing eleven workers. The resulting oil spill, one of the largest in history, spreads for several months, damaging the waters and the United States coastline, and prompting international debate and doubt about the practice and procedures of offshore drilling.

That said, while the south may have very well ""fired the first shots,"" the north committed the first Act of War by refusing to remove troops stationed in South Carolina after South Carolina had declared itself independent of the Union. 

In other words, while I disagree with the south on the morality of slavery, they were well within their legal rights to declare sovereignty and secede from the Union - a right which states still possess today. Buchanan wanted to maintain power and centralized control, and stationed an army in what was now technically a foreign country; i.e. he used violence to trespass against their rights (ironic, I know).

First I pointed out several times that I never labeled America as the people but rather the government.. Al though like any 'democratic' government it is only as good as the people that elect it. 

Because Joe Rogan is a comedian and UFC host makes him less creditable? People have a lot of extra activity. Joe has been an activist for a very long time and has spent countless hours researching about what it is he talks and jokes about..... If Carl Sagan presented the same pieces of evidence you would not think twice.... Like I said, that was not some made up bullshit.. IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. You can gain access to it through freedom of information act.. 

Lybia and Syria- 2 countries that have been armed 2 the teeth by America or its European allies... North Korea- Too broke to even have electricity. China- Industrial superpower that doesn't even have air craft carriers... Largest military in the world and how many countries do they occupy??? Right... Back to Syria... Where is the US now? Why is it the UN is dropping bombs in Libya but no Syria? Well let's take a look... United States used Syria as a detention and torture state post 9/11. Oil- It's declining in Syria and it's declining FAST. Turkey.. Turkey is too vital and stable to the middle east to be that close to a country with American or UN boots on the ground. 

Travel.. I have been a few places but don't didn't or won't change how I feel about any of this.. The world is indeed full of it's share of assholes but to say they are distributed equally is a little off the beaten path.... 

I just think you should really look into the war machine that America is and truly understand just what it is EXACTLY that your government is capable of. I said on here before on a different topic.. America makes GUNS!! Lots of em! For America to make money, they need to sell guns. In order to sell guns there needs to be war. In order for war, America needs to start it.... 

Now full circle back to the very beginning of all of this. OBL is dead. Shot and killed by a JSOC unit in Pakistan. Under order of the President of the United States. OBL was next to Hitler the most known mass murderer in the world. The man was responsible for 1000's of lives... Tens of thousands? Maybe, maybe not. 100s of thousands... NO... 
According to JustForeignPolicy.org Iraq has suffered almost 1.5 million total deaths since 2003.... So who is NOT the terrorist organization?? 

Look man. I get it.. You love your country. I love mine too. But I love the world more. I love the vast amounts of culture, diversity and sheer volume this earth has to offer. America loves America... It is what you are taught in your educational system, it is what your country has been founded upon. World history in America is about where America has been... I'm sorry, but until America learns to take care of itself at HOME and stop killing more people then any other country on the planet including Syria and North Korea who are amongst the worst human rights countries in the world.... Until then, I believe the American GOVERNMENT is a fully sanctioned and tax dollar paid terrorist organization....

According to the 2006 Census, Alberta is the fastest growing province in Canada . Its population increased by 10 .6% 
between 2001 and 2006, double the national growth rate (+5 .4%), accounting for over 3 million Albertans (Statistics 
Canada, 2008a) . In the first three months of 2008, Alberta’s population increased 0 .41%, even though inter-provincial 
migration declined in this period (Statistics Canada, 2008b) . The main source of population increase in the province was 
new immigrants and non-permanent residents . In the first quarter of 2008, 5,300 immigrants and 4,000 non-permanent 
residents came to Canada (Statistics Canada, 2008b) . Out of the total immigrants in Alberta,19 .7% were recent 
immigrants, (i .e . have been in the country for 5 years or less)

I still do not see how you define ""European"". I still do not see what ""the past"" has to do with the accession of an economic socio-political entity entering an economic socio-political union.

Still, when the past is concerned:

I'm assuming you use both a geographical AND a cultural criteria, otherwise you would object to Cypriot accession, and that is why Canada and Japan aren't eligible of accession (not to mention Japanese culture is not at all European).

On the other hand, genetically and culturally, the 2 million Turks that got to Anatolia got assimilated completely on the ethnic front. Culturally, they managed to impose their new found culture, the blend that resulted of Byzantine Anatolian and Central Asian Turkic cultures on their territories for centuries, yes. But as I pointed out, that culture is nowhere near the same today. If you compare Central Asian Turkic cultures, to the culture of Turkey today, the Turks are more European than they are Turkic. 

Religiously, yes they are 86% Muslim, but half of that 86% do not practice their religion, if religion mattered at all. For all religious purposes our religion is Secular.

If these factors mattered at all, it means the EU agreed with me, since Turkey is a candidate member.

Not that it matters, but just as easily you can denounce European Turkey as half assed, you can do the opposite. It is bigger than whole European countries (WOAH), it's home to the biggest European city, and the second biggest city in the world (WOW), it's population is again bigger than the population of some whole European countries (OOOH).

I do not think the Union agrees with you on what constitutes European identity. They seem to define themselves more on social terms rather than cultural, it is ludicrous to expect the whole of Europe to assimilate into a single European culture. 

They also seem to agree that if Turkey becomes European by their definition, what happened before is a bitter mistake of the past sure to not be repeated. When that assurance is there, why it matters is a mystery to me.

And so what violent occupation occurred before then? 

&gt;european and russian jews were coming and settling in the area, 

Oh, no! Jews moved into the neighborhood! Burn them out!

&gt;and there were arab attacks against this intrusion on their land. 

So you agree that we need to beat the shit out of some beaners, maybe string up a couple. That will stop that damned immigration stuff. And those damn Muslims are moving in. If we burn down a couple of Mosques they will know their place.

&gt;he openly incited arabs there (by claiming that the land belonged to the jews) and was actually arrested by the british for doing so

He claimed the land belong to the Jews? We all know that Jews are not allowed to own any land in Dar al Islam. What was that dhimmi thinking? It's like those uppity niggras, thinking they have the right to vote.

&gt;(illegal because the british weren't allowing it)

Illegal because the Arabs were rioting and killing to stop the Jews. And you still have not given any justification for the Arab violence. But you have given justification for Jews defending themselves.

&gt;but europeans and russians who just happen to jewish have no right to claim self-determination 

Exactly, fuck them and let them die. Just as I am sure you think that the Darfuris should not be going to Chad, they should just die in place. Just like it is wrong for Iraqis to have left Iraq and wrong for Afghanis to have left Afghanistan. They should just stay and die. (I think of that as sarcastic, but you probably don't give a damn about those people.)

Second, empire-building doesn't have to be blatant, like European imperialism was. We Americans were far more effective hegemonialists than, for instance, the British or the French were, we built a ""soft empire"", a ""stealth empire"", an empire of consent, an empire without jannissaries, colonial forces, and foreign legions. And, it can be argued, that we did more than financially break even with our soft empire building efforts, unlike the European imperialists, who impoverished themselves in their imperial games.

&gt;The only problem with that is open aggression in the age of nuclear weaponry is a bit tricky. 

Look at Pakistan. Pakistan has nuclear weapons. Is Pakistan really a completely sovereign nation, in charge of its internal affairs and external relations? I hardly think so. It is a nation of limited and contingent sovereignty. Not saying Pakistan couldn't use a little foreign intervention - look at the sorts of rats that have been found hiding in Pakistani rat holes next to the Pakistani military academy. After recent developments, I don't see how anyone can regard the ISI as anything but the ""uniformed branch"" of al Qaeda.

&gt;But the Chinese lack something that the US has that is needed for such operations: a blue water navy.

As for blue-water navies: I don't think you need a blue-water navy to create a non-coercive hegemony these days. It helps, but it isn't essential. All you need is the lack of an enemy willing to go after you, along with massive foreign exchange reserves. In any event, with the US not possessing a viable large-scale commercial ship-building sector, but rather a military ship-building sector that exists only due to government life support, the Chinese can easily outproduce us in building large numbers of naval vessels, as they have shipyards that actually are competitive, agile, private sector institutions...so US blue-water naval dominance is not assured forever.

I doubt the Chinese would go for a ""hard empire"" anyway, they are more subtle and conniving than one gives them credit for, and hard empires often cost more than they benefit the imperial power. The Chinese appear to me to be building a ""soft empire"" out of the pieces of the world that perceive the US as either mistreating them (South America) or ignoring them (Sub-Saharan Africa). I don't think they will seek direct military conflict with the US - at least, not until the US is a lot weaker than it presently is - as the outcome would be uncertain. However, I think that US friendships and eventual alliances with Taiwan, Korea, Japan, India, Vietnam, the Central Asian republics and Russia, along with Mongolia are not so subtle hints that the US strategy for China is one of encirclement, and all are potential flashpoints that could widen into a US - Chinese war.

the ottomans were in occupation and the arabs violently resisted against them as well

&gt;Oh, no! Jews moved into the neighborhood! Burn them out!

not just any jews (there were of course many indigenous jews from the area) it was european and russian colonizers that were the problem

&gt;So you agree that we need to beat the shit out of some beaners, maybe string up a couple. That will stop that damned immigration stuff. And those damn Muslims are moving in. If we burn down a couple of Mosques they will know their place.

when mexicans start coming to the US and establishing mexican only settlements and claiming that US land is theirs, i'll be the first one to say they should be sent back to mexico

&gt;He claimed the land belong to the Jews? We all know that Jews are not allowed to own any land in Dar al Islam. What was that dhimmi thinking? It's like those uppity niggras, thinking they have the right to vote.

""he"" is a ukranian who happens to be a jew.  not sure why you think it's ok for him to claim that land in the middle east belongs to him.

&gt;Illegal because the Arabs were rioting and killing to stop the Jews. And you still have not given any justification for the Arab violence. But you have given justification for Jews defending themselves.

actually no.  the british at that time had not agreed to allow jews from europe and russia to establish a country in the mandate.  in fact they passed a law which specifically banned european jews from immigrating there.  the balfour declaration was passed in 1917, but clarified by the Churchill white paper in 1919.

&gt;Exactly, fuck them and let them die. Just as I am sure you think that the Darfuris should not be going to Chad, they should just die in place. Just like it is wrong for Iraqis to have left Iraq and wrong for Afghanis to have left Afghanistan. They should just stay and die. (I think of that as sarcastic, but you probably don't give a damn about those people.)

thanks for cutting off my statement to make your point.  i didn't say european and russian jews have no right to self-determination.  i said they have no right to self-determination in land that doesn't belong to them.  as an american, i have no right to self-determination in indonesia.  that's not how it works.  the full legal term is ""self-determination of non-self-governing peoples (colonized and/or indigenous)"" that should give you a clue

&gt; No, actually, they don't. That was a stated yet again with the reconciliation.

you just misunderstand what hamas is saying.  they don't recognize israel in its current form.  if israel would agree to the 1967 borders, hamas has said years ago that they would accept this.

1: This is a given. Any sufficiently large military operation conducted by an aggressor will provoke a response in kind. 

2: This they tried and failed at. They were predicting a large-scale popular uprising against the US. What they got were sectarian struggles in Iraq that petered out and opportunistic half-hearted resistance in Afghanistan. They projected their identity and fervor on to the populations of Iraq and Afghanistan and failed to take into account the relatively pro-western (not government but society) and surprisingly secular sentiments of the iraqis and the war weariness of the afghans, who value stability and safety over ideology. A recent poll by the Asia Foundation determined that the number of afghans who think the country is heading in the right direction has increased every year since 2006 and the vast majority believe that they are better off now than in any year since 2004 (the first year of the poll). 

3: This failed to happen. In the west we may associate our retarded decision to invade Iraq as fulfilling this but what al Qaeda was hoping for was war stretching from palestine through Saudi Arabia and on to Pakistan. Now we are withdrawing from Iraq and besides limited actions in Pakistan and Libya, which do not come close to what they were expecting, we actually have better relations with most Arab countries now than we did in 2001. 

4: The franchising happened-- for about four years. Then it petered out. Why? Because killing 20 people in a European train station bombing has absolutely nothing to do with US foreign policy decisions and they're  too occupied avoiding predator drone strikes to plan large-scale operations anymore. They assumed that like after the Beirut bombings and mogadishu we would cut and run when faced with more violence. This assumed an inherent weakness in western character that was based on their sense of righteous superiority that has no basis in fact. 

5: Ah number 5. This is what most westerners will click their teeth at. But cable news bloviators aside, western society is in no danger of economic collapse, and the sub-prime mortgage meltdown had absolutely nothing to do with our military spending. As a comparison, our debt after WW2 and the Korean War makes our current debt level look positively solvent. A popular myth in the Arab world was that the ""brave, virtuous, Islamic martyrs of Afghanistan"" single-handedly brought down the soviet union. But they didn't. Decades of bungled central planning, low (possibly artificially low due to meddling by the US) oil and gas prices, and internal political dissent after decades of repression were what did the soviets in--  not Timmy the terrible Taliban. Just for reference, the nine year invasion of Afghanistan killed .005% of the population the USSR. (15000 deaths out of 286000000 citizens) Hardly a crippling blow, and nothing compared to WWII.

I don't know how they did it, but I'm not even sure its really a coincidence that the name of America's supposed number one enemy for many years is only one letter away from the name of our president.  I think maybe they set it up that way on purpose just to fuck with conservatives and divide the population.

Afghanistan was supposed to be about Bin Laden as much as anything.  You know what it is actually about, aside from territory and fossil fuels?  Heroin.  The Taliban actually eradicated the opium crops, so we went directly over there and turned the entire country into a giant opium plantation at the point of our soldier's weapons.  The Afghans are our slaves.  Its not that they only want to grow opium because its the only way to make money.  They _can't_ grow other crops, because they know if they try, our soldiers will shoot them.

Relative to other parts of the world, Afghanistan isn't all that far from India.  Look at the history of the British in India.  Anyone ever heard of something called the Opium Wars?  Coincidentally, the majority of Americans are of British descent.

&gt;_Sea of Poppies is a historical novel. Is it the fact that the British were the world's biggest opium suppliers two centuries ago that led you into this story?_

&gt; I should correct you. It was not two centuries ago. Under the British Raj, an enormous amount of opium was being exported out of India until the 1920s.

&gt;_When and how did you end up researching and learning more about the British opium trade out of India?_
I was looking into it as I began writing the book about five years ago. Like most Indians, I had very little idea about opium.

&gt; I had no idea that India was the largest opium exporter for centuries. I had no idea that opium was essentially the commodity which financed the British Raj in India.

May, 2001

&gt; The American findings confirm earlier reports from the United Nations drug control program that Afghanistan, which supplied about three-quarters of the world's opium and most of the heroin reaching Europe, had ended poppy planting in one season.

http://publicintelligence.net/usnato-troops-patrolling-opium-poppy-fields-in-afghanistan/

https://publicintelligence.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/USopium6.png

&gt; Many of the photos do not mention anything related to destruction or removal of poppies.  Instead, they describe how troops “patrol” through and around the fields. In one instance, a US soldier even seems to be even helping with cultivation... November 2009, the Afghan Minister of Counter Narcotics General Khodaidad Khodaidad stated that the majority of drugs are stockpiled in two provinces controlled by troops from the US, the UK, and Canada. He also said that NATO forces are taxing the production of opium in the regions under their control and that foreign troops are earning money from drug production in Afghanistan.

[US Department of State, Question Taken at Daily Press Briefing on July 13, 2009](http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2009/july/126044.htm)

&gt;_Question: What is our reaction to the recent release of five drug lords in Afghanistan?_

&gt;Answer: We note that the Government of Afghanistan has scored some notable successes in arresting, successfully prosecuting, and sentencing known narco-traffickers. 

&gt;The U.S. has aided Afghanistan in these efforts. The Department of State, through the U.S. Department of Justice, has contributed approximately $6 million to the development of the Criminal Justice Task Force. Established in May 2005, this joint task force is responsible for investigating and bringing cases against mid- and high-level traffickers.

&gt;It is disappointing however, when successfully-prosecuted traffickers are later released, as has occurred recently. This undermines the work of the Afghan Ministries of the Interior and Counter Narcotics.

If it was 4,500 metric tons per year in 1999, last few years it is probably way more than 6,000 metric tons.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_production_in_Afghanistan

According to this http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/region_central_southern_az/yuma/agents-recover-22-pounds-of-black-tar-heroin 22 lbs. of black tar heroin has a street value of 1.7 million.  Thats 10 kg.  So assuming that opium converts to a similar weight, thats $170,000 per kg.  6000 metric tons = (6000 x 1000) kg * $170000 = $1 020 000 000 000 per year or $19 billion per week.

Which means if the war costs $2 billion per week, there is a potential profit of $17 billion per week.  Or if I am way off the mark and the opium is worth say, half, thats only a potential war profit from drug sales of around $8 billion per week.

There is no capitalist class and wage laborers such as myself don't submit to anything. Every socialist should consult the dictionary because your hyperbolic use of words is very annoying. Your assignment: look up what ""class"" and ""submit"" mean in actual English instead of Marxian drivel.

&gt; Private property is ultimately violent control over matter, space and energy.

Cling to it, it's not true. If you want to break it down to the physical level, private property is much more about the specific configuration of matter, space and energy. Should you find yourself alone in wild nature someday you might appreciate what a difference it makes when a lot of people arange all this matter just so that they'll profit most from it i.e. are most useful to their fellow men. And I notice how you have never even addressed the obvious problem of that exclusitivity is required if you actually want to do anything worthwhile with it. How is common property supposed to work when Paul want's to make a field but once he cut all the trees down Peter comes alone ""Paul you capitalist pig, you can not violently control space and matter. I want to build a holiday spa for my comrads and I here and I will do so now"". Only then Bill comes alone when the spa is half build and insists it become a lumber mill. How exactly are such problems solved in socialism? Oh wait I know! After the revolution we won't be so touchy feely about those imagined things ""rights"" and we'll simply shoot anyone as a counter revolutionary who doesn't bow to what the central planning commitee decided.

The fact that no state has ""implemented"" (you don't need to implement the natural order among non-violent humans) capitalism only shows that state apologists have pulled the lever so far towards ""top down domination"" that most people have become unable to contemplate spontenous, emergent order.

&gt; The fact that quality of life rapidly decreases the more capitalist a society becomes is a testament to its malignant nature

That's a joke, right? Seriously, inform yourself. Please, you are embarrasing even your fellow Marxists. Even Marx did not doubt the productive capability of capitalism and even he knew it was better then mercantilism or feudalism that came before.

&gt; The only country to have tried flirting with pure capitalism, the US, virtually collapsed economically because of it.

Again, that you use the US which acts with absolute discordance from every capitalist principle as an example  shows again your absolute bottomless ignorance. You simply can not be serious. Every single industry in the US is muddled by political ties, subsidies, patents, and/or regulatory capture. The banking system is basically state run. Wonder if Bernancke will finally realize the socialist's dream of negative intrest. Wallstreet, well let's say the capital markets aren't what they are supposed to be either when they can simply depend on billion dollar bailouts. Then there are tarrifs and tax breaks that ""incentivize"" industry and individuals in every which way but mostly harmful (such as linking health insurance to employment or putting your pension savings completely into the stock market). Let's not even talk about the ridiculously bloated war machine and the pointless, wastful and expensive wars it leads. The US a capitalist country? That's what peasants are made to believe, strangely both by the US and her enemies.

&gt; And in case you haven't noticed this is the 21st century

There are *vast* swaths of land with ever resource imaginable unclaimed in Asia, Canada, Africa and Australia as well as Easter Europe and South America. Yes, you need tools and wood and everything else your fellow men can provide but again you only see your need, make it the primary nexus of your understanding and conclude that they are hogging it. Let me tell you again the ugly truth of the matter: without the peaceful cooperation of your fellow men you and I would perish in untouched nature because these means to sustain life and the resources you harp on about don't just lie around in big piles. They might as well be on the moon. And once a greedy fat capitalist goes to the moon to bring back resources you will again claim your freedom to be violated because the capitalst didn't see fit to provide you access to your ""birth right"" no matter how utopian it is for you to reach the moon yourself.

Your ""philosophy"" is solely based on a child-like sense of entitlement (which you, besmirching that fine word, call 'liberty') and in order to make it fit you delude yourself greatly as to the nature of this world, the structure of society and our economic history to make at least a sliver of sense out of it all.

There's some truth to this, but I don't think that this applies to all modern medicine. Things like birth defects, disabilities, etc are not just by products of civilization. They can be of course. There's no shortage of evidence for that. But natural immunities will only take us so far. You mentioned the European arrival in the New World and the disease it brought. Yes, some indigenous people were able to adapt and survive, but why should the vast majority have to die without being aided? I'm sorry to say this, but I can't view this as anything but Social Darwinism. 

&gt; To cause most species of animals to go extinct (and possibly us included) so we can have a feel-good fest about vegetarianism rather than accepting our place in the ecosystem is pure insanity.

I only mention this because some anarcho-primitivists I have met are also strongly in favor of meat abolition. Not necessarily you or anyone on r/anarchism, it's just something I have noticed. I think the two points are incompatible. 

&gt; what prevents humans in a post-collapse environment from creating, learning, finding new forms of expression, and exploring?

Nothing at all. As I said in my comment, these things all existed before civilization too. My point might not have been clear here. What I meant is that there is tremendous value in the exploration and expression that has been done before, in sharing these things across time and culture. Which brings up the next point...

&gt; humans not only had oral histories before books

Absolutely, and oral histories were must more detailed that we could hope for today. But you simply can't compare to the amount of knowledge we have today. The human mind is incredible for the knowledge it can hold, but without other means to store, transmit, and teach, you'll lose the vast majority of it. Even if the mind had the capacity to store everything, there's not enough time in an average lifetime to learn it all. Maybe most of it is useless to a post-civilization world. Let's consider medicine again. Without having access to the wealth of data available on human biology, we're less equipped to deal with changes in our environment. The earth is not a stable environment. Mass extinctions existed before human beings evolved. That's not to say that human beings are not capable to making things worse. We absolutely are and that needs to be addressed immediately.

&gt; I apologize for being so aggressive, but your worldview is incoherent and incredibly shortsighted.

Look, I'm not trying to start fights with people here. You're entitled to your opinion and I'd like to discuss these things civilly. All of these responses contain some extremely important points.

I know. You are a very respectful and informed commenter and are not petty like others on here. I appreciate that.

&gt;an empire of consent

You just changed topics on me. Your points are all valid, but above you said ""where China uses its military might to bludgeon countries into buying their goods"". I agree that China could try to build a more soft, mutually beneficial type empire, especially with Latin America and Africa.

And further, I don't really think the US during its peak imperial period (circa 1900) was much of a soft empire. We invaded numerous places for fun and profit (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_is_a_racket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_is_a_racket) and are definitely not a country that I would characterize as having foreign policy in which the counterparties give consent in all cases. This extends all of the way to the present (Vietnam, Carter Doctrine, Panama, Iraq). Granted, it wasn't quite as extreme as Britain or France in terms of annexing the spoils (although we did do that too with Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Phillipines). The US has done the soft approach at times as well (which was made easier thanks to the threat of the Soviets), but do not discount our long history of intervention for economic reasons. We have done this ever since the westward expansion period completed (and the westward expansion period itself can and should be characterized as traditional empire building).


&gt;Look at Pakistan. Pakistan has nuclear weapons

Pakistan lacks long range missiles, missile subs, and the H-bomb, so they are only a regional threat. And, as we all know, they are a disorganized clusterfuck of a country.

But this is also not really related to what I'm talking about. I'm discussing openly invading other countries in the old pre-WWII style to build empires, which is what nuclear weaponry has largely stopped (except in Africa, but sadly no one really cares about them). Only the US (Vietnam, Iraq) and Russia (Afghanistan and numerous proxy wars) have really done this since 45 (although Israel, UK, and France have done a bit as well, and with US approval except for Suez).

&gt;I don't see how anyone can regard the ISI as anything but the ""uniformed branch"" of al Qaeda.

This is getting a bit out of range of the original conversation. I agree to a degree. The ISI seems to be a rather complex organization itself with elements that are pro-western and elements that are pro-islamist. Overall, I am extremely pissed off at Pakistan right now though. I thought Bin Laden was hiding in the Tribal regions, not in a fucking rich suburb near the capital. If the Pakistanis are upset about the US ""invading their sovereignty"" with this operation, then they should take into account that they were housing the world's most wanted criminal in an area that they supposedly have control over.


&gt;As for blue-water navies: I don't think you need a blue-water navy to create a non-coercive hegemony these days.

Of course not. Soft power is based off of the ability to use economic leverage and diplomacy. China has lots of economic leverage. On the diplomacy side, they still have a long ways to go to catch up with the west though.

&gt;so US blue-water naval dominance is not assured forever.

Nothing is assured forever. Military power is essentially a moving average of economic power. The US needs to get its economic shit together if we want to stay powerful militarily in the long run. And we need to do that anyways to keep our country progressing along.

Also, I wouldn't say that China's ship building (or any industry for that matter) aren't supported by the government. They have an enormously protectionist system in both the macro (currency) and micro (subsides) sense. Further, if we really entered a new Cold War period, the US has demonstrated in the past that it can quickly ramp up production to do whatever is needed. Our production capacity is vastly underutilized right now. Our economy was mostly idle for 12 years before WWII started and we started massively producing things overnight. Of course, letting the capacity stay idle for too long will rot it away. But really, this doesn't matter that much due to nuclear weapons (WW3 will likely be over in 30 minutes or less). 

And another note is that I think we are on the verge of major breakthroughs in robotics and other technologies (e.g. nanotech) that will make the need for traditional workers in factories much less important. In 50 years, I see the physical production side of the economy largely automated. And the US is in an excellent position to build its economy around such technology. It still has some of the best natural resources in the world and is furthest along in most areas of science and engineering (which are the key ingredients of such an economy). Now if only we could built LFTR, we'd have the energy to do all of this. :P

&gt;I don't think they will seek direct military conflict with the US - at least, not until the US is a lot weaker than it presently is - as the outcome would be uncertain. 

Honestly, unless technology changes drastically (e.g. reliable missile defense systems against ICBMs), I don't see the US and China going to war ever. If tensions do rise, then MAD should hold just like it did with the USSR. Unless a madman takes the helm of either side, then these countries aren't interested in suicide. If a conflict occurs, it will be more of a Cold War style conflict of influence and economic performance (one could argue that the Chinese already has this attitude while the US is pretending there is no such conflict). In the worst case, there could be some proxy wars, but I doubt it will go that far because the Chinese don't want to ruin business relationships with the US and Europe.

&gt;However, I think that US friendships and eventual alliances with Taiwan, Korea, Japan, India, Vietnam, the Central Asian republics and Russia, along with Mongolia are not so subtle hints that the US strategy for China is one of encirclement

We did the same thing with the USSR. If the US manages to make extremely strong ties with India and Russia while maintaining its current ties, then I think it will remain influential for the foreseeable future. Remember, most of the world's military power lies in the US and Russia (95% of the nuclear weapons, largest Navys/Air Forces, and most advanced space tech). And Russia and India are BRICs just like China, so they have a lot of room to grow (and both markets are largely devoid of US commercial products at the moment as well, which is an enormous business opportunity). 

Switching topics slightly, besides the ""encirclement strategy"", the thing the Chinese are really missing at the moment is commercial branding. The US, Japan, South Korea, and Europe have mastered this. This is one of the key ways that US and Europe have been able to dominate the last century. At one point (and maybe still now) everyone in the world wanted access to Coca-Cola, Nike, and McDonalds. I can name hundreds or maybe even thousands of brands from these countries, but what the hell is sold out of China, Brazil, or Russia? Out of those three countries, I can only name Petrobras, Lenovo, and Kaspersky off the top of my head. Maybe this is irrelevant, but every first world country has been very successful in this area and the Chinese have made very little headway into this area for being the world's second largest economy. They still seem to be like the pre-1960s USSR, with a concentration on heavy industry and infrastructure at the expense of consumer products (unless it is being produced for foreigners) and the service sector.

&gt;and all are potential flashpoints that could widen into a US - Chinese war.

Once again, I don't see this happening. Taiwan is the most likely place, but as I said above, no one is suicidal literally or economically.

&gt;I think that there is one circumstance in which the Communist regime stands a chance of collapsing. That is an economic stumble. If China's growth is based on a bubble, and the CCP isn't able to keep growth going, well, all bets are off, and the present regime may well lose the ""mandate of heaven"".

I think it is inevitable that the growth won't last forever. All major economies have stumbled at one point or another. The growth will come back, but it can create huge periods of unrest that can drastically change societies (e.g. 1870s and 1930s). I don't know if it will be bad enough to make the Chinese population stand up and do something about it though. Personally, I see a slow evolution towards more personal freedoms in China (unless an economic crisis speeds it up). This becomes possible as the per capita GDP rises and there are more resources to go around (and oppression becomes less necessary if the population is rich enough to have little to be angry about). Even if they don't maintain 10% GDP growth forever (which they obviously won't), they can get up to western living standards over time.

Meta-game is the term used to indicate general trends of the strategies people are incorporating. Like fashion, certain play styles can be en vogue at different times and at different regions.  These styles often are more or less permissive of other styles.

For instance, zerg versus zerg openings (note: this example may not represent the current meta-game). In Europe, early aggression and all-in strategies may not be as common so you can get away with the heavy economic play.  However, in North America, early aggression and all-ins are the norm and so early eco play will lose you the game.  So someone might say something like ""16 hatch won't work on the NA server because everyone 9 pools""  (translation: early economy play won't work because they'll kill you with an aggressive opening), and ""14 gas, 14 pool won't work on European server won't work because everyone 16 hatches"" (translation: a very safe opening will be punished because it won't be aggressive soon enough to take advantage of the economic opening and the economic player is now very far ahead.""",0,False,1427114744,t3_h29u6,t5_2qh03,True,gaming,0,t1_c1s6od9,

I'm not very sure, last time I studied history was a long time ago. But from what I remember, post WWI europe was not that keen on war anytime soon.

The ""War to end all wars"" cliché was pure propaganda. Britain was involved in conflicts from the second the war ended- we never stopped being an imperial power, after all.

* first off he will have this summer off to recover (unlike last season cos of WC) and no doubt have twice the season he has had this year
* secondly, although we have potential replacements for him already none are quite ready to step up yet (Ramsey just back from injury, jack has only just done his first season, and Nasri only excelled in the first half of this season before flagging).

So violence against the Jews was justified because of the Ottoman occupation. Got it.

So it is the Jews who would not be dhimmi that were the problem. And if you call them colonizers it makes it easier to hate and kill them. If you call them refugees it does not look quite as good. Of course it is odd for colonizers to not have a country (this is the only known example) and odd for colonizers to buy the land at normal commercial rates.

&gt;you just misunderstand what hamas is saying. they don't recognize israel in its current form. if israel would agree to the 1967 borders, hamas has said years ago that they would accept this.

And for each of those I can find later quotes making it clear that all of Israel is occupied. Why do you pretend otherwise. The 67 borders are the basis of negotiation. It does not make sense for Hamas to refuse to negotiate if they would accept those borders.

For starters, they don't hate just ""Americans"". They hate all westerners as is proven by their attacks around Europe, the UK and Russia. More specifically though, they hate western culture and influence. They like to use other words for that, they call it ""imperialism"". Part of that does include ""our freedoms"" though. They don't *want* women to be equal for example, they want to keep the status quo and westernization is the biggest threat to that. 

Another reason why they hate ""us""*, would be because of globalization. Not just economic globalization, but social and cultural globalization. The exchange of ideas and information all play a key role and is a threat to their way of life or status quo they've had for hundreds of years.

To conclude - Yes, they hate ""us""* for imperialism but it's much, much more than that. That's only the tip of the iceberg.

1. Europe had much faster innovation in weapon technology and armament. Mail and plate armor required different kind of sword than leather armour. Eventually battle axe that works as can opener and caused blunt trauma was the best weapon against good armor. Jesuits did give parts of European plate armor as gifts to high ranking samurai and they provided superior protection in the battle against samurai sword. 
2. Most swords used in battle were melted when sword fighting ended in Europe. Big number of  clumsy ceremonial or decorative swords were saved in visible places. They were not made for battle. They were heavy and unbalanced, giving European swords bad reputation. 
2. Europe has lots of iron. Every village blacksmith could build some kind of  sword when need arose. There was lots of low quality swords available. Iron was very expensive in Japan. Swords were very expensive and every sword was high quality.

I had my jaws wired shut for 6 weeks. The key to blending your food so that it's edible and still tasty is your mix of starch and liquid. You ALWAYS need a starch/liquid base. Don't throw a piece of lasagna in a blender without some chicken broth in there first. If you have a good starch/liquid base, you can blend almost anything savory in it and it will be tasty.

For Asian and Latin foods, use a rice porridge base. Make rice with a 10:1 liquid to rice ratio, stirring it often. Yeah, that seems like a lot, but you need the rice super mushy in order for it to blend well.

For American/European foods, cook egg noodles in broth until they practically fall apart when you pick it up with a fork.

Once you have a good based, you can blend almost anything into it. 

Chicken and fish blend really well. Beef is a little bit more difficult. Pork is good if it's pull-apart tender.

On the fly, blending Campbell's condensed soups in a blender actually turns out really well. Mixed the condensed soup and water in the blender, and then microwave or heat it up on the stove as usual.

If you want fruit or something sweet, stay away from anything with seeds or chocolate chips. They will not blend and will not get past the wires and teeth. I once ordered a smoothie with raspberries and strawberries and I had to rinse my mouth out every 3 sips, because the seeds couldn't get through my clenched jaw filter system.

On a side note, keep in mind that after you have the wires taken off, you'll have to bring your dental A-game afterwards. After not brushing 70% of your teeth's surface area, your teeth will be really susceptible to cavities afterwards. Use mouth wash whenever you can, but remember you won't be able to spit anything when you're jaws are wired. You'll just have to let everything leak out from behind your teeth.

The thing is that people from France, England and the rest of Europe do not experience these adverse effects. It simply *doesn't happen*. For them it is a heinous sin, even, to pasteurise cheese. 

But further to this - you mentioned imported cheese - but that wouldn't be the point. The point would be to make our own - our dairy farmers are under the pump as it is, afterall. Currently, France pretty much has the market on delicious soft cheeses cornered - but that doesn't need to be the case. Consider that they held the primo wine market for years - but now South Australia can arguably make a wine which is just as great but without the mystic of being French. It's made us millions importing it around the world.

On the first one, why not try a little reductio ad absurdum? If Congress could NOT regulate commerce between states, what then? Do the states regulate themselves? How does Congress know which of each state's exports are interstate exports and which are leaving the country? Would the union not then fall apart as everyone starts taking contol of their own situation and demanding autonomy? It would end up looking more like the European Union than the USA. 

On the other hand, maybe at the time the states were pushing back a bit against Congress, and thought it made more sense for them to do it. After all, having central government stick its nose into your business is ... well, their business!

On the second one, apart from the fact that that guy Milligan looks pretty scary stary, I guess that if you let the military courts take over, you might argue that there's no point in retaining the civil courts at the same time. Or rather, you need to have some kind of precedence, or you'll end up with two judges slugging it out for the right to preside. And it's pretty unfair to get subject to a death penalty just because there's a military judge in town.

* Identify heroes that you find are useful against a lot of lineups (and that you like playing) and practice those. E.g. Witch Slayer is useful in pretty much any lane, his stun + morph make him a fairly forgiving hero to play and keeps him useful into the late game even if you've not had a great match (xp/gp gain). Just don't use his ult to finish off low hp targets ;) 

* While it's a good idea to do as you do and just randomly play a lot of the heroes to begin with in NoStats to get a working knowledge of all the skills and playstyles I'd recommend you focus on a smaller set of heroes if you want to play more seriously and increase your skill. I find that people who've played 5 heroes 20 times each are a lot better than people who've played every hero 3 times.
* Always make sure the team have wards. If you're support buy them over other items, if you're not remind your supporting players to keep buying them through the game, and if they fail to in most cases I'd start buying some myself, especially if I play a ganking hero or a lane farmer and I need to have vision of incoming ganks. 
* Like already mentioned, buy homecomingstones. Running into the trees and porting out will often save your life when a gank comes for you. In cases your attackers wont have stuns and you can even port out while they're beating on you if you time it right.
* Sometimes you fuck up and get behind so much that a lane becomes un-winnable. Sometimes it's one or more teammates who fuck up. A lot of people will scream and shout to deflect blame away from themselves, just block it out and see if playing more defensively/cautiously will keep you with a chance. If not just concede the game. Checking out the replays for games like these can be interesting to find out what went wrong - even if the conclusion is simply that the other team was simply better than yours.
* Similarly, a lot of people are very selfish and will only play mid or carry heroes, so at times you might end up in matches where 3 people have picked solo mid heroes or hard carries that need to farm for 50 minutes to be useful. If a game goes tits up from the start like this and you end up as say 2 melee heroes in your lane against 2 ranged just play defensively and try not to die a lot.
