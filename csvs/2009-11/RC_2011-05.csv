**wrong approach.**

you need to choose your destinations wisely. rome and the rest of europe are an awful choice if you're traveling on a budget. why? the euro is slaughtering the dollar, this drives up the price to go to and be in europe (which is also why gas prices are rising, dollar is inflating = oil is priced in dollars = oil drives up cost of flights, anyway...).

want to travel outside of the country? birmingham alabama to cancun is $327. puerto rico is $428. jamaica is $453.

want to stay in the USA? birmingham alabama to miami florida is $237. denver colorado is $239. new york city is $255.

these tickets are on kayak. go to kayak.com/buzz or kayak.com/explore and see for yourself.

here's how you save up to travel if you're tight: create a new bill every month, it's called the travel fund. pay $100 a month into it, don't fuck off, take it seriously and treat it like a car payment or necessary service bill. at the end of the year, you'll have $1200. you can stay in hostels for $15/night around cancun, and eat at taco stands for $2-4 a meal. even if you lived 'well' for a budget traveler, you'd be spending about $35/day which is enough to stay a full month traveling around the east coast of mexico. yea, you might not have all the amenities of the first world, but who gives a shit, [this is your scenery so i think you can deal with a few salty showers](http://i.imgur.com/Qotkn.jpg).

if you still think traveling is expensive, you're just looking for an excuse to not go anywhere.

They had been the Communist Revolutionaries, who had peacefully made the decision to endorse a Communist government.

&gt;Understand that the land borders between Russia Poland and Germany were only loosely policed, except in time of war, thus political ideals crossed rivers and mountains, so did the Zionists, thus a Yiddish speaking Khazar was equally at home in Poland as in Germany or Russia.

So reading below, Plocker has identified Jews as the most part of the terror in Russia, surely their influence extended as far as Germany. Who funded and planned the vast Nuremburg type rallies held throughout Germany as the Nazis came to power, the whole world was in the grip of a depression so where did the money for the uniforms, and the flags come from.

Jews established and staffed the Secret Police forces who took advantage of the upheavals of the 1917 Russian revolution, who used draconian laws similar to modern US anti terror legislation, that enabled arrests without trial and indefinite detention on anyone they wanted, that caused the millions of deaths blamed on Stalin, Trotsky and Lenin.

**Sever Plocker @ Ynet News**

&gt;The Jews were responsible for both Hitler’s and Stalin’s excesses .. Some of the worst mass murderers in history were Jews …20th of December 1917, in the midst of the Bolshevik revolution and civil war, Lenin signed a decree calling for the establishment of The All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage, also known as Cheka. 

&gt;Within a short period of time, Cheka became the largest and cruelest state security organization. Its organizational structure was changed every few years, as were its names: From Cheka to GPU, later to NKVD, and later to KGB.

&gt;We cannot know with certainty the number of deaths Cheka was responsible for in its various manifestations, but the number is surely at least 20 million, including victims of the forced collectivization, the hunger, large purges, expulsions, banishments, executions, and mass death at Gulags.

&gt;Whole population strata were eliminated: Independent farmers, ethnic minorities, members of the bourgeoisie, senior officers, intellectuals, artists, labor movement activists, “opposition members” who were defined completely randomly, and countless members of the Communist party itself. 

&gt;In his new, highly praised book “The War of the World, “Historian Niall Ferguson writes that no revolution in the history of mankind devoured its children with the same unrestrained appetite as did the Soviet revolution. In his book on the Stalinist purges, Tel Aviv University’s Dr. Igal Halfin writes that Stalinist violence was unique in that it was directed internally.

&gt;Lenin, Stalin, and their successors could not have carried out their deeds without wide-scale cooperation of disciplined “terror officials,” cruel interrogators, snitches, executioners, guards, judges, perverts, and many bleeding hearts who were members of the progressive Western Left and were deceived by the Soviet regime of horror and even provided it with a kosher certificate.

All these things are well-known to some extent or another, even though the former Soviet Union’s archives have not yet been fully opened to the public.

&gt;Who knows about this? Within Russia itself, very few people have been brought to justice for their crimes in the NKVD’s and KGB’s service. The Russian public discourse today completely ignores the question of “How could it have happened to us?” As opposed to Eastern European nations, the Russians did not settle the score with their Stalinist past.

&gt;And us, the Jews? An Israeli student finishes high school without ever hearing the name “Genrikh Yagoda,” the greatest Jewish murderer of the 20th Century, the GPU’s deputy commander and the founder and commander of the NKVD. 

&gt;Yagoda diligently implemented Stalin’s collectivization orders and is responsible for the deaths of at least 10 million people. His Jewish deputies established and managed the Gulag system. After Stalin no longer viewed him favorably, Yagoda was demoted and executed, and was replaced as chief hangman in 1936 by Yezhov, the “bloodthirsty dwarf.”

&gt;Yezhov was not Jewish but was blessed with an active Jewish wife. In his Book “Stalin: Court of the Red Star”, Jewish historian Sebag Montefiore writes that during the darkest period of terror, when the Communist killing machine worked in full force, Stalin was surrounded by beautiful, young Jewish women.

&gt;Stalin’s close associates and loyalists included member of the Central Committee and Politburo Lazar Kaganovich. Montefiore characterizes him as the “first Stalinist” and adds that those starving to death in Ukraine, an unparalleled tragedy in the history of human kind aside from the Nazi horrors and Mao’s terror in China, did not move Kaganovich.

&gt;Many Jews sold their soul to the devil of the Communist revolution and have blood on their hands for eternity. We’ll mention just one more: Leonid Reichman, head of the NKVD’s special department and the organization’s chief interrogator, who was a particularly cruel sadist.

In 1934, according to published statistics, 38.5 percent of those holding the most senior posts in the Soviet security apparatuses were of Jewish origin. 

&gt;They too, of course, were gradually eliminated in the next purges. In a fascinating lecture at a Tel Aviv University convention this week, Dr. Halfin described the waves of soviet terror as a “carnival of mass murder,” “fantasy of purges”, and “essianism of evil.” 

&gt;Turns out that Jews too, when they become captivated by messianic ideology, can become great murderers, among the greatest known by modern history.

&gt;The Jews active in official communist terror apparatuses, in the Soviet Union and abroad and who at times led them, did not do this, obviously, as Jews, but rather, as Stalinists, communists, and “Soviet people.” 

&gt;Therefore, we find it easy to ignore their origin and “play dumb”: What do we have to do with them? But let’s not forget them. My own view is different. 

&gt;I find it unacceptable that a person will be considered a member of the Jewish people when he does great things, but not considered part of our people when he does amazingly despicable things.

Even if we deny it, we cannot escape the Jewishness of “our hangmen,” who served the Red Terror with loyalty and dedication from its establishment. After all, others will always remind us of their origin.” Sever Polker ",t5_2qh4r,False,1427108211,t3_h1264,True

Here primary, secondary AND university education is free. You wanna be an engineer? You wanna be a doctor? You wanna be a psychologist? You wanna be an artist? You wanna be a lawyer? You only have to pay for books and transportation, for which you can get scholarships and a lot of help. Even second-hand books (I hear they don't let you use second hand books over there in North America). I see a huge difference between us and European/North American countries. I see that some people work before going into college or have to get loans from banks that they pay till their 40's. That's a huge complication. You'll need another loan for a car or a house or a holiday because you can't save up, or at least not much. And if you want to change to another career you have to pay a whole damn lot of money again.

Now this is how's it like for me. I study in the University of Buenos Aires, best college in Argentina. I started a month ago. I just went over to the university, signed up and they told me ""You start the 30th of March"". I started and I spend about $100 (arg pesos) in books. I could have gotten them second hand or for free. Our student council will give us 50% to 100% books for free with no explanation needed (although I think you are required to get involved into political stuff they do, but I guess you can get away with that). If you wanna change, you have to do some small paper work and you're done probably in less than a week, without spending a cent (well maybe books...). The bus probably goes from $1 peso to $20 pesos, depending how far you live. I suggest you translate all that to your currency, I think 4 or 5 pesos is 1 US dollar. There's also free classes you can sign up for for being a student in UBA or wherever you're studying. You can sign up for photography, dancing, acting, whatever! You also have discounts benefits for being students in certain things, but I guess that happens all around the world. There's Private Universities here too, but the ones that are the best and most well known are the public ones. I think you have to pay for doctorates and master degrees, but dammit, you have a degree already so you don't have to be working in McDonald's or Starbucks to save up for it. 

Maybe I'm not well informed and it's not as bad there. But from my point of view, I wouldn't go to college so easily if I had to pay the amount you have to pay for university that Americans/Europeans pay. I would either need scholarships real bad or rich parents. It so much better to have free post-secondary education, a lot of people are able to study. It's a pity most of them go abroad... ._. We have public education here with really good quality. The University of Buenos Aires instructed 5 people who got Nobel prizes. They didn't have to pay huge loans. They only had to sit down and study their asses off because they don't give the title in exchange of money.

By your ""logic"", archaeologically speaking, the people that have the most ""claim"" to that land are the descendants of the first people to settle there from the african migration, so the people that lived there around 70,000 BC.

Could you actually spell out that logic?  You're arguing that the jews displaced from europe by the Germans in the 30s and 40s should, instead of claiming the land their families had before they were displaced, instead move to palestine and displace the Arabs that have lived there in an act of ethnic cleansing mimicing the one that displaced them in europe?

So it's legal for the Jewish state of Israel to give jewish settlers land stolen from Arabs because Israel offered to compensate the Arabs for the land Israel has stolen but the Arabs refused because Israel was committing the war crime of ethnic cleansing, and the Arabs were taking the moral high ground, refusing to accept the money, just like a jewish person displaced from europe wouldn't look kindly on the german government saying ""sorry about stealing your land, we've decided to cleanse the land you ""owned"" as part of out overall plan to clear the area of your race entirely, how about you take some bribe money to whitewash our war crime?""

The casting team? Alright. I don't rate Gretorp and iNcontroL that hugely but they're doing an alright job.

The free stream quality? Shite. I dunno whether it's due to justin.tv being a terrible site for European audiences or a problem on the NASL's side but I've often watched matches both at 2AM GMT and at 6PM GMT (the time of the restream because I'm often not up late enough to watch the entirety of it) and watched as choppiness, stream lag, and even full minutes where the stream would buffer fucking RealPlayer style just ruined the quality.

The price. Maybe $25 is a good price for a tournament as big as the NASL for VODs and a decent quality stream but I refuse to pay that for several reasons:

* IGN and Dreamhack provide VODs for free even if they're ad supported. Why should I pay for the North American Star League when other (slightly smaller scale) tournaments release their VODs for free, and in the days where other better casters like Husky, TotalBiscuit, Moletrap, X, TMStarcraft, HD, Crota etc do YouTube commentary videos for free but ad supported?
* The production quality of the NASL is questionable considering its budget, and clearly they had a pretty good budget considering the prize pool!
* They can't even get their free stream working. It's worse than the one for fucking MLG Dallas, and that was a TERRIBLE stream. Why should I have to pay $25 for a stream which may not even work on my end considering I'm in Britain and the free stream is almost non-functional at times.
* They don't provide replays, something which Dreamhack has already beaten them (and the GSL and possibly IGN) on.
* I think of all the things to spend $25 on, a pass to watch Starcraft II matches don't seem like the best thing to spend it on.
* Considering my current PC specs, a 1080p stream would be laggy for me.

The site for EU viewers is hardly spoiler free when the restream is on. Unfortunately, that and the Liquibets system on TeamLiquid is probably the only (free) way I can find out the results because of how bad the free stream is, as I said before.

Don't get me wrong, I think ad revenue must be shite if the NASL and GSL must resort to making VODs and a HD stream a premium feature, I'm just giving my two pence on the issue here and why I don't plan to directly be a customer. I understand I will get a lot of downvotes from people saying ""Fuck you, heretic. You clearly hate e-sports if you are refusing to pay for such a huge and significant event and let e-sports flourish in the West as a result."" In that case, I honestly do not give a shit.

In a civilization that raises cows, there's an inherent benefit for people that are able to digest cow's milk (hence the Swedes and, really, most of Europe).

I know the feeling.  We Libertarians get really disheartened when we see Progressives respecting peace only part of the time, rather than all of the time.  When some Libertarians converse with Progressives, and see Progressives refusing to work with their fellow mankind peacefully, and instead see them advocating for involuntary, compulsory, ""do this or else you will be sent to prison"" solutions to various complex social problems, I think you can hopefully understand why Progressives get slammed by Libertarians.

Libertarians and Progressives can get along perfectly fine when it comes to civil matters.  Ending the drug war, defending gay marriage, pro-choice, ""live and let live"" mentality, etc.

But when it comes to economic matters, Libertarians are disheartened to see Progressives ""turn to the dark side"" so to speak.  When a typical Libertarian and a Progressive are sitting in a park together on a bench having a chat, I don't think either of them will think that if they have a disagreement about something, that either of them will pull out a gun and point it at the other person and say ""Agree with me and do what I say or else.""  Well, unless of course they disagree with each other on whether one of them has the right to hit the other over the head.  In those kinds of disagreements, the context of peace is already lost.  In all other disagreements, I think neither will threaten the other with violence if there is disagreement.

But the Libertarian always sees Progressives calling for exactly that all the friggin time from the government.  From roads, to education, to healthcare, to welfare and social security, the Progressive goes from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde.  He/she goes from recoiling at the thought of pulling out a gun at the Libertarian on the park bench, to advocating for others, in government, who have guns, to do just that to the Libertarian.  The Progressive says to the Libertarian ""I won't be evil and point a gun at you to get what I want from you.  But I will advocate for others to point a gun at you so that you will obey and accommodate my desire to enact X, where X = government financed education, or healthcare, or welfare, etc.""

If you asked me, I think most Libertarians are not harsh to the Progressive enough.  Here the Progressives are supporting and calling for guns to be pointed at Libertarians so that the Progressive economic plans can be enacted.  Do you have any heart at all?  Do you have any idea how evil it is deep down?  Sure, you might think that the end goal is moral and good.  After all, who WOULDN'T want all children to receive a half decent education, who WOULDN'T want the elderly to be ensured that they are taken care of in their state of relative weakness and need?  Who in their right mind would be *against* this?

The Libertarian is not against any of these goals.  What the Libertarian is against is pointing guns at people as a means to get to those goals.  The Progressive has no problems pointing guns at people to achieve these goals.  When they see Libertarians object to these economic plans, they almost always interpret this rejection as the Libertarian being somehow against the idea of educating children, or helping the elderly.  But that is just a reflection of the Progressive's inability, or unwillingess, to accept and understand peaceful solutions.

If I pointed a gun at you, and demanded that you give me your money or else I'll shoot you, and I say to you that I am going to use your money to help finance the construction of a school for blind children, then my guess is that you will object to my actions.  Not because you're against helping blind children, but because you are against people pointing a gun at you and stealing from you.  Suppose you did tell me that pointing a gun at you and stealing from you is wrong.  Would it make any sense for me to then say to you ""OMG, I can't believe this.  You are actually against helping blind children!  How heartless can you get???!!?  You're selfish! Cold hearted! Greedy! etc, etc, etc.""

The Libertarian just wants people to put their guns away, and only pull them out for one reason and one reason only: Only when some violent asshole pulls his out first to be used as offense.  The Libertarian wants guns to be used as a defense only, and not as an offense like the Progressive does when it comes to the government's guns.

The government is not an institution that takes care of people.  At most, AT MOST, the only legitimate action of the government is to use its guns as a defense only.  The police to protect individuals from initiations of violence at home, and the military to protect individuals from initiations of violence from abroad.  Anything more than that, and the government is doing exactly what it is supposed to stop, namely initiations of violence.

The founders established a government in this country for the purposes of defense against violence.  They were wrong of course, but not because a government is supposed to do more than just defend, but also house, educate and provide social security to people, but rather they were wrong because the very formation of the state was a violation of individual rights for those who were living there already in peace and did not want to join the state system of taxation and protection.  Because the very formation of the state was an initiation of violence, the founders creation of a minarchist state, was doomed to keep growing as subsequent generations kept coming up with new uses of government violence.  Instead of just defense and protection, and the necessary minimal individual rights violations that is implied by minarchist states, Progressives relentlessly demanded, and succeeding in getting, the state to increase its offensive violence against the American population itself, in the name of helping it.  Instead of advocating for peaceful methods to solve complex social problems, the Progressives advocated for violent methods.  Their advocacy of state violence was due to the philosophical influence of socialism coming from Europe.  Marxism was a huge influence all over the world, and succeeded in establishing Communism in the 20th century in eastern Europe, Asia, and South America.  It even succeeded in establishing social security, medicare and medicaid, and centralized banking in the US.  The conflict between communism and capitalism is irreconcilable, because when it comes to ownership of physical resources, there is only one alternative.  Either the population owns the means of production on behalf of the individual in a dispersed fashion (capitalism), or the government owns the means of production on behalf of all (communism).

The solution in the US was to adopt a ""middle of the road"" policy.  Free market capitalism combined with centrally planned communism.  Central banking in this country, and almost all other countries, is communist.  Whenever the government has a monopoly on any production, it is communist.  Central banking is communist production of money.  

When the Libertarian sees Progressives calling for government to solve every social problem that arises, they vehemently defend against it, because the Libertarian doesn't want violence to be used as the solution.  Violence simply does not solve the myriad of complex social problems that arise in human life.

The Progressive deserves all the harsh words they receive from Libertarians, because harsh words of violence advocacy are coming from the Progressives.  Of course they dress up the harshness with euphemisms and Orwellian catch phrases.  The Libertarian is direct, and will not tolerate such touchy feely emotionally laden kind words that in reality have vicious actions backing it.",t5_2cneq,False,1427108595,t3_gznoy,True

Some are worth seeing (Temple of Heaven, Forbidden City), other places are not (Houhai hutongs). I'm assuming since you're on r/travel, you want to see the ""real"" side of a city, and not the touristy bullshit people usually do:

    Roast Duck:

Someone will drag you to a roast duck restaurant. It's absolutely delicious, and there are a few places that do it well. The one all the foreigners (and people from China) go to is ""Quan Jude"". The most famous one. However, all the native Beijingers know that ""Da Zhong"" is the best roast duck in Beijing. A well-kept secret.

For another shop, ""Bian Yifang"", the oldest roast duck place (est. 1416) and is steeped in tradition.

    Bars:

The common bar street is ""Sanlitun"" close to the Embassy district (I think it's actually located in Chaoyang district), but the best bar street is in ""Houhai"". It's a series of 2-3 interconnected lakes in the middle of the city, very close to the main street (Chang'an). You can rent a electric boat for cheap, and drink your night away either on the boat, or one of the many bars that line the sides of the lakes.

I don't go out much in Beijing as I'm usually with family. But the good bar districts are in Chaoyang and Dongcheng. Both are heavily Westernized and by no means cheap.

    Art:

This area I don't know too much about. However, there is a street specializing in traditional Chinese art and calligraphy somewhere close to one of the 8 Quanjude locations in Beijing. I went there with my grandfather to get a calligraphy piece framed. Also not a tourist trap and primarily serves Chinese artists and hobbists. The pieces here are fairly certain to be done by hand. Whereas if you buy art in a tourist district, it will be a reprint, but for much cheaper. If that's what you're looking for. See below:

    Knockoffs:

Two are the most famous. The first is ""Yaxiu"" in the embassy district. The second is ""Xiu Shui Jie"" in Chaoyang district.

The latter is easier to get to as there is a subway station directly connected to it. The station is either ""Yong Anli"" or ""Da Wanglu"", I can't remember, but both of them are on the main line (the one that runs in front of Tiananmen square).

Personally, I think Xiu Shui Jie is much better. Prices are bargainable, but don't go on weekends (more people, means less prices for you). You'll get outrageous prices as a foreigner, but take it from a local:

T-Shirts: 30-40 yuan Button up shirts: 40-60 yuan Hats: 20-30 yuan

Buy in bulk to get a better price.

Another one is ""Tianyi"" for small knicknacks, curiosities, and just fun little things. I love this place.

    Food:

Beijing specializes in Northern cuisine, particularly influenced by Shandong and the N. Eastern styles. Imperial cuisine is large too, but I think you would be lost trying to order it. Northern China is fairly conservative in terms of cuisine, and you'll rarely find anything besides beef, pork, chicken, or lamb on the menu.

Things to try:

   1.

      Zha Jiang Mian: Speciality of Beijing. There's a place called ""Lao Beijing Zha Jiang Mein"" that makes a mean bowl. They're franchised so you can find it.
   2.

      Yoshinoya: Not Chinese, but a Japanese franchise. They have an AMAZING beef and rice bowl. Definitely should try.
   3.

      La Mian: Hand-made noodles. Very cheap. Try this at a mall foodcourt (Da Pai Dang).
   4.

      Street food: Found behind Wangujing in the Dongcheng district at night. A bustling street food market that's sanitary (that have operating permits as opposed to vendors off the street), delicious, and includes a mammoth amount of variety. You can avoid Wangfujin during the day unless you want to buy expensive watches and clothes. Not worth seeing as a tourist in my opinion, no different than any other shopping area in the world. On the flip side, China's first McDonalds opened here.

Try the ""Yang rou chuan"" or Lamb-Skewers. Brought in by the Uighurs from Western China, it is absolutely fucking amazing. For a few bucks, you can get 4-5 skewers, the classic Beijing street food. Other Bejing classics are ""Tang Hulu"" or candied-apples.

   1. Hotpot: OMFG good. Get platefuls of meat and throw them in the boiling broth for 10-20 seconds to cook it. Immediately dip in the mandatory peanut sauce. Heaven in a mouthful.

Go to the franchise ""Xiabu Xiabu"". It's a Taiwanese franchise, but they have very fresh cuts of uber-thin sliced beef, pork and a ton of other stuff. Impeccably clean and great service. Going close to lunch or dinner will almost certainly involve a wait, especially in the winter.

I also recommend the Vermicelli (very common in Beijing) and a ""shao bin"" (a chinese pancake) to make sandwiches with your freshly cooked beef. Ask for the pepper oil to add a kick.

   1. Other: Baozi (Gou Buli is AMAZING), jiaozi (find a dumpling restaurant. Classic Northern Chinese fillings are pork + lettuce, pork + jiucai (garlic chives, chinese leeks, this is most authentic filling), pork + leaf mustard.

Any mall food-court. The better mall food courts are Sogou, Golden Resources Mall (4th ring), Chang'an (they have both a Yoshinoya AND a Xiabu Xiabu. A huge dilemma for me everytime).

    Hutongs

Hutongs are small and narrow alleyways that represent ""Old-Beijing"". Most of them have been demolished to make way for high-rises, mainly because a ""classic"" hutong has a square courtyard in the middle, and the bedrooms surrounding it. The high population density of Beijing doesn't allow for this anymore.

The ones near Houhai are almost certainly tourist traps. Companies run rickshaw companies to take tourists in. Not authentic at all. However, some families in order to capitalize on this trend, open up their homes to the public, of course for a fee. If you actually want to see what one looks like on the inside, you'll have to go this route.

If not, rent a bicycle and visit the hutongs in ""Xidan"". A beautiful and old neighborhood in it's own right, the hutongs here are much less well-known. The good thing about these, is that they are 100% authentic. No tourist bullshit, and the people who live here are ""real"" people and not rich guys buying the ultra-expensive hutongs near Houhai. Most of them are scheduled to be demolished, but its been over 20 years, and still no movement to do so. Nonetheless, visit them before they're gone forever.

    Other things to do:

Get a massage. A real one, not the one you're thinking of you horny bastard. It's a lot cheaper than the US, and it'll make you feel hella good.

There's a massage parlor I usually go to in the Chaoyang district in a hotel. It's very close to the Kerry center, but they offer all you can eat snacks and noodles while you get your massage, a double win. Most nice hotels will all have this service, again, for much cheaper than the US. Feel free to look around

Go the summer palace. It's not too far away from the center of the city, a 50-60 yuan cab ride. Still within the 4th ring road, so still considered part of the city now. It's absolutely gorgeous, if you have time, wander around the Long Corridor. Containing 14,000 pieces of art adorned upon each doorway. The art series tell famous stories and events in Chinese literature. From ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" to ""The Dream of Red Mansions"". Commissioned in 1750, it is both historic, and absolutely gorgeous.

The Old Summer Palace. This is in the middle of the city. The Europeans burned it down during the retaliation for the Boxer Rebellion. It's an extremely cool park, and also very eerie at night due to the burnt down ruins that have been allowed. It's a good place to go to in order to understand the current psyche of China, a reminder of the bullying China withstood in the early-1900's. They don't call it a ""hundred years of shame"" for nothing.

The CCTV tower is the tallest building in Beijing. Has a rotating, buffet-style restaurant in the middle (the buffet is EXCELLENT), and offers gorgeous, 360 views of Beijing. Close to Chang'an jie, so it's smackdab in the middle of the city.

For electronics, then Zhong guan cun. Termed the ""silicon-valley"" of China, its an extremely dense block with high-rises chocked full of electronics (10 stories of small shops set up flea market style). If you're a tech geek, you'll be blown away. Think Newegg... but in person. Prices also bargainable, but not much cheaper than the US. Don't come here expecting to get a deal on anything besides memory (flash or otherwise).

Man, there's so much I can tell you. What are you interested in? Do you wear glasses? Go to ""Pan Jia Yuan"", I get glasses in China all the time. Got my last pair over 2 years ago there, quality is great and they'll match your prescription. Might as well go to the source, all the glasses in Wal-Mart and Pearl Vision and exported from China anyways. You can get a nice pair of glasses in Beijing for about... 40-50USD per pair. Buy more and the price drops more. 

For traveling. During the peak times, subway is the fastest. Prepare to get crushed though. They are VERY full during rush hour. Taxis are cheap, usually 2.00 yuan per kilometer. A ride from the airport to the city is about the most expensive ride you'll have, roughly 130 yuan (20 dollars). A ride from most places in the city is about 60-80 yuan at most (just over 13 dollars).

Lastly, Beijing is HUGE, with a population of 16-17 million (officially only 12 million based on ""hukou"", but the reality is much higher).

0,,c1ru6tb,,1,False,[deleted],1304231686,AskReddit,0,,t1_c1ru6tb,t3_h11tw,1,0,"When I was younger I had a recurring dream in which I was in the back of a lorry moving down a narrow, european/old-world style street. The (unseen) driver would always be driving erratically and dangerously, as if intoxicated or panicked. Near the end of the dream, the truck would fail to make a turn, or the driver would apparently lose control and we would fall off a cliff or bridge into this haunting, black abyss. As I aged, the back of the truck became increasingly packed with uniformed men, young and old, sombre-faced and resigned to some miserable fate. This detail seemed to coincide with the increasing frequency of explosions and violence in the scenery/background of the dream.

The other dream that comes to mind would have been from a couple days ago. In it the hair had fallen out on one half of my head, and the balding area had turned a deep purple, of the same shade as Gorbachev's wine stain. It was causing me a lot of pain, and I told my friends that I was afraid my head would cave in. They didn't believe me. But when I layed down in the dream, nothing happened, and I was very relieved.

0,,c1ruaed,,0,True,devedander,1304233861,reddit.com,0,,t1_c1ruaed,t1_c1ru7rc,0,0,"&gt;This is wrong on so many levels. A store never has half of their lanes open, even the day before Thanksgiving. Self-checkout lanes replace normal lanes at a 1:1 ratio. Self-checkouts take more time than a cashier. People never choose self-checkouts over a cashier.

This is wrong on an aboslute level.  You said never.  Unfortunately in any logic or debate course they will teach you aboslutes make your argument all but useless because it's almost certain at least one exception will be found which then makes you wrong.

To be precies many grocery stores around me regularly have half their lines open (and saldy those lines often have more than 3 people per). 

I don't know where you are from, but in my city there are 3 Safeways and 2 Lucky's that make up pretty much all the major grocery store options.

On any given day, during normal busy hours (lunch and around 5PM) you will find at least half the lies open and usually most of the lines open.

So right there you are wrong.  Let me ask you the obvoius question: In a world with margins as tight as grocery - how do you figuer most (let alone EVERY) store decides to build SO MANY lines that they never need more than half open - even the day before thanksgiving?  Stop and think about that for a second... does that sound likely let alone plausible?  That EVERY store would, during planning, decide they expect to need 5 lines, so build 15 just for the heck of it resulting in never opening more than half?  Because that is precisely what would have to happen to make your statement that no store every has more than half it's lines open at any given time.

Next self checkouts do not replace regular checks at 1:1.

Again I know this because 3 of my local groceries have self checkout sections that were added in the last few years.  In all of them 2 regular checkoutlines were removed and a 4 pack of self checks put in.  These have 1 cashier watching over them. 

Here they have actually packed 6 into the space of 2 checkout lines, in my area we only have 2 on each side http://www.aimlessfury.com/pics/self-checkout-station.jpg

So wrong again - self checks (at least around me) tend to fit about 2 times as many registers in the same space.

Lastly again must be your area, but around me, people OFTEN choose a self check.  I certainly do and you can often see people in line for self check 3 or 4 deep. 

Of course if there is an EMPTY full service cashier, usually people would do that, but even then not always.  I personally will use a self check for a quick and easy item simply because I have yet to run into a self check isle that makes me stand there for 3 minutes while changing the ribbon, exchanging cash drawers or chatting with another employee (either about busines or personal issues).

Add to this I have seen a few (admittedly rare times) when cahsiers are standing at the head of their empty check lines ready to get customers and people just heading right to the self checks.

So wrong again.

&gt;Even though this is never the case, let's go with your figures.

I said it was for easy math.  The point is that unless a self check is MUCH slower than a regular checkout, it will cost jobs.  To be precise: If one person can monitor 4 self checks, the self check method must be 4 times slower to not cost jobs.  That time has to include the oddities like food stamps/WIC, Checks (that self check doesn't take as far as I know) gettings cigarettes from the cage (which adds a full minute onto a checkout easily) etc.  

There are of course cases where cashiers are faster - produce being the obvious.  But then it's balanced out by the fact you will never be heald up waiting for someone to grab cigarettes from the cage in a self check line or have to wait for food stamps/WIC to be used in a self check line.

&gt;Assuming people will do self-checkout first (which, again, is never the case), each one does 40 people per hour. That leaves 520 people to go through the normal cashier lines. This means you need nine other cashiers. Therefore, no jobs lost.

I don't get your math... you said that 1 person can watch over 5 self checks (I said 4 which is favorable to your argument so lets go with 4) at 40 per hour, that is 160 patrons.  Of the 600 that leaves 440 to serve. 

440 patrons can be served at 1 minute a piece by 7.3 cashiers.  Round that up to 8 if you like and you are still down one full cashier.  More than likely management would round that down to 7 and expect those 7 to just be a little faster thus 2 jobs. 

Think about this - why would stores spend money on self checks if it doens't save them on employee costs?  Self checks cost to install, cost to train on and open you up to theft and abuse (people can just lie about produce numbers and or just pocket stuff)?  

I garauntee you that when the store was sold self check machines, some math like we just went thorugh was used to show how they could cut so much staff that the self checks would pay for themselves and probably actually come out ahead.

&gt;I wouldn't accept this argument (or yours for that matter) because the figures are nowhere near realistic. The store is never taking in a constant number of people per hour, checkout time varies greatly from customer to customer, and cashiers are supposed to have a ton of downtime.

You are right... the number are far to sterile and even for a real store... unfrotunately fluctuating numbers make an argument for self checks instead of cashiers. 

Think about it -  every full service line with a cashier can handle one lines worth of people.  If it gets busier, that one cashier cannot suddenly man two stations.

Now take a self check where one cashier can handle 4 stations.  

If it's dead you are still only paying one cashier to do nothing, same in both circumstances.

However if it gets bumping, you will have to bring on another few cashiers to help that one single full service cashier. 

However the one cashier watching the self check lines is probably doing fine with 4 (or 5) people moving through the lines. 

Your own point works against you.

As for down time, I don't know what stores or managers you have but I have NEVER seen ANY business where the employees are supposed to have a lot of downtime.  In a business like grocery I absolutely do not believe any manager stays in business by ""expecting a lot of downtime""

In every store around me if you are not actively checking, you go back to stocking, facing, inventory, cleaning... something... there is always more work than there are people.  You will  NEVER see more than 1 cashier idle.  If your line is empty, you lock your terminal and go do something until the remaining lines call for backup cashiers. 

During slow periods you wlil actually see NO lines staffed and a bell to ring when you are ready to check out.  One cashier will stock/face/inventory near that line and be ready to come when you ring the bell. 

If you have a grocery store where there are every more than 1 idle cashier for any period of time, you are either paying very high markups (to cover labor) or that store is shutting down soon (or maybe a money laundering front).

&gt;The store has a minimum number of cashiers that need to be employed at a time, and the union demands that each cashier be given a minimum number of hours every week. For every person watching self-checkout, the wait of the customer greatly decreases.

Having serveral friends who work grocery I can tell you that minimum staffing is decided by estimated customer load for a given day and shift.  And I can also tell you that basically the store staffs as most of their staff can do an entire 8 hour stock job and somehow magically cover a retigster occasionally in an 8 hour shift.   And by occasionally I mean really it turns out to be 1 or 2 hours of cashier.

They are constantly running and constantly running out of time to finish their duties and OT is surprisngly common due to this. 

This is why you never see cashiers idle - becuase they are not really cashiers, they are stockers who have taken time out to run a register and are need to get back to their job ASAP or they will run OT.

&gt;I honestly don't get why this isn't totally obvious to everyone or why my previous explanation didn't totally cover the concept.

I can only guess you live in an area where the stores run nothing like the ones in most major cities in California, the countires I have been to in Europe or China. 

Seriously - where do you live?  I am curiuos where they swap out full serve to self serve check lines 1:1 and cashiers are epxected to have lots of downtime...

Your logic only works if in your location they really do replace full service isles with 1 self check isle (and then I don't get how one person can monitor 5 as they are pretty spread out).  

Tell you what - you take a picture of this store of yours where one regular lane was replaced with one self service lane (like that one I posted above which was just from somewebsite) around noon on a normal day showing less than half their lines open.  If you can do that, I will believe you were at least just a victim of circumstance (although still shouldn't have clamed that it's true always since you can't know that).",t5_6,False,1427108772,t3_h0z6i,True

Not exactly. If you check you'll find that all western european countries _with a state church_ are largely secular. The secularity of society is IMO a function of the secularity of the state, which runs the church.

In countries where the church is independent of the state (e.g. the catholic countries and the US) society is more religious, while the worst fundamentalism is found in countries where a church runs the state (Iran!).

Imagine that by default all americans were born in to the Church of America, led by bishops appointed by Bush and Obama, and with a creed determined by congress, and it's pretty easy to see that it by necessity must be a pretty secular church.

There's still a metric crapload of evangelizing (both Christian and Islam) going on in Africa, and Christianity is spreading pretty strongly in China.

The appeal to popularity is pretty ineffective, though. Even in my High School, a popular ""argument"" was: ""Eat shit! A million flies can't be wrong!""

It might be instructive to dismantle *why* Christianity and Islam are so popular. Somewhat surprisingly, to some, [intolerance and violence were the ""secrets"" of their success](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/fxunu/what_is_it_about_yehwah_that_makes_him_the/c1jfkux). 

In my younger days, I used to wonder what happened to the mysterious Druids of northern Britain, and the folks who worshipped the trees and stuff. Why does Europe seem to be a religious monoculture? Did the pagan religions lose adherents because Christ's message was ""better?"" No, the pagans were simply slaughtered by the millions.

&gt; 16th and 17th century Ireland. English troops ""pacified and civilized"" Ireland, where only Gaelic ""wild Irish"", ""unreasonable beasts lived without any knowledge of God or good manners, in common of their goods, cattle, women, children and every other thing."" 

&gt; One of the more successful soldiers, a certain Humphrey Gilbert, half-brother of Sir Walter Raleigh, ordered that

&gt;&gt; ""the heddes of all those (of what sort soever thei were) which were killed in the daie, should be cutte off from their bodies... and should bee laied on the ground by eche side of the waie"", which effort to civilize the Irish indeed caused ""greate terrour to the people when thei sawe the heddes of their dedde fathers, brothers, children, kinsfolke, and freinds on the grounde"".

&gt; Tens of thousands of Gaelic Irish fell victim to the carnage.

Consequences aren't effective arguments for or against the truth of a belief; but consider this: If the moral and other superiority of Christianity was so obvious, why did it have to be spread by violent slaughter?

Racism and classism can be subtle in America, believe it or not.  I grew up in a wealthy W.A.S.P town (private schools etc), but then had the good fortune to slum in cities as a musician for a decade, and then travel the country.  L.A.'s racism is a free-for-all, with every group distrustful of every other, but rarely personally.  That is: the korean liquor stores will have one hand on the shotgun as soon as a black man walks in, and say horrible slurs - but take the same korean woman and sit her down with a black woman for coffee or a meeting and *none* of that will be visible on the surface.  It's the same for basically everyone except the artist communities (very cosmopolitan) and the wealthy (flat-out racist - just look at Hollywood).

Boston's racism is more classist: the city is divide by ethnicity and strata, to the point that you can tell the time by what color the people are on whatever subway you're riding.  They're polite, but they don't *intermingle* very much, which is simply impossible in LA.  Boston also has a very pronounced ""old money"" race/class issue, which I'll get back to.

In rural New England no-one cares because there's no real criminal class.  Connecticut OTOH is filled with white trash calling everyone else trash.  In the rural KY/TN area it is the most average: a *small* percentage of the poor whites and the rich whites still agree that it's the lower races who are to blame for God not smiling on our good baptist community.  It's quite amazing that Rand Paul won a senate race, actually.  Aquabuddha, Ho!

Everyone normal in Phoenix AZ has long accepted the massive and ongoing Latino influx as part of doing business.  The two problem areas are the LA gangs on the west side, and all the ex-Nazi German retirees in Sedona, who pay for the un-fucking-believably corrupt and racist cops state wide.  AK and NY are the only two states more palpably corrupt, and I've lived in FL and TX too.

But you know what?  Maybe it's my cultural bias, but the most racist communities I've found are white, protestant, upper middle class, and vote democratic.  They erected a sign on the town line that said ""[Town] Celebrates Diversity!"", to which someone with spray paint appended ""but not with MY daughter"".  They bus in ""poor"" (read: black) children from the city, but Cornel West will be respectfully declined admission to the yacht clubs.  There is just enough of a memory of the 60-70's for them to *believe* in equality-and-all-that, but so long out of the habit of practicing it they've slipped back into tribalism.  And that's why Boston's race/classism is so indicative of the issue in America.  All the new wealth and underclasses don't care - we've always been the melting pot and we know it's a good thing.  And there are some poor folks of all races who succumb to scape-goating, but the real injustices come from the older money and power structures.  If I said ""freemason"" it's untrue but evocative: that order of people who insulate themselves from society by imposing a meaningless hierarchy of class and then clawing their way to the top of it.  It is those people who have a chuckle at giving black men syphillis, bombing gooks, and funding both the KKK and Beyonce police state videos.

a) there was no real class mobility in the US. What mobility existed was based on millions of immigrants migrating into America and physically lifting up the social pyramid by crawling in as the underclass. If you simply held onto your current social status, you were 'upwardly mobile' simply because of the effect of mass immigration. If you exploited the hell out of them, you could be rich

b) The purpose of mandatory public schooling threefold:  
i) to train workers for a more modern factory especially those workers who were recent immigrants. (child labor was allowed at this time, so some training was already provided by the owners to get them to be useful)    
ii) get non-english speaking immigrants up to speed to be used as cannon fodder after abyssmal WWI performance. This included fomenting nationalism, a national culture and american character and providing an innoculation against socialist tendencies that were becoming popular among an exploited working class.   
iii) to mollify the flaring tensions between labor and capitalists caused by kids getting killed in unsafe working conditions and who couldn't be instructed to avoid death, because they didn't have the necessary education while living in huge immigrant ghettos. (this is back when most ny ghettos were full of white ppl) 

Child labor wasn't even wholly abolished till the late 1930's, and I'm going to guess that mandatory public schooling only started at about that time.

None of this was done to create class mobility, but none of this stopped class mobility either. What stopped class mobility was the end of massive legal immigration that allowed european serfs to enter the country in huge numbers to lift the overall social pyramid by becoming the new base. 

After ww2 america became an uncontested globe spanning empire and there was no longer any need to haul foreigners into america for cheap labor, it was simply easier to exploit them in their homelands and ship the fruits of their labor into the country. This killed the need for america's original immigration policy and we've been stagnating since.

Why this is correct is open to debate, and the details have been lost to history, but it's probably due to the gender of boats being female in most Indo-European languages.

In fact, most models predict an increase in local temperature volatility, so many places will in fact get *colder*, and that's expected.

However, the sum total -- the integral, specifically -- of temperature over the year and the earth's entire surface is increasing, and this is what is meant. So, for example, if it gets colder by a few degrees in the US (say) and hotter by a few degrees more in the Sahara, there is a *net* increase in *global* temperature. Essentially, the earth's atmosphere is retaining more heat, but it doesn't do it evenly.

One of the big problems here is that it appears that many of the places that are getting warmer and wetter are in the arctic and antarctic. While this is happening, the gulf stream (which coincidentally is what keeps Europe, including Iceland, more or less temperate instead of having it be like Canada or Siberia, which given its latitude would be consistent) is shifting.

So, TL;DR -- massive shifts in global climate, including an increase in temperature volatility, meaning more cold as well as more hot, is not incompatible with global warming.

Apple products provide a 1 year limited warranty - they will honour that agreement with respect to parts and labour. 

A *retailer* is required under EU law (EU directive in question is 1999/44/EC) simply known as the EU productive directive of 1999. It requires retailers to provide goods which are
 &gt;'as described, fit for purpose and of satisfactory quality'

so if you purchase it at a store (whether it is tax free at an airport or not) the person that sold it to you (not apple) has to provide you with some recourse. THIS IS NOT A WARRANTY IT IS A GUARANTEE. There is an important difference. 

The person selling it to you is not bound by the guarantee 
&gt;'if the (fault) has its origin in materials supplied by the consumer'

The main thing the EU rule provides is that it means if you go back to the shop where you bought it you are not required to show the fault is inherent in the product and not down to their actions - but this does not mean they are bound to the guarantee if the product shows any signs of damage OR no *exact and specific* fault can be found.

I think the issues legalized polygamy would create already exist in the US due to decades of a high divorce and remarriage rates. A review of family court case law and some thoughtful legislation would take care of things. The latter part is where the real poop storm will happen, as US politics is as much side show and fear mongering as anything else. The airwaves would be saturated with pundits crying about all the usual problems associated with polygamist cultures, and claiming the very existence of the US was threatened. 

Child brides would not be directly addressed because child brides are not a product of polygamy, but a product of the culture. It is a separate issue. 

Given your statements, and as a person who actually lives in the United States, I’m going to say your opinion of the regard of women in the US is a hyperbolic caricature. 

First, the groups you are referring to, like the FLDS, are *extreme* groups, who live in, who *must* live in isolated communities that they control. To suggest that the culture of the FLDS is even remotely representative of general US culture is absurd. It’s like judging technology in the US using the Amish as the representative example. The FLDS is a small minority of a minority who are viewed even by mainstream mormons (themselves a more sexists culture within the US,) as extremist nutters. 

(Tho, the LDS still practices an underhanded, magical version of polygamy, but more likely than not a random mormon will be anti-polygamy if asked, and sometimes won’t even believe that polygamy was ever part of the LDS.)

Second, I imagine you’re from a European country that does regard women better than the general US. But if you’re going to say, “as a *European* woman”, I’m going to include the whole of Europe, and we can go tit for tat over the examples and levels of misogyny and sexism. And you chose abortion as an example? While it’s true we in the US have to continuously fight attacks from the religious right and others with a perceived moral imperative, abortion is legal in the US. In fact, it is practically a defacto right. A glance at abortion law in Europe [here,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_law#Europe) and it seems that plenty of countries even in the EU have more restrictive laws on abortion than the US. Abortion isn’t a factor in this, however.

The reason legalized polygamy wouldn’t lead to a culture like the FLDS, with its associated problems, is women in the US are expected to be educated (in general), can own property, pursue a career; and most importantly chose if and whom to marry and divorce at the drop of a hat. They are individual citizens which no longer require the guardianship of a man. 
So if a man wants to take another wife (assuming there isn’t a law preventing him doing so without the consent of his other spouses) the wife can divorce him. Or, since the law would be equally applied, she could also marry another man, if only out of spite. 

Legalizing polygamy would, I think, do little more than allow a small minority who are already in polygamous relationships, represented by the OP, so obtain a legal status for their relationships. The liberal marriage laws and culture in the US have already been shaped by proclivities of the majority, and so most people will continue on with the status quo of serial monogamy, legally in marriage as they do informally in relationships.  

Tho, it may present problems for those in a more… “European polygamous relationship,” if an accepted mistress can now also be legally married to the married man. :P

I actually think there's two different philosophical points here where we disagree:

a) The idea that society is competitive vs supportive. Take this sentence, for example:

&gt; You can't expect to be a burger-flipper and demand 3 months paid vacation. Why? You are incredibly replaceable.

... I don't think it should be necessary for someone to ""demand"" time off, because if you drift societal niceties down to the level of what people can argue, you tend to penalise the poor and the unskilled. And I think they should have a nice time, too.

At this level, my taste is to prefer the state to step in and guarantee good things for everyone. As I said above, I don't think it's too destructive of the economy, and the state is the only actor strong enough to ensure the weak don't get trampled.

b) The idea that people should only get what they work for vs what society can afford to distribute.

Take this sentence for example:

&gt; if you want something out you need to put in.

... why? Other than through a philosophy that demands it, why should this be the case? To me, it doesn't seem scientific.

I've found before that some people subscribe to a belief as an item of faith (I have no idea if this matches you or not, by the way, this is just an aside to help explain things), and I've often seen it in Americans, but it's so far outside my own experience and belief it's hard to discuss things.

It's admirable in many ways, because it leads to self-sufficiency and independence. But I also think it's quite wrong:

It's the idea that someone should only receive what they work for.

Here's a thought experiment. Imagine you can somehow measure happiness across the country. And for the sake of argument let's imagine it's true happiness (art, connectedness, joy, love of fellows, whatever you like) and not something that would happen if people were just drugged.


Now, imagine a policy that tries to maximise this happiness by varying things and seeing what has the most effect.

... if it turned out that having ten percent unemployment and long leisure time both worked and maximised public happiness, then that would be a scientific fact (in our imaginary universe).

But I think many people, particularly a number of Americans, would dislike the policy regardless. Even if under all possible systems they would be on average less happy, there seems to be a philosophical position that they just don't want to give things to people who don't earn it.

Take this sentence:

&gt; I don't think any economic policy that accepts high unemployment should be considered.

... from my point of view, why ever not? The question for me is whether it generally increases happiness and makes society a better place. But, as I say, I think it's like Marmite. Some people wouldn't accept certain policies even if they were proven to work better.

Now if you say that's you, then here we can talk no more, because we're onto articles of faith.

But, if you think that the answer is to do whatever works, then all I can say is that from my position in Western Europe, I think we have a better standard of living by running our governments with lots of benefits - and I much prefer it to the alternatives.",t5_2cneq,False,1427109707,t3_gzeao,True

I don't think this applies to me, but maybe you do think so. The problem is the ambiguity of ""works better."" This is extremely subjective.

But I don't necessarily agree. **Overall** success/fitness/utility/whatever is not a good measure of ""working better,"" in my opinion.

&gt;During the past year, the idea was approved by many Arab countries and most African countries. The only opponents were the Republic of South Africa and the head of the League of Arab States. The initiative was viewed negatively by the USA and the European Union, with **French President Nicolas Sarkozy calling Libya a threat to the financial security of mankind**; but Gaddafi was not swayed and continued his push for the creation of a united Africa.

It's among the least fair economic systems possible and is a natural historical development out of the conditions in europe during the industrial revolution, when feudalism was ending, and the rural population was forced toward the cities to sell their labour power by working in mills and factories. Capitalism does not produce goods based on social necessity, but rewards production of the same product by competing companies, each trying to outdo the other in terms of spending as little as possible, producing waste and inferior products. Capitalist production is directly responsible for the environmental crises caused by overproduction and the use of cheap, dangerous materials or methods. To generate more profit, wages are constantly under threat of being lowered. The capitalist society becomes profitable and ""stable"" by paying the workers as little as possible while providing just enough to keep them from revolting.

Replacing Old Plumbing
Any plumbing problem can happen with any plumbing pipes in your house. Like all building materials, your plumbing pipes will eventually wear out and have to be replaced. If you find yourself repairing leaky, corroded pipes every few months, it may be time to consider replacing the old system entirely – and soon. A corroded water pipe that bursts while you are away can cost you many thousands of dollars in damage to wall surfaces, framing members, and furnishings.
Identifying the materials used in your plumbing system can also tell you if replacement is advised. If you have galvanized steel pipes, for example, it is a good bet that they will need to be replaced in the near future. Most galvanized steel pipes were installed before 1960, and since steel pipes have a maximum life expectancy of 30 to 35 years, such a system is probably living on borrowed time. On the other hand, if your system includes copper supply pipes and plastic drain pipes, you can relax; these materials were likely installed within the last 40 years, and they are considerably more durable than steel, provided they were installed correctly.
Unless you live in a rambler with an exposed basement ceiling, replacing old plumbing nearly always involves some demolition and carpentry work. Even in the best scenario, you probably will find it necessary to open walls and floors in order to run new pipes. For this reason, replacing old plumbing is often done at the same time as a kitchen or bathroom remodelling project, when wall and floor surfaces have to be removed and replaced. 
Partial plumbing replacement involves replacing only those sections of your plumbing system that are currently causing additional plumbing problems. This is a quick, less expensive option than a complete renovation, but it is only a temporary solution. Old plumbing will continue to fail until you replace the entire system.
Complete plumbing replacement of all plumbing lines is an ambitious job, but doing this work yourself can save you thousands of dollars. To minimize the inconvenience, you can do this work in phases, replacing one branch of the plumbing system at a time. If you are inexperienced with plumbing repairs, we suggest calling your local London Plumber for more information.

No, you need to start reading.  The Soviet Union lost 12 to 14 million civilians, and 9 to 11 million military personnel.  Since pretty much all the Jews killed in the Holocaust were civilians, I think the relevant statistic is civilian fatalities.  There's a moral difference between killing a combatant who's trying to kill you as well, and killing a civilian who cannot fight back.

There are two separate crimes here, which combine to turn the ""normal"" brutality of war into genocide.  There's the killing of a person - this is equally bad regardless of the identity of the individual, be they Chinese, or American, or Icelandic, or Jewish.  Then there's the killing of a *people*, the attempt to destroy an ethnic or cultural group.  Here's where the percentages do kinda matter.  It would be a horrible crime to kill, say, 6 million Han Chinese civilians.  It would be a worse crime to kill those 6 million people just because they're Han Chinese.  But doing so doesn't really put the Han Chinese as a group in danger, because there are so many Han Chinese.  The same cannot be said for killing 6 million European Jews - most of the European Jewish communities, especially in Eastern Europe, are still devastated from the Holocaust.

My only contention with focusing too much on ""transcend and include"" is that it too easily forms into a linear conception of development over time, without taking the rhythmic, *expansive* and *contractive* dimensions into evolution. Will post more thoughts after this:

&gt; **PLAYBOY**: But aren’t there corresponding gains in insight, understanding and cultural diversity to compensate detribalized man for the loss of his communal values?

&gt;**McLUHAN**: Your question reflects all the institutionalized biases of literate man. Literacy, contrary to the popular view of the “civilizing” process you’ve just echoed, creates people who are much less complex and diverse than those who develop in the intricate web of oral-tribal societies. Tribal man, unlike homogenized Western man, was not differentiated by his specialist talents or his visible characteristics, but by his unique emotional blends. The internal world of the tribal man was a creative mix of complex emotions and feelings that literate men of the Western world have allowed to wither or have suppressed in the name of efficiency and practicality. The alphabet served to neutralize all these rich divergencies of tribal cultures by translating their complexities into simple visual forms; and the visual sense, remember, is the only one that allows us to detach; all other senses involve us, but the detachment bred by literacy disinvolves and detribalizes man. He separates from the tribe as a predominantly visual man who shares standardized attitudes, habits and rights with other civilized men. But he is also given a tremendous advantage over the nonliterate tribal man who, today as in ancient times, is hamstrung by cultural pluralism, uniqueness and discontinuity — values that make the African as easy prey for the European colonialist as the barbarian was for the Greeks and Romans. Only alphabetic cultures have ever succeeded in mastering connected linear sequences as a means of social and psychic organization; the separation of all kinds of experiences into uniform and continuous units in order to generate accelerated action and alteration of form — in other words, applied knowledge — has been the secret of Western man’s ascendancy over other men as well as over his environment.

&gt;**PLAYBOY**: Isn’t the thrust of your argument, then, that the introduction of the phonetic alphabet was not progress, as has generally been assumed, but a psychic and social disaster?

&gt;**McLUHAN**: It was both. It try to avoid value judgments in these areas, but there is much evidence to suggest that man may have paid too dear a price for his new environment of specialist technology and values. Schizophrenia and alienation may be the inevitable consequences of phonetic literacy. It’s metaphorically significant, I suspect, that the old Greek myth has Cadmus, who brought the alphabet to man, sowing dragon’s teeth that sprang up from the earth as armed men. Whenever the dragon’s teeth of technological change are sown, we reap a whirlwind of violence. We saw this clearly in classical times, although it was somewhat moderated because phonetic literacy did not win an overnight victory over primitive values and institutions; rather, it permeated ancient society in a gradual, if inexorable, evolutionary process.

A rough and dirty explanation for you: Jews, since well before the time of Jesus had not had a homeland. They were a people held together by their religion, but did not have a place of their own since biblical times. They were always considered the ""other,"" a minority that had always called themselves the ""Jewish People"" in stead of a member of their respected monarchy/empire.

Then came the age of Christianity, who among other things, directly blamed the Jewish people for killing their messiah and refusing to convert to what they believed to be the new and superior religion. Remember: a driving force for Christianity is the call to spread their faith to all corners of the earth.

One thing that is important to understand though is that anti-semitism only came into existence in the mid to late 1800's as Jews across Europe started to become emancipated. Prior to that it was different, it was blind Jew Hatred.

I guess you could define anti-semitism as being a movement based on racial theory.

I am in a bit of a bind here. I am part of a student group at a Canadian university in which we're building a zero emission hydrogen fuel cell vehicle to race internationally. My position is head of Corporate Relations, essentially obtaining sponsorship for our project (~$300,000 total per car), and until yesterday things had been running very smoothly. 

Myself and a couple of other students prepared the content for a sponsorship package, although the visual aspects of the packages were passed off to a graphic/industrial design student. Over the past 9 weeks we've been perpetually promised a draft of said package, which has never came, and we've thus pushed back the deadline. The last deadline was supposed to be April 24th, but as I found out yesterday, not only had they not started it, but they were going to be in Europe on vacation for the next 3 weeks, so there was zero chance of even getting it before the end of April.

Without this package we essentially have to push back our meetings with potential corporate sponsors a full month if we rely on this irresponsible student who was previously working on this, so we've decided to give it our best shot internally. I've decided that Adobe InDesign is likely a good place to start, although I'm lacking the creativity to get the initial layout down.

I recall actually ON the Honda MAC, we were going a steady but reasonably rapid pace which, for my skills-set at the time was toward my upper end. We were passed on a long straight by a guy on an R1 and two blades - one early, and going by the tail probably a fox-eye, and the other was contemporary. They were so late on the brakes past my instructor just to make it past him that they were dangerously close to not making the bend. And they then held us up slightly around a sequence of corners. The next straight they were stretching their legs.

The instructor's voice came over the radio telling me to ""follow the signs to Wensleydale, then the brown signs for the tea rooms... I'm going to have some fun..."" and he set off after them. At one point as the road swept a certain way down then up and around some bends, I saw him draft past them with ease. In a Pan European laden with first aid kit, radio gear, course literature, and so on. Awesome sight and helped the penny drop that doing what he was teaching me and doing it right, it didn't matter what I rode so much, because I could be smoother and faster than most, and still be a hell of a lot safer.  Taught me SO much. And put it into good use too :)

I've had fun on track, but wouldn't want to do it all the time. Fun to learn a bit more about the bike at closer to its (and my) limits, in relative safety, but in the end it's just getting pissed off as someone with more power and torque blasts past on a straight, then gets in the way wobbling round a corner.

In the car I've not had formal training beyond the basic test, but a friend at the gym I went to in my late teens was a traffic officer and he used to teach me a bit now and then when the chance arose. Things like when it snowed once, he called me up said ""Borrow your parents car, pick me up, we're off to have some fun"". So in a rattly old Montego we went off to a brand new supermarket's car park, nearly midnight, and had our private skid pan to teach me on. Lots of other examples too but I won't bore you with them. I was VERY lucky to have him as a friend. I'll miss him :(  (died of cancer about 7 years ago).

HGV driving is pretty good, too, in a way, for the skills on bike and in car. There's a LOT you learn about handling through those big old monsters that don't seem relevant but you break things down and you can figure much out. And also oddly enough it teaches you that slowly slowly catchy monkey, and that you can have fun without going nutso warp speed. So you can go slower, save fuel, and get to your destination just as quick by planning your drive better on the go... and so discipline becomes a sort of game to play on the go.

The skills for reading the road on a bike and in a truck aren't that dissimilar, and even things like speed management too. On top of the MAC course, for sure becoming a trucker improved my riding skills too.  (That sounds bizarre, I know!)

2.  I think I finally understand the source of our disagreement.  I don't view the ASPO graph as unrealistic.  It is what you and I deduce from that graph, and the assumptions we use for those deductions, that cause us to disagree.

You see the graph, and you see a gradual decline, which is a reasonable thing to see.  I see the graph, and I think in economic terms, namely supply and demand.  Even if we assume demand matches supply at present (it won't, it will continue to grow), we have a situation where each passing year means a further separation of supply and demand.  This means a *continually* increasing price of oil.  No more plateaus.  This means a completely halted economy because the cost of producing anything that requires oil and the cost of transporting anything becomes prohibitively expensive.

You might point to this as confirmation that alternatives will be priced into feasibility.  I would disagree.  If the price of energy from any source were, for example, twice what we pay now, that would cause all of our discretionary income to be redirected to energy.  That simply results in a permanent depression.  

&gt;it is an article that asks us to imagine the oil supply suddenly being cut to zero which I think is unrealistic

I agree.  My point of disagreement with you is that you see this wonderful 25+ year horizon where the market will magically find a cure.  It is my position that the decline (and subsequent price increase) of oil will happen too quickly for market adaptation.",t5_2qhw9,False,1427110871,t3_h0qfc,True

The hardest part of your question is to balance between stopping in one place and taking the time to see &amp; appreciate it well vs driving lots to superficially see lots of places. I'll put up some suggestions and let you work it out from there.

* You are in luck with the Autumn tree display. The European trees in many parts of Canberra have changed to yellows, reds &amp; browns. The leaves should stay on for another week, in time for you to catch them.

* There is the [National Zoo &amp; Aquarium](http://nationalzoo.com.au/) in Canberra. It isn't big on Australian animals, so I wouldn't make it a priority.

* The [Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve](http://www.tams.act.gov.au/play/pcl/parks_reserves_and_open_places/national_parks/tidbinbilla_nature_reserve) might be more your thing. It has emus, kangaroos, koalas &amp; other native animals.

* I love [Kosciuszko National Park](http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/nationalparks/parkhome.aspx?id=N0018). In your circumstance, I would recommend catching the chairlift up [Thredbo ski resort](http://www.thredbo.com.au/) and walking to Mt Kosciuszko, the highest peak on the Australian mainland. Make sure you take adequate clothing. At this time of year you could easily get caught in a snow storm. There is accommodation at Thredbo (too much to link to - just Google it).
Thredbo is about a 3 hour drive from Canberra. You will mostly be going through the Monaro plain, which is a lot like the area in the lee of the (big mountain range in NZ) such as Lake Tekapo. It is dry, generally treeless and rolling.

* There are several national parks within a few hours drive of Canberra. Morton National Park, Namagdi National Park, the Brindabellas, to name a few.

* Bateman's Bay is the nearest coastal town, at about 2 1/2 hours drive away. It is a river outlet and the beach is unremarkable. For beaches, head North or South for about 1/2 hour and stop when you see something nice. When I was last at [Pebbly Beach](http://maps.google.com.au/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Pebbly+Beach,+New+South+Wales&amp;aq=0&amp;sll=-25.335448,135.745076&amp;sspn=50.244513,72.246094&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Pebbly+Beach+New+South+Wales&amp;z=14), a long time ago, there was a lawn that was kept mown by the friendly Eastern Gray kangaroos.

&gt; Recommendations for car hire companies?

The national brands in Canberra are Avis, Budget, Hertz &amp; Europcar.
There are also local companies, if you want to give them a go.
[Yellow Pages](http://www.yellowpages.com.au/search/listings?clue=car+hire&amp;locationClue=Canberra+ACT&amp;x=45&amp;y=19) will give you a start. I don't hire cars often enough to recommend one company over another, so will need to do your own research on that bit.

Of course not. What I'm saying is that it was never done in my country the first place. Do you think circumcision was something all humans did at some point and eventually grew out out of? 

Let me tell you a bit about the history of this practice: 

The tradition of circumcision your people cherish and enjoy today started somewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, where many different forms of bodily mutilation have been practiced by different tribes for many different reasons. 

Whether through war, trade or slavery this practice reached Egypt where it acquired religious significance. Where further south male circumcision was done as rite of passage for all young men, it now became a religious ceremony where only the priesthood and the highest echelons of society were circumcised in exchange for secret prayers and rituals. 

From Egypt circumcision spread to the people of the Levant and eventually the Israelites who would bring this wonderful gift to the the Western world. Keep in mind that the two major lineages, so to speak, of circumcision that exist today diverged a very long time ago. The people of the Middle East were already practicing circumcision before Islam and continued to do so after. Where the Jews brought circumcision to Britain and from there to the rest of the commonwealth countries—The United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa—Islam spread it all throughout Africa, Southern Europe and as far east as Indonesia. 

Today circumcision has almost disappeared in most of the secular West with the exception of the United States, but remains as popular as ever in the Muslim world. Even in the US the rate of circumcision is currently estimated to be as low as 30% percent, though those figures do not count circumcisions not paid through insurance; the actual numbers are anywhere between 30% and 50%. So while it is true that the practice will probably have diet out by the end of the century, even in the cut-happy US, millions of boys will still have been victimized. I strongly believe any path that accelerates this trend is worth pursuing. 

When the Chinese attempted to ban foot binding, the people were so reluctant that the authorities actually had to threaten those that continued doing with death. Obviously I'm not advocating that approach but I think this shows you just how attached people can be to their traditions, no matter how unspeakably cruel.

As an addendum: there is actually another completely isolated lineage of circumcision practiced by Australian and New Guinean aborigines. These people also practice some of the most horrific types of male genital mutilation, including subincision—where the penis is cut open along the urethra like a fileted fish.

It's been around for a couple years, and waved about by the same crowd who claims that a Liberal government agreed to a ""North American Union in 2005.

It's someone's fantasy US currency that someone else Photoshopped some NAU labels onto.  You can find them elsewhere on the web in higher resolution.  It's easier to see what was on the original bills, and what was Photoshopped in later.

First, the people, buildings and original-color symbols are all strictly American.  Any common Canada/Mexico/US currency would have either country-neutral imagery or a combination of imagery from each country.   The seal with the eagle, stars and stripes, the pyramid with the Eye of Providence, even the font for the denomination - those are all strictly American currency imagery.  Even setting aside all the other MAJOR show-stoppers for a common currency, there's no way Canada or Mexico could approve those designs.

Second, America itself would never replace the Presidents on the currency with American Federal Reserve founders.  If Canada had to replace its currency's Prime Ministers and monarch, it wouldn't be for another country's leaders - so it most certainly wouldn't do it for another country's lesser bureaucrats.  

Third, a common currency by definition means *scrapping* the Federal Reserve - any common currency would be jointly managed by all three countries.  This makes putting the founders of the Fed on the currency, and an image of the signing of the Federal Reserve Act on the back of the $1 note, a rather silly idea.

Then there’s the name of this union. There could be more than one common name, but ONLY the official name would be on the currency. The front of this note says “The United Federation of North America”. The back says “The North American Union”. The small print says “Union of the North American Republic”. Pick ONE. (And an EU style union is still separate countries. It’s NOT a republic.)

For all the claims about an ""Amero by 2007!!!"", the conspiracy theorists have yet to identify a single politician in the US or Canada who wants it.  They've yet to find any sign of legislation for it coming down the pipeline in any country.  They've yet to come up with credible reasoning why Canada would adopt it at the best of times, let alone when the US has been committing economic suicide.

I point you the source aggrigator (sp?) wikipedia for a listing of all cellular telecoms in this ""grand ol' country"". 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_wireless_communications_service_providers

Now, carefully, look at the list for all GSM providers. Every single one of them with the exception of T-Mobile and AT&amp;T have a combined total of less than 2 million subscribers (TrakPhone actually USES all carriers lines and towers). AT&amp;T has roughly 97 million and T-Mobile has 33.7 million. They are also the ONLY providers of NATIONWIDE coverage for GMS phones, period. If you were to allow this merger you would actually allow ALL nationwide GSM service in the country to be held under one roof. GSM currently is the only cellular technology in the US that allows its subscribers the freedom of moving of one carrier to another with their purchased phone. CDMA (the opposing technology) locks its user's phone to their current subscribed company. As such, if someone wanted to switch to another company, they would have to purchase new hardware. It is also the only US cellular service that works worldwide as GSM is the European standard, with a current subscriber base of 1.5 billion users world-wide.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM

You cannot use CDMA phones in 70 percent of the world. AT&amp;T would be the only national provider in the US of GSM based international phones. Completely, and absolutely; to price however they see fit for over HALF of the entire countries cellular phone users, not to mention 40 percent of the entire countries population PERIOD. At 130 million customers... one hundred and thirty million US citizens would only one choice of provider for their preferred choice in cellular technology.

How can we as the United States of America show the strength of our economic system of choice, if we allow the basics of that system to be broken, and weakened in the name of political motivation and lobbying? The FCC is there for the protection of the people, and not once in this decade and possible century will proof of this be more evident than in this instance. 

Do NOT allow this merger to happen. Prove to this countries citizens that the FCC is not swayed by lobbyists and political beliefs. That the FCC is for the people, by the people, with the people. """,t5_2qlqh,False,1427111325,t3_h04zw,True

Look into big name tourist attractions as well as not so big name attractions.  Figure out where and which places you want to go and then prepare your plan around that.  May I also suggest not to go with a tourist company's pre-made plan because then it is *their* trip, not *your* trip.  However, don't hesitate to take a look at them for ideas for destinations.  Have a pretty good idea as to what your accommodations will be and if there may be any major events that would make it hard to acquire somewhere to sleep safely.

Make sure let your family and friends know your travel plans so you can ""check in"" along the way.  Report in if you're making changes on the fly or if you think you won't be able to ""check in"" for a while.  That way they'll know for sure that you're ok and even follow along with your travels.  If, worst-case scenarios, something bad happens, you've left a trail.  Family and friends will know where you are and be able to mobilize help in the right location, perhaps even helping you return home early.

Something I just thought of is to also figure out with your family/friends as to where you can send things.  You'll likely come across a lot of souvenirs and I'm sure you don't want to carry them all with you the entire trip.  A couple of days is no problem, but since you're going for a couple of months it may be something you'd want to look into.

Get plug adapters.  Not only will you, most likely in Europe, come across AC power cycling that is different, the wall power outlets will be different.  Power cycling would be important for your electronics.

Invest in some language phrase books for locations that you plan on going to that don't predominantly speak English.  Another option would be a smart-phone application.  Analyze it, not only for its' phrase library, but also if it requires an internet connection.  There are some that are smaller, but is completely self-contained.  For my trip to Japan, I used the Japanese phrasebook from Lonely Planet.  Not only was it self-contained, it also had the phrases in written in Japanese kanji characters, romaji (the sounds of kanji spelled out in English alphabet), **AND** a short audio clip that says the phrase.  I highly recommend it.

For computer security, may I suggest using the Firefox addon HTTPS-Everywhere.  It's not an end-all-be-all security since not all sites support https and, if I remember correctly, automatically notify you of a suspect internet connection.

&gt; Liquid showed interest, but EG chose not to accommodate us.

&gt; Ah, perspective!

Colbi:

&gt; Despite every European team agreeing to the ruleset without any concern, Team Liquid requested we make a rule that forced teams to alternate between servers from game to game for NA/EU and NA/KR matches. Since no European team issued this concern other than Team Liquid, we did not feel it appropriate to impose the rule on everyone which would just further complicate scheduling and broadcasting. Additionally, it should be noted that our ruleset did and does allow teams to play on either BattleNet region if both teams agree upon it.

LiquidTyler:

&gt; Every competition has some tension between accommodating players and minimizing the difficulty of running the tournament. Running good competitions is time consuming and difficult and frustrating so it is absolutely necessary to set limits on accommodating players.

&gt; One big issue is the server that games are being played on. TL.net, via the TSL, has publicized the best known solution for handling server issues with fairness to the players: For NA vs NA, play on NA, for EU vs EU, play on EU, for KR vs KR, play on KR. For NA vs EU, and NA vs KR, switch between servers for games. For KR vs EU, play all games on NA. Despite leading by example, TL has failed to popularize this solution, as it's apparently too difficult for any other online competition to implement.

&gt; Well at some point, players have to draw the line. But it's hard to do. The options for the players are playing in a $10k league with unfair conditions or not playing at all. There is not another $10k league that provides fairer conditions and is incompatible with EG's league. So you can conclude very little from European teams' willingness to participate. But I think you might get a little bit of insight into how EG operates: is it good enough for us to pull it off? Yep, ok, all done! It's like the guy in school who is aiming to pass rather than get top marks. It's not failing, but it is what it is.

&gt; If any guys in charge are reading this now: I'm pretty damn sure you didn't intend to run a $10k team league that Liquid would choose to not participate in. But post your threads and gather your views on teamliquid.net anyway, all while falling pitifully below the standard that teamliquid.net itself sets for running online competitions. I hope the viewers can recognize the difference. I hope more players can find themselves in a position to demand the highest standards rather than saying yes to everything that meets their lowest standards.

InControl:

&gt; TSL had a huge population of korean invites (so it makes sense to accommodate koreans/KR server)

&gt; EG MC has 1 team with people on the kOR server and even then it isn't their whole team. Excluding Sen EVERY OTHER PLAYER is from NA/EU which has 10x better connection than korea.

&gt; Why would the majority (VAST MAJORITY) take a hit to the benefit of TL and it's few players in korea?

&gt; A NA team hosts a tourney on the NA server where it's casters/teams are mostly located and TL asks for an unreasonable exception and then slanders EG... not your finest moment Tyler.

Not because it was or wasn't a long time ago, but because sweeping through an entire region of the world and slaughtering an entire group of people is wrong. It was wrong then, and it would be equally wrong now.

Fucking Judged.

But why do we drag it up? Because if you don't learn from histories mistakes, you will be fucked by it - hard. Do you seriously want to dismiss the holocaust of European Jews just because it was something from the last century, really? Oh, but those people were gassed a long time ago, better consider it in the context of that culture. Fuck that. You want to know why people bring these things up? It's because if allowed there are STILL people that would gladly fire up the gas chambers for a few. Maybe not someone you know, but maybe it would be. Considering the low opinion most christians have about atheists, don't think for a second that you wouldn't make the ""who to gas"" list.

&gt; I try to respect ppls' beliefs and I would never try to take someone's faith away from them

Beliefs do not deserve respect. Something is either true or it is not. If someone cannot clearly demonstrate why something is true, then there is a pretty good chance that they are wrong. If someone believes in little green space men sending them subliminal messages through their hairdryer then I don't need to respect their belief. I will call them a nut case, because that is what they are. Yet for some reason if we replace the little green space men with a dead jewish guy from the bronze age, and we replace the hairdryer with prayer, then suddenly their belief deserves respect? Nope. I'll still think they are a loon. If they try to excuse their belief as ""just something I was brought up with"" then they are fucking weak. They haven't asked the right questions, they haven't challenged easily refutable claims, and they are dishonest with themselves. I don't respect intellectual cowards for not challenging the stories of desert nomads. Want to take away a Christian's faith? Motivate them to read their bible from cover to cover. Nothing will make a stronger atheist than a careful reading of scripture. The bible celebrates slavery, abuse and oppression of women, and the genocide of rival nations. It is more depraved than the foulest pornography, and more violent than the bloodiest hollywood film. It is a book filled with pointless killing, and foolish superstition. Fuck their god, their books, and their beliefs. There is no room for it in modern civilization.

But what about the moderates?

A moderate christian exists only by ignorance of their own religion. Fundamentalists are only a problem for modern civilization because the fundamentals of christianity are completely absurd. Same thing for Islam - a billion moderates, and a few extremists that read and understood their holy books.

&gt;  I know a lot of bad things have been done in the name of various faiths, but I think that bad and mad ppl will be bad and mad, no matter what faith they have or don't have and any religious community is too diverse to make any sweeping statements. 

There is strong correlation between dysfunctional society and religion. The most religious places in the world enjoy their place at the bottom of the [human development index.](http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/)

&gt; slower wage growth

With all due respect I get the impression you know what you're talking about. I did have a degree in PPE, I spent 4 years studying Politics and Economics. I wrote many an essay on the reducing economic disparity. I wrote a paper on the rise of the left in Europe on the 90s, The UK Labour party between 1997 - 2005 reduced wage disparity by introducing a minimum wage (among other things) this in turn decreased poverty, lifting 500,000 young people out of poverty which in turn reduced crime, the economy also boomed during this time too.

The UK economy stalled in the late 2000s because Gordon Brown deregulated the banks, [he himself has admitted that he should have kept the markets more regulated](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/apr/13/gordon-brown-banking-sector-regulation)* as the Germans, who weathered the financial storm far better than any other European country did. 

There are no examples of a reduction of wealth disparity slowing wage growth.

The machine gun (which was over 50 by then) and artillery actually came of age with their roll in combat becoming forefront. Tanks were first used in battle, as were the first modern battleships. It was the advent of modern chemical warfare.

World War One was the mechanization of war. That is why it is interesting. New steam turbines powered battleships, tanks and tractors replaced horses, mud filled trenches replaced infantry lines, artillery fired for days on end pummelling fields into moonscape, all while airships bombed the cities of Europe. The industrial revolution allowed for the rapid production of large amounts of goods in a short amount of time. From bombs, to rifles, to tanks, to warships, all could be built in bulk. And if you lost those in battle, you could build some more. Add this to trench warfare and you get what amounts to hell on earth, as at some point it was forgotten that people aren't as replaceable as those goods.

I don't think we don't learn about WW1 cause its boring. WW2 has stories and tales, some of courage and others of loss. They make epic movies and great settings for games. This makes for an interesting and captivating read in book, and good watch on TV. WW1 doesn't have as many stories of courage or heroic deeds to capture the imagination. But it does have horrific accounts of what it is like to live in a hole dug in the ground filled with water and blood while the ground around you explodes and shakes. Or stories of how thousands of young men were sent wave after wave into enemy fire by incompetent commanders.

        No, no plans. The site was free for several years and will remain so for the foreseable future.
        Our philosophy is different to sites like rapidshare.com who do everything to annoy the user to pay up, we think providing a more compelling service with more features is a better choice and helps maintain the goodwill with our users.
    What are the upload file size limits?
        Guest User ~ 1000MB ! per file
        Free Registered User ~ 1000MB ! per file
        If uploading more than one file, the limit is per file, not the total
        These limits are subject to change, we used to have higher limits but it seems uploading / downloading very large files over HTTP is an unreliable process and its hard to make any guarantees above 100MB
        Premium accounts will probably have a higher upload file size, but not yet available
    How many files can I upload?
        As many files as you like :)
    Are there any download limits?
        Our bandwidth is shared between all users, so at peak times it might get slow, beside our best effort guarantee we can not promise anything to guest and free users
        Do note that speeds are fastest off-peak, between 24:00 and 12:00 GMT when there are alot of unused and wasted bandwidth.

        Our servers are in USA and EU so the people in those countries should get the faster speeds in theory.
        There are no download counters! and you can download all you want! Same as you could with mihd.net since 2006, though there is a CAPTCHA to stop automated requests if multiple downloads occur from the same location in short time.

    What is the relation between ifile.it and mihd.net?
        iFile.it is the replacement for mihd.net, checkout blog for more details

Another annoying phony-intellectual word I despise is ""anti-semite,"" which was coined by a German (who hated Jews, if IIRC), using it to exclusively mean 'against the Jews,' but using the biblical character Shem for its basis, who was supposedly the son that survived Noah's Ark during the flood in order to procreate the east race of Middle Eastern-Near Asians (which Jews are a part of), as distinct from the white brother Japheth and the black brother Ham, who supposedly populated Japhetic Caucasia and Europe and Hametic Africa (respectively). And most ironically, this silly word is now used primarily to distinguish between Middle Eastern Jews and their Arab neighbors who hate them, when really, they are all supposedly defendants of Shem and therefore all Semites, and therefore all pretty much incapable of being anti-Semitic.

It's pretty clear what it means: land to which Arabs are indigenous. If we take the definition of Arab to be those of Arabic tongue, then the entire of the Levant is Arab territory, including Muslim, Jewish, and Christian Arabs. 

&gt;It was given to the British by the League of Nations as the representative body of the world community with the express purpose of creating a Jewish State there

No.

&gt;Before the British held it, it belonged to the Ottoman Empire, a non-Arab state. 

Very misleading considering the Ottoman Empire was a multi-ethnic empire. It was neither Arab NOR non-Arab. The rulers being Turks had no bearing on its inhabitants. Palestine still consisted of Arabic speaker.

&gt;There have been Jews living in the land that is now Israel consistently for thousands of thousands of years, predating modern conceptions of statehood and predating most modern religions.

The majority of the Jews who made up the state of Israel immigrated after the loss of the Ottoman Empire, from Europe and Russia, as well as other nearby Arab and Iranian territories. The indigenous Palestinian Jews were always vastly outnumbered by either christians or muslims since the rule of Byzantium (more than 1500+ years ago).

&gt;The UN proposed a partition plan that gave the Jews very little in 1948. The Jews accepted and the Arabs rejected this plan.

The Jewish population was offered 55% of the land despite being only 30% of the population. Not to mention half of the state of Israel would've consisted of Arabs who never chose to reside in a foreign state imposed on them by the west.

 on wikipedia ffs: ""Many broadband Internet Service Providers in North America and Europe introduced bandwidth caps in the early 21st century. The same practice has been in place in Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and South Africa since the release of broadband.""

Many countries that don't have caps had heavy government investment into infrastructure (Eg Sweden , Korea, Japan). 

Usage habits differ considerably by country and this also influences pricing and supply.

The american situation is almost identical to the situation in Australia. The wholesale /spectrum sharing agreements are similar as is the ex government now privatised monopoly (in fact its more duopoly in the states - gone full circle after the baby bell antitrust breakup).  Its just we always had caps -  we also have to pay for international traffic - the first few unlimited plans went away as ISP's realised it was a bad idea (chello in NZ for example)- and as our infrastructure was upgraded the caps went up steadily. They have some unlimited plans here but only from isps with own infrastructure doing spectrum sharing -or buying the same from a wholesaler other than Telstra -  and its all relatively new and will be interesting to see how long they last given that they have never been very successful at turning a profit. Unlimited is a pipe dream - everyone ends up subsiding the leeches and demand is outstripping infrastructure and has done for a long time. Because its just not profitable enough for private enterprise to do it in the end and demand is increasing faster than newer faster networks are being rolled out. Hence NBN in australia. Only way we will get Japan style broadband here - like it or not.

Redditors can bitch all you want about greedy isp's - its not going to change the reality.  It just took a while to happen in the states. And you can blame the leeches mostly.

Actually they not

After Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007, Israel announced the freezing of the Crossings Agreement. **The Palestinian force that operated the crossing on behalf of the Palestinian Authority was unable to reach the crossing due to Hamas' control of the Gaza Strip**. Israel objected to opening the crossing on the grounds that it was unable to monitor the persons passing through it, and **Egypt closed the border since it was impossible to implement the Crossing Agreement**. **The European force also stopped its monitoring activities due to the European Union's refusal to cooperate with Hamas**. As a result, since June 2007, the crossing has not been opened in accordance with the Crossings Agreement. **Egypt, which can open the crossing on its side, generally refrains from doing so**, thereby becoming a partner in Israel's siege policy.

Yeah, they are amazingly brave. Read the Wiki article on Gao Zhisheng

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gao_Zhisheng#Detentions

&gt; Detentions
&gt;
&gt; Amnesty International alleged on 17 January 2006 that Gao narrowly escaped an assassination attempt, planned as a traffic accident ordered by Chinese secret police.[6] On 4 February 2006, Gao, together with Hu Jia and other activists, launched a “Relay Hunger Strike for Human Rights,” whereby different activists and citizens fasted for 24 hours in rotation. The hunger strike was joined by people in 29 provinces, as well as overseas, though several participants were arrested for joining.[10]
&gt;
&gt; On 15 August 2006, after numerous death threats and continued harassment, Gao disappeared while visiting his sister's family. On 21 September 2006, he was officially arrested.[11] On 22 December 2006, Gao was convicted of ""subversion"", and was sentenced to three years in prison, suspended, and placed on probation for five years. The sentence also deprives him of his political rights – the freedom to publish or speak out against the government – for one year. He had publicly confessed to a number of errors. On his liberation, Gao recanted his confession and described torture he said he experienced[7][12] during his 54 days[13] in custody. He also said captors threatened he would be killed if he spoke publicly about the matter.[7] In chapter 6 of his memoirs written in 2006, Gao criticised the CCP for employing ""the most savage, most immoral, and most illegal means to torture our mothers, torture our wives, torture our children, and torture our brothers and sisters…"". He formally renounced his membership of ""this inhumane, unjust, and evil Party"", declaring it ""the proudest day of my life.[14]
&gt;
&gt; The American Board of Trial Advocates selected Gao to receive the prestigious Courageous Advocacy Award; they had invited him to receive the award personally in Santa Barbara, California on 30 June 2007.[15]
&gt;
&gt; In the fall of 2007, Gao’s memoir A China More Just was published in English in the United States.[16]
&gt;
&gt; On 22 September 2007, after writing open letters to Vice-President of the European Parliament, Edward McMillan-Scott, and then to US Congress calling for a boycott of the Olympics,[17] Gao was once again taken away from his home, where he had been under house arrest, by Chinese secret police.[18] A letter from Gao claimed that he endured ten days of torture that involved beatings, electric prods and even toothpicks to his naked body, followed by weeks of emotional torture. Gao wrote that his torturers said his case had become personal with 'uncles' in the state security apparatus after he had repeatedly publicised previous mistreatment.[19]
&gt;
&gt;Disappearances
&gt;
&gt; In February 2009, Gao was taken away for interrogation by Chinese security agents[1] and had not been seen until[13] he resurfaced in Shanxi in March 2010. One month prior to his disappearance, Gao's wife and two children escaped China with the help of underground religious adherents. They arrived in the United States and were granted right of asylum ten days later.[7][8] During his disappearance, in response to queries from his family about his whereabouts, police claimed he lost his way and went missing in September 2009.[20][21] For several months, Gao was not charged, and the Government never acknowledged his whereabouts, nor their involvement in his disappearance. His last contact with friends or family was one phone call placed to his brother in July 2009.[19]
&gt;
&gt; In January 2010, Gao's brother, Gao Zhiyi, told an interviewer that the Beijing police told him that Gao ""lost his way and went missing"" on 25 September 2009,[22][23] igniting fears that Gao was no longer alive.[24][25] On 21 January 2010, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a cryptic statement that Gao was “where he should be,” [26][27] and said he did not know Gao's whereabouts at a later press conference.[7] During the visit to China by David Miliband in March, the Chinese foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, said that Gao had been sentenced on subversion charges, but denied he had been tortured.
&gt;
&gt; On 28 March 2010 Gao was found to be living near Wutai Mountain. Addressing a reporter by telephone, he said he was not in a position to be interviewed, but confirmed he had been sentenced and freed.[28] A few days later, he met the media, appearing thinner and more subdued than in the past and said that he had abandoned his criticism of the government in the hope of reuniting with his wife and two children, who secretly fled China early last year.[29]
&gt;
&gt; In April, 2010 Gao's family reported they have not heard from him since he returned from a visit to Xinjiang 10 days previously.[30] The South China Morning Post reports that Gao left Beijing to visit his in-laws in Urumqi, carrying just a backpack between 9 and 12 April. Gao's father-in-law said Gao arrived at his house in the company of four police officers, spent just one night there before once again being taken away by police. His father-in-law called a friend of his in Beijing on 21 April to say Gao was to board a plane at 4.30 p.m. His father-in-law said Gao had promised to call after returning home, but there was no word.[31] Emily Lau and Albert Ho said Gao's disappearance ""prov[ed] that justice and the rule of law is disappearing in communist China – if it ever existed at all"".[32]
&gt;
&gt; The report of Gao's 2010 disappearance and detention was considered by the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention which, in March, 2011, called for his release.[33]

So basically anyone that stands up for people's rights under the Chinese constitution can expect to be arbitrarily detained, tortured and eventually disappeared if they don't stop. 

But the amazing thing is that despite all that people like Li Fangping still do it. In fact there's a movement called the Weiquan movement which is essentially dedicated to defending people's rights under the Chinese constitution.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weiquan_movement

It's a curious situation really - on paper what they are doing is legal. In practice the secret police try to intimidate them into stopping and if all else fails disappears them.

Which was made into a PBS documentary: [The Prize](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278873/).

IIRC, the British found the oil in the Middle East.  But, as their international influence wained post WWII, and the Soviet Union's grew, the U.S. took up the reigns of the British in the Middle East.  So, essentially, the US inherited the Middle East from the British.

The British got the Middle East so that they could build the Suez Canal, among other things.  They had an empire to run, and most of the money was in India and China, and the Middle East is along the way to both of those places.

Trivia: Israel was formed in what was, at the time, known as ""British Palestine.""

The US pioneered the Oil economy.  The world's first big oil fields were in western Pennsylvania.  Then there were the big fields in Texas, and later Mexico and Venezuela.

Which was all well and good for the U.S., but the folks in Europe realized that they were in trouble as the Oil economy was pushing the US well ahead of everyone else.  So, the British went and found oil in the Middle East.  The Dutch found oil in the ""East Indies"", known to you as Indonesia (EDIT: and to me as the Philippines).  The French built nuclear power plants out the wazoo, and, once the US had fucked up in (and generally fucked up) Iran, made friendly with the Iranians.

The Soviets made friendly with the Egyptians (who do you think built the dams on the Nile, which, BTW, have completely fucked the Nile river valley's ecology, and therefore Egypt economy), and pretty much anyone who would give them the time of day.

So, the Israeli's leverage the Soviet influence and a general ""sorry about the genocide"" attitude into massive financial aid from the US, which pisses off everyone else in the Middle East, since the Israelis are, in effect, an invader.  Besides, what better way to distract your peeples from your atrocities than you screech about the evil Israelis?  (You can tell when shit is going down in Tehran, because that's when Ahmadinejad will show up in the international press talking about vaporizing Israel.)

But, after forty or fifty years, the peeples start asking why you haven't defeated the Israelis in glorious battle, so you point the finger at the US and its support of Israel.

Meanwhile, over in Saudi Arabia, dissidents are also pointing out how chummy the royal family is with the US.  (The Saudi Arabian royal family really is quite fond of the US, for obviou$ rea$on$.)  So, the US is The Bad Guys.  (In some ways, the US really is the bad guys, but not in the way most terrorist think.)

So, when you get tired of talking young people into blowing themselves up in Israel, you talk some of them into flying planes into buildings in the US.

Shit goes down in the US, and you know somebody is going to get bombed.  So, Afghanistan gets bombed, because Osama, a Saudi Arabian, who talked a bunch of Saudi Arabians into attacking the US, is hiding there, and the US can't very well bomb Saudi Arabia, now can it?  That goes over so well, the Taliban in general get vilified, and US troops are suddenly ""liberating"" Afghanistan from the Afghanistanis.

(Take a break to go read ""[Flashman](http://books.google.com/books?id=uyUyfgelXVEC&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=flashman&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)"" by George MacDonald Fraser.  Hilarious satire, it also gives a nice description of the British defeat in Afghanistan.  What?  The British?  Yep.  The British, the Soviets, now the US.... Afghanistan is sometimes called ""Where Empires go to die."")

How Iraq got thrown into the mess is still a little cloudy.  It will be interesting to see what history decides.  It might have just been part of Darth Chaney's retirement plan.  More likely it was the start of a larger strategy to encircle, then strangle Iran.  Check out this map of the [Middle East](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/maps/refmap_middle_east.html).  What borders Iran to the east?  What borders it to the west?  Do the math.

"".

Also, keep in mind that it's not just about the oil *reserves*.  It's also about all the oil that's already been sucked out of the ground, because that all turned into big piles of cash.

If someone from Africa drew a stick figure it'd be an African male from their region, ect ect. 

Given no clues we default to our culture's ""normal"" and only assume otherwise if there is clear reasons showing it, so no one in japan NEEDS to draw super Japanese features for people to know that the cartoons are Japanese people.

It (edit: democratic socialism) ~~also refers to~~ (edit: often times goes together with) [social capitalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capitalism). Germany practices this, Australia as well. Germany believes no company or entity should become too powerful and thus they try to create competition **which allows for free market forces to come into effect**. We use to do such a thing as well in the United States when we use to break up monopolies not too long ago. 

Germany is extraordinarily wealthy and strong at this time because they know that by having companies compete it creates more wealth and less inefficiencies as well as promotes innovation.

Example of cell phones.. which is a good example for the EU example of forcing companies to compete.. they know that mandating free incoming calls (so not to double charge both the one initiating and then one receiving) they also have it so companies have to have quad band phones and that works no most all major providers (also mandates GSM). You can swap sim cards if you don't like your current carrier without ditching your phone. Here there are built up barriers to prevent you from switching (2 year contract, different phone communication standards, many frequencies that are not shared). That might not be a 100% accurate picture (for instance I don't know of they necessarily share spectrum for sure) but that is well documented in how they force competition and put some small smart regulations on the market to force competition. 

But in the case of other countries and internet access. US pays huge amounts of money to companies to subsidize their roll out of broad band. Other countries either built it out directly themselves or do the same thing, pay to have it built out by companies. But THEN they force line sharing so ISP's compete on those lines. If the lines are owned by a company (and say that company is also providing services) they limit the amount that company can extort from those other ISP's as to not allow them to unfairly manipulate the competition to their advantage.

This also drives prices lower and instead of consumers spending money on products that , should free market forces really be in play, would be cheaper, they can spend it in other areas of the economy.",t5_2qgzg,False,1427112206,t3_h1kem,True

* Describe my 20's: When I graduated with my B.S., I felt really lost. I had been ""groomed"" (for lack of a better word) to go to graduate school. Finished top of my class (literally) at an extremely tough engineering school, completed 3 undergraduate research projects, 2 internships, etc. But I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life and whether grad school was really what I wanted. I had many ""who am i?!?!"" moments.

    So...I did what everyone told me **not** to do and took a couple of years off to work in industry. I am so glad I did. I had so much fun those years being young and free from the pressure of school. I was able to take a step back and figure out what really mattered to me and what I wanted to do. When I finally applied to grad school, I did so knowing it was really what I wanted to do. I also fell in love with my [now] husband. We got married after my first year of grad school.

    The rest of my 20's was spent in grad school. studying. traveling. I finished my PhD at 29. All in all, it was a very tough decade and I learned a lot about myself and what I wanted from my life.


* My Goals: Get my PhD. Meet people. See as much of the world as possible.

* Interests: School, travel, outdoors, running, camping, hiking, friends, cooking/baking.

* Most exciting events: I challenged myself a lot to get out of my comfort zone. I travelled extensively in my 20's and many times I travelled alone. One memorable occasion, I was alone in Greece, near the Turkish boarder in a rental car doing field work (geology). I got a flat and the rental had nothing for a flat but a can of compressed air. sigh. I can't speak Greek or Turkish. Long story short, 10 hours later I had a new tire and was on my way. I had so many misadventures like this in my 20s traveling in Europe, Asia and Central America. I feel like they really challenged and stretched me and gave me confidence in myself.

* No regrets. I think even the ""mistakes"" were part of the learning process for me.


*Words of wisdom*

* Don't compare yourself to others. Everyone is different and does things differently. Be yourself, own who you are.

* Take risks. This is the time in your life to try new things. There aren't as many responsibilities or repercussions if those risks don't pan out. Along those lines, don't be afraid to fail. ""Trying does not guarantee results, but not trying will guarantee no results!""

* You will never regret doing the right thing.

* Life is too short for mean people and toxic relationships.

* Take advice with a grain of salt (even mine!). When someone says, ""Don't get married before 30"" or ""Don't wait too long to have kids!"" realize that they are summing up their own personal experiences. Everyone brings different things to the table so keep in mind personal bias when listening to advice. 

Each stage of life brings new challenges and changes. Enjoy your 20's and learn as much as you can about yourself in the process. :)

Just by sheer volume of numbers I don't need to ask the governments of the West ""How many people have you forced to shut up unofficially?"" because even if it was just 10% of the populace being black balled that's still 130 million people.

Gitmo is a fucking farce. The simple fact is that governments will *always* abuse their power, and some will do this more than others. I don't know a single person that's been silenced by some seedy government organisation or program, and while that doesn't mean it occurs it pretty much shows it doesn't happen very often.

I am absolutely sickened by people acting like people are being dragged out their houses daily and thrown against prison walls for making some scathing remark or voicing ""dangerous"" opinions on the internet. We quite simply don't live in an autocracy. We don't live in China.

Yes, certain governments will drown out things they don't want to hear and smear the names of those involved just like the oil industry done with global warming back in the day.

Also, while Guantanamo Bay has definitely unlawfully imprisoned innocent people I'd wager not all of them were just ""unlucky"" to be chosen.

We should be vigilant about when a government begins amassing too much power but we should also trust the people in charge to an extent. Hell, even Julian Assange is still allowed to openly address the world without censorship and he royally embarrassed and pissed off the West. If we had the type of governments who just ""silenced"" anyone who dared question the powers that be or discover something that they don't want you to hear he'd have been dead or in prison years ago.

Our governments fuck up sometimes, but the brilliant thing is that they're at least a *bit* more accountable to their actions than say Vladimir Putin, or Hu Jintao.

Here's what his death means for me:

I was in middle school when 9/11 happened. I remember the feeling of national unity that followed, and the subsequent abuse of that feeling by our country's executive to get us involved in a senseless war (I still remember getting into a debate with the AP European History teacher at my high school who insisted Iraq had WMDs, while I maintained that they did not. I also suspected at the time that the war was being waged so Bush could win the 2004 election, which now sounds a little far fetched to me. But hey, I was young and mostly right.) I remember the fear they stoked during the 2004 election. And now, we have a president who not only did away with the color coded fear system, but also one who was capable of reframing the issue in his address to the nation (""war on Al Qaeda"" instead of ""war on terror""). We have a president capable of putting the issue to rest.

His death marks a return to normalcy and a triumph of what a nation can achieve with a competent man in charge. 

I didn't take to the streets, but I can completely understand it. Osama was a piece of shit who made it his life's work to kill Americans indiscriminately, so yes, as an American, I'm pretty fucking happy he's dead.

Free pass? I didn't say that. I said that Europeans have no business looking down on America for it--especially considering they still practice it.

&gt;You didn't provide any evidence of Osama's significance. I really think the world stopped caring about him ~5 years ago.

The ""leader"" of the ""free world"" did not. He has been actively seeking his whereabouts and trying to execute him since taking office just as the last ""leader of the free world"" did. The ""world"" may have forgotten about him, the most economically &amp; militarily powerful country in it did not.

&gt;Your dig at European empathy by citing 'the common man's sense of closure' is risible. Should we bring policy and culture into line with Joe the Plumber's sensibilities so he can get closure? Get real.

This has nothing to do with ""joe the plumber"" it has to do with the deaths of over 2000 Americans on 9/11 and the deaths of thousands more during the war. You want evidence that he was significant? 300million Americans say so. That's all the proof anyone should need. Want more? Trillions of dollars were spent. Want more?

&gt;Your bombastic grand-standing about the American army's effectiveness is pathetic. You're like an obese sports fan taking personal credit for his national team's performance. To be completely honest, it just makes you sound really insecure.

I served in Vietnam. I don't give a shit if you think it's bombastic. Fact: If you attack this country, regardless of your nation of origin or present location we will kill you either by bullet or by noose and we will spare no expense in doing so. This isn't bragging. It's a fact.

&gt;The lack of honest debate in your country about the morality of foreign adventurism is genuinely tragic.

Read my post history if you want *my* opinion of foreign adventurism (i.e. military intervention) but this isn't about *my* opinion on that subject, it's about *my* opinion on European elitism.

&gt;As to this event as a cultural turning point for America, I think the opposite might be true. Look at the jeering, flag waving crowds. Do those people look less nationalistic, less petty, less approving of extreme measures? They don't to me.

By your logic then Palin should be elected and Obama will be destroyed in the following election. If, however, I am correct then you will see him reelected, a decrease in the American defense budget, and an increase in spending for social issues.

I can actually, honestly understand why a couple of firefighters or other people who lost friends, family members and coworkers during the attacks get some sense of closure (although if I may show my ignorance by resorting to something I know only from the Daily Show: the whole shebang about the healthcare bill for 9/11 first responders could potentially offer more fulfilling closure) from all this but when people start cheering ""USA! USA!"" in front of the White House for not much of a reason, it irks me a bit. Probably because the same people are very likely to otherwise adopt the apolitical ""all politicians are crooked bastards anyway"" stance and rile against ""big gubment"". Now that the bad guy killed the badder guy, the formerly bad guy is awesome for a while. It's just sad that this and not something constructive, something that actually helps people is being celebrated. But again, we Europeans just cheer the names of our countries when they win the World Cup, so we all have a stupid, shallow idea of politics and national pride/identity. 

And I googled Bin Laden a bit and came across an article on MSNBC which argued that Osama wasn't just not as wealthy as previously assumed so not even his fortune is particularly important and he's generally an old hat amongst the radicals. Maybe his death now reduces terrorism. Maybe not. We'll see. 

Also, don't glorify the US military - or any military for that matter. It took ten years and the most advanced military behemoth on this planet to track down a guy with a fucked up kidney. In the process, hundreds of thousands of civilians died, thousands of their relatives joined terrorist organizations (speaking of closure, what exactly do you expect some poor Middle Eastern schmuck to do after a Western bomb maimed his little sister? Where's the fucking empathy here? Why the fuck aren't we talking about the thousands of people we - and yes, by we I mean the Americans, the Brits, the Germans, everyone who participated in the war and supplied the war with resources - murdered? Why do we apply empathy selectively?) and the entire thing might have made the world less safe. I don't know. I really don't know if it was all worth it, in the long run. But the army doesn't do magic, after causing tons of collateral damage they finally got that one guy who may or may not have been important. Kudos to that. 

And I'll not go into a debate about whether terrorism justifies intervention but the problem I'm having is that it may have justified the clusterfuck that is the involvement in the Middle East. There was no reason to go after terrorists in Iraq but I can now see Osama's death being used to absolve that little adventure, too. Militarism as such could become more prominent as ""the continuation of politics by other means"" or however that quote goes. 

And no matter how important you think Osama may have been, the war won't end. Barack made that much clear - it will be a slow process. Al-Qaeda won't dissolve, people won't stop hating the West. Western ""imperialism"" will continue to breed hatred. Our lives will improve when we change our foreign policy, our politics and our polity.   

Look, if I come across as anti-American, it's because a) I'm actually ""anti-West"" and you folks are the figurehead for the West and b) we Europeans love to adopt your policies. After all, following your involvement in Iraq, the idea that protecting your county's ""interests"" by force, if necessary, became a little more popular around here, too. I don't want the world to become more of what it already is. That's probably why Barack was beloved here, too. American change would've been European change. Alas, it didn't happen.

I just think they're badly misguided, and are opening us up to a massive economic crisis (especially in a world where China will soon become the largest economy).

It's funny that people have blamed the wars (not that I believe that continuing them is a good idea) for the debt crisis. The wars are a fairly minor part of a much deeper crisis, we (and most of the first world) spend far too much of the GDP on transfer payments. We have a serious debt crisis, and neither side has the political will to make a real dent in the problem.

Hilariously, the Democrats are able to get away with saying we can fix the problem by taxing the top 1%. That just isn't possible for two main reasons.

First, the top 1% is very capable of taking its income and moving that money to non-U.S. sources. It's actually easy, just sell U.S. assets, use those funds to buy assets in Switzerland, Brazil, or any other rich friendly nation. Then move to any other country on earth, and don't pay the IRS ever again. There are downsides, but if we start taxing at European rates this will slowly start happening (with negative economic results). If you don't believe me, look at what's happened to California vs. Texas since one became a tax nightmare and one a tax haven.

Second, and more importantly, even if you confiscated 50% of the income of the top 1%, you'd still be in a deficit (increasing annually due to medicare and social security). For the last year we have data, the top 1% earned 20% of the income, and paid 38% of the federal income tax (23% tax rate, $400 Billion). Even if you could get $400 Billion more, you'd just put a dent in the deficit (debt currently increases by $4 Billion per day).",t5_2cneq,False,1427112997,t3_h22c8,True

Power is the ability to enforce one's will, through whatever means.  The more of that ability you have, the more power you have.

I don't claim to be ideology-free, however, I hope that my positions are well grounded in pragmatic observation.  I think Soros's ideology is similar.

I would argue that you need a measure of all three liberties, or you end up without any of them, and I would tend to focus most on (a) as being the form of liberty that the other two serve, in that without (a), the other two are moot, but with strong (b) and (c), societies will move toward (a).

With pure economic liberty, any positive feedback causes instability, and the system ends up with a concentration of economic power in a small number of hands.  With pure economic liberty, that concentration of power can destroy (a) if, for example, a small cohort decide that only one social group can eat at the lunch counter, or a certain minority aren't to be employed (I've seen market fundamentalists argue that this has to be allowed under freedom of association).  The only way to restrict that is to make sure that there is some degree of (c), so that wide disparities in power do not take hold.  Concentration of economic power also destroys (b), in that those who are outside the concentration of economic power that is allowed by (b) find their economic choices restricted, so even if technically, (b) is complete, practically, it is not.  The end result of too great an emphasis on (b) is eventually feudalism.  Think of it as a marble on top of a hill, if the marble goes too far one way, it rolls down the hill to a point where it will never get back up without an extreme application of outside force.  The deontologists argue that this doesn't matter, since the system, whatever its end state, was arrived at from what they consider to be morally valid premises.
 
I can find examples of people who claim that their emphasis is on (b) who argue that they shouldn't be forced to support public education, for example, because it gives other people's children an equal chance at economic success as their own children (Dinesh D'Souza has made precisely that argument).  This is the slope of the hill that the marble will roll down unless it is restricted.

Putting equality into the system as a value adds negative feedback, since it will rein in those concentrations of power that lead away from actual, empirical (b), rather than theoretical (b).  Of course, genuine equality will never exist in the real world, since everyone has different abilities and backgrounds.  But ensuring that *at a minimum* there is only an allowable range of inequality keeps a system meritocratic, and allows market forces to work as envisioned by Smith, instead of degenerating into a mass of oligopolies.

Whenever we see greater moves toward (b) and away from (c), we see those concentrations of power develop.  The libertarians argue that this is *only* because there isn't *more* (b), and that somehow, doing more of what is causing the problems will make it go away.

They also argue that enforcing (c) causes economic collapse, pointing at Communist systems as proof.  But since Communism as we've seen it had neither (a), (b), nor (c), that's a weak argument.

I believe that the moves toward increased (a) and (c) from the New Deal and the reconstruction of Europe were a large part of the half-century of affluence the Western world has seen.  The recent economic instability and crises we've had have been due to a 30-year move away from (c) toward (b).

&gt;Can you name anyone who believes (D)

There's a difference between believing (D) trumps all evidence, and a conditional belief in (D) based on evidence.  At some point, one has to have some *a priori* assumptions, but the safest course is to minimize their number and complexity, and constantly do a back-check on whether the results of those assumptions match observations.  The ideologue will not do that, that is what makes him an ideologue.  I think we can distinguish between having an ideology and being an ideologue by the degree to which facts on the ground affect the ideas in question.

Soros didn't just say ""youse guys is wrong and I'm right, ya heah me?"" he laid out a reasoned critique of a central assumption of a particularly dominant economic ideology (and I call it an ideology because of its denial of empirical facts).  Reisman, on the other had, said that Soros was wrong because he disagreed with Reisman.",t5_2r7mh,False,1427113150,t3_gzpdo,True

You are quite right, that we, Europeans, can sound a little condensending.
And that, we the dutch, have done more evil stuff in the past, than American has ever even been accused of.

In my book, Shell is up there with Haliburton. The mess they made in Nigera. These people likely have no moral standards what so ever. 

&gt;And the fact that the Netherlands is part of the western system of capitalism that is based at least in part on American military might.

Definately true. This is why we support you guys, even when we don't like what you are doing. It's not our place to obstruct, as an ally.

But, and this may sound weird, with that alliance, and with your government calling the shots; it sort of feels like you (the US) are representing the West; and we want you to. So when we critize you, we critize the leader we too elected. We didn't elect your president, but we did elect your country to lead our world.

So, in a way, when we critize the US, it feels like we are critizing our own 'supergovernment'. The leader of our world.

I'm angry because just a few posts ago you were whining about being a second class citizen when it's painfully obvious that the reverse is true.

Secondly, since Europeans have landed they've gone completely out of their way to make their lives miserable. This isn't some crap like, ""Oh, well it happened yesterday so like get over it."" More like over a couple hundred years little things like starvation, spreading disease, rape, abuse, displacement, forced sterilizations, forcibly removing thousands of our children from our homes without investigations to back it up, keeping us confined to reserves till only a few decades ago, and other boring uninteresting shit like that. As long as the government isn't trying to fucking kill them, they don't care about what it does and despite whatever fantasy world you live in that says government is noble and just, you simply aren't going to convince a people that have endured as much as them that this is the case. 

Those numbers are from the 2006 census Sherlock. 85% White, 10% visible minority, 5% Aboriginal. I'm also half white, so no, not all white people are the same, just a lot of them have the same perspective on Indians much like the r/canada in general. 

I also never said anything about ""EVIL WHITE CANADA"", I just don't like snobby non-aboriginals who plead unfairness without even realizing the full scope of the Indian experience. I'm only half indian not even living on the reserve and the experience for me is overwhelming a lot of the time. Death, despair, rape, and more. This doesn't happen to some stranger you know, it happens to my family. Cousins, uncles, aunts, sisters (at least the ones that survived). You would not believe the shit that I have been privy too but frankly, I don't really give a shit if you do understand. I ask for no pity, never have, never will.

Finally, the Indian Act. There's a world of difference between how it is written and how it is implemented. First off, our rights have been eroding consistently since it was written (newest revision was in the 1980's. Before that it was the British North American Act). It was supposedly based off of the treaties that were signed to guarantee the government of canada the vast majority of land and resources canadians now enjoy. That house that your mom has, your grandparents had, etc. is only yours because of those treaties or, as I prefer to recognize them, legal arrangements between sovereign nations. The government got trillions upon trillions of dollars worth of land and resources in exchange for a few meager rights for the descendants. As an Integrated Indian, I get fuck all. I don't have a home on the reserve. I pay property taxes. I pay income taxes for work I do off reserve. The only things I got were a decent education (of which I spent years on a wait list...not all of us are that fortunate) and some dental. Not really what I would call reason for a massive outrage or pretense to say that we all get our lives handed to us on a silver platter, but there it is. Bottom line is, no matter how much you whine that it isn't fair to poor middle class you, the sheer scope of what canada gained from these treaties exponentially outweighs what the treaties supposedly provide to us. Canada is legally obligated to provide the provisions of those treaties to us in exchange for the land and resources you enjoy.

Europe != France != Poland != UK != ... The only thing we really share is a common currency (excluding the UK). In general, we don't really feel united. Different languages, culture, heritage, religion, ...

&gt; Franco, Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, hundreds of years of imperial expansion &amp; blind nationalism. No offense but the entire reason we came to the United States was because we weren't nationalists. The entire reason we intervened in European affairs in the 1900s was because of nationalism. I'm not saying I disagree with you but I think it'd kind of a bullshit ethnocentric thing to say all things considered.

Each country has its blemishes. We (Belgians) had a king in the early 1900s who saw Congo as his personal property. More black people died during his reign than Jews during World War II. We like to pretend it never happened, but it did. Nothing we do can change that though, we can only try not to repeat our mistakes. So yes, when we see people waving flags (unless it's a sporting event) and shouting USA! USA!, some of us tend to get a little leery. While a bit of nationalism is encouraged, it can go to extremes rather quickly. And while you seem to have noticed how and where it went wrong in Europe, you don't seem to be learning from the mistakes we made.


&gt; The veracity of this observation will not be known for ten or twenty years. He was an incredibly influential leader and this death is very significant for American foreign policy. If you want to think less of Americans taking to the streets (I do) because of his death, that's fine, but lets not downplay the importance of it. Oh, and apparently being European has given you a license to ignore the common mans sense of closure. 2000 years of culture, a little light on the empathy.

He may still have been important to Americans, but I somewhat doubt the rest of the world felt the same way. If anything, you've killed a symbol, while fueling what he stood for. I was hoping his death would change your foreign policy (i.e., end the wars), but it won't. And therefore, it won't change the way how these countries feel about the US.  
Don't get me wrong, I think the world is better off without him. But no doubt in my mind, there are tons of people worldwide who feel the same way about Bush (and Obama). While 3000 people died on 9/11, many more lives were destroyed by your country.

&gt; I can't speak for the government but I imagine they thought it would be more symbolic to show the world how the United States military works. The world can mock and laugh at Americans, they can call us uncultured and uncouth, but at the end of the day our soldiers are very highly trained and they don't fuck around.

I don't think the symbolism is lost on us. You provide financial support to and encourage violent militants, but once the beast you helped create is out of its cage, it needs to die a swift death. No, you really don't fuck around.

&gt; I believe that the American contention that terrorism = military intervention is an axiom that pretty much everyone in the world understands.

If that were the case, Iraq would have never been invaded. How would you react if Iraq started bombing US cities because of the acts of terrorism the US has carried out in their country? Or does it stop being terrorism when your government backs it?

Many people are just like me, saddened and bitter about the direction out country has gone. Unfortunately, it's the vocal minority that makes everyone else look bad. 

Now, with that being said, let's not act as though these concepts are completely foreign to you guys. Your national anthem is 'God Save the Queen' so clearly god plays a part in your country's makeup, and aside from that, it's just one of those things said by all politicians because it's what they are expected to say. Just like the star athlete on the winning team never says 'Fuck yeah, I'm the best there is!' He says 'this was a team effort' and 'the other team played their hearts out' even if they didn't. And the queen and the crown are important to bring up. America has no queen, no crown. Instead, we use the flag and the Statue of Liberty as placeholders. Just like you put the queen on your money, we put the flag on our lapels. And although many people do own flags, it's not like there's a local flag store. Many are obtained through military service.  

I don't deny that nationalism can lead to worse things, but self-deprecation only leads to a loss of your ties to your country. The British colonies are a perfect example of the bipolar attitude towards national pride. Not enough pride in the crown to not break away, but too much pride to not stand up for their new country. 

Realistically, I think what it boils down to is the American culture is entirely dependent on the American country. You don't say the Irish are proud of being from Ireland, you say they're proud to be Irish. You don't say the Spanish are proud to be from Spain, you say they're proud to be Spanish, because those concepts exist outside of just the country.

January 12 – A 7.0-magnitude earthquake occurs in Haiti, devastating the nation's capital, Port-au-Prince. With a confirmed death toll over 230,000[7][8][9] it is one of the deadliest on record.

February 18 – The President of Niger, Tandja Mamadou, is overthrown after a group of soldiers storms the presidential palace[13] and form a ruling junta, the Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy headed by chef d'escadron Salou Djibo.
February 27 – An 8.8-magnitude earthquake occurs in Chile, triggering a tsunami over the Pacific and killing 497.[15] The earthquake is one of the largest in recorded history.

March 26 – The ROKS Cheonan, a South Korean Navy ship carrying 104 personnel, sinks off the country's west coast, killing 46. In May, an independent investigation blames North Korea, which denies the allegations.

April 14 – Volcanic ash from one of several eruptions beneath Eyjafjallajökull, an ice cap in Iceland, begins to disrupt air traffic across northern and western Europe.
April 13 – A 6.9-magnitude earthquake occurs in Qinghai, China, killing at least 2,000 and injuring more than 10,000.
April 20 – The Deepwater Horizon oil platform explodes in the Gulf of Mexico, killing eleven workers. The resulting oil spill, one of the largest in history, spreads for several months, damaging the waters and the United States coastline, and prompting international debate and doubt about the practice and procedures of offshore drilling.

First I pointed out several times that I never labeled America as the people but rather the government.. Al though like any 'democratic' government it is only as good as the people that elect it. 

Because Joe Rogan is a comedian and UFC host makes him less creditable? People have a lot of extra activity. Joe has been an activist for a very long time and has spent countless hours researching about what it is he talks and jokes about..... If Carl Sagan presented the same pieces of evidence you would not think twice.... Like I said, that was not some made up bullshit.. IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. You can gain access to it through freedom of information act.. 

Lybia and Syria- 2 countries that have been armed 2 the teeth by America or its European allies... North Korea- Too broke to even have electricity. China- Industrial superpower that doesn't even have air craft carriers... Largest military in the world and how many countries do they occupy??? Right... Back to Syria... Where is the US now? Why is it the UN is dropping bombs in Libya but no Syria? Well let's take a look... United States used Syria as a detention and torture state post 9/11. Oil- It's declining in Syria and it's declining FAST. Turkey.. Turkey is too vital and stable to the middle east to be that close to a country with American or UN boots on the ground. 

Travel.. I have been a few places but don't didn't or won't change how I feel about any of this.. The world is indeed full of it's share of assholes but to say they are distributed equally is a little off the beaten path.... 

I just think you should really look into the war machine that America is and truly understand just what it is EXACTLY that your government is capable of. I said on here before on a different topic.. America makes GUNS!! Lots of em! For America to make money, they need to sell guns. In order to sell guns there needs to be war. In order for war, America needs to start it.... 

Now full circle back to the very beginning of all of this. OBL is dead. Shot and killed by a JSOC unit in Pakistan. Under order of the President of the United States. OBL was next to Hitler the most known mass murderer in the world. The man was responsible for 1000's of lives... Tens of thousands? Maybe, maybe not. 100s of thousands... NO... 
According to JustForeignPolicy.org Iraq has suffered almost 1.5 million total deaths since 2003.... So who is NOT the terrorist organization?? 

Look man. I get it.. You love your country. I love mine too. But I love the world more. I love the vast amounts of culture, diversity and sheer volume this earth has to offer. America loves America... It is what you are taught in your educational system, it is what your country has been founded upon. World history in America is about where America has been... I'm sorry, but until America learns to take care of itself at HOME and stop killing more people then any other country on the planet including Syria and North Korea who are amongst the worst human rights countries in the world.... Until then, I believe the American GOVERNMENT is a fully sanctioned and tax dollar paid terrorist organization....

the ottomans were in occupation and the arabs violently resisted against them as well

&gt;Oh, no! Jews moved into the neighborhood! Burn them out!

not just any jews (there were of course many indigenous jews from the area) it was european and russian colonizers that were the problem

&gt;So you agree that we need to beat the shit out of some beaners, maybe string up a couple. That will stop that damned immigration stuff. And those damn Muslims are moving in. If we burn down a couple of Mosques they will know their place.

when mexicans start coming to the US and establishing mexican only settlements and claiming that US land is theirs, i'll be the first one to say they should be sent back to mexico

&gt;He claimed the land belong to the Jews? We all know that Jews are not allowed to own any land in Dar al Islam. What was that dhimmi thinking? It's like those uppity niggras, thinking they have the right to vote.

""he"" is a ukranian who happens to be a jew.  not sure why you think it's ok for him to claim that land in the middle east belongs to him.

&gt;Illegal because the Arabs were rioting and killing to stop the Jews. And you still have not given any justification for the Arab violence. But you have given justification for Jews defending themselves.

actually no.  the british at that time had not agreed to allow jews from europe and russia to establish a country in the mandate.  in fact they passed a law which specifically banned european jews from immigrating there.  the balfour declaration was passed in 1917, but clarified by the Churchill white paper in 1919.

&gt;Exactly, fuck them and let them die. Just as I am sure you think that the Darfuris should not be going to Chad, they should just die in place. Just like it is wrong for Iraqis to have left Iraq and wrong for Afghanis to have left Afghanistan. They should just stay and die. (I think of that as sarcastic, but you probably don't give a damn about those people.)

thanks for cutting off my statement to make your point.  i didn't say european and russian jews have no right to self-determination.  i said they have no right to self-determination in land that doesn't belong to them.  as an american, i have no right to self-determination in indonesia.  that's not how it works.  the full legal term is ""self-determination of non-self-governing peoples (colonized and/or indigenous)"" that should give you a clue

&gt; No, actually, they don't. That was a stated yet again with the reconciliation.

you just misunderstand what hamas is saying.  they don't recognize israel in its current form.  if israel would agree to the 1967 borders, hamas has said years ago that they would accept this.

It is because people had something to eat that they could go on, and work in their farmlands, and then improve their lives ( the high yielding rice from Biorlaugh helped too).

1: This is a given. Any sufficiently large military operation conducted by an aggressor will provoke a response in kind. 

2: This they tried and failed at. They were predicting a large-scale popular uprising against the US. What they got were sectarian struggles in Iraq that petered out and opportunistic half-hearted resistance in Afghanistan. They projected their identity and fervor on to the populations of Iraq and Afghanistan and failed to take into account the relatively pro-western (not government but society) and surprisingly secular sentiments of the iraqis and the war weariness of the afghans, who value stability and safety over ideology. A recent poll by the Asia Foundation determined that the number of afghans who think the country is heading in the right direction has increased every year since 2006 and the vast majority believe that they are better off now than in any year since 2004 (the first year of the poll). 

3: This failed to happen. In the west we may associate our retarded decision to invade Iraq as fulfilling this but what al Qaeda was hoping for was war stretching from palestine through Saudi Arabia and on to Pakistan. Now we are withdrawing from Iraq and besides limited actions in Pakistan and Libya, which do not come close to what they were expecting, we actually have better relations with most Arab countries now than we did in 2001. 

4: The franchising happened-- for about four years. Then it petered out. Why? Because killing 20 people in a European train station bombing has absolutely nothing to do with US foreign policy decisions and they're  too occupied avoiding predator drone strikes to plan large-scale operations anymore. They assumed that like after the Beirut bombings and mogadishu we would cut and run when faced with more violence. This assumed an inherent weakness in western character that was based on their sense of righteous superiority that has no basis in fact. 

5: Ah number 5. This is what most westerners will click their teeth at. But cable news bloviators aside, western society is in no danger of economic collapse, and the sub-prime mortgage meltdown had absolutely nothing to do with our military spending. As a comparison, our debt after WW2 and the Korean War makes our current debt level look positively solvent. A popular myth in the Arab world was that the ""brave, virtuous, Islamic martyrs of Afghanistan"" single-handedly brought down the soviet union. But they didn't. Decades of bungled central planning, low (possibly artificially low due to meddling by the US) oil and gas prices, and internal political dissent after decades of repression were what did the soviets in--  not Timmy the terrible Taliban. Just for reference, the nine year invasion of Afghanistan killed .005% of the population the USSR. (15000 deaths out of 286000000 citizens) Hardly a crippling blow, and nothing compared to WWII.

There's some truth to this, but I don't think that this applies to all modern medicine. Things like birth defects, disabilities, etc are not just by products of civilization. They can be of course. There's no shortage of evidence for that. But natural immunities will only take us so far. You mentioned the European arrival in the New World and the disease it brought. Yes, some indigenous people were able to adapt and survive, but why should the vast majority have to die without being aided? I'm sorry to say this, but I can't view this as anything but Social Darwinism. 

&gt; To cause most species of animals to go extinct (and possibly us included) so we can have a feel-good fest about vegetarianism rather than accepting our place in the ecosystem is pure insanity.

I only mention this because some anarcho-primitivists I have met are also strongly in favor of meat abolition. Not necessarily you or anyone on r/anarchism, it's just something I have noticed. I think the two points are incompatible. 

&gt; what prevents humans in a post-collapse environment from creating, learning, finding new forms of expression, and exploring?

Nothing at all. As I said in my comment, these things all existed before civilization too. My point might not have been clear here. What I meant is that there is tremendous value in the exploration and expression that has been done before, in sharing these things across time and culture. Which brings up the next point...

&gt; humans not only had oral histories before books

Absolutely, and oral histories were must more detailed that we could hope for today. But you simply can't compare to the amount of knowledge we have today. The human mind is incredible for the knowledge it can hold, but without other means to store, transmit, and teach, you'll lose the vast majority of it. Even if the mind had the capacity to store everything, there's not enough time in an average lifetime to learn it all. Maybe most of it is useless to a post-civilization world. Let's consider medicine again. Without having access to the wealth of data available on human biology, we're less equipped to deal with changes in our environment. The earth is not a stable environment. Mass extinctions existed before human beings evolved. That's not to say that human beings are not capable to making things worse. We absolutely are and that needs to be addressed immediately.

&gt; I apologize for being so aggressive, but your worldview is incoherent and incredibly shortsighted.

Look, I'm not trying to start fights with people here. You're entitled to your opinion and I'd like to discuss these things civilly. All of these responses contain some extremely important points.

The ""War to end all wars"" cliché was pure propaganda. Britain was involved in conflicts from the second the war ended- we never stopped being an imperial power, after all. They weren't necessarily on the same *scale* as WW1, but they remained fairly substantial- the intervention in post-revolution Russia, for example.

There was less appetite for a war *like that which they'd just gone through*. Far-off conflicts in heathen lands were another matter entirely.

And, yes. Churchill. Very much a product of his times, really- fairly prevalent opinions during that era. People tend to ignore those aspects of his makeup for the sake of elevating him to a national icon.

Are you familiar with the history of Athletic de Bilbao? Would you consider the fact that they only field Basque players just about football?

If you say yes to this last question then maybe you would also agree that wearing the shirt goes beyond simply playing football or playing for/supporting a club, it represents a community, a community that, as you know, was severely repressed under the dictatorship and that has strong nationalist sentiment.

I had my jaws wired shut for 6 weeks. The key to blending your food so that it's edible and still tasty is your mix of starch and liquid. You ALWAYS need a starch/liquid base. Don't throw a piece of lasagna in a blender without some chicken broth in there first. If you have a good starch/liquid base, you can blend almost anything savory in it and it will be tasty.

For Asian and Latin foods, use a rice porridge base. Make rice with a 10:1 liquid to rice ratio, stirring it often. Yeah, that seems like a lot, but you need the rice super mushy in order for it to blend well.

For American/European foods, cook egg noodles in broth until they practically fall apart when you pick it up with a fork.

Once you have a good based, you can blend almost anything into it. 

Chicken and fish blend really well. Beef is a little bit more difficult. Pork is good if it's pull-apart tender.

On the fly, blending Campbell's condensed soups in a blender actually turns out really well. Mixed the condensed soup and water in the blender, and then microwave or heat it up on the stove as usual.

If you want fruit or something sweet, stay away from anything with seeds or chocolate chips. They will not blend and will not get past the wires and teeth. I once ordered a smoothie with raspberries and strawberries and I had to rinse my mouth out every 3 sips, because the seeds couldn't get through my clenched jaw filter system.

On a side note, keep in mind that after you have the wires taken off, you'll have to bring your dental A-game afterwards. After not brushing 70% of your teeth's surface area, your teeth will be really susceptible to cavities afterwards. Use mouth wash whenever you can, but remember you won't be able to spit anything when you're jaws are wired. You'll just have to let everything leak out from behind your teeth.

On the first one, why not try a little reductio ad absurdum? If Congress could NOT regulate commerce between states, what then? Do the states regulate themselves? How does Congress know which of each state's exports are interstate exports and which are leaving the country? Would the union not then fall apart as everyone starts taking contol of their own situation and demanding autonomy? It would end up looking more like the European Union than the USA. 

On the other hand, maybe at the time the states were pushing back a bit against Congress, and thought it made more sense for them to do it. After all, having central government stick its nose into your business is ... well, their business!

On the second one, apart from the fact that that guy Milligan looks pretty scary stary, I guess that if you let the military courts take over, you might argue that there's no point in retaining the civil courts at the same time. Or rather, you need to have some kind of precedence, or you'll end up with two judges slugging it out for the right to preside. And it's pretty unfair to get subject to a death penalty just because there's a military judge in town. On the other hand, maybe you could argue that when there's a state of emergency, military shit has got to be numero uno.

As the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees freedom of religious expression, Canadian Muslims face no official religious discrimination. Under Section 2(a) of the Charter, the wearing of the hijab is permitted in schools and places of work. Religious holidays and dietary restrictions are also respected, but outside major urban areas it may be difficult to find halal food. 

The Muslim community in Canada is almost as old as the nation itself. Four years after Canada's founding in 1867, the 1871 Canadian Census found 13 Muslims among the population. The first Canadian mosque was constructed in Edmonton in 1938, when there were approximately 700 Muslims in the country. This building is now part of the museum at Fort Edmonton Park. After the removal of European immigration preferences in the late 1960s, Muslims began to arrive in significant numbers.

Compared to Muslims in Europe, Canadian Muslims have not faced the same set of problems. The Muslim community in Canada is just one among many ethnic, religious, racial and cultural communities that together make up Canada. 

We have Muslims occupying high-ranking positions in Canadian organizations and the fabric of Canadian society, such as [Lieutenant-Commander Wafa Dabbagh](http://muslimswearingthings.tumblr.com/post/2136130543/this-is-wafa-dabbagh-wafa-is-a-muslim-zumba) of the Canadian Navy and [Naheed Nenshi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naheed_Nenshi), mayor of Calgary (3rd largest city in Canada).

In May, 2010, Canada bestowed honorary Canadian citizenship upon the Aga Khan, a spiritual leader of 20 million Ismaili Muslims worldwide. Aga Khan became the second religious figure after the Dalai Lama to get the country's honorary citizenship.

As most Americans know, one of Canada's main cultural exports is comedy. Muslim Canadians are no exception. Our sitcom [Little Mosque on the Prairie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Mosque_on_the_Prairie) is an international success. ",t5_2qhbp,False,1427114999,t3_h2ei4,True

In general, the best I can tell is that America does get somewhat better prices on fuel in general, pre-tax, due to our geopolitical maneuvering around the oily section of the world. At the same time, our nation is set up such that this is not a *luxury*, it is a ***necessity***.

In a time of vast government revenue shortages and budget deficits, it is clear to me that there are major social benefits to taxing the shit out of things you don't like, if you're a government. Sin taxes are also a time-honored American tradition, being the first taxes passed in this country; sin taxes beat income taxes to the punch by about 150 years.

On the other hand, these commodity price fluctuations are of far less import to those in heavily-taxed areas precisely because of the taxes. Consider the Big Mac above: un-taxed, 1-&gt;1.29 is a 29% price increase, whereas 6-6.29 is about a 5% increase. This might be part of why we're looked at as whiners.

The other reason we might be looked at as whiners that isn't immediately apparent is the very structure of the American city. We *assume* cars; public transit is not done well in many cities such that it is not a viable alternative between class isolation (jobs are in ~~good~~ rich areas even if they're low-paying, dictating high commute time), lack of subscription to public transit (it's a last resort, very few take the bus voluntarily as it carries a cultural low-class stigma), and huge service area (Phoenix covers an area 30mi x 40mi) with very low density (not uncommon to ride empty buses). Our cities are set up for cars, and expressly not for walking in most cases.

It looks like a really thorny problem, but it looks to me like most of this would fix itself with a sin tax (and I think it's important we call it that) on gasoline so that we can reap the benefits of not being quite so enslaved to the market. Once the conditions exist to start preventing EVERYONE from driving, social stigmas will start to go away from public transit just because everyone will know someone using it.

In Europe, it's not just the petrol taxes either... the cost of driving in general is much higher. A license can be several thousand dollars to acquire, and registration is as well. Both are very expensive by design to invest people in driving, which is to say to make them understand that they are paying for a privilege.

prostitution and other types of sex work have been
increasingly contested, both in academia and in popular
debates. One perspective, the oppression paradigm, is
increasingly reflected in media reporting on the sex
industry and is steadily being articulated by government
officials in the USA, Europe, and elsewhere. The
proliferation of myths based on the oppression paradigm
is responsible for the rise of a resurgent mythology of
prostitution. This article examines the claims made by
organizations, activists, and scholars who embrace the
oppression paradigm, evaluates the reasoning and evidence used in support of their claims, and highlights
some of the ways in which this perspective has
influenced recent legislation and public policy in selected
nations. The author presents an alternative perspective,
the polymorphous paradigm, and suggests that public
policy on prostitution would be better informed by this
evidence-based perspective.

Knowledge regarding sex work is increasingly being
distorted by a group of influential activists, organizations,
and some academics who regard the sex industry as a
universally harmful institution. The ultimate objective of
these individuals (whom I refer to here as prohibitionists)
1
is to abolish the entire sex industry—namely prostitution,
pornography, strip clubs, and other commercial sex. Their
campaign has had two major outcomes: Firstly, it has
resulted in the ascendancy of what I call the oppression
paradigm, which in turn is contributing to a newly
resurgent mythology of prostitution. Secondly, this mythology has important real-world consequences: Public policies
increasingly are based on the contentions of prohibitionist
activists and scholars. This article critically evaluates the
main claims of this body of work and then documents their
growing incorporation into government policies.
Prescientific Reasoning
Renowned philosopher of science Karl Popper (1959) has
described prescientific reasoning as conclusions formed in
the absence of evidence or lacking in the critical ingredient
of falsifiability. Prescientific claims are especially apparent
among ideologues and political actors, whose passionate
commitment to a cause can undermine their objectivity, but
prescientific reasoning also has been documented in some
empirical research in various areas of knowledge production (Best 1999; Buchanan et al. 2003; di Mauro and Joffe
2007; Epstein 2006). Such so-called knowledge can have
profound policy implications.
The prohibitionist stance toward sex work is based on
a perspective that regards paid sexual services and
performances as inherently oppressive and exploitative.

“Hurting back” is the tool of the state’s logic of justice of revenge. It may “push away”, but certainly propagates violence, the “whup ‘em” mentality prevalent in high crime populations, while encouraging the illusions the state adores: taking crocodile tears for real remorse (“sure I’m sorry, you see me crying?”)

&gt;Yes their might be a great power in the purity of non-violence and dedication to absolute truth

I don’t know about “absolute truth”…

&gt;and honesty that you talk about but I am not a monk I am a working man.

I am not suggesting monkhood by any means.

&gt;I will concede that violence is often unproductive but I see little reason to abandon it altogether and completely rule it out for those times when the opportunity to use it to do great good might arise. 

You have to see the degree to which violence fuels the state. Gandhi didn’t rule it out altoghter, btw: “I would rather India resort to violence than be witness to her own dishonour”. 

&gt;As I read with interest the exhortations of ravia for a focus on non violence I was pretty disgusted both by his overall thesis and by the method with which he argued it. 

It is a pleasure simply to read the word “exhortation” used.


&gt;The first quote is about being suspicious of the sincerity of those who advocate non violence as a means of ending injustice and oppression.

I am all for that suspicion.

&gt; the police, FBI, CIA and military as the beneficiaries of the moral power to legally wield violence granted to them by passive acquiescence of non violence. 

That ain’t the kind of nonviolence I advocate. It is a prevalent form, to be sure, of which I am deeply critical.

&gt;I started this comment with the assertion that if something hurts me or those I care about I reserve the right to do something about it. Not the right to endure.

And I reserve the right to think, and to exhort to thought: namely, the thought that a kind of “reality” critique must be involved, simply because while one may assure themselves they are resisting “enduring”, they can end up enduring as much more more anyhow. In a case where a truly successful nonviolent revolution is possible, “pushing back” in the form of firebombs will incur staleamating conflicts with a police force who could be won over and *may* lead to people “enduring” protracted and spectacularly unsuccessful struggle. Violence is a dream as much as nonviolence is: neither is a dream purely.

&gt;Ravia claims that the Empire is afraid should a robust non violent movement spring up across the globe because dictators will fall like crazy and democracy and true self determination will spring up like weeds all around the globe in the ruins of the fallen regimes and that would be bad for the Empire to loose its puppets. 

Not exactly: the major tendency is for the violence to be reinscribed in state structures and justice systems, not to mention for the “nonviolence” in the first place to be the kind that Hilary Clinton affirms.

&gt;Those dictatorships and harsh regimes are of course faltering now, but it won’t be non violence that ends them but the true courage and determination to face up and fight for what is right by the masses of people that have been kept down for so long. They will seek justice on the tyrants who have ruled over them and why shouldn’t they?

This really is an insult to protesters who gave their lives in nonviolent resistance.

&gt;What of the Empire? What does the Empire want? The Empire wants what ravia wants. It wants non violence. 

The Empire wants systematized, domesticated violence, and *that* is the violence with which the supposedly “nonviolent”, the “peace and justice” activists, in the main, are deeply complicit.

&gt;It doesn’t want the soon to be free people of the Mid East and North Africa to understand the power they might wield. 

Perhaps that is why it’s ignoring Egypt and rather working up the theater in Lybia.

&gt;Violence is inevitable. 

This is one of the conditions of the possibility of nonviolence. 

&gt;If the people forgo their right to it then it will be the state that benefits and states are more easily controlled by the Empire than people. 

Gandhi would have agreed with you.

&gt;So even as we speak the Empire is busy working around the globe spreading the non violent message in earnest. So ravia it is those like yourself who endorse non violence who are the true tools of the Empire.

You have to realize that most of what passes for nonviolence is, in my view, not simply a sham but one of the worst travesties in the world.

&gt;In Promoting Polyarchy

Polyarchy as a concept is fully in keeping with what I call “enarchy” as a general form/concept.

&gt;Robinson describes how the CIA, the FBI and other intelligence agencies were pressured to cut back on many of their more repressive covert activities (i.e. covert assassination) as a result of Church committee reforms enacted in the 1970s. This resulted, in 1984, in the creation of the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which works closely with the CIA and the US Agency for International Development (the USAID is a well-documented conduit for CIA funding), as well as other ""democracy manipulating"" foundations, such as US Institute for Peace, the Albert Einstein Institute, the Arlington Institute, Freedom House and the International Republican Institute. Robinson specifically outlines how these US-based ""democracy manipulating organizations"" orchestrated ""non-violent"" revolutions in the Philippines and Chile to prevent genuinely democratic governments from coming to power, as well as sabotaging democratically elected governments in Nicaragua and Haiti (where they caused the ouster of the Sandinista government and the populist priest Jean Bastion Aristide). Since then numerous studies have furnished further examples where these organizations have infiltrated and ""channeled"" (i.e. co-opted) the genuine mass movements that form naturally in countries dominated by repressive dictators. The goal is to make sure they don't go too far in demanding economic rights (for example, labor rights or restrictions on foreign investment) that might be detrimental to the interests of multinational corporations. All the ""color"" revolutions in Eastern Europe , which also received substantial funding from George Soros' Open society Institute, have been a major disappointment owing to their failure to bring about genuine change.

This kind of critique is never dismissable! I do know about the Aristide shit to some extent. The Albert Einstein Institution materials were helpful in Egypt, I believe. “Nonviolence” can’t really be blamed so universally as this, especially where there has been little to no real, robust nonviolence.

&gt;So you see, the Empire wishes to be the sole legitimate arbiter of what the moral use of violence is in the globe.

Maybe so. Radical nonviolence has at this. You want to reduce it to power and Become the Power yourself, where you would, presumably, be better. The power would always have to pass through a critique of its violence and violence itself must be deconstructed as being largely forceful illusion. It remains that submitting to power wielding violence is never the right reason, more or less, and your complaints of such power are themselves a kind of nonviolence.

- Rebuild the twin towers almost exactly as they were - just a better version 2

- Covertly arrange 'accidents' for high profile Islamic extremists world wide. Have them looking over their shoulders. We shouldn't even publicise this shit, just go and find the people who are causing trouble, drop in dressed in balaclavas and kill them. We should frame other countries for it too.

- Pump money into pro-western media. Saudi Arabia funds schools around the world that teach kids that Jews are pigs, we should do the same except make Islamic fundamentalism seem boring. Drop a load of pornography on Afghanistan and make sure young teenagers know that sex feels better than stupid fucking religion.

- Don't trust fuckers like Pakistan, Saudi and the Afghans. I could have told you they were all a bunch of backwards fuckers 10 years ago, but no.

- Invest heavily into alternative energy that doesn't rely on Saudi Arabia. They are our single biggest enemy in the world and the entire reason Islamic terrorism exists

- Make America 10x better and rub it in the faces of every middle eastern government so their people demand change

What we did instead:

- Bomb the shit out of everything

- Send all our soldiers to die protecting someone elses land

- Start 2 Vietnams

- Kiss Saudi Arabias ass even harder

- Let any immigrant into our country without question, even if the first thing they did when they came here was to claim social security and openly denounce non-Muslims.

Since you'd like to change the definition of who a Semite is, can you point to a source which says Semites do not exist? Thanks.

&gt;Yes I did. The Greco languages are on the same level as Celtic and German. Greek is no more closely related to Latin than it is to Swedish.

You seem to be confused and I don't know what one earth you're arguing here. You said that there was no subset called Greco-Roman languages, well it's called Hellenistic Greek Languages and there are two branches as the link you gave demonstrated. So either you're ignoring your own link or don't know what you're talking about.

&gt;So they are not in a language family smaller than Indo-European. Greek is no closer to Latin than it is to Welsh.

Irrelevant statements, you said there was no Greek subset, this clearly says:

&gt;Wikipedia: Greek (ελληνικά, IPA: [eliniˈka] or ελληνική γλώσσα, IPA: [eliniˈci ˈɣlosa]), **an independent branch of the Indo-European family of languages, is the language of the Greeks.**

An **INDEPENDENT**, **BRANCH**, see those words? Go learn it kid.

&gt;I have. And I forgot you were trolling.

Sorry, when did I take on your identity? I understand you suffer from superiority complex but it's okay, we'll find a clinic for you.

Current revenue from the petroleum sector is estimated to be at its peak period and to decline over the next decades.

Actually I provided facts and you speculated.  I told you that Europe pays a much higher level of taxes than we do on gasoline (no I didn't quote the exact taxes), but maybe some actual numbers will appease you:


""In the U.S., about 11% of the final cost per gallon is from taxes. At the $4.00 per gallon average cost, this means that $0.44 is tax and $3.56 is the pretax cost per gallon. Europe’s prices, on the other hand, are comprised of 70% taxes and 30% pretax cost. Taxes on the $8.70 average per gallon cost are $6.09 and the pretax cost per gallon is $2.61.""

Look at the Native Americans for proof that a lack of large domesticated animals makes industrialization nearly impossible - they had the wheel (their toys did) but they had nothing to pull it ergo no wagon, not trade, no consolidation of goods (quick consolidation). Only so much can be done with human strength, only so large a population can be supported.

There is, however, a possible saving grace - a natural network of rivers/waterways for shipping goods around/using the water for pulley power (instead of animals).

Basically, it comes down to where you drop the people off geographically. If you drop them in something like Australia (the Melbourne area at least) or the western parts of North or South America they will be really really fucked for a long time/they may never come out of a level of tech similar to the aboriginals. If you drop them off in much of southern Europe/Turkey/Northern Africa, you're golden - plenty of food, easily accessible ore, gentle waterways for transport. Other places could be better or worse but I think a heavily forested area laced with waterways without being heavily mountain-ed, is key. 

If you drop them somewhere that is mostly flat land without waterways and lots of trees (for boats) it could take upwards of 1-3k years - some aspects of the civilization will be more advanced (medical) but the industrial portion/city building capabilities will be limited for a long time. 

If you drop them somewhere with lots of trees, easily accessible ore (see small mountains) and navigable waterways I think you'll see them jump from neolithic to bronze age in the first 3 generations with a tech level similar to the 1800's by the time they reach 1M people and tech similar to our own today by the time they reach 10M people.

Nope, 1pm is 1 hour after noon everywhere. With your model, 1pm could be midnight as well, which you would have to adapt to each time you step out of a plane. That is even more confusing than the current model, where you just adapt your watch and your done. While your proposal is logical, it is not practical. Calculating with binary numbers is completely logical as well. As a human I prefer decimal numbers, even when programming (which involves lots of conversion, as my computer has no idea how to handle decimals) ...

&gt; I can't force other people to speak and think in GMT. Your suggestion is not rational.

So just because you can not enforce the several dozen people you are working with to just use GMT for what it was invented for, you want several billion people to switch their time model. Sure: it's me not being rational, lol ...

&gt; I simply disagree with the assertion that local time needs to match up with the position of the sun.

Nobody made that assertion. It just turns out to be the current model. Switching model involves LOTS of hassle to the hole world (billions of people) by providing very little benefit to very few people (some millions maximum, but I doubt its even that much as hole Europe is on GMT since a long time, just US needs his own model once again).

&gt; All scheduling would be easier if there was a standard universal time

Once again: there IS a universal standard time. You are just not using it and you blame it on other people that you are not doing so. Several hundred million people use it all day in Europe, some more hundred million do so in Africa, I'm not sure for Asia and South America ...

&gt; there is no compelling reason to use time zones 

Well, there is one: everybody already uses them, is adapted to them and can deal with them. Changing that would cause LOTS of trouble and provide little to no benefit. The solution of your little problem, the only one which actually benefits from universal standard time, is using GMT. You just do not accept that you yourself are the problem. You want the hole world to change to spare yourself the hassle to change some little thing in your own environment.

One is only more expensive because of the quality of the build and materials, and because of the laws of supply and demand. That is, the biggest reason why a lot of expensive things are expensive is because people will pay that price. A (rational) company will always charge a price that will maximize it's profits, no matter what the cost to create that product is. In a highly competitive market, with things like chewing gum or corn, where there are a lot of people making the product, there's almost no profit to be had, since the SD laws have pretty much squeezed it all out. The real profit margins are in unique and luxury goods, like designer stuff. 

Did you know that diamonds are almost worthless? It's only because De Beers actually owns about 40% of all the world's rough diamonds (100 years ago, it was 90%), and essentially created in the minds of men and women that you HAD to have a diamond to validate your love for one another. They completely made that up. Diamonds were actually pretty worthless before that marketing campaign. So, why does a company charge a certain price for something (that might seem outrageous)? Quite literally, **because they can.**

Still though, you have to be mindful that despite its abstract value to you, there is still a real cost you incur for not recognizing the price tag. You know what the difference is between the Mars desk and the IKEA one is? The Mars one takes 50x more of your money. So why spend it? 

Your mindset is very interesting. I've honestly never met anyone like that before. It's good to spend the money on quality when it's important to you, but if you want to do well in the long run, the distinction between what you need and what you want has to be formed. Since it wasn't learned early on as a habit, like most people,  you'll have to learn it now, and it's going to take practice. Like, actually taking the time in your head to try and rationally compare two items. It really isn't too difficult. Go ahead and try it! 

I guess it's just second nature to me nowadays; I always question in my mind if what I'm spending is really worth my hard earned money. It's a simple concept, but spending a lot of money on something you don't really need puts you farther and farther away from something you do really want (like that house in Europe). For me, at the moment, I'm saving for a motorcycle. I'm fortunate to be supported by my parents while I'm in school, but for the next five or six months, I'm not buying anything I don't absolutely need, just so I can save up all the money I'll need to get the bike.

I like your plan. I figure that it's very doable if you live somewhere where land/rent is very inexpensive, and you have a penchant for only spending money on things you consider absolutely essential to your happiness (like hobbies). My plan is to make good living as an engineer, but to save like, 30-50% of that money every year. The rest would be barebones living expenses and a couple hobbies (skydiving, drums, and a motorcycle). No kids, at least till I'm 40. ",t5_2qh1i,False,1427116411,t3_h2ryg,True

I have never seen a talk of Caliphate that did not involve some sort of talk how Muslim rulers are US puppets and hot they must be fought to return to Caliphate. 

&gt; Also I fail to see what was so peaceful about the creation of modern day Europe,

I was talking about creation of EU, not about European history in general. 

&gt; Whose laws are we talking about?

State and international. 

&gt;&gt;  It is a call for a violent overthrow and return to some muslim utopia.

&gt; How do you figure?

Well it's been a while since I have been a part of Muslim community, so I suppose I could be wrong on this point. 

&gt; To a Muslim, the term ""Islamic"" is synonymous with ""good"" and ""just"" and ""fair."" The more fair, just, and good a system is, the more Islamic it is. Many Muslims see secular democracy as the most Islamic form of government. 

I think you are stretching it here. Look back in Muslim History and you will not find modern secular democracy anywhere. While Muslims were historically better in their treatment of non-Muslims than can be said of most other faiths, Islamic countries were not secular parliamentary democracies with equality under the law. 

&gt;&gt;  This is equivalent to a communist vision of world wide worker revolution.

&gt; This is the biggest bullshit I've ever heard.

I was a Muslim and I grew up under communism, and I know what I am talking about. It is a same idea of ""if everyone adopted this philosophy, everything would be milk and honey"".Things never work out like that. 

&gt; Whether or not an Islamic country can have a non-Muslim ruler is debatable. 

Oh yeah? How many people would agree with your interpretation? 

&gt; Personally I don't have a problem with having only Muslim rulers because, frankly, being ruled by a non-Muslim would suck.

And I would imagine that non-muslims would think that Muslim rule sucks. 

&gt; As for people not being equal under Islamic law, people are not equal under any law, period. ...  US law affords fantastic privileges to US citizens (the equivalent of a Muslim under an Islamic government), but non-citizens are treated with extreme harshness and cruelty. 

Nonsense! Being a citizen is a legal status and not a religious designation. You do not have to give up your faith to be a citizen of the USA. You are really stretching the logic here. 

&gt; Islamic law is more adamant about non-Muslims having rights, especially basic human rights, so while US law doesn't have any problem with imprisoning non-citizens indefinitely without trial, torturing them, deporting them if it feels like it, and so on, these things are inhumane from an Islamic standpoint. Anyway, I could go on all day but I'll leave it at that.

That is actually a violation of US law, just like I imagine Pakistani blasphemy law is violation of Sharia, right? 

&gt; Separation of religion and state is not a universal human concept.

What?! In US, separation of church and state was instituted specifically to - well separate religion from state. Many religious groups came to America to escape European persecution. The Article VI of US constitution could not be clearer on the matter:

* no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States *

&gt; What you're trying to do is use ""separation of church and state"" as a call to create ant-Islam governments in Muslim lands, which is retarded and won't work.

Nonsense! Secularism is western concept because West got rid of itself from religious influence once protestant reformation undid single organised church structure. All of a sudden you had more than one religion, and the necessity for people to live together despite their differences. 

You are saying that I am forcing Muslims to a non-Islamic order, when in fact you are forcing Islamic order on non-Muslims living in Muslim lands. State needs to be secular and religion needs to be personal. ",t5_2qhbp,False,1427116413,t3_h36vm,True

The Economist article bemoans the *current* lack of power of Europe's traditional big parties due to the decline of class politics, the decline of the working-class, anti-Communist sentiment and traditional religion. It describes this as a factor in the politics of this time not as part of the nature of any political system and specifically mentions FPTP is not helping the UK escape from this. (Note: the UK uses P.R. for elections to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly, London Council, Northern Ireland Assembly, European Elections and Scottish municipal elections - unlike us they are not stuck in FPTP-only-land). The article's solution is ""to enhance democracy"" not weaken it.

Eventually, even if he/she wasn't directly informed of the answer the torturer wanted, the victim would likely be able to figure out what it was the inquisitor wanted to hear and provide that information to end the suffering. 

Take the case of Benito Garci who lived in Spain in 1490. Benito was a [converso](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converso), a person who had converted from Judaism to Christianity. But he lived in the age of [Torquemada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom%C3%A1s_de_Torquemada), a time when conversos were suspected of not being ""true"" Christians and when the wealth of well-to-do conversos could be seized by the Spanish government with a portion going to the inquisitor who could extract a confession of guilt, though Benito was only an itinerant woolcomber.

&gt;On his return journey to his home in the village of La Guardia in the province of Toledo, he stopped overnight in the Roman town of Astorga. At an inn there he fell in with a rowdy crowd of locals, drank too much, and when he passed out, he was robbed. The thieves fell greedily upon his knapsack. As they were rummaging through it, a communion wafer fell out on the floor.
&gt;
&gt;Recoiling in fear, the thieves sensed something sinister, even by their grubby standards. And yet this seemed like a piece of special good luck, a chance to get in the good graces of the authorities to cover up their petty crimes. The scoundrels shook their prey back to consciousness and hustled him along to the ornate cathedral and into the presence of the most powerful prelate in town. He was the bishop's vicar, an ambitious upstart named Pedro de Villanda, who had fond hopes of becoming an inquisitor one day. The vicar saw the possibilities immediately, most especially for his own career. More than sinister, a communion wafer in the possession of a false Christian who was returning from a sham pilgrimage to the most holy site in all of Europe: this smacked of heresy, sacrilege, and conspiracy ... and the chance of advancing the vicar's career in the Church.
&gt;
&gt;The woolcomber protested his innocence vigorously, even after he was dragged to the dungeon and administered two hundred lashes. And so the vicar resorted to more stringent measures. Under Article 15 of Torquemada's Instructions, torture was acceptable if a heresy was ony ""half proven."" Under no circumstandes was the priest to shed blood, for this would contravene the laws of the Church. If the supect should happen to die under torture, the priest would be held responsible and would have to seek absolution from his bishop. This could be embarrassing and might harm a career.
&gt;
&gt;And thus, ""the Question,"" as torture was called, was put to Benito cruelly but bloodlessly. Given the gravity and the potential of the suspicion, it is likely that the vicar was impatient and put his suspect through an accelerated version of the five normal steps. First torture was merely to be threatened. If that did not compel a confession, the culprit was to be taken to the torture chamber and shown the instruments. If the stout fellow was still untalkative, he was then to be stripped in readiness; and if that was not enough, the naked person was to be strapped onto the rack. Only then, in step number five, which was rarely needed, was the winch on the rack actually to be turned.
&gt;
&gt;But Benito Garcia was stubborn and unyielding - a five-step man all the way. Even as his body was ""prolonged"" serveral inches in the ""Question of the First Degree,"" or put more precisely, as his muscles began to rip and his bones began to crack, he remained silent.
&gt;
&gt;When the rack did not produce the desired result, the churchmen turned to the water torture. In this hideous remedy, the prsioner was tied to a ladder that sloped downward, so that the head was lower than the feet. The head was held fast in position by a metal band, twigs were placed in the nostrils, and ropes winched tightly around his appendages. The mouth was forced open with a metal piece and a cloth placed over the mouth. Then a pitcher of water was brought, and water poured over the cloth. With each swallow, the cloth was drawn deeper into the throat, until in gagging and choking the victim nearly asphyxiated. The terror of suffocation was extreme, and the process was repeated endlessly, bloating the body grotesquely until the victim was ready to confess. If the suspect was still uncooperative, his body was turned over, causing unimaginable pain in the heart and lungs. From the inquisitor's standpoint - for he was there to record every detail - the treatment was easy to administer and left no telltale signs.
&gt;
&gt;Garcia had been able to hold his tongue for a few days, but on the fifth day of torture, his resistance crumbled.

And so, at last the bishop's vicar had the answer he wanted. 

&gt;Under the threat of more torture, Garcia blurted out an astonishing tale. At some time in the past two years, he, along with several Jews and conversos in the town, had engaged in a secret and magical rite with a human heart and a consecrated communion wafer. This powerful mixture was meant to create a toxin of mass destruction with marvelous results: the Inquisition would be blocked; all Christians would die raving mad; Jews would seize their property and take over the world. Whether in fact Benito blurted this out, or whether the tale came from the fertile imagination and ambition of the vicar is unclear.

First, you are attempting to conflate two very different models of operation, the European driving-as-paid-privilege model, with the American as-much-unpaid-public-good-as-we-can-get-for-nothing model.

Second, since you seem to have not read it, I'll just copypasta this from above: 
&gt;Consider the Big Mac above: un-taxed, 1-&gt;1.29 is a 29% price increase, whereas 6-6.29 is about a 5% increase. This might be part of why we're looked at as whiners.

The amount you already have to pay makes the commodity fluctuation mean less. America chose not to tax gas as heavily, this is one of the consequences of that.

Third, I'm not really clear what your point is in the last paragraph. Did someone ask for cheaper gas? Did we ask someone ELSE to pay for OUR cheaper gas? Don't worry, you'll all pay for our gas as long as we're among the kings of consuming, simply because it is cheaper to buy in quantity due to increased leverage in price negotiation. That said, I don't look at anyone as being ""on our backs"" except the oil companies taking advantage of the barrel we're over.

Finally and furthermore, there are (at least) two distinct groups in America: those for whom high gas prices are a life-threatening problem, and those who have the ability to fix it.

So, this is a throwaway account, with a long, *long* story. 

**TL;DR: My ex-girlfriend created two people that weren't actually real that talked to me over the internet in an elaborate ploy to manipulate me. Also, she faked a pregnancy/child and faked letters from the adopted parents to further let me fall into this trap.** 

Context: I'm seventeen. Beth is twenty. Changing everyones names. Don't let crazy women pull you in and get you wrapped around their fingers. This isn't a lie I got away with, but rather one that she did, for a while. 

I started dating this girl, Beth, two years ago. She seemed nice enough. Very attractive, a little bit crazy, but I liked it. I'd liked Beth for a while but never had the means to get with her until, well, I did. So we'd been dating for a few weeks when she told me about this very strange and overprotective friend of hers named ""Max"". Max started being her friend in middle school, after her first boyfriend, and apparent ""true love of her life"" died in a car accident. His name was Jonathan. They had sex when she was twelve and he was fourteen and she still loves him today. More on that later. 

Anyway, Beth tells me that Max wants to speak to me. That he's an ""older"" guy, but he's her friend. I'm like sure whateverwhatever. Start talking to him over AIM, apparently he lives in Europe, he's filthy rich, but a very nice guy and had a relationship with Beth after Jonathan died. Fast forward about a month or so and I find out why there relationship stopped. 

*Apparently*, Max is actually something along the lines of eighty three years old, but looks like he's nineteen, because he and some others were tested on when they were little and now live to be much older than normal people. They all live in a mansion in Europe. Why do I believe this? I have no idea. Probably because I was falling in love with Beth and didn't think she'd have any reason to lie to me. I mean, sure, I didn't completely believe it, but I trusted her.

1) Gasoline prices aren't pegged to just the cost of crude oil (I know you know this, but it bares repeating).

2) Supply side situations influence prices in ways people don't realize.  Case in point, the Libyan oil crisis is causing european nations like France and Germany (who get something like 15% of their gasoline supply from Libya) are forced to import crude from Saudia Arabia and other arab nations.  The crude from this region is a ""sour"" crude, which means it is sulfur rich and costs more to refine as opposed to the ""sweet"" Libyan crude, which has a lower sulfur content.  While supply is technically still keeping up with demand, the associated refining costs are much higher.

3) Crude price drops in the Cushing index won't be reflected in gasoline prices in any meaningful way immediately.  The purchased crude still has to go through the value adding process of refining.  Even then, the crude prices referenced (as mentioned, this is normally the Cushing index) is the spot market price.  The spot market is an open market for oil not pledged to any given refinery, and is not always indicative of what typical refineries are actually paying for crude.

&gt;* Start using wood for energy

From an economist at Royal Dutch Shell: 

&gt;To realize how threatening it would be to start to run out of cheap hydrocarbons before we have a renewable replacement technology, we have only to imagine a world without them. In 17th and 18th century Holland and Britain, there were small pockets of considerable wealth, commercial success, and technological progress. Western Europe was just beginning to build canals, a huge step forward in transportation productivity that would last 200 years and leave some canals that are still in use today. With Newton, Leibniz, and many others, science, by past standards, was leaping forward. Before the world came to owe much to hydrocarbons, Florence Nightingale – a great statistician, by the way – convinced the establishment that cleanliness would save lives. Clipper ships were soon models of presteam technology. A great power like Britain could muster the amazing resources to engage in multiple foreign wars around the globe (not quite winning all of them!), and all without hydrocarbons or even steam power. Population worldwide, though, was one-seventh of today’s population, and life expectancy was in the thirties.

&gt;But there was a near fatal flaw in that world: a looming lack of wood. It was necessary for producing the charcoal used in making steel, which in turn was critical to improving machinery – a key to progress. (It is now estimated that all of China’s wood production could not even produce 5% of its current steel output!) The wealth of Holland and Britain in particular depended on wooden sailing ships with tall, straight masts to the extent that access to suitable wood was a major item in foreign policy and foreign wars. Even more important, wood was also pretty much the sole producer of energy in Western Europe. Not surprisingly, a growing population and growing wealth put intolerable strains on the natural forests, which were quickly disappearing in Western Europe, especially in England, and had already been decimated in North Africa and the Near East. Wood availability was probably the most limiting factor on economic growth in the world and, in a hydrocarbonless world, the planet would have hurtled to a nearly treeless state. Science, which depended on the wealth and the surpluses that hydrocarbons permitted, would have proceeded at a much slower speed, perhaps as little as a third of its actual progress. Thus, from 1800 until today science might have advanced to only 1870 levels, and, even then, advances in medicine might have exceeded our ability to feed the growing population. And one thing is nearly certain: in such a world, we would either have developed the discipline to stay within our ability to grow and protect our tree supply, or we would eventually have pulled an Easter Island, cutting down the last trees and then watching, first, our quality of life decline and then, eventually, our population implode. Given our current inability to show discipline in the use of scarce resources, I would not have held my breath waiting for a good outcome in that alternative universe.

&gt;But in the real world, we do have hydrocarbons and other finite resources, and most of our current welfare, technology, and population size depends on that fact. Slowly running out of these resources will be painful enough. Running out abruptly and being ill-prepared would be disastrous. [source](http://www.theoildrum.com/node/7853#more).

Today I've seen the USD make some broad based gains across the board, most notably against AUD and GBP. I think the fact that it has strengthened against AUD is the 'canary in the coal mine"". I don't use the DXY to judge USD strength since the DXY is mostly affected by the Euro. The only question/variable that I see going forward in regards to the USD is if the USD can sustain these gains and if so for how long. I still hold to my thesis that when QE2 ends: commodities/stocks/bonds will sell off while USD rallies. (Of course I should disclose that I am long the USD and short commodities right now)  It won't be instantaneous but over a period of time (probably 4-6 months) I think what we are witnessing right now is the market starting to price in the end of QE2. I would not be surprised to see silver at $25 by end of the year, or gold at 1300ish.

There are certainly those for whom a unified North America would be of personal economic benefit. It isn't remotely comparable to the EU, however, because of the gross disparity in economic power and population among the nations of North America. Because of this, it would be a much tougher sell here than it was in Europe. It was hard enough to get France, Germany, Spain, and the UK to agree to some sort of economic unification.

(How on earth does this thread only have 7 upvotes TOTAL?) I majored in Bio. so essentially I am merely an enthusiastic layman when it comes to international relations. But I have a few questions related to Af/Pak, South Asia in general, and some global issues. 

Af/Pak: Pakistan seems to be harboring terrorists. Not just Bin Laden -- many serious terrorists, like the guys responsible for the Bombay attacks a few years ago, are living safely in Pakistan. Is Pakistan a failed/rogue state? How should America's counterterrorism strategy deal with a nation that harbors terrorists and allegedly protects them? I think India, being a local power, and perhaps even China and Russia, really can step up with the Af/Pak mess. I agree that cutting down in Afghanistan might work, but the last time we left the region (post Soviet withdrawal) our negligence allowed an infestation to grow. While counterterrorism might require a global strategy, certainly there will be hotspots, and withdrawal will open up a can of worms. How do you think the West can engineer a multilateral solution for Af/Pak?

Any chance for a stable future in Afghanistan? I read up on Ahmad Shah Massoud and it was a damn shame that nobody in the US realized that he was a good guy until it was too late. Poor intelligence, and perhaps Saudi/Pakistani influence might contributed. For years we funded Massoud's enemies. But anyway, to the question. How can Afghanistan rebuild and form a functional government that isn't a repeat of the Taliban, or some other extremist regime? Is there any politically moderate figure left in the landscape, who isn't downright corrupt like Karzai and cronies?

Democratic peace theory flaws: Don't the wars between India and Pakistan, as well as those involving Israel, essentially destroy this theory? It seems that, even in modern history, nations ultimately go to war based on their self-interests, not because their enemies are not democracies. 

""Jasmine Revolution"" - the revolutions in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, etc. have changed the Middle East. There is a potential for an Islamic Caliphate forming, which in modern terms, can be considered as an analog to the European Union, but for the Middle East and North Africa. Does this seem realistic considering the Jasmine Revolution? How do you foresee American/European/NATO policy changing/responding to these massive developments?

I went to SCAD and graduated in 2008; I went in for a major in Film/TV production and a minor in motion graphics. The amount of on-set time I spent was a lot, and got to not only learn and try out different roles (PA/gaffer/cinematographer/art director/editor/director/producer) and focus on whatever I liked the best.  
I did leave SCAD with a fairly good reel of work. It also helps to be actively engaged in other student's production - you get what you give.    
  
One thing that I didn't like about SCAD was obviously the expensive tuition, but also the costs of some classes, material-wise. I considered cinematography for a while, but after talking to classmates found out that for some of the cinematography classes you have to purchase your own film (8 and 16mm not such a big problem... 35mm can be quite pricey). Regardless, my focus up ended up being in Producing and Post Production.  
My favorite professors were Lubomir Kocka for Directing, Michael Chaney for screenwriting, and Andy Meyers for anything regarding Producing.  
The most important thing I learned at film school I guess, is a variation of what I said earlier ""you get what you give"". Basically, if you want to be involved in great projects you need to push yourself to not only do great work, but also help out a great deal and socialize, network.

* For a lot of nature and culture combined, I would recommend a day or two-day trip west, to **Omberg** (national park alongside lake Vättern, my favorite piece of nature in the whole country) for day-hiking. Stay at **Stocklycke** vandrarhem. On the way, you can see the **Rökstenen** rune stone and the **Alvastra** cloister ruins.

If you go by car, make sure to take the wonderful **scenic road**, marked by brown roadsigns, rather than the highway. Also the lakeside village of **Gränna** is close enough, with its views, café's and traditional candy-makers, as is **Motala**.

* For watery outdoorsyness, **Göta Kanal** and **Kinda Kanal** (http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinda_kanal) and **Lake Roxen** are closeby, offering boating, kayaking, canoeing or canal-side biking.

* Stockholm is less than 2 hours away with the fast train, making it reachable for day trips. Book that ticket right away if you want to go, as train tickets have dynamic pricing and will be more expensive the longer you wait. 

* In neighbouring Norrköping the have **""Arbetets museum""** (museum of ""work""!), which some ppl find cool.

* For partying, I have no clue about specifics but I'm certain it will be where the students are, as Linköping is a university town. You want somebody to hook up with for this, check in r/sweden or couchsurfing or whichever other channels you may have.

There isn't anyone on the planet who knows whether Methoxetamine is a good idea.

I have no idea if this applies for the USA, but as far as I am aware, the UK, EU and Australia standards for bicycle helmets are only for a static impact only. For instance, you are stationary, standing over your bike and you fall to the floor and bang your head. They are not rated or tested for moving impact at all, never have been, and most likely never will be, as they would all fail dramatically.  

The text below is from the [UK National Cyclists Organisation](http://www.ctc.org.uk/desktopdefault.aspx?tabid=4688)

There is also the [research](http://www.bath.ac.uk/news/articles/releases/overtaking110906.html) carried out in the UK which states that (UK) motorists drive closer to cyclists wearing helmets, thus they more likely to be hit due to the perception of safety a helmet provides.

The British Medical Journal (BMJ) published a paper by [Dorothy Robinson](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/reprint/332/7543/722) (a statistician at the University of New England, New South Wales in Australia) reviewing the effects of helmet laws in Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Robinson shows that, despite significant increases in helmet-wearing, there was no greater improvement in cycle safety than for pedestrian safety over the same period. On the other hand, there were substantial reductions in cycle use, amounting to a significant loss of the health and other benefits of cycling. Robinson says: ""This contradiction may be due to risk compensation, incorrect helmet wearing, reduced safety in numbers (injury rates per cyclist are lower when more people cycle), or bias in case control studies."" Read more on the [BMJ helmet debate](http://www.ctc.org.uk/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabID=4690).

An article in [Injury Prevention magazine by Paul Hewson](http://journalsonline.tandf.co.uk/openurl.asp?genre=article&amp;id=doi:10.1080/15389580590931590) finds no detectable relationship between helmet-rates and on-road cycle safety in Great Britain. A [second article](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2005.03.020), also by Hewson (this one published in Accident Analysis and Prevention journal), reaches the same conclusion for child cyclists. Hewson emphasises that this doesn’t necessarily mean that helmets are ineffective; an alternative explanation is that there might be some benefits for particular groups and/or for particular types of cycling, and he points out that his own data cover on-road cycling only. However, he also argues that road safety professionals have no grounds for being involved in helmet promotion, given the lack of detectable benefits for on-road cyclists.

Another peer-reviewed paper on helmet laws in San Diego also finds no relationship between helmet-wearing rates and cycle safety.

Finally, a report on [children’s cycling from the National Children’s Bureau](http://www.ncb.org.uk/Page.asp?originx1444gb_23718458425669d91l2583383929) includes a very useful appendix surveying the literature on helmets. It states, “Those of us who cycle should be under no illusion that helmets offer reliable protection in crash situations where our lives may be in danger. Neither should we believe that widespread adoption of helmet wearing would see many fewer cyclists killed or permanently disabled. The evidence so far suggests otherwise.” Coming from a children’s charity, this is an important finding.  

This evidence all backs up the findings of a report from the SWOV Institute of Road Safety Research, The Netherlands in 2001, [Promotion of mobility and safety of vulnerable road users](http://www.swov.nl/rapport/d-2001-03.pdf) (final report of the European research project PROMISING), which says:

“5.4.7. helmets

From the point of view of restrictiveness, even the official promotion of helmets may have negative consequences for bicycle use. If the importance of wearing a helmet is stressed, the implied message is that cycling is extraordinarily dangerous. [...] To prevent helmets having a negative effect on the use of bicycles, the best approach is to leave the promotion to the manufacturers and shopkeepers.” 


Whilst, I think it is up to everybody to make their own decisions regarding helmet use, people should be aware of the growing body of research which shows that the implied safety the manufacturers and industry promote, isn't always true.

Stupefied by cultural relativism, we refuse to recognize that some ways of being in the world—our own especially—are superior to others.

Humanism is traditionally understood as stemming from the Italian Renaissance of the 16th c, but Morris provides persuasive evidence to suggest that it has deeper roots in an earlier Renaissance of the 12th c. His goal is essentially to delve into the roots of the modern conception of the individual/self, but that is closely connected to humanism. The interesting thing about it is that he locates the beginnings of thinking about a person as a separate entity from the community within emerging changes to Christian traditions as a response to being the dominant religion. For example, the standardization of confession in Church as a way to deal with individual intention (since the academics of the time in Europe relied largely on their knowledge of Latin without any (or with very little) Greek, Aristotle's look at intention in his ethics was unavailable, so the concept of intention as something separate from action was effectively new).

Now - I've lived in Europe and let me acquaint with some actual Reality about the EU countries:

- There is markedly less personal freedom there than in the US
- There is a far greater bureaucracy in place to get anything done
- The unions have a hammerlock on industry in many of these nations
- The per capita work output is smaller than that of a US citizen

Most importantly - most of these nations have enjoyed the ability to provide these cradle-to-grave Big Brother social services because ... wait for it ... for over 60 years it was the **USA** that paid the lion's share of their defense needs.  The US taxpayer was effectively subsidizing the social services of these nations by spending several trillions to make sure that the Soviets didn't walk all over Western Europe.   This freed up local funds for these programs that cause you to slobber all over yourself.

And, guess what?  The house of cards is collapsing.  As the burden of defense and economic reality set in on Europe, they have an unsustainable endgame of social services they cannot afford.  It's considerably worse than even the US situation with Medicare, for example.
