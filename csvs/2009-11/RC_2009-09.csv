&gt;Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler. Read a translated version (English) and have read the German version 1/3 (my German isn't very good).
He makes quite excellent points about rising international cultural and economic trends. When he wrote it, it was only starting. All of those things have unfortunately already come to pass in Western culture and it is probably beyond repair.
Another Excellent book is The International Jew (free online) by Henry Ford. This also contains a few good points but is lot older than Hitler’s book.
I read this long ago, but now that I see the Chapters again, everything springs back: Chapter 8: Jewish Influence in American Politics.
Chapter 15. The Battle for Press Control Does this sound familiar? All this was written almost a hundred years ago but still extremely relevant.
Other good books are several books by E.O. Wilson, Arthur Jensen, Rushton, Lynn, Steven Pinker, Vanhannen and others.

Oh sure, that's true.  But the worst case scenario is that they take over the Arab countries.  In that case our Iran problem is solved because we'd form an alliance of convenience.  Syria's dictatorship would probably fall to the caliphate, but that only solves one problem by creating another.  In the end I think the situation is workable.  All kinds of medium case scenarios would see low level conflict that may well settle down on its own someday.

I more think they'd be too busy poking women's eyes out for looking at books to pay much attention to continuing with terrorist attacks.  I see terrorism as a means to a political end.  If the end were achieved, I think the means would cease.

If Israel thinks Iran is going to suicidally launch a nuclear attack then they are wrong.    

&gt;There is no margin of error for the Israelis.

Israel practically invented real-politics.  They live and breath margin of error.  

&gt;If the Israelis go ahead and attack the military nuclear facilities in Iran, as they did in Iraq and Syria, there maybe consequences to everybody, not only to the Iranians and Israelis.

I don't see that as much of a possibility.  They'd need a go ahead from either the USA or Turkey to get to Iran and neither military has any interest in that happening.  If the USA decides to live with an Iranian bomb, Israel will too.  And if Israel really does go rogue, fly low over Kurdistan or whatever and bomb Iran against public and genuine American wishes, then I think Iran will limit its counter attack to Israel and spread it out over years or decades.

We are discovering more planets [nearly daily](http://exoplanet.eu/), while these are generally ""Hot Jupiter's"" (large hostile gas giants) it is becoming apparent that most stars have planets (even binary stars and neutron stars have been found with planets). 

We haven't found rocky planets within the Goldilocks zone (where liquid water - and therefore life as we know it - can exist) yet because up until [Keplar](http://kepler.nasa.gov/) we had no way to detect planets of this size.

Keplar is expected to confirm it's first earth sized planet in this zone in about 2 years - in which case the probability of life elsewhere will rocket - given the discovery of a new viable habitat.

Contrary to what you say, the chances of finding *another one* capable of sustaining complex (not basic) life is nearing certainty. In fact [Planet Quest](http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/) has even started it ""earthlike"" counter, still at zero at this time - but that will soon change.

In addition, within the last few years, water has been confirmed on [Mars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars#Hydrology), and [Enceladus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus_\(moon\)#Possible_water_ocean) [[BBC article]](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8115148.stm?uk) and most probably on [Europa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_\(moon\)#Subsurface_ocean) as well. 

The recent Hugens probe that landed on [Saturn's Moon Titan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_\(moon\)#Prebiotic_conditions_and_possible_life) discovered not an extremely simple but extremely complex moon rich in organics, complex molecules and polymers. To quote wikipedia: ""All of these experiments have led to the suggestion that enough organic material exists on Titan to start a chemical evolution analogous to what is thought to have started life on Earth.""

What's more - the recent discovery of seasonal Methane on Mars, could well be evidence for life.

So in fact while there is currently no direct evidence of life on any other world but our own, there are in fact lots of new discoveries that all point to the fact that life sustaining planets and/ or moons could be very abundant. The more we discover, the more apparent it becomes that the earth is not unique, and the chances of finding life elsewhere are getting better by the day.

In fact, predictions are that Keplar will find 100's of earth like planets, and may even detect the signatures of life in their [atmospheres](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/12/081208-carbon-exoplanet-life.html) within years.

&gt; The police's ""attack"" on the soldiers was with rubber bullets and tear gas - the bare minimum of what most countries would use to deter a thousand armed, angry people from storming parliament.

It is still an attack is it not?  Would you have supported the soldiers if they had arrived with their own riot gear, rubber bullets, and tear gas?

True,1426033811,1251778510,1,"&gt;How could that not be germane?? It's extremely pertinent to the topic at hand and point you're trying to make!

Technological improvements are valuable to a society for *long-term* advantage. Diamond's *Guns, Germs, and Steel* is a great examination of what differentiated European and East Asian societies from less developed cultures along those lines.

But that sort of value is not immediately obvious, and in either an immediate crisis situation, whether a natural disaster or a violent confrontation, or in the general *essential* tasks being done to both preserve a society from outside threats, and perform day-to-day tasks that are necessary to survival, the value of thinkers is not apparent. 

That's what I meant above, by skinny, nerdy males being similarly seen as inferior by more masculine males. In modern society, the role of the warrior may seem far less important, and a thinker more so, but many aspects of our culture, and I believe *our biology*, still see value in the expression of both physical and personal strength over weakness.

In business settings, social settings, and in mating, both physical strength and personal strength are seen as desirable qualities. A man who has an athletic or muscular figure will appear more dominant than one who is short or underweight. And one who speaks confidently, with a deep, firm voice, likewise appears more charismatic and                                                                                                                          garners more influence. Similarly, these are traits many women appear to respond to positively. 

So no, being able to provide a non-obvious, long-term benefit to a society, whether it's developing a sharper flint spearhead, or developing a cure for cancer, when different groups look at each other superficially (as we all do at first glance, or more continually for those who are not deep thinkers), is not especially relevant to the question.

&gt;You keep saying that men are stronger, but then you say they are disposable. So which is it?

*Both.* The warrior-hunter is expected to be stronger and tougher so as to defend the tribe, and be the first to lay down his life if necessary to do so. This remains true today on both the front lines of the military, in the police, in fire-fighters, search &amp; rescue. *Not exclusively, obviously some women pursue those roles.* But still dominantly. And overwhelmingly, as I mentioned elsewhere, men are still the ones who go into lines of work where there is significant danger of injury and death. If men are doing jobs like mining, logging, and construction, and women of the same education &amp; social class are doing jobs like waitressing, clerking, cashiering, is it surprising that these men might think ""we're doing the dirty jobs, because someone's got to, but the women get the cushy jobs.""

Please note I'm not trying to defend sexism. I'm positing *where these beliefs about superiority/inferiority arise from*. 

The skinny nerd may in fact himself believe he (or she) is inferior to those with less intelligence. But thrown into a wilderness survival situation, ancient roles based on physique and gender may quickly reestablish themselves.

Do all men believe they are superior to all women? No, nor should they. But do *some* men, based on the belief, or possibly even primal instinct, that it is their basic job to be protector and life-risker, while others are free to display their fear, or emotions, and shrink back and let others take the risks in their place, because of their lower strength, or crucial role as mother? Quick possibly. I'm not arguing that such a belief is justified: it's clearly misplaced in a society striving for equality. But wouldn't it help that struggle to understand its nature and origin, in order to better address it?

This attitude can also explain much of homophobia. Behaviors displayed by gay men: femininity, effeteness, are seen as the antithesis of *what a man should be like*, and so such men are seen as failing to do what other men are simply expected to do.

For a double hit make a spinach and walnut (see below) salad. Add any other ingredients of your choice.
Nuts

Walnuts, Brazil Nuts, Hazelnuts, Pecans. Brilliant as a snack instead of chocolate or sweets. Toast slightly under grill for a great taste.
Seeds

Choose a seeded roll when you go shopping. Sesame seeds also complement any slightly sweet or spicy chilli dressing.
Tahini

Tahini is a sesame seed paste that is used itself as a dip, and also as a base for some Middle Eastern sauces such as curries, as a 'roux' would be in European cooking.
Houmous

A great tasting chickpea dip (one of my favourites) – made with a tahini base!
Oils

Soya Bean Oil, Canola Oil, Rapeseed Oil, Linseed/Flaxseed Oil. Most of these can be found in your local supermarket. Experiment when cooking, marinating and dressing.""

As far as what specific information the intelligence community had (and which agencies were involved with this information) I honestly don't know. I'm not sure if any of it has been publicly released either, but I haven't gone out of my way to look for this information. I doubt President Bush claimed that he personally gathered the intel himself, or got congress and half of Europe to believe it with a wink and a ""trust me"". I can give you a bit of Iraq's history with WMDs though.

Iraq certainly had WMDs in the 80s, this fact has never been in dispute. Saddam frequently deployed chemical weapons on Kurdish civilians. He was also developing biological and nuclear weaponry. After the Persian Gulf War in the early 90s, the UN (UNSCOM) went in and started dismantling much of the equipment used to develop these weapons. By 1998 Iraq had become quite uncooperative with UN weapons inspectors, so President Clinton bombed the shit out of them (see [Operation Desert Fox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Desert_Fox)). The weapons inspectors were recalled during this to avoid getting bombed by their own team, and UNSCOM was dissolved. Over the next few years Saddam repeatedly refused to let UN weapons inspectors in, until Resolution 1441 was passed in 2002. 

As for why there were none when the US got there, there might not have been much left after UNSCOM and Operation Desert Fox was done with them. Some of the feet-dragging might have been ""FUCK! THE COPS ARE HERE, FLUSH THE SHIT!"". My guess is that even though they didn't have many (or any) WMDs, they didn't want their neighbors to know that that they didn't.

Jews were losing their rights and being put in concentration camps since before the war has even begun.  They were being killed in Ghettos far before the Germans were losing.

&gt; England would have lost her colonies resulting in the freedom of a few 100 million people.

Freedom? The Germans openly planned to use race as a basis for status of peoples. And they openly planned to enslaving most of Europe to their own ""higher race"".

&gt; The Palestinians would not have lost their land (al-Nakba would not have happened). This would probably have resulted in a lot more moderate Muslims.

This is bullshit for 2 reasons:

 * Israel was already in the process of being created since 1890, and many of the lands and a decent military were in Israeli hands before WWII.

 * You actually believe the Muslims of the world are extremists because of Israel.  This is an excuse used by many Islamists and Arab leaders in order to divert attention away from their failing regimes so that they can blame an external enemy.  If you think Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan would be any less extremist Muslims if Israel hadn't been created, you're extremely naive.

&gt; Furthermore, people in the 3rd world would not have to look to China or Russia with help to throw off the colonialist shackles.

England pretty much left their colonies not much after WWII (e.g India in 1947). What are you talking about here?

&gt; Communism in Eastern Europe would have been contained. Saving another 100 million or so people from half a century of communism.

Instead of Communism, you would have Fascism, which is far worse.  A totalitarian leader was had by both, but Germany's system openly called for race-based extermination and slavery.  Read about their ""Race theories"".

You are either extremely naive, or extremely ignorant, or both.

This is enough to get you covered on ALL life threatening or other important surgeries, checks and even most of medicine is free.. IF YOU WISH (I dont use this myself ) additional 30$ per month and you get virtually all your costs covered including any number of days hospital care etc..The old people,disabled or poor are actually most taken care of by  so called socialised insurance - that anyone is taking this death panels in USA serious is just sad, not even funny anymore... I remember once traveling to some third world country without any kind of travel insurance (stupid, i know)  and I needed a life saving operation that cost me  $2000. When I came home my government  paid me back everything since all ""life threatening situations"" are covered by  basic (which I wasn't even paying since gov paid if for me) insurance! You can fucking call it nazi or comunist insurance I dont give a shit - it costs me few hamburgers monthly (if you cant afford it or you work then you dont even pay for it!) while you are having stories like this posted daily on reddit!

I heard that Americans dont like to ""pay"" for others   - thats fucking selfish and stupid! Actually the fact that everybody has to pay something makes it more cheap since it is divided among so many people. I fucking gladly pay (actually in most cases individuals are not even paying it - companies or gov is paying it for you)for ""others"" people insurance since they pay it back for me.  So Americans would rather pay large amounts of money and have millions of people uninsured than pay less and have everybody insured! As long as you are not ""giving"" something to someone...fucking winning mentality!

Here is the truth: there is not a SINGLE country in the world that has ANY kind of government/socialized health care that would trade it for your kind of health insurance!Incidentally, if my memory serves me correct, there are no developed countries in the world that would not have some kind of gov health insurance. 

But no, be selfish pricks and pay thousands of dollars for greedy corporations.fuck the guy next door and if he has die or to sell the house to cover med costs (unimaginable in other countries than US)  - you are NOT going to ""subsidize"" his health care!

Except for Illinois, which decriminalized sodomy in 1961, homosexual acts, even between consenting adults acting in private homes, were a criminal offense in every U.S. state at the time the Stonewall Riots occurred: ""An adult convicted of the crime of having sex with another consenting adult in the privacy of his or her home could get anywhere from a light fine to five, ten, or twenty years—or even life—in prison. In 1971, twenty states had 'sex psychopath' laws that permitted the detaining of homosexuals for that reason alone. In Pennsylvania and California sex offenders could be locked in a mental institution for life, and [in] seven states they could be castrated.""

“I had a Danish on the train.” That’s what I’ll tell Marta when she meets me at the train station. I was traveling to Budapest after my junior year of college to go to my former roommate’s wedding. She was always telling me to eat more. For some reason I don’t think this is what she had in mind.

I smiled around the hard cock in my mouth at the thought. The rhythmic sway of the train car added to the bobbing of my head as I sucked deeply. My hands were braced on Erik’s hips to keep us in synch. I didn’t want to cause any permanent damage because we hit some rough track. Erik’s feet were propped up on the facing seat behind me as I knelt between his jeans encased thighs. His friend Joren was watching us. I gazed at him in the dim light from the moon as I slid my hands under Erik’s balls.

Erik lifted his hips to slide his jeans down farther. While not too tall, he was in great shape from tramping across Europe for the summer. His hair was on the scruffy side, but he was clean. Something I couldn’t say for a lot of the other students in the Munich train station. I enjoyed the musky scent as I nuzzled his belly and pulled his cock deeply into my mouth. I enjoyed teasing the underside of his shaft with my tongue as I slid my mouth up and down along its length. My breasts rubbed against the insides of his thighs, hardening my nipples. I wished that I could finger myself as I brought him to his climax.

Marta would be proud of me if she could see me now. She told me I should come to Europe and loosen up a bit. I don’t think I could feel looser than I do right now, sucking off a guy that I didn’t know eight hours ago.

Joren said something to Erik I didn’t understand and they both laughed. Danish was funny to my ears. Erik’s laugh ended in a moan as I fondled his balls and swallowed around his cock head. I could see Joren’s hard-on through his jeans. He was rubbing two thick fingers along the length. Where Erik was just lean, Joren was long and lean. When Erik moaned, grabbing my long hair and pressing his hips up into my face Joren unbuttoned his fly and pulled out his cock. My eyes widened as he wrapped his fist around his swollen cock and pumped it while watching us.

Erik’s eyes slid closed on another groan. I could feel his dick swelling up as my swallowing and his hip pumping synched. My mouth watered in anticipation of being filled with his cum. His balls drew up and I knew he was close. I increased the tempo of my swallowing, driving him to his climax. I wanted to finish Erik before Joren finished himself.

It must be the decadent European air. I’ve become an “easy American”.

As that thought flew through my brain, Erik shuddered and I felt his cum push up through his cock and into my mouth. He called out loudly. My lips pressed tightly around his shaft to keep all his juices in my mouth. I savored the hot salty liquid sliding over my palate and down my throat. I focused on swallowing in time to each burst. As his shuddering subsided I smiled around his cock and lightly teased his balls.

His head dropped back on the seat with his eyes closed. “So fucking good, Maggie.” 

“Glad you liked it,” I chuckled, dropping his cock out of my mouth with a slight slurp. 

Joren was still fisting his shaft. I reached over to run my finger through the bead of precum on the tip of his swollen cock. Our eyes locked. He grabbed my wrist and pulled me up from between Erik’s legs and over to him. He again said something to Erik. Erik replied and grabbed my ass.

I leaned forward to lap at the tip of Joren’s dick, giving Erik better access to lifting the full skirt I was traveling in. Joren filled his hands with my tits as my hair curtained around my head. His cock was bigger around than Erik’s, and I didn’t know if I would be able to suck him off for long. I had come to Europe for new experiences. Sucking off two strangers in a train car would definitely count as one.

I moaned as Erik worked his fingers under my wet panties, my lips stretching around Joren’s cock and my tongue
thrashing side to side. He was so hard already. He must have enjoyed watching me suck off Erik. All thought flew from my mind as Erik slid two fingers into my wet pussy. I pressed my hips back into his hand in response. He laughed and began to pump them in and out of me. I had never imagined how good being finger fucked could be.

The train entered a tunnel, plunging the cabin into total darkness. All that existed for me was Joren’s huge, hard dick in my mouth and my throbbing pussy being fucked with Erik’s fingers. The scent of sex and our moans filled the car. The three of us rocked in time to the train on the tracks. When Joren pinched my nipples, my walls convulsed around Erik’s fingers, my climax ripping through me. My whole body shook with pleasure as I groaned deeply and sucked harder at Joren’s delicious dick.

No sooner did I climax than he bucked up into my face, his balls drawing up and his shaft swelling even bigger. I pulled myself back from almost blacking out and gripped his thighs as he splashed his cum into my mouth. Again, I swallowed rapidly, devouring his cock and cum at once. There was so much cum that it leaked out around my mouth, but I don’t think Joren minded.

The train pulled into the open again as Joren’s cock and my pussy stopped twitching. I felt my knees go to Jello. The fatigue from traveling from Atlanta to Munich to the middle of Austria was overcoming me. Erik caught me and pulled me up to the seat between him and Joren, before licking his fingers. He had a big grin on his face to match the one on Joren’s. I felt the grin on my face and knew I looked just as dopey.

The guys pushed their cocks back into their jeans and zipped up. I fixed my skirt and blouse. Erik pulled my head to rest against his shoulder.

(Sorry for this long-winded response, but it's probably the only general comment I'll make under this article.)

 Sounds like an OK idea on the surface --  but how  much extra would everyone have to pay for it, or would participation in the program be voluntary?

And anyhow,how much will we all be paying, with or without a new government health plan, through eternally rising prices (dropping dollar), after the big cash giveaway to all the millionaire bankers?

In the name of small government, _our favorite Congressman_ has suggested that even Social Security ought to be voluntary participation, instead of mandatory for everyone. 

I would hope that there would still be the ability/right to opt out of any government-run plan, or to have only a limited participation, if one so chooses.

(And my rant continues...)

It's strange that the politicians can piss away all that money on the war machine, but they are still going to make us all pay,one way or another,  for (corporate-sponsored) 'health care.' 
 
But then, I'm not someone who automatically goes running to the western doctors believing everything they say, given the major controls exerted by Big Pharma, on the FDA and perhaps the entire medical profession.  

But on the other, other hand, it sounds like a good idea, based upon what many European countries have done -- but I still fear it is too much corporatism and big government, and that the pharmaceutical firms and many doctors/surgeons would continue to charge exorbitant prices, gouging the public (much as they do now), now with a guaranteed support fro the government. 

We should note that the present system is NOT a free market, and that a 'free market', at least in the ideal way that  the 'Austrian School' economists describes it, has never happened in the US -- at least not for a very long time. 

So I can sort of see why many people imagine that anything done by the central government to change the system will only make it worse! 

It's hard to ignore the fact that,following the war criminals/traitors Bush and Cheney,we now have a guy who immediately gave  away all those billions of dollars to super-wealthy bankers.

Here's the thing, and my main beef with the feds. Human organizations do not scale well. Small businessmen are great - everyone says ""support your local farmer"" and so on, but everyone hates monstrous corporations -and for good reason. Once an organization gets past a certain size, it simply becomes impossible for it to maintain a ""people first"" attitude or even for it to operate efficiently. Look at GM and Chrysler. Look at how the Japanese automakers are becoming stodgy and less able innovate (sure, they're better than the Americans, but they're becoming less so every day).

Look at how Google is evolving from ""don't be evil"" to ""you have no privacy"". Look at how Apple has changed from the scrappy underdog to the company that tells you what you can and cannot put on your telephone.

Now, look at health care: There are **no** national healthcare systems that manage 300 million people. The largest of the European countries is not that much larger than California. Asking the feds to create a single health care system for 300 million people makes as much sense as saying that a single minimum wage is correct for both Iowa and New York City. (The cost of living is the same in Manhattan and Des Moines? Seriously?)

So, why not? Why not let Californians decide what kind of health care they want, and let them fund it. For poorer states, sure we would probably need some sort of federal assistance but, again, that's a very different principle from trying to define a single health care system that can handle every variation in need from Nome to Key West - and if one of the states fuck it up, they'll have 49 other examples to choose from on how to do it better. People like oddmanout are convinced that we can get this right in one try. How often does that actually happen, in the real world?

[Here's what Wikipedia says about my country's healthcare system:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care#Taiwan_.28Republic_of_China.29)
&gt;Taiwan’s citizens no longer have to worry about going bankrupt due to medical bills.[62]
Under this model, citizens have free range to choose hospitals and physicians without using a gatekeeper and do not have to worry about waiting lists. NHI offers a comprehensive benefit package that covers preventive medical services, prescription drugs, dental services, Chinese medicine, home nurse visits and many more. Working people do not have to worry about losing their jobs or changing jobs because they will not lose their insurance. Since NHI, the previously uninsured have increased their usage of medical services. Most preventive services are free such as annual checkups and maternal and child care. Regular office visits have co-payments as low as US $5 per visit. Co-payments are fixed and unvaried by the person’s income.[63]

Keep in mind that Taiwan makes the same as the average EU nation, so things are very expensive yet we are able to achieve this (no Sarah Palin ""Death Councils"" or Waiting Lists, or other bullshit). Why not America? Taiwan only spends a third of GDP PPP versus America.

&gt;During his second voyage, Columbus and his men instituted a policy in Hispaniola which has been referred to by numerous historians as genocide. The native Taino people of the island were systematically enslaved and murdered. Hundreds were rounded up and shipped to Europe to be sold; many died en route. For the rest of the population, Columbus demanded that all Taino under his control should bring the Spaniards gold. Those who didn't were to have their hands cut off. Since there was, in fact, little gold to be had, the Taino fled, and the Spaniards hunted them down and killed them. The Taino tried to mount a resistance, but the Spanish weaponry was superior, and European diseases ravaged their population. In despair, the Taino engaged in mass suicide, even killing their own children to save them from the Spaniards. Within two years, half of what may have been 250,000 Taino were dead. The remainder were taken as slaves and set to work on plantations, where the mortality rate was very high. By 1550, 60 years after Columbus landed, only a few hundred Taino were left on their island. In another hundred years, perhaps only a handful remained.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus#Third_voyage

&gt;Columbus returned to Hispaniola on 19 August to find that many of the Spanish settlers of the new colony were discontented, having been misled by Columbus about the supposedly bountiful riches of the new world. An entry in his journal from September 1498 reads, ""From here one might send, in the name of the Holy Trinity, as many slaves as could be sold..."" Indeed, as a fierce supporter of slavery, Columbus ultimately refused to baptize the native people of Hispaniola, since Catholic law forbade the enslavement of Christians.

&gt;Columbus repeatedly had to deal with rebellious settlers and natives. He had some of his crew hanged for disobeying him. A number of returning settlers and sailors lobbied against Columbus at the Spanish court, accusing him and his brothers of gross mismanagement. On his return he was arrested for a period (see Governorship and arrest section below).

&gt;Maybe we should not. Let take this scenario: Israelis hit Iran; Iran closes the Straights, the Americans force its reopening. The Iranians are trying to hit Israel from Lebanon through Hezbollah without success. The Lebanese get hit hard on their infrastructure and the majority blames Hezbollah for getting Lebanon in a war that they do not want. Syria is attacked when Hezbollah starts the war; Hezbollah looses the support of the most of the Shia in Lebanon. The Assad regime crumbles, the Iranian regime crumbles. Seems to me that most of the heavy lifting is on the Israelis and not a lot on the Americans...

That's why I don't think Iran will close the straights.  If they can keep the USA out of the fight then the regime can survive.  

&gt;What is the basis of this assessment? Why do you think the Israelis cannot win a conventional war?

I don't think Israel could conquer and occupy Iran.  I mean, they could barely hold their own against Hezbollah a couple years back.  Iran has a real army.  

The other problem is that everyone in the area hates both Iran and Israel.  When Iraq and Iran fought a war most of the countries in the region and really the world said ""fucking awesome.  I wonder how long we can keep this going.""  The USA sold arms to both sides for example.  If Iran and Israel were fighting the Arab countries would be saying ""the people we hate are killing each other?  No way, count my lucky stars...""  European countries don't exactly hate Israel, but wouldn't lose any sleep over shit getting blown up there.  

So I think the end result would be a protracted and bloody conflict that leaves both countries in ruin.  But I don't think it would change the government or borders of either nation.  Unless, of course, Israel goes nuclear.  I don't think there would be long term consequences in diplomatic relations.  When Iraq used WMD on Iran no one really cared.

That's 1.24 acres per person for food security, diversity, and:

You also don't take into account climate, and that families in Maine can produce far less than families in Georgia, etc.

The fact that you can now sit there and complain about us at all is a  direct consequence of a continuous US policy of *preemptive intervention* in the region - your region - for some 60 years or so.  Sadly, modern Europeans have fallen in love with a kind of leftthink that says the sand dwellers are not similarly entitled to freedom.  Nothing new there - racial bigotry as a long and tired history both in the UK and on the Continent.

OH, and it is not prejudice that drives the observation about the militant Islamists overtaking Europe.

You and people like you deserve to have your culture pillaged, your laws undermined, and your freedoms savaged for you are too morally and intellectually weak to be in possession of so great a gift as freedom.  Sadly, in lapsing into Eurostan, the many good and decent folk of the region will also be similarly violated.

First off, IMO (and I know that many people might not share this opinion) that there should be a common test for web standards (kinda like the acid test, but more robust and accredited by the W3C with annual revisions for the test) which says that all browser vendors, if they want to be included by default, HAVE to pass xx% of the score in the test. 

While almost everything I have mentioned that MS did is *technically* legal, I think it was unfair (in the non-legal sense) and probably evil business practices.

I agree with you that Apple is just as evil, actually, IMO, its even more so. However, they do not have a monopoly, and are not acting in an evil manner when it comes to browsers (Except for their marketing, which is ridiculously over the top, claiming the invent features others have invented before them)

I'm really not surprised at the results of this survey.

I work with a lot of foreign people, including a lot of interns. They come from all over Europe; primarily Germany, Spain, Austria and France; but also a lot of other countries. I live and work in Brighton, a lovely seaside city which has a huge international student population at any given time of year, due to the number of English language schools as well as its welcoming atmosphere. I'm interested in languages and other cultures, and I often end up chatting to the interns about their lives in Brighton, as well as before and after.

The general consensus is that interns generally fall in love with the city... but cannot believe the incredibly bad drinking problem they've noticed amongst young British people. Every single intern says the same thing, sadly. It's horrible to see with scary regularity - on a weekday night, no less - inebriated teenagers hanging out on street corners swigging bottles of Lambrini and cans of cheap lager, cigarettes hanging from mouths, generally being loud, boisterous, and violent among one another and insulting anybody who happens to be unlucky enough to have to walk by. Horrible.

It's unbelievably depressing, and the worst thing is that I know from spending a few years in Nottingham that Brighton is really the thin end of the wedge.

As much as I love this city (I grew up here), I cannot wait until next year, when I plan to going travelling around the world. The problem was never this bad when I was younger, but for some reason it has escalated to a ridiculous level in the last 5-10 years.

I disagree.  The situation is different.  For a start, unlike the Iran-Iraq war, Israel and Iran do not share a border.  I never said that Israel will or can invade Iran.  It will not; so whatever military conflagration will be from remote.  Same thing happened in 1982 Iraq; What were Saddam's options after the destruction of the Osirak reactor?  Using his Palestinian terrorists minions or invading Jordan and from there on to Israel.

&gt;So I think the end result would be a protracted and bloody conflict that leaves both countries in ruin.

I do not see it that way.  The only way for Iran is to move army to Syria and push Assad towards a war with Israel.  If Bashir does that, he is a total idiot because his and the Allawite clan control of Syria will be at stake.

The only way for Iran to respond is by terrorism either overseas (we had the Buenos Aires precedent) or into Israel through Gaza (Hamas learned a lesson last December) or through Lebanon (see my previous comments).

I do not see a lot of options for the Iranians (and for the Israelis) except starting a missile war across Iraq and Jordan.  

Bottom line: if the Israelis attack, they will probably delay for a number of years the Iranian A-Bomb.  That will be probably enough to get the Ayatollahs under stress economically and politically.

Therefore, no one should do ""x"". I will enforce this view with the power of the state.

Hahaha... so anyone arguing against you is either illogical or simple minded? 

&gt; Sounds to me like someone taking issue with a hypocritical stance on drugs (not full legalization) that doesn't actually make drugs non-lucrative to organized crime.

Yes, maybe you should read more than just one of his quotes. He's one of the biggest critics of drug tourism. He isn't pushing a full on ban even though he's publicly stated that's what he'd prefer. He recognizes people will use it underground anyways, so he says provide legitimate routes instead. However, he also points out the drug tourism is a horrible problem. That's what we're discussing here.

He thinks the current law is shit and wants to either have official methods for supplying the shops or full prohibition. He's on the record stating he prefers full prohibition. So I guess that makes him simple minded or illogical in your book, that he can recognize both points of view and still desire prohibition.

It seems I can throw facts at you all day and you're still not going to admit there's any problem whatsoever. You're nitpicking everything presented to you like a creationist looking over the fossil record, dismissing it outright rather than looking at the bigger picture.

&gt; The 1,700 police in the South Limburg force say they spend more than 80 per cent of their time dealing with drug- related crime. Since the explosion of synthetic drugs some three years ago the problems have escalated, particularly thefts and muggings.

&gt; The Maastricht police have closed five or six coffee shops in the past year, chiefly because the neighbours have complained about the noise.

&gt; The problem is not the Dutch but the foreigners. Outsiders blame the Netherlands' over-liberal laws, but Chief Commissioner Henk Mostert, who has to enforce them, says this is unfair. In the three years he has been trying to contain the drug problem in the province, the explosion in drug-abuse has been among non-Dutch citizens. The number of Dutch addicts has remained static for almost a decade.

&gt; The rate of drugs crime in Maastricht has increased by 17% in the last year.

&gt; The council in Maastricht plans to make it technically illegal to serve foreigners in the city's 16 coffee shops, a move that could drive many of them out of business. Spurred on by complaints from police and residents, the Mayor of Maastricht, Geerd Leers, has decided that enough is enough. If Mr Leers gets his way, a new by-law will soon require all those who visit coffee shops to show identity cards proving that they are residents. Initially, the law will be enforced only in one coffee shop which will, if necessary, take the case all the way to the European Court of Justice. But, if it loses, foreigners could be banned for all 750 coffee shops in the Netherlands.

&gt; Peter Tans, head of communications for the Maastricht police, says that, of the estimated 21,000 people charged with crimes this year in south Limburg, 4,500 will be foreigners.

&gt; More alarmingly, the police fear that this subculture is making Maastricht fertile territory for gangs dealing in hard drugs. Between January and October 2005, police in the city made 193 arrests in 23 raids, seizing 10kg of heroin, 1.5kg of cocaine, 12,000 ecstasy tablets, €171,000 in cash and 11 firearms.

&gt; Mr Tans says: ""It can't go on like it has been for several years now. We hope that [the city's] experiment will be successful because the problems here give us a huge workload.

You dismiss everything else as illogical or simple minded without presenting any of your own logic. You even go so far as to tell me I shouldn't attempt logic. Don't think for myself?  You simply tell me it's not true and it's just a right-wing agenda but you provide ZERO information to back this up this ""right-wing"" agenda theory.

I point out one negative effect of decriminalization when it's surrounded by areas where it is still criminalized, and for that I'm called illogical. This leaves the impression on me that quite a bit of the legalization movement is blind-sided to any legitimate discussion.

True,1426034520,1251844584,1,"Hey, look, don't think that I'm not very aware of WW2 and America's role. Google for the details of the Marshall Plan; in short it was the idea that a prosperous united Europe would make NATO far stronger. And it did. The US spent a fortune restoring EU agriculture and industry to a level that surpassed the pre-war level. Not many people know this by the way, on either side of the Atlantic.

And also don't think for a moment I don't like America or it's people. Actually, I love you guys and I'm glad Bush is gone and I can visit again without feeling dirty. But that leads me to the problem; the US government has changed completely in the past 60 years. It runs counter to most of the ideals that America once held strongly. Unelected bodies are effectively running the show and their interests are not the same as the populations. The population have a justified distrust in government, with both parties being very much ""big government"" in their actions, if not in their talk. This is all fixable and I can promise you; the only reason I'm a bit aggressive online is to try and slap some sense into you. And I'm not even saying that the average American needs this more than any nation; the people where I am have about the same limited perspective of global affairs. If I didn't care about America I would just mind my own business.

Muslims in Europe don't want a global Islamic Caliphate. If they wanted to live under those laws they wouldn't have come here. They sure as hell didn't come to the UK for the weather or the food. Muslim kids here in the UK drink and take drugs just as much as everyone else does. They have sex out of wedlock and could make a sailor blush with their cursing. Most mix with the ""white kids"" and I have many ""Muslim"" friends myself. Not one of them is in the least bit religious, let alone extremist. 

You might feel that there is an overwhelming urge to ""take over"" because our media has a continuing array of extremists who are only too happy to use the platform to speak their mind. But this is very unfair; it would be exactly like Al Jazeera going to David Duke or Timothy McVay for the ""Christian"" viewpoint. Folk like Fred Phelps have made their opinions very clear and their goal to spread their interpretation of scripture is also global. Their views are identical to the Muslim extremists in every single respect. How would you feel if Iranian TV was hunting these people down and presenting them to the Iranians as the regular point of view of America and the west? Yet that's precisly what our media is doing. It's not malicious, it's just good TV and great for ratings. Who doesn't want to see a man with a hook for a hand going nuts on live TV?

All these groups of global domination of their beliefs and the death of those who oppose them. In reality, the vast majority of Muslims are like the vast majority of Christians; they are Muslim in name alone. They don't care. They just want to live in peace. 

Here in Europe, WW2 taught us a few lessons. Firstly, war sucks. America doesn't yet realize this; 9/11 was the only notable attack on the mainland and most of the people don't realize the fear and anger they felt on that one day is what it feels like for everyone in war every single day. This breeds hatred in a way that's hard to replicate by any other means. If terrorism is your enemy then you cannot win this way against it. For every one you kill, two brothers/uncles or friends become radicalized. By fighting it head on you only feed the extremists who talk of jihad. 

Secondly, every kid here is taught extensively about the Holocaust and the feelings of racial hatred that enabled it. This is why you will never see me personally speak out against a whole group. Many of us view the vilification of the Muslim as the exact same as the vilification of the Jew. 

Now, why am I suggesting the US is directly to blame for some of this? The extremest Muslim view was nurtured by America during the cold war. It is a side effect from the protection you mentioned in the start of your comment. So not only is the US government responsible for helping promote extremism today, it played a key role in it's inception. 

Finally, you mention a future of Sharia law, birkas and honor killings. This is where the ""US Good Guy"" argument falls over. The US government, most notably the last administration, are best friends with these people in Saudi Arabia. And I think this gets to the crux of the argument; it's not fighting extremism, it's fighting *select* extremism for other strategic reasons. It speaks of freedom and democracy yet has a track record that (outside of the EU) is far more aligned with dictatorships. Both South America and the Middle East have suffered greatly from US supported dictatorships, in many cases with the US being influential in installing that dictatorship at the cost of an existing democracy. Imagine what Iran would be like today had their secular 50s democracy not been disposed of, replaced by the Shah and then the extremists. Sure, their oil fields would have been nationalized harming oil profits for influential corporations in America, but the chances are that a wealthy, non-extremist democracy in Iran would be the ""beacon of democracy"" that was once mentioned as one of the many lies made to the US population regarding the invasion of Iraq.

I commend memri.org to your attention if you want to hear what the Islamists of the Middle East, at least, are saying in their own language - it's sobering.)

Also, you have your history confused on who did what to the Muslims when.  Prior to the Brits slapping the Ottomans around, there was a decidedly pro-Jewish sentiment in the halls of power in the UK.  Once oil flowing, there was a distinct turning away from the Jews and towards the Arabs in UK policy aided in some measure by T.E. Lawrence's scribblings (see: http://www.radicalacademy.com/pollawrenceofarabia.htm)  By the time WWII came along, the anti-Jewish sentiment was so strong that Jews escaping from Hitler's death camps to the UK in the early going were *returned* to Germany by the UK authorities.   In supporting the Muslims blindly, the UK gave voice to some really bad actors, aided and abetted by the insane partitioning plane they came up with when they left.  It is fair to say that in the post-Analusian history of Islam it has been a steady freight train towards increasing violence, decreasing tolerance, and THAT is why they are villified so much today, not because the US made it all up to suit its policy agenda.

As to fighting select extremism, there is an element of truth in what you say, but its not some kind of evil plan, but rather simple reality: You have to fight the most imminent threats first.  The Saudis are primarily a threat to themselves, not to us.  But the unholy trio of Iran, Iraq, and Syria are or were a threat to everyone.  Instead of hating Bush, you should be rejoicing that he neutered the 5th largest army in the world and took out a Stalinesque dictator.  There's be more of this to follow if the US didn't have such an Idiot President at the moment.  Obama is missing the opportunity of a lifetime that would feed his immense ego needs forever: He could drop the hammer on the Middle East and dictate the terms of peace to all the players simply by prying Iran open - Bush gave him all the tools he needs to do this.  Unfortunately, Obama is to poisoned by the puerile left ideology he's inhaled over the years and will never do this.  The result?  Probable nuclear confrontation between Israel and Iran within 50 years (or way less) barring a remarkable event.

The Slovaks thought they were a junior partner in Czechoslovakia, which is why that partnership broke up.   And it doesn't help that the Germans and Russians banged all over the place through Central and Eastern Europe at the end of WW2 pushing all sorts of peoples around.  

Then, after the war, the Soviets, in large measure on purpose, kept all their Eastern European ""allies"" from dealing with internal ethnic issues constructively.... so that it would be easier for the Soviets to control them, as well as so they could say ""there are no ethnic problems in the workers paradise"".  

Of course, even going back to before all this... The area has been pulled this way and that by all the various great powers to play in the area. Parts of which were part of the Roman Empire and more parts of which never were.    And it was the highway that peoples from central Asia had to pass through if they wanted to go from the Eurasian Step and raid the Roman Empire.   So, lots of folks from many ethnic groups dropped out there, or bounced back there.... when folks like the Huns, Goths, Alans, Vandals, decided to make a charge at Rome.   Or even before Rome, one finds Celtic groups going the other way to raid Greek/Macedonian lands. 

Then more were part of the Holy Roman Empire, or later Austrian Empire.  Plus the opposition groups to the HRE -- one of the big firsts in the area actually being the Kingdom of Hungary.  But later other powers played through, including the Eastern Roman Empire (Greeks mainly), Ottoman Turks, Prussians (later morphed in Germany proper), Sweden (yes, boys and girls... Sweden was once a great power), Russia, Poland when she was having a good century every once in a while, and even for a brief time the Mongols.  

But a lot of these are issues that still have to be sorted out in Eastern Europe -- just like other places.  Like I was saying before, it was because the Soviets didn't allow it for a while, and in the immediate days after the fall of the USSR, people there thought the new Democratic Capitalist system might be a panacea because... Well, it's a lot of tough issues and people like the idea of a panacea being a cure all cause it means they don't need to do anything -- so they gave it a try for a while.

This is not a uniquely American problem or ideology with regards to militias and secessionists. In fact, it was essentially bred into the hearts and minds of Americans to distrust the government from the very start.

&gt;I'm dying to hear the examples for Sweeden, Japan and Norway.

Sweden: in the early 1600s the Riksdag (parliament) seized estates from every Catholic in the country and essentially banished them as a lower class of citizen. Read up on many wars they involved themselves in to snatch up land in Europe [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_Monarchy_in_Sweden) and [here](http://www.economicexpert.com/a/Sweden:and:the:Great:Northern:War.htm). 

Japan: There are many incidents of Japanese oppression of Korea from assassinations to massive protests suppression. Found a whole article devoted to [Japanese warcrimes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes).

Norway: The unification of Norway came about due to Halfdan and Harald conquering many smaller kingdoms and banishing or killing the current rulers. I will admit that not much can be confirmed due to the lack of proper record keeping as most is from almost mythical stories and such. 

The point being is that any country, going back far enough, has their fair share of closet skellies. 

The reason I defend America is because we catch so much slack for being in the spotlight during this time in history. Any other empire or country in history that was considered the ""superpower"" also meddled in other countries' affairs. Yet again, this is not excusable. I don't defend America's methods, only that they have not set some completely new precedent. It's a sad state of humanity that the most powerful nations must defend that ""superpower"" status at the expense of others. One day I hope our or some other nation can rise above that petty need.

I appreciate the challenge to search those countries' histories.

 However, the discussion is keep the current system intact but if anywhere in your lineage there was citizenship X then you're a citizen of that country. It kind of defeats the purpose, go back far enough in my family tree and I assume I could be a citizen anywhere in Europe.

 As for the exploits, I figure those were pretty obvious. We have socialized healthcare, cheap schools and the like. Your idea makes concepts like immigration non-existant as people can just come and go as they please. 

 Schools are hard enough to get into with current requirements and plenty of people from outside of Canada attending because even a 200% markup is still a cheaper alternative for them. If anyone can just move their kids here, pay for school cheaply and leave less openings for people who actually live here and pay taxes there's an issue. 

 Let's talk about healthcare and our neighbours to the south. I'd be willing to guess 20% of americans could dig deep enough to find some form of canadian heritage in their family. What happens when they start popping over the border constantly to save on medical fees and prescriptions?

What does it say about the US's already staggeringly high unemployment rate if I could just move there tomorrow and apply for a job, bypassing all the red tape. 

What does it say about trade if I can claim citizenship and bring X amount of dollars of stuff across borders without fee's or tariffs, claiming I'm just moving back and forth between my two homes?

Those are just a few off the top of my head. I just don't think it's logical to pretend citizenship does nothing. Otherwise why would people care so much to lose it? On top that it's just I don't even find the rules that agressive or crazy like implied: 

""Oh you were living out of the country a bit and had a kid there? No problem! They can still be a citizen"". ""Oh, your kid who you had while not living here also grew up and also had a kid while not living here? Well...""

Either way, I find the whole argument a little strange. On one hand you emphasize how citizenship is of little importance, Then on the other hand we have people overreacting because citizenship is extremely important/valuable to them.

I couldn't tell if it was genuine concern or not.

*Beyond Good &amp; Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future*, #237

This was first published by Nietzsche himself in 1886. That same year, he wrote a series of new prefaces for his existing body of work (everything up to *Zarathustra*), essentially pulling everything he'd been working on into focus. While Zarathustra was poetic and suggestive, *BGE*, the prefaces, and the projects which followed (all under the banner of ""a revaluation of a values""), were written to get his thoughts across clearly. 

So, the above quote sits at the beginning of a good four pages worth of Nietzsche's take on women. He doesn't *advocate* treating women like property, he *observes* that they've been treated as such.  These passages are a sustained examination of the rubric ""women."" Not brief metaphors, or silly punchlines, but paragraphs examining the positioning of women in Europe at the time. 

""Since the French Revolution,"" he writes ""Woman's influence in Europe has decreased proportionately as her rights and claims have increased. . .""

And so on. ""A horrendous hater of women,"" my ass.

Here's one from his ""middle period,"" from *Daybreak.* It goes:

""*Here we must invent new ideals*--We ought not to be permitted to come to a decision affecting our life when we are in the condition of being in love, not to determine once and for all the character of the company we keep on a violent whim: the oaths of lovers ought to be publicly declared invalid and marriage denied them:--the reason being that one ought to take marriage more seriously!""

Bertrand Russell was either pretending to know Nietzsche way better than he did, or he was too trusting of the second-hand accounts and slipshod translations available to him at the time. (*History* wasn't published until after the war, in 1945. *BG&amp;E* didn't get a decent translation until 1965. Nietzsche's work wasn't properly organized until the mid-70s.) The fact is, there's been a lot accomplished in the field of Nietzsche studies since the end of the second World War.",t3_9fbtu,c0cooj0,,True,,,0,philosophy,False,t5_2qh5b,0,t1_c0cn9dy,1,t1_c0cooj0,[deleted],0

True,1426034882,1251881475,5,"1.  Saying Stalin and Mao committed atrocities in the name of communism rather than atheism is setting a double standard.  What's the biggest religious atrocity you can think of?  Lets take the Crusades for example, then.  When the Muslims took Jerusalem they allowed pilgrims of all Abrahamic religions -- Jew, Christian or Muslim -- to enter and leave the city freely.  Yet Pope Urban declared the Crusades not out of a religious conviction, since at the time most Christians and Muslims really didn't have any conflict with one another (certainly not the Muslims, who still begrudgingly respected the Christians and the Jews as fellow People of the Book), but he did it as a way to politically unify the European kingdoms under the banner of Catholicism.  It was a political move.  The bloody wars between Protestants and Catholics was also political.  Why do you think German princes supported Martin Luther wholeheartedly?  Do you honestly think it was out of a deep sense of spiritual conviction?  Some might have felt that way, but the main reason was because they would no longer need to answer to the authority of the Catholic chuch.  For a culture of people who were divided into hundreds of different Germanic states, the idea of cowtowing to a man in Rome was undesirable to say the least.

Stalin and Mao thought religion kept the masses from progressing.  This could be seen as a political motivation, but where do you draw the line then between what is a personal or political conviction?  If they chose another system besides communism do you think they would have thought any different?  You also make the assumption that atheism is NOT faith in the unprovable.  Oh, that's right, atheists like to use the convenient definition of ""lack of belief in God"" rather than ""believing there is no God.""  I intern as a copywriter so I know PR bullshit when I see it.  If I ""lack an opinion"" on something it's synonymous with saying ""I don't give a shit.""  It's just a nicer way of phrasing it.  I could easily turn this around as a deist and claim I ""lack belief in a non-existent creator"" rather than ""believe in God.""

2.  That's probably because you misunderstood the argument.  Way to jump the gun.  He could just as easily have been channeling Voltaire, who said, ""If God did not exist, it would be necessary to create Him.""  Human beings like to see patterns in things.  It's just the way we're programmed.  We observe, order and ordain.  Also, people are far more complicated than you paint them out to be.  I'm not saying that it's absolutely out of the question that ""wealth and health"" evangelists are in it just for the money, but I'm saying that it's short-sighted, arrogant and just plain stupid to assume that's the case.  In grade school you might've learned that King Henry broke off from the Catholic Church simply because the Pope wouldn't grant him a divorce.

His actual reasons were more nuanced.  He was a man that truly struggled with his faith, and was torn between the need to produce an heir for his kingdom or to listen to the Vicar of God.  He also recognized the political reasons.  The Catholic Church has done plenty of annulments and divorces in the past, and conveniently ignored the Bible.  The reason why they didn't grant Henry a divorce was because his wife Catherine was the daughter of King Ferdinand of Aragorn, who had the current Pope by the balls.

True,1426034882,1251881574,2,"&gt; Well, if you want to debate a world without citizenships altogether and open borders that's another discussion. One I might even support, but I think it would still change the way things work more than you illustrate.

Open borders don't change much, we've already seen that in the areas where they already exist. True, a world without citizenship altogether is quite different and not necessarily desirable because a having many different government and financial systems allows for a greater level of variation (and thus innovation) and also creates resilience in the face of crisis (the current financial crisis wasn't even noticed in India's banking system, and Canada's rode it out quite well; that would not have been possible without the autonomous decision-making allowed for by the existence of different systems in the first place).

&gt; It kind of defeats the purpose, go back far enough in my family tree and I assume I could be a citizen anywhere in Europe.

But this is not what I've been arguing for, and thanks for the opportunity to bring that out. By descent, I am Swedish, Finnish, German, Irish, Scottish and Venezuelan. I don't think I should be able to claim those citizenships because they have not been 'maintained'. If you don't renew your relationship with the country, even in just a bureaucratic sense, then you don't really have a claim. Any benefit that comes from citizens abroad comes from them maintaining their ties with the 'home' country.

&gt; As for the exploits, I figure those were pretty obvious. We have socialized healthcare, cheap schools and the like. Your idea makes concepts like immigration non-existant as people can just come and go as they please.

Ahh, but here's the rub. Where health-care is concerned, it's not citizenship alone that confers access to Canada's healthcare system, the primary criterion is residency (since landed immigrants have access). I am a Canadian citizen (born and lived most of my life there), but, living outside of Canada, I need to buy health insurance when I travel to Canada because I am not resident. This is not the case for education, but it was probably deemed advantageous back when the transfer system was set up not to require residency to tap into post-secondary education, and it would not be difficult to require residency to apply to a Canadian university in the face of changing conditions (it's a simple amendment to existing legislation). In fact, all these possible scams that people bring up are stopped cold by requiring residency. When people do come to use these services, they also end up paying into the tax system anyways because using them requires effectively setting up residency and that always entails taxes, even if it is just sales taxes (which you can refuse to reimburse for stays longer than X days). ""Just visiting"" is extremely expensive tax wise, and if they become resident, you start collecting the normal range of taxes on them that you do on Canadians ""pure-laine"".

&gt; What does it say about the US's already staggeringly high unemployment rate if I could just move there tomorrow and apply for a job, bypassing all the red tape.

Require residency for UI, end of problem. As for competition for jobs, then it provides a good incentive to the government to make sure that the education system produces a superior product (it is interesting that the government that is so interested in binding Canadians to Canada is also so disinterested in maintaining the quality of education in the country). I'm not saying that this solves all the problems that presents, but I don't see that ""removing"" the citizenship of Canadians' grandchildren, or requiring their mothers to fly to Canada for a few days, is the **only** way to address the problem

&gt; What does it say about trade if I can claim citizenship and bring X amount of dollars of stuff across borders without fee's or tariffs, claiming I'm just moving back and forth between my two homes?

Yes, but the whole movement in the world is towards dropping this crap anyways. Why take a step backward to maintain a notion of citizenship that was valid and useful in a world that doesn't exist anymore?

&gt; ""Oh you were living out of the country a bit and had a kid there? No problem! They can still be a citizen"". ""Oh, your kid who you had while not living here also grew up and also had a kid while not living here? Well...

&gt; Either way, I find the whole argument a little strange.""

How is requiring people to hop on a plane, as long as they do it before they are 7 months pregnant, not strange? In fact, it is similar to, and not as exacting as, a system as requiring residency to benefit from the public purse. Conferring citizenship on birth means that you only need to have been in the country once in your life in such an inconsequential manner, it's ridiculous. Why not make the citizenship game such that people are **encouraged** to come back to the country rather than use the threat of the ""exile"" of their descendants to keep them locked inside the house? The Conservatives seem to be fond of using these fear-based means for doing everything they do, from appealing to people in elections, to governing. In this case, it makes Canada move backward rather than forward.

What is weird about all this is that the concept of citizenship that the Canadian government is putting forward only limits Canadians, rather than making sure that people who wish to become Canadians are doing so for the right reasons and will actually bring something of value to the country. 

I would think that the immediate problems of citizenship and immigration would be better addressed by correcting the way we deal with people who have no connection to the country at all, rather than making life difficult for people who are already Canadian (I am thinking of Canadians going abroad who are concerned about the legal status of their descendants). I take it to be the small-minded mentality of the Conservatives who wish to punish these people for ""betraying"" them, it is quite a bit like the emotional state of a spurned lover. 

Like I said, a more rational system would seek to use the experience and position of Canadians living abroad to Canada's advantage and seek to entice them into coming home (since they are the most preferred ""immigrants"" because they already have a connection to the country), rather than requiring them to ""game"" a more restrictive and vindictive system by having pregnant ladies timing their flights back to Canada properly.

&gt;  On one hand you emphasize how citizenship is of little importance, Then on the other hand we have people overreacting because citizenship is extremely important/valuable to them.

What I am saying is that the model of citizenship being put forward by the Conservatives is a model that worked in a world that no longer exists. When people and goods move around the world more freely than before, Canada should shape its model of citizenship in such a way that it takes advantage of the movement of people and goods, rather than deny itself that advantage and try to ""punish"" people who want to live in the world as it is, rather than as it was.

The first steps towards realizing this new model would be tying government benefits to residency  or residency + citizenship. This would remove most objections to passing citizenship through active maintenance of citizenship in lines of descent outside of the country. Another piece of the puzzle is to more actively solicit energy of Canadians living outside the country to advance Canada's goals. There's another piece. That would be the foundation of a model of citizenship that works in the 21st century rather than in the 19th century.

BTW I up-voted you. For some strange reason, someone down-voted you; probably because you tried to engage in rational discussion of the issue rather than saying ""STFU! Canada #1! Live here or fuck you!""

Now, for my cereal (which around here - Europe - we call Muesli) I prepare my own milk, which is a blend of almonds and hazelnuts. It's really easy - takes about 10 minutes to prepare - and it is always fresh that way. Just put a handful of raw almonds, a handful of raw hazelnuts and vanilla to taste in a blender. Pour in about 0.5L ( ~17 fl. oz.) and blend for 30-60 seconds. Then use a strainer to remove the pulp. In fact, I use two different strainers consecutively - the first has a looser net and larger capacity, the second is tighter, to remove even the smallest particles of pulp. Tastes really nice.

I spent about 3 months in the states earlier this year, visiting with my parents, and while there I found an even better alternative - hemp milk! It's not cheap, probably because hemp cultivation is illegal in the US so it is imported. But I really like the taste and consistency. Also, it's claimed to be probably the healthiest milk substitute, containing most if not all essential amino acids and a good omega-3 to omega-6 balance. Just make sure you try a few different manufacturers before you give it your final verdict. Some of the hemp milks I've tried had a somewhat harsh note.

Requiring some sort of physical authentication, like a dongle, is a step in the right direction.

In the [UBS](http://www.ubs.ch) system, you provide your account number, then the system presents you with a nonce, which you type into a small pocket calculator (which itself needs to be activated with a PIN code). The string of characters your calculator provides must then be typed into the fields on the website, which in turn allows you access to your account.

Using a password-guessing attack breaks the BoA system with ease, while Chinese (and European) banks remain protected due to the second layer of security.

I'm willing to concede that my emergency room example is flawed. It's entirely possible that a visit to the emergency room may improve quality of life just as inexpensively as routine visits to a primary care provider. On the surface it seems like it wouldn't but maybe that's just my biased thinking. Either way the uninsured patient will still have to be covered by taxpayers.

Allow me to change the topic a bit and ask you another question. Do you feel that healthcare in the US is accurately priced? It seems we hear a lot about how healthcare dollars in America don't go as far as they used to go. We also hear that per capita the EU spends several thousand dollars less each year on its citizens for health care. We are then told that the EU lifespan and quality of life is better than in the US. What this implies (though doesn't prove) is that we aren't getting our money's worth in the US when it comes to healthcare. 

If you buy this argument and you could figure out a way to lower healthcare costs then it would seem to affect the studies that you cited. In some cases the treatments might be less expensive. In other cases they wouldn't be done. I guess what I'm wondering is if you try to wring the extra expenses out of the US healthcare system then at some point it would seem that preventative care may become much more cost effective. This of course would be mitigated by the fact that you may not provide the treatments where the expense/QALY ratio is 1 or less.

I can't remember my original comment word for word but it went something like:

&gt;If taxation is theft, then property is theft, so its all a wash.

And, truly, I do think the ""taxation is theft"" line is about as silly and pointless as the ""all property is theft"" line.  Moreso, really, as the ""all property is theft"" line has some actual thinking behind it and does make a (twisty and not really useful) sort of sense.

&gt;Somalia seems like a hell hole, and I don't think using it as an example of libertarian utopia is apt.

In general, I agree, which is why I didn't make that claim.  I do think that, in the long run, any attempt at a Libertarian ""state"" would fail and fail in a manner very similar to Somalia.  But that doesn't make the ""Libertarianism == Somalia"" argument really valid.  Its a dismissive cheapshot, and like I said, I'm trying (with varying degrees of success) to avoid those.

&gt;Correlation without causation. Unless you can show a causal relationship?

Nope.  But I can show that *every* state with an essentially non-existent tax structure is a hellhole.  Which doesn't prove causation, but does strongly imply it.

Governments provide necessary services, not the least of which are military and international law enforcement of borders, territorial waters, etc.  One of the many problems facing Somalia today is that since it isn't really a state anymore, since it doesn't really have a government anymore (much less a military) it can't enforce either, and many European corporations have taken to dumping toxic waste into Somali waters.

You can't do that without taxation.

Roads, schools, etc all require taxes.  And no, I don't think the Libertarian fantasy of private parties doing that instead of the government would work.  I think Libertarianism/Randism is essentially a utopian position, that is it requires people to act in a non-human manner.  People are lazy, they're not rational economic actors, and they're often shockingly short sighted.  Investing in infrastructure, education, etc (especially if it costs a lot, and it will) is not something most people will do voluntarily.

Some will, yes.  I, for example, am paying an outrageous sum every month to put my child (now 3) in the best, most accelerated, richest educational environment available in my area.  This is costing me roughly 11% of my income (after taxes), and the only return I'll see on that investment is that my child will be better educated than many of his peers.

The problem is that a modern society requires a certain degree of education for all (or at least the vast majority) of its population or it won't work.  And I doubt both the willingness and ability of many people to make the economic sacrifice necessary to provide that education for their children.

&gt;I can go live with my brother and not pay rent.

And you can not have any income and not pay taxes, lots of homeless people do this.  Its an unattractive choice, but so is living with family.

&gt;Not so much with governments: some states forbid citizens from leaving

Yours does not, so that argument is irrelevant to the discussion at hand.

&gt;and with those that do allow citizens to leave, there isn't any land of the free left on the planet.

Sure there is, its just all very unattractive.  While I agree that Somalia is not a Libertarian paradise, its there, you could move there, its unattractive but you can't claim it doesn't exist.  Similarly, there is Antarctica, various ice shelves (though that's a chancy proposition given the melt rate), and probably at least a few tiny islands that can be purchased for insanely high dollar values.

There's also Sealand, and a few other similar places.

But, I also think this illustrates my point.  Your philosophy is unworkable, if it were you'd have a Libertarian paradise to move to.  Yet out of all the political philosophies that have succeeded well enough to have functioning (or even semi-functioning) nations subscribing, Libertarianism/Randism stands almost alone in not having any nation.

I argue that this is largely because its an unworkable philosophy.

Since, contrary to the claims of many Libertarin/Randites, America is not a dictatorship, you are perfectly free to try and convince your fellow Americans that your position is correct, that taxation really is theft, and win elections.  You don't seem to have had any success in that area, and I argue that this is because most people look at your philosophy and realize that its inherently unworkable.

My point remains: if you are so philosophically opposed to paying taxes you can leave.  You can try to convince enough voters to go along with your philosophy to change US policy.

If there's no where you want to go that's hardly my fault, or the fault of the US government.  I fail to see how anyone is under an obligation to provide you with a Libertarian paradise in which to live.  If you can't get enough people to create one, I'd say that's pretty good evidence that your philosophy isn't really all that workable.

EDIT: I should add, though its probably obvious from my comments, that I am opposed to trying to turn America into your Libertarian paradise, and will actively work against that goal.

True,1426035039,1251905932,76,"I'm an American living in Holland, and find the free speech / hate speech principles fascinating because the starting points are quite different.  Just for everyone else, I'll share what I've learned (sorry for the length)

Simplified, the American constitutional perspective is one of born oppression by a government and revolution;  the Dutch out of various different religious groups wanting to protect themselves from interference from other religious groups (at the time all Christian groups, with non-Christian / non-native groups enjoying some benefits from the system).  The Dutch system was made to hold a country, which was essentially fractured, together.

The Dutch system is much, much more orientated towards groups in addition to the individual, whereas the American system is focused more towards individual rights.  This, combined with the general European trend to enact laws with the intent to prevent another Holocaust, makes the Dutch system much more sensitive to group discrimination.

A good example of this is school systems with regard to religious groups.  In the US system, giving money to a private school is seen as unconstitutional, since it would be interfering with church/state separation.  As such, if the US government wants to school children, it needs to create a public school system with no religious teachings and make it available to everyone.  The Dutch constitution, on the other hand, would see this as an unfairly discriminating a group (say Mulims, Christians, or a non-religious group which prefers a different education style) who want their children to be schooled in their own institutions.  We (Americans) think secularism is the absence of religious position, whereas the Dutch constitution sees secularism as an ideology as well, and if the state will promote that ideology it must also fund the schools of groups of people with different ideologies (again: religious, or just Montessori).

So the Dutch constitution is very serious when it comes to provoking injustice/intolerance against groups, be they Christian/Muslim/whatever.  Geert Wilders walks this line by insulting ""Mohammad"" but not a whole group.

What I don't like about the protest method mentioned in the article (and that's essentially what it is) is that the author has a really crappy position.  This is what he says:

&gt;The charges against the AEL ""illustrates what Muslims have been saying for decades,"" Bouzerda said in a response published on the league's Web site. ""Freedom of expression is only a pretext to make life bitter for Muslims ... and if (they) try to bring this hypocrisy to light, that right is denied them."" 

Actually, that's not the major argument Muslims in Holland (and internationally) have been saying in response to benign Danish cartoons or provocative assholes like Geert Wilders / Hirsi Ali / Theo van Gogh.  What they've been saying is ""Stop Insulting Islam!"".

So now this provocateur comes along, pulls a stunt which clearly crosses the lines which Geert Wilders (douche-baggingly) danced on with his film, and says:

&gt;Bouzerda said anyone should be allowed to publish insulting material in the interest of public debate. 

This is a very American perspective, which is easy for most redditors (including myself) to agree with, but the reality is that if that were permitted in Holland it would not result in a lot of Muslims going ""whew, thank Allah there's no more double-standard!"".  No...  the general response (in Holland and worldwide) to provocative anti-Muslim comments has been for the government to ""do something about it"", not to let them speak their mind.

That's why I think he's hypocritical.",t3_9gk8y,c0cozdu,,True,,,0,worldnews,False,t5_2qh13,0,t3_9gk8y,76,t1_c0cozdu,furyg3,0

Pick up Risk as your first board game. Most geeks know how to play, and its a very fun game. You can find it at any store that sells board games, and its easy to learn the rules. There is a lot of luck involved, but overall it is a blast to play.  What I did personally was find two friends to play RISK with, then we slowly added a few more into our ""Board-game group"" (It helps if you already have something similar to a D&amp;D group). You might consider splitting costs for new board games if a student.

Where you move from RISK is entirely up to you. I went with more European/German style board games such as my favorite [Puerto Rico](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3076) and Settlers of Catan. I find European board games to have a lot more depth of strategy and a lot higher quality of a game than your traditional American board games (Monopoly,Risk,Clue).

I **highly** recommend checking out Puerto Rico. Every *intellgent* person I have taught this game to has absolutely loved it. It is 95% strategy with almost no luck involved. You are a spaniard who owns a piece of Puerto Rico and must trade goods such as cofee, indigo,corn for money which you use to build things to expand your control over the economy. Every round everyone chooses a role such as ""Captain"" which lets you ship goods to Spain for ""Victory points"", the catch is that everyone can ship goods as well. You have to balance what you want to do, and what you don't want your opponent to do. Like I said before it is purely strategy based, having to balance your economy with production while worrying about your opponents.

True,1426035079,1251907109,1,"Why do manufacturers exceed standards, and who does crash testing?  I don't see it as a bad example at all.  Consumers place value in safety and some are willing to pay more for safety features.  The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety does the testing, paid for by insurance companies.  

Similarly, your home was most likely constructed to a building code which was determined not by a government agency, but an independent organization.  Your local government may mandate that the construction adhere to that standard, but insurance companies do as well and would demand such in the absence of government mandates.  

&gt;It's not easy for the layman to determine who is the best doctor just via research. People's bodies are far more complex than cars, let alone extension cords. The costs of choosing the wrong one are also far, far higher.

The complexity doesn't change the issue at all... two people should be free to enter a contract without the overreaching hand of government being involved.  Plus there's already quite a range in the care you will receive based upon which doctor or hospital you choose to visit today... the mortality rates or procedure success rates vary wildly.  

My wife had a seizure for the first time last week and we need to get her to a neurologist this week.  Instead of relying on government licenses to define our selection, we chose a board certified neurologist who is rated among the ten best in our metro area by his peers, as well as having positive patient reviews.  Success is not guaranteed, but its chances are greatly improved by selecting the right person for the job.  With this case, money is not the issue... we'd be willing to pay more for the right person.  However, if I had a sinus infection I would prefer to go to the pharmacy and have the pharmacist give me Zithromax rather than me clog up the system by having an exam of a yearly recurring problem.  That choice *should* be mine.

&gt;they have a tendency to become cartels, or protection rackets, and to end up fraudulent.

Historical reference would be helpful.  The UL and IIHS have done a good job, not without flaw or incident, but the FDA surely isn't without flaw or incident either.  The problem with public sector monopolies is that it infringes upon my freedom to contract, one that has shown historically to have a high cost such as death.  The FDA being the only certification for drugs have limited the market such that hundreds of thousands have died needlessly while patients in Europe or Japan had been treated.  

&gt;Likewise if nobody provides this service (given the brutality of a market like this, it's possible), without government intervention, the market for doctors becomes market for lemons. Suddenly you won't be able to tell the good from the bad AT ALL.

Israel is the regional power. It is the big mean dog, it has all that it wants, the land, military dominance over all its neighbours, trade, the coverage of the worlds only super power. Therefore Israel wants to maintain the current status quo as is. Israel wants to impose its will calling it peace on a defeated people. Those who rule always want that kind of peace.

I dont expect everyone to agree with the Palestinian POV but at least to understand it.

Palestinians do not place the same premium on peace the Israelis do. They have very little. They have issues that need addressing, the right of return, the occupation of the West Bank, the annexation of Jerusalem, the economic shut down, the total control and blockade of their areas. They see peace as surrender. This is why they keep firing rockets. They want justice. The ruled always do.

To get Peace the Israelis have to address issues they do not want to. Until Israel is prepared to do that, there will not be peace.

It can be done, The UK showed the way when it talked to the IRA with no pre-condtions. No, ""edit the United Ireland part of your charter"" before we talk. The commander of the Londonderry IRA is now a UK member of parliament and Northern Ireland is still a part of the UK. By talking to the extremists, you fractionalise them, those that want peace, and those that want to fight. To strengthen the hand of those that want peace serious concessions have to be made, when those that want to derail the peace talks strike with rocket attacks and car bombs you have to be very careful with retaliation. Its a long slow road, but there was a time when Northern Ireland looked as hopeless as Palestine, but look at it now.

The PLO was willing to change its charter and recognize Israel, didn't get them anywhere...

The solution to the problems obvious. All the peace plans are essentially the same. Clinton's Peace Plan, the Nusseiba-Ayalon Plan, the Saudi Peace Initiative, Bush’s Road Map, Oslo, Taba summit are all similar

They all include clear measures that Israel has to take in order to make peace:

1.Dismantle the settlements.  
2.Withdraw its soldiers and civilians from the occupied territories,  
3.Allow the creation a viable Palestinian state.      
4.find a solution for the Palestinian refugees' right of return.   
5.Find a way to guarantee Israeli security. Altho' I believe having nuke addresses that.  
6.A creative way to reward Israel for giving up what it feels it has won in war.

The problem is Israel will not to go along with these plans. At some point, there will be an event and the talks will fail. developing new plans is a waste of time. Israel wants land, specifically the West Bank. Israel has not dismantled a single settlement built there, and has never ceased to take Palestinian lands under the guise of security. This is the underlying tactic. The aim is to create a ""reality on the ground"" where it become impossible to uproot 100,000's of settlers. The Palestinians will become a servant population within this greater Israel ruled by a compliant Palestinian authority.  

My greatest insight occurred while living in Israel.
I came to realize Israel is a typical colonialist project.
Europeans jews using American Jewish wealth, politics and violence to transfer a native population from their land using using a tried and true tactic.
You start friendly, grow in strength, then remove more natives, when they see what is happening and they resist play the ""we are the victims of native violence"" card and use greater violence to remove greater numbers. Continue until you got all you want.

Despite all the politically correct prattle we've heard the last decade, Islam in practice today (essentially ever since they got kicked out of Andalusia) is NOT a ""Religion Of Peace.""  It is a vicious system the relies on oppression and fear to keep the faithful enraged and hateful.  It is not first a religious system, it is a socio-political system bent an acquiring full and total power.  It is thus far, far, far worse than the excesses of Judaism or Christianity in history.  For instance, the 9/11 murderers killed about as many people in one morning as the Catholic Church did in the *entire* Spanish Inquisition.  (The only thing that has kept Islam at bay the last 300 years is the internal fighting among all those possessing ""true Islam"".  Exploiting the Shia-Sunni divide may be the best tactic the West can use.)

There are, no doubt, plenty of Muslims that yearn to be free of all this, but they have little or no political power (or they moved to Detroit already).   If Europe gives up its essential Western character to become a place dominated by people that want a theocracy via caliphate, you folks are screwed ... and there is abundant evidence to indicate that is EXACTLY what is be taught in the mosques already.

Yup and yup and you're arguing a straw man. 

My point is simply this: People living in Canada, be they citizens, landed, or refugees should be the focus of our government and its people. 

People choosing to peruse life outside of Canada - citizens or not, should, after a period of time, have some of their ties to this country lessened. (And really with this law we're talking generations here)

I see no issue with that. A Canadian citizen will never lose citizenship, however an extended absence can result in the ability to pass that privilege on. This is logical in my mind, and respectful of the responsibilities of such a citizenship. I'm also Italian(euro) and have UK citizenship. I can pass neither on to my children without living in Europe for a time. I see nothing wrong with that. Extending the benefits and responsibilities to my children is irresponsible if those children know nothing about the culture or country they are supposedly citizens of. 

&gt;The best solution is just to let those who already have a connection to the country maintain and pass on that connection to their descendants as long as they wish to maintain that connection. It only has upside for the country and very little cost over the long term.

Discounting the fact that it dilutes the meaning of said citizenship in the ways that we're discussing right here: The post's insistence that a person that has never entered the country and won't in the foreseeable future should somehow be a citizen while a skilled person that *actually wants to make a living here in Canada* can't without jumping through innumerable hoops.

I'd suggest replacing it with the EF-S 17-85mm f/4-5.6 IS USM or EF 28-105mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM ; at least the 17-85 is a really super duper cool general purpose lens that I've owned for several years now; both of those are good enough to fit onto better cameras when/if you buy one.

I am assuming that in Europe you'll mostly be somewhat close to things so you won't need something like a 200, f/3.5 or f/4 is good enough for most light situations (the 50mm 1.8 is an amazing lens, the 50mm 1.4 more so, but much more of a portrait lens).

I have owned my 17-85 and 350D combo since around 2003 or so, and dragged it all over South America, Southeast Asia, Europe and the US; I'm going on about 30k photos with it and it was a great learning experience.  

_Edit:_ B&amp;H gave me a discount on the lens when I bought it with the body instead of the kit lens.  Ask them.  They also have bundles with those lenses; a bit more expensive (~$1k-$1.1k) but IMHO worth it if you can afford it.

1. You assume that people who don't know anything about the country and don't care about it will want to maintain citizenship (my father didn't maintain his claims to citizenship in Finland). I would argue that if someone is interested enough in the country to want to maintain citizenship, it is worth it for the country to do so. Your arguments about that responsibilities, etc, make more sense in the perspective of a world where travel was rarer and trade was far more restricted. You limit the options of descendants Canadians who would want to work for multinationals or study abroad  (like the father-in-law of the OP) or those who would serve Canada directly in overseas roles. It is simply not in the country's interest to give someone who might advance Canada's lot a reason to limit their horizons, especially now that borders are more ""porous"" to the movement of people and goods than they ever were (and this is only going to increase as long as the world economy is a world economy, if it somehow retreats from being a world economy, we'll have much larger problems than who gets to be a citizen or not).

2.

&gt; The post's insistence that a person that has never entered the country and won't in the foreseeable future should somehow be a citizen while a skilled person that actually wants to make a living here in Canada can't without jumping through innumerable hoops.

What exactly is lost to anyone if that person doesn't want to come back then? The skilled labourer gets their job and eventually becomes a citizen, and the overseas Canadian continues to pay consular fees. The value of citizenship is maximized if it is both hard to attain and hard to lose. If the overseas Canadian chooses to come back to contribute directly to the Canadian economy, why should the claim of a non-citizen to be a citizen be more important than the status of what was a citizen before the legislation change and who has a greater connection to Canadian society through heritage and culture (I don't know why you assume that Canadians overseas become detached from Canadian culture... most ""Canadians"" complain about how new canadians are too attached to their home countries, as well as their children).

In the end, I am arguing for a notion of citizenship that recognizes basically that people are becoming less and less formal citizens of this or those countries and more and more informal citizens of the world. The formal legal system around citizenship needs to change to reflect that reality a little more... we don't live in the 19th century anymore. 

What is sad is that this would be less of a debate if we were talking about people moving back and forth between North America, Europe and a few Asian countries, since there would be less economic migration on the part of unskilled or low-skilled workers. It's the possibility of people from countries in the 3rd world playing a best of both worlds game that screws things up. One can only hope that we find some way of equalizing the estate of all countries so that this is less of a threat and we can all move forward together.

I suppose the difference in our views is that where you prefer a more inward looking government, I prefer a government that looks outward and seeks more integration with what is going on outside its borders (and I think this is necessary especially because most of the institutional entities that operate within Canadian borders are multi-national actors. If Canada wants to be able to control these entities, it needs to increase its ability to exercise soft power in the other areas of the world where these entities operate.

True,1426035327,1251923069,3,"I think, first, we need to have a common definition of the term ""socialism"" - from an economics standpoint, it commonly refers to a system in which the government owns the means of production within an economy. The BEST experiment with socialism that was ever conducted was in Britian in the 1950s/early60s- after WWII, it was completely necessary to rebuild the shattered country. 

Unfortunately, socialism- again, going by the purely economic definition, was a failure. The economy of Britain stagnated compared with the rest of the developed world as its government-controlled corporations couldn't compete with capitalist entites, both in Europe and around the world. As a result, Britain largely abandoned its socialist experiment- with several (NHS) important exceptions. 

So...my problem with socialism is that it is an inefficient means of resource allocation. (How's THAT for an example of why economics is called  the ""dismal science"" - no room for bleeding hearts in its tenants, that's for sure.) Now, I understand that there are such things as purely ""public goods"" for which government ownership of production is essential. Think national defense, police, utilities (a public good in my opinion, though this has been debated), fire protection (fire tends not to care if one house has private fire protection, one doesn't, and so on), etc...

On Sept. 1, 1939, 70 years ago, the German Army crossed the Polish frontier. On Sept. 3, Britain declared war.

Six years later, 50 million Christians and Jews had perished. Britain was broken and bankrupt, Germany a smoldering ruin. Europe had served as the site of the most murderous combat known to man, and civilians had suffered worse horrors than the soldiers.

By May 1945, Red Army hordes occupied all the great capitals of Central Europe: Vienna, Prague, Budapest, Berlin. A hundred million Christians were under the heel of the most barbarous tyranny in history: the Bolshevik regime of the greatest terrorist of them all, Joseph Stalin.

What cause could justify such sacrifices?

The German-Polish war had come out of a quarrel over a town the size of Ocean City, Md., in summer. Danzig, 95 percent German, had been severed from Germany at Versailles in violation of Woodrow Wilson’s principle of self-determination. Even British leaders thought Danzig should be returned.

Why did Warsaw not negotiate with Berlin, which was hinting at an offer of compensatory territory in Slovakia? Because the Poles had a war guarantee from Britain that, should Germany attack, Britain and her empire would come to Poland’s rescue.

But why would Britain hand an unsolicited war guarantee to a junta of Polish colonels, giving them the power to drag Britain into a second war with the most powerful nation in Europe?

Was Danzig worth a war? Unlike the 7 million Hong Kongese whom the British surrendered to Beijing, who didn’t want to go, the Danzigers were clamoring to return to Germany.

Comes the response: The war guarantee was not about Danzig, or even about Poland. It was about the moral and strategic imperative “to stop Hitler” after he showed, by tearing up the Munich pact and Czechoslovakia with it, that he was out to conquer the world. And this Nazi beast could not be allowed to do that.

If true, a fair point. Americans, after all, were prepared to use atom bombs to keep the Red Army from the Channel. But where is the evidence that Adolf Hitler, whose victims as of March 1939 were a fraction of Gen. Pinochet’s, or Fidel Castro’s, was out to conquer the world?

After Munich in 1938, Czechoslovakia did indeed crumble and come apart. Yet consider what became of its parts.

The Sudeten Germans were returned to German rule, as they wished. Poland had annexed the tiny disputed region of Teschen, where thousands of Poles lived. Hungary’s ancestral lands in the south of Slovakia had been returned to her. The Slovaks had their full independence guaranteed by Germany. As for the Czechs, they came to Berlin for the same deal as the Slovaks, but Hitler insisted they accept a protectorate.

Now one may despise what was done, but how did this partition of Czechoslovakia manifest a Hitlerian drive for world conquest?

Comes the reply: If Britain had not given the war guarantee and gone to war, after Czechoslovakia would have come Poland’s turn, then Russia’s, then France’s, then Britain’s, then the United States.

We would all be speaking German now.

But if Hitler was out to conquer the world — Britain, Africa, the Middle East, the United States, Canada, South America, India, Asia, Australia — why did he spend three years building that hugely expensive Siegfried Line to protect Germany from France? Why did he start the war with no surface fleet, no troop transports and only 29 oceangoing submarines? How do you conquer the world with a navy that can’t get out of the Baltic Sea?

If Hitler wanted the world, why did he not build strategic bombers, instead of two-engine Dorniers and Heinkels that could not even reach Britain from Germany?

Why did he let the British army go at Dunkirk?

Why did he offer the British peace, twice, after Poland fell, and again after France fell?

Why, when Paris fell, did Hitler not demand the French fleet, as the Allies demanded and got the Kaiser’s fleet? Why did he not demand bases in French-controlled Syria to attack Suez? Why did he beg Benito Mussolini not to attack Greece?

Because Hitler wanted to end the war in 1940, almost two years before the trains began to roll to the camps.

Hitler had never wanted war with Poland, but an alliance with Poland such as he had with Francisco Franco’s Spain, Mussolini’s Italy, Miklos Horthy’s Hungary and Father Jozef Tiso’s Slovakia.

Indeed, why would he want war when, by 1939, he was surrounded by allied, friendly or neutral neighbors, save France. And he had written off Alsace, because reconquering Alsace meant war with France, and that meant war with Britain, whose empire he admired and whom he had always sought as an ally.

As of March 1939, Hitler did not even have a border with Russia. How then could he invade Russia?

In the same way we don't have a pure democracy, and instead blended aspects of democracy, oligarchy, and monarchy into a single government.

""First, it's shaky ground to compare U.S. infant mortality with reports from other countries. The United States counts all births as live if they show any sign of life, regardless of prematurity or size. This includes what many other countries report as stillbirths. In Austria and Germany, fetal weight must be at least 500 grams (1 pound) to count as a live birth; in other parts of Europe, such as Switzerland, the fetus must be at least 30 centimeters (12 inches) long. In Belgium and France, births at less than 26 weeks of pregnancy are registered as lifeless.[5] And some countries don't reliably register babies who die within the first 24 hours of birth. Thus, the United States is sure to report higher infant mortality rates. For this very reason, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which collects the European numbers, warns of head-to-head comparisons by country.""

True,1426035353,1251925067,28,"There is a difference between socialism and welfare. 

Socialist states are where the government controls the means of production. The government owns the banks, owns the media, owns the car companies, owns the mines, the farms everything. The fruits of labor are distributed in a egalitarian fashion. 

Welfare states are states where government takes responsibility for assuring their citizens of a minimum standard of quality of life. 
 
Sweden for example is often refered to as a socialist country, when it is in fact just an extreme welfare state. The economic engine of Sweden are private companies. They are then heavily taxed, and the government then supports those who don't support themselves. 

It is actually one of the less socialized countries in Europe, though mostly because during WWII it was neutral, as the rest of Europe destroyed its industry. 

America totally rejects socialism while embracing welfare at a moderate level. We buy what we need from private companies instead of having a government operation build it. 

We don't socialize food, we give food stamps. We don't build bombers, McDonald-Douglas does. We don't build power plants, we set up corporations and co-ops to do it. Sure regulation is necessary, but we always use the market to do the lifting, even if the government is doing the buying. 

I think we should expand our welfare state to include health care, but we absolutely should net have government run the health care industry. This is how the French, and the Sweds run their system. Companies operate hospitals and even insurance companies but the government pays for it. 

But we shouldn't become a socialist nation. Its not a good way of creating wealth, and even educated Europeans will say so. Look at Europe, they've been privatizing their national industries since the 1970's.

&gt;The Congress shall have the Power To … raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years....

The idea behind this was to allow for national crisis to be dealt with, but still place limits on the appropriation of funds for waging war.

In it's historical context, it is quite obvious that the Framers were terrified of a standing army becoming a permanent fixture in United States governmental structure. They tried to put systems in place to make it particularly difficult to go to war (separation of powers, sunsetting of budgetary allocations), for the express purpose of avoiding what we have today. During the Constitution Convention in Philadelphia Madison is quoted as saying:

&gt;A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive, will not long be safe companions to liberty. The means of defence against foreign danger, have been always the instruments of tyranny at home. Among the Romans it was a standing maxim to excite a war, whenever a revolt was apprehended. Throughout all Europe, the armies kept up under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the people.

A national defense force, however, is provided for in the Constitution, referred to as the ""militia,"" in Amendment II:

&gt;**A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,** the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed

It's a national country, for Estonian people who there are only 1,4 million left on the planet, who have lived on these lands from the last ice age, who's language group is one of the oldest and uniquest in Europe.

e-Invoicing is an essential part of an efficient financial supply chain and it links the internal processes of enterprises to the payment systems. According to estimations of the European Commission, European e-invoicing initiative can bring savings of around EUR 64.5 billion per year for businesses.

Since 1 January 2004 there has been a legal obligation for undertakings operating in the European Union to accept electronic invoices. However, experience shows that not all companies make the use of this possibility.(...)

The Inquisition was really more of a sub-movement of the Reconquista, which was done to expel Islamic holdings and influence from Spain once and for all.

3.  Historically Jews have worked in professions like law, medicine and banking because they don't require you to be landed like a farmer or a blacksmith.  This is advantageous for a nomadic people for obvious reasons, but they also make a good deal of money, which helps when they need to bribe the shit out of people to leave a country that is gearing up to slaughter them.

(Although a few states in the US do still have _criminal_ libel, which works entirely differently to civil libel; the truth may not be a defence. Someone was charged under this recently.)

Part of the BBC's charter is that it is supposed to be neutral. Compare the now defunct 'equal time' regulations in the US, which applied to everyone, not just the state broadcaster.

But yes, you're right to an extent. Legally, speech is in some ways more constrained in the UK. Interestingly, for whatever reason, the UK has a far freer press than the US in practice; almost all of the mainstream media in the US basically ignored domestic Iraq war protests, for instance, even though they were not required to.

My take on this is that it is because there is no major non-advertising-dependent press in the US; in the UK, the BBC tends to be very honest about things, and this acts as a regulator on the others; they won't seem credible if they ignore stories that the BBC covers, though they can happily cover them from a different angle. In the US, it must be very much easier for a news source to bow to advertiser pressure (as happened in that bizarre whistleblowing case involving Fox News lying about HGH in Florida).

The US also appears to have means of putting semi-official pressure on speech; a vast majority of US scientists believe that the Bush administration suppressed scientific studies from government organisations which called its policies into question, especially in the areas of climate change and bioethics.

True,1426035514,1251937912,1,"&gt;Most Iraqis were killed in sectarian religious violence, not by the US.

&gt;Sadam killed millions of his people fighting Iran for Supremacy in the region. Sadam's iron fist kept sectarian violence from occurring during his rule.

If one is going to play a game -- and I myself have been known to make this point from time to time -- like this, then it is important to get the facts correct.

If one is going to claim that the United States military did not kill the vast majority of the 1 million+ dead in Iraq since the US-lead invasion of Iraq, then:

* Saddam did not kill millions of his own people fighting Iran.  
* The Iranian military killed those millions of the Iraqi people in that war.  
* Saddam, if we are going to be consistent, killed millions of Iranians in that war. 

Now, that isn't to say Saddam didn't kill Iraqi's from time to time.  But he never really did it in anything as fair as fight them in a war.   He was much more the kind of guy to shoot people in the a barrel -- as anyone confined to a barrel can't really shoot back.  

So, yes.... Iraqis are killed mainly in the sectarian violence.  But one can't bring a massive civil war to another country and then claim to have brought them Democracy either.   

Even if one takes Bush at his word -- that he intended to bring them Democratic Republican government -- one still can't help but notice what he really brought them was a massive civil war that was 100% totally predictable.    It was predictable because we saw it happen before.   In lots of other nations marred by years of dictatorship, composed of multiple ethnic groups with a history of not getting along too well.   

Examples that spring to mind:  

* The  former Yugoslavia after the fall of Communism.  
* Did you maybe notice all those wars in Africa since the French, Belgians, and British went home? 
* Or pretty much all of Central, Eastern and Southern Europe at the end of both World Wars.   All the groups launched at each other in a revenge feud that lots and lots of history books have been written about.   The only thing that prevented things from getting out of hand at the end of WW2 was that Stalin wanted a bit of peace and quiet.... and it still took the Soviets a good 4-5 years to put a good lid on it all.  

And Stalin was.... well, Stalin!    A guy who makes Hussein look like a tickle-me-Elmo doll in comparison. 

And what really gets to me the most: it wasn't just predictable.  It was actually predicted.    The most vocal group that talked about that before the invasion of Iraq were Republicans who were against the invasion.  Folks like Jerry Pournelle and -- if you listen closely to what Colin Powell meant by ""pottery barn rules"" --  The then United States Secretary of State himself predicted it!  The fact that President Bush didn't listen or understand is well.... deserving of a war crimes tribunal that will never happen.

Why not? Save your wages for a little while longer so you can afford health insurance while your startup is starting up. (Income taxes are lower than in most European countries, so you can save up faster!)

When you leave your job, you can still buy into your previous employer's group health care plan for 18 months.

And if you are married, and your spouse is still working for an employer, rather than joining you in your startup, you can get coverage through their health plan.

Allies were needed with functional economies and democratic governments, and we foot the bill.  The issue was never whether the Soviets would attack America, but whether they would have spread over/attacked Europe.  I believe that without American assistance, the answer is yes.

Third, and I believe this is most important, ""police"" is just a nice way of saying empire.  Our mini wars are all about resource control, and believe me, Europe benefits from these wars as much as we do (in terms of resources, terrorism is another matter).  It's Pax Americana, we facilitate trade world wide and in return it will be to our benefit.  So the citizens of Europe can self righteously complain about American imperialism all they want, but their leaders want to maintain a high standard of living at the expense of others just as much as ours do.

There are three stereotypes that can (not always, there are exceptions) really make bus rides unpleasant. The most obvious is the homeless. There's tons of them. I lived in LA for two years, and LA is nothing compared to Honolulu. Think about it, if you're going to be homeless, why not live somewhere where it's warm year round? That's the mentality. There are streets here where they're literally every few feet, just chillin with the bros and the voices in their head.
The second group is the hippies. They're worse than the homeless. For some reason, they have it in their head that *eu de pot et B.O.* is the new Axe body spray. Being hippies they generally have a bike, but sometimes hippies get it in their mind that they need to go further than their north shore commune. That requires bus ridesies (yes, ridesies, it's like rides, but more fun. Except for me). For some reason they never want to sit either. It's that whole, ""be nice to everyone so my karma will go up"" mentality (if only they knew they could just get free karma on reddit), which makes them want to let other people sit.

True,1426035658,1251947798,1,"No offense. But listen to yourselves! You're pissed off that someone's opinion runs counter to The Popular Narrative.

Anybody who isn't totally drunk on Allied Propaganda knows that political tensions in Central Europe preceded Hitler. In World War One, 15% of Germany was carved off and given to the victors. Some of it--the lucrative German-speaking Alsace region (with all its factories)--went to France. The majority of it, though, ended up as a contribution to the new Polish state. Pilsudski--the Polish George Washington--conducted ethnic cleansings on Germans (who had lived on those lands for centuries) to ""Polonize"" the land. There were mass-killings of German-speakers, whose property and farms were then given to ethnic Poles.

Germany complained to the League of Nations. You can even see pre-World War II pictures on the internet of the genocide-attempt conducted by the Poles--which explains why the Germans were greeted as liberators during World War Two when they came back to these lands.

In other words, Germany didn't technically invade ""Poland"". They returned to provinces that had been German, pre-World War One--and where everyone spoke German, had names like Dieter, Hans and Fritz and ate wiener-schnitzl.

I mean, imagine if the U.S. had lost a war and, say, Brazil declared that it had the legal right to portion off 15% of the United States' landmass to Mexico. Now imagine Mexicans coming into Arizona, Nevada and California and killing English-speakers with names like Smith, Jones and Williams. Now imagine a mere ten years later, if the U.S. sent troops back into the still-overwhelmingly English-speaking states and took the land back. (The English-speakers--who would have had their land given to Spanish-speaking Mexicans, and who would have been second-class Mexican citizens overnight--would have cheered to high Heaven.)

That's basically what happened after World War One, with Germany and these -- ahem! -- ""Polish"" provinces.

Unless you know these facts, history is incomprehensible. It starts making sense, though, when you dispense with propaganda and learn more about the regions and the players involved.

1.  There is no evolutionary reason to have a mind that believes Santa Claus exists, thus the fact that children can even conceive of him and believe in him proves he exists. (Valid because there is equal evidence for both Santa and God)

2.  Think of the mind-boggling amount of people who have personally been touched by Santa and his elves. I'm not even talking about ""A Night Before Christmas"", but the millions of personal accounts, some by former skeptics. (Valid for the same reason)

True,1426035669,1251949753,2,"There is post on the front page right now from the AskReddit subreddit asking American redditors what they think about socialism and why they might oppose it. The majority of answers are related to American individualism, ignorance, or sometimes even the unwillingness of the American public to change. While these may be some reasons for some people, they are generally reasons given for others instead of for ones self. I'm here, then to explain to Europeans, and even other Americans, why we have the institutions that we do, and the economic ""policies"" that we do. While this is by no means anywhere near comprehensive, it is, however, a more intellectual look at American politics and history than is generally written about on reddit.

I expect this to be long and I will do my best to be as clear as possible. Obviously, I am happy to clarify or answer more in depth questions if I can. I fear that posts like this will rarely be read for fear of length. Instead people will look for shorter, less accurate answers and feel content, regardless of their validity.

To begin, we should lay out certain definitions. I use more classical definitions and terms than most of the public does today if for no other reason than to be consistent. Certain -isms have changed or mean different things to different people. No one sets out to create an -ism, it is just a grouping of like minded ideas by later scholars and are thus flexible, but making them too flexible makes them aimless and ineffective as tools of understanding.

Liberalism - The perception that the individual freedom--the ability to do, think, and say what one wants so long as it does not harm another--and equality under the law are the basic tenants of a political system.

Socialism - That everyone should be entitled to the same economic standard, i.e. equality of goods.

Communism - A totalitarian means to meet the goals of socialism. (A form of government.)

Democracy - a system of government in which the people vote or are represented in a legislature and make laws by majority rule. (A form of government.)

Republic - A system of government that uses aspects of democracy, oligarchy, and monarchism. This type of government generally has a constitution which protects natural and/or human rights, provides certain protections for the minority, creates a legal code, and restricts the powers of the government. An independent judiciary is usually also named as an important component. (A form of government)

Those aren't exact definitions, they are off the top of my head and pulled from the various texts and teachings that I've read/had. If you take issue with them, then I welcome your comments, but for the purposes of my perspective which I will lay out shortly, those are the definitions I'm using.

To begin, I wish to talk firstly of the creation and birth of our nation and the history of ideas that lent themselves to our development. This information seems to be missing from history courses overseas, and even Americans are not intimate with the details.

When the British and other Europeans first moved to the shores of the American continent, they had to figure out a way in which to govern themselves. They were thousands of miles away from any other government on earth, and thus had no one to look to for direction except for themselves. Towns, villages, and counties formed legislative bodies that would create the local laws and rules. As the colonies grew, the colonists either voted for governors and leaders or the King appointed them, depending on the charter of the territory. As time wore on, the colonists became more solidified, and their differences with Britain became more and more apparent. Lifestyle, politics, and economy were all completely different, almost polar opposites. 

After the French and Indian War, War of the Conquest, or the Seven Years War (whichever name you prefer), the British were in debt. They thought that because they had spent to resources fighting in America, that the Americans should be the ones to make up the debt. Certain taxes were levied and they didn't sit well with the American people. It was not the idea of paying money to a government that set them off (as many conservatives today might try and claim) but rather, that they had to be so subjected to the whim of a parliament and king that was thousands of miles away and so disconnected from their of ways, perceptions, and understandings. They had no say in the process and demanded representation. This was not given, and soon the colonists became angry enough to want revolution. Thus, the want for representation, or a say in how they were governed, was the reason for revolution. 

The historical significance of this action, at this point in time was little as it seemed like any other rebellion a nation might have. What came next, though, was what is truly groundbreaking.

Instead of adopting a form of government that already existed, taking a king or likewise, the citizens of these newly freed states began to work on a completely new form of government, one that had never been seen on earth before. While this may seem like an American simple bragging about his nation's history, while it is some of that, there is good reason and it has nothing to do with nationalism. If it were any other nation that did this, I would hold just as much respect for the events that transpired as I do for those that happened here.

Governments were generally something that was formed through strength of some lord and his army and then evolved through time, very much like Britain's government. But our government that we set up, began with the signing of a legal document by representatives of the people of the various states. If that isn't enough to make it an extraordinary event in history, then perhaps the rest will. The document contained measures to restrict the powers of government, not just one branch, but the whole of the government. Rights of the people were protected by the inclusion of a bill of rights and a completely independent judicial branch of government. That, in itself, shows the kind of respect for the law that this nation was founded upon. My knowledge of other nations and their governments is limited, but from what I understand, this is still a fairly unique trait of the American system. Even in Britain, the parliament can overrule a ruling of their highest court (If this is incorrect, please feel free to let me know). Added to this constitution was the separation of the powers of government in order to keep tyranny from overcoming our own government. While this has worked, there are those that would argue that Bush and administrations like his prove the weakness of the constitution. While I understand this sentiment, we must remember, that our republic has stood for more than 200 years and we have not had an individual like Hitler or Robespierre come into power, this fact is significant when comparing the viability of a democracy and a republic. 

Those of you reading are probably wondering why I'm spending so much time reviewing the form of American government or, more generally, republics. My aim is to show how it differs from governments generally found in Europe: democracies. 

European democracies are of looser form than the American republic. By this, I mean that the restrictions on the legislature are generally less and in some cases, the legislature is very nearly the government in and of itself. In many countries, the executive branch is merely an extension of the parliament, as are the courts. This means that if a party is powerful enough, they could radically change the government. Previous to the changes in some governments, this is precisely what happened.

Liberalism became pretty popular in Europe prior to the American Revolution, but afterward, it became a real viable option. The French, then, seized upon the weakness of the crown during a time of recession and turmoil and decided to set of a democracy. I think we owe the confusion of the term republic and democracy to the French (sorry guys, it's true) due to their calling themselves a republic but were, in actuality, a democracy.

We all probably know about the Terror, but I'm going to go over it again in order to stress certain aspects of European political history. Robespierre and other French intellectuals at the time believed in what is known as the ""General Will"" which means that, rationally, if people spoke openly and debated in a rational manner, that the conclusion the majority reached at the end of the deliberation would be the most rational one. Those who continued to disagree were simply irrational, and could simply be killed. This is basically liberalism and democracy gone wrong.

True,1426035667,1251949778,2,"Due to that, both conservatism and socialism were formed. You see, Europe has this bad habit of throwing the baby out with the bath water when it comes to politics. If a new idea doesn't work the first time or exactly as they thought it would, then they run in the opposite direction as far as possible and try that. Conservatives either thought that monarchies were the best solution, or some other form of oligarchical liberal government. Socialists believed that the lower class needed to rise up, take over the government (through voting, generally) and then spread the wealth. This may seem like simplification, and it probably is, but it is no less accurate.

Britain, due to the reaction of the French Revolution, became conservative (ex: Burke et al) while the rest of Europe moved in the more socialist direction. The majority of Europe, though, was stuck between the ideals of liberalism and the ideals of socialism, mostly because the basics of the two are similar (but not the same). They both seek the equality of all people, but by different means. Liberals want to keep government from infringing on individuals rights, and thus everyone would be equal under the law. Socialists thought that no one could truly be equal until we all had the same economic equality. Socialism became a very large movement and some 30-40% of the various populations of Europe were probably considered social during the early to mid 19th century.

There were several ""revolutions"" around the mid 19th century. Many of them failed and Europe again had a backlash. The liberals and conservatives of the various Europeans nations saw what they believed to be the dangers of Socialism and became Nationalists. This nationalism would later be the reason for the two great wars (WWI and WWII). In Russia, the socialist revolutions eventually succeeded and communism was the adopted form of government. The certain form of marxism that the communists abide by thought that before there could be no government (as Marx suggested would be the eventual outcome of a socialist revolution) that a group of intellectuals would have to be in charge to make sure things moved in the proper direction. I think we all know how that turned out.

But back to Europe. After WWII Europe was left with an ill feeling towards nationalism (which persists to this day) and moved back in the direction of socialism and liberalism. Most nations generally have a sort of mix between them.

While all this was happening, the American Republic remained remarkably stable. This could have been due to our relative isolation from the events in Europe, but considering several South American nations had similar (and still do) political swings, I think that it rests with our well crafted republic. I think this idea, whether most Americans have thought about it or not, is intuitive to Americans, and we are pretty reluctant to change something that has worked quite well for us. It also makes it hard for us to take political advice from a group of nations that has been in political turmoil since the start (with perhaps the exception of Britain who has changed very slowly over time).

With all that said, I have a bit more philosophy to add to that that is my personal opinion on the matter:

In the United States, we believe in Liberty and Equality (under the law) above all else when it comes to government, or at least we did when we created ours (the opinions of modern Americans may be different, I am unsure). Freedom is the ability to do whatever we wish without regulation. Liberty is often confused with freedom. While the two are related, there is a distinct and important difference. Liberty is the freedom to do whatever you want so long as it does no restrict anthers ability to also do so. This means that we limit our own freedom in order to maximize freedom for all. 

In my opinion, the same principles would be carried over to the economic realm. Unbridled capitalism, like unbridled freedom, actually stunts liberty and does not promote equality. However, socialism, like totalitarianism, is much too extreme and controlling and it limits freedom so much that liberty is again stunted and while it promotes economic equality, it limits political equality. I then, that economic liberty is the answer. That we should be able to do whatever we want economically so long as it does not limit the economic and political freedoms of others. In other words, I support regulation in the economic realm as much as I do in the political realm, no more, and no less. I do not think that a man should be able to kill his neighbor, and I do not think that a company should be able to make products, that, if used as intended, would do so either (obviously, someone can misuse a product and kill themselves or others, but my point remains).

I do not think that moving to an extreme like socialism or pure, unbridled capitalism is the answer.",t3_9gsxj,c0cpxgh,,False,,,0,PoliticalPhilosophy,False,t5_2qn9g,0,t1_c0cpxfn,2,t1_c0cpxgh,genuinepolitician,0

I'd like to stop all our wars. I'd like for everyone to have access to good health care. I'd like a lot of things. However, none of it really matters at this point. All this just distracts from the fact that we are screwed. In terms of being royally fucked: it doesn't matter what we do at this point, and it hasn't mattered for a long while. It doesn't matter if we get national health care anymore than it mattered who got elected last election. Symbolic victories which don't effect reality in any way other than being a distraction. Our system is so royally screwed that nothing short of disaster will ever fix it. 

Maybe if our government didn't suck massive balls then the American people would have more faith in it? It's great that Canada and Europeans are happy and feel superior with what they have - good for them. Does it matter to the US? Not really. I've got more faith in the Canadian government than I do in my own, and what silly policies they enact next isn't going to change that. We can't afford what we have now, we can't afford what Canada has, we can't afford anything. Even if we *could* afford it our government couldn't manage it. 

Our government is both broke and broken. Anyone who thinks that a few hundred billion or even a couple trillion dollars matter at this point hasn't been paying any attention. The entire national health care debate lately has been absolutely nothing but a distraction from the real issues. The banks own the system, they own both parties, and they own the president. Want to know what kind of national healtcare program you're going to get (and we *will* get one)? I'll give you a hint, it'll look a lot like the proposed cap and trade system - which is to say it's not going to do anything good for it's purpose but it will definitely profit the bankers and lobbyists.

True,1426035747,1251958027,3,"October 23, 2003:  Newly uncovered scientific data of recorded history's most massive space storm is helping a NASA scientist investigate its intensity and the probability that what occurred on Earth and in the heavens almost a century-and-a-half ago could happen again.

see captionRight: An ultraviolet-wavelength picture of the sun taken by the ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) on Oct. 23, 2003.

In scientific circles where solar flares, magnetic storms and other unique solar events are discussed, the occurrences of September 1-2, 1859, are the star stuff of legend. Even 144 years ago, many of Earth's inhabitants realized something momentous had just occurred. Within hours, telegraph wires in both the United States and Europe spontaneously shorted out, causing numerous fires, while the Northern Lights, solar-induced phenomena more closely associated with regions near Earth's North Pole, were documented as far south as Rome, Havana and Hawaii, with similar effects at the South Pole.

What happened in 1859 was a combination of several events that occurred on the Sun at the same time. If they took place separately they would be somewhat notable events. But together they caused the most potent disruption of Earth's ionosphere in recorded history. ""What they generated was the perfect space storm,"" says Bruce Tsurutani, a plasma physicist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

 

To begin to understand the perfect space storm you must first begin to understand the gargantuan numbers with which plasma physicists like Tsurutani work every day. At over 1.4 million kilometers (869,919 miles) wide, the Sun contains 99.86 percent of the mass of the entire solar system: well over a million Earths could fit inside its bulk. The total energy radiated by the Sun averages 383 billion trillion kilowatts, the equivalent of the energy generated by 100 billion tons of TNT exploding each and every second.

But the energy released by the Sun is not always constant. Close inspection of the Sun's surface reveals a turbulent tangle of magnetic fields and boiling arc-shaped clouds of hot plasma dappled by dark, roving sunspots.

Once in a while--exactly when scientists still cannot predict--an event occurs on the surface of the Sun that releases a tremendous amount of energy in the form of a solar flare or a coronal mass ejection, an explosive burst of very hot, electrified gases with a mass that can surpass that of Mount Everest.

Below: These Northern Lights appeared over Wisconsin on Oct. 22, 2003. During the superstorm of 1859, such lights appeared as far south as Cuba and Hawaii. Photo copyright Chris VenHaus.

see caption

 

What transpired during the dog days of summer 1859, across the 150 million-kilometer (about 93 million-mile) chasm of interplanetary space that separates the Sun and Earth, was this: on August 28, solar observers noted the development of numerous sunspots on the Sun's surface. Sunspots are localized regions of extremely intense magnetic fields. These magnetic fields intertwine, and the resulting magnetic energy can generate a sudden, violent release of energy called a solar flare. From August 28 to September 2 several solar flares were observed. Then, on September 1, the Sun released a mammoth solar flare. For almost an entire minute the amount of sunlight the Sun produced at the region of the flare actually doubled.

""With the flare came this explosive release of a massive cloud of magnetically charged plasma called a coronal mass ejection,"" said Tsurutani. ""Not all coronal mass ejections head toward Earth. Those that do usually take three to four days to get here. This one took all of 17 hours and 40 minutes,"" he noted.

Below: SOHO coronagraphs captured this movie of a coronal mass ejection (CME) heading toward Earth on Oct. 22nd. NOAA forecasters expect the CME to cause a geomagnetic storm when it reaches Earth on or about Oct. 24th, but not as severe as the superstorm of 1859.

see captionNot only was this coronal mass ejection an extremely fast mover, the magnetic fields contained within it were extremely intense and in direct opposition with Earth's magnetic fields. That meant the coronal mass ejection of September 1, 1859, overwhelmed Earth's own magnetic field, allowing charged particles to penetrate into Earth's upper atmosphere. The endgame to such a stellar event is one heck of a light show and more -- including potential disruptions of electrical grids and communications systems.

Back in 1859 the invention of the telegraph was only 15 years old and society's electrical framework was truly in its infancy. A 1994 solar storm caused major malfunctions to two communications satellites, disrupting newspaper, network television and nationwide radio service throughout Canada. Other storms have affected systems ranging from cell phone service and TV signals to GPS systems and electrical power grids. In March 1989, a solar storm much less intense than the perfect space storm of 1859 caused the Hydro-Quebec (Canada) power grid to go down for over nine hours, and the resulting damages and loss in revenue were estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

""The question I get asked most often is, 'Could a perfect space storm happen again, and when?'"" added Tsurutani. ""I tell people it could, and it could very well be even more intense than what transpired in 1859. As for when, we simply do not know,"" he said.

To research the ""perfect space storm"" of 1859, Tsurutani and co-writers Walter Gonzalez, of the Brazilian National Space Institute, and Gurbax Lakhina and Sobhana Alex, of the India Institute of Geomagnetism, used previously reported ground, solar and auroral observations, and recently re-discovered ground-based magnetic- field data from Colaba Observatory in India.

I had an ulterior motive. Kurds were being ethnically cleansed. Now we just need to get the USA to invade Somalia/Darfur and we're set.

&gt;It is actually more crucial to retract your statement prior to seeking power.

That's a pretty good point. I probably should rethink my position. Do you think it's both good politics and a change in what the war was that could have change Ignatieff's point of view?

&gt;The fact that this is exactly what that war was all about (and siphoning off US middle class tax money to pay corporations via the military industrial complex) makes them right.

You need some form of a ""military industrial complex"" to have a country that can defend itself in times of war. Without the MIC the USA would have had a hell of a time during the cold war against the USSR. The MIC is incredibly important. A historical argument would be Canada in the early 1940s--we couldn't build Atlantic-faring ships even though our lives depended upon it. Or naval sensory equipment like the precursor to radar (ours seamen had to buy it off of an Englishman at a price of a bottle of rye whiskey).

I find it terrible that Reddit has such a hard on for bashing the MIC. It's an important facet of the USA and how it can establish itself as the world's remaining super power. Although, I do agree with you that abusing it is an absolutely terrible thing. Blackwater (now ""Xe""), and a whole bunch of other contractors have completely screwed up over there. I agree with you that this is a terrible--no, a catastrophic--waste of money and has hit Americans quite hard.

However, to say that the war was only about enriching a few corporations is down right foolish. The geopolitical map of the region has been reshaped and moved onto a different path. People 200 years from now will look back and say that this was one of the pivotal moments that changed the future of the middle east.

The USA no longer needs to kowtow to Israel any more. It has an ally (sort of) in Iraq.

The States can move their troops out of Saudi Arabia now (if they wanted to), thus removing Osama's main point against the USA.

There's another democracy in the region now. Mind you, it is a fledgling one, but are some basic democratic traditions being formed as we type this right now. There is now a line of democracies from the Mediterranean to China/India (yes, I'm including the Islamic Republic of Iran). If the world, and these nations, play their cards right we can lift up millions of people to the standard of living that we enjoy in the west through the power of self government. 

The possibility is there for a great renaissance in the middle east. It's just going to be a tad bit tough getting it off the ground.

In addition to this, the royalties that Iraq is getting are incredible. Absolutely incredible. Rather than Saddam's guns it'll be paying for schools, hospitals, and rebuilding Iraq. Mind you, none of it is going to the USA's debt and quite a bit of the oil sites were sold extraordinarily cheap to American corporations. And that tribal influences will dictate where a lot of the money goes. 

Thing is, though, is that tribal influences were still huge under Saddam and the US corporations were still getting a decent cut out of Iraq's oil during the time that he was the USA's pet. That money, that wealth, is now mostly helping Iraqis raise their standard of living. Hopefully it'll create some level of stability for Iraq.

&gt;If you have no moral guidance on this

Don't worry. ;) I don't.

&gt;than at least understand that from a Machiavellian perspective it is really stupid to be part of a ""coalition of the willing"" that probably 70% of the earth's population hates.

Ah, but Canada was never in danger of joining the coalition of the willing. Ignatieff, from the stuff I've read about him, just wanted to symbolically support the US. No troops would have been committed under a Liberal PM for Bush's lil' war on terror, whatever the leader then.

Harper, on the other hand...

&gt;Neo-liberalism is bad because it is a system premised on exploiting people while pretending you are doing them a fucking favour.

Neo-liberalism is based on liberalism. Neo = New. New-liberalism. Liberalism is based on a mix between Individualism (supporting the individual, thinking in terms of individuals which make up larger groups, and assisting individuals reach enlightenment/success/self-actualization) and equality (blank slate, helping people, assistance to those weaker than us, etc).

I agree that the Neo-liberal doctrine has lost its naiveté of idealism that could have been inherited from its elder brother Liberalism. There is a serious lacking in the ""hope"" and ""change"" department, and the idea that nation states can be one giant happy family. It has been influenced by neo-conservatism and has been hit rather hard by right-wing nuts trying to infuse power politics + ""Realism"" into it. 

But to say that it abuses the people it tries to help? No, I disagree. Through Liberal Institutionalism and Democratic Peace Theory, in addition to a whole bunch of other sub-categories within Neo-liberalism, I think it's a very worthy ideology. A lot of good is happening around the world--Mexico almost has the same life expectancy and infant mortality (adjusting for the US' weird system of birth-counting, of course) now. Africa has sustained continual growth over the last decade (with a few rough patches in the Congo + Rwanda, but that's a colonialism issue, really). There is an optimistic outlook right now. Things are improving and I think that Neo-liberalism deserves at least a little bit of credit for helping the world.

&gt;I'm not sure how old you are, you keep telling me to ""leave this to the adults.""

I only wrote it once and it was only to goad you into replying. I enjoy debate like this. (If you go back into my history you might see that I've argued threads like this that tally about 10,000+ in their word count.) I'm glad you've agreed to this debate by replying. :)

By the way, I'm 20.

&gt;However, what is clear is you don't read an awful lot or generally critically engage with things on a day-to-day level.

Mleh. I disagree.

&gt;it looks like you are actually someone who likes some of the nice things we have built in this country like public health care and affordable education,

We agree that we should protect these unique and awesome Canadian institutions. We probably agree that we should improve them, too. Lower tuition, etc.

&gt;though the second we have already seen dismantled before our eyes.

I pay $6,000 in tuition every year (includes books) for the BA I'm getting at an Albertan University. I have food/shelter costs of about $2,000 a month. In the USA I'd be hit with $25,000/year for tuition for the same degree program in addition to health insurance + costs reaching the point of $3,000 a month. Although I'd like to pay less, and comparing to the USA makes me feel better it doesn't change the fact that we can still improve our system, what's wrong with the post secondary system?

I know we can't have free education--like a sizable chunk of Europe, btw--but what's this about the secondary ed' system being dismantled? It's the first time I've heard about it. Could you please elaborate? Links, perhaps?

&gt;Hell, I can afford private health care if they keep managing to trick guys like you into voting for them.

The Liberals brought universal health care to all of Canada and it is the party that will protect it no matter what. The Conservatives need to an hero themselves.

&gt;Vote for Ignatieff if you want to, by all means, that is your right. Though I would never even dream of voting for Harper myself I can at least respect the people who do. At least they actually know what it is they are voting for when they cast that ballot.

You aren't a Green. That's for sure. They're a tad bit more right wing than Harper's Conservatives, and you seem to be against such right-wing stupidity. This also knocks out Harper. You also dislike Ignatieff. That leaves two parties--Communist and the NDP. Obviously, you're not a Communist by the way you've been arguing and the underlying thoughts you've shown through your argumentation.

Well, Joshua Jargon, I can only assume that you support Jack Layton's NDP. Or you're an angry Canadian who has no one in the ring fighting for him/her. Either way, I'd like to hear your thoughts defending either position because I find both absolutely ghastly choices.

So people will tend to support more socialism if they view economic equality as a higher principle than individual liberty. Or they simply disagree with what individual's are doing with their property. For example, individuals might be destroying the environment or not helping others. 

Other people will view individual liberty as a higher principle and so will tend to support capitalism, i.e. the *free* markets.

The fact is neither the US or Europe are really capitalist or socialist. Property, such as labor, homes, land, intellectual, etc, is treated differently in each country, so it's not so easy to make blanket statements like ""the US is capitalist"" and ""Sweden is socialist."" 

To answer the OP question, I think that individual liberty is main the principle in which our country was founded, and I believe this is a great thing. The problem with socialism is that it places too much power in the hands of the government. We are in effect at the mercy of the progressives making decisions for us. So private property is way to ensure that we can live our lives as we see fit.

We got reading about what marriage meant before the Church got into the gig around the 11th century or so: what it boiled down to is stating your intentions to form a lifelong bond with someone in front of family and friends in a celebratory fashion. We threw one hell of a party. People are still talking about it. Even if CA forced us to get ""divorced,"" I would still be with my wife. Cause she's awesome, and was the 6 years we were together before we got married.

2. I would certainly stop frequenting your business, and would let my friends and family know that you put your money where your mouth is, and point out that by them going there they are putting their money where your mouth is too. Would I burn the place down or vandalize it? No. Absolutely not. Would I try and get you fired? Well, are you verbally abusing me at my place of business and denying me a promotion based solely on my orientation? Then yes, I would. Otherwise, no.

3. Marriage, as soon as it was announced in CA, was announced to me by my friend as soon as it became legal. We made plans, and found time about a month before the election. So it breaks down 90% planned, 10% fear the ""window would shut."" We were so bitterly disappointed when we heard the news.

4. I suppose if you were the checkout girl..sure, I guess. In general, I usually don't talk politics and religion. I use the internet to vent, but in my general public life, I state facts about how not being able to enjoy the legal aspects of marriage puts a damper on a lot of things, and move on. Other than that, I really don't ever leave my house, so our chances would be slim anyway.

5. Civil unions, as currently understood, are not the same as marriage, in a legal sense. If civil unions is a word the gov't will use to replace the current legal rights and responsibilities of marriage (about 1,049 state and federal), then that is fine with me. I have always said this is a matter of rights, not religion. I haven't stepped foot in a church since 2003, and I have no plans to ever do so again. So if a church does not wish to recognize my union, well, more power to them. It's their right as Americans. I just wish to have the legal protections, as my family has legal rights as next of kin, but are absolutely not a part of my life and should have no right to my property after death, etc.

6. Science. There are many studies that show that incest carries very heavy psychological landmines. Polygamy: no problem. I don't care for it, so I won't do it. But if consenting adults wish to enter into a menage-a-whatever, more power to them.

7. Thanks. It's actually gone by very smoothly. We did estate planning 4 years ago, have lived together for 6, had a wedding 3 years ago and just finally got the marriage certificate a year ago. Sorry to say, but almost anti-climactic.

3,700 Finns, more than 5,000 Russians of the North West White Army, 9,800 Latvians, 3,000 British, 400 Swedes and 250 Danes and up to 700 Baltic Germans)

But none-the-less, even the smallest number of men was an important contribution, but an amount of 5 to 20 thousand was -I agree- indeed huge.

 &gt; the reason estonians didn't see germans as the ""bad guy"" is because they sympathized with nazis like finland for *whatever reason*.

The reason is, for the common folks here the whole WW2 goes a bit like this: 

* Baltic Germans live in Estonia for hundreds of years, they are okay. 
* World War 2 started, Baltic Germans were invited to Germany by Hitler, they left. 
* Estonia was a neutral independent country - then along come the Russians saying we need protection from Germans, start harassing and we have to let their troops in -  a 10 year treaty is signed. They start looting, raping, stealing, killing, repressing and transporting people away. 
* Then Germans come - Russians flee, Germans kill Jews but on the same time keep it in secret and don't do much bad to the local people, the common people is unaware of the negative aspect of German regime.
* Along come the Russians again - Germans flee, Russians declare we need liberating and take us over - and again start killing, deporting and repressing the local people and its culture. Local people think ""hmm, Germans didn't do that"". 

The thing is, as paradoxical as it is, Estonia has had better luck with German regimes and thus in local people's eyes, they were an enemy, but not the *worse* one. So if they were given an option to fight on either side, they chose the German side. It has absolutely nothing to do with nazis, it has all to do with the one fact that it was just a *lesser of two evil regimes*.

Almost all of Africa was conquered and divided up and no one thought to consult the people that lived there before. Even now China is setting up shop to supply themselves with whatever resources are left. 

One could also argue that Africa is a victim of world socialism. Almost all first world nations send aid to Africa and it's not getting any better for the people that don't live in developed former colonies. I'm not against sending aid to Africa at all, but I don't see any nation really offering citizenship or refugee status to them, or teaching them useful skills or knowledge. They don't need to be able to sell things or make money to survive. They need knowledge. All we give them is food and missionaries.

America is like Africa in that respect. If they had had a chance or the will to stand up and save something for themselves, it may be different for them now. Same with Native Americans. But in the end it was our ancestors that fought back and started whatever it is we have now. No one provided for this continent before the first taxes were laid. 

The fight now is against **state** socialism and **corporate** capitalism. And retaining the knowledge and ability to produce the things we need and stand up for ourselves if we have to while still having free time left over to advance as a people. As Humans.

Observing the US, there is one thing in particular that flags why socialisation is not a good thing, which is population - I feel that the larger a population grouping, the more distant the relationship between the people and government will likely be (and I think this is the case in the US), and the more distant that relationship is, the more inclined the government will be to ignore the wishes of the people. I feel the same applies to the EU. How many people in Europe actually feel any kind of connection to the EU government? I believe that the centralisation of power over a large population will almost invariably be a dangerous thing. I feel that irrelevant of left and right, devolving power to smaller population groupings is almost always better than centralising. One of the things I like the most about America's system is that much power is devolved to the individual states - I really like that principle.

That's just a casual observation - I'd be open to other people's opinions on the matter. There is also the factor of how much power private companies wield - a small government that allows companies to do as they wish without any kind of oversight - allowing them to form unseen anti-competitive cabals of industries, crucially including the news media - that doesn't seem much more appealing than a more socialised system.

&gt;There is a widespread myth about what people want rhino horns for - 
in fact two myths. The first myth is that ground rhino horn is an 
aphrodisiac. This, I think it's safe to say, is just what it appears 
to be - superstition. It has little to do with any known medical 
fact, and probably a lot to do with the fact that a rhino's horn is a 
big sticky-up hard thing.
The second myth is that anyone actually believes the first myth.
It was probably the invention of a journalist, or at best a 
misunderstanding. It's easy to see where the idea came from when you 
consider the variety of things that the Chinese, for example, believe 
to be aphrodisiacs, which include the brain of a monkey, the tongue 
of a sparrow, the human placenta, the penis of a white horse, rabbit 
hair from old brushes, and the dried sexual parts of a male tiger 
soaked in a bottle of European brandy for six months. A big sticky-up 
hard thing like a rhinoceros horn would seem to be a natural for such 
a list, though it's perhaps harder to understand, in this context, 
why grinding the thing down would be such an attractive idea. The 
fact is that there is no actual evidence to suggest that the Chinese 
do believe rhino horn to be an aphrodisiac. The only people who do 
believe it are people who've read somewhere that other people believe 
it, and are ready and willing to believe anything they hear that they

You need professional help (and 4-8K) to get it filed and then a further 4-8K to get to grant. After filing you have a year (from filing) to decide if you're going to go for other territories, a world-wide, a European (which then overlaps with the original UK filing) and so on and so on. You want it covered in Japan? Well, you'll need to get it translated at your own expense and re-formatted for their offices, plus more expense, more time and so on.

From his own writings, and from the the plans that he had set beforehand, we know he had intentionally moved the goalposts of his demands to Czechoslovakia every time his demands were met in an attempt to force them into failing the demands and sparking a war. 

He wrote of his frustrations that he didn't get his war. He wrote that eastern expansion either ""with Britain, without Britain, or against Britain"" was the only way his country could overcome its mounting upside-down debts and looming economic collapse. After Britain repeatedly turned down his attempts to form an alliance with them, he started plans to expand ""against Britain,"" thinking that Britain would surrender quickly if they were directly bombed. His military advisers warned him against invading Poland, saying that France would intervene and Britain would support France, and that Germany wasn't ready to fight both at once. Hitler choose to trust his own regional expert instead, who assured him that France would let Poland go without a fight.

&gt;But if Hitler was out to conquer the world … why did he spend three years building that hugely expensive Siegfried Line to protect Germany from France? Why did he start the war with no surface fleet, no troop transports and only 29 oceangoing submarines? How do you conquer the world with a navy that can’t get out of the Baltic Sea? … Why did he offer the British peace, twice, after Poland fell, and again after France fell?

This is pretty much what his advisers told him. It's pretty clear, from Hitler's own writings, that he thought he would win anyway. Hitler tried so many times to instigate war, that just because he hoped France and Britain wouldn't defend Poland doesn't mean he didn't push Europe into war. He rearmed Germany in violation of the Treaty of Versailles; he invaded his neighbors, who were allies of other European powers; he openly made alliances with powers hostile to the allies. He basically shat on everyone around Germany until Europe was sick of it. His actions, if not his own words and his own writings, clearly demonstrates that he wanted a war.

You realize that most people who are deniers of the Shoah are not saying that it did not happen, don't you?  They are saying it did not go down the way the Shoah business demand it did.  Take the case of David Cole. A young Jewish holocaust denier, posing as a believer, puts some hard questions to the senior curator of the Auschwitz State Museum. After making this video, a ""hit"" was put out on Cole, and a reward for information on his whereabouts was issued by Irv Rubin (who years later, was arrested by the FBI for planning to kill a Lebanese-American Congressman.) Fearing assassination, Cole went into hiding. He never surfaced again publicly.  Now my point all along is not the finer points of the holocaust, but rather if we were in Europe having this debate/discussion one if not both of us would be sitting in solitary.  The truth needs no laws to protect it.  End of discussion.

""Individualistic"" has the wrong connotation maybe. They surely do their own thing, but keep more long-term relationships with other people, among other things through not moving as often or as far, long-term memberships of local organizations, etc., which makes superficial acquaintances more meaningful.

The argument contra that is used is stability, of course: a small party can in theory take a gov't hostage. Even in coalition systems the seats aren't always attributed proportionally, but with a division system that gives the largest parties an advantage; although in practice, the small extremist party extorting the big party that needs its votes, rarely, if ever, happens.

* Cartoons showing Mohammed, two as a violent person. According to the Quran, Mohammed was a mass-murderer, terrorist and pedosexual. There are no non-Islamic sources for his existence.

Mohammed has been pictured for centuries, mostly by Muslims themselves. They now claim to be offended by it, especially when he is shown to be violent, which is written in the Quran itself. 

* A cartoon showing Jews, claiming they faked the deaths of 70+% of their kin in Europe. Many survivors of WW2 still live. Many Jews lost grandparents, parents and other close family.

The right of existence of the Apartheidsstate of Israel has cleverly been tied to the Holocaust. To disprove this claim, one would have to disprove the well-documented mass-murder. Muslims, who are not as familiar with Western culture as you might think, fell into this trap. Instead of pointing at the oppression and death the Israeli Apartheidsstate is responsible for, they make themselves look foolish by trying to disprove facts. This isn't helping their case. By opposing Holocaust denial, Western governments try to steer them on the right path. Hence, this case.

Also, the claims of discrimination are pathetic. The Danish cartoons were extremely kind to Mohammed, he isn't shown fucking a child, terrorising Mecca or murdering dozens of Jewish males after the battle of the trench in any of them.

Anyhow, I kept messing with her hair on camera, playing piano in the background, she kept trying to hit me, and then we were sent outside to play because we were beings, well, kids.

We're outside playing on the swings and the merry-go-round... There was a pillow on a seat, so I took it and hit her with it. She kicked me in the crotch, I went down...

Fast-forward 13 years or so....

I had just gotten out of a on-again, off-again relationship, had some friends bail out on a road trip that EVERYONE wanted to join me on, and had some bad dates from an internet dating site. At that point, I basically said that I was pretty much done with dating, and wouldn't have a problem with being single forever.

So she comes to visit said aunt for a bit to see the country, and both of them then come down to Texas for my mother's surprise 50th birthday party. I was hiking in the Grand Canyon at the time, having a blast. My mom's sister called me while I was gone to tell me that this Polish girl was coming... I said, ""Whatever... don't care, won't be there."" Last I thought of it.

So this girl stays - she wants to see more of the country, and Mom's happy to help... with ulterior motives of matchmaking, of course. So I come home early one Saturday morning, after a few weeks on the road, unshaved and smelling like a yak during the warm months. I talk to Dad for a few minutes - Mom's gone shopping with this girl, then take a nice, long hot shower. It was my first real one in a week or so, so I enjoyed it for a while. Anyhow, I'd forgotten about her, and just tossed on a pair of boxers and headed to the kitchen to get something to eat... 

She was there. Looking at me in my near-naked glory. With a pudge, in my underwear, still unshaved.

Shit.

Turned around, went back to my room, got dressed, came back for the meet-and-greet...

The next day, I forgot about her, so I wandered into the kitchen again in my boxers, this time unshowered... There she was again...

Shit.

Turned around, went back to my room, got dressed.

Anyhow, I got assigned chauffeur duties for her and my 13 year-old-cousin, who was also came to visit from Poland at the same time. I took them all over Texas, to show them around, etc... Eventually it got serious with her... 

OK, it took me three weeks from the ""serious"" part to giving her a ring. She looked like she was about to throw up. Good times.

She did say yes, though.

So then, it was a ""let's not tell my parents yet..."" thing. Hell, we didn't tell my cousin - he was with us ALL the time, and basically we knew that he was my mother's spy. We kept it up pretty damned well, too. My mother and her aunt were still plotting on how to get us together...

Cue a few weeks ahead...

Mom and Dad were leaving on a week-long trip, getting the car packed, running late. We decided that was the best time to spring the news on them. About two minutes or so before they leave, We tell Mom that we have something to tell them. Dad's pissed because Mom's making them late. Mom was pissed because she was running late, her shirt was on backwards and she didn't have time to fix it, and the tag was chafing her neck. She spins around, mad as hell, and yells, ""WHAT? What do you want to tell me?""

Forgot what I was going to say... She just held out her hand, and Mom saw the ring.

So Mom starts laughing, and Dad looks like someone kicked him in the stomach - pale, and a weak smile. Hugs all around, my cousin come running in to see what the commotion was about, and then get pissed at us for not telling him before.

Dad says, ""OK - time to go!"", and they leave.

After they come back, Mom told us we ruined Dad's vacation. Five minutes out from the house, the conversation runs like this:

Dad: When did you find out? 

Mom: Just now! When you did! 

Dad: You mean they didn't tell you before?

Mom: No!

Dad: Oh...

Few miles down the road...

Dad: So... is she pregnant?

Mom: How should I know? I just found out about this, too?!?!!?

So Dad spent a week thinking she was knocked up. He called a few times to make sure everything was OK... and never asked us. Guess he was too afraid the answer could have been ""yes.""

She wasn't.

With her visa running out, we tried to get it converted to a student one, but it was a pain. It was easier just to get married by the JP, and be done with it. Dad actually said, ""Well, you gave her a ring, might as well get married...""

It took three weeks from ""serious"" to ""engaged"".
It took a month and a half from ""enagaged"" to ""everyone knows.""
It took two more weeks by the time we got to ""Well, you gave her a ring..."", and two weeks from THAT to get to ""I do.""

Pretty fast, but it worked well for us.

Typical Polish wedding reception - lots to drink, lots of food, long into the night. Typical wedding games, too: the kitchen utensils/hot sausage game, egg game, foot-identification game... Debauchery all around.

Of course, at the reception, Dad just *had* to play the video from 13 years before. Turn out he had been standing on the balcony watching us and taping the crotch-kicking, and he played it for everyone right after we left. My best man thought it was so funny he fell out of his chair laughing. He said it was the most fun he's ever had at a wedding.

Of course, his wife hit him on their drive home. They took a few years to get engaged, and then married... Her words were, ""See? It look them TWO WEEKS!!!!!""

Good times...

So for the first year, the rumors on both sides of the Atlantic were that she:
* was pregnant (Not!)
* was only after a green card (She wants to move to Europe)
* was after the vast family fortune (Ha! Me too!)

If we are talking about socialism in the western European sense that is a different matter. That is a mixed economy that has been shown to work for decades.

What I find interesting in America is the way people have been indoctrinated into thinking that the most basic action that will advantage the man in the street is branded as socialism. This is done very cleverly by the already advantaged. They have the power and means to get their propaganda across. Because of this the man in the street is the looser.

Compare employment law as an example. The USA is years behind Europe. Employees here are treated like stock on a shelf, to be discarded at a whim. Holidays, working hours, benefits, all way ahead.

The best example of misunderstanding of European socialism is when I have been in discussion with people and I have stated that Tony Blare, Americas best buddy, is or was, the leader of a socialist party and prime minister of GB, they are astounded. Some of the reactions I have had have been laughable and sad at the same time.

A strong democracy can accept all sorts. I bet Americans are not aware the GB was voting in Communist Members of Parliament up until the sixties. Why? Because we were strong enough and open minded enough to give them a platform.

You will see no change in the USA until elected members are not bought off by business interests. That can be done by them declaring an interest and not taking part in the debate or vote on legislation that involves companies and associations that have paid them money.

While many would like to believe that social programs, socialism, Marxism, communism, and fascism are distinct and separate, that is a lie.  When evil shit happens in the world, it rarely happens where people just magically wake up one day and all of a sudden, ""hey there's genocide going on here!!!""  No, evil takes a path, and that path is almost always socialism - also notice how never since the birth of human kind has there has never existed a social program that has decreased in cost and size and power over peoples lives.  

Consider China land reform, with the promise of providing for everyone's food, well that led to land confiscation (in itself a violent act), then to central management, then to mass corruption and inefficiencies, then to the death of 30 million peasants.  As of late, people think the social programs in Europe are more tame, permanently contained, however they too require aggression and force to impose, they too must always expand, and will eventually (perhaps slowly) expand to the point where their societies must make a choice.  Get rid of the social program, or suffer genocide.  Don't believe me? well it already happened once with the central planners in Germany.  Their central planners kept trying to make utopian communities and kept failing till they finally got fed up and put in a strong man elected by wide popular support.  

The bottom line is that socialism is violence.  It's a way of saying, well we don;t like peoples personal priorities, so we're going to come in with the state and impose our own priorities via violent force.  As in guns, confiscation of property, and escalation backed by the full force and power of the central government.

Of course accurately predicting the future is damn hard to do. But you can make an educated guess, and thus be more likely to be in a better position than the people who simply waits around and reacts to the disaster after it's already happened.

This thing could be nearly over or it could last up to another 10 years. Or more. If you think it's nearly over, then you can start making plans to take advantage of that, and be completely prepared with the resumes and the business plans once the business loans and the scholarships start flowing and the major corporations start hiring again.

If the shit stays real for 10 years, then stop buying stupid shit, smother those urges to quit your day job and go backpacking in Europe for 6 months to ""discover who you really are"", and stop dicking around on the weekends so you can start learning some secondary trades so there is still demand for you even if your current industry has had pretty much a hiring freeze for the past 5 years.

Even the founding fathers understood that some things cannot be dealt with by private entities.  

If your police force was a private entity what you would have on your hands is a very risky scenario where mercenaries would be very easily capable of taking over parts of the country.  Some parts of the world have private security forces like these.  One such part of the world is the city of Lagos in Nigeria.  There you have to pay a Lord a tax for protection.  This kind of racket makes the Lord the richest, most powerful man in his part of the city.  Protection for profit turns into a racket too easily.  Anyone with their senses should reject any offer from private entities to serve and protect. 

Private highways exist in Europe and it costs as much for gas as it does to pay toll fees on some roads.  Gas is very expensive in Europe.  Thankfully in socialist Europe the government has made deals with these highway owners so they cannot hike the prices too high.  Left to their own free will these companies would hike the prices to exorbitant amounts and force traffic to a standstill where only the wealthiest could move around.

One man was, inflation adjusted, the richest man in the world because he had a private fire department.  Marcus Licinius Crassus made his fortune by purchasing houses that were on fire.  In those times there were no insurances and a fire meant that you lost everything.  Someone looking at their house burning understood that he was losing everything.  Crassus and his crew would purchase the house at ridiculously low prices.  The ex-owner often became a tenant and a huge portion of his lifetime would be spent trying to repurchase the house.  The tiny amount that was given to him when he was desperate merely gave him enough to survive the cold season.  Right now if a fire devastates your house everyone pays a small fee to make it easy on you. A private company wouldn't give a shit about you because their bottom line is profit.

&gt;Various American evangelicals have claimed the founding fathers as believing and practicing Protestants who intended America to be a Christian nation. Secularists, on the other hand, see in the same historical record evidence that the founders were often Deists at best. Both views are grossly oversimplified, argues Waldman, cofounder and editor-in-chief of Beliefnet.com. In this engaging, well-researched study, Waldman focuses on the five founding fathers who had the most influence on religion's role in the state—Franklin, Jefferson, Washington, Adams and Madison—and untangles their complex legacy. They were certainly diverse in religiosity, with Jefferson a self-diagnosed heretic, for instance, and Washington a churchgoing Anglican who was silent on points of doctrine and refrained from taking communion. All, however, were committed to the creation of religious freedom in the new nation. Waldman deserves kudos for systematically debunking popular myths: America was not primarily settled by people seeking religious freedom; the separation of church and state did not result from the activism of secularists, but, paradoxically, from the efforts of 18th-century evangelicals; and the American Revolution was as much a reaction against European theocracy as a struggle for economic or political freedom.

While terms like ""good"" and ""evil"" are clearly subjective and have no place in a political discussion, socialism, as an economic philosophy is not conducive to freedom (I believe this is what the OP was trying to say)

Under a free market system, you are not your brother's keeper.  Nobody owes you anything, and you owe no one else anything.  Your life is yours to do with as you wish.  Be fruitless and frivolous, or be diligent and hard working.  Accept the rewards and risk (both have rewards and risks) in their entirety.

Under socialism you are your brothers keeper.  Society makes a claim on your life.  It is a form of Serfdom.  You are not property of a sovereign, but instead you are the property of your neighbor.  And your neighbor is likewise your property.  Because you are bound to each other in responsibility you suddenly have a philosophical stake in the decisions you each make.

If you see a twenty something laying about on the beach smoking weed and playing guitar in the US you think ""man, that'd be a great life. Oh well, I got to get back to work""

In Europe you see the same kid and think ""God damn it, why does he get to smoke pot and lay on the beach all day, while I've got to work my ass off?  Fuck that, I'm calling in sick today and laying out in the Sun.  What difference does it make, I can't be fired. I make the same amount of money no matter how much work I do.""

When you mitigate the risks of life on the backs of your neighbors, you unbalance the individual decision making process.  And you unbalance it towards non-productivity.  Eventually that imbalance spirals out of control until you get to a state where there is not enough food and other necessities to even survive.

If the guy to your left does half as much work as you, and you both get paid the same amount of money, you're going to stop working so hard.  Now the guy on your right sees that you're doing half as much work, and cuts his productivity in half.  The guy to his right sees what's going on, and cuts his productivity.

I have lived in Canada and the US, and I have visited a number of European countries as well as spending some time in Asia. I honestly believe that the US has the worst system of all that I have seen.

People do not seem to realize that the economic system, political system, and social system are separate entities. They can be mixed and matched willy nilly. The problem is that they all interrelate, and the systems in the USA interrelate very poorly for the most part, even though the systems that are in place are nominally 'good'.

In practical terms, the social system is disrupted by bankruptcies and illnesses (healthcare) because the social system is not being protected properly from the economic system by the political system. The environment is similarly harmed.

I was pondering earlier today how often one sees a triad of criteria, and is permitted to choose two. The cost/time/performance dilemma for software developers. I think that this criteria applies to civilization as well. Most successful countries when given a choice between the economy, politics, and social systems choose the economy and the social system. In the US it seems the choice was the economy and the political system.

This seems to be a very bad choice, as people don't need politics to live, they just need a functioning society and economy to fit into. One can't eat politics after all, and politicians aren't known for helping you when you need it. As such I think the political system in the US needs to be less concerned with the economy (read businesses) and more concerned with the social system. After all, it functions as a sort of fulcrum and at the moment things are badly imbalanced.

How a European-styled teapot with blue designs on a white background is gaudy but a bright red sari is not.

True,1426036243,1252007662,7,"You may have an learned an overstated version of the history of Christianity in Rome.

Constantine *was* the first Christian Emperor, but he didn't make Christianity the official religion of the Empire.  That version is based on a credulous interpretation of the *Donation of Constantine*, which purported to have turned over the Empire to the Church.  But the *Donation* was an 8th century forgery.

The big victory for Western Christianity under Constantine was the Edict of Milan  The Edict instituted *toleration* of Christianity, which had previously been suppressed by the Empire, and returned previously confiscated property to Christians.  Constantine *did* throw a great deal of wealth into consolidating Christianity, but most of that was concentrated in the city he founded on the Bosphorus, Constantinople.  It would soon become the capital of the Eastern, or Byzantine, Empire.

You could, perhaps, make the argument that the Orthodox Church control had an early monopoly over religion in the East, but the Roman Senate remained largely pagan, as did the Equestrian class, from which its ranks were largely drawn.  The reach of so-called Imperial Christianity into the Empire outside of the city of Rome was so weak that the Church would spend most of the next six centuries pushing the spread of Christianity into regions that Rome had conquered before the fall.  Constantine's youngest son Constans *did*, in 341, ban pagan sacrifices, but those rights were restored two decades later by the Emperor Julian, who fought to roll back many of the political gains made by Christians since the Edict of Milan.

Most of the remaining Emperors were Christian, but by this time the influence of the Empire was waning.  The Empire split before the end of the century, just 15 years before the Sack of Rome.  Rome controlled less and less of the continent, and the barbarian invasions were rapidly fragmenting the infrastructure that had held the Western Empire together.  There was no consolidated and far-reaching Imperial structure that could enforce a monopoly over religion.  Paganism remained strong, and was certainly still in practice on the Continent during the 8th century when Charlemagne took power.  While the Edict of Milan may serve as the official starting point of what we think of as Christendom (as distinct from Christianity), it was coronation of Charlemagne by Pope Leo III on Christmas Day 800 CE that was the tipping point in making Christianity the dominant religion of Europe -- nearly 500 years *after* Constantine I.

That's 500 years that need to be explained if you're going to maintain the theory that Christianity can't survive without a social monopoly -- in addition to the 300 years in which it survived at the bottom of the Roman social hierarchy.  Prior to Charlemagne's consolidation of Western Europe, there were plenty of other religions practicing on European soil, any one of which might have outstriped Christianity -- Judaism, Avar paganism, Moorish Islam on the Spanish peninsula, and any number of native European paganisms.",t3_9gw6f,c0cqt9c,,False,,,0,atheism,False,t5_2qh2p,0,t1_c0cqncj,7,t1_c0cqt9c,blackstar9000,0

Ginger, I'm not sure why you're being so defensive. It is a fairly reasonable question between two *assumably* rational persons. If someone holds a belief *not* based on reason and evidence, then it is necessarily irrational and based on faith or emotion. 

I do not think the latter is a good reason for deciding on how fundamental rights in our country should be limited.

It wasn't an accusation that you *as a woman* are being irrational. It was questioning the basis of your belief *because you claim it's immune from reexamination*. It has nothing to do with your gender, and again, I am not someone who identifies as an MRA. I'm just a guy interested in equality issues.

&gt;It's not like I just decided, 'hmmm...I think I'll think this"" without a lot of careful consideration and reading of all of the arguments.

""When two rational individuals have the same information, they must draw the same inferences and come, independently, to the same conclusion."" - Harsanyi

As I showed in my links above, there are *rational reasons* to oppose curtailing our freedom of expression in the name of protecting people from ""hatred"". 

It's not often I find myself agreeing with conservative thinkers in Canada. But they've demonstrated overwhelming support for the decision to declare these regulations unconstitutional, and I agree.

Expression, along with conscience and belief, are, *thankfully* codified as one of our *fundamental* freedoms. As such, they should be considered non-negotiable. ""Reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society"" is not carte-blance to account for the feelings of every special interest group. They allow only the most cautious limitations, which I've recognized above: libel &amp; slander for example. 

Limiting speech *because it may be offensive* is *not* justifiable in a ""free and democratic society"", as doing so changes the nature of the society to one that is *no longer free and democratic*. Without fringe groups airing their beliefs, no matter how offensive, the spectrum of dialogue in the nation is limited to that range that is determined, *by the government*, and by lobbying by interest groups, so a ""nice, polite, mainstream-acceptable"" set of opinions.

Without an *absolute* protection of free speech, it becomes up to bureaucrats, and lawyers for groups seeking to curtail criticism by others, to shift the goalposts of what is *allowable* without threat or fear of fines and prison. That represents a far graver threat to a free and open society, than the ignorant rantings of racists and bigots. 

There is plenty wrong with the US, and much that our friends in Europe get right. But here, America has made the right choice: free speech must be truly free, otherwise all speech becomes limited to that which is deemed socially acceptable.

The example of the [Danish cartoons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyllands-Posten_Muhammad_cartoons_controversy) is a perfect one. Can I post them on a website in Canada, or publish them in a magazine, *to discuss their content*, or the effect they had, or make an editorial against the outraged response by the Muslim community? Is there a **probability greater than 0** that I will face a tribunal, court costs, lawyers fees, and possible fines and jail, for doing so, *even if* there was no hatred of Muslims in my intent, nor desire to marginalize the Muslim community at large in Canada? If so, then I am frightened. I have reason to fear speaking, reason to second-guess airing my views, and I know, that even if the possibility of problems is *slim*, it is possibly enough that *I should not speak my mind*. 

If such is the case, then how can it be said I am living in a free and democratic society?

True,1426036288,1252011002,1,"Ah, i realize it has been quite some time since i have said anything and to be honest with you i figured this was long since dead.
But yes, i agree with you on almost all of your points. Learning is great. I am going to university right now and am enjoying it immensely.  Some people tell me i am a nerd but i maintain that you have to study to be a nerd.  I learn things very easily in that i can simply show up to class and retain almost all of what was taught without any further review. Quite handy really. Of course i do go beyond the classroom.  I probably read an average of ten books a month ranging from science to philosophy to fiction and everything in between.

Earning money is one of the things i have to disagree with though.  I find that money can actually ruin happiness.  Having money causes us to want more and more.  Provided that is possible then it may work, but if ever that money was to run out then you would inevitably be less happy as your happiness is based off of those material possessions.  The way i see it, the only way money makes a person happy is the pursuit of it. The pursuit of a goal is indeed much more satisfying than the time after it has been reached.

I wish i could get a intellectually stimulating job.  My job consists of dealing with upset people and angry animals.  Seeing as how i am still in school though i find it complicated to get a truly intellectually stimulating job.

If by ""you might actually have fun once in a while"" you mean to say that i don't have any fun then you are mistaken.  I do indeed have fun very often. Although i suppose you are right that i could have more fun in more situations if i did drink. Never having tried it i cant really say that you are wrong but part of is i know i have the potential to become addicted to it. I know i have the kind of personality that gets addicted to things easily. Probably a stupid reason, but my brother struggles with that, and i have other extended family that struggle with it as well.  Call me paranoid but thats just me.

And lastly i love to travel.  I havent been nearly enough places to say i  have seen the world but i have seen enough to be in love with traveling.  It is just so dang expensive... I am going to iceland next summer with some friends and possibly on to ireland after that.  I would love to travel asia after that but a need at least a few months for that...  I've been to europe and i find i much prefer a culture that is completely foreign to me than over americanized places in europe.  That is i suppose what i am looking for in asia. Will i find it? Probably not entirely, but i can hope.

Finally, believe you me i am looking, but i am still left searching for anyone that thinks even remotely similar to how i think.   I dont require them to think exactly like me, that would be silly.  But i would like to be able to have intelligent conversations.  That would be fantastic.

Anyways again sorry it took so long for me to get back to you and if anyone else who made a comment reads this, i will likely get back to you in the next day or so.

&gt; There are flows from Antwerp to Belgium and Flanders and money flows from the rest of Flanders to Limburg. 

Typical argument which does not make any sense. Antwerp and Limburg are both Flemish and have a lot in common. Flanders and Wallonie have nothing in common. Compare it to family versus strangers. If my sister would be in need of money, I would give it to her immediately. If some perfect stranger would come to me and ask for a large amount of money, I would think twice. Wallonie has pillaged Flanders for 180 years. Not because they were poor and needed it, but just because they could do it.

When we achieve 50% efficiency (we already have 40% in the lab), 1 square kilometer of solar panels (in the right location) will be able to produce 300 megawatts for about 6 hours per day. Luckily, those 6 hours correspond precisely with peak power consumption.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism

as stated above:
Deism is a theological position (though encompassing a wide variety of view-points) concerning God's relationship with the natural world which emerged during the scientific revolution of seventeenth century Europe and came to exert a powerful influence during the eighteenth century enlightenment. By virtue of this, deism as a theological doctrine has had a great influence on the character of the modern world.

Deism holds that God does not intervene with the functioning of the natural world in any way, allowing it to run according to the laws of nature that he configured when he created all things. God is thus conceived to be wholly transcendent and never immanent.

Las familias acaudaladas buscaban crear imitaciones de los balnearios europeos, principalmente de Francia, que vivia su Belle Epoque, lo que se puede observar a traves de la ornamentacion de la galeria vidriada que da hacia Av. Cartagena.
Esta vivienda esta construida mezclando varios estilos arquitectonicos, lo que se conoce con el nombre de arquitectura eclectica que en este caso mezcla caracteristicas de la arquitectura chilena de principios del siglo XX y estilos predominantes en Europa.
Al frente en Av Cartagena Nº501, encontramos a la Casa Castillo Diaz, propiedad adquirida en la primera decada del siglo XX por Osvaldo Castillo, uno de los capitalistas pioneros de Cartagena.
Esta vivienda ademas de servir de veraneo fue ocupada por Carlota Diaz Sagrado, integrante de la familia recordada en el sector por transformar una de las habitaciones en oratorio para que fuese utilizado en ceremonias liturgicas. Esta casa guarda entre sus paredes la intensa vida social que envolvia la rutina de las familias de vereanantes que no solo disfrutaban de las 
bondades del sol, las playas y el mar, sino que tambien de sus lujosas viviendas.
La construccion difiere de otra de su epoca por ser una solida mezcla de concreto , adobe y carecer de una techumbre empinada. Sobresale ademas porque en sus jardines florece una de las palmeras mas antiguas del 
balneario.
Hacia Av. Cartagena presenta un frente simetrico enmarcado por dos torreones que es posible apreciar gracias a un generoso antejardin . Lamentablemente las construcciones se encuentran deterioradas.
Avanzamos por calle Arica hacia el norte y encontramos la calle Crescente Errazuriz, doblamos hacia el poniente , dos cuadras , esquina calle San Antonio, se encuentra Villa Restaurada, esta villa se encuentra aislada en el 
terreno y posee un amplio acceso . Llama la atencion el juego de volumenes en busca de mejores vistas hacia el mar. Ademas , el techo adquiere mayor importancia gracias a su variada forma, lo que acentua la presencia de la vivienda dentro de la ciudad.

I am sorry but I couldn't disagree more. My point was socialism, capitalism, they are economic philosophies. Americans always talk about freedom. I would really like to hear a definition of what this means cause I am not sure. Honestly, I feel like it is just some political buzz word with no true meaning. I mean If i say I represent freedom, people hear well I like being free, ya this is great, but does it really mean anything?? (rhetorical question)

Really (and I am not joking), I am not sure what tAmericans mean when they say they wanna be free. I mean would you consider EU member states free (most have quite social democratic political philosophies), how about Canada, or what about Singapore (often argued as an example of a benevolent dictatorship). Now what about Somalia. A true free market enconomy with no government. You want security, buy protection from the warlords. No taxes, no functioning government, freedom to do whatever you want, as long as you can pay for it. Is that freedom? Or is only the US free? Whatever that means.....

&gt; Under socialism you are your brothers keeper. Society makes a claim on your life. It is a form of Serfdom. You are not property of a sovereign, but instead you are the property of your neighbor. And your neighbor is likewise your property. Because you are bound to each other in responsibility you suddenly have a philosophical stake in the decisions you each make.

Please repeat after me. Socialism DOES NOT equal Communism. Repeat again. They are different ideologies. Socialism understand personal property rights. Generally a socialist rejects the ideas of a class struggle. 

Now I am not anti-capitalist, not a communist, not a socialist. Capitalism is driven by individual choices, with disregard to the greater good of society.I think the free market has its role in certain sectors, but fails in others. In some sectors, such as fire protection, police, military, health, I think the rights of everybody, out way the rights of the individual. Now we have had public fire protection for a long time, so (almost) nobody would argue with me here, why can't other see the similarity when applied to health. 

A Private fire protection system was attempted (see new york in the mid 1800s), it failed miserably, a private health care system is ongoing in the US right now... how is it doing?

I mean please even just check wikipedia. All I ask is people educate themselves about the meaning of words. Words can be a beautiful thing, as long as you understand their meaning..

From Wikipedia:

In general, contemporary social democrats support:

    * A mixed economy consisting of both private enterprise and publicly owned or subsidized programs of education, health care, child care and related social services for all citizens.
    * An extensive system of social security (although usually not to the extent advocated by socialists), with the stated goal of counteracting the effects of poverty and insuring the citizens against loss of income following illness, unemployment or retirement.
    * Government bodies that regulate private enterprise in the interests of workers and consumers by ensuring labor rights (i.e. supporting worker access to trade unions), consumer protections, and fair market competition.
    * Environmentalism and environmental protection laws; for example, funding for alternative energy resources and laws designed to combat global warming.
    * A value-added/progressive taxation system to fund government expenditures.
    * A secular and a socially progressive policy.
    * Immigration and multiculturalism.
    * Fair trade over free trade.
    * A foreign policy supporting the promotion of democracy, the protection of human rights and where possible, effective multilateralism.
    * Advocacy of social justice, human rights, social rights, civil rights and civil liberties.

None of that looks to evil or too stifling of freedom to me......

During new home construction the incremental cost for installation is going to be fairly small, but to upgrade an existing house, they have to provide power for it (old gas water heaters didn't use electricity for anything), a larger gas line, and a much larger exhaust vent for it that can't be combined with things like the furnace or boiler. It could easily cost 1000-3000 bucks to get it installed in an older home. ",t3_9h1xz,c0cr8rd,,True,,,0,technology,False,t5_2qh16,0,t1_c0cr6s2,9,t1_c0cr8rd,surface,0

Freedom is broad in this sense, as it refers to freedom from government regulation, which is often viewed by proponents of *laissez-faire* policies to be a restraint. To name one, I suppose it would include freedom from state intervention in the economy through environmental protections, monopoly preventions, and protectionism.

&gt;Name one EU country that has a socialist policy. Please be specific with an example: Country X passes law Z with which service(or product) Y can only be provided by the state (using civil servants).

I don't believe any European Union country has a Socialist policy or philosophy. 

&gt;...with socialism where the government can prevent the public from competing in the same business. 

Wouldn't a restraint or abridgment when participating in business qualify as an infringement on the free market?

&gt;You see, EU not only wants (and does) to remove laws that may prevent individuals from doing business, it also wants that the state stops wasting tax payers money while playing ""businessman"".

I wouldn't be surprised. Europe is currently going through a massive Conservative revival, with the exception of Iceland, I suppose. 

However, 48 percent of the European Union's budget has been dedicated to agricultural subsidies, price controls, and the buying and selling of excess produce, all by the government, and this only continues to grow in funding, much to the dismay of free marketeers. It's been criticized for artificially inflating prices and circumventing efficient markets. Such a policy is not one I would expect of a free market environment.

The UK, i'm sure, would remake many US shows (or invent their own, removing the need to fill up hours of TV time with american sitcoms and films) but just simply does not have the money. That is also why the 'discrete series of 6 - 12 episodes' exists; it's not a stylistic choice or a dignified stance away from the crassness of 24 episode 'seasons.' there just isn't enough money to go around to fund a suitable number of shows for more than six or twelve episodes. it has become cultural thing at this point, but it was born from economics.

To really see this, take a look at the industry statistics. UK TV is something like 50% straight from the US and Canada - 25% more are joint projects between UK and US production houses – something like 5% - 10% are from other countries. This leaves between 15 - 20% of all UK television to 'British' series. It's all because of the size of the market. The US market has televisions, loves them, and has 319,000,000 people, so has a lot of power.

A good chunk of Europe's social democratic parties were initially even active members of Comintern - the Communist International -, until Stalin got control of it and started tightening the grip. A good chunk of European commmunist parties were actually formed as splinter groups from socialist parties that left Comintern and where the remaining part supported social democracy.

[Most of those social democratic parties are today members of the Socialist International](http://www.socialistinternational.org/viewArticle.cfm?ArticlePageID=931), and they make up the majority of members of the Socialist International though there are members that belong to other reformist socialist ideologies as well.

Many of these parties are explicitly *named* socialist parties - the French Socialist Party for example.

But German MP Hermann Scheer, president of Eurosolar, the European Association for Renewable Energy, called the Desertec project ""highly problematic"".

He said costs would be vastly higher and deadlines would be missed due to logistical problems such as sand storms and dealing with many different countries. ""I would urge the investors to stay clear of it,"" he told The Guardian.

Scheer was also critical of the fact that the project would ""duplicate the current system"" whereby energy distribution is concentrated in the hands of a few multinational companies. ""We should be looking instead at decentralising the system, and looking closer to home for our energy supplies, such as solar panels on homes or harnessing wind energy on the coasts, or inland,"" he said.

&gt;The allowable sulfur content for ULSD (15 ppm) is much lower than the previous U.S. on-highway standard for low sulfur diesel (LSD, 500 ppm), which not only reduces emissions of sulfur compounds (a cause of acid rain), but also allows advanced emission control systems to be fitted that would otherwise be poisoned by these compounds. These systems can greatly reduce emissions of oxides of nitrogen and particulate matter.

&gt;Because this grade of fuel is comparable to European grades and engines will no longer have to be redesigned to cope with higher sulfur content and may use advanced emissions control systems which can be damaged by sulfur, the ULSD standard is increasing the availability of diesel-fueled passenger cars in the U.S.

I was just generalising because we were talking about solid tumours. Saying most of the time it is used with radiotherapy is also a generalisation as these details depend on cancer type and staging.
* It is true that there is a maximum radiation dosage to be applied in a patient. Tumors which don't die with this dosage are known as radio resistant and are not elective for radiotherapy treatment. Unfortunately on many cases the objective of the treatment is not to cure or achieve total remission but to improve life expectancy. The rule of thumb is that you go first with surgery if possible, then Radiotherapy/Chemotherapy or both combined depending on the cancer type. Inmunothrerapy/ hormonotherapy may be added for improved results in some cases but with no miracles. Off course each patient is himself and each cancer is itself so this varies greatly.
* Chemotherapy cannot go on indefinitely as cancers become resistant to chemotherapy if no total remission is achieved. You can change the protocol with mixed results. Normally if on a control TC/PET you don't see tumoural mass reduction the indication is to stop or change protocol. Currently there are undergoing clinical studies to evaluate the risks of maintaining chemotherapy on such patients in order to ""keep a leash"" on the cancer. 
* Recuperate blood from the veins is extremely difficult if not impossible because you'd have to exclude a whole region from circulation and you would loose a great quantity of blood, and you would still have it drain through the lymphatic system. If can exclude a whole region then the way to go is to surgically remove the tumour. 
* I was thinking Angioplasty and a surgeon IS  needed (mater of fact 2) as is an anaesthesiologist and a nursing team. It is a complex procedure which is not without risks.

True,1426036889,1252077652,1,"&gt; I'm saying that Constantine's official acceptance and promotion of Christianity went a long way to making that religion both acceptable and ubiquitous in the Empire and saved it outright in those two ways - spreading it to the germanic chieftains and enshrining it in the eastern empire.

And I wouldn't argue that.

&gt; The fall of Rome should have been a near extinction event for most of their culture, but it wasn't because the invaders were every bit as Christian and there was an eastern bastion still holding out.

This I have a little more difficulty with.  It isn't clear to me, for example, when the Germanic invaders adopted Christianity or why.  In the late 8th and early 9th century, for example, Charlemagne was still fighting off Germanic pagan tribes, and seems to have delivered a fatal blow to medieval paganism with his destruction of an [Irminsul][1] Stadtbergen.  That suggests the possibility that even as late as the turn of the 8th century, Germanic paganism still might have become the dominant religion on the Continent.

But even if the Christian Germanic tribes had lost out to their pagan counterparts in Western Europe, I'm not sure that Christianity would have been thoroughly wiped out.  The Eastern Empire was more thoroughly Christianized that the Western Roman Empire ever managed to be, and was more stable at the collapse of Rome.  Not only that, but there was a flourishing African Christianity across the Mediterrainian.

&gt; I'm not saying there was a monopoly in Constantine's time, but that decisions he made led directly TO a monopoly in later years.

Or, at least, near enough to a monopoly, sure.  I haven't disputed that.  And so long as that's as far as you intend to take the argument, I have no objection.  But it doesn't follow that Christianity requires a monopoly in order to survive.

Yes, because we haven't cut enough of the rain forest down already.

In just over 23 years there will be 2 billion people starving, in 56 years 4 billion and in 79 years a grand total of 8 billion people will be starving, more than the current world population. Of course this is assuming that the people who can feed themselves right now will continue to do so and won't be affected by all those that are starving. 

Now on the other hand the US and European population growth is less than 1%, in fact some of those European countries are shrinking in population. Let's assume a ""best case"" scenario and say they're all increasing by 1%, it would 70 years to double our population.

Truthfully, its rather unlikely that 95% of the world's population will need much beyond their local language and a regional lingua franca. For the Americas learning English and Spanish will allow you to communicate with 85% of the native languages of the speakers. If you feel like tackling Brazilian Portuguese you'll probably be able to up that number to 99% of the population.

Beyond that my only experience is with East Asia. There, they have an interesting history where just about every nation used Chinese characters at one point or another. Japanese to this day uses Chinese characters even though they have a syllabary-type alphabet that could theoretically be used for all writing. Korean writing is the same way; they use it in their writing in a similar way a English writer would use ""their, they're and there"", to differentiate homonyms and add some formality to the written language. 

I don't really think everyone in the world learning English or some other lingua franca will help global affairs because of the dramatic increase in loanwords that native English speakers will have to learn to keep up with some of the untranslatable concepts / words that one encounters, not to mention that most people throughout the world have a very limited ability to travel and meet people from around the world and thus exercise their language skills. For instance, in the United States we can drive from coast to coast, north to south and expect to be able to speak English to almost everyone. This is a fluke; In Europe one can travel a few hundred miles and transition from French to German and then to Polish. In China, some localities that are seperated only by 20-30 miles have spoken languages that are completely foreign to one another (generally mislabeled as ""dialects"").

No, you've misunderstood: I do not claim that forming any opinion other than 'all religions are equally absurd' is ignorance.  Unlike the louder atheists, I do in fact respect your, and other, religious beliefs.

I can certainly see this happening, and it will undoubtedly be a challenge for teachers.  But at the root, the problem is conflict, especially conflict personally relevant to the kids and teachers involved, and that is not at all unique to religion.

Some Muslim women wear no head covering at all, some wear a scarf, some cover their face. I can't speak for France, but in America, those that cover anything at all are more likely the product of individual choice than not. 

Also, to say this is a practice rooted in male ownership of women is absurb. First, many of these women are not married and the rule is the same. Second, up until recently, within the last 150 years or so, many European women were owned by their husbands as a matter of law when that has not been the case in Arabian societies for about 1400 years. The idea that beauty and sexuality belongs to a marital relationship and not in the public space is not the same thing as ownership. I wonder if this isn't a European overreaction to their own more recent oppressive laws towards women. 

Also, I take much more offense to the supposedly modern idea of stripping women down for the enjoyment of men. It's a much more insidious kind of patriarchy.

Israel even beg the world to be sympathetic toward the victims souls of Holocausts.

It was later proven by the advanced state of decomposition of the bodies that the murders had happened weeks earlier--before the Nazi invasion. This conclusion was arrived at in the 1960s.The earlier claim that it was a reaction to the Nazi invasion was debunked. It was THAT claim that was the propaganda.It was NOT a reaction. The forensic decomposition of the bodies proved it.
 And your sources are ? ” It was later proven, the conclusion was arrived by” who? where?  Again you are unable to provide any evidence or reliable sources to back up your claims.  
„In reality, the Poles were conducting ethnic cleansings and HAD been for centuries before Hitler was even born.” 
Oh  Really? You mean ethnic cleansing as in imprisoning, expelling or killing of members of an ethnic minority by a dominant majority to achieve ethnic homogeneity. Would you care to specify who were Poles conducting ethnic cleansing against for centuries? 
„Try Jochen Bohler. Or Michael Burleigh. Or David Curp's ""A Clean Sweep: The Politics of Ethnic Cleansing"". But oops. I guess they don't exist either, huh?”
1. Jochen Bohler  - works in German History Institute in Warsaw, Most famous work Auftakt zum Vernichtungskrieg. Die Wehrmacht in Polen 1939  - Wehrmacht crimes in Poland has a nice section on German atrocities in Bydgoszcz/Bromberg I suggest you read it, or even better e-mail the author to see if agrees with your Nazi ideology. 
2. Michael Burleigh – don’t know his work, but will look  into it, I haven’t found any information about his work containing any mention of Polish ethnic cleansing against Germans prior to WWII.  Probably because the author is a historian and not a science fiction writer. In one of the reviews of his work I found this sentence though:  „The author is also very strong in his discussion of the occupation of various parts of Europe and how Nazi policies differed from country to country. He reveals the extent to which the occupied countries engaged in their own ethnic housecleaning once the Nazi invasion undermined their stability.” So you might be onto something here but again you don’t really know what you are talking about, you confuse facts, historical eras etc.  
3. David Curp   The Politics of Ethnic Cleansing in Western Poland, 1945 – 1960 how convenient of you to leave out the last part of the title.  
You need to make up your mind, first you start with 1918 – 1919, I check your bullshit claims then  you come up with a fake Bromberg story than you haven’t even researched.  Than you ramble something about pogroms and supposed centuries of  ethnic cleansing to finally arrive at post war expulsion/flight of German population from Pomerania, Eastern Prussia and Silesia.  
„I'm pointing to events that happened before Hitler, and it's pissing you off.” Your not pointing to shit.  The only thing you have pointed to so far is that you sympathize with Germans, think that WWII and attack on Poland was justified, and that you  know almost next to nothing about Polish/German history.  Let’s end this thing  here.   I’ll leave with your pathetic anti Slavic prejudice and a link that may hopefully enlighten your closed minded attitudes.

That's ridiculous. It's like saying you cannot be British-Scottish just because certain Scots wish independence from the UK. You cannot be English-Scottish, but _being Scottish implies being British whether you like it or not_. It's just a simple fact of life, like being French makes you European. This has nothing to do with independence or nationalism.

Whether Catalonia should be independent from the rest of Spain is a perfectly legitimate debate. However, believing Catalonia and Spain are two different entities shows little understanding of Spanish history. You, like many Catalan and Basque nationalists, seem to confuse Spain -the aggregate of Castille, Aragon (which included Catalonia) and Navarre- with Castille itself, which became the dominant kingdom in the union. This is on par with confusing England with the UK. You cannot be Castillian-Catalan. However, whether you are Castillian or Catalan, you are Spanish.

I insist, this has nothing to do with nationalism.

The same is true of Africa; southern Africa is the only region that has a significant European population because it is the only region where European-style agriculture works.  

All of which is just to say that it looks like climate is by far the much more important determining factor with regard to the fate of native populations vs their colonizers.  In the case of Latin America, the Iberians were mostly interested in resource extraction (gold and silver) whereas in North America where European-style agriculture worked, there was land that could be colonized and settled.  It's actually much more complicated than that, but Reddit isn't really the place for an in-depth discussion of it.

&gt;people have a hard time imagining the public option

I guess it really is hard to imagine. For some reason 'public' and 'social' have bad reputations in spite of both being proven superior to 'free market'. Same as there is this strange perception that Democrats are less economic responsible in spite of it being the Republicans who have persistently and systematically squandered the valuables and the Democrats cleaning up after them.

I just don't get it that those misperceptions seem to live on.

Anyway, I live in Europe with public health care which means I can choose the doctor I want (have had the same for over 20 years) I can visit a specialist if I need it. I usually talk it over with my doctor first who then recommends a suitable specialist. That's it. Of course, I pay over the taxes but I really don't think about it as it is just one of those things. The benefit is that I never think about my health in terms of economic ruin or in terms of economy at all for that matter.

The main purpose of articles like the one you cited are to start discussions over these issues.  The relation to Euthanasia programs/social Darwinism is pretty far fetched.

While the term has been applied to the claim that Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection can be used to understand the social endurance of a nation or country, social Darwinism commonly refers to ideas that predate Darwin's publication of On the Origin of Species. Others whose ideas are given the label include the 18th century clergyman Thomas Malthus, and Darwin's cousin Francis Galton who founded eugenics towards the end of the 19th century.

Essentially, this bill is going to require every American to purchase a private insurance plan with their own money. If you can’t afford this private insurance, then you will be “taxed” or fined by the government (Title IV, P.167).

Section 1162 indicates that the government will mandate what it calls “outcome based measures,” which is a polite way of saying rationing (Section 1162, P.335).

Former Senator Tom Daschle, also a former Obama nominee for the position of Health and Human Services Secretary, actually wrote many of these provisions (McCaughey). Daschle is quoted in his book as saying that Americans expect too much from their healthcare system and that Europeans should be commended for being more willing to accepting “hopeless diagnoses” and foregoing “experimental treatments (McCaughey). He also goes on to say that seniors should be more accepting of these hopeless diagnoses and illnesses that come with age instead of treating them (McCaughey).

Subpart XII, Section 340L which establishes a “Corps” that will conduct “Home Healthcare visits” as explained in Section 1713 to assess the designated families’ “economic self-sufficiency, employment, school readiness, and educational achievement” and to coach them on how to raise their children(Section 1713,P.768). This bill does in fact contain provisions that would set the wages of doctors (Section 225 and Section 223), possibilities of a draft to a National Health Service Corps (as mention also in the stimulus bill; section 1713), creation of a National Medical Device Registry(Section 2521), and potential to mandate even the food we eat (Section 3121).

trade secrets are only good for things that aren't easily reverse engineered. things like recipes. by essentially placing an additional requirement that all new ideas, in order to be profitable, be difficult to reverse engineer, you run the risk of stifling innovation.

&gt;A woman does just as much, if not more, to ""create"" a child as a human does to ""create"" a new idea, does this entail a right of the woman to claim ownership over the child? Perhaps you believe that children are fundamentally different than ideas in a way relevant here, and thus they are exempt where ideas are not. If so, I would grant you that much, but only after noting that being responsible for the creation of a given thing does not necessarily constitute a claim for dominion, since we already know of exceptions.

The woman creating the child could even fall into the system I have laid out, but the child would be an unprotectable form of new information since every member of the human race essentially has the same capability to create children, and because creating children will happen even in the presence of rules forbidding their creation. It actually might be useful to think of ideas as being analogous to children, though, in the sense that there are certain things you allow children to do and there are certain things you tell them they are not allowed to do. In fact, I'm sure many inventors and scientists have thought of their ideas as children. In 20 years, the children grow up and anyone can use them for anything.

&gt;What if you ""create"" such an idea and exert your control over it by refusing to share it? Then, years later, someone else ""creates"" the exact same idea, but does share it, being rewarded in the process. Given that you seem to think you have absolute dominion over your own creation, do you have a just claim to the exact same idea created independently by this second party? If not, what if you had written it in a diary, or sent it to yourself sealed in the mail but never shared it, so that your originality was unquestioned. Would this circumstance give you claim to dominion over the idea?

I think I addressed this point, but I will elaborate again here. In such cases that ideas are independently arrived at, but the idea is still sufficiently complex as to suggest that only a few members of a large set of population might independently arrive at it, the idea essentially falls between the two models I laid out (ideas are invented vs. ideas are discovered), and the system of resolution for this special case currently is ""first to invent"". In Europe and other countries, rights are given to the ""first to file"". (I could have this backwards, but the point is that a system of resolution for such a case already exists).

As for obviousness of patents, here is how that works (I didn't write this):
A patent is obvious if what is claimed is novel (see previous question), but the novel aspects were not the result of any inventive activity. For example, the claimed invention has one element that does not occur in a first prior art document, but it is common general knowledge that that one element could be added. Generally, it is required to show some kind of hint towards adding that element, or modifying an existing element, before that adding or modifying is considered obvious.

The main problem with obviousness is that you very easily reason with the benefit of hindsight. This is not permitted. You must base your arguments entirely on the prior art, without knowledge of the invention. With hindsight, it is almost always possible to present a series of modifications to a prior art system that result in the claimed invention.

As for ideas existing before they enter the minds of humans: the argument has been made many times and much more elegantly than I can make it here. Here's a quick article about the very subject: http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2008/04/is-mathematics.html

I would also argue that ownership of ideas is deeply embedded in many cultures as evidenced by the names of many elements, phenomena, formulas, and principles. Not only is it like that in our culture, but many other cultures, sufficiently complex, have this feature of associating people and their ideas with one another.

I have tried to be impartial, but ultimately I know I cannot be. My grandfather, uncle, father, and brother are all researchers for a living, in both the public and private sector (physics, electrical engineering, mechanical and aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, respectively). Patents protect their work and earn them money. I have no financial incentive to give up this system. ",t3_9guzb,c0csma0,,False,,,0,technology,False,t5_2qh16,0,t1_c0csht8,1,t1_c0csma0,[deleted],0

|""And I have to ask: how does every other industrialized country do this and yet financial Armageddon does not seem to strike them down?""

I feel like many many European countries, have very successful public healthcare systems but I'm hesitant to assert that the same formula can be applied to the United States. Many European states have populations that are more homogeneous, in both income and ethnicity, where a universal system might work more appropriately. I haven't researched this thoroughly but it's definitely worth looking into once I have some time.

|Now if a third world country can do it, why can't the US?

I would have to question what kind of care the third world country's government is capable of providing. Unfortunately, many African governments are struggling with providing the level of care to the population that we consider basic. For instance, the diseases that  developing countries are facing, such as cholera, malaria, dysentery to name a few, vary strongly from the major diseases that developed countries face such as heart disease, cancer, obesity, and unfortunately medical error (9th highest cause of death if i remember correctly).

I've read about some measures that could be taken to reduce the amount of entitlement expenditures in the long term. Most of these will be political suicide:
1) Increase the age which one receives entitlements because people are living longer nowadays.
2) Remove medicare/medicaid benefits from those with sufficient resources.
3) Reduce science funding for new techniques because the new treatments cost the most money.

Finally, to me, it seems that by simply offering a public option of healthcare and not changing the underlying system, the government is merely shoving loads of money on top of a system that does not give us the most bang for the buck. Change, by virtue of the system and democratic process, is slow in America but I would support universal healthcare if it allows the government to improve the healthcare system  with more ease in the future.

So I've laid out a bunch of reasons why universal might not work. What do you think we could do to the current system to make it more efficient?

True,1426037565,1252135047,6,"This is a really good question.  And there are many topics I can think of.  People like to convince themselves that there is a ""One True Way"" (TM) to health and fitness and this is very likely to be untrue.  At the highest level, I would say that the French paradox represents a great problem for modern health and fitness understanding.  The French eat fatty and unhealthy food and have a generally low incidence of heart disease and are the thinnest people in Europe to boot (however even that paradox is now being called into question).  The Eskimo-diet represents another highly controversial issue for modern health advice.

I tend to distrust anything health or fitness related being sold to me.  Humans did not evolve to eat extracted this and purified that.  Nor is it reasonable to suggest that we should eat exactly this many eggs and that many tomatoes each week.

In analysing what is good or bad for human health, it is probably sensible to look to the past.  How did humans evolve to live?  What are the optimal conditions for the human body, both in terms of diet and energy expenditure?  These are sensible questions to ask when evaluating health ""truths"".  It is likely that most of the controversial issues you've raised above are half-truths.  These are all basic science questions, all were conditions early man had to deal with (except perhaps vegetable oil), and all are likely to have specific genetic adaptations in man to deal with them.  Be wary of anything controvertial on either side.

Cholesterol bad?  I very much doubt it.  Mankind evolved to eat meat (not solely, we are omnivores after all).  He followed his prey and did this for several million years.  No, it is simply very unlikely that it is as simple as ""Cholesterol bad"".  It is far more likely to be ""Cholesterol beneficial in low doses, bad in high doses"".  Even there, this has exceptions.  Eskimos eat huge quantities of fat to virtually no apparent ill-affect.  There must be some specific adaptation in the human genome to allow such a diet to work.  It is just downright naive to believe that the answer to Cholesterol is simply good or bad.

We like to look for simple answers to complex questions.  The answer to living a healthy, strong, and energetic life would be so much simpler if we could just boil it down to a set of simple rules that we can follow like automatons.  Unfortunately, we not automatons.  We have to adapt, survive, deal with disease, our environment, circumstance.  All these things interfere with just picking some idealised set of rules we can all just blithely follow.  I say let's be sensible.  Let's eat lower on the food chain.  Eat raw food.  Eat in sensible proportions.  Remember that man adapted to survive with famine better than feast!  Then we can hope find the healthy, fit, and long life rules that we should follow.  Anything else is just wishful thinking.

Britannica Encyclopedia:
&gt;Skinhead - n. Slang. - Member of an international youth subculture characterized by hair and dress styles evoking aggression and physical toughness. Typical skinhead style includes shaved heads, combat boots, tattoos, and prominent body piercings. Skinheads first appeared in working-class areas of London in the 1960s; during the 1970s and '80s the skinhead phenomenon spread to Australia, North America, and western Europe. In many countries, skinheads are regarded as extreme right-wing nationalists who espouse anti-Semitic and other racist views and engage in violent attacks on immigrants and racial minorities. This characterization, however, does not apply to all members of the subculture.

&gt;Many of them were soon drawn into extreme nationalist, and especially anti-immigrant, groups. Some skinheads were recruited as “storm troopers” for neo-Nazi organizations, and the movement became increasingly politicized. Skinhead gangs often attacked immigrants or racial minorities, particularly Turks and Asians in Germany and Indians and Pakistanis in Britain.

USA: They have guns, tazers and all sorts of nasty shit! Crazy stuff. far to many rumours about corruption and brutality for it to not be true. Definitely a 0.4 on the scale

The PDF file presents a 175-paged document entitled ""What ambitions for Europeans defence in 2020?"". It was produced by the EU Institute for Security Studies, an EU funded policy think-tank. The paper deals with security strategy for the EU in 2020, and concentrates on the problems of ""hierarchical class society"", with the ""elite"" of the world on one side, and the so-called ""bottom billion"" on the other. To avoid ""global systemic collapse"" the paper suggests that the ""full spectrum of high intensity combat"" to be used to protect what is called ""globalisers"" from ""localisers"". Localisers, making up 80% of the world population, include the ""bottom billion"", states in the Middle East and the so-called ""Alienated Modern States"" like North Korea. Globalisers, notably, include not only members of the OECD and ""Rapid Transition Societies"" like China and Brasil, but also ""Transnational Corporations""—the ""Fortune Global 1000"".

In that context the paper elaborates on ""barrier operations shielding the global rich from the tensions and problems of the poor"". It reads that ""as the ratio of the world population living in misery and frustration will remain massive, the tensions and spillover between their world and that of the rich will continue to grow.

True,1426037628,1252148017,1,"&gt;I know that this system works in some countries (though many still debate that).

I would say that the system works, in that it delivers health care efficiently and effectively (I live in such a country) but there is always the argument from a minority that more private involvement, or less regulation would make health care cheaper and more efficient, something not easily verifiable (because wherever it is is both private and deregulated it tends to be worse).  So whilst I agree that there is a debate, I don't think it is one about delivering health care, but rather one about the market.

&gt;I really think the culture (for better or worse) in america is such that it is a completely unsustainable solution.

This however is the key.  I think there is too much opposition internally and that the US government has an abysmal record when it comes to legislation favouring large business interests. I wouldn't be surprised if any public health option actually benefited the current health providers and made health care more expensive to the average American.  Of course hopefully that would come with some benefit to the currently uninsured, but obviously it is not ideal.  The US seems too large, incompetent and morally divergent to be able to succeed in this, if anything the federal government should probably mandate that the states each deal with this, rather than trying to do something grand like a medicare on steroids type solution.

&gt;I advocate major reform, but not government intervention.

I would agree with you.  Reform of the private sector through legislation but without subsidy would probably be the best solution for the US given what the US is like.  Nationalisation would be preferable, but frankly the US couldn't afford it. I don't think the end result will be anything close to as good as say the health systems in Germany or the UK, but at least it may be less inequitable and provide some benefits.

&gt;IMO, we should go back to basics and many doctors are. They are refusing all types of insurance and taking cash. They also take the decision making power back doing this way with regards to patient outcomes and care as well as charity.

This I tend to disagree with.  People like to hark back to simpler times, when doctors were paid for what they did, charities took care of the poor and all was rosy.  In reality of course most people, the vast majority, had no access to any health care at all.  They certainly couldn't afford surgeons (unless they were rich), nor anything beyond simple medicines.  The decisions should of course go back to the patient (in fact even living in the UK it seems bizarre that clinical decisions could be questioned by anyone other than the patient...) rather than be taken on the basis of cost.

I think my earlier statement about need was probably the clearest, so I will elaborate a little on it.  I think that in the UK and Europe, people generally feel that the state should, can and is capable of looking after people and running welfare systems.  Sure people think parts of it are abused and get upset about fraudsters and stories about people abusing the system.  Once in a while people demand payments for certain things are reduced (usually after a story about something outrageous). Yet generally they are for the social safety nets in place, in fact if you discuss numbers with people they tend to get horrified at how little the state provides.  In short people are happy to have their taxes go to people in need, when it is done efficiently and those in need really are, in need (with a small margin of error). The US on the other hand seems to have an utterly self focused mentality of 'why should I pay for...' a kind of unsympathetic selfishness that seems so destructive.  Especially given that with insurance they are already paying for others treatments (albeit only other people who can afford to pay!) and their taxes go into many socially beneficial or general expenditures that they may not benefit from directly.

In any case, I will leave it there, although I might just add that from a political perspective, and ignoring the human impact for a moment, I suppose I should probably see the US's lack of certain social systems and a decent health system as an advantage for the UK.  The US presumably loses rather a lot of man hours through its lack of provision and loses members of its society that could have benefited the US.  It presumably also makes it more expensive for US companies to do business (and is a driver pushing US businesses out of the US).

Let me try to answer your questions:

&gt; **Why do you guys travel so much when your own country is so awesome?**

I live 10 minutes from the german border, and yet I can reach the other side of the country in under two hours (by car). I guess that makes it easy to travel outside the borders. Another cause for traveling is that it's very common for (soon-to-be) students to take a year off to go abroad. And then there is study and work abroad. I guess we're a very rich country (on a global scale) which makes it easier to travel.



&gt; **Who do you dislike the most, the French, the Germans, or the English?**

Pfff, this is very personal, I guess. Older people tend to dislike the Germans, since the Nazis invaded our country 70 years ago. All of my grandparents were children during the war, my father's father even has a big dent in his back from a German grenade shell.

Ages ago, we were occupied by the French. Napoleon is the one who forced us to have last names, but I don't think anyone remembers.

And then the English: we thank them for giving us Monty Python, The Beatles and of course London girls.
I myself don't dislike any of my fellow Europeans, except Italians that refuse to speak English when here. 
I love German girls for their open-minded and free way of living and thinking, and for being hot. I love French girls for their cigarettes, clothes, wine and for being hot. And I like English girls for speaking English and for being hot (if from London).



&gt; **Do you wear something orange every day?**

According to Anthony Burgess I have orange skin, but it looks more link light pink-brown to me. 

It's just not my color, I only wear it during a soccer tournament to support my country. And I really like Hugo Boss' 'orange' label :) By the way, did you know that Hugo Boss designed some Nazi costumes?

I sometimes dream about the west of our country fleeing the water by coming to my city and squatting in my house.

When I was young (15 years ago), part of my city stood under water because of rains in Germany - the river that runs through my city overflowed. My local government now has decided to make river deeper and wider, and also reserve some ground to let the river flow through if a similar situation ever happens again.

There is a great Dutch children's book that plays in the future, when there is nothing much left of my country. People live underground, because there wasn't enough space above ground. There are clones and super fast cars, and people don't eat meat anymore. And they pay with a ring around their finger, instead of cash or credit cards. Oh, and communication is wireless. Awesome!

Haha, yes! You have no idea what it is like to learn that as a child. I couldn't believe it: we traded that great city we see on TV every day for Suriname. 

&gt; **Do you ever get tired of walking around in wooden shoes?**

True,1426037724,1252157585,0,"&gt; As for the idea of moral equivalence between the history of Nazi Germany and of the Soviet Union as a whole, that should have been laid to rest by the way in which the Soviet Union withdrew peacefully from Eastern Europe after 1989, and then imploded itself — remarkably peacefully for such a huge state. This is not something that one can imagine Nazi Germany doing.

This quote from the article pretty much brings up the Soviet Union in the late 1980s as an example, then compares it to Nazi Germany during wartime. I'd call this disingenuous at best... drawing a comparison between the two as a whole is really quite hard (unless you're going for something like body counts during the totality of their existence, but in the end that really won't tell you much), and of course a country which managed to survive until its power began waning was going to behave quite differently when in a less advantageous position. What's more, one of the main reasons that the Soviets let Poland and then much of Eastern Europe go during the late 80s/early 90s period was that the USSR lacked the resources to hold the territory (economic and military)... it had just finished a nasty war in Afghanistan, in which it killed several million Afghans over the course of a decade or so, much of the Red Army was still in the region, and there were potential problems in satellite states closer to home to boot.

As for the Katyn Massacre, it was hardly the only example of Soviets murdering or imprisoning Poles. A great many Poles in what's now the Ukraine (pre-war borders were somewhat different, with Poland having more territory out east) were murdered or deported after the USSR's great pushback of the Nazis, and many more during the Red Army's ""liberation"" of the country, to say nothing of what came after power was consolidated by the Communists. Luckily, Stalin died pretty soon after, before he could get all purge-happy again. (his own incompetence and paranoia managed to rob Russia itself of a hell of a lot of military talent just before the start of WW2, ironically) As for how many lives Russian occupation saved, we'll never know. I certainly do give the USSR credit for beating back the Germans in the east (although what they did to their own people to do so was atrocious), but I'm hardly going to look upon it as a blessing in disguise, given their ruining the majority of the countries they occupied afterwards, for some forty odd years. 

As for the inaction of the west, you're pretty much on target there. The majority of Poles of that generation loathe Winston Churchill for precisely this reason.",t3_9hed0,c0ct2ct,,False,,,0,worldnews,False,t5_2qh13,0,t1_c0csswe,0,t1_c0ct2ct,Jambi,0
True,1426037726,1252157743,3,"Wow, tough question.  

PROS - By European standards, Americans have a high standard of living.  

1. Single-family homes with lawns are the norm, even for the working class.  One bathroom per person is common.
2. Most families have 1 car per adult.  
3. Consumer goods are available cheaply and in huge quantities.  
4. Food is cheap and plentiful.  
5. Taxes are low.  
6. Bureaucracy is minimal.

CONS - By European standards, Americans have a low standard of living.

1. Violent crime is a big problem.  Firearms are plentiful and easy to get.  
2. Public schools are poorly funded and run.  In many locales, a private school is essentially mandatory.
3. Health care can only be had with private insurance, which is generally paid for by one's employer.  Unfortunately, many employers do not provide insurance.
4. The average American is religious and provincial. 
5. Most places in America are fully car-dependent.  You will *need* a car, and will have to drive children everywhere.  All these cars result in huge areas given up to roads, and, in larger cities, terrible traffic.
6. The cheap, plentiful food is of inferior quality (think white bread and potato chips).  
7. The cheap, plentiful consumer goods are of inferior quality (mass-produced in China).  

People with education and jobs live very well in the US.  Poor people do much worse than their European counterparts.  The US has a huge gap between the top and bottom incomes; in many ways, it is like a Third World country.  Obviously it is better to be on the high end of the income scale.

You're told to do whatever you can think of with it, and the most creative submissions, combined with a solid application (grades, extra-curriculars, test scores), get major dough.

I applied in 2002.  What I did was write a short story of about 40 paragraphs.  It was about one of those Japanese officers in WWII on a remote island who thought the war was still on.  I placed a Japanese officer in the middle of a remote Pacific island with four towns representing major players in the Cold War (USSR, China, Europe, USA).  He lived in the wilderness around those villages and foraged.  Each town reacted to him in ways analogous to their foreign policies.  (China left him alone and focused on internal matters, for instance.)

I bought a large book of heavy paper.  I transcribed the story by hand, a paragraph per page.  Each paragraph began with an illustration in the box.  Each illustration was a picture representing the first letter of the paragraph and showing something that happened in the paragraph.

In a capitalistic system, by definition, the more money you have, the more money you make. This is because of the way interest and economies of scale work. So, by definition, capital will concentrate in a capitalistic system. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. This system eventually has to lead to a tyranny or dictatorship.

Socialism is what brings balance. Indeed, it means that the means of production and distribution are controlled by ""the state"". To some degree. (By the way, ""the state"" consists of democratically elected people).

The market forces of supply and demand apply everywhere, regardless of the economic and political system. This means that ""full"" socialism is impossible. Every system has to reckon with the market forces, because they are like a law of physics, you can't undo them.

Socialism balances the market forces in such a way that not just the super rich (old money and corporations) benefit from economic activity. Everyone works for it, why shouldn't everyone profit?

Countries with the highest standards of living are the countries that use socialism to balance the market forces (mostly Western European countries and Scandinavia).

True,1426037859,1252174893,1,"I think most people  completely miss the real reason WWII was such a great economic stimulus which lead to some of the most prosperous decades ever in America.

Industrial production and capacity went through the roof during WWII in the US, and there was also a fair bit of technological development.  This put everyone back to work, but since it was funded by deficits it would have been a temporary stimulus that would disappear after the war.

However, North Americans have been incredibly lucky in that absolutely no fighting occured on home territory in either World War.  So, all North American industry, infrastructure, agriculture and real estate was in great shape after the war, while the rest of the developed (and much of the undeveloped e.g. China) world was completely devestated.  All the major countries in Europe as well as Japan were largely destroyed, which was really the great economic boost for America.  This huge foreign demand was a lifesaver as the overcapacity from the war years could mostly be directed towards making exports, with the rapidly growing consumption of Americans sucking up the rest.

Imagine yourself as a massive, resource rich country, with no war damage, in a world where all other countries have been devestated.  Everyone wants to, and needs to buy your goods, for both consumption and the massive rebuilding effort.  It doesn't even matter if you aren't producing them that efficiently or in good quality, there are no alternatives.  And thus after the war American business was able to sell abroad and at home with almost no competition, and then is it really any wonder that prosperity followed?  Detroit was still making pure shit like it is today, but if you wanted a car, you didn't exactly have much choice.  That's the kind of business environment any moron can succeed in.  (And before anyone claims I am just buying the better marketing of foreign manufacturers, no, I use to drive imports my whole life until my current car, which is a new Chevy.  Piece of shit started rusting in multiple places before the first year, even after I got it 'rust proofed'.  Never buying American again.)

I try to watch dubs to get an idea of what they're like when I'm introducing friends to anime series I've enjoyed.  My complaint against dubs is when unrelated traits get introduced to the voices.

I was displeased by the casting of Alphonse (Aaron Dismuke) in the English dub of Full Metal Alchemist (original series).

He is the second main voice role but instead of sounding like a giant suit of armor with a very sympathetic character, they made it sound as if he had a southern twang and lacked all sense of the tragic experience he had when he lost his human body.

The setting of the story is similar to Europe during the industrial revolution.  I admit the Japanese aren't always 100% historically/culturally accurate, but their choice of adding wrong Japanese dialects (Kansai in a futuristic story where the character is an android for example) is slightly less obvious to my American ears.

But when I can detect cliché Western accents that don't match the character, I get annoyed quickly.

It's like trying to watch The Dark Knight when Batman's voice doesn't match.

But if you were sincere you would have to acknowledge the other purposes, to grab more land and cut Palestinians off from each other.

You are being attacked for your one sided blinkered attitude.
the intitives for peace lie within Israels remit.   

I'll repost what see as the situation.

Israel is the regional power. It is the big mean dog, it has all that it wants, the land, military dominance over all its neighbors, trade, the coverage of the worlds only super power. Therefore Israel wants to maintain the current power status quo as is. Israel wants to impose its will on a defeated people and call this peace Those who rule others always want that kind of peace.

I dont expect everyone, particularly you, to agree with the Palestinian POV but at least to understand it.

Palestinians do not place the same premium on peace the Israelis do. This is because they have very little. They have issues that need addressing, the right of return, the occupation of the West Bank, the annexation of Jerusalem, the economic shut down, the total control and blockade of their areas. They see peace as surrender. This is why they keep firing rockets and launching suicide attack. They want justice. The ruled always do.

To get Peace the Israelis have to address issues they simply do not want to. Until Israel is prepared to do that, there will not be peace.

It can be done, The UK showed the way when it talked to the IRA with no pre-condtions. No, ""edit the United Ireland part of your charter"" before we talk. The commander of the Londonderry IRA is now a UK member of parliament and Northern Ireland is still a part of the UK. By talking to the extremists, you fractionalise them, those that want peace, and those that want to fight. To strengthen the hand of those that want peace serious concessions have to be made, when those that want to derail the peace talks strike with rocket attacks and car bombs you have to be very careful with retaliation. Its a long slow road, but there was a time when Northern Ireland looked as hopeless as Palestine, but look at it now.

The PLO was willing to change its charter and recognize Israel, didn't get them anywhere...

The solution to the problems obvious. All the peace plans are essentially the same. Clinton's Peace Plan, the Nusseiba-Ayalon Plan, the Saudi Peace Initiative, Bush’s Road Map, Oslo, Taba summit are all similar

They all include clear measures that Israel has to take in order to make peace:

1.Dismantle the settlements.  
2.Withdraw its soldiers and civilians from the occupied territories,  
3.Allow the creation a viable Palestinian state.      
4.find a solution for the Palestinian refugees' right of return. A massive compensation package?  
5.Find a way to guarantee Israeli security. Altho' I believe having nuke addresses that.  
6.A creative way to reward Israel for giving up what it feels it has won in war.

The problem is Israel will not to go along with these plans. At some point the talks will fail. Developing new plans is a waste of time. Israel wants land, specifically the West Bank. Israel has not dismantled a single settlement built there, and has never ceased to take Palestinian lands under the guise of security. This is the underlying tactic. The aim is to create a ""reality on the ground"" where it become impossible to uproot 100,000's of settlers. The Palestinians will become a servant population within this greater Israel ruled by a compliant Palestinian authority.  

My greatest insight occurred while living in Israel.
I came to realize Israel is a typical colonialist project.

And there are certain things that have happened, such as the nationalization of a portion of the car industry, and a portion of the medical insurance industry (well, proposed), that qualifies as socialistic - the government actually owns the means of production (or would) in these cases. And there are many things the federal government already does that are socialistic (such as ownership of the post office and amtrak).

From another perspective, you'd have to conclude that in many ways, even the industries that are privately owned but subject to rigorous intervention are ""socialist"" because when government interferes with, consolidates, regulates, mandates, and controls business you can only conclude that these actors are fundamentally arms of the state and not at all individuals acting voluntarily - that is, they are not ""private"" in any sense that retains any meaning.

It is unfortunate that many leftists are so uncritical as to accept this premise as indicating that all forms of capitalism are bad, so that full state ownership is the only alternative.""*

Now, another way to look at it is by government spending as a percentage of GDP, which is now about 45%. If we go by this statistic, that would tend to be in the socialistic range - the US is above many ""european socialist"" countries.

Ludwig Von Mises famously said (paraphrasing) ""It is either the government or the market. There is no third way.""

I agree with his analysis - in the broadest perspective - either goods or services are provided by a coercive government monopoly - or they are created and transacted by free individuals.

Also in Europe, some manufacturers have conducted advance studies using a so-called “mock-up” vaccine.

Such advance studies can greatly expedite regulatory approval.

Safety of pandemic vaccines
Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 briefing note 6

6 AUGUST 2009 | GENEVA -- WHO is aware of some media reports that have expressed concern about the safety of vaccines for pandemic influenza. The public needs to be reassured that regulatory procedures in place for the licensing of pandemic vaccines, including procedures for expediting regulatory approval, are rigorous and do not compromise safety or quality controls.

Vaccines are among the most important medical interventions for reducing illness and deaths during a pandemic. However, to have the greatest impact, pandemic vaccines need to be available quickly and in large quantities.

Pandemic influenza vaccine manufacturing process and timeline
6 August 2009

During the 1957 and 1968 pandemics, vaccines arrived too late to be used as an effective mitigation tool during the more severe phases of the pandemics. Influenza vaccines had not yet been developed when the 1918 pandemic swept around the world, eventually killing an estimated 50 million people.

In 2007, as part of preparedness for an influenza pandemic, WHO worked together with health officials, regulatory authorities, and vaccine manufacturers to explore a broad range of issues surrounding the regulatory approval of pandemic vaccines. [1]

Ways were sought to shorten the time between the emergence of a pandemic virus and the availability of safe and effective vaccines. Different regulatory pathways were assessed, and precautions needed to ensure quality, safety, and effectiveness were set out in detail.
Fast-track procedures for approval

Regulatory authorities have shown great flexibility in developing procedures for fast-tracking the approval and licensing of pandemic vaccines.

In some cases, pandemic vaccines are not regarded by regulatory authorities as entirely “new” vaccines, as they build on the technology used to produce vaccines for seasonal influenza, established procedures for testing and regulatory control, and an extensive body of safety data.

In such cases, approval procedures are similar to those applied to “strain changes” made each year when seasonal vaccines are modified to match circulating viruses in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

Specific regulatory procedures have been devised to expedite the approval of pandemic vaccines. In the USA, for example, fewer data are required when the manufacturer already has a licensed influenza vaccine and intends to use the same manufacturing process for its pandemic vaccine.",t3_9hpbg,c0ctird,,False,,,0,conspiracy,False,t5_2qh4r,0,t3_9hpbg,1,t1_c0ctird,shallah,0

1) Generally, I believe in the smallest amount of Government possible (I wouldn't take it as extreme as Libertarians would though)


2) I believe that the government taking care of us from cradle to grave goes against everything this country was founded on, and is extremely unhealthy in the long run


3) I'm sick of our generousity and lax borders being abused and no one willing to get serious about illegal immigration. Talk about another Amnesty is especially alarming (yes I know that Bush and many Republicans are for it - but nearly ALL Democrats are for it as well)


4) Republicans are the only ones (but unfortunately not all of them) who are willing to take on the extremely powerful trial lawyer lobby. The ""lawsuit culture"" is killing our economy and dramatically raising health care costs. I never understand why Democrats want to model health care after European systems but don't want to take any lessons from their tort systems.


5) I think late-term abortion is equivalent to murder. Few Democrats agree with that. 


6) I think ""affirmative action"" is morally wrong.


7) I believe nuclear power is our best and most climate-friendly alternative energy source right now. More Dems are getting on board with this now, but still not many.

This is an extremely ignorant statement. You know that an extremely large population of elephants negatively effects the environment and other species that are under pressure? Several species of antelope for instance live in tree filled places – yet those are rapidly disappearing the in the Kruger Park (because elephants destroy the trees). 

&gt; A few overzealous conservation laws are at least intended to do good,

A Democratic controlled congress has passed the financial bailout, car company bailout and the stimulus plan. So I doubt that you can blame it all on the Republicans. Also bear in mind that Europe and Japan has even worse financial problems yet they do not have conservative governments (their governments are various shades of liberal). 

&gt; and our quest for knowledge in general.

The budget for basic research increased significantly under Bush. So to blame conservatives is fairly wrong.

&gt; our freedoms,

Really? Did they try to take away your right to bear arms?

&gt; All things done on the right have been a result of vitriol, ignorance, hate, outrage, anger, wrath, bitterness and fear which is exactly how they mobilize their base.

Your post seems pretty hateful, agry, wrathish, bitter, fearsome and dare I say ignorant. Yet you are not conservative. How does this work?

&gt; It really isn't possible to do good when taking action because of those emotions.

It is also not good to take actions based on emotions such as blind trust. Or to take actions such as envy of the rich. 

&gt; In fact, I don't think I have seen a single social conservative show compassion for their fellow man or the world in even the most basic way.

There was an article on reddit a few years ago that showed that people in the “Red States” were more likely to give money to charity (when adjusted for income) than people in the “Blue states”. So I doubt that your accusation holds water.

&gt; I live in a red city inside of a red county and I have been dealing with these people my entire life.

That is not nice of you. Don’t you have compassion for “these people” as you like to refer to them? If you were referring to black people as “these people” it would have been racist. I think your hate for “these people” are worse than racism.

&gt; One person told me that they should be able to ticket people that eat badly if they are on public healthcare.

This may be naïve but it is a valid point. In my country several medical schemes offers free gym membership with the deal that you have to spend a certain amount of time in the gym. It is not perfect but it works.

&gt; The prohibition situation too. Even though a more rational approach to handing addiction as a health issue would likely cost less than imprisonment and do a better job of improving the lives of the afflicted, all they want is punishment.

Many people believe that if the “prohibition” of drugs is lifted more people would use drugs. I am completely in favour of lifting the prohibition – letting each person decide for himself. 

But I know full well than most drugs are a one way street (my mother works with some of these people. For some drugs &lt;5% of the people manage to stop and not relapse). Most people also do not have the good judgment not to start using drugs.

Oh, I haven’t seen the Democrats trying to lift the ban on drugs.

&gt;It is also not good to take actions based on emotions such as blind trust. Or to take actions such as envy of the rich.

That is how they make all of their decisions.  They expected blind trust of their master now didn't they? Is this a joke or something?  They see Obama as the elitist remember?  You are just trying to distract.

You can't be serious.  I have a lot of compassion for them and I know if they could gather a little more perspective and knowledge they could see the evils being done in their honor.  The problem is that they have been indoctrinated to despise knowledge that might challenge their indoctrination.  It is more sad than anything else.  It is sad because I know that they are hurting themselves without understanding the actual price.

&gt;This may be naïve but it is a valid point. In my country several medical schemes offers free gym membership with the deal that you have to spend a certain amount of time in the gym. It is not perfect but it works.

But I know full well than most drugs are a one way street (my mother works with some of these people. For some drugs &lt;5% of the people manage to stop and not relapse).

It doesn't matter if more people will do drugs or not.  Freedom is freedom.  If you can't acknowledge the freedom of your neighbor to own his or her body then you do not deserve the freedom to control yours.  What I do know is that prohibition makes drug use more dangerous by an order of magnitude than it needs to be and that it ruins more lives than just addiction could ever do.  Punishment is again the objective of prohibition and not the improvement of society.

&gt;Oh, I haven’t seen the Democrats trying to lift the ban on drugs.

Sadly, you are correct, but I have heard a few promising statements here and there.  Besides, now is not the time.  Imagine the way the extreme right would absolutely explode right now talking about how Obama wants to give babies heroin and coke or whatever they come up with.

&gt;Pigs are some of the most intelligent animals around. Would you stop eating bacon?

Yeah, I just don't like pigs, they're assholes.  I eat them out of general principle.  I'd eat asshole people too, but it is illegal.  So, I suppose it would be cool to eat the asshole whales.

&gt;Everything starts with a “course” which gets adapted into a blanket ban. I know – this has happened here.

I seriously doubt it is too much to ask to have people learn how to responsibly use a dangerous weapon that can kill instantly from many yards away in a heartbeat.

All I want is for us to stop making our decisions according to what we hate or fear and rather by what will do the most good and bring glory to our country and its people.

&gt;DAVID CERNY sends a rude text message to two bronze sculptures of naked, urinating men, which proceed to swivel their hips and move their protruding penises to trace his four-letter words into a pond shaped like a map of the Czech Republic.

To Mr. Cerny, bad boy of the eastern European art world, the playfully subversive computer-controlled duo — installed a few years ago in a sleepy courtyard here — are an apt commentary on the self-deprecating Czechs, who he contends have gritted their teeth through centuries of invasion and occupation, barely resisting and seldom winning at anything.
“The Czech attitude is not to be proud of being Czech,” said Mr. Cerny, a wiry, floppy-haired 41-year-old who resembles Mick Jagger. “It is a positive thing for me, but it also has a dark side, which is that we never won any war. In America, people are taught to be proud and as visible as possible. Here in this country, we are taught to be silent and invisible.”

No one could accuse Mr. Cerny, who once considered getting silicon breast implants and walking around Prague naked “to see how people would react,” of seeking silence or obscurity.
In this post-Communist age, in which former Marxists have reinvented themselves as captains of industry and dissidents have long since become presidents, Mr. Cerny is pursuing an artistic and political rebellion that is, perhaps by necessity, bolder and louder than his predecessors’.

He has painted a Soviet tank pink, depicted Prague’s heroic 10th-century King Wenceslas riding a dead, upside down horse and lampooned the incendiary, right-wing Czech president, Vaclav Klaus, by displaying a caricature of him inside a giant fiberglass anus.

“David Cerny is one of the region’s leading cultural and political satirists and one of a handful of Eastern European artists who have achieved global stature,” says Jan Vitvar, culture editor of Respekt, the Czech political weekly. “Some Czechs would prefer him to be grayer, more contemplative and behave less like a rock star, but no one can ignore him.”

Indeed, the Czech Republic, which recently gave up the six-month presidency of the European Union, is still reeling from the scandal caused by Mr. Cerny’s satire of European stereotypes in an eight-ton mosaic of the bloc’s 27 nations called “Entropa” last January.

The piece, which was installed at the European Council building in Brussels, was supposed to proudly display unique traits of each country in the union. Instead, it depicted Bulgaria as a Turkish toilet, Catholic Poland as a group of priests raising a gay flag and Germany as a network of motorways eerily resembling a swastika.

Officials in Prague, who had commissioned the work to mark the Czech presidency, had asked Mr. Cerny to oversee a work by artists from each of the union’s member states. Instead, the sculpture turned out to have been entirely constructed by Mr. Cerny and two friends in an elaborate hoax. Mr. Cerny even fabricated fake biographies and Web sites for the nonexistent artists, along with pseudo-intellectual absurdist texts. The fictional Bulgarian artist Elena Jelebova notes that she sought to create a “punk gesture, intentionally primitive and vulgar, fecally pubertal.”

Several countries demanded an apology, which the Czech government — and Mr. Cerny — grudgingly provided, prompting some critics to ask whether the prankster had caved in to the forces of political correctness.

MR. CERNY attributed his apology to emotional exhaustion. And he insisted that he had no regrets about creating a work that many critics have lauded as ingenious political art, exposing the cultural insecurities of an old continent. Indeed, the international debate spurred by “Entropa” may prove the most enduring legacy of the Czech presidency, which was deemed a disaster after the Czech government collapsed midway through.

“When the hoax was exposed, I went into a deep depression,” Mr. Cerny said. “It was hard to have that weight on my head. I regret how it all unfolded, but I wouldn’t hesitate to do it again. It was fun.”

The ruse elevated Mr. Cerny to the status of folk hero in his native country and spread his already growing reputation worldwide, including to the United States, where he has exhibited in New York, Philadelphia and Chicago.

But some critics, like Milan Knizak, the director of Prague’s National Gallery, counter that “Entropa” is little more than a cynical provocation by an artistic shock jock who has made a career out of thumbing his nose at the establishment.

“There is nothing special about David Cerny’s art, other than that he is more visible than other artists and talented at marketing,” Mr. Knizak said. “But artists like Cerny who are in headlines today will be forgotten tomorrow. His work is destined for the amusement park and won’t stand the test of time.”

Mr. Knizak, whom Mr. Cerny once depicted inside the same towering sculpture of a rectum where he placed his other nemesis, Mr. Klaus, may not be the most objective critic.

In a 2003 work titled “Brown-nosers,” museumgoers were asked to climb a ladder and peer into a hole in the huge white rear end, where a video showed impersonators wearing rubber masks of Mr. Klaus and Mr. Knizak, feeding each other slop to the tune of “We Are the Champions.” Mr. Cerny is so contemptuous of Mr. Knizak, whom he accuses of fawning on the establishment, that he once refused to enter the National Gallery to accept an award. “It was hate at first sight,” he said.

Mr. Cerny first drew attention in May 1991, when, at 22, he was arrested after painting a giant Soviet tank pink, transforming a memorial to the liberation of Czechoslovakia by the Red Army in 1945 into the sculptural equivalent of a large pink toy.

Recalling his hooliganism, for which he spent a few days in prison, Mr. Cerny said the tank had been a symbol for him and his generation of the Soviet-led occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and a monument to decades of Russian oppression. “I was sick and tired of passing by this tank, two years after Communism had fallen,” he said. “I was standing with a friend one day at a tram stop nearby staring at it and we both decided we should defile it.”

THE son of a painter and a restorer of 15th-century art, Mr. Cerny traces his impulse to revolt to a childhood under Communism, when freedom of expression was suppressed.

When he was 4 years old, a statue of Lenin was erected in a square near his house. One day, he and his father were driving by, and his father muttered, “They would be better off building streetlights.” When he repeated this at kindergarten, he said, the teacher called his parents to warn about their young subversive.

“After that, my parents were afraid to say things in front of me, and I had problems with refusing to be quiet,” Mr. Cerny said.

Today, he commands six-figure private commissions and owns his own four-seater plane, somewhat undermining his status as a cultural dissident.

And yet, 20 years after the fall of the Iron Curtain, he laments, his parents still warn him to be careful.

“The Czechs can’t get out of their ‘be careful’ mentality,” he said. “It is in our brains and in our bodies because of decades of watching out, of worrying that your neighbors are spying on you.”",t3_9ho3n,c0ctro0,,False,,,0,Art,False,t5_2qh7a,0,t1_c0cti87,3,t1_c0ctro0,TheRiff,0

Even if it is good now, it will not stay that way without significant overhaul.  In fact, all of the best social programs in European countries are running deficits year after year.  That doesn't mean the US system is better (it isn't), it just means that we don't want to be emulating unsustainable programs, especially on a scale this massive.  Our medicare, medicaid and social security programs represent the majority of our obligations.  They dwarf all other obligations, even our defense budget.

Sure, there is great resistance to removing the NHS, but it's a fiscal failure.  You can't run a program on hopes and dreams and pretend it will work; it has to be fiscally prudent as well, because if it runs deficits year after year your children will be enslaved by the god-state mentality.  This mentality is the very same mentality that is turning your country into a surveilliance society, as well as ours, but few Brits seem to see that the concept of a maternal government eventually leads to such things.  

I don't see the use of socialized medicine if it leads to an unfree country.  I would rather be free and dying of some strange disease or injury than be enslaved and well treated by my master.  Fortunately there's a way out of both problems.  With a free market in health care and an emphasis on charity, people will be able to remain free AND care for the poor.  

Our health care system was the best in the world before the government interfered in it, and that interference has resulted in disaster.  If you doubt that, look at other countries where there is a freer market than the european nations, than ours, and it should be plainly obvious that they're better than all of the socialized systems, ours included. 

And yes, ours is a socialized system by half.  48% of our spending on health care is for government programs and, like the NHS, they're all running huge unsustainable deficits.  You cannot fix this by forcing more people into these programs.  You can only fix the allocation problem by allowing the actors themselves to self-allocate.

 Ignore all the downvoting you're getting from all these people. Reddit.com has a hive mind mentality where if one person replies with a somewhat reasonable response and it sounds politically correct and it gets just enough votes to ""push it over the hill"" then others will join the bandwagon. Likewise, if one person gets negged, then others will join the bandwagon as well and neg the hell out of that person. 

I like the points that you make, and your sour experiences highlight the dual nature of human personality (rather than focusing on one side of an issue alone (as many people do). People like to focus on the most ideal/good outcomes and ignore the bad --- and that's a big reason why we have so many problems . Ying and yang people, that's why we have debate, because there are multiple lenses to look through into an issue and there will never be an objective truth in things ultimately concerning philosophical ideas (rather than knowing for sure that every human being will die eventually, or that 2+2 = 4 is always true.).

The more you realize the multiple outcomes, the better prepared you'll be mentally. 

Anyways, I'm supporting you on this issue, not because I believe that women are 100% like this, but rather because it sheds light on one facet of human nature that is latent in both men and women (and personally as a man, you could argue that for whatever reasons, whether it's genetics or environment [social norms, culture, etc], that American women often have a stereotypical reputation of being crazier/more demanding than women from other countries).

I would also dismiss the garbage the others here are saying about having a personality disorder --- or not having ""tons of friends."" Frankly, I have found those who conform again to a certain idea without knowing why just because others do it are more under the influence of society on them  --- they don't think for themselves. 

And that's why a lot of ""disorders"" like ADHD/ADD, depression, even bipolar disorder, ""personality disorder"" are OVERDIAGNOSED especially in America. We label anyone as a ""misfit"" or ""abnormal"" or anything that doesn't fit society's servile/compliant expectations --- and some of you may deem me as the quiet, shy, lonely type of guy but I'm not (a varsity soccer player, get along great with people and as such, likeable), I just don't prefer small talk (more of an ideas kinda of guy). 

And you're right KonP, human beings have a part of them that are very deplorable. I've come to realize that the world has a lot more tragedy and cruelty in it than one would expect, but over time, I've come to terms with the imperfections of human nature and of people's limitations to just ""let it be."" 

Like I said before, don't get down from the crap a lot of these redditors give you based on ""your negative karma."" A lot of these people will jus say stuff that sounds good without being true to themselves and what they truly feel or believe. 

In the end, do I blame you for being overtly negative/cynical about life/relationship? Nope, you had bad experiences as have many others (not saying I have necessarily --- I'm personally happy imo). I do hope though that you find someone who is a little more balanced (and there are women who are like that --- hint --- try finding a foreign girl from Canada/Asia/Europe as they're more rooted in family values/cultural values/etc) and that over time you come to terms with this aspect of human nature and move on from that point (I'm not saying to forget about that experience but to build upon it constructively when meeting new people and using this knowledge for understanding human relations). Once you realize that people aren't as golden as we'd like them to be, do things to improve yourself so that you don't have to deal with that shit. Be the one who is superior - intellectually, financially, physically (i.e. working out, eating well, etc.) and don't feel the need to ""fit in"" for the sake of ""fitting it."" You don't need to have ""TONS OF FRIENDS"" like ""stubblygoodness"" said, and one could wager that those who have ""TONS OF FRIENDS"" often have shallow friendships over ones with a few people that are deeper --- just a different animal --- hell even if you're a loner (not my candy, I'm more of a few friends kind of guy, but to each his/her own) --- most of the great thinkers/inventors lived in their own world (Einstein, Bernard Shaw, Gandhi, Da Vinci, Jobs --- ""THINK DIFFERENT"", Forbes, etc.)  and they were happier like than being an average run of the mill kind of guy --- yes they ""socialized"" with others but it wasn't socializing in say going out and partying or just ""chilling"" but rather having intellectual conversations in real life.

And finally, my asshole comment of the day --- a lot of the guys on reddit.com and in America have this servile attitude to the pussy (putting the pussy on the pedestal) -- and it shows you that men's rights (there's a subreddit on men's right coincidentally) have been eroded --- in some places its good (better/more equal pay for women, eliminating discrimiantion against women in the workforce, sexual harassment, etc). , but in others it's been fucked --- i.e. alimony, child custody, etc. will ALWAYS go to the woman. It's become the case now where it's dangerous to marry because you can lose most of your precious assets that it's simply not worth it (unless you come to a very explicit arrangement with the girl --- which is again difficult to do --- in this case, like I said before, FIND A FOREIGN GIRL!).
 
Hope that helps/balances things out a bit,

Right, as in invaders that came from the north and conquered India. Also, I believe the swastika is far older than the Indus valley civilzation.

&gt; The symbol has an ancient history, appearing on artifacts from Indo-European cultures such as the Indo-Aryans, Persians, Hittites, Slavs, Celts and Greeks, among others. **The earliest consistent use of swastika motifs in the archaeological record date to the Neolithic. The symbol was found on a number of shards in the Khuzestan province of Iran and as part of the ""Vinca script"" of Neolithic Europe of the 5th millennium BC.** In the Early Bronze Age, it appears on pottery found in Sintashta, Russia. Early Indian swastika symbols were found at Lothal and Harappa, on Indus Valley seals.

True,1426038352,1252216780,1,"Quite right.  We did not evolve to use chemotherapy and all those other things you mentioned.  They are wonderful, beneficial additions to the human lifestyle.  You are missing my point.

I am a fan of broccoli and lettuce.  However, we most certainly did not ""poof[ed] those things into existence"".  We evolved alongside them.  Virtually every domesticated plant has a natural, wild relative.  These natural relatives were our standard diet.  This can be proven again and again throughout the planet.  Agriculture was a process of domestication of the plant species we subsisted on.  Our domestication of these species is irrelevant and begging the question.  Your implication: We didn't eat these things in nature but we eat them now but didn't evolve to eat them; is factually incorrect.  We ate the relative of that thing and then proceeded to domesticate it to make it taste better, yield better, feed us better.  (P.S. this is not genetic engineering, it is called selective breeding.  You are using the term incorrectly)

However, in your next point you are correct.  We did not evolve to eat and drink specific things, but rather are an adaptable species with metabolic pathways to process a variety of foods.

Some of us did adapt to drink milk.  Others did not.  I presume here that both of us are of European descent.  Both of us are likely able to drink milk and are lactose tolerant.  Milk was a crucial component of the European diet.  Europe is cold and inhospitable in winter - food is scarce.  Milk, particularly in the form of cheese and other preservable milk products are a long-existing companion of the European diet.  I strongly suspect you are right about whey protein.  I cannot see any specific issue with it.  I doubt there is any negative effect from eating moderate amounts of whey protein.  I personally prefer whole sources of protein but don't see any issue with whey.  However, I will say the this: you are making a gross assumption in your statement ""[whey] is able to fit perfectly into the pathways evolution selected for us"".  You have absolutely no grounds for making this statement.  Whey fits into one small part of a much larger pathway.  You state this like the metabolic pathway, it's positive and negative feedback loops, and behaviours at extremes (eating too much whey, for example, which the human body most certainly did not evolve to do) are well understood.  You are patently incorrect.  You cannot even begin to imagine how poorly understood these cycles really are.  Your faith in science being all-knowing here is misplaced.  Perhaps one day; but at present you are completely wrong.  By this I am not implying that whey is good or bad.  I am saying we do not know but given present information it likely has observable beneficial effects and only slight negative ones.  Before you accuse me of hating on whey, note that all consumption has both beneficial and negative effects.  It is the balance that makes the difference.

You will notice, by now, that I do not believe in extremes either way.  You are correct that this makes me a naturalist.  I wear that name with pride, let me tell you.

But it is your closing paragraph where you veer horribly off course and destroy your central thesis.  That what we evolved to do is not what we should do.  Here, I am afraid, you are not even wrong.  We evolve by selective pressure.  We evolve into the form that minimises selective pressure on our species.  This means that we evolve to reduce the environmental pressures on us to die!  If we do not live according to our evolution, we increase the selective pressure on us.  In other words we increase possibility of our death and poor health.  Your genes are currently written to work according to a range of variables.  If you want to optimise your health, fitness, and life you should remain as much within those variables as you can.  Denying this is to completely misunderstand the process of evolution.

Your final point is the worst however.  You offer our modern-day lifespans up as proof that changing our diet and lifestyle has increased our lifespans.  You are completely and utterly wrong.  The reason our lifespan has increased so dramatically since the industrial revolution is due to the reduction of poverty (the biggest factor of them all - look it up), disease, drastic reduction of infant mortality, better sanitation, waste disposal, and other factors affecting epidemiology.  It has absolutely nothing to do with changing diets whatsoever!  Up until 40 years ago, our diets remained largely unchanged.  The only thing that changed was much greater access to plentiful food for all.  This is what radically altered our average lifespans.  Even before the industrial revolution the rich had *substantially* greater lifespans than the poor.  The average lifespan increase was merely the effect of an increase of the food supply due to the industrialisation of agriculture.  There is substantial evidence that as the west switches to the junk-laden, processed-garbage diet of the modern age, the mortality rate is once again increasing.  It is *precisely* because it is increasing selective pressure on us yet again, operating outside of what you evolved to eat.  Metabolic syndrome is precisely such a problem and a recent one at that.

In conclusion, I would like to say the following.  I do not believe in extreme points of view.  The world is not black and white and natural systems are far more complex than the other, more mathematical sciences (like physics, chemistry and so on).  Exercise restraint when planning your diet and err on the side of caution.  I believe it is a responsible, scientific, and very defensible point of view.

True,1426038354,1252217086,2,"&gt;The document on the WHO website linked below states that it is common procedure to release pandemic viruses into the population in order to get a jump ahead of the real pandemic, so as to fast track the vaccine for when it is needed. 

No, it does not. Not at all, not even close. Why make a claim about a link when the claim is so clearly false?

&gt;What you may not know, however, is that WHO, together with health officials, regulatory authorities and vaccine manufacturers, have been working since 2007 – long before this new “threat” of swine flu emerged – to “explore a broad range of issues surrounding the regulatory approval of pandemic vaccines.” 

Well good for them. I am glad that someone actually tried to prepare for a problem rather than simply panicking when it was too late.

&gt;One such method used in Europe is to conduct advance studies using a “mock-up” vaccine that contains an active ingredient for an influenza virus that has not circulated recently in human populations.

&gt;When testing these mock-up vaccines, it is very possible to release the novel influenza virus into the population, as its purpose is to “mimic the novelty of a pandemic virus” and “greatly expedite regulatory approval.”

How did you go from ""old"" virus to ""novel"" virus? And the goal is to get approval of the vaccine by showing that it is safe. How is that a problem?

&gt;Labeling the vaccine a “strain change” rather than an entirely “new” vaccine. This method states the new vaccine has built on technology used to produce vaccines for seasonal influenza, and the change for the pandemic vaccine is similar to a strain change used to produce a new seasonal vaccine each flu season.

Yes, so? What precisely is your problem with this?

* Everyone is a fuck up, but some people are better at hiding it or just not worrying about it.
* You are both smarter and dumber than you realize.
* You can get better at pretty much anything with practice.  Most people who seem to be ""natural"" at something only seem that way because they have had a lot of practice.
* You're going to keep getting wiser about things.  You may think of yourself as pretty smart now, and an adult, but you'll look back and realize how naïve you were.  Always.  At 25, you'll think you were naïve and foolish at 16, and at 36, you'll know how little you really understood at 25.
* The ""life decisions"" you think matter a lot (e.g., which college to go to, which job to take) often really don't.  Often you can spend time agonizing over a decision, but much of the time you are choosing between ""good"" options and either option will actually make you happy.
* To make those life decisions, ask people about their experiences; because listening to them describe what it is like to do something is much more accurate than just trying to imagine it.  Be on the lookout for things that resonate with you, seem like they'd be cool or fun (or horrible).  But you should mostly ignore advice about which option you should choose from people who say *X* is better than *Y* when they haven't tried *Y* (e.g., to decide whether to go to Europe or South America, don't just talk to someone who went to Europe and says that's the best thing to do; don't decided to go to grad school solely because someone with a Ph.D. thinks you should).
* Things that seem totally beyond your reach *can* be done;  you never have to do the whole thing at once, you just figure out the next step forward and do that, and eventually you get there.
* In college/university, you'll have more freedom than you do later on when you have a job.  Try to enjoy it.
* You aren't necessarily the person that knows you best, you're on the inside, but you're stuck in now with only your own memory (which is hugely influenced by your current state of mind) to go on.  You're not always the best judge of what will make you happy.
* Try to say ""Yes"" to things.  You'll go to more parties, meet more people, try more new things.
* You aren't invincible.  Dumb actions that could screw up your later life probably don't seem nearly as foolish as they should, so try to compensate.
* Anything that can mean anything really means nothing (which means that you should distrust most religion).

If it mathematically looked and acted like writing, they concluded, then surely it is writing.

Only if you also show that non-writing doesn't act like writing in this respect.  Rao's group never compared the Indus Valley signs to any (real) non-linguistic symbol systems.  When Farmer, Sprout, and Witzel calculated the conditional entropy for a corpus of European heraldic signs, they found that it was similar to that of various written languages ([PDF](http://www.safarmer.com/more.on.Rao.pdf)).

If money is your concern, I""ve got a dilly of an idea for you: How about we get out of Iraq and stop spending the estimated 170 million per day there? That'll give us a start. People are fond of saying, ""Freedom isn't Free,"" and while that's true, neither is strength. Having the benefit of a healthy, vital nation isn't something that's going to be just *given* to you.

&gt;while magnifying the scope of government.

Let's be honest here. We're talking about providing an opportunity for everyone to get care. You might have fears about government spy planes sitting on your front lawn, but that's not what this is suggesting.

&gt;when a bankrupt country has to cut corners to afford healthcare they will start taxing and outlawing anything and everything that they dictate is unhealthy.

Bullshit. If we are a bankrupt country, as you say, and if this idea were true, then we'd be ""cutting corners every step of the way and outlawing anything and everything we can"" already. Maybe you feel like you've been arrested for new and fancy things recently, but I sure haven't.

&gt;that is not free healthcare, that is authoritarianism.

The keyword here is 'free'. Nobody's said it was free, and if they did they either misspoke or were mislead. It will be *affordable*. As far as your authoritarianism claim goes, well, shit man. Taxes are a part of life. We like them to be as low as possible, but the fact is we all use shit that's paid for by taxes. So if you're so dead set against our currently existing system of ""taxing and outlawing"" (I'm thinking of annual taxes and parking tickets as examples), then you might as well stop paying your taxes, stop using public utilities/services, and let us know how that turns out for you.

**I. Educate Yourself -- Forget Senior Prom**

""Drop out of school before your mind rots from exposure to our mundane educational system. Forget about the Senior Prom, go to the library and educate yourself if you've got any guts."" -- Frank Zappa

I have plenty of university education, but nothing that I ever learned on a college campus compares to what I have learned on my own through conversation with people smarter than me, studying on my own time and traveling around, exploring the world. If I had to do it all over again, I would not have pursued formal education beyond high school, at least not so soon. I may have even tested out of high school.

""I do not believe much in education. Each man ought to be his own model, however frightful that may be."" -- Albert Einstein

""What does education often do? It makes a straight-cut ditch of a free, meandering brook."" -- Henry David Thoreau

""It is absurd and anti-life to be a part of a system that compels you to listen to a stranger reading poetry when you want to learn to construct buildings, or to sit with a stranger discussing the construction of buildings when you want to read poetry."" -- John Taylor Gatto

**II. Keep Your Promises -- Your Word Must Be Your Bond**

If you tell someone that you're going to do something, do it. You would be amazed at how many broken promises former friends and lovers remember a decade later. And you'll be astonished, one day, if you find yourself looking back wondering what could have gone differently had you kept your promises.

**III. Don't Be Afraid -- Take the Plunge, Fight Back**

Ask her (or him) out. Don't allow anyone to bully you around. Learn a practical martial art. Stand up for what you believe in. Always kiss the girl at the end of your first date. Being turned down or catching a black eye is nothing compared to what you gain. And your boldness will be remembered.

""Life expands or contracts in direct proportion to one's courage."" -- Anais Nin

“It is better by noble boldness to run the risk of being subject to half the evils we anticipate than to remain in cowardly listlessness for fear of what might happen.” -- Herodotus (485-425BC)

""We must all suffer one of two things: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret or disappointment."" -- Jim Rohn

**IV. Travel -- Experience the World**

Travel. If you don't have a license and an automobile, save up for bus or plane tickets. Head to regional cities and historic sites. Visit museums, go to concerts. Travel farther away as you get older. Visit another country. Start with Canada, it's familiar enough. Save up and travel to your favorite European destination. Consider volunteering or working abroad. Teach English in Asia. Join the Peace Corps. Get out in the world. You'll learn a whole lot about humanity, but equally yourself.

**V. Laugh and Love -- Kiss the Broad!**

There is nothing in life more wonderful than being with someone you love. Keep yourself open to falling in love. Allow yourself to be submersed in it. Hold your lover in bed, kiss her, remember every detail about those intimate moments. Remember her perfume? How soft her hair was? Her reaction to the way you touch her? Nothing tops those moments. Nothing even comes close.

**Random Pieces of Bonus Advice**

Tell your parents, grandparents and siblings that you love them. Don't wrack up credit card debt. Learn to save your money. Read substantial literature. Wear a condom, or accept responsibility if you choose not to. Want to get high? Give it a shot once or twice, but don't allow yourself to be swept away by it. Stay away from hard drugs.

We Want Real Answers About 9/11

On August 31, 2004, Zogby International, the official North American political polling agency for Reuters, released a poll that found nearly half (49.3%) of New York City residents and 41% of those in New York state believe US leaders had foreknowledge of impending 9/11 attacks and ""consciously failed"" to act. Of the New York City residents, 66% called for a new probe of unanswered questions by Congress or the New York Attorney General. 

In connection with this news, we have assembled 100 notable Americans and 40 family members of those who died to sign this 9/11 Statement, which calls for immediate public attention to unanswered questions that suggest that people within the current administration may indeed have deliberately allowed 9/11 to happen, perhaps as a pretext for war. 

We want truthful answers to questions such as: 

Why were standard operating procedures for dealing with hijacked airliners not followed that day? 
Why were the extensive missile batteries and air defenses reportedly deployed around the Pentagon not activated during the attack? 
Why did the Secret Service allow Bush to complete his elementary school visit, apparently unconcerned about his safety or that of the schoolchildren? 
Why hasn't a single person been fired, penalized, or reprimanded for the gross incompetence we witnessed that day? 
Why haven't authorities in the U.S. and abroad published the results of multiple investigations into trading that strongly suggested foreknowledge of specific details of the 9/11 attacks, resulting in tens of millions of dollars of traceable gains? 
Why has Sibel Edmonds, a former FBI translator who claims to have knowledge of advance warnings, been publicly silenced with a gag order requested by Attorney General Ashcroft and granted by a Bush-appointed judge? 
How could Flight 77, which reportedly hit the Pentagon, have flown back towards Washington D.C. for 40 minutes without being detected by the FAA's radar or the even superior radar possessed by the US military? 
How were the FBI and CIA able to release the names and photos of the alleged hijackers within hours, as well as to visit houses, restaurants, and flight schools they were known to frequent? 
What happened to the over 20 documented warnings given our government by 14 foreign intelligence agencies or heads of state? 
Why did the Bush administration cover up the fact that the head of the Pakistani intelligence agency was in Washington the week of 9/11 and reportedly had $100,000 wired to Mohamed Atta, considered the ringleader of the hijackers? 
Why did the 911 Commission fail to address most of the questions posed by the families of the victims, in addition to almost all of the questions posed here? 
Why was Philip Zelikow chosen to be the Executive Director of the ostensibly independent 911 Commission although he had co-authored a book with Condoleezza Rice? 
Those who are demanding deeper inquiry now number in the hundreds of thousands, including a former member of the first Bush administration, a retired Air Force colonel, a European parliamentarian, families of the victims, highly respected authors, investigative journalists, peace and justice leaders, former Pentagon staff, and the National Green Party. 

As Americans of conscience, we ask for four things: 

An immediate investigation by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer 
Immediate investigation in Congressional Hearings. 
Media attention to scrutinize and investigate the evidence. 
The formation of a truly independent citizens-based inquiry. 
Given the importance of the coming election, we feel it is imperative that these questions be addressed publicly, honestly, and rigorously so that Americans may exercise their democratic rights with full awareness. 

In closing, we pray and hope for the strength to approach this subject with wisdom and compassion so that we may heal from the wounds inflicted on that terrible day.

As far as utopia goes, I want to disagree. I may sound like some pessimistic and/or angsty guy here who for some reason have a bone to pick with Norway, but I promise I'm not. We have free education, but the educational standards are surpassed by a lot of other countries in my opinion. Our road infrastructure is laughable compared to many other European countries. We have very high tax levels and other expenses which means that even though we have high income it isn't comparably high to other western countries after tax/expenses. Our health care isn't the best in the world as advertised, but still it's okay. Hospital lines to get any sort of advanced care are pretty long. I'd still say we have a better system than you do in the US though, health insurance sounds like a scam.

Not so. A portion of his time might be spent on development. A competitor may spend 100% of their time on marketing.

I see no inherent advantage in the marketing of a piece of software by the original developer. In fact since his time is more limited and his skill set necessarily different I actually see he is at a disadvantage.

&gt; The problem of developers charging $0 and then begging for donations (which are few and far between) is far more disgusting to me.

I totally agree. I hate this practise. I would prefer developers collecting a fee for the hard-work they do.

There are no stray Central American, African or Middle Eastern, North Korea, Pacific Island nations or other nations out there using a different system.

True,1426038933,1252284657,1,"&gt;The reason people are voting for the BNP is because they're scared for their inner city communities. Many have changed beyond recognition in the last 20 years, in Birmingham, and Peterborough, and other parts of London.

I'm not sure this is true, mainly because we are seeing BNP support in areas where immigrant populations are both long lived and fairly stagnant (i.e. they are not a recent and growing phenomenon).  I would suggest instead that some people are reacting as they often do in a recession and looking for scape-goats. Immigrants make easy targets in that whether they are Asian or Polish.  

Secondly recent election successes can probably be put down to disenchantment with the mainstream parties, most of the traditional Labour people I know who didn't vote Labout voted 'Green' in the EU elections, whilst those more conservatives people I know voted UKIP, BNP and Conservative.

Thirdly, the BNP are also moderating their public positions.  I actually had someone suggest that they aren't racist anymore, just xenophobic... In either case it does seem that they are being seen as more acceptable and possibly even as being the victims of oppression. 

As to the way you describe the immigration process as being extremely rapid at present, well that is true, but it isn't all that different to how it has happened in the past.  We seem to see immigration in waves, with those that remain becoming more integrated over time.  People fail to see that of course, and it tallies with when there has previously been more or less support for groups like the BNP (or indeed the NF).

&gt;I think many voters of the BNP just want their requests to be heard,

I think this may be a little generous, I don't think that there is no choice on the issues amongst the other parties, or that the BNP offers more chance for moderate positions to be heard (although that may be the perception now...).  I would suggest that the vast majority support the BNP's aims or at least their understanding of them.

&gt;I know it's not a popular stance - but most of the runners for our government are too attracted by the big salary and massive retirement fund to rock any kind of boat - educational, social, our 'special' relationship with the US (in what way!?), with the armed forces.... the list covers all aspects of control the government has.

I would probably say that this is a little false.  In education terms (and indeed health and social terms) we have seen big swings in policy over the years, the support for the Military has been an ongoing constant, but hardly one matched by policy either.  As to the special relationship, well we will see, it is the one area where there really is no difference between any of the parties, no one seems to have noticed quite how one sided and counter productive it has become.

&gt;We need some leaders that aren't in it for the money.

I think most MPs aren't.  The issue with the expenses thing and even salaries is less about money and more about people being people.  If you can vote yourself a pay rise and really think you are doing a good job, you probably will.  As it was in the MP's case , most thought that they were under paid, and in lieu of pay increases the expenses thing got ludicrous.   It isn't comparable to a proper corruption scandal, nor do I see it as an indicator of 'the rot setting in'.  There were those who were somewhat excessive and they indeed may be seen as having taken the piss, but most of the claims were moderately sensible and other issues were the kind of thing you would expect an accountant to do...

As to vocations, well there I do agree with you, we could pay MP's less, we could certainly remove their privileges, I don't even think it would be disastrous or lead to the best people not becoming MP's (power attracts after all), but I think it might not do the kind of good you expect.

True,1426038993,1252290771,2,"I tried to explain why I calculated the tax as inclusive rather than exclusive.  You are right, that with current sales taxes, on a $100 item, a 25% sales tax would mean the item costs $125. This is because the tax is added at the time of purchase.  With the Fair Tax, the tax is already included in the price.  You pay whatever is on the price tag.  The seller is the responsible for giving a percentage of that to the government.  Using the same example, you pay the vendor $125, and the vendor gives the governement $25, which is 25/125 or 20%.  

This is the same way income tax is calculated.  If you make $125 a year, and you pay 20% in tax, you pay 20% of $125, or $25.  Consider a paycheck stub.  If you made $125 a year, but had the IRS take out $25 each check, your take home pay would be $100.  Now, you paid $25 in taxes, but you wouldn't calculate your tax rate based on your take home pay. If you did that, your tax rate would be $25/$100, or 25%.  Of course, that doesn't make sense, cause your rate should be based as a percentage of your total income, not as a percentage added on to your income.  The same with the Fair Tax, the rate is a percentage of the final price, not a percentage added on to the final price.

You bring up a good point about where the money of a prebate would go.  It is very likely that some people will blow their prebate much like many people blow their tax refund (eventhough the refund is THEIR money that the government has been earning interest on all year).  Worse than just blowing it on non-necessities would be spending it on drugs or other things detrimental to their health or well-being.

That being said, I can't accept the excuse that it's a bad idea because some people lack the ability to manage it.  Certainly, this is a valid concern, but I think it's one that could be addressed without throwing out the whole thing, whether it be through financial planning and education being made available, or by making the prebate a debit card system like food stamps that can only be spent on certain items.  Of course the problem with restricting the prebate is that it restricts it for everyone.  I don't think any system is perfect, but I would prefer this system if given the choice.

As for tourism, many European countries have a VAT which is sales tax.  That means that every visitor in the country who purchases souvenirs, food, clothing, etc pays into their tax pool.  We would simply be taking advantage of what they are already doing.

As for black-market products, you should remember that every product legally sold in the US would have the same tax built into it, including raw materials for bootlegged or knock-off products.

*A new study shows a direct link between standard childhood vaccination series, MMR, and autism-like symptoms in monkeys. The principal scientist involved in the study, Dr. Laura Hewitson of the University of Pittsburgh, presented the alarming conclusions as an abstract pending publication at the International Meeting for Autism Research. It has been presented at scientific conferences in both London and Seattle, USA.* Wow, an unpublished abstract that was presented at two conferences - why, that's basically a published article from *Nature*

*The study compared vaccinated macaque monkeys with non-vaccinated macaques.* n=?
*No major flaws in the study have been revealed by any attending scientist.* [citation needed]  - what is this supposed to mean, nobody at the conference where this was presented actually stood up and shouted 'heretic!' ?
*The vaccines included the popular MMR series. The study found a marked increase in “gastrointestinal tissue gene expression” and “inflammation issues” with those monkeys which received vaccinations.* std=?
*They are a common symptom of children with regressive autism.* They are also common symptoms of any condition affecting the gastrointestinal tissue.

Can we assume this 'study' has paradigmatic validity? Are macaque monkeys the same as human babies? Are they close on the evolutionary tree? Do they have the same genome for said expressed genes?

*The study also found marked behavior changes* [what changes] *and development differences* [what differences] *in those monkeys given the vaccines versus those who were not. “Compared with unexposed animals, significant neuro-developmental deficits* [what deficits] *were evident for exposed animals in survival reflexes, tests of color discrimination and reversal, and learning sets,” the study`s authors reported.* are these related to autism or any defined developmental disorder? *“Differences in behaviors were observed between exposed and unexposed animals and within the exposed group before and after MMR vaccination.”*
Sorry, differences were observed *before and after* vaccination the 'exposed' group? Exposed to what, the vaccine? Before and after.... having the vaccine? WTF?

*US Government-mandated research approved by Congress was to begin this year, but the funds were rescinded in early January. Claiming “conflict of interest” because of ongoing court cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a long-time supporter of infant vaccinations, withdrew the research plans.*
What does this paragraph even mean? What research into what? It was government mandated, but the CDC (a long 'supporter' of vaccinations, how unusual) withdrew research plans.... for what? ""vaccines""?

*The most shocking of all is the recent and now common medical practice, reinforced by an aggressive pharmaceutical industry,* [citation needed] *of giving multiple vaccines, often virtually within hours of birth, to infants despite the fact that no study including all of the vaccine series commonly given to children in the US and UK, about 30 in all, has been conducted until now.* [citation needed]
This is only shocking if you first accept that giving vaccines at birth is shocking, which is now presupposed in the article, since it's attacking vaccines.
*The practice of newborn multiple vaccinations has become widespread in Germany and other EU countries over the past decade. Significantly there have surfaced reports of dramatically increased instances of autism in newborn and infants in various German hospitals over the past decade, precisely the period multiple vaccinations of newborn and infants has become routine.*
Repeat after me, **CORRELATION DOES NOT SUGGEST CAUSATION**

The biggest shift, I think, in the past 10 years has been the shift in the industry in places like the US, Australia and Western Europe to outsource system implementation, either to IT shops in the sub-continent, or to vendors like SAP or Computer Associates.  This has meant that working in IT is now often about requirements elicitation and design/specification management, and systems integration rather than directly cutting code.

The kinds of shifts we see every three-four years are not on a grand scale, and it's only the people who see IT training as synonymous with vendor certification who can't weather such changes.  A proper, qualified, tertiary educated IT  professional should be able to quite easily adapt their skills to these small-scale industry shifts.  It's the bigger shifts like the one I described above that are more analogous to the big changes in architectural movements (eg. modernism, etc.).",t3_9hwmh,c0cuulb,,False,,,0,programming,False,t5_2fwo,0,t1_c0cutoh,19,t1_c0cuulb,rmeredit,0

Social democrats also promote tax-funded welfare programs and regulation of markets. **Many social democrats, particularly in European welfare states, refer to themselves as socialists, introducing a degree of ambiguity to the understanding of what the term means**. Libertarian socialism (including social anarchism and libertarian Marxism) rejects state control and ownership of the economy altogether and advocates direct collective ownership of the means of production via co-operative workers' councils and workplace democracy.

&gt;    Jordanian in arabic isn't ""jordani,"" that's the english translation of ""Urdun.

&gt;Are you denying that a common Palestinian name is Al-Jordani? A simple internet search shows how common it is, and that it is alternative spelling to the name Al-Urdani, and does in fact mean ""from Jordan"" - despite what you claim to know.

&gt;So, what do you think that name means?

&gt;    See very top.

Except it does, you didn't really even look at it did you (Ironically the papers were linked to by a pro-israeli, not even by myself, they were a good find nontheless.)

&gt;We propose that the Y chromosomes in Palestinian Arabs and Bedouin represent, to a large extent, early lineages derived from the Neolithic inhabitants of the area and additional lineages from more-recent population movements. **The early lineages are part of the common chromosome pool shared with Jews (Nebel et al. 2000)**. According to our working model, **the more-recent migrations were mostly from the Arabian Peninsula**, as is seen in the Arab-specific Eu 10 chromosomes that include the modal haplotypes observed in Palestinians and Bedouin. These haplotypes and their one-step microsatellite neighbors constitute a substantial portion of the total Palestinian (29%) and Bedouin (37.5%) Y chromosome pools and were not found in any of the non-Arab populations in the present study.

That's one quote from one of the Journals. Which goes to show the ethnic make up of palestine stayed relatively the same (when compared to other Jews) until the Arab conquests, when naturally some inter-racial mixing occured. Sure massacres happened, mongols and crusaders came and went, but that still didn't change the overall picture.

&gt;Are you denying that a common Palestinian name is Al-Jordani? A simple internet search shows how common it is, 

Yes, it's not a common name. And I'm sure the internet shows you many other things as well, such as, how wrong you are?

&gt;and that it is alternative spelling to the name Al-Urdani

JORDAN.IS.NO.SUCH.WORD.IN.ARABIC.

Then you acknowledge that that's what it comes off as. If you're self-made, then I take it back. I'm just more used to hearing the Marxism from people who have a safety net. It's easy to make a stand when your insurance or your food isn't at stake. In my mind, the realistic perspective is to put up, shut up, and adapt to situations without question, especially when you're on the bottom and just trying to get by. I feel that there's a time and a place to make a stand, and it's not when you're under the thumb of an employer with your well-being at stake.

I'm self made. I don't have to go into detail about it. I've worked manual labor and I've served in the military in order to put myself through college so I wouldn't have to do manual labor. I've done all this with nothing and I feel I'm better for it.. I understand when it's time to stand up and talk when it's time to shut the hell up and take. I think a haircut is just menial. It's just a simple issue of conformity- it's a symbol. What does it matter? It's too menial to lose a job over, especially when most companies enforce dress codes.

I feel my perspective was the realistic one here. If the OP is just working part time for beer money, then great, raise hell. If this is what pays his rent- it just isn't worth it. Self-righteous Americans just aren't that valuable anymore. The value of the American worker probably peaked sometime this century and is on the decline. The OP is not in an influential enough position to jeopardize himself to affect this trend or its side effects. 

Unfortunately, we're not in Western Europe. The situation is far more out of the hands of the American worker than it would be if our population had any sense of social organization for labor. Look, if you're serious about your background then I am genuinely sorry. I am just not used to hearing impassioned marxism from an adult... Marxism as a conversation piece is generally employed by those who need it least in my experience. I simply made an assumption on your background based on your demeanor and how your presented this argument, which was very *soapboxish*, to be fair, followed by condescending dismissal.

&gt;The most interesting example of the rise of European anti-Semitism is Spain. Spain is the only European country where negative views of Jews (held by 46 per cent of respondents to a survey) appear to outweigh positive ones (37 per cent) (7). According to a recent study, there has been a dramatic increase in anti-Semitism in Spain over the past three years. Unfavourable views of Jews have more than doubled from 21 per cent in 2005 to 46 per cent in 2008 (8).
&gt;
&gt;It is difficult to analyse fully this dramatic rise of anti-Semitic sentiment in Spain. It is possible, of course, that the survey failed to capture the real feelings and beliefs of its respondents, and thus might have overstated the prevalence of negative emotions. Moreover, someone who expresses a negative attitude towards Jews is not necessarily an anti-Semite: there is an important distinction to be made between negative stereotypes of a people and a feeling of hatred towards them. It is also likely that Spaniards, like young Muslims, are less inhibited from acknowledging their attitudes than respondents to surveys in other, perhaps more PC countries – and therefore the gap between Spaniards and other Europeans on the issue of Jews may be narrower than these recent figures suggest. However, other studies seem to have found a similar pattern of rising anti-Semitic feeling in Spain.
&gt;
&gt;One survey, carried out by the Anti-Defamation League, found that 47 per cent of Spanish respondents stated ‘probably true’ to at least three out of four anti-Semitic stereotypes presented to them. More interesting still is a recent poll commissioned by the Spanish Ministry of Education: it found that more than 50 per cent of secondary school pupils would rather not sit next to a Jewish classmate (9).
&gt;
&gt;Since Spain has a tiny Jewish population – fewer than 20,000 – it is unlikely that attitudes towards this minority are based on any experience of interacting with them. Rather, it appears that, in Spain, negative attitudes towards Jews are influenced by ideas that these people have no real loyalty to the countries they live in – in this instance, Spain – and also that they play a sometimes destructive international role. In Spain, anti-Semitism is linked to the prevailing mood of anti-Americanism. Many public figures blame Spain’s economic crisis on America’s influence over the global financial system. This outlook appears to be underpinned by a diffuse sense of frustration about our uncertain world, where invisible forces can come to be personified in the image of the caricatured Jew. This sentiment is inadvertently fostered by the Spanish Socialist government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, which is profoundly hostile to Israel, and by the Spanish media’s frequent reluctance to distinguish between Israel and Jewish people. Cartoons that are critical of Israel in Spanish newspapers and magazines sometimes depict medieval anti-Semitic caricatures. At a dinner party in late 2005, Zapatero let rip against Israel. He was overheard saying: ‘Es que a veces hasta se entiende que haya gente que puede justificar el holocausto.’ In English: ‘At times one can even understand that there might be people who could justify the Holocaust.’ (10)

My issue isn't that people don't need healthcare, I'd love it for everyone to have healthcare.  But just providing an federally funded option doesn't change that the costs are astronomical.  I think the costs should be addressed before anything else.

&gt;#
# Please explain, why you don't think you can legislate a social safety net for 300,000,000 people?

Because people have different needs in different areas, different problems, and different situations.  Like I said, a country of 9 million isn't even the population of New York City, if we were to scale your particular program up... we would lose billions to bureaucratic nonsense and congress adding on a half a trillion in riders.  The waste would still be there at the local/state level but I believe that they would be much more accountable and efficient.

wow, 2 hours and no response. That's a bit telling about the kind of men are on reddit!

Personally, I can't tell if it's an age or regional thing but..

when I was young and lived in north america, I found that the men I dated were very selfish. Giving to a woman is apparently a scary thing  because they don't know what to do. They also want to finish first or they just want head and be done for the night. It really was a one person thing for them and woman is simply performing for them. But I was young as we're my choices in men. 

It wasn't until I met men from other parts of the world (european) that actually loved giving as well as receiving. It's a co-pro for them. 
 And you can tell they enjoy it. Some of them get so turned on doing it to a woman and actually finish during. It is such a relief(pun intended) to be with a lover that doesn't get weird about a woman's body south of the breasts. 

Although I am older now so maybe it's a mix that my choices are to be with older men with more experience. I probably learned to make better choices in lovers too. ",t3_9hynz,c0cv5ea,,True,,,0,AskReddit,False,t5_2qh1i,0,t1_c0cv27g,3,t1_c0cv5ea,Smoogy,0

I really hate that bullshit argument.

Besides the fact that Sweden has a shitload of immigrants, the same things work pretty well in countries like the Netherlands.

But more importantly, virtually all Western European countries are way more culturally diverse than the US. Although Americans seem to have an obsession with trivialities like skin color, the fact is that the US is a culturally extremely homogeneous country. For us Western-Europeans, the cultural differences between a black American from NY and a white American from the Mid-West are marginal.

In Western-Europe on the other hand, people from two neighboring villages in the same country may not even speak the same language and have very different cultural traditions. How the fuck do you think all those wars happened? 

Add to that the shitloads of immigrants from colonial times (ever been to the UK or the Netherlands or France?) plus the truckloads of more recent immigrants, plus the relatively huge numbers of refugees and asylum seekers we let in compared to the US, and you can throw the whole ""racially homogeneous"" argument out of the window.

The mixed public-private French and German and Italian and British systems are far better than what we currently have in Canada. By rejecting reform outright without consideration you're as blinded by ideology as the Americans who refuse to consider reform of their system.

True,1426039527,1252330689,1,"Well, I would repeat what I feel is the most important overall concept which is that nobody really knows. The problem is there are too many variables and people are tempted to assume they know a lot more than they really do. I don't mean you in particular, I mean myself included and anybody else with an opinion. It's not simple. The idea of inflation is not simple to sort out no matter how much we would like it to be the case because often the basic concepts we take for granted are problematic. 

Having said that, I'd like to point out some things that you might find surprising. I should preface with a disclaimer that I'm am American living in Taiwan. I've been here for over twenty years and that obviously has a lot to do with the way I see things but it also means I get to see a lot of details about how things work. Among other things, I sometimes translate business documents related to large firms setting up shop in China and I've learned some rather surprising things from that work. 

I think the most surprising, I might even say shocking, thing that I learned in translating business documents for companies setting up factories in China is that these businesses are not merely about taking advantage of cheap labor. The fact is, what is happening is far more complex. The cheap labor was the initial driver for manufacturing in China, but nothing is static, things change and in China they change fast. 

In fact, most new manufacturing that is taking place in China is highly automated. This actually goes hand-in-hand with driving down labor costs. In order to avoid having to pay higher wages to specialized workers, the best strategy is to avoid specialized tasks completely by automating complex processes as much as possible. This obviously saves labor, but it adds costs. However, these costs are worth it because they create a sort of culture in which it is justifiable to pay all the workers the same low wage because it prevents the concentration of power in the hands of skilled workers. So, on balance, it makes sense to use advanced automation even though you're using low-wage workers. 

Now, so far, China represents a fairly small number of shipments for the robotics market at about a tenth of Europe's which is about twice as big as America's but it is also by far the fastest growing market with an exponential growth curve currently at forty percent annually. But stepping back from complete robots and looking at essential components of automated systems like stepper motors we find that the Chinese market is already about the same size as that of the US though still lagging behind Europe but again China is growing like mad where all other global markets are basically stagnant and have been for years. 

This issue of automation is a very important point because it dispels the notion that this is merely a relationship in which the poor suffering Chinese laborers suffering for the benefit of the American consumers. Certainly that was how it started off twenty or thirty years ago, but that was then and let me tell you that five years, much less twenty, is a hell of a long time in China. 

Another myth goes something like this: ""Well, they are doing all of our dirty manufacturing for us, but we keep the design technology and also keep all the marketing rewards so we still win."" Again, in the short term this looks good but it misses some very key points. If you look at the R&amp;D portfolio of any high tech company like Intel you will find out that they actually put only a tiny fraction of their efforts into designing circuits and I mean tiny. It almost doesn't exist. Well over ninety percent of the research and development is into how to improve the manufacturing process. So, the manufacturing literally is the technology. This fact has painfully come to the forefront in the latest trend called where Asian manufacturers have introduced Original Design Manufacturing where they don't just manufacture the products but also design them. And the users of these services are companies like Apple, Compaq, Dell etc. The tech market is now owned by the Chinese.  

So the Chinese aren't getting screwed by the US. It's quite the opposite and that's why the idea that they would want to hurt the US is so off-base. The US is China's sugar daddy, the US is China's milk cow. The idea of China wanting to hurt the US economy in any way is simply off in La La Land. China doesn't want to bury the US, they want to make the US fat and happy while they collect the money. There are no political ventures to undertake. That's not what China is about. What China wants is wealth and prosperity. 

What the US is for China is the way to overtake the Europeans. That's what China really wants. China sees that prosperity lies in integrating technology deeply into manufacturing and so does Europe. They're the real competitors if you look at the numbers. America is lost in the wilderness on this point thinking it's getting a good deal off-shoring everything. Sure, it seems cheap at first but while it gives you a rush it comes with a heavy dependency. But don't worry, prices will stay very low for now because the Chinese are using the American milk cow to grow fat off of while they build up to put European manufacturing to bed. 

When you put it in that perspective the whole thing with the treasuries is beautifully executed. The dollar can deflate and the yuan will let Sugar Daddy lead the way. Now who gets hurt? The only real loser looks like the Euro --the major competitor in the global manufacturing automation market. Let those guys get hurt for a few years while you continue transitioning all those labor intensive factories to automated ones and you become the world's printing press.

In the long run, it might be worth picking an airline and doing all your wandering on that one as the miles add up quickly.

True,1426039540,1252333025,1,"I'd say that 'a commitment between two people' is the baseline for what a marriage is. As you say about word-wars, if we differ in our understanding to that level, then we're not really talking about the same thing.

That said, I think we're closer to agreeing than maybe you do. Maybe I should define my current situation in case it's different where you are - I'm unsure what options are open to you and your location. 

I'm British and live in the UK (under England-and-Wales law, to be exact). Here, a hetro couple can have a civil marriage and a homo one a civil partnership. Other than the name, these are identical. Many places can register to be able to conduct 'civil ceremonies' - hotels, grand castles, fields with a nice view, etc. Churches, temples and synagogues can also offer marriages. In other words, a civil ceremony is obligatory, but it can be combined within a religious one.

I disagree with the difference in name, but other than that, hetro and homo couples are offered the same contract, with the same rights and obligations. I think this is a good situation. Is it that far from what you are proposing?

Now, here are some noun-verb reasons why I believe it's unlikely that as a culture we would turn marriage from a ""legal-religious-societal-personal"" hybrid into just a legal contract. 

* I'm not sure if this is possible in the US, but in the UK and many other European countries certainly (YMMV) there *is* a separation between legal and religious marriage. However, if I were to get married in a field and have my friend officiate, without a state approval of this ceremony, few would accept this as a 'real' marriage any more than I am married to Vicky, a girl I played house with aged 6. So state approval matters, if only for the mundane side of things such as who gets the house when you die, who has authority over your spouse, children, etc. I know it's not romantic, but it's practical.

* Why would it happen? I take your point that it's desirable to you, and no doubt to many others. But I'd wager that the overwhelming majority would see this as diminishing their own relationship. In other words, it ain't a vote-winner. There's no _reason_ for politicians to tamper with such a fundamental thread in people's lives.

* I hope, one day, to get married. Most people do. Whether that's societal conditioning, peer pressure, whatever - something that is desirable both from a personal and community level is unlikely to be destroyed without good reason - and the fact that gay people want to get married strengthens this, rather than weakening it.

&gt; The whole reason people are against same-sex marriage is the way it is being bulldozed through as 'equality', when even if you can't pinpoint why, it clearly isn't the case.

Check out this [BBC report](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3423159.stm). Since then not a lot has changed. 

Similarly, the film starts out with a series of scenes of people with freak medical accidents (I think one person had over five heart attacks) and act like this is normal, which is disingenuous. 

He also misses the point about how the entire tort system is the US would need to be reformed in order to reduce malpractice law suits in order to bring the cost of a single payer system down. This is a big difference between the US and other countries and it won't change over night (and it is a very complex issue because it effects more than just malpractice). 

Furthermore, the US drug companies profit model would need to completely change, resulting in rising costs across the board. The reason things are the way they are now is because the US wants to keep the hundreds of jobs and billions of dollars the drug companies create here in the America. If we changed the law, making it so they must give us the same deals as every other country, many would leave. This is why Obama is making deals with drug companies without outright forcing them to lower their prices through legislation (so far).

Finally, he fails to mention how much more doctors get payed here. Those of us who do have healthcare like the fact that this system attracts the best doctors.

Let me end this, with your mouse over the downvote button no doubt, by saying I am adamantly for health care reform, but Michael's suggestion of a single payer system with addressing ANY of these issues just makes the movie worthless. I've seen many better arguments right here on reddit that actually do take these facts into account and they don't cost money to see in theaters (not that I saw Sicko in a theater, but I think you get my point).",t3_9i2ff,c0cvbvn,,True,,,0,offbeat,False,t5_2qh11,0,t1_c0cvbct,31,t1_c0cvbvn,[deleted],0

[It doesn't bypass safety testing. (PDF)](http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/general/direct/pr/50155706en.pdf)

&gt;What documentation does the company need to present to the EMEA to support an application for a mock-up vaccine?
 
&gt;The EMEA’s scientific committee, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), looks at data on the methods used to make and test the mock-up vaccine, as well as the results from studies of the vaccine tested in healthy people. This information covers the immunogenicity of the vaccine (its ability to make the immune system, the body’s defence mechanism, produce antibodies against the virus strain), as well as its safety (side effects). The documentation also contains a ‘risk management plan’ that details what will be done to monitor the safe use of the vaccine in a pandemic.  

&gt;What are the next steps? 
&gt;The objective behind a mock-up vaccine is to have a marketing authorisation (licence) in place, which can be changed quickly in the event of a pandemic to include the responsible virus strain, once it has been identified. The mock-up vaccine itself is not expected to be used or stockpiled (stored for use in the future) before the outbreak of a pandemic. 
 
&gt;Once a pandemic has started, the company will first include the pandemic flu strain in the vaccine. It will then apply for a variation (a change to the vaccine’s marketing authorisation) by supplying full information to the CHMP on the vaccine including the new pandemic flu strain. Once the variation has been approved and been granted a marketing authorisation by the European Commission, the vaccine will be available for use. This variation will be processed quickly - normally within a few days - as most of the data on the pandemic flu vaccine will already have been reviewed during the assessment of the mock-up vaccine.

True,1426039585,1252340017,1,"I agree, it's a lot if you look at it with present-time eyes, but back then in the 33-43 many people liked what the Nazist did to drag Germany from hellhole to superpower. Hitler leaved the Danes alone because he liked our white hair and blue eyes and they allowed us to keep our goverment (with Nazist pulling the strings) so Denmark was still Danish runned.

What people think about is supporting their family, not running around in woods shooting at Nazist, but if you take away a mans family you will have a uprising, the Nazists never fought, bombed or made genocide in Denmark. There wasn't really a reason to fight, like in Poland or Eastern Europe.

Denmark is flat and with few trees, unlike Norway which is the ideal place for fighting a guerilla war. 

But people was maybe not in the resistence, but they still resisted, my grandmom once told me how her dad commanded her the day the germans invaded to go inside, get all the silver and gold and bury it in the back yard. My neightbour told me how he was working in the fields when he saw formations of german airplanes flying over his head and how he waved at them and thought it was cool to see airplanes but his dad told him he would whip him if he ever showed respect to a Nazi. The Danish navy sank their ships so the Germans could not use them, the Danish goverment played a lot of tricks with the German supervisors to slow down progress, and many people wore the Star of David to fool the Germans, and in Israel there is some streets, monuments and schools with Danish names in honor for what the Danish fishermen and resistence did to the Jews during WWII. 

The whole Danish resistence was granted Righteous Among the Nations. The same title Oskar Schindler have. 

Hitler had support all over the world, but to say that Denmark did not resist is wrong, there was not much resistence throught violence, but plenty throught disobedience and playing tricks with the Germans, Spielberg was even going to make a movie about the Danish resistence but the boys involvet did want to sell their story to him because Spielberg was going to make changes to the story and the boys now men wanted it to be as accurate as possible. Instead Spielberg made Schindler's List.

Denmark was less touched by the war then other places, therefore less resistence. 

There were 14.000 Danish soldiers, badly equipped, 8000 of them recruits against the might of the German panzer and Blitz tactics and only 11 Danish soldiers died before the surrender, the German loss was close to the same. 

Denmark had a population of 4million, there were 230.000 German soldiers in Denmark, Denmark is a small flat country without many places to hide, any mayor group forming would have been slaughtered in seconds. 

I don't know if you are Danish, but in the school we had a lot about Danish nazists, in the early 1940 mny people thought that Nazisme was going to be the new European system and they could just as well cooperate. Many  people that joined the Nazist was socially weak people and people that got bullied that saw their chance to out of their bad lives and get ""acceptet"" and become something better. Many of them was not bad people, it was weak and sad people that took the chance, I think it's understandable. ",t3_9i0th,c0cvdfk,,True,,,0,reddit.com,False,t5_6,0,t1_c0cvazh,1,t1_c0cvdfk,kasparu,0

Not as expensive as Britain's. I think they're cheap enough?

Because it **did** start out as hardcore socialism. During the 20's and 30's Norway got to the point where many people thought there might be a socialist revolution right around the corner. Labour was a member of the communist international into the 20's. NKP remainder a political force after breaking away from Labour. After the war, NKP had a significant number of representatives for a while, and AP (Labour) dominated. From 1945 until 2009 there's only been ca. 20 years total, of 64, where AP has not had the prime minister. If you add the 5 pre-war years and the exile period during the war, you can extend that to 20 out of 74.

It's during this period that the Norwegian social services were built. Almost all of the improvements in social support networks came under AP governments and/or through massive pressure from unions.

The story in Sweden etc. is pretty much the same. For that matter: The story is pretty much the same in most of Western Europe.

Most of Europe is, at this point. Depending on how you count, there's somewhere in the region of 35-50 countries in Europe (political, geographical, economical groups often include different countries).

Norway likes being difficult, though - we've voted against EU membership twice ('73 and '94) with razor thin margins (less than a percentage point).

What's the limit? 80 million? Germany manages to do it. 60 million? The UK manages to do it. Let's say 60 million. That means you'd need to scale it 5 times. Here's the recipe: Split the US in 5 regions by population, and run those five regions separately. Then optionally have a few boards with representatives for those 5 regions to coordinate joint programs and improvements.

And before you claim that is not viable: The EU *does* manage to scale healthcare this way for *all* it's citizens, and the EU has 495 million citizens: Each member state provides care independently, but a EU citizen can get care in any EU member state that will usually get paid for by his/her country of residence.

&gt; but you're changing nothing. it's like the boy in the bedroom fantasy world. a legend in his own mind that resents when people don't understand him, even when he exhibits the qualities he despises in others.


I have a very strong central ethic in my life, and that has to do with a recognition of the power that worldviews and beliefs have over people's lives. And I see that entire socieities can be in error about certain things,and they get stuck because of those beliefs. I believe everybody ought to think critically and independently about things they see in the world around them. This is a whole frame of reference I picked up when paging through the works of european philosophers like Descarte, Kant, Nietzche, and Aristotle.

The thing that stops up the floodgates when it comes to finding solutions to problems is group-think. Reddit is a place with a constant flow of new information coming in.  And that means people can think and learn and keep reassessing things. However, it does help sometimes for someone to step up and question an old narrative which is still quite unanimously held by people. That makes people think, and it might even spawn a new trend of thought on the internet, and in the real world as well. These trends of thought very often will tend to die out after several months... but the fact that the old narrative was questioned at least once, is helpful in getting people to feel that they should reassess things in that area from time to time.

I think it's more effective to work anonymously in this manner, than as a published author. If you're an author with distinctive new ideas then people tend to group those ideas in their mind with your name. Those ideas don't get infused into society nearly as efficiently as they can when they come from a grassroots effort of many disparate bloggers and writers on the internet.

2) A lot of the wealth surrounding the European Union results from really low expenditures on national defense during the Cold War. America footed the bill for most of it, and of course, that's our own doing. When European nations began employing universal health care, they were doing so without a nasty 15%-20% of their tax income going to fund a department of defense. It's our warmongering that has precluded us from affording it. It stands to reason that Europe was able to dedicate more of their money to health care earlier than we have been able to.

As a right-wing European, I think it's usually _we_ are who are less aware of the facts - the important facts, not the little things people usually debate about, like healthcare, but the really hard stuff, like, the meaning of life and the meaning of a good life. 

Basically we equated a good life with a lot of pleasure and little pain and it's just horribly shallow and meaningless. ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_hedonism ) What I tend to admire in America that it looks more heroic, more risky, dreaming bigger and trying bigger, and of course, often failing bigger. But on the average, they - not the kids on Reddit, but the serious people - seem to think life is more than just safety and pleasure, life is more like a challenge and an adventure. And this attracts me too - only my loyalty to family, kin and land keeps me here. I often think we are hardly more than children, after all, our salaries are hardly more than pocket money to spend on little treats, we don't get to face the hard decisions of life that makes one mature and gives life a heroic undertone, winning big or losing big.

Go read some Charles Murray, f.e. In Our Hands, he opened my eyes on this subject - life is supposed to be more than whiling it away as comfortably as possible, and our systems don't reflect this important realization.

I also agree that the Rwandan genocide was due in part to Dutch colonialism, which favored the Tutsis because their facial features were thought to be more european.  However, it was also due to long-standing ethnic tensions which were stoked by a waning regime eager to stay in power by inciting racist fervor.  It's far from clear to me that without colonialism or military intervention, there would never be genocide or oppression in the world.  Even if that were clear, it wouldn't be clear that stopping military intervention right here and now is the best way to deal with the oppression and violence in the world.

But you're right - this isn't the sort of thing we'd be able to sort out on reddit.  

------

Since I've been defending the Afghanistan war elsewhere on reddit, I should also note that I'm not under any illusions as to the U.S.'s motivation in its foreign policy.  The U.S. probably didn't care much about the Afghanis - or even if it did, it *wouldn't have* if their enemies hadn't been communists.  Nevertheless, I think that we can call certain acts of foreign policy *good* even when their architects were acting for purely selfish reasons.  It may be that the only reason we helped the Afghanis fight off the Soviets was because the Soviets were communist - and not, as should have been the case, because they were brutal.  However, I still think that we were right to do so.  Similarly, even if we had excellent reasons for abandoning the Afghanis to the brutal rule of the Taliban once the Soviets were defeated - we were *wrong* to do so.

I guess I've resigned myself to the idea that governments will never act for selfless reasons - they will never take the high road.  If we ask a government to play 'world police,' you won't get much different results than you get from regular police.  Nevertheless, given that we have these world police, I'd like to see them do some good - *whatever* their motivations are for doing so.  I only wish that Rwanda had had some natural resource we desired, so that we could have intervened there and saved all those lives.  Sure, we would have been acting selfishly - but at least we'd have done some good in spite of ourselves.  I certainly wouldn't want to chastise a selfish government who, in spite of itself, rescued a race from the brink of extinction.  And this is how I feel about the Afghanistan war (the covert one in particular).  We went in and helped them only because they were the enemy of our enemy - but it was a good thing to do nonetheless.  We helped a country fight back a brutal invading force.  If only we had stuck around a bit longer to see a stable government put in place, it could have been a truly *great* thing we did.

tl:dr:  It's hard enough to influence a government to do the right thing in the first place.  Getting it to do it for the right reasons is just asking too much.",t3_9hvz3,c0cvfmx,,True,,,0,reddit.com,False,t5_6,0,t1_c0cvdrt,1,t1_c0cvfmx,Dmitrius22,0

2. Lower taxes for people making less than $50,000/year, raise taxes drastically for people making more than $500,000 a year. Try to close as many tax loopholes as possible. Or scrap the whole tax system, and create an entirely new one in which there is only a sales tax, and only luxury items are taxed. Define a luxury item as an item in any category of goods or services that is several times the average cost of that good or service. Tax progressively, so that items which are 5x-10x the average get a 10% tax, 10x-25x get a 25% tax, 25x-100x get a 50% tax, and 100x-1000x get a 70% tax.

&gt; Why, of all places in Johannesburg, the Indian location should be chosen for dumping down all kaffirs of the town, passes my comprehension. Of course, under my suggestion, the Town Council must withdraw the Kaffirs from the Location. About this mixing of the Kaffirs with the Indians I must confess I feel most strongly. I think it is very unfair to the Indian population, and it is an undue tax on even the proverbial patience of my countrymen. 

Here he complained that Indian neighbourhoods should not mix with black neighbourhoods.

&gt; You say that the magistrate's decision is unsatisfactory because it would enable a person, however unclean, to travel by a tram, **and that even the Kaffirs would be able to do so.** But the magistrate's decision is quite different. The Court declared that the Kaffirs have no legal right to travel by tram. And according to tram regulations, those in an unclean dress or in a drunken state are prohibited from boarding a tram. Thanks to the Court's decision, only clean Indians or coloured people other than Kaffirs, can now travel in the trams. 

Here he says that the court’s decision to prevent black people from using public transportation facilities is a good thing. 

Here is another one in which he compares black people to animals:

&gt; Ours is one continual struggle against a degradation sought to be inflicted upon us by the Europeans, who desire to degrade us to the level of the **raw Kaffir whose occupation is hunting, and whose sole ambition is to collect a certain number of cattle to buy a wife with and, then, pass his life in indolence and nakedness.**

Austria was likely doing this in order to grab Serbia in the same way it grabbed Bosnia and Herzegovinia about 10 years earlier (then they had been very much supported by Germany).    Russia considered Serbia to be under its umbrella and mobilized against Austria (who had treaties with Germany).   Russia had treaties with France and England didn't like Germany but was only really tied to Belgium.   Germany told Russia to back off and there's a chance that this would have happened except that there was some miscommunication.   Germany eventually declared war on Russia on August 1, pretty much assuming that Russia was not going to be a major threat.      By the end of July,  pretty much every major power in Europe was mobilizing or had mobilized.   Despite this mobilization, it took almost a month before Russia managed to get any reasonable number of troops to Tannenberg.

Frigg - She is Odin's wife and is associated with sovereignty and major female occupations (spinning, weaving, etc...). She has 12 handmaidens, who are sometimes considered separate Goddesses . Her name gives us the day Friday.

Freyja - Freyja is the Goddess of love and sexuality. Because of this, her name has survived into the Christian age. She was also said to be a user of magic, so her name is also used in some witchcraft circles.

&gt;[Opposition to NAMBLA from the larger gay rights movement was evident months after NAMBLA was founded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nambla#Ostracism)

Besides ILGA, all other major gay rights group highly disagreed with NAMBLA's advocacy of sexual relationships between adults and adolescents.  However, ILGA's association with NAMBLA concerned their agreement with the oppressive nature of consent laws concerning mutual relationships between teenagers.  Such as [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/27/us/27georgia.html) case in Georgia.

&gt;They only got kicked out after the IGLA was on the verge of losing representation at the UN.

This isn't true.  Despite ILGA's expulsion of NAMBLA in early 1994, the ILGA wasn't granted representation at the UN until 2006.  There are no gay rights group that advocates pedophilia, and in fact they are vehemently opposed to the idea of pedophilia.  Only NAMBLA considers themselves to be a gay rights group.

&gt;Most homosexual groups have two aims: “normalisation” of homosexuality and **drastically lowering the age of consent**

Citation please?

&gt;Homosexuality and paedophilia are two closely related psychological deviations.

Citation please?  And not really, because there are heterosexual pedophiles.  They're definitely not mutually inclusive.  That's like saying that being albino and being mentally handicapped are closely related because they're both genetically related.  You can have someone that's intellectually impaired that's not albino.

&gt;[Dr. Carole Jenny and her colleagues reviewed 352 medical charts, representing all of the sexually abused children seen in the emergency room or child abuse clinic of a Denver children's hospital during a one-year period (from July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1992). The molester was a gay or lesbian adult in fewer than 1% in which an adult molester could be identified](http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/HTML/facts_molestation.html)

I suggest you read that.

&gt;If you look at all societies in which homosexuality was normalised, you will notice that it was usually an older male with an under aged child. A good example of this practice was in ancient Greece.

I hardly think that the sexual practices of a society 2500 years ago is an accurate representation of modern day.  Homosexuality is basically ""normalized"" in parts of Europe, Canada, and the United States, and the Man-Child structure is no more prevalent than anywhere else.  You have absolutely no basis for making those sorts of accusations.

I see your one study and raise you 3:

[Homosexuality is natural](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_displaying_homosexual_behavior)

[Evolutionary origin of homosexuality](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13674-evolution-myths-natural-selection-cannot-explain-homosexuality.html)


&gt;[empirical evidence and professional norms do not support the idea that homosexuality is a form of mental illness or is inherently linked to psychopathology](http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_mental_health.html)

and lastly

&gt;[Originally thought by the American Psychological Association... to be a mental disorder, research into its causes, origins, and development have consequently led to its removal by the APA from its list of diagnoses and disorders](http://allpsych.com/journal/homosexuality.html)

^this is a comprehensive study into the origin of homosexuality. I suggest you read it.

&gt;so, as you can see, parental problems are at least in part responsible for your psychological deviation.

Psychological deviation implies mental disorder, and the APA hasn't classified it as such since 1973.

True,1426039897,1252359855,9,"&gt;There exists no way for a woman to make a pregnancy disappear without experiencing a financial, medical and emotional burden that is not shared with the man who contributed DNA to the pregnancy.

These are problems specific to the US, and its inhumane way of treating its own citizens. Problems that need addressing, but don't override the principle that *both* parents should have the option of consenting, or not.

You can certainly make the case that the costs of direct consequences of an unintended pregnancy should be shared. But where a person voluntarily chooses to retain an obligation they have the option of relieving themselves of, the other person shouldn't have to also bear the burden.

My example is where an unintended pregnancy occurs and the woman gives birth, and then the father locates a willing adoptive couple. If she can give away the child, then she has no obligation to keep the financial burden of raising it. If she chooses to, then she must accept responsibility for that choice.

&gt;Additionally, there exists no way for a woman to absolve herself of the pregnancy without abortion; under this proposal, a man could sign away his responsibilities while knowing that the child will be born anyway and will survive without his input or involvement. 

That would be *her* choice to do so or not. Abortion is a very real option, it being unpleasant doesn't detract from that.

&gt;This is basically a ""Male Irresponsibility Encouragement Proposal,"" which reinforces social stigmas against the importance of fatherhood.

I think this is the same level of argument as ""we can't give welfare to black women, they'll just keep having fatherless babies!""

If a woman chooses to have a child alone, whether by sperm donor, adoption, or anonymous one-night sex, that's *her* option. In two of those cases, the biological father bears no obligation. My and other men's argument is that in the third case, if the father denies consent to become a parent, the situation should be the same.

&gt;Couples should discuss pregnancy before sex. If men having sex without consenting to the potential of fatherhood is causing men problems, advocate for education that informs men that sex may result in fatherhood, and encourages them to turn down sex if they disagree with their partner's opinions on accidental pregnancy.

I have *absolutely* no disagreement with this. Sex education and birth control advocacy should be much better in the US.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#Global_incidence

Western Europe is seen as more ""sexually liberal"" than the US, yet enjoys a much lower rate of teen pregnancy **and** abortion. Sorry, your country is fucked up. :)

&gt;Consensual sex involves the tacit agreement (and preferably the explicit agreement) between two people that they will engage in an activity that carries some risk of pregnancy.
That's true. It's also tacit consent to possibly contract an STD: there's no test for HPV in men, and AIDS isn't always detected. That doesn't mean that the partner  has to be happy about having contracted the disease.

Sex isn't consent to pregnancy. That principle underlies much of the pro-choice movement's position. The same should apply to men. 

&gt;You're using the A = B/ B = C thing again here.

I'm sorry Saydrah, but this is the third time you've used this construction, and I don't believe it applies to any of them. If you want to describe how my argument fails in modal logic, please be my guest. But I am drawing comparisons that are not merely rhetorical. If there's a flaw in my reasoning, you'll need to be specific.

&gt;I stated that suffering should not be inflicted on a child, stacking the deck against it from birth, because the father feels like abdicating his responsibilities to his child. 

This is an example of arguing from maternalism, as I described above.

If a woman carries an unintended child to term, and keeps the child when she has the option of placing it with an adoptive family, then she has made both the choice to allow that child to exist (it didn't have to) and retain the burden of carrying for it (she doesn't have to). The responsibility to provide for it must then lie with her.

There should *be* no responsibility to a child a man never consented to be the father of.

Again, if there exist children suffering financially, and society as a whole has a problem with that, then society as a whole should address it, rather than compelling men to finance women's voluntary choices.

&gt;What about the pragmatic, real-world choice to have sex, knowing it might create a baby? If a man made that choice, he can be expected to step up financially, to a reasonable degree.
""If a woman made that choice, she can be expected to step up and bear the child.""

It's the same thing. Women do not have to keep an unintended child. Men have the right to the same degree choice.

&gt;The father and mother both had a right to decline to participate in the activity that led to the birth of this child.
Again trying to equate sex with consent to parenthood. ""You play, you pay"", again, from the Christian fundamentalist handbook. And in actuality, making all women to be prostitutes. You have sex, you pay afterwards if she [lies about the birth control](http://forum.freeadvice.com/child-custody-visitation-37/ex-lied-about-taking-birth-control-65569.html) or [sabotaged](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control_sabotage) it. She wants a baby, and can force a man to pay for her lifestyle decision *merely by seducing him into sex*.

Doesn't that seem something like financial rape?

Actually, I'm glad I raised that point. Feminists, and here rightly I think, assert that a woman *has the right to withdraw consent to sex at any point*. Even if the man is nearing climax, she has the right to tell him to stop and get off. If he does not, he's committing sexual assault.
The corollary is that *men have the right to withdraw consent to the effects of sex*. Just because a man had an orgasm in a willing woman (something I think you'll agree men are powerfully driven to do, and women don't have much trouble finding men who will do it), doesn't mean he shouldn't be able to say no to becoming a father, even if the woman wants to ""continue the process"".
&gt;I disagree with the implication that abortion is preferable to single parenthood.
That's your belief perhaps, but should have no bearing on the legal framework for our society. Abortion exists as an option. NOT having one, as from my example above, is actively choosing not to turn away from driving into the wall. Choosing to do so then means the burden rests on the person who decided to keep going.

&gt;I don't think the right to be an irresponsible parent is more important than a child's right to exist without poverty.

Is the sperm donor an ""irresponsible parent""? A man who's consenting to sex, and only sex, shouldn't be viewed as much different. If a pregnancy occurs, he should have the *choice* to walk away, or assert his parental rights and obligations. Just like the woman can.
&gt;But without that safety net in place, intelligent child support reform is needed, but there is not a sufficient argument for paternal abdication.

Protecting a man's right to choose could help spur that reform, and improvements to welfare.

Actually, given the insane debate around healthcare in your country, I wouldn't be optimistic. :(

However, this discussion *doesn't only apply to the USA*, and it's ethnocentric to assume that the US is the only country that matters. This is a human rights issue, that needs to be brought up around the world.  Men should have the right to say ""no"" to parenthood, just as a woman does.

The IGLA is one of the biggest international gay groups. You still cannot explain to me why they were allowed to join. The only conclusion is that the IGLA condones the view of NAMBLA.

&gt; Despite ILGA's expulsion of NAMBLA in early 1994, the ILGA wasn't granted representation at the UN until 2006.

The IGLA achieved consultativestatus in 1993. A senator proposed a bill that would zero funding for the UN if they approved the IGLA. Here is a quote from WP:

&gt; Republican Senator Jesse Helms proposed a bill to withhold $119 million in U.N. contributions until U.S. President Bill Clinton could certify that ""no UN agency grants any official status, accreditation, or recognition to any organization which promotes, condones, or seeks the legalization of pedophilia, that is, the sexual abuse of children"". The bill was unanimously approved by Congress and signed into law by Clinton in April 1994.

So, yes it is true.

&gt; Citation please?

So you are claiming that homosexual organisations do not want to lower the age of sexual consent?

&gt; Dr. Carole Jenny and her colleagues reviewed 352 medical charts, representing all of the sexually abused children seen in the emergency room or child abuse clinic of a Denver children's hospital during a one-year period (from July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1992). The molester was a gay or lesbian adult in fewer than 1% in which an adult molester could be identified

Per definition, any male that sodomise a male boy is homosexual. This study makes use of some very selective language.

&gt; Homosexuality is basically ""normalized"" in parts of Europe, Canada, and the United States, and the Man-Child structure is no more prevalent than anywhere else. You have absolutely no basis for making those sorts of accusations.

That is because it is still illegal in most countries to have intercourse with young males. This is another reason why Gay organisations are struggling against the “oppressive age of consent” laws.
A lot of homosexuals in these countries travel to third world countries (such as Sri Lanka) to have sexual intercourse with young boys.

&gt; Homosexuality is natural


Ahh… Another false argument. Higher animals (such as anthropoids and humans) have a large component of learning sexual behaviour. Baboons in captivity for example get a lot of sexual deviations. They may even attempt intercourse with animals from different species. Surely you are not advocating that bestiality is normal?

For lower animals where the hereditarianism drive is stronger, apparent homosexual acts would usually occur because they are not capable of distinguishing between different sexes. There is actually a Spanish doctor that did quite interesting research in this regard (forgot his name). 

&gt; empirical evidence and professional norms do not support the idea that homosexuality is a form of mental illness or is inherently linked to psychopathology

Really? [These]( www.narth.com) psychologists beg to differ.

&gt; ^this is a comprehensive study into the origin of homosexuality. I suggest you read it.

&gt;An obvious danger attending all associations of men connected by secret obligations, springs from their susceptibility to abuse in being converted into engines for the overthrow or the control of established governments. So soon was the apprehension of this excited in Europe by Freemasonry, that many of the absolute monarchies took early measures to guard against its spread within their limits. Rome, Naples, Portugal, Spain and Russia made participation in it a capital offense. Other governments more cautiously confined themselves to efforts to control it by a rigid system of supervision. in Great Britain, the endeavor of government has been to neutralize its power to harm, by entering into it and by placing trust worthy members of the royal family at its head. Yet even with all these precautions and prohibitions, it is believed that in France at the period of the revolution, and in Italy within the present century, much of the insurrectionary spirit of the time was fostered, if not in Masonic Lodges, at least in associations bearing a close affinity to them in all essential particulars.

Freenet is a great network for censorship-resistant filesharing and data storage, but the freesite aspect isn't terribly great. Freenet is very, very powerful in terms of censorship-resistance. Once inserted, files will not be removed until they have been completely unused for a matter of years, and through the network, it's impossible to do something like a DoS to remove access to a file.

If you're into that sort of anonymity network (filesharing, censorship-resistance) I recommend taking a look at [GNUnet](https://gnunet.org). Like Freenet, it can do P2P and F2F filesharing, and supports the same sort of content migration that Freenet does. Unlike freenet, it has a modular transport layer, so you can communicate over TCP, UDP, SMTP (yes, you read that right) and HTTP by default. Transports for 802.11 and maybe more firewall-dodging things like DNS and ICMP are coming soon.

Everyone should also check out [Tor](https://torproject.org) and [I2P](http://i2p2.de), primarily outproxy and inproxy networks respectively. That means you can use Tor to anonymously go to, say, Reddit, but you could use I2P to host a version of Reddit anonymously (note the people going to that would still be anonymous).

There is only freedom of speech if there is freedom of anonymous speech. The founders of the United States knew this, which is why they published their pamphlets anonymously -- protecting them from the British Crown and helping to establish a democratic government. The current leaders in government in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, the People's Republic of China, and almost every other government in the world know this -- this is why they have been using fearmongering and scapegoats (like terrorism, drug dealing, and child porn) to steadily and stealthily limit anonymity and hence, freedom of speech, on the internet.

**Don't** let our generation be the last to experience the wonder that is free speech on the internet. **Don't** let power-hungry and $$-eyed politicos and corporations strip away **your** rights, and your children's rights, for the sake of their wallets. Privacy-enhancing technologies have the power to take your rights back and keep them yours, at least for now.

There is ample proof that Gandhi said and did some extremely racist things. So to say that he was racist against blacks is the truth. Maybe he changed later in life – but you have not given any evidence of that. 

&gt; affir comes from kafir, which is an arabic term for those who don't follow islam [or perhaps those who are jewish/christian only, w/e] and so in this context it makes no sense at all, it's not even a bad word -- it didn't even describe blacks!""

The word is a lot more offensive than the word Nigger. We can discuss this verbatim but the fact remains that it is. Maybe it is not just the root with the word – but the negative stereotype associated with the word “kaffir” is far worse than the American word “nigger”.

(Many “Indians” in South Africa were Muslim btw.)

&gt; what newspaper (that too, incorrectly).

AFAIK, the name of the newspaper changed. This may make sense since the structure of the government changed (South Africa only came to existence after 1900. Before that it was separate colonies/republics). I am not 100% sure of this but you should look it up.

&gt; The quotes appeared in letters to some medical officer, and also in the Indian opinion.

Yes. And one of those quotes comes from a public speech he made in Bombay. But I don’t know what the purpose of this comment of yours is. The fact of the matter is that he made racist remarks and it is properly sourced.

&gt; Are you really telling me this? Have you lost your mind? Do you not think that a man like MLK would perchance spend some time to get to know what sort of person he is modeling some of his efforts off of?

Maybe, maybe not. We today have the hindsight of half a century of research and the internet. I doubt that MLK subscribed to the Indian Opinion. AFAIK, they did not deliver to the USA.

&gt; If Gandhi sincerely held a belief that blacks were inferior to Indians/others all his life, he would've put that in writing.

Uhm… He did put it in writing in the Indian Opinion!

&gt; Not once did he say anything of the sort after he left SA for India.

Gandhi made the following statement in a public speech in Bombay:

&gt; Ours is one continual struggle against a degradation sought to be inflicted upon us by the Europeans, who desire to degrade us to the level of the raw Kaffir whose occupation is hunting, and whose sole ambition is to collect a certain number of cattle to buy a wife with and, then, pass his life in indolence and nakedness.

&gt; is early remarks are not kind, and certainly can be construed as racist.

His early remarks cannot be “construed” as racist, they were racist. 

&gt; nderdeveloped opinions on Gandhi and yet you seem so damn confident.

I have a high regard for Gandhi. But that does not mean that I am going to ignore his small imperfections (which are negligible when compared to the rest of his life) and raise him to the level of a saint. He was only human after all (with human characteristics). 

&gt; you want to go in this no holds barred one-way blasting on gandhi.

No. I am just illuminating a lot of people here on this thread that they have a one dimensional view of Gandhi. 

&gt; i'm just contending that he is a complex man,

That is what I also argue. 

&gt; and that we cannot label him a racist.

He was a racist (that is a fact). But how many other people were also racist? 

What do you remember Hendry Ford for? He was racist yet he did amazingly good work. The same for many other people. People are not just these saints that did everything good. Wernher von Braun used Jewish Slave labour but without his Saturn rockets the moonlanding would not have happened. James Watson helped figure out the helix structure for DNA but he thinks black people are stupid. Most of the founding fathers also held a low opinion of black people. 

You unfortunately see the world in black and white. A person can be both racist and accomplish great things in his life.

I won't go too far into what I took away from those experiences. I'll only say that kids working isn't all its made out to be.

When I was younger, fast food restaurants were always staffed by teenagers. Now you have to drive into the country before you see that. The result? service is way better now with the immigrants that one usually sees. I also used to see local yokel teenagers working at the amusement parks in the summer. Now I usually Eastern European college students instead. The result? Christ, it is so much nicer to go to an amusement park these days.

&gt;Well, exactly. That is why you'd blame the League of Nations: A shit idea from the start.

Not a shit idea, a good first attempt and an admirable one that they even attempted this.  Humanity is not lost, we build from mistakes and make successive improvements.

&gt;Because France and Britain weren't confident about beating back Germany and being able to keep their Empires secure in the process

The French accepted the British thesis preached ever since Locarno that they were in less danger if they simply withdrew behind the Rhine.  Even in 1938 they didn't fear defeat if it came to war.  Gamelin was always sure that the Democratic powers would win a war against Germany, but what would be the point of war?  This was the reason that prevented French action since 1923 and which prevented it leading up to the Munich agreement.  

Even if Germany was defeated by the French and British at this point, it would still be there, still a great and powerful nation, still angry over Versaille.

They believed that they couldn't stop German expansion in Eastern Europe, as well Germany couldn't invade France.  They had a firm and well-founded belief that the Maginot line would hold.


&gt;The idea that Germany didn't want a war with France though is wrong.

The Germans built the massive and expensive Siegfried line for the same reasons that the French built the Maginot line.  Neither wanted war with each other and these were defensive positions to safeguard each side.  

Hitler never even demanded the return of Alsace from France and he didn't want to challenge the British empire.  On the flip side he and the rest of Germany couldn't back down from getting Danzig back from Poland.

If Hitler wanted the French destroyed, why didn't he attempt kill or deport French citizens from French territory in order to gain Lebensraum?  

The facts are quite clear that Hitler had no ambitions of war against France or the UK, this is just historical fact.

* Ok, so public schools in Europe work better than ours. So what? If anything, it tells us to compare our system, and see what is different. You would probably find out the major difference is the curriculum. We just have shitty ones. We keep lowering our standards to get more people to graduate, an obviously flawed concept.

Nobody panicked about the Jews, there was no popular support for the final solution. This was the brainchild of the Nazi leadership, mainly from the mythological race-cult of Himmlers SS. The German public was mostly shielded from the ugly truth.

If you are asking instead why the Nazi leadership went for the final solution. There I have no definitive answer. But my guess is they wouldn't have stopped with the Jews. They were certainly going to terminate the Roma and Sindhi and after that they would have worked Slavic ethnicities to death. Maybe the Jews were just singled out because they made a good target. You know a people without land, with different culture, unwelcome but successful.

A few other things you are dead wrong about: 

Hitler was not seen as weak by his generals. Those that opposed him, found him too radical and a danger to the country. 

Yes Hitler was no born artist or architect (like he wanted to be) but he could probably draw better than you. He also had not much of a military career in WW1. But he certainly wasn't a know nothing puppet. He was good in politics, foreign and domestic. The German public was behind him most of the time and he played all the foreign leaders of Europe before the war. He got a lot of his victories without ever firing a shot.

There was not much public support for the war against Poland, so he devised a false flag operation and only ""shot back after they attacked"" you know.

True,1426040223,1252391848,0,"I would hesitate to say ""right,"" but I think the death penalty is justified in a few VERY rare types of cases.  Also keep in mind that I'm not used to talking about these issues, so if there is anything in my discussion that's ambiguous or poorly explained tell me and I'll try my best to make it clear.

I think the death penalty CAN be a deterrent, but because the time someone is on death row in this country is so long (and hence the punishment is so distant in the mind of a criminal) it doesn't really work. That, and, we don't have public executions where all the citizens used to gather 'round and watch the bad guy get executed and marvel at the power of the state.  Even if, however, the death penalty could be made into an effective deterrent, I still don't think it would be justified.  The reason I noted all the above is that it could be a positive (though unintended) side effect in the cases I do support the death penalty.

Now, the times I would (in principle, at least) support the death penalty.  I can't think of any crime that is common in the United States that would merit the death penalty.  I don't think life is at all times sacred or anything, I just think that the pro-death penalty arguments that float around in the US zeitgeist don't carry any water.  These arguments are:
""It deters crime.""
Well, I think it could, but it doesn't.  At least not here.  And even if it did, that's not very satisfying to me.  I'm sure horrific torture would also deter crime, but I wouldn't condone that for the same reason I wouldn't condone the death penalty.
""It serves as a stamp of society's disapproval of especially repugnant acts.""
Right, well, see above.  And I think that more circumscribed use of life in prison would accomplish that anyway.
""It's just/right/fair/etc.""
I can understand this sentiment, but I don't think it justifies the death penalty.  Something I haven't really addressed-that in a way underscores this argument-is differing conceptions of what our justice system ought to do.  Reform criminals? Well, the American justice system sure as hell does not do that to begin with, but even if that's one of our nominal goals, the death penalty wouldn't do that for obvious reasons.  Isolate them/make society safer by their absence?  Death penalty would do that, but it's a bit extreme.  Serve ""justice"" or redress some cosmic imbalance in the favor or the righteous?  Well, I was never big on metaphysical things myself, so this doesn't exactly grab me.  I have to admit, though, that certain things intuitively seem ""fair.""  But that's what scares me.  If our justice system was based around avenging wrongs and balancing out injustices, it would be bloody and in many ways barbaric.  That, and probably chaotic.  When I think retributive justice, I think medieval europe, or more contemporarily, Cultural Revolution era China, where ""landlords"" and whoever else were subjected to horrific punishments.  When I look at the chaos of Cultural Revolution China, it strikes me that the death penalty shouldn't exist perhaps BECAUSE it is an outlet for our worst impulses.  Maybe the state SHOULD restrain us in this regard.  The question also arises in a retributive system like this how exactly one measures up a punishment to a crime.  Is the death penalty only for killers, or for other people too?  I don't think anyone can come up with any meaningful way of computing what exactly is a ""fair"" or ""just"" punishment for the galaxy of crimes that exist in actual society and not just normatively.  I'm getting bogged down, though, and I'll set ""justice"" and ""what's fair"" aside for the moment so I can get to my point.

I think the death penalty is justified, in theory at least, in cases of war crimes or genocide.  These are crimes that don't just transgress our notions of justice or defy the will of the state, they totally upend and transcend it (wordy and awkward sentence, I know, but not sure how to express this).  In short, they go beyond what any normal criminal can do and I think it's silly to even put them in the same category.  For them a different level of punishment I think is merited, one that is the maximum that a society can offer.  Genocide/war crimes so completely destroy the fabric of the society that punishing them within the bounds of the laws society had set up for normal criminals would seem hollow.  There are also potential practical concerns: if Hitler were alive and had been tried and sentenced to life in prison, he may not, in total isolation be able to lead his political movement, but his existence is both a rallying point and a source of legitimacy for that movement.  So in a way, I guess I DO support the whole ""marker of society's disapproval"" but only in the most extreme cases - that is, if a political movement threatens to overturn the political order and exterminate whole groups of people.  Only then is it permissible to grant that movement and whatever people it is instantiated in the ultimate marker of illegitimacy and unacceptability.  

That being said, there are problems with my view.  Victor's justice is one of them, of course; I can't imagine a situation in the current world in which this would happen without some ulterior political (or geopolitical) motive, just like our trials of Japanese and German admirals and Air commanders who did basically the same thing we did.  

There's also the question of whether of how much people can be accountable for war crimes if they are operating in a ""total system"" as David Chandler would put it.  That is, a system in which you are forced to cooperate and do horrible things under threat of death, but apparently do these of your own volition.  It's difficult to adjudicate guilt in a situation like that.  I'm thinking SS officers and Khmer Rouge prison guards.  I'm also reminded of Arendt's ""Eichmann in Jerusalem.""  Guilt of a crime can be a pretty tricky thing, and especially with war crimes, not as black and white as we would want it to be.  Anyway, that's my piece, I hope it wasn't too boring.  I probably also should've read some of the other posts first before I wrote mine, but I was just so excited by the topic that I dived in.  Bon appetit.

True,1426040247,1252392840,5,"Capsule summary, timeline is only approximate and a few events may be out of order:

* Israel was an ancient kingdom.

* The Romans conquered it, just as they did much of the Western world.

* The Jewish population, unlike the population of most other Roman provinces, had serious problems with a number of characteristics of the Roman Empire -- for example, the deification of dead Roman Emperors.

* This eventually led to a series of major revolts that were bloodily put down by the Romans.  Eventually the Romans decided that Judaism was causing way more revolutions than it was worth and prohibited the religion from being practiced; most Jews fled Israel.

* About 1400 years ago, the Muslims conquered the area, and allowed Jews to once again live openly in the area, but not to establish a Jewish state.  This wouldn't live up to modern standards of religious tolerance, but it was a lot better than what was going on in Christian Europe.

* Jews in Western Europe, since their religion clashed with Christianity, were generally treated very poorly (finally culminating in the Holocaust).  Until Cromwell came to power in England, they were banned from living in England.  At many times in various places they were banned from owning property.  By and large, they were treated better by the Muslims.

* Around the late 1800s, a small number of Jewish settlers re-settled in Palestine, with the intent of re-establishing settlements.  [Baron Edmond James de Rothschild](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Edmond_James_de_Rothschild) is an important early patron; the settlements he sponsored were almost feudal in nature, with himself as head.  Over the next few decades, Jews would purchase land and build settlements; they were still by far the minority in the region.

* Around World War I, the British and other Western powers made a number of rather vague and in some cases outright contradictory promises as to land in the Middle East.  This led to a great deal of Arab resentment against the British for parceling out chunks of land.

* Policies by Jewish landowners who would not hire Muslim Arab laborers (some early settlements were inspired by then-popular communist sentiment, which valued not having others work the land for oneself, in addition to language and cultural barriers) let to protests from Muslims.

* During a particularly ardent period of German nationalism, the Nazi Party plays off religious concerns (and economic concerns -- this was the Great Depression and competition for jobs was fierce).  The Nazi Party grows in power and [ultimately proposes exiling Germany's Jewish population to Madagascar](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Madagascar_plan), a not particularly appealing chunk of land.  Madagascar was claimed by France, and France, who had just fought a bitter World War I with Germany, was not at all interested in helping Germany (much less taking in a bunch of Jews, who weren't necessarily liked much in France, either).  The failure of this plan meant that Germany settled on an even more drastic approach -- the [Final Solution](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Final_Solution).

* The many Jewish refugees from World War II are settled predominantly in refugee camps established in Palestine.  This appeals to a number of parties.  To many Jews, it could be viewed as fulfilling a prophecy; Zionists certainly approved, and had been lobbying receptive high-ranking US officials for some time to try to obtain support.  It was billed as a safe place, where Jews need not fear another Holocaust.  To Western Europe's Christendom, which had never liked Jews much, this meant an opportunity to get rid of Jews (ironically enough, the mass expulsion of Jews to a not-particularly-appealing chunk of land mirrored in many ways what the Nazis had originally intended with the Madagascar Plan).  The United States was a bit less irritable about Jews than some European countries, but even the US was quite unenthusiastic about the prospect of taking in masses of penniless refugees.  King Abdullah of Jordan, quite aware of Zionist sentiment and alarmed by the large numbers of refugees, [protests to the United States](http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/kabd_eng.html).

* The British Mandate of Palestine includes a number of guarantees, including a (smaller than today, but in roughly the same place) rough allocation of land for Jews, and certain requirements that the needs of both Palestinians and Jews be met.  There is friction over the British requirements; various paramilitary Arab groups and Israeli groups show up ([Irgun](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Irgun) is an example of one such Jewish organization).

* Violence steadily increases, with Arab Muslims attacking Jews and Jews attacking Arab Muslims Muslims.  There are many causes -- concerns over employment, the desire of some Jews to fully re-establish Greater Israel (which was significantly larger than the land allocation from the British), religious disagreements, etc.  This finally explodes into outright fighting in 1948.  The Muslims lose badly and are expelled or flee before advancing armies.

* Israel does not allow Muslims to return; Israel appropriates or destroys a number of Muslim settlements to discourage Muslims from coming back to their homes.  Muslims take grave issue with this.

* Israel [acquires a nuclear arsenal](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_and_Israel).  This helps alleviate some concerns of Israel over its smaller number of people than surrounding Arab Muslim nations.

* In 1967, a number of Arab nations had interest in attacking or seriously threatening Israel in the name of the Palestinians.  They had never recognized Israel as a nation following the Jewish triumph over the Arabs.  Some were not thrilled with having Palestinian refugees living in their countries; some were sympathetic to those Palestinians who had lost their homes, land, and property, some were interested in expanding their own borders.  Egypt, Jordan, and Syria moved forces up to the border and began acting threateningly.  Israel attacks preemptively, and using its superior military hardware and training, wipes out the Arab forces, and captures large chunks of those nations -- the West Bank, Golan Heights, and Sinai, as well as control of Jerusalem.  One major problem is that not all Palestinian inhabitants fled when those areas were conquered; while those who did were not allowed to return, the remaining ones in what became known as the Occupied Territories shifted the population in the area to become more strongly Arab Muslim.

* Egypt attacks Israel, trying to get Sinai back.  Egypt loses.  

* Egypt finally signs a deal in which Israel returns Sinai in return for Egypt granting peace and recognizing Israel as a nation and not trying to give Israel's land to the Palestinians.

* Where possible, Arab Muslims are moved into the Occupied Territories; in theory, these could be used as bargaining cards in the future, and will simultaneously reduce the Arab Muslim portion of the population.  Arab Muslims have a significantly higher birthrate than do Jews, which is a source of serious long-term concern for Israel's remaining a Jewish state.  To help address these concerns, Israel adopts the [Law of Return](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Law_of_Return), allowing any Jew in the world to immigrate to Israel and become an Israeli citizen.  For the same reason, the [Palestinian right of return](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Palestinian_right_of_return) is proposed by Palestinians (but, not surprisingly, not accepted by Israel).

* A number of Arab Muslims in the area start waging a guerrilla war against Israel.  Terrorism and bombings ensue.

* The Israeli military requires all Jews (but not Muslims) to serve in the military to ensure that in any future uprising, Jews will probably have the upper hand.

True,1426040365,1252401694,1,"I dont think its that absurd.  I can see the difference between coerced and voluntary giving.

The thing is that if I didn't like paying local taxes then I could move, totally freely, to other places with different tax rates which are spent on different things.  I live in the UK but I can move and work freely anywhere in Europe and most other places would accept me as an immigrant.  If you live in the states you can move from state to state to find somewhere that suits you in terms of local tax rates or emigrate if no where there suits you.

So really, the taxes I pay are pretty voluntary.

Also, on top of my taxes I occasionally give to charities.  Most people do.  So clearly Im not only happy with ""giving"" taxes but willing to give more on top.

If people dont want to pay taxes then its easy:  Move.  A lot of people who don’t like paying taxes (the rich) so they ""move"" offshore.  Many don’t even leave the country; they just do the paper work.  That’s a luxury affordable to them because they are rich, for normal people it’s the same but you have to actually do the moving.

Do you really object to how **most** of your taxes are spent?  I object to my donations to charity being used for things like un-sustainable aid and projects that will not survive global warming.  That said, I still donate because I like how the rest is spent and I accept not being able to have everything I want.

It’s the same with taxes.  I didn’t like paying for the invasion of Iraq (although now we are there I think we need to stay…).  I do like how 80%+ of my taxes are spent (healthcare, welfare, education, security etc).  So I pay.

If I liked another charity better I would donate to them.  If I liked another countries tax and spend policies better I would move.

As an added bonus, every 6 (or so) years I get a say in how my taxes are spent and how much they cost.  That makes staying where I am and continuing to pay even more voluntary.

So No, technically paying taxes is not totally voluntary but it is much less coerced than people like to pretend and most people, even if they had absolute power to setup the tax system as they liked would build something very similar to what we have.

True,1426040392,1252409207,-13,"It's totally not true that all it takes is money. Do you think a nerd with with some neat figures on the bank account suddenly stops being a nerd?

I had periods in my time, when compared to my peers - poor college students in Eastern Europe - I was relatively rich. I've been the one who bought the drinks and wore the Replay jeans. Still I was usually girlless and the reason is simple. See, most folks have an attitude that they want to be alpha males and within this group money counts, because money helps them express their alphahood. 

But if you, like me, belong to those people who don't give a damn about alphahood, then money doesn't count. Replay jeans and buying the drinks may sound like alpha, but in reality I was just the nerd who just happened to buy some Replay jeans because people told me I should and I thought why not, and I just happened to buy the drinks with pretty much the same attitude one volunteers to do the dishes: just because someone has to do it.

There is a high chance that most girlless young male Redditors are of the same nerdy, non-alpha types. Money will _not_ help them, they will be the same type.

If I would be uber-rich, for example, if owned, say, a hundred million dollars, I would still not buy a Ferrari because I just don't see any point in it. I would simply go everywhere with a cab, that's more comfortable. And if I felt I'm getting fat, I'd still put on my sports shoes and simply walk everywhere in order to lose weight. And I still wouldn't get a haircut more often than every 3 months because it bores me. So I wouldn't be awesome at all, no matter how much money I would have. At the end of the day, I'd still not look alpha at all, because alpha has less to do with money and more with attitude or a desire to be alpha, of which I have none.

Money will _perhaps_ help after 35-40, because 30-35 years old women might be more serious and might care less about the alpha attitude and more about a comfy house. I don't know - I'm 31, I'm mostly going for 25-28 years old women and my experience is that they still in the age where they expect you to be alpha, they still want to go to fucking disco to dance to some boring music (why don't girls like really exciting music like KMFDM? ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKxosfl1E2g )  ) and still would want you to be the alpha male with whom they can impress their friends with, perhaps a few years more and it will change, but it had not yet.

It's not pretty but it is the reality of the situation. Israel has no wish to share the land, so they're quietly encroaching on Palestinian territory bit by bit, year by year. The only reason they haven't completely wiped out the Palestinians already is because doing so would raise an international uproar.

Where the hell did you get that from?

I said I don't trust authority. honestly I don't know much about economics, but I know political philosophy. It seems to me that capitalism is practically unsustainable. It creates a group of people, and it tends to be small, who control a massive amount of world resources. Those people cannot help, by virtue of human nature, but to persue an agenda that benefits them at the expense of their social inferiors. Government, being comprised only of mere humans, cannot help but be corrupted by the money and influence of the capitalist over-class. I think regulation can be good and my proof is the resilience of the European economy, and their high quality of life. 

I like freedom, but I recognize it has limist. It is not the only virtue. It must, in society, be balanced against equality and fraternity. You seem to equate freedom with personal property rights and therefore ordaining capitalism. Is there no right higher than than the right to property? What about the right to life? 

&gt;Do I prefer everyone being comfortable and entitled to use violence. People can use violence now, but they have to answer for it. Government typically does not. This is why you hear about all those shooting sprees at gun shows!

I am not sure I disagree with you. Do you think all government is unnecessary? I think if some government is necessary (roads and bridges at the least) it must collect taxes, or else fund itself some other way. Would it not then need some mechanism of funding? Would it not then need some means of enforcement?

True,1426040485,1252420606,1,"It is hard to understand what you are asking.

Fox news represents the extreme right wing of the political continuum of the United States. On a continuum, where the most conservative is represented at 100% and the most liberal represented at 0%, then would you believe that Fox News placed (around 4 years ago, when it was still somewhat muzzled) inside the ninetieth percentile? The most liberal news network in the country was PBS in the mid 40's. Most of the news stations in our country are moderately politically leaning.  Most Americans don't realize that our definition of liberal is more in line with Europe's definitions of a moderate.

It seems obvious that the views and policy positions of the Republican party are mirrored by Fox News. I'm going to assume you don't want me to provide answers on how we know those under the persuasion of the Republican ideology identify with positions taken by Fox News. This makes your question a lot more complex, because it changes the question. As I take it, you are asking if Fox News really has such a persuasive influence on such a large number of citizens.

To understand this you must understand that the majority of people in the US--and indeed the world--do not keep up with current affairs. People determine that their votes are worthless. When they decide their votes are worthless, then they are not motivated to inform themselves on an issue before a vote. When this happens, they must find an less expensive (in terms of time and energy) means of arriving at a decision when voting. They fall back on 'cues,' which are mental shortcuts they can take to show that a particular selection meets their preferred criteria. Therefore, an uninformed liberal voter--knowing nothing about either candidate--will vote for Bill Clinton over George H. W. Bush, because of the shortcut following his name; ""-D"" for Democrat.

Its difficult to show you evidence such as a link, because this understanding has been arrived at incrementally. Through a variety of evidence, it has been shown that people are retarded, that they rely on cues (to activate mental pathways called schemas), that some members are engaged, and that these member act as discussion leaders/opinion leaders.",t3_9i6o6,c0cwfva,,True,,,0,reddit.com,False,t5_6,0,t1_c0cweow,1,t1_c0cwfva,[deleted],0

And the USA is the living example of that. Wait, nevermind.

&gt; Bush and Co did this, now they're out

Damage done without any means to stop them anyways. The democratic party is now catering to different corporations.

""Choose your dictatorship"" is still dictatorship.

&gt; The rich and powerful will always have power by definition. The trick is to make sure they compete with each other as much as possible toward the betterment of society.

This never worked. The country that allows for the wildest competition turns out to be the one with the most abuse from the riches and the most sold out state out of the rich countries. Even within Europe, this is visible: the more economically liberal countries are slightly more sold out to the rich class.

&gt; In a system where one group of the rich can gather an unassailable stranglehold on the voting process they will no longer need to compete and will simply focus on maintaining their own power base at the expense of everyone else.

Who said first-class citizens are expected to be the richest, and they're just one group of the rich? Besides, they could be made not rich at all; in fact since we're discussing utopias here, I could toss a maximum amount of wealth in to prevent this.

&gt; a violent purge of families with children to settle them back into despair (ahem, Enforcement of the Law, thirds do not deserve children, as they are subhuman)

Never said that. I've said heavy fines, and maybe neutering (esp. in the case of third-class citizens for life), not kill that illegal kid.

&gt; To recap; The firsts become the core, the seconds become the shield, the thirds become the cattle they feed upon.

The smartest/most useful become the core, normal people become the mass, and the criminal scum repay their damage to the upper two by serving them. I fail to see any issues with this.

&gt; If you limit money, it will cease to be the coin they use. How does 'thirds under your direct control' as a currency grab you?

Thirds are only under the direct control of the state. And of course, a limit on wealth will also affect the appraised of all of their private goods, which are easy to track because all they can own is:

1. Leased land
2. Physical objects
3. Shares in a single cooperative corporation where they must have a working position

Yes, you can, by installing electronic speed limiters built in right in their engine management systems.

To avoid the charges you then have to play the Ryanair game.

- First, check in online, for both the outbound and return flight before you leave. Checking in at the airport costs £40pp.

- Ensure you have hand luggage with the exact maximum dimensions and just take this. They charge for putting luggage in the hold, but hand luggage (cary on) is free.

- Buy a couple of drinks and a sandwich in the airport lounge (after security or it is confiscated)  so you don't have to pay stupid money onboard.

You can even avoid card handling fees if you have a Visa Electron card. These are hard to get hold of, but some banks to offer them if you ask. Google should point you in the right direction.

The $15 flight US to EU is before taxes. You will probably pay $100 after taxes. Plus on an 8 hour flight you will have to buy in flight refreshments, and there are suggestions they will start charging to use the toilet too.

True,1426040767,1252437067,1,"I don't know all the foreign policy rationale behind that.  The US currently gives Israel $3B in military aid per year.  It's not truly massive compared to the total budget of Israel or the US, though it is a significant chunk of cash, and it is by far the largest amount of foreign aid given any nation by the US.

I can guess at a few points; at one point in time, Israel was strategically useful as an advance point against the Soviet Union.  (Today, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the existence of US military bases in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, access to Turkey, and so forth would seem to me to greatly reduce this value.)

There is a certain amount of political support that Israel gets in the US, both from concern over the Holocaust and wanting to help set things right and the fact that most people in the United States grow up in a Christian environment.  The first half of the Christian religious book essentially amounts to a quite nationalist set of writings belonging to the ancient kingdom of Israel.  The typical stuff for a country of the time -- divine support for its rulers, its enemies will be crushed, its people are favored by patron gods, etc, etc, but many US residents are still brought up with it as the direct word of the creator of the universe.  [Chick tracts](http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/1055/1055_01.asp?wpc=1055_01.asp&amp;wpp=a) form an extreme example.  That leads to things like [CUFI](http://www.cufi.org/site/PageServer) as well as a general degree of political support:

&gt;The Bible commands us to pray for the peace of Jerusalem (Psalm 122:6), to speak out for Zion’s sake (Isaiah 62:1), to be watchmen on the walls of Jerusalem (Isaiah 62:6) and to bless the Jewish people (Genesis 12:3). These and so many other verses of the Bible that have one overriding message-- as Christians we have a Biblical obligation to defend Israel and the Jewish people in their time of need.

Early Zionists aimed for influencing officials (and particularly Jewish officials) in the United States to gain support; the US was influential, didn't have nearly the same negative feelings about Jews that much of the West did, didn't have some political ties to the Arabs that the UK did, etc.  Israel today still takes a similar approach.  It tries to encourage Jewish US citizens to live in Israel for some time to build up bonds and then support Israel in the future.  It has a well-organized and effective lobby; you may notice the 2008 US Presidential candidates going to great lengths at AIPAC speeches to make assurances of a continued special relationship with Israel.  It's not typical for any other foreign country to receive such guarantees during candidacy.  Palestine, having little money and few people with family ties in the US, doesn't have nearly the same resources.  Jewish Israelis (particularly those from a European background) have many more cultural commonalities with US residents than do Palestinians.

None of these points stand alone, but they'd all be factors that would help Israel obtain more support than would Palestine.",t3_9i34k,c0cwrg1,,False,,,0,worldnews,False,t5_2qh13,0,t1_c0cwgk4,1,t1_c0cwrg1,zubzub2,0

It's right up there with The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  The [Wikipeida article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazar#Alleged_Khazar_ancestry_of_Ashkenazim) summarizes the issue nicely.  The inception and spread of the Khazar theory has been almost exclusively through racist channels.  

You say you care about genetics?  There are three genetic studies sourced by the Wikipedia article that disprove a significant Jewish Khazar ancestry.  The most recent genetic study concludes
&gt;However, if the R-M17 chromosomes in Ashkenazi Jews do indeed represent the vestiges of the mysterious Khazars then, according to our data, this contribution was limited to either a single founder or a few closely related men, and does not exceed ~ 12% of the present-day Ashkenazim

Hell, the very site you link to concludes in its primary article,
&gt;Are all Jews around the world descended from the Khazars? Certainly not. East European Jewish ancestry originates substantially from ancient Judea, and the same is true of most other modern Jewish populations (with the exception of groups like Libyan Jews and Ethiopian Jews).

True,1426040889,1252445922,1,"We (the US) imported a large number of people of various nations and ethnicities, against their will.  We kept them enslaved across many generations and put laws into place to ensure that their descendants would never be anything other than slaves.  They looked different enough from Europeans that this worked, most of the time.  These people could not come and go as they pleased; where they lived and what they did was entirely someone else's decision.

Then came the civil war, the freeing of the slaves, the backlash of lynchings and Jim Crow laws, and the more recent Civil Rights movement.

So the differences we've got include the scale (as you mentioned), the fact that ""African-Americans"" belong to an ethnic group that was brought into being by American slavery and could never have existed otherwise, the fact that restrictions on individuals from this group were much more severe than was usually the case in Europe, and the fact that a ""black"" person's child would almost never be recognized as ""white"".

This ethnic group has generations of history in our country, and its situation has changed a hell of a lot due to several events over the last century and a half.  This is not the same thing as a recent influx of immigrants; in my opinion, this is why the situation of African-Americans as a group hasn't improved as rapidly as that of more recent populations.

Some minority groups have a long history in Europe.  Jews and Roma come to mind; there are probably others I don't know about.  The situation facing Blacks in America was pretty unique nonetheless.

True,1426040888,1252446318,15,"Men's Rights is a human rights issue.  Feminism is a human rights issue.  The difference is MRA focuses on human rights issues that affect men, and feminism focuses on human rights issues that affect women.  This is no more unusual than my primary focus for judicial law being Canada, with some interest in the USA.  (The USA laws are worse, and I'm liable to work there.)  I suspect a Brit would be far more interested in the laws of Europe than North America.  Obviously there's some overlap -- I'm a white male who has some interest in the plight of Middle Eastern women, but I will always be more passionate about causes which affect me directly.

It's also a marketing issue.  Telling men ""you, buddy, you right there, YOU can get screwed by the law"" is a much better way to get a man's attention than, ""I'm campaigning for equality.""  As a white male, when I hear equality, I tend to assume the inequality being addressed isn't mine.

Sometimes our goals meet, sometimes our goals conflict.  When it comes to say, rape conviction rates, a man's primary goal is to not get falsely accused, and a woman's primary goal is to get a rapist off the street ASAP.  Anything which increases rates of accurate reporting will help us both, but nothing is perfect, so anything which reduces false negatives is liable to increase false positives, and vice versa.  This makes for some contentious debates about what should and should not constitute evidence.  On one extreme, her word should be enough and any inconsistencies between testimony and physical evidence are to be expected given all the trauma she's been through, on the other side, videotaped evidence of the assault is only valid if you can prove she didn't forget the safeword.

I'm not sure how to resolve the above conflict.  My girlfriend and I have debates on this all the time, but recognizing our differing goals helps us see solutions which benefit both sides.

On the other hand, not everything is that conflicting.  Even Pierce -- the guy who runs the False Rape Society blog -- found some interest in the idea that if we can stop shaming women for being sexual creatures and treating them as the gatekeeper, we'd remove a societal pressure for false accusations.  In this example, the goals of the movements do not conflict.

Regarding the MRA's perception of feminism, I posted at length  [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/9ht53/when_men_do_better_it_is_because_of/c0cuyx4) on the issue.  The short version is that from the outside, both sides are going to seem against the other, because extremists are louder, because extremists push all the confirmation bias buttons, and because even moderate people seem to care more about their own gender than the opposite.  Caring more about causes that affect yourself is not sexism!

As a movement in relative youth compared to feminism, the MR guys are actually fertile ground for you to sow ideas.  There are a number of feminist causes that directly benefit men, and if you can help him see that, you can get yourself an ally.  Conversely, there's a number of MR issues which can help you.  Imagine if you knew that your boyfriend and maybe-future father of your children wouldn't get shamed if he wanted to be a stay at home dad.  (Also imagine if people didn't wonder what was wrong with you.)

And in a world where ""slut"" has no power, no girl will feel any pressure to tell say that she didn't want to, and your son forced her, unless that's actually true.

I'll cap off by saying that, yes /r/MensRights has some serious crazy, and it makes me roll my eyes as much as I'm sure it makes you.  Free speech does have a downside, but its a worthwhile price.  In the meantime, your boyfriend and you could have some interesting times coming to see one another's side.  If he says that feminism doesn't care about MR, then be the feminist that does.  One case study deserves another.  ^_^

90% got nothing spiritual or wise out of it, they were just like ""oooow, we've been at such a good rave yesterday, we get toooootally spaced out, we popped two E's and some crank, we were soooo tooootally fuuuucked, man, it was awesome..."" [1]

Five years later they got nothing good out of it, in fact, they became what we call over here ""droids"", thin, zombie-like stupid idiots dancing like robots at the rave, they got nothing spiritual, super-human out of it, what they got was below-human, they were worse than before, they became kinda... automatic... we the 10% were more conscious but they the 90% were less conscious, kinda became automatons...

For these reasons, I support that LSD, E, crank etc. must be illegal. (I'm not 100% sure about pot.) If it's illegal it perhaps helps the 90% stupid do it less, which is a good thing.

The 10% smart will do it anyway, because smart people can come up with ways how to break the law safely, it won't ever stop the smart people from trying it, thus, it will never stop those who can get real spiritual experiences out of it. 

Common sense: *if you aren't smart enough to break the drug laws safely, with almost 0 chance of an arrest[2], you aren't smart enough to do drugs and should not do so.* Period. Thus, no need to legalize. Illegality serves a useful function here.

Illegality seems to be the best way to try to keep drugs at least sometimes out of the hands of stupid people whom drugs make only less conscious, ""droids"", while it does not prevent the smart people whom drugs make more conscious from trying them at all.

That's my take.

The Families
------------------

Nathan Rothschild was once known to rule Europe.  It was public knowledge that his family did so.  All national governments had to kowtow to him.  No one thought it was a kooky idea.

Another Rothschild once said, ""Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not who makes its laws.""

**Google: Nathan Rothschild Waterloo, Amschel Rothschild**


The New World
-------------------------

So anyway, the new world was messing up the control.  From the colonies to the new 19th century nation.

They sent Rockefeller to the US and had him pretend he was a native and soon had a strong central bank up and running in the Wall Street district.  He took his orders from Europe.  More and more time passed.   Too create a distributed power center in the US they created Round Table Groups.

The groups were the parents of the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, the Fabians, the Bilderburg group and many many more.  Most of these organizations are political in nature.  Some were also created to buy
 controlling interest in the news media to control public opinion about the banks.  Congress caught them at this last activity and held a hearing...it went no where.

**Google: Rothschild Round Table Group**

**Google: CFR, Trilateral Commission, Fabianism**

Today

Anyway you were never taught any of this in any detail.  So its a shit ton of history.  Try to find objective links to the keywords I suggest above.  Some of it is a bit kooky, but stuff with bibliographies is more informative.

Lastly, you wanted the connection.

The error you make and I expect Moore to make, is to blame it the rich (which is partially correct, to the extent that they make or influence the enforced rules).

People are evil, and helpless to do anything about it? That's dismal.

Europe? What makes European countries qualitatively different from other industrialized nations?

Equality and fraternity? what? why is that important? Can you really establish fraternity through force? You cannot establish equality at all? People are different. If you're referring to equal rights, then it seems strange to champion the idea of government force as this typically makes things unequal.

Life is fine. life is great! but why and how should peoples' lives come in conflict with rights to property? If their life somehow supersedes property rights, then what's the good in having them?, and what's the good in trying to accumulate property/wealth when it can be appropriated at will? Who gets to decide these things?

Most governments aren't a Democracy per se. What governments typically do is take away the right to use violence and delegate it to a special class of people: Good for them, perhaps not so great for you depending.

Roads and bridges? Would you throw someone in jail or shoot them because they did not pay for a road or bridge they will never use?

I was tempted to close my account, but I had an upcoming trip to Europe.  After receiving my new ATM card, I called BoA and told them the exact dates that I would be in each European city.  In fact paranoia drove me to call a second time and confirm that they had received this information.  I withdraw money once in Istanbul - no problems.  The next time I go to withdraw money, my card doesn't work.  In fact, I had to borrow money from a friend for the remainder of our trip.  I return from Europe 2 weeks later, and I have one voicemail - a robot telling me that my card has been canceled due to suspicious activity abroad. FU BoA!

Here's the real heart of the matter though: health care is expensive because of government interference.  More government interference isn't going to help.  Government healthcare is essentially another form of wage and price controls which lead to shortages (or in the case of healthcare, rationing) and diminished healthcare quality.

True,1426041125,1252471664,6,"Well, I'd have a hard time naming a few specifically socialist books which I'd recommend. Chomsky's books often have good information about the problems with existing systems, but they don't really cover socialism very well as a positive alternative. 

I would suggest [""Why Socialism""](http://www.update.uu.se/~fbendz/library/why_soc.htm), by Albert Einstein, as a good read, although it's not a book, but an article.

[Understanding Capital and Society](http://rationalrevolution.net/articles/capitalism_economy.htm) is another good read, but again, not a book.

I've heard good things about **Libertarianism without Inequality**, by Michael Otsuka, but I haven't read it myself, so I don't know if it's good.

**Socialism: A Very Short Introduction** by Michael Newman looks promising, but again, I haven't had a chance to read it.

In terms of libertarian socialism, there are plenty of good reads on libertarianism - John Stuart Mill, for example, or much of the writings of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Much of these can be applied to socialism quite easily.

When it comes to socialism, research into the various 'socialist' systems which have been implemented can give you some ideas about things that have worked well, and problems and pitfalls they have experienced. One of the biggest problems with revolutionary socialism is the tendency for it to succeed under a strongman who sets himself up as a dictator, rather than creating a democratic power structure (an essential element of what can be rightfully termed 'socialism'). 

Another major problem in centralized socialist systems is the problem of information sharing - in many attempts at creating a socialist system, central authorities tried to take a major role in micromanaging the economy. Since they lacked a means of getting information for decision-making in real time, had an inability to account for local conditions, or accommodate local needs, they were unable to effectively function in important regards. 

However, by making most decisions on a more local level, needs can be better accommodated, and modern IT infrastructure can allow effective information sharing in real time. Some of this can be seen in the more socialist aspects of the social democracies of western Europe. If you do some research to compare the political systems of these countries, as well as historical socialist systems, you'll find a wealth of information.

I'm afraid I have failed to bookmark many of the better reads on socialism which I have found online, but if you search around, you'll find many articles on socialism, and those will often give you keywords that can be used to find other articles. I think most socialists will have one school of thought or another which they tend to prefer, and so many will have different lists of favorite writings on socialism.

If you want to discuss any aspects of socialism, I'm generally happy to discuss the topic, as I'm sure are many other redditors. Sorry I can't be more help with readings, though.",t3_9imhw,c0cxft7,,False,,,0,socialism,False,t5_2qjii,0,t3_9imhw,6,t1_c0cxft7,NonHomogenized,0
