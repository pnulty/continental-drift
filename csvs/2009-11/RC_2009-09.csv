On the contrary, Hitler was very much in control of his war, his country, Western Europe and his Generals in the Autumn of 1940 when he first directed his attentions to Russia.

And such a direction was not unexpected, it was Hitler's long term aspiration.  In Mein Kampf he wrote, ""when we speak of new territory, we must think of Russia. Destiny itself points the way there.""

Also, you don't need to take supplements to get Omega3:
""You can find foods fortified with Omega 3 fatty acids such as breads, juices, meal bars, margarine’s and oils. Supplements are also widely available, the most popular being Linseed/Flaxseed oil (which is one of the most concentrated plant sources of Omega 3).

Other good plant based sources of Omega 3 fatty acids are:
Leafy Green Vegetables

For a double hit make a spinach and walnut (see below) salad. Add any other ingredients of your choice.
Nuts

Walnuts, Brazil Nuts, Hazelnuts, Pecans. Brilliant as a snack instead of chocolate or sweets. Toast slightly under grill for a great taste.
Seeds

Choose a seeded roll when you go shopping. Sesame seeds also complement any slightly sweet or spicy chilli dressing.
Tahini

Tahini is a sesame seed paste that is used itself as a dip, and also as a base for some Middle Eastern sauces such as curries, as a 'roux' would be in European cooking.
Houmous

A great tasting chickpea dip (one of my favourites) – made with a tahini base!
Oils

Soya Bean Oil, Canola Oil, Rapeseed Oil, Linseed/Flaxseed Oil. Most of these can be found in your local supermarket. Experiment when cooking, marinating and dressing.""

The ONLY nutrient/vitamin etc that is not present in a plant-based diet is B12, and recent studies have shown that there is B12 in yeast and algae so using nutritional yeast and taking spirulina or including seaweed in ones diet can work (though I personally still use a fortified cereal once a week just in case.... as mentioned, I have no deficiencies, I get my blood tested regularly).

True,1426033918,1251795249,2,"Honestly, you probably haven't heard about it for political reasons. 

As far as what specific information the intelligence community had (and which agencies were involved with this information) I honestly don't know. I'm not sure if any of it has been publicly released either, but I haven't gone out of my way to look for this information. I doubt President Bush claimed that he personally gathered the intel himself, or got congress and half of Europe to believe it with a wink and a ""trust me"". I can give you a bit of Iraq's history with WMDs though.

Iraq certainly had WMDs in the 80s, this fact has never been in dispute. Saddam frequently deployed chemical weapons on Kurdish civilians. He was also developing biological and nuclear weaponry. After the Persian Gulf War in the early 90s, the UN (UNSCOM) went in and started dismantling much of the equipment used to develop these weapons. By 1998 Iraq had become quite uncooperative with UN weapons inspectors, so President Clinton bombed the shit out of them (see [Operation Desert Fox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Desert_Fox)). The weapons inspectors were recalled during this to avoid getting bombed by their own team, and UNSCOM was dissolved. Over the next few years Saddam repeatedly refused to let UN weapons inspectors in, until Resolution 1441 was passed in 2002. 

As for why there were none when the US got there, there might not have been much left after UNSCOM and Operation Desert Fox was done with them. Some of the feet-dragging might have been ""FUCK! THE COPS ARE HERE, FLUSH THE SHIT!"". My guess is that even though they didn't have many (or any) WMDs, they didn't want their neighbors to know that that they didn't.

Here's a [timeline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_disarmament_crisis_timeline_1997-2000) of events, but it's woefully lacking in sources.

Bigmac's are cheaper that side of the pond too, and so is pretty much everything else. I don't understand where the assumption that they would cost the same comes from. Also, there was no mention of what it'll cost in the UK, but most likely it will be more than 1699 *pounds*.

Here's the thing, and my main beef with the feds. Human organizations do not scale well. Small businessmen are great - everyone says ""support your local farmer"" and so on, but everyone hates monstrous corporations -and for good reason. Once an organization gets past a certain size, it simply becomes impossible for it to maintain a ""people first"" attitude or even for it to operate efficiently. Look at GM and Chrysler. Look at how the Japanese automakers are becoming stodgy and less able innovate (sure, they're better than the Americans, but they're becoming less so every day).

Look at how Google is evolving from ""don't be evil"" to ""you have no privacy"". Look at how Apple has changed from the scrappy underdog to the company that tells you what you can and cannot put on your telephone.

Now, look at health care: There are **no** national healthcare systems that manage 300 million people. The largest of the European countries is not that much larger than California. Asking the feds to create a single health care system for 300 million people makes as much sense as saying that a single minimum wage is correct for both Iowa and New York City. (The cost of living is the same in Manhattan and Des Moines? Seriously?)

So, why not? Why not let Californians decide what kind of health care they want, and let them fund it. For poorer states, sure we would probably need some sort of federal assistance but, again, that's a very different principle from trying to define a single health care system that can handle every variation in need from Nome to Key West - and if one of the states fuck it up, they'll have 49 other examples to choose from on how to do it better. People like oddmanout are convinced that we can get this right in one try. How often does that actually happen, in the real world?

Breaking a problem into smaller pieces is one of the keys of scalability in computers - and in everything else. So why not break up health care reform so that failures only affect a small percentage of the country instead of all 315 million of us?

Well:

&gt;The minimum amount of agricultural land necessary for sustainable food security, with a diversified diet similar to those of North America and Western Europe (hence including meat), is 0.5 of a hectare per person

That's 1.24 acres per person for food security, diversity, and:

&gt;This does not allow for any land degradation such as soil erosion, and it assumes adequate water supplies.

Source: http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/feb25/articles16.htm

A family of four to have food security for one year would need approximately 4.5 acres of land. 

So yeah, you'd have to fucking uproot the whole country, unless you want to divide labor and specialize farms, (which gasp! leads to farming as an industry, or _industrial farming_).

You also don't take into account climate, and that families in Maine can produce far less than families in Georgia, etc.

I hate this regressionist shit. Division of labor and specialization are _good things_. 

There is a lot of reform that can be done in agriculture, but you have your head in the sand. 

You asked me to look up the details, and I did, and the results are: You didn't look it up, and you must not know what you're talking about.

4.5 acres / family. 

Most homes are built on a 1/3 acre or less in the suburbs, and have probably 1/5 to 1/6 acre of arable land. (Or enough land to give food security to 0.13 human beings, if ALL land is utilized in optimum conditions.

I'm really not surprised at the results of this survey.

I work with a lot of foreign people, including a lot of interns. They come from all over Europe; primarily Germany, Spain, Austria and France; but also a lot of other countries. I live and work in Brighton, a lovely seaside city which has a huge international student population at any given time of year, due to the number of English language schools as well as its welcoming atmosphere. I'm interested in languages and other cultures, and I often end up chatting to the interns about their lives in Brighton, as well as before and after.

The general consensus is that interns generally fall in love with the city... but cannot believe the incredibly bad drinking problem they've noticed amongst young British people. Every single intern says the same thing, sadly. It's horrible to see with scary regularity - on a weekday night, no less - inebriated teenagers hanging out on street corners swigging bottles of Lambrini and cans of cheap lager, cigarettes hanging from mouths, generally being loud, boisterous, and violent among one another and insulting anybody who happens to be unlucky enough to have to walk by. Horrible.

It's unbelievably depressing, and the worst thing is that I know from spending a few years in Nottingham that Brighton is really the thin end of the wedge.

As much as I love this city (I grew up here), I cannot wait until next year, when I plan to going travelling around the world. The problem was never this bad when I was younger, but for some reason it has escalated to a ridiculous level in the last 5-10 years.

The principal problem here is that there is no longer a will to make war when necessary even if it takes a while.  Gratuitous war is immoral, but sometimes NOT going to war is also immoral. 

I do not share your view that most of the US military adventures post WWII were fought for some ignoble cause.  All of them had worthy starting points that promptly got hijacked by the self-loathing American left.

You are also incredibly naive if you believe a Muslim majority population in Europe will be benign.  These people come from places that have no common values with Europe - no sense of individual liberty, no notion of separating the church from governing (now that you've mostly managed to do that there), no sense of equal entitlement before the law for women,
gays, and other minorities.  An Islamic majority in Europe *will* be a disaster, not because all Muslims are evil, but because the religion itself directs the strictly faithful to consume all competitors.   In a few hundred years or so this will run its course, but in the mean time Europe is doomed if it does not cling to secular rule-of-law.  (You're also wrong about the Caliphate thing.  This is a loud drumbeat within Islamic circles.  I commend memri.org to your attention if you want to hear what the Islamists of the Middle East, at least, are saying in their own language - it's sobering.)

Also, you have your history confused on who did what to the Muslims when.  Prior to the Brits slapping the Ottomans around, there was a decidedly pro-Jewish sentiment in the halls of power in the UK.  Once oil flowing, there was a distinct turning away from the Jews and towards the Arabs in UK policy aided in some measure by T.E. Lawrence's scribblings (see: http://www.radicalacademy.com/pollawrenceofarabia.htm)  By the time WWII came along, the anti-Jewish sentiment was so strong that Jews escaping from Hitler's death camps to the UK in the early going were *returned* to Germany by the UK authorities.   In supporting the Muslims blindly, the UK gave voice to some really bad actors, aided and abetted by the insane partitioning plane they came up with when they left.  It is fair to say that in the post-Analusian history of Islam it has been a steady freight train towards increasing violence, decreasing tolerance, and THAT is why they are villified so much today, not because the US made it all up to suit its policy agenda.

As to fighting select extremism, there is an element of truth in what you say, but its not some kind of evil plan, but rather simple reality: You have to fight the most imminent threats first.  The Saudis are primarily a threat to themselves, not to us.  But the unholy trio of Iran, Iraq, and Syria are or were a threat to everyone.  Instead of hating Bush, you should be rejoicing that he neutered the 5th largest army in the world and took out a Stalinesque dictator.  There's be more of this to follow if the US didn't have such an Idiot President at the moment.  Obama is missing the opportunity of a lifetime that would feed his immense ego needs forever: He could drop the hammer on the Middle East and dictate the terms of peace to all the players simply by prying Iran open - Bush gave him all the tools he needs to do this.  Unfortunately, Obama is to poisoned by the puerile left ideology he's inhaled over the years and will never do this.  The result?  Probable nuclear confrontation between Israel and Iran within 50 years (or way less) barring a remarkable event.

Japan: There are many incidents of Japanese oppression of Korea from assassinations to massive protests suppression. Found a whole article devoted to [Japanese warcrimes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes).

Norway: The unification of Norway came about due to Halfdan and Harald conquering many smaller kingdoms and banishing or killing the current rulers. I will admit that not much can be confirmed due to the lack of proper record keeping as most is from almost mythical stories and such. 

The point being is that any country, going back far enough, has their fair share of closet skellies. 

The reason I defend America is because we catch so much slack for being in the spotlight during this time in history. Any other empire or country in history that was considered the ""superpower"" also meddled in other countries' affairs. Yet again, this is not excusable. I don't defend America's methods, only that they have not set some completely new precedent. It's a sad state of humanity that the most powerful nations must defend that ""superpower"" status at the expense of others. One day I hope our or some other nation can rise above that petty need.

I appreciate the challenge to search those countries' histories.

*Beyond Good &amp; Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future*, #237

This was first published by Nietzsche himself in 1886. That same year, he wrote a series of new prefaces for his existing body of work (everything up to *Zarathustra*), essentially pulling everything he'd been working on into focus. While Zarathustra was poetic and suggestive, *BGE*, the prefaces, and the projects which followed (all under the banner of ""a revaluation of a values""), were written to get his thoughts across clearly. 

So, the above quote sits at the beginning of a good four pages worth of Nietzsche's take on women. He doesn't *advocate* treating women like property, he *observes* that they've been treated as such.  These passages are a sustained examination of the rubric ""women."" Not brief metaphors, or silly punchlines, but paragraphs examining the positioning of women in Europe at the time. 

""Since the French Revolution,"" he writes ""Woman's influence in Europe has decreased proportionately as her rights and claims have increased. . .""

And so on. ""A horrendous hater of women,"" my ass.

Here's one from his ""middle period,"" from *Daybreak.* It goes:

""*Here we must invent new ideals*--We ought not to be permitted to come to a decision affecting our life when we are in the condition of being in love, not to determine once and for all the character of the company we keep on a violent whim: the oaths of lovers ought to be publicly declared invalid and marriage denied them:--the reason being that one ought to take marriage more seriously!""

Bertrand Russell was either pretending to know Nietzsche way better than he did, or he was too trusting of the second-hand accounts and slipshod translations available to him at the time. (*History* wasn't published until after the war, in 1945. *BG&amp;E* didn't get a decent translation until 1965. Nietzsche's work wasn't properly organized until the mid-70s.) The fact is, there's been a lot accomplished in the field of Nietzsche studies since the end of the second World War.",t3_9fbtu,c0cooj0,,True,,,0,philosophy,False,t5_2qh5b,0,t1_c0cn9dy,1,t1_c0cooj0,[deleted],0
True,1426034882,1251881574,2,"&gt; Well, if you want to debate a world without citizenships altogether and open borders that's another discussion. One I might even support, but I think it would still change the way things work more than you illustrate.

Open borders don't change much, we've already seen that in the areas where they already exist. True, a world without citizenship altogether is quite different and not necessarily desirable because a having many different government and financial systems allows for a greater level of variation (and thus innovation) and also creates resilience in the face of crisis (the current financial crisis wasn't even noticed in India's banking system, and Canada's rode it out quite well; that would not have been possible without the autonomous decision-making allowed for by the existence of different systems in the first place).

&gt; It kind of defeats the purpose, go back far enough in my family tree and I assume I could be a citizen anywhere in Europe.

But this is not what I've been arguing for, and thanks for the opportunity to bring that out. By descent, I am Swedish, Finnish, German, Irish, Scottish and Venezuelan. I don't think I should be able to claim those citizenships because they have not been 'maintained'. If you don't renew your relationship with the country, even in just a bureaucratic sense, then you don't really have a claim. Any benefit that comes from citizens abroad comes from them maintaining their ties with the 'home' country.

&gt; As for the exploits, I figure those were pretty obvious. We have socialized healthcare, cheap schools and the like. Your idea makes concepts like immigration non-existant as people can just come and go as they please.

Ahh, but here's the rub. Where health-care is concerned, it's not citizenship alone that confers access to Canada's healthcare system, the primary criterion is residency (since landed immigrants have access). I am a Canadian citizen (born and lived most of my life there), but, living outside of Canada, I need to buy health insurance when I travel to Canada because I am not resident. This is not the case for education, but it was probably deemed advantageous back when the transfer system was set up not to require residency to tap into post-secondary education, and it would not be difficult to require residency to apply to a Canadian university in the face of changing conditions (it's a simple amendment to existing legislation). In fact, all these possible scams that people bring up are stopped cold by requiring residency. When people do come to use these services, they also end up paying into the tax system anyways because using them requires effectively setting up residency and that always entails taxes, even if it is just sales taxes (which you can refuse to reimburse for stays longer than X days). ""Just visiting"" is extremely expensive tax wise, and if they become resident, you start collecting the normal range of taxes on them that you do on Canadians ""pure-laine"".

&gt; What does it say about the US's already staggeringly high unemployment rate if I could just move there tomorrow and apply for a job, bypassing all the red tape.

Require residency for UI, end of problem. As for competition for jobs, then it provides a good incentive to the government to make sure that the education system produces a superior product (it is interesting that the government that is so interested in binding Canadians to Canada is also so disinterested in maintaining the quality of education in the country). I'm not saying that this solves all the problems that presents, but I don't see that ""removing"" the citizenship of Canadians' grandchildren, or requiring their mothers to fly to Canada for a few days, is the **only** way to address the problem

&gt; What does it say about trade if I can claim citizenship and bring X amount of dollars of stuff across borders without fee's or tariffs, claiming I'm just moving back and forth between my two homes?

Yes, but the whole movement in the world is towards dropping this crap anyways. Why take a step backward to maintain a notion of citizenship that was valid and useful in a world that doesn't exist anymore?

&gt; ""Oh you were living out of the country a bit and had a kid there? No problem! They can still be a citizen"". ""Oh, your kid who you had while not living here also grew up and also had a kid while not living here? Well...

&gt; Either way, I find the whole argument a little strange.""

How is requiring people to hop on a plane, as long as they do it before they are 7 months pregnant, not strange? In fact, it is similar to, and not as exacting as, a system as requiring residency to benefit from the public purse. Conferring citizenship on birth means that you only need to have been in the country once in your life in such an inconsequential manner, it's ridiculous. Why not make the citizenship game such that people are **encouraged** to come back to the country rather than use the threat of the ""exile"" of their descendants to keep them locked inside the house? The Conservatives seem to be fond of using these fear-based means for doing everything they do, from appealing to people in elections, to governing. In this case, it makes Canada move backward rather than forward.

What is weird about all this is that the concept of citizenship that the Canadian government is putting forward only limits Canadians, rather than making sure that people who wish to become Canadians are doing so for the right reasons and will actually bring something of value to the country. 

I would think that the immediate problems of citizenship and immigration would be better addressed by correcting the way we deal with people who have no connection to the country at all, rather than making life difficult for people who are already Canadian (I am thinking of Canadians going abroad who are concerned about the legal status of their descendants). I take it to be the small-minded mentality of the Conservatives who wish to punish these people for ""betraying"" them, it is quite a bit like the emotional state of a spurned lover. 

Like I said, a more rational system would seek to use the experience and position of Canadians living abroad to Canada's advantage and seek to entice them into coming home (since they are the most preferred ""immigrants"" because they already have a connection to the country), rather than requiring them to ""game"" a more restrictive and vindictive system by having pregnant ladies timing their flights back to Canada properly.

&gt;  On one hand you emphasize how citizenship is of little importance, Then on the other hand we have people overreacting because citizenship is extremely important/valuable to them.

What I am saying is that the model of citizenship being put forward by the Conservatives is a model that worked in a world that no longer exists. When people and goods move around the world more freely than before, Canada should shape its model of citizenship in such a way that it takes advantage of the movement of people and goods, rather than deny itself that advantage and try to ""punish"" people who want to live in the world as it is, rather than as it was.

The first steps towards realizing this new model would be tying government benefits to residency  or residency + citizenship. This would remove most objections to passing citizenship through active maintenance of citizenship in lines of descent outside of the country. Another piece of the puzzle is to more actively solicit energy of Canadians living outside the country to advance Canada's goals. There's another piece. That would be the foundation of a model of citizenship that works in the 21st century rather than in the 19th century.

BTW I up-voted you. For some strange reason, someone down-voted you; probably because you tried to engage in rational discussion of the issue rather than saying ""STFU! Canada #1! Live here or fuck you!""

True,1426035016,1251902748,1,"Actually I did understand the article. I agree with the authors that it's important to get the biggest bang for the buck. I'm willing to concede that my emergency room example is flawed. It's entirely possible that a visit to the emergency room may improve quality of life just as inexpensively as routine visits to a primary care provider. On the surface it seems like it wouldn't but maybe that's just my biased thinking. Either way the uninsured patient will still have to be covered by taxpayers.

Allow me to change the topic a bit and ask you another question. Do you feel that healthcare in the US is accurately priced? It seems we hear a lot about how healthcare dollars in America don't go as far as they used to go. We also hear that per capita the EU spends several thousand dollars less each year on its citizens for health care. We are then told that the EU lifespan and quality of life is better than in the US. What this implies (though doesn't prove) is that we aren't getting our money's worth in the US when it comes to healthcare. 

If you buy this argument and you could figure out a way to lower healthcare costs then it would seem to affect the studies that you cited. In some cases the treatments might be less expensive. In other cases they wouldn't be done. I guess what I'm wondering is if you try to wring the extra expenses out of the US healthcare system then at some point it would seem that preventative care may become much more cost effective. This of course would be mitigated by the fact that you may not provide the treatments where the expense/QALY ratio is 1 or less.

True,1426035019,1251903346,1,"I'm trying to be less of an asshole, and trying to present actual arguments even when I think the subject (ie: taxation == theft) doesn't really merit them.

I can't remember my original comment word for word but it went something like:

&gt;If taxation is theft, then property is theft, so its all a wash.

And, truly, I do think the ""taxation is theft"" line is about as silly and pointless as the ""all property is theft"" line.  Moreso, really, as the ""all property is theft"" line has some actual thinking behind it and does make a (twisty and not really useful) sort of sense.

&gt;Somalia seems like a hell hole, and I don't think using it as an example of libertarian utopia is apt.

In general, I agree, which is why I didn't make that claim.  I do think that, in the long run, any attempt at a Libertarian ""state"" would fail and fail in a manner very similar to Somalia.  But that doesn't make the ""Libertarianism == Somalia"" argument really valid.  Its a dismissive cheapshot, and like I said, I'm trying (with varying degrees of success) to avoid those.

&gt;Correlation without causation. Unless you can show a causal relationship?

Nope.  But I can show that *every* state with an essentially non-existent tax structure is a hellhole.  Which doesn't prove causation, but does strongly imply it.

Governments provide necessary services, not the least of which are military and international law enforcement of borders, territorial waters, etc.  One of the many problems facing Somalia today is that since it isn't really a state anymore, since it doesn't really have a government anymore (much less a military) it can't enforce either, and many European corporations have taken to dumping toxic waste into Somali waters.

You can't do that without taxation.

Roads, schools, etc all require taxes.  And no, I don't think the Libertarian fantasy of private parties doing that instead of the government would work.  I think Libertarianism/Randism is essentially a utopian position, that is it requires people to act in a non-human manner.  People are lazy, they're not rational economic actors, and they're often shockingly short sighted.  Investing in infrastructure, education, etc (especially if it costs a lot, and it will) is not something most people will do voluntarily.

Some will, yes.  I, for example, am paying an outrageous sum every month to put my child (now 3) in the best, most accelerated, richest educational environment available in my area.  This is costing me roughly 11% of my income (after taxes), and the only return I'll see on that investment is that my child will be better educated than many of his peers.

The problem is that a modern society requires a certain degree of education for all (or at least the vast majority) of its population or it won't work.  And I doubt both the willingness and ability of many people to make the economic sacrifice necessary to provide that education for their children.

&gt;I can go live with my brother and not pay rent.

And you can not have any income and not pay taxes, lots of homeless people do this.  Its an unattractive choice, but so is living with family.

&gt;Not so much with governments: some states forbid citizens from leaving

Yours does not, so that argument is irrelevant to the discussion at hand.

&gt;and with those that do allow citizens to leave, there isn't any land of the free left on the planet.

Sure there is, its just all very unattractive.  While I agree that Somalia is not a Libertarian paradise, its there, you could move there, its unattractive but you can't claim it doesn't exist.  Similarly, there is Antarctica, various ice shelves (though that's a chancy proposition given the melt rate), and probably at least a few tiny islands that can be purchased for insanely high dollar values.

There's also Sealand, and a few other similar places.

But, I also think this illustrates my point.  Your philosophy is unworkable, if it were you'd have a Libertarian paradise to move to.  Yet out of all the political philosophies that have succeeded well enough to have functioning (or even semi-functioning) nations subscribing, Libertarianism/Randism stands almost alone in not having any nation.

I argue that this is largely because its an unworkable philosophy.

Since, contrary to the claims of many Libertarin/Randites, America is not a dictatorship, you are perfectly free to try and convince your fellow Americans that your position is correct, that taxation really is theft, and win elections.  You don't seem to have had any success in that area, and I argue that this is because most people look at your philosophy and realize that its inherently unworkable.

My point remains: if you are so philosophically opposed to paying taxes you can leave.  You can try to convince enough voters to go along with your philosophy to change US policy.

If there's no where you want to go that's hardly my fault, or the fault of the US government.  I fail to see how anyone is under an obligation to provide you with a Libertarian paradise in which to live.  If you can't get enough people to create one, I'd say that's pretty good evidence that your philosophy isn't really all that workable.

EDIT: I should add, though its probably obvious from my comments, that I am opposed to trying to turn America into your Libertarian paradise, and will actively work against that goal.  I don't think it will work, and I'd rather not see my nation ruined in which I see as a futile attempt to implement an inherently flawed and unworkable political/economic philosophy.",t3_9g971,c0coxi0,,True,,,0,politics,False,t5_2cneq,0,t1_c0co6cs,1,t1_c0coxi0,sotonohito,0

Pick up Risk as your first board game. Most geeks know how to play, and its a very fun game. You can find it at any store that sells board games, and its easy to learn the rules. There is a lot of luck involved, but overall it is a blast to play.  What I did personally was find two friends to play RISK with, then we slowly added a few more into our ""Board-game group"" (It helps if you already have something similar to a D&amp;D group). You might consider splitting costs for new board games if a student.

Where you move from RISK is entirely up to you. I went with more European/German style board games such as my favorite [Puerto Rico](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3076) and Settlers of Catan. I find European board games to have a lot more depth of strategy and a lot higher quality of a game than your traditional American board games (Monopoly,Risk,Clue).

I **highly** recommend checking out Puerto Rico. Every *intellgent* person I have taught this game to has absolutely loved it. It is 95% strategy with almost no luck involved. You are a spaniard who owns a piece of Puerto Rico and must trade goods such as cofee, indigo,corn for money which you use to build things to expand your control over the economy. Every round everyone chooses a role such as ""Captain"" which lets you ship goods to Spain for ""Victory points"", the catch is that everyone can ship goods as well. You have to balance what you want to do, and what you don't want your opponent to do. Like I said before it is purely strategy based, having to balance your economy with production while worrying about your opponents.

I would recommend reading a few reviews on [Board Game Geeks](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgame) who can explain it better than I.

Israel is the regional power. It is the big mean dog, it has all that it wants, the land, military dominance over all its neighbours, trade, the coverage of the worlds only super power. Therefore Israel wants to maintain the current status quo as is. Israel wants to impose its will calling it peace on a defeated people. Those who rule always want that kind of peace.

I dont expect everyone to agree with the Palestinian POV but at least to understand it.

Palestinians do not place the same premium on peace the Israelis do. They have very little. They have issues that need addressing, the right of return, the occupation of the West Bank, the annexation of Jerusalem, the economic shut down, the total control and blockade of their areas. They see peace as surrender. This is why they keep firing rockets. They want justice. The ruled always do.

To get Peace the Israelis have to address issues they do not want to. Until Israel is prepared to do that, there will not be peace.

It can be done, The UK showed the way when it talked to the IRA with no pre-condtions. No, ""edit the United Ireland part of your charter"" before we talk. The commander of the Londonderry IRA is now a UK member of parliament and Northern Ireland is still a part of the UK. By talking to the extremists, you fractionalise them, those that want peace, and those that want to fight. To strengthen the hand of those that want peace serious concessions have to be made, when those that want to derail the peace talks strike with rocket attacks and car bombs you have to be very careful with retaliation. Its a long slow road, but there was a time when Northern Ireland looked as hopeless as Palestine, but look at it now.

The PLO was willing to change its charter and recognize Israel, didn't get them anywhere...

The solution to the problems obvious. All the peace plans are essentially the same. Clinton's Peace Plan, the Nusseiba-Ayalon Plan, the Saudi Peace Initiative, Bush’s Road Map, Oslo, Taba summit are all similar

They all include clear measures that Israel has to take in order to make peace:

1.Dismantle the settlements.  
2.Withdraw its soldiers and civilians from the occupied territories,  
3.Allow the creation a viable Palestinian state.      
4.find a solution for the Palestinian refugees' right of return.   
5.Find a way to guarantee Israeli security. Altho' I believe having nuke addresses that.  
6.A creative way to reward Israel for giving up what it feels it has won in war.

The problem is Israel will not to go along with these plans. At some point, there will be an event and the talks will fail. developing new plans is a waste of time. Israel wants land, specifically the West Bank. Israel has not dismantled a single settlement built there, and has never ceased to take Palestinian lands under the guise of security. This is the underlying tactic. The aim is to create a ""reality on the ground"" where it become impossible to uproot 100,000's of settlers. The Palestinians will become a servant population within this greater Israel ruled by a compliant Palestinian authority.  

My greatest insight occurred while living in Israel.
I came to realize Israel is a typical colonialist project.
Europeans jews using American Jewish wealth, politics and violence to transfer a native population from their land using using a tried and true tactic.
You start friendly, grow in strength, then remove more natives, when they see what is happening and they resist play the ""we are the victims of native violence"" card and use greater violence to remove greater numbers. Continue until you got all you want.

Yup and yup and you're arguing a straw man. 

My point is simply this: People living in Canada, be they citizens, landed, or refugees should be the focus of our government and its people. 

People choosing to peruse life outside of Canada - citizens or not, should, after a period of time, have some of their ties to this country lessened. (And really with this law we're talking generations here)

I see no issue with that. A Canadian citizen will never lose citizenship, however an extended absence can result in the ability to pass that privilege on. This is logical in my mind, and respectful of the responsibilities of such a citizenship. I'm also Italian(euro) and have UK citizenship. I can pass neither on to my children without living in Europe for a time. I see nothing wrong with that. Extending the benefits and responsibilities to my children is irresponsible if those children know nothing about the culture or country they are supposedly citizens of. 

&gt;The best solution is just to let those who already have a connection to the country maintain and pass on that connection to their descendants as long as they wish to maintain that connection. It only has upside for the country and very little cost over the long term.

1. You assume that people who don't know anything about the country and don't care about it will want to maintain citizenship (my father didn't maintain his claims to citizenship in Finland). I would argue that if someone is interested enough in the country to want to maintain citizenship, it is worth it for the country to do so. Your arguments about that responsibilities, etc, make more sense in the perspective of a world where travel was rarer and trade was far more restricted. You limit the options of descendants Canadians who would want to work for multinationals or study abroad  (like the father-in-law of the OP) or those who would serve Canada directly in overseas roles. It is simply not in the country's interest to give someone who might advance Canada's lot a reason to limit their horizons, especially now that borders are more ""porous"" to the movement of people and goods than they ever were (and this is only going to increase as long as the world economy is a world economy, if it somehow retreats from being a world economy, we'll have much larger problems than who gets to be a citizen or not).

2.

&gt; The post's insistence that a person that has never entered the country and won't in the foreseeable future should somehow be a citizen while a skilled person that actually wants to make a living here in Canada can't without jumping through innumerable hoops.

What exactly is lost to anyone if that person doesn't want to come back then? The skilled labourer gets their job and eventually becomes a citizen, and the overseas Canadian continues to pay consular fees. The value of citizenship is maximized if it is both hard to attain and hard to lose. If the overseas Canadian chooses to come back to contribute directly to the Canadian economy, why should the claim of a non-citizen to be a citizen be more important than the status of what was a citizen before the legislation change and who has a greater connection to Canadian society through heritage and culture (I don't know why you assume that Canadians overseas become detached from Canadian culture... most ""Canadians"" complain about how new canadians are too attached to their home countries, as well as their children).

In the end, I am arguing for a notion of citizenship that recognizes basically that people are becoming less and less formal citizens of this or those countries and more and more informal citizens of the world. The formal legal system around citizenship needs to change to reflect that reality a little more... we don't live in the 19th century anymore. 

What is sad is that this would be less of a debate if we were talking about people moving back and forth between North America, Europe and a few Asian countries, since there would be less economic migration on the part of unskilled or low-skilled workers. It's the possibility of people from countries in the 3rd world playing a best of both worlds game that screws things up. One can only hope that we find some way of equalizing the estate of all countries so that this is less of a threat and we can all move forward together.

I suppose the difference in our views is that where you prefer a more inward looking government, I prefer a government that looks outward and seeks more integration with what is going on outside its borders (and I think this is necessary especially because most of the institutional entities that operate within Canadian borders are multi-national actors. If Canada wants to be able to control these entities, it needs to increase its ability to exercise soft power in the other areas of the world where these entities operate. Having Canadian citizens in those areas of the world is just one part of that program). Citizenship is not just about taking care of people, it is also about power projection and influence, as history has shown many times.

True,1426035327,1251923069,3,"I think, first, we need to have a common definition of the term ""socialism"" - from an economics standpoint, it commonly refers to a system in which the government owns the means of production within an economy. The BEST experiment with socialism that was ever conducted was in Britian in the 1950s/early60s- after WWII, it was completely necessary to rebuild the shattered country. 

Unfortunately, socialism- again, going by the purely economic definition, was a failure. The economy of Britain stagnated compared with the rest of the developed world as its government-controlled corporations couldn't compete with capitalist entites, both in Europe and around the world. As a result, Britain largely abandoned its socialist experiment- with several (NHS) important exceptions. 

So...my problem with socialism is that it is an inefficient means of resource allocation. (How's THAT for an example of why economics is called  the ""dismal science"" - no room for bleeding hearts in its tenants, that's for sure.) Now, I understand that there are such things as purely ""public goods"" for which government ownership of production is essential. Think national defense, police, utilities (a public good in my opinion, though this has been debated), fire protection (fire tends not to care if one house has private fire protection, one doesn't, and so on), etc...

Socialist states are where the government controls the means of production. The government owns the banks, owns the media, owns the car companies, owns the mines, the farms everything. The fruits of labor are distributed in a egalitarian fashion. 

Welfare states are states where government takes responsibility for assuring their citizens of a minimum standard of quality of life. 
 
Sweden for example is often refered to as a socialist country, when it is in fact just an extreme welfare state. The economic engine of Sweden are private companies. They are then heavily taxed, and the government then supports those who don't support themselves. 

It is actually one of the less socialized countries in Europe, though mostly because during WWII it was neutral, as the rest of Europe destroyed its industry. 

America totally rejects socialism while embracing welfare at a moderate level. We buy what we need from private companies instead of having a government operation build it. 

We don't socialize food, we give food stamps. We don't build bombers, McDonald-Douglas does. We don't build power plants, we set up corporations and co-ops to do it. Sure regulation is necessary, but we always use the market to do the lifting, even if the government is doing the buying. 

I think we should expand our welfare state to include health care, but we absolutely should net have government run the health care industry. This is how the French, and the Sweds run their system. Companies operate hospitals and even insurance companies but the government pays for it. 

But we shouldn't become a socialist nation. Its not a good way of creating wealth, and even educated Europeans will say so. Look at Europe, they've been privatizing their national industries since the 1970's.

If one is going to claim that the United States military did not kill the vast majority of the 1 million+ dead in Iraq since the US-lead invasion of Iraq, then:

* Saddam did not kill millions of his own people fighting Iran.  
* The Iranian military killed those millions of the Iraqi people in that war.  
* Saddam, if we are going to be consistent, killed millions of Iranians in that war. 

Now, that isn't to say Saddam didn't kill Iraqi's from time to time.  But he never really did it in anything as fair as fight them in a war.   He was much more the kind of guy to shoot people in the a barrel -- as anyone confined to a barrel can't really shoot back.

Even if one takes Bush at his word -- that he intended to bring them Democratic Republican government -- one still can't help but notice what he really brought them was a massive civil war that was 100% totally predictable.    It was predictable because we saw it happen before.   In lots of other nations marred by years of dictatorship, composed of multiple ethnic groups with a history of not getting along too well.   

Examples that spring to mind:  

* The  former Yugoslavia after the fall of Communism.  
* Did you maybe notice all those wars in Africa since the French, Belgians, and British went home? 
* Or pretty much all of Central, Eastern and Southern Europe at the end of both World Wars.   All the groups launched at each other in a revenge feud that lots and lots of history books have been written about.   The only thing that prevented things from getting out of hand at the end of WW2 was that Stalin wanted a bit of peace and quiet.... and it still took the Soviets a good 4-5 years to put a good lid on it all.  

And Stalin was.... well, Stalin!    A guy who makes Hussein look like a tickle-me-Elmo doll in comparison. 

And what really gets to me the most: it wasn't just predictable.  It was actually predicted.    The most vocal group that talked about that before the invasion of Iraq were Republicans who were against the invasion.  Folks like Jerry Pournelle and -- if you listen closely to what Colin Powell meant by ""pottery barn rules"" --  The then United States Secretary of State himself predicted it!  The fact that President Bush didn't listen or understand is well.... deserving of a war crimes tribunal that will never happen.

Why not? Save your wages for a little while longer so you can afford health insurance while your startup is starting up. (Income taxes are lower than in most European countries, so you can save up faster!)

When you leave your job, you can still buy into your previous employer's group health care plan for 18 months. After that, you can join an association that offers access to a health plan (for example, the Society for Technical Communications has a group plan) or buy an individual plan. If you choose the latter, you can get a ""major medical"" plan that only covers catastrophic expenses and pay routine expenses out-of-pocket. And if you are married, and your spouse is still working for an employer, rather than joining you in your startup, you can get coverage through their health plan.

In Summary. Based on the uncertainties of the searching process, and the number of amendments and drawings that may be required, one can typically expect to spend at least $3000.00 for obtaining a United States Patent. These costs however, as noted-above, could be substantially [i.e., astronomically] higher. In addition, if one wants to protect an invention outside of the United States, they can expect to expend an additional $10000 per each foreign country in which protection is sought

Anybody who isn't totally drunk on Allied Propaganda knows that political tensions in Central Europe preceded Hitler. In World War One, 15% of Germany was carved off and given to the victors. Some of it--the lucrative German-speaking Alsace region (with all its factories)--went to France. The majority of it, though, ended up as a contribution to the new Polish state. Pilsudski--the Polish George Washington--conducted ethnic cleansings on Germans (who had lived on those lands for centuries) to ""Polonize"" the land. There were mass-killings of German-speakers, whose property and farms were then given to ethnic Poles.

Germany complained to the League of Nations. You can even see pre-World War II pictures on the internet of the genocide-attempt conducted by the Poles--which explains why the Germans were greeted as liberators during World War Two when they came back to these lands.

In other words, Germany didn't technically invade ""Poland"". They returned to provinces that had been German, pre-World War One--and where everyone spoke German, had names like Dieter, Hans and Fritz and ate wiener-schnitzl.

I mean, imagine if the U.S. had lost a war and, say, Brazil declared that it had the legal right to portion off 15% of the United States' landmass to Mexico. Now imagine Mexicans coming into Arizona, Nevada and California and killing English-speakers with names like Smith, Jones and Williams. Now imagine a mere ten years later, if the U.S. sent troops back into the still-overwhelmingly English-speaking states and took the land back. (The English-speakers--who would have had their land given to Spanish-speaking Mexicans, and who would have been second-class Mexican citizens overnight--would have cheered to high Heaven.)

That's basically what happened after World War One, with Germany and these -- ahem! -- ""Polish"" provinces.

Unless you know these facts, history is incomprehensible. It starts making sense, though, when you dispense with propaganda and learn more about the regions and the players involved.

Other people will view individual liberty as a higher principle and so will tend to support capitalism, i.e. the *free* markets.

The fact is neither the US or Europe are really capitalist or socialist. Property, such as labor, homes, land, intellectual, etc, is treated differently in each country, so it's not so easy to make blanket statements like ""the US is capitalist"" and ""Sweden is socialist.""

Cause she's awesome, and was the 6 years we were together before we got married.

2. I would certainly stop frequenting your business, and would let my friends and family know that you put your money where your mouth is, and point out that by them going there they are putting their money where your mouth is too. Would I burn the place down or vandalize it? No. Absolutely not. Would I try and get you fired? Well, are you verbally abusing me at my place of business and denying me a promotion based solely on my orientation? Then yes, I would. Otherwise, no.

3. Marriage, as soon as it was announced in CA, was announced to me by my friend as soon as it became legal. We made plans, and found time about a month before the election. So it breaks down 90% planned, 10% fear the ""window would shut."" We were so bitterly disappointed when we heard the news.

4. I suppose if you were the checkout girl..sure, I guess. In general, I usually don't talk politics and religion. I use the internet to vent, but in my general public life, I state facts about how not being able to enjoy the legal aspects of marriage puts a damper on a lot of things, and move on. Other than that, I really don't ever leave my house, so our chances would be slim anyway.

5. Civil unions, as currently understood, are not the same as marriage, in a legal sense. If civil unions is a word the gov't will use to replace the current legal rights and responsibilities of marriage (about 1,049 state and federal), then that is fine with me. I have always said this is a matter of rights, not religion. I haven't stepped foot in a church since 2003, and I have no plans to ever do so again. So if a church does not wish to recognize my union, well, more power to them. It's their right as Americans. I just wish to have the legal protections, as my family has legal rights as next of kin, but are absolutely not a part of my life and should have no right to my property after death, etc.

6. Science. There are many studies that show that incest carries very heavy psychological landmines. Polygamy: no problem. I don't care for it, so I won't do it. But if consenting adults wish to enter into a menage-a-whatever, more power to them.

7. Thanks. It's actually gone by very smoothly. We did estate planning 4 years ago, have lived together for 6, had a wedding 3 years ago and just finally got the marriage certificate a year ago. Sorry to say, but almost anti-climactic.

http://www.bookrags.com/wiki/Estonian_War_of_Independence (ca 4000 Finnish volunteers, 3000 White Russians)

http://www.estemb.org/estonia/history/aid-2503 (
3,700 Finns, more than 5,000 Russians of the North West White Army, 9,800 Latvians, 3,000 British, 400 Swedes and 250 Danes and up to 700 Baltic Germans)

But none-the-less, even the smallest number of men was an important contribution, but an amount of 5 to 20 thousand was -I agree- indeed huge.

 &gt; the reason estonians didn't see germans as the ""bad guy"" is because they sympathized with nazis like finland for *whatever reason*.

The reason is, for the common folks here the whole WW2 goes a bit like this: 

* Baltic Germans live in Estonia for hundreds of years, they are okay. 
* World War 2 started, Baltic Germans were invited to Germany by Hitler, they left. 
* Estonia was a neutral independent country - then along come the Russians saying we need protection from Germans, start harassing and we have to let their troops in -  a 10 year treaty is signed. They start looting, raping, stealing, killing, repressing and transporting people away. 
* Then Germans come - Russians flee, Germans kill Jews but on the same time keep it in secret and don't do much bad to the local people, the common people is unaware of the negative aspect of German regime.
* Along come the Russians again - Germans flee, Russians declare we need liberating and take us over - and again start killing, deporting and repressing the local people and its culture. Local people think ""hmm, Germans didn't do that"". 

The thing is, as paradoxical as it is, Estonia has had better luck with German regimes and thus in local people's eyes, they were an enemy, but not the *worse* one. So if they were given an option to fight on either side, they chose the German side. It has absolutely nothing to do with nazis, it has all to do with the one fact that it was just a *lesser of two evil regimes*.

Almost all of Africa was conquered and divided up and no one thought to consult the people that lived there before. Even now China is setting up shop to supply themselves with whatever resources are left. 

One could also argue that Africa is a victim of world socialism. Almost all first world nations send aid to Africa and it's not getting any better for the people that don't live in developed former colonies. I'm not against sending aid to Africa at all, but I don't see any nation really offering citizenship or refugee status to them, or teaching them useful skills or knowledge. They don't need to be able to sell things or make money to survive. They need knowledge. All we give them is food and missionaries.

America is like Africa in that respect. If they had had a chance or the will to stand up and save something for themselves, it may be different for them now. Same with Native Americans. But in the end it was our ancestors that fought back and started whatever it is we have now. No one provided for this continent before the first taxes were laid. 

The fight now is against **state** socialism and **corporate** capitalism. And retaining the knowledge and ability to produce the things we need and stand up for ourselves if we have to while still having free time left over to advance as a people. As Humans.

From his own writings, and from the the plans that he had set beforehand, we know he had intentionally moved the goalposts of his demands to Czechoslovakia every time his demands were met in an attempt to force them into failing the demands and sparking a war. 

He wrote of his frustrations that he didn't get his war. He wrote that eastern expansion either ""with Britain, without Britain, or against Britain"" was the only way his country could overcome its mounting upside-down debts and looming economic collapse. After Britain repeatedly turned down his attempts to form an alliance with them, he started plans to expand ""against Britain,"" thinking that Britain would surrender quickly if they were directly bombed. His military advisers warned him against invading Poland, saying that France would intervene and Britain would support France, and that Germany wasn't ready to fight both at once. Hitler choose to trust his own regional expert instead, who assured him that France would let Poland go without a fight.

&gt;But if Hitler was out to conquer the world … why did he spend three years building that hugely expensive Siegfried Line to protect Germany from France? Why did he start the war with no surface fleet, no troop transports and only 29 oceangoing submarines? How do you conquer the world with a navy that can’t get out of the Baltic Sea? … Why did he offer the British peace, twice, after Poland fell, and again after France fell?

This is pretty much what his advisers told him. It's pretty clear, from Hitler's own writings, that he thought he would win anyway. Hitler tried so many times to instigate war, that just because he hoped France and Britain wouldn't defend Poland doesn't mean he didn't push Europe into war. He rearmed Germany in violation of the Treaty of Versailles; he invaded his neighbors, who were allies of other European powers; he openly made alliances with powers hostile to the allies. He basically shat on everyone around Germany until Europe was sick of it. His actions, if not his own words and his own writings, clearly demonstrates that he wanted a war.

You realize that most people who are deniers of the Shoah are not saying that it did not happen, don't you?  They are saying it did not go down the way the Shoah business demand it did.  Take the case of David Cole. A young Jewish holocaust denier, posing as a believer, puts some hard questions to the senior curator of the Auschwitz State Museum. After making this video, a ""hit"" was put out on Cole, and a reward for information on his whereabouts was issued by Irv Rubin (who years later, was arrested by the FBI for planning to kill a Lebanese-American Congressman.) Fearing assassination, Cole went into hiding. He never surfaced again publicly.  Now my point all along is not the finer points of the holocaust, but rather if we were in Europe having this debate/discussion one if not both of us would be sitting in solitary.

""Individualistic"" has the wrong connotation maybe. They surely do their own thing, but keep more long-term relationships with other people, among other things through not moving as often or as far, long-term memberships of local organizations, etc., which makes superficial acquaintances more meaningful.

Anyhow, I kept messing with her hair on camera, playing piano in the background, she kept trying to hit me, and then we were sent outside to play because we were beings, well, kids.

We're outside playing on the swings and the merry-go-round... There was a pillow on a seat, so I took it and hit her with it. She kicked me in the crotch, I went down...

Fast-forward 13 years or so....

I had just gotten out of a on-again, off-again relationship, had some friends bail out on a road trip that EVERYONE wanted to join me on, and had some bad dates from an internet dating site. At that point, I basically said that I was pretty much done with dating, and wouldn't have a problem with being single forever.

So she comes to visit said aunt for a bit to see the country, and both of them then come down to Texas for my mother's surprise 50th birthday party. I was hiking in the Grand Canyon at the time, having a blast. My mom's sister called me while I was gone to tell me that this Polish girl was coming... I said, ""Whatever... don't care, won't be there."" Last I thought of it.

So this girl stays - she wants to see more of the country, and Mom's happy to help... with ulterior motives of matchmaking, of course. So I come home early one Saturday morning, after a few weeks on the road, unshaved and smelling like a yak during the warm months. I talk to Dad for a few minutes - Mom's gone shopping with this girl, then take a nice, long hot shower. It was my first real one in a week or so, so I enjoyed it for a while. Anyhow, I'd forgotten about her, and just tossed on a pair of boxers and headed to the kitchen to get something to eat... 

She was there. Looking at me in my near-naked glory. With a pudge, in my underwear, still unshaved.

Shit.

Turned around, went back to my room, got dressed, came back for the meet-and-greet...

The next day, I forgot about her, so I wandered into the kitchen again in my boxers, this time unshowered... There she was again...

Shit.

Turned around, went back to my room, got dressed.

Anyhow, I got assigned chauffeur duties for her and my 13 year-old-cousin, who was also came to visit from Poland at the same time. I took them all over Texas, to show them around, etc... Eventually it got serious with her... 

OK, it took me three weeks from the ""serious"" part to giving her a ring. She looked like she was about to throw up. Good times.

She did say yes, though.

So then, it was a ""let's not tell my parents yet..."" thing. Hell, we didn't tell my cousin - he was with us ALL the time, and basically we knew that he was my mother's spy. We kept it up pretty damned well, too. My mother and her aunt were still plotting on how to get us together...

Cue a few weeks ahead...

Mom and Dad were leaving on a week-long trip, getting the car packed, running late. We decided that was the best time to spring the news on them. About two minutes or so before they leave, We tell Mom that we have something to tell them. Dad's pissed because Mom's making them late. Mom was pissed because she was running late, her shirt was on backwards and she didn't have time to fix it, and the tag was chafing her neck. She spins around, mad as hell, and yells, ""WHAT? What do you want to tell me?""

Forgot what I was going to say... She just held out her hand, and Mom saw the ring.

So Mom starts laughing, and Dad looks like someone kicked him in the stomach - pale, and a weak smile. Hugs all around, my cousin come running in to see what the commotion was about, and then get pissed at us for not telling him before.

Dad says, ""OK - time to go!"", and they leave.

After they come back, Mom told us we ruined Dad's vacation. Five minutes out from the house, the conversation runs like this:

Dad: When did you find out? 

Mom: Just now! When you did! 

Dad: You mean they didn't tell you before?

Mom: No!

Dad: Oh...

Few miles down the road...

Dad: So... is she pregnant?

Mom: How should I know? I just found out about this, too?!?!!?

So Dad spent a week thinking she was knocked up. He called a few times to make sure everything was OK... and never asked us. Guess he was too afraid the answer could have been ""yes.""

She wasn't.

With her visa running out, we tried to get it converted to a student one, but it was a pain. It was easier just to get married by the JP, and be done with it. Dad actually said, ""Well, you gave her a ring, might as well get married...""

It took three weeks from ""serious"" to ""engaged"".
It took a month and a half from ""enagaged"" to ""everyone knows.""
It took two more weeks by the time we got to ""Well, you gave her a ring..."", and two weeks from THAT to get to ""I do.""

Pretty fast, but it worked well for us.

Typical Polish wedding reception - lots to drink, lots of food, long into the night. Typical wedding games, too: the kitchen utensils/hot sausage game, egg game, foot-identification game... Debauchery all around.

Of course, at the reception, Dad just *had* to play the video from 13 years before. Turn out he had been standing on the balcony watching us and taping the crotch-kicking, and he played it for everyone right after we left. My best man thought it was so funny he fell out of his chair laughing. He said it was the most fun he's ever had at a wedding.

Of course, his wife hit him on their drive home. They took a few years to get engaged, and then married... Her words were, ""See? It look them TWO WEEKS!!!!!""

Good times...

So for the first year, the rumors on both sides of the Atlantic were that she:
* was pregnant (Not!)
* was only after a green card (She wants to move to Europe)
* was after the vast family fortune (Ha! Me too!)

The best example of misunderstanding of European socialism is when I have been in discussion with people and I have stated that Tony Blare, Americas best buddy, is or was, the leader of a socialist party and prime minister of GB, they are astounded. Some of the reactions I have had have been laughable and sad at the same time.

A strong democracy can accept all sorts. I bet Americans are not aware the GB was voting in Communist Members of Parliament up until the sixties. Why? Because we were strong enough and open minded enough to give them a platform.

You will see no change in the USA until elected members are not bought off by business interests. That can be done by them declaring an interest and not taking part in the debate or vote on legislation that involves companies and associations that have paid them money.

Currency is MORE stable under gold standard.  It's increase is gradual over time.

&gt;The US dollar would no longer be the currency of choice for buying and selling oil and other commodities. This would cause it to fall out of favor as the choice reserve currency.

Because paper money would not *be* money anymore.  Gold will become money.

True,1426036243,1252007662,7,"You may have an learned an overstated version of the history of Christianity in Rome.

Constantine *was* the first Christian Emperor, but he didn't make Christianity the official religion of the Empire.  That version is based on a credulous interpretation of the *Donation of Constantine*, which purported to have turned over the Empire to the Church.  But the *Donation* was an 8th century forgery.

The big victory for Western Christianity under Constantine was the Edict of Milan  The Edict instituted *toleration* of Christianity, which had previously been suppressed by the Empire, and returned previously confiscated property to Christians.  Constantine *did* throw a great deal of wealth into consolidating Christianity, but most of that was concentrated in the city he founded on the Bosphorus, Constantinople.  It would soon become the capital of the Eastern, or Byzantine, Empire.

You could, perhaps, make the argument that the Orthodox Church control had an early monopoly over religion in the East, but the Roman Senate remained largely pagan, as did the Equestrian class, from which its ranks were largely drawn.  The reach of so-called Imperial Christianity into the Empire outside of the city of Rome was so weak that the Church would spend most of the next six centuries pushing the spread of Christianity into regions that Rome had conquered before the fall.  Constantine's youngest son Constans *did*, in 341, ban pagan sacrifices, but those rights were restored two decades later by the Emperor Julian, who fought to roll back many of the political gains made by Christians since the Edict of Milan.

Most of the remaining Emperors were Christian, but by this time the influence of the Empire was waning.  The Empire split before the end of the century, just 15 years before the Sack of Rome.  Rome controlled less and less of the continent, and the barbarian invasions were rapidly fragmenting the infrastructure that had held the Western Empire together.  There was no consolidated and far-reaching Imperial structure that could enforce a monopoly over religion.  Paganism remained strong, and was certainly still in practice on the Continent during the 8th century when Charlemagne took power.  While the Edict of Milan may serve as the official starting point of what we think of as Christendom (as distinct from Christianity), it was coronation of Charlemagne by Pope Leo III on Christmas Day 800 CE that was the tipping point in making Christianity the dominant religion of Europe -- nearly 500 years *after* Constantine I.

That's 500 years that need to be explained if you're going to maintain the theory that Christianity can't survive without a social monopoly -- in addition to the 300 years in which it survived at the bottom of the Roman social hierarchy.  Prior to Charlemagne's consolidation of Western Europe, there were plenty of other religions practicing on European soil, any one of which might have outstriped Christianity -- Judaism, Avar paganism, Moorish Islam on the Spanish peninsula, and any number of native European paganisms.",t3_9gw6f,c0cqt9c,,False,,,0,atheism,False,t5_2qh2p,0,t1_c0cqncj,7,t1_c0cqt9c,blackstar9000,0

But yes, i agree with you on almost all of your points. Learning is great. I am going to university right now and am enjoying it immensely.  Some people tell me i am a nerd but i maintain that you have to study to be a nerd.  I learn things very easily in that i can simply show up to class and retain almost all of what was taught without any further review. Quite handy really. Of course i do go beyond the classroom.  I probably read an average of ten books a month ranging from science to philosophy to fiction and everything in between.

Earning money is one of the things i have to disagree with though.  I find that money can actually ruin happiness.  Having money causes us to want more and more.  Provided that is possible then it may work, but if ever that money was to run out then you would inevitably be less happy as your happiness is based off of those material possessions.  The way i see it, the only way money makes a person happy is the pursuit of it. The pursuit of a goal is indeed much more satisfying than the time after it has been reached.

I wish i could get a intellectually stimulating job.  My job consists of dealing with upset people and angry animals.  Seeing as how i am still in school though i find it complicated to get a truly intellectually stimulating job.

If by ""you might actually have fun once in a while"" you mean to say that i don't have any fun then you are mistaken.  I do indeed have fun very often. Although i suppose you are right that i could have more fun in more situations if i did drink. Never having tried it i cant really say that you are wrong but part of is i know i have the potential to become addicted to it. I know i have the kind of personality that gets addicted to things easily. Probably a stupid reason, but my brother struggles with that, and i have other extended family that struggle with it as well.  Call me paranoid but thats just me.

And lastly i love to travel.  I havent been nearly enough places to say i  have seen the world but i have seen enough to be in love with traveling.  It is just so dang expensive... I am going to iceland next summer with some friends and possibly on to ireland after that.  I would love to travel asia after that but a need at least a few months for that...  I've been to europe and i find i much prefer a culture that is completely foreign to me than over americanized places in europe.  That is i suppose what i am looking for in asia. Will i find it?

Finally, believe you me i am looking, but i am still left searching for anyone that thinks even remotely similar to how i think.   I dont require them to think exactly like me, that would be silly.  But i would like to be able to have intelligent conversations.  That would be fantastic.

You are comparing countries to continents.  The U.S. is not as great as you think.  IMO the problem the supporters of socialized reform is the exact reason why American think people want to come here: success.  Economic success is ingrained in our minds from childhood.  This is evident in the general American household as evident by the cock measuring (the sizes of our tvs and the cars that we drive).  We stress on personal economic wealth rather than the communal standards of living.  

**I** don't want to pay more taxes is what we are hearing as of late.  Yes its fucking selfish.  Whether you make $1 or $50 more per hour than the next guy does not mean that you and your kids deserve better opportunities like healthcare.  That should be a communal right.

But to use your flawed example, yes you deserve the opportunity to work for your 70 inch television.  The guy on the beach will not get his free from the government.  That is not the current state of socialist thought.

There is a reason why what the general American consensus of socialism is actually called *utopian socialism* by academia which is set totally apart from Classical Marxism, Leninism, Maoism, etc.  

&gt;Eventually that imbalance spirals out of control until you get to a state where there is not enough food and other necessities to even survive.

This has not been proven and don't even dare point to the USSR under Stalin, that was not socialism and has been penned Stalinism, closer to totalitarianism.  In fact, 19th century socialists understood how quickly a state could fall into dictatorship as it sought its path to Communism.  So please avoid making assumptions.

Despite their problems, Western Europe has maintained a fairly reasonable balance ensuring their people liberties that American's won't get to enjoy until we stop focusing on ourselves and instead the bettering of our society.",t3_9goqc,c0cqzxe,,False,,,0,AskReddit,False,t5_2qh1i,0,t1_c0cqovr,2,t1_c0cqzxe,FiniteCircle,0

I am sorry but I couldn't disagree more. My point was socialism, capitalism, they are economic philosophies. Americans always talk about freedom. I would really like to hear a definition of what this means cause I am not sure. Honestly, I feel like it is just some political buzz word with no true meaning. I mean If i say I represent freedom, people hear well I like being free, ya this is great, but does it really mean anything?? (rhetorical question)

Really (and I am not joking), I am not sure what tAmericans mean when they say they wanna be free. I mean would you consider EU member states free (most have quite social democratic political philosophies), how about Canada, or what about Singapore (often argued as an example of a benevolent dictatorship). Now what about Somalia. A true free market enconomy with no government. You want security, buy protection from the warlords. No taxes, no functioning government, freedom to do whatever you want, as long as you can pay for it. Is that freedom? Or is only the US free? Whatever that means.....

&gt; Under socialism you are your brothers keeper. Society makes a claim on your life. It is a form of Serfdom. You are not property of a sovereign, but instead you are the property of your neighbor. And your neighbor is likewise your property. Because you are bound to each other in responsibility you suddenly have a philosophical stake in the decisions you each make.

Please repeat after me. Socialism DOES NOT equal Communism. Repeat again. They are different ideologies. Socialism understand personal property rights. Generally a socialist rejects the ideas of a class struggle. 

Now I am not anti-capitalist, not a communist, not a socialist. Capitalism is driven by individual choices, with disregard to the greater good of society.I think the free market has its role in certain sectors, but fails in others. In some sectors, such as fire protection, police, military, health, I think the rights of everybody, out way the rights of the individual. Now we have had public fire protection for a long time, so (almost) nobody would argue with me here, why can't other see the similarity when applied to health. 

A Private fire protection system was attempted (see new york in the mid 1800s), it failed miserably, a private health care system is ongoing in the US right now... how is it doing?

I mean please even just check wikipedia. All I ask is people educate themselves about the meaning of words. Words can be a beautiful thing, as long as you understand their meaning..

From Wikipedia:

In general, contemporary social democrats support:

    * A mixed economy consisting of both private enterprise and publicly owned or subsidized programs of education, health care, child care and related social services for all citizens.
    * An extensive system of social security (although usually not to the extent advocated by socialists), with the stated goal of counteracting the effects of poverty and insuring the citizens against loss of income following illness, unemployment or retirement.
    * Government bodies that regulate private enterprise in the interests of workers and consumers by ensuring labor rights (i.e. supporting worker access to trade unions), consumer protections, and fair market competition.
    * Environmentalism and environmental protection laws; for example, funding for alternative energy resources and laws designed to combat global warming.
    * A value-added/progressive taxation system to fund government expenditures.
    * A secular and a socially progressive policy.
    * Immigration and multiculturalism.
    * Fair trade over free trade.
    * A foreign policy supporting the promotion of democracy, the protection of human rights and where possible, effective multilateralism.
    * Advocacy of social justice, human rights, social rights, civil rights and civil liberties.

None of that looks to evil or too stifling of freedom to me......

A good chunk of European commmunist parties were actually formed as splinter groups from socialist parties that left Comintern and where the remaining part supported social democracy.

[Most of those social democratic parties are today members of the Socialist International](http://www.socialistinternational.org/viewArticle.cfm?ArticlePageID=931), and they make up the majority of members of the Socialist International though there are members that belong to other reformist socialist ideologies as well.

Many of these parties are explicitly *named* socialist parties - the French Socialist Party for example.

Some Muslim women wear no head covering at all, some wear a scarf, some cover their face. I can't speak for France, but in America, those that cover anything at all are more likely the product of individual choice than not. 

Also, to say this is a practice rooted in male ownership of women is absurb. First, many of these women are not married and the rule is the same. Second, up until recently, within the last 150 years or so, many European women were owned by their husbands as a matter of law when that has not been the case in Arabian societies for about 1400 years. The idea that beauty and sexuality belongs to a marital relationship and not in the public space is not the same thing as ownership. I wonder if this isn't a European overreaction to their own more recent oppressive laws towards women. 

Also, I take much more offense to the supposedly modern idea of stripping women down for the enjoyment of men. It's a much more insidious kind of patriarchy. Women are pressured into not leaving the house without makeup, wearing high heels, dressing sexy, keeping their bodies like the covers of magazines in grocery store checkouts across America.

I grew up pretty poor, and I spent a good portion of my adult life thus far hovering around or below the poverty line. I have worked really hard, defied the odds, and managed to work my way up into the middle-middle class (for my region), and I am also one of the few people in my family to attend and graduate from college. An education that I paid for myself as I managed to fit a perfect set of technicalities which resulted in very very little student aid.

True,1426037416,1252115652,1,"last thing before i'm done for the weekend:

trade secrets are only good for things that aren't easily reverse engineered. things like recipes. by essentially placing an additional requirement that all new ideas, in order to be profitable, be difficult to reverse engineer, you run the risk of stifling innovation.

&gt;A woman does just as much, if not more, to ""create"" a child as a human does to ""create"" a new idea, does this entail a right of the woman to claim ownership over the child? Perhaps you believe that children are fundamentally different than ideas in a way relevant here, and thus they are exempt where ideas are not. If so, I would grant you that much, but only after noting that being responsible for the creation of a given thing does not necessarily constitute a claim for dominion, since we already know of exceptions.

The woman creating the child could even fall into the system I have laid out, but the child would be an unprotectable form of new information since every member of the human race essentially has the same capability to create children, and because creating children will happen even in the presence of rules forbidding their creation. It actually might be useful to think of ideas as being analogous to children, though, in the sense that there are certain things you allow children to do and there are certain things you tell them they are not allowed to do. In fact, I'm sure many inventors and scientists have thought of their ideas as children. In 20 years, the children grow up and anyone can use them for anything.

&gt;What if you ""create"" such an idea and exert your control over it by refusing to share it? Then, years later, someone else ""creates"" the exact same idea, but does share it, being rewarded in the process. Given that you seem to think you have absolute dominion over your own creation, do you have a just claim to the exact same idea created independently by this second party? If not, what if you had written it in a diary, or sent it to yourself sealed in the mail but never shared it, so that your originality was unquestioned. Would this circumstance give you claim to dominion over the idea?

I think I addressed this point, but I will elaborate again here. In such cases that ideas are independently arrived at, but the idea is still sufficiently complex as to suggest that only a few members of a large set of population might independently arrive at it, the idea essentially falls between the two models I laid out (ideas are invented vs. ideas are discovered), and the system of resolution for this special case currently is ""first to invent"". In Europe and other countries, rights are given to the ""first to file"". (I could have this backwards, but the point is that a system of resolution for such a case already exists).

As for obviousness of patents, here is how that works (I didn't write this):
A patent is obvious if what is claimed is novel (see previous question), but the novel aspects were not the result of any inventive activity. For example, the claimed invention has one element that does not occur in a first prior art document, but it is common general knowledge that that one element could be added. Generally, it is required to show some kind of hint towards adding that element, or modifying an existing element, before that adding or modifying is considered obvious.

The main problem with obviousness is that you very easily reason with the benefit of hindsight. This is not permitted. You must base your arguments entirely on the prior art, without knowledge of the invention. With hindsight, it is almost always possible to present a series of modifications to a prior art system that result in the claimed invention.

As for ideas existing before they enter the minds of humans: the argument has been made many times and much more elegantly than I can make it here. Here's a quick article about the very subject: http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2008/04/is-mathematics.html

I would also argue that ownership of ideas is deeply embedded in many cultures as evidenced by the names of many elements, phenomena, formulas, and principles. Not only is it like that in our culture, but many other cultures, sufficiently complex, have this feature of associating people and their ideas with one another.

I have tried to be impartial, but ultimately I know I cannot be. My grandfather, uncle, father, and brother are all researchers for a living, in both the public and private sector (physics, electrical engineering, mechanical and aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, respectively). Patents protect their work and earn them money. I have no financial incentive to give up this system. ",t3_9guzb,c0csma0,,False,,,0,technology,False,t5_2qh16,0,t1_c0csht8,1,t1_c0csma0,[deleted],0

The French eat fatty and unhealthy food and have a generally low incidence of heart disease and are the thinnest people in Europe to boot (however even that paradox is now being called into question).  The Eskimo-diet represents another highly controversial issue for modern health advice.

I tend to distrust anything health or fitness related being sold to me.  Humans did not evolve to eat extracted this and purified that.  Nor is it reasonable to suggest that we should eat exactly this many eggs and that many tomatoes each week.

In analysing what is good or bad for human health, it is probably sensible to look to the past.  How did humans evolve to live?  What are the optimal conditions for the human body, both in terms of diet and energy expenditure?  These are sensible questions to ask when evaluating health ""truths"".  It is likely that most of the controversial issues you've raised above are half-truths.  These are all basic science questions, all were conditions early man had to deal with (except perhaps vegetable oil), and all are likely to have specific genetic adaptations in man to deal with them.  Be wary of anything controvertial on either side.

Cholesterol bad?  I very much doubt it.  Mankind evolved to eat meat (not solely, we are omnivores after all).  He followed his prey and did this for several million years.  No, it is simply very unlikely that it is as simple as ""Cholesterol bad"".  It is far more likely to be ""Cholesterol beneficial in low doses, bad in high doses"".  Even there, this has exceptions.  Eskimos eat huge quantities of fat to virtually no apparent ill-affect.  There must be some specific adaptation in the human genome to allow such a diet to work.  It is just downright naive to believe that the answer to Cholesterol is simply good or bad.

We like to look for simple answers to complex questions.  The answer to living a healthy, strong, and energetic life would be so much simpler if we could just boil it down to a set of simple rules that we can follow like automatons.  Unfortunately, we not automatons.  We have to adapt, survive, deal with disease, our environment, circumstance.  All these things interfere with just picking some idealised set of rules we can all just blithely follow.  I say let's be sensible.  Let's eat lower on the food chain.  Eat raw food.  Eat in sensible proportions.  Remember that man adapted to survive with famine better than feast!  Then we can hope find the healthy, fit, and long life rules that we should follow.  Anything else is just wishful thinking.

&gt;Skinhead - n. Slang. - Member of an international youth subculture characterized by hair and dress styles evoking aggression and physical toughness. Typical skinhead style includes shaved heads, combat boots, tattoos, and prominent body piercings. Skinheads first appeared in working-class areas of London in the 1960s; during the 1970s and '80s the skinhead phenomenon spread to Australia, North America, and western Europe. In many countries, skinheads are regarded as extreme right-wing nationalists who espouse anti-Semitic and other racist views and engage in violent attacks on immigrants and racial minorities. This characterization, however, does not apply to all members of the subculture.

&gt;Many of them were soon drawn into extreme nationalist, and especially anti-immigrant, groups. Some skinheads were recruited as “storm troopers” for neo-Nazi organizations, and the movement became increasingly politicized. Skinhead gangs often attacked immigrants or racial minorities, particularly Turks and Asians in Germany and Indians and Pakistanis in Britain. 


No where does it say ""there is no such thing as a racist skinhead"". In fact, it says there is such a thing. I respect the SkinHeads Against Racial Prejudice (SHARPs) but there are racist ""Skinheads"" by definition. ",t3_9gusu,c0csxc0,,False,,,0,IAmA,False,t5_2qzb6,0,t1_c0cswsz,3,t1_c0csxc0,natezomby,0

Arresting officers were sentenced to 60 day-fines (between $7 and $140 each, depending on income) for letting the police dog bite Osmo, but were apparently freed from charges of misconduct.

* During the riots at the EU meeting in Gothenburg in 2001, Hannes Westberg was shot by police, causing life-threatening injury, but in the end survived with only the loss of a kidney. Two other people were slightly hurt by riccochets. Hannes was throwing stones at the police. Hannes was sentenced to prison for violent rioting, the case against the police was dropped. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj6zu8j3YkY&amp;feature=channel#t=0m23s

* In 2009 controversy was caused by a policeman in Rosengård, Malmö, talking about an immigrant boy, ""The little monkey bastard. Shall I make him sterile when I get him?"" I believe he was freed from charges since the statement wasn't meant to be heard by anyone else. At the same time, a 15-year old boy was sentenced to a $28 fine for saying ""oink oink"" to a policeman.

1. You have the right to own land and build on it

2. You can own your own business and provide any services/products you want (short of nuclear plants, private armies, environmental-safety hazards)

3. You can sell your products/services for prices agreed by your customers without state intervention (e.g. state cannot force you to sell cars, electronics at a fixed state price)

PROS - By European standards, Americans have a high standard of living.  

1. Single-family homes with lawns are the norm, even for the working class.  One bathroom per person is common.
2. Most families have 1 car per adult.  
3. Consumer goods are available cheaply and in huge quantities.  
4. Food is cheap and plentiful.  
5. Taxes are low.  
6. Bureaucracy is minimal.

CONS - By European standards, Americans have a low standard of living.

1. Violent crime is a big problem.  Firearms are plentiful and easy to get.  
2. Public schools are poorly funded and run.  In many locales, a private school is essentially mandatory.
3. Health care can only be had with private insurance, which is generally paid for by one's employer.  Unfortunately, many employers do not provide insurance.
4. The average American is religious and provincial. 
5. Most places in America are fully car-dependent.  You will *need* a car, and will have to drive children everywhere.  All these cars result in huge areas given up to roads, and, in larger cities, terrible traffic.
6. The cheap, plentiful food is of inferior quality (think white bread and potato chips).  
7. The cheap, plentiful consumer goods are of inferior quality (mass-produced in China).  

People with education and jobs live very well in the US.  Poor people do much worse than their European counterparts.

I applied in 2002.  What I did was write a short story of about 40 paragraphs.  It was about one of those Japanese officers in WWII on a remote island who thought the war was still on.  I placed a Japanese officer in the middle of a remote Pacific island with four towns representing major players in the Cold War (USSR, China, Europe, USA).  He lived in the wilderness around those villages and foraged.  Each town reacted to him in ways analogous to their foreign policies.  (China left him alone and focused on internal matters, for instance.)

I bought a large book of heavy paper.  I transcribed the story by hand, a paragraph per page.  Each paragraph began with an illustration in the box.  Each illustration was a picture representing the first letter of the paragraph and showing something that happened in the paragraph.

Socialism is what brings balance. Indeed, it means that the means of production and distribution are controlled by ""the state"". To some degree. (By the way, ""the state"" consists of democratically elected people).

The market forces of supply and demand apply everywhere, regardless of the economic and political system. This means that ""full"" socialism is impossible. Every system has to reckon with the market forces, because they are like a law of physics, you can't undo them.

Socialism balances the market forces in such a way that not just the super rich (old money and corporations) benefit from economic activity. Everyone works for it, why shouldn't everyone profit?

Countries with the highest standards of living are the countries that use socialism to balance the market forces (mostly Western European countries and Scandinavia).

The farmer has no hay to feed the cow and his religion forbids him from eating it. The cow dies. The man dies. The dictator confiscates the dead man's farm and sells it, using the money to purchase US military equipment. The President declares the program a success and announces closer ties with our new ally.

Bureaucracy, American-Style: You have two cows but you have to kill one of them because the government will only give you a license for one of them. The license requires you to sell all your milk to the government, which uses it to make cheese. The government pays lots of money to store the cheese in refrigerated warehouses. When the cheese spoils, the government distributes it to the poor. The poor get sick from the cheese, go to the emergency room, and are turned away because they have no health insurance. The President declares the program a success and reminds us that we have the finest health care system in the world.

American Corporation: You have two cows. You sell one to a subsidiary company and lease it back to yourself so you can declare it as a tax loss. Your bosses give you a huge bonus. You inject the cows with drugs and they produce four times the normal amount of milk. Your bosses give you a huge bonus. When the drugs cause one of the cows to drop dead you announce to the press that you have down-sized, reducing expenses by 50 percent. The company stock goes up and your bosses give you a huge bonus. You lay off all your workers and move your production facilities to Mexico. You get a huge bonus. You contribute some of your profit to the President's re-election campaign. The President announces tax cuts for corporations in order to stimulate the economy.

Japanese Corporation: You have two cows. You redesign them so they are one-tenth the size of an ordinary cow and produce twenty times the milk. You teach the cows to travel on unbelievably crowded trains. Your cows always get higher test scores than cows in the U.S. or Europe, but they drink a lot of sake.

True,1426037859,1252175102,3,"To me, it depends on the individual voice actor.


I try to watch dubs to get an idea of what they're like when I'm introducing friends to anime series I've enjoyed.  My complaint against dubs is when unrelated traits get introduced to the voices.

I was displeased by the casting of Alphonse (Aaron Dismuke) in the English dub of Full Metal Alchemist (original series).

He is the second main voice role but instead of sounding like a giant suit of armor with a very sympathetic character, they made it sound as if he had a southern twang and lacked all sense of the tragic experience he had when he lost his human body.

The setting of the story is similar to Europe during the industrial revolution.  I admit the Japanese aren't always 100% historically/culturally accurate, but their choice of adding wrong Japanese dialects (Kansai in a futuristic story where the character is an android for example) is slightly less obvious to my American ears.

But when I can detect cliché Western accents that don't match the character, I get annoyed quickly.

It's like trying to watch The Dark Knight when Batman's voice doesn't match.

If they added a southern twang or ""Californian surfer vibe"" to Batman's voice, I think all of us would agree that it was a terrible joke.

But if you were sincere you would have to acknowledge the other purposes, to grab more land and cut Palestinians off from each other.

You are being attacked for your one sided blinkered attitude.
the intitives for peace lie within Israels remit.   

I'll repost what see as the situation.

Israel is the regional power. It is the big mean dog, it has all that it wants, the land, military dominance over all its neighbors, trade, the coverage of the worlds only super power. Therefore Israel wants to maintain the current power status quo as is. Israel wants to impose its will on a defeated people and call this peace Those who rule others always want that kind of peace.

I dont expect everyone, particularly you, to agree with the Palestinian POV but at least to understand it.

Palestinians do not place the same premium on peace the Israelis do. This is because they have very little. They have issues that need addressing, the right of return, the occupation of the West Bank, the annexation of Jerusalem, the economic shut down, the total control and blockade of their areas. They see peace as surrender. This is why they keep firing rockets and launching suicide attack. They want justice. The ruled always do.

To get Peace the Israelis have to address issues they simply do not want to. Until Israel is prepared to do that, there will not be peace.

It can be done, The UK showed the way when it talked to the IRA with no pre-condtions. No, ""edit the United Ireland part of your charter"" before we talk. The commander of the Londonderry IRA is now a UK member of parliament and Northern Ireland is still a part of the UK. By talking to the extremists, you fractionalise them, those that want peace, and those that want to fight. To strengthen the hand of those that want peace serious concessions have to be made, when those that want to derail the peace talks strike with rocket attacks and car bombs you have to be very careful with retaliation. Its a long slow road, but there was a time when Northern Ireland looked as hopeless as Palestine, but look at it now.

The PLO was willing to change its charter and recognize Israel, didn't get them anywhere...

The solution to the problems obvious. All the peace plans are essentially the same. Clinton's Peace Plan, the Nusseiba-Ayalon Plan, the Saudi Peace Initiative, Bush’s Road Map, Oslo, Taba summit are all similar

They all include clear measures that Israel has to take in order to make peace:

1.Dismantle the settlements.  
2.Withdraw its soldiers and civilians from the occupied territories,  
3.Allow the creation a viable Palestinian state.      
4.find a solution for the Palestinian refugees' right of return. A massive compensation package?  
5.Find a way to guarantee Israeli security. Altho' I believe having nuke addresses that.  
6.A creative way to reward Israel for giving up what it feels it has won in war.

The problem is Israel will not to go along with these plans. At some point the talks will fail. Developing new plans is a waste of time. Israel wants land, specifically the West Bank. Israel has not dismantled a single settlement built there, and has never ceased to take Palestinian lands under the guise of security. This is the underlying tactic. The aim is to create a ""reality on the ground"" where it become impossible to uproot 100,000's of settlers. The Palestinians will become a servant population within this greater Israel ruled by a compliant Palestinian authority.  

My greatest insight occurred while living in Israel.
I came to realize Israel is a typical colonialist project.
Europeans jews using American Jewish wealth, politics and violence to transfer a native population from their land using using a tried and true tactic.
You start friendly, grow in strength, then remove more natives, when they see what is happening and they resist play the ""we are the victims of native violence"" card and use greater violence to remove greater numbers. Continue until you got all you want.

Even if it is good now, it will not stay that way without significant overhaul.  In fact, all of the best social programs in European countries are running deficits year after year.  That doesn't mean the US system is better (it isn't), it just means that we don't want to be emulating unsustainable programs, especially on a scale this massive.  Our medicare, medicaid and social security programs represent the majority of our obligations.  They dwarf all other obligations, even our defense budget.

Sure, there is great resistance to removing the NHS, but it's a fiscal failure.  You can't run a program on hopes and dreams and pretend it will work; it has to be fiscally prudent as well, because if it runs deficits year after year your children will be enslaved by the god-state mentality.  This mentality is the very same mentality that is turning your country into a surveilliance society, as well as ours, but few Brits seem to see that the concept of a maternal government eventually leads to such things.  

I don't see the use of socialized medicine if it leads to an unfree country.  I would rather be free and dying of some strange disease or injury than be enslaved and well treated by my master.  Fortunately there's a way out of both problems.  With a free market in health care and an emphasis on charity, people will be able to remain free AND care for the poor.  

Our health care system was the best in the world before the government interfered in it, and that interference has resulted in disaster.  If you doubt that, look at other countries where there is a freer market than the european nations, than ours, and it should be plainly obvious that they're better than all of the socialized systems, ours included. 

And yes, ours is a socialized system by half.  48% of our spending on health care is for government programs and, like the NHS, they're all running huge unsustainable deficits.  You cannot fix this by forcing more people into these programs.  You can only fix the allocation problem by allowing the actors themselves to self-allocate.

No, it does not. Not at all, not even close. Why make a claim about a link when the claim is so clearly false?

&gt;What you may not know, however, is that WHO, together with health officials, regulatory authorities and vaccine manufacturers, have been working since 2007 – long before this new “threat” of swine flu emerged – to “explore a broad range of issues surrounding the regulatory approval of pandemic vaccines.” 

Well good for them. I am glad that someone actually tried to prepare for a problem rather than simply panicking when it was too late.

&gt;One such method used in Europe is to conduct advance studies using a “mock-up” vaccine that contains an active ingredient for an influenza virus that has not circulated recently in human populations.

&gt;When testing these mock-up vaccines, it is very possible to release the novel influenza virus into the population, as its purpose is to “mimic the novelty of a pandemic virus” and “greatly expedite regulatory approval.”

How did you go from ""old"" virus to ""novel"" virus? And the goal is to get approval of the vaccine by showing that it is safe. How is that a problem?

&gt;Labeling the vaccine a “strain change” rather than an entirely “new” vaccine. This method states the new vaccine has built on technology used to produce vaccines for seasonal influenza, and the change for the pandemic vaccine is similar to a strain change used to produce a new seasonal vaccine each flu season.

Yes, so? What precisely is your problem with this?

* Everyone is a fuck up, but some people are better at hiding it or just not worrying about it.
* You are both smarter and dumber than you realize.
* You can get better at pretty much anything with practice.  Most people who seem to be ""natural"" at something only seem that way because they have had a lot of practice.
* You're going to keep getting wiser about things.  You may think of yourself as pretty smart now, and an adult, but you'll look back and realize how naïve you were.  Always.  At 25, you'll think you were naïve and foolish at 16, and at 36, you'll know how little you really understood at 25.
* The ""life decisions"" you think matter a lot (e.g., which college to go to, which job to take) often really don't.  Often you can spend time agonizing over a decision, but much of the time you are choosing between ""good"" options and either option will actually make you happy.
* To make those life decisions, ask people about their experiences; because listening to them describe what it is like to do something is much more accurate than just trying to imagine it.  Be on the lookout for things that resonate with you, seem like they'd be cool or fun (or horrible).  But you should mostly ignore advice about which option you should choose from people who say *X* is better than *Y* when they haven't tried *Y* (e.g., to decide whether to go to Europe or South America, don't just talk to someone who went to Europe and says that's the best thing to do; don't decided to go to grad school solely because someone with a Ph.D. thinks you should).
* Things that seem totally beyond your reach *can* be done;  you never have to do the whole thing at once, you just figure out the next step forward and do that, and eventually you get there.
* In college/university, you'll have more freedom than you do later on when you have a job.  Try to enjoy it.
* You aren't necessarily the person that knows you best, you're on the inside, but you're stuck in now with only your own memory (which is hugely influenced by your current state of mind) to go on.  You're not always the best judge of what will make you happy.
* Try to say ""Yes"" to things.  You'll go to more parties, meet more people, try more new things.
* You aren't invincible.  Dumb actions that could screw up your later life probably don't seem nearly as foolish as they should, so try to compensate.
* Anything that can mean anything really means nothing (which means that you should distrust most religion).

True,1426038933,1252284657,1,"&gt;The reason people are voting for the BNP is because they're scared for their inner city communities. Many have changed beyond recognition in the last 20 years, in Birmingham, and Peterborough, and other parts of London.

I'm not sure this is true, mainly because we are seeing BNP support in areas where immigrant populations are both long lived and fairly stagnant (i.e. they are not a recent and growing phenomenon).  I would suggest instead that some people are reacting as they often do in a recession and looking for scape-goats. Immigrants make easy targets in that whether they are Asian or Polish.  

Secondly recent election successes can probably be put down to disenchantment with the mainstream parties, most of the traditional Labour people I know who didn't vote Labout voted 'Green' in the EU elections, whilst those more conservatives people I know voted UKIP, BNP and Conservative.

Thirdly, the BNP are also moderating their public positions.  I actually had someone suggest that they aren't racist anymore, just xenophobic... In either case it does seem that they are being seen as more acceptable and possibly even as being the victims of oppression. 

As to the way you describe the immigration process as being extremely rapid at present, well that is true, but it isn't all that different to how it has happened in the past.  We seem to see immigration in waves, with those that remain becoming more integrated over time.  People fail to see that of course, and it tallies with when there has previously been more or less support for groups like the BNP (or indeed the NF).

&gt;I think many voters of the BNP just want their requests to be heard,

I think this may be a little generous, I don't think that there is no choice on the issues amongst the other parties, or that the BNP offers more chance for moderate positions to be heard (although that may be the perception now...).  I would suggest that the vast majority support the BNP's aims or at least their understanding of them.

&gt;I know it's not a popular stance - but most of the runners for our government are too attracted by the big salary and massive retirement fund to rock any kind of boat - educational, social, our 'special' relationship with the US (in what way!?), with the armed forces.... the list covers all aspects of control the government has.

I would probably say that this is a little false.  In education terms (and indeed health and social terms) we have seen big swings in policy over the years, the support for the Military has been an ongoing constant, but hardly one matched by policy either.  As to the special relationship, well we will see, it is the one area where there really is no difference between any of the parties, no one seems to have noticed quite how one sided and counter productive it has become.

&gt;We need some leaders that aren't in it for the money.

I think most MPs aren't.  The issue with the expenses thing and even salaries is less about money and more about people being people.  If you can vote yourself a pay rise and really think you are doing a good job, you probably will.  As it was in the MP's case , most thought that they were under paid, and in lieu of pay increases the expenses thing got ludicrous.   It isn't comparable to a proper corruption scandal, nor do I see it as an indicator of 'the rot setting in'.  There were those who were somewhat excessive and they indeed may be seen as having taken the piss, but most of the claims were moderately sensible and other issues were the kind of thing you would expect an accountant to do...

As to vocations, well there I do agree with you, we could pay MP's less, we could certainly remove their privileges, I don't even think it would be disastrous or lead to the best people not becoming MP's (power attracts after all), but I think it might not do the kind of good you expect.

&gt; The death toll among tourist to Thailand every year amounts to more than 2-times the number of deaths from the Bali bomb attacks and this just from their own recklessness and stupidity, says Steven Martin, co-author of the Lonely Planet guide book to Thailand.

&gt; Thai mortician Hirun Phurdnampetch, who has spent more than two decades dealing with the remains of dead tourists from Europe and the United States, has a similar message: When a foreigner dies it is usually on a motorbike, riding without skill or protective clothing and usually in the most popular places such as Pattaya, Phuket and Koh Samui, with heart attacks during special in-bedroom activities the second biggest cause of death, Hirun Phurdnampetch said.

True,1426038993,1252290771,2,"I tried to explain why I calculated the tax as inclusive rather than exclusive.  You are right, that with current sales taxes, on a $100 item, a 25% sales tax would mean the item costs $125. This is because the tax is added at the time of purchase.  With the Fair Tax, the tax is already included in the price.  You pay whatever is on the price tag.  The seller is the responsible for giving a percentage of that to the government.  Using the same example, you pay the vendor $125, and the vendor gives the governement $25, which is 25/125 or 20%.  

This is the same way income tax is calculated.  If you make $125 a year, and you pay 20% in tax, you pay 20% of $125, or $25.  Consider a paycheck stub.  If you made $125 a year, but had the IRS take out $25 each check, your take home pay would be $100.  Now, you paid $25 in taxes, but you wouldn't calculate your tax rate based on your take home pay. If you did that, your tax rate would be $25/$100, or 25%.  Of course, that doesn't make sense, cause your rate should be based as a percentage of your total income, not as a percentage added on to your income.  The same with the Fair Tax, the rate is a percentage of the final price, not a percentage added on to the final price.

You bring up a good point about where the money of a prebate would go.  It is very likely that some people will blow their prebate much like many people blow their tax refund (eventhough the refund is THEIR money that the government has been earning interest on all year).  Worse than just blowing it on non-necessities would be spending it on drugs or other things detrimental to their health or well-being.

That being said, I can't accept the excuse that it's a bad idea because some people lack the ability to manage it.  Certainly, this is a valid concern, but I think it's one that could be addressed without throwing out the whole thing, whether it be through financial planning and education being made available, or by making the prebate a debit card system like food stamps that can only be spent on certain items.  Of course the problem with restricting the prebate is that it restricts it for everyone.  I don't think any system is perfect, but I would prefer this system if given the choice.

As for tourism, many European countries have a VAT which is sales tax.  That means that every visitor in the country who purchases souvenirs, food, clothing, etc pays into their tax pool.  We would simply be taking advantage of what they are already doing.

As for black-market products, you should remember that every product legally sold in the US would have the same tax built into it, including raw materials for bootlegged or knock-off products.  Boot-leggers wouldn't be able to increase their margin on knock-offs.",t3_9gzud,c0curs5,,False,,,0,reddit.com,False,t5_6,0,t1_c0cujtw,2,t1_c0curs5,Nickbou,0

*A new study shows a direct link between standard childhood vaccination series, MMR, and autism-like symptoms in monkeys. The principal scientist involved in the study, Dr. Laura Hewitson of the University of Pittsburgh, presented the alarming conclusions as an abstract pending publication at the International Meeting for Autism Research. It has been presented at scientific conferences in both London and Seattle, USA.* Wow, an unpublished abstract that was presented at two conferences - why, that's basically a published article from *Nature*

*The study compared vaccinated macaque monkeys with non-vaccinated macaques.* n=?
*No major flaws in the study have been revealed by any attending scientist.* [citation needed]  - what is this supposed to mean, nobody at the conference where this was presented actually stood up and shouted 'heretic!' ?
*The vaccines included the popular MMR series. The study found a marked increase in “gastrointestinal tissue gene expression” and “inflammation issues” with those monkeys which received vaccinations.* std=?
*They are a common symptom of children with regressive autism.* They are also common symptoms of any condition affecting the gastrointestinal tissue.

Can we assume this 'study' has paradigmatic validity? Are macaque monkeys the same as human babies? Are they close on the evolutionary tree? Do they have the same genome for said expressed genes?

*The study also found marked behavior changes* [what changes] *and development differences* [what differences] *in those monkeys given the vaccines versus those who were not. “Compared with unexposed animals, significant neuro-developmental deficits* [what deficits] *were evident for exposed animals in survival reflexes, tests of color discrimination and reversal, and learning sets,” the study`s authors reported.* are these related to autism or any defined developmental disorder? *“Differences in behaviors were observed between exposed and unexposed animals and within the exposed group before and after MMR vaccination.”*
Sorry, differences were observed *before and after* vaccination the 'exposed' group? Exposed to what, the vaccine? Before and after.... having the vaccine? WTF?

*US Government-mandated research approved by Congress was to begin this year, but the funds were rescinded in early January. Claiming “conflict of interest” because of ongoing court cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a long-time supporter of infant vaccinations, withdrew the research plans.*
What does this paragraph even mean? What research into what? It was government mandated, but the CDC (a long 'supporter' of vaccinations, how unusual) withdrew research plans.... for what? ""vaccines""?

*The most shocking of all is the recent and now common medical practice, reinforced by an aggressive pharmaceutical industry,* [citation needed] *of giving multiple vaccines, often virtually within hours of birth, to infants despite the fact that no study including all of the vaccine series commonly given to children in the US and UK, about 30 in all, has been conducted until now.* [citation needed]
This is only shocking if you first accept that giving vaccines at birth is shocking, which is now presupposed in the article, since it's attacking vaccines.
*The practice of newborn multiple vaccinations has become widespread in Germany and other EU countries over the past decade. Significantly there have surfaced reports of dramatically increased instances of autism in newborn and infants in various German hospitals over the past decade, precisely the period multiple vaccinations of newborn and infants has become routine.*
Repeat after me, **CORRELATION DOES NOT SUGGEST CAUSATION**
Do you know that violent crime overall has reduced since the release of Doom I, and has continued to decrease with the introduction of Doom II, Doom III, and the GTA series? Why, *obviously this means that violent videogames reduce crime*, naturally!

*Tragically, the US Government agency theoretically entrusted with guarding public health,* - no, actually, literally, entrusted with guarding the public health, as in, created to do this - *the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as with the case of health dangers of GMO foods,* [citation needed] *as well with the dramatic evidence of the link between autism and adjuvants used in typical vaccines,* [citation needed] *is accepting the argument of big and politically powerful Pharmaceutical companies.* [citation needed]

Social democrats also promote tax-funded welfare programs and regulation of markets. **Many social democrats, particularly in European welfare states, refer to themselves as socialists, introducing a degree of ambiguity to the understanding of what the term means**. Libertarian socialism (including social anarchism and libertarian Marxism) rejects state control and ownership of the economy altogether and advocates direct collective ownership of the means of production via co-operative workers' councils and workplace democracy.

True,1426039540,1252333025,1,"I'd say that 'a commitment between two people' is the baseline for what a marriage is. As you say about word-wars, if we differ in our understanding to that level, then we're not really talking about the same thing.

That said, I think we're closer to agreeing than maybe you do. Maybe I should define my current situation in case it's different where you are - I'm unsure what options are open to you and your location. 

I'm British and live in the UK (under England-and-Wales law, to be exact). Here, a hetro couple can have a civil marriage and a homo one a civil partnership. Other than the name, these are identical. Many places can register to be able to conduct 'civil ceremonies' - hotels, grand castles, fields with a nice view, etc. Churches, temples and synagogues can also offer marriages. In other words, a civil ceremony is obligatory, but it can be combined within a religious one.

I disagree with the difference in name, but other than that, hetro and homo couples are offered the same contract, with the same rights and obligations. I think this is a good situation. Is it that far from what you are proposing?

Now, here are some noun-verb reasons why I believe it's unlikely that as a culture we would turn marriage from a ""legal-religious-societal-personal"" hybrid into just a legal contract. 

* I'm not sure if this is possible in the US, but in the UK and many other European countries certainly (YMMV) there *is* a separation between legal and religious marriage. However, if I were to get married in a field and have my friend officiate, without a state approval of this ceremony, few would accept this as a 'real' marriage any more than I am married to Vicky, a girl I played house with aged 6. So state approval matters, if only for the mundane side of things such as who gets the house when you die, who has authority over your spouse, children, etc. I know it's not romantic, but it's practical.

* Why would it happen? I take your point that it's desirable to you, and no doubt to many others. But I'd wager that the overwhelming majority would see this as diminishing their own relationship. In other words, it ain't a vote-winner. There's no _reason_ for politicians to tamper with such a fundamental thread in people's lives.

* I hope, one day, to get married. Most people do. Whether that's societal conditioning, peer pressure, whatever - something that is desirable both from a personal and community level is unlikely to be destroyed without good reason - and the fact that gay people want to get married strengthens this, rather than weakening it.

&gt; The whole reason people are against same-sex marriage is the way it is being bulldozed through as 'equality', when even if you can't pinpoint why, it clearly isn't the case.

Could you explain more here?

Check out this [BBC report](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3423159.stm). Since then not a lot has changed. 

Similarly, the film starts out with a series of scenes of people with freak medical accidents (I think one person had over five heart attacks) and act like this is normal, which is disingenuous. 

He also misses the point about how the entire tort system is the US would need to be reformed in order to reduce malpractice law suits in order to bring the cost of a single payer system down. This is a big difference between the US and other countries and it won't change over night (and it is a very complex issue because it effects more than just malpractice). 

Furthermore, the US drug companies profit model would need to completely change, resulting in rising costs across the board. The reason things are the way they are now is because the US wants to keep the hundreds of jobs and billions of dollars the drug companies create here in the America. If we changed the law, making it so they must give us the same deals as every other country, many would leave. This is why Obama is making deals with drug companies without outright forcing them to lower their prices through legislation (so far).

[It doesn't bypass safety testing. (PDF)](http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/general/direct/pr/50155706en.pdf)

&gt;What documentation does the company need to present to the EMEA to support an application for a mock-up vaccine?
 
&gt;The EMEA’s scientific committee, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), looks at data on the methods used to make and test the mock-up vaccine, as well as the results from studies of the vaccine tested in healthy people. This information covers the immunogenicity of the vaccine (its ability to make the immune system, the body’s defence mechanism, produce antibodies against the virus strain), as well as its safety (side effects). The documentation also contains a ‘risk management plan’ that details what will be done to monitor the safe use of the vaccine in a pandemic.  

&gt;What are the next steps? 
&gt;The objective behind a mock-up vaccine is to have a marketing authorisation (licence) in place, which can be changed quickly in the event of a pandemic to include the responsible virus strain, once it has been identified. The mock-up vaccine itself is not expected to be used or stockpiled (stored for use in the future) before the outbreak of a pandemic. 
 
&gt;Once a pandemic has started, the company will first include the pandemic flu strain in the vaccine. It will then apply for a variation (a change to the vaccine’s marketing authorisation) by supplying full information to the CHMP on the vaccine including the new pandemic flu strain. Once the variation has been approved and been granted a marketing authorisation by the European Commission, the vaccine will be available for use. This variation will be processed quickly - normally within a few days - as most of the data on the pandemic flu vaccine will already have been reviewed during the assessment of the mock-up vaccine.

True,1426039585,1252340017,1,"I agree, it's a lot if you look at it with present-time eyes, but back then in the 33-43 many people liked what the Nazist did to drag Germany from hellhole to superpower. Hitler leaved the Danes alone because he liked our white hair and blue eyes and they allowed us to keep our goverment (with Nazist pulling the strings) so Denmark was still Danish runned.

What people think about is supporting their family, not running around in woods shooting at Nazist, but if you take away a mans family you will have a uprising, the Nazists never fought, bombed or made genocide in Denmark. There wasn't really a reason to fight, like in Poland or Eastern Europe.

Denmark is flat and with few trees, unlike Norway which is the ideal place for fighting a guerilla war. 

But people was maybe not in the resistence, but they still resisted, my grandmom once told me how her dad commanded her the day the germans invaded to go inside, get all the silver and gold and bury it in the back yard. My neightbour told me how he was working in the fields when he saw formations of german airplanes flying over his head and how he waved at them and thought it was cool to see airplanes but his dad told him he would whip him if he ever showed respect to a Nazi. The Danish navy sank their ships so the Germans could not use them, the Danish goverment played a lot of tricks with the German supervisors to slow down progress, and many people wore the Star of David to fool the Germans, and in Israel there is some streets, monuments and schools with Danish names in honor for what the Danish fishermen and resistence did to the Jews during WWII. 

The whole Danish resistence was granted Righteous Among the Nations. The same title Oskar Schindler have. 

Hitler had support all over the world, but to say that Denmark did not resist is wrong, there was not much resistence throught violence, but plenty throught disobedience and playing tricks with the Germans, Spielberg was even going to make a movie about the Danish resistence but the boys involvet did want to sell their story to him because Spielberg was going to make changes to the story and the boys now men wanted it to be as accurate as possible. Instead Spielberg made Schindler's List.

Denmark was less touched by the war then other places, therefore less resistence. 

There were 14.000 Danish soldiers, badly equipped, 8000 of them recruits against the might of the German panzer and Blitz tactics and only 11 Danish soldiers died before the surrender, the German loss was close to the same. 

Denmark had a population of 4million, there were 230.000 German soldiers in Denmark, Denmark is a small flat country without many places to hide, any mayor group forming would have been slaughtered in seconds. 

I don't know if you are Danish, but in the school we had a lot about Danish nazists, in the early 1940 mny people thought that Nazisme was going to be the new European system and they could just as well cooperate. Many  people that joined the Nazist was socially weak people and people that got bullied that saw their chance to out of their bad lives and get ""acceptet"" and become something better. Many of them was not bad people, it was weak and sad people that took the chance, I think it's understandable. ",t3_9i0th,c0cvdfk,,True,,,0,reddit.com,False,t5_6,0,t1_c0cvazh,1,t1_c0cvdfk,kasparu,0

True,1426039897,1252359855,9,"&gt;There exists no way for a woman to make a pregnancy disappear without experiencing a financial, medical and emotional burden that is not shared with the man who contributed DNA to the pregnancy.

These are problems specific to the US, and its inhumane way of treating its own citizens. Problems that need addressing, but don't override the principle that *both* parents should have the option of consenting, or not.

You can certainly make the case that the costs of direct consequences of an unintended pregnancy should be shared. But where a person voluntarily chooses to retain an obligation they have the option of relieving themselves of, the other person shouldn't have to also bear the burden.

My example is where an unintended pregnancy occurs and the woman gives birth, and then the father locates a willing adoptive couple. If she can give away the child, then she has no obligation to keep the financial burden of raising it. If she chooses to, then she must accept responsibility for that choice.

&gt;Additionally, there exists no way for a woman to absolve herself of the pregnancy without abortion; under this proposal, a man could sign away his responsibilities while knowing that the child will be born anyway and will survive without his input or involvement. 

That would be *her* choice to do so or not. Abortion is a very real option, it being unpleasant doesn't detract from that.

&gt;This is basically a ""Male Irresponsibility Encouragement Proposal,"" which reinforces social stigmas against the importance of fatherhood.

I think this is the same level of argument as ""we can't give welfare to black women, they'll just keep having fatherless babies!""

If a woman chooses to have a child alone, whether by sperm donor, adoption, or anonymous one-night sex, that's *her* option. In two of those cases, the biological father bears no obligation. My and other men's argument is that in the third case, if the father denies consent to become a parent, the situation should be the same.

&gt;Couples should discuss pregnancy before sex. If men having sex without consenting to the potential of fatherhood is causing men problems, advocate for education that informs men that sex may result in fatherhood, and encourages them to turn down sex if they disagree with their partner's opinions on accidental pregnancy.

I have *absolutely* no disagreement with this. Sex education and birth control advocacy should be much better in the US.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_pregnancy#Global_incidence

Western Europe is seen as more ""sexually liberal"" than the US, yet enjoys a much lower rate of teen pregnancy **and** abortion. Sorry, your country is fucked up. :)

&gt;Consensual sex involves the tacit agreement (and preferably the explicit agreement) between two people that they will engage in an activity that carries some risk of pregnancy.
That's true. It's also tacit consent to possibly contract an STD: there's no test for HPV in men, and AIDS isn't always detected. That doesn't mean that the partner  has to be happy about having contracted the disease.

Sex isn't consent to pregnancy. That principle underlies much of the pro-choice movement's position. The same should apply to men. 

&gt;You're using the A = B/ B = C thing again here.

I'm sorry Saydrah, but this is the third time you've used this construction, and I don't believe it applies to any of them. If you want to describe how my argument fails in modal logic, please be my guest. But I am drawing comparisons that are not merely rhetorical. If there's a flaw in my reasoning, you'll need to be specific.

&gt;I stated that suffering should not be inflicted on a child, stacking the deck against it from birth, because the father feels like abdicating his responsibilities to his child. 

This is an example of arguing from maternalism, as I described above.

If a woman carries an unintended child to term, and keeps the child when she has the option of placing it with an adoptive family, then she has made both the choice to allow that child to exist (it didn't have to) and retain the burden of carrying for it (she doesn't have to). The responsibility to provide for it must then lie with her.

There should *be* no responsibility to a child a man never consented to be the father of.

Again, if there exist children suffering financially, and society as a whole has a problem with that, then society as a whole should address it, rather than compelling men to finance women's voluntary choices.

&gt;What about the pragmatic, real-world choice to have sex, knowing it might create a baby? If a man made that choice, he can be expected to step up financially, to a reasonable degree.
""If a woman made that choice, she can be expected to step up and bear the child.""

It's the same thing. Women do not have to keep an unintended child. Men have the right to the same degree choice.

&gt;The father and mother both had a right to decline to participate in the activity that led to the birth of this child.
Again trying to equate sex with consent to parenthood. ""You play, you pay"", again, from the Christian fundamentalist handbook. And in actuality, making all women to be prostitutes. You have sex, you pay afterwards if she [lies about the birth control](http://forum.freeadvice.com/child-custody-visitation-37/ex-lied-about-taking-birth-control-65569.html) or [sabotaged](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control_sabotage) it. She wants a baby, and can force a man to pay for her lifestyle decision *merely by seducing him into sex*.

Doesn't that seem something like financial rape?

Actually, I'm glad I raised that point. Feminists, and here rightly I think, assert that a woman *has the right to withdraw consent to sex at any point*. Even if the man is nearing climax, she has the right to tell him to stop and get off. If he does not, he's committing sexual assault.
The corollary is that *men have the right to withdraw consent to the effects of sex*. Just because a man had an orgasm in a willing woman (something I think you'll agree men are powerfully driven to do, and women don't have much trouble finding men who will do it), doesn't mean he shouldn't be able to say no to becoming a father, even if the woman wants to ""continue the process"".
&gt;I disagree with the implication that abortion is preferable to single parenthood.
That's your belief perhaps, but should have no bearing on the legal framework for our society. Abortion exists as an option. NOT having one, as from my example above, is actively choosing not to turn away from driving into the wall. Choosing to do so then means the burden rests on the person who decided to keep going.

&gt;I don't think the right to be an irresponsible parent is more important than a child's right to exist without poverty.

Is the sperm donor an ""irresponsible parent""? A man who's consenting to sex, and only sex, shouldn't be viewed as much different. If a pregnancy occurs, he should have the *choice* to walk away, or assert his parental rights and obligations. Just like the woman can.
&gt;But without that safety net in place, intelligent child support reform is needed, but there is not a sufficient argument for paternal abdication.

Protecting a man's right to choose could help spur that reform, and improvements to welfare.

Actually, given the insane debate around healthcare in your country, I wouldn't be optimistic. :(

However, this discussion *doesn't only apply to the USA*, and it's ethnocentric to assume that the US is the only country that matters. This is a human rights issue, that needs to be brought up around the world.  Men should have the right to say ""no"" to parenthood, just as a woman does.

Freenet is a great network for censorship-resistant filesharing and data storage, but the freesite aspect isn't terribly great. Freenet is very, very powerful in terms of censorship-resistance. Once inserted, files will not be removed until they have been completely unused for a matter of years, and through the network, it's impossible to do something like a DoS to remove access to a file.

If you're into that sort of anonymity network (filesharing, censorship-resistance) I recommend taking a look at [GNUnet](https://gnunet.org). Like Freenet, it can do P2P and F2F filesharing, and supports the same sort of content migration that Freenet does. Unlike freenet, it has a modular transport layer, so you can communicate over TCP, UDP, SMTP (yes, you read that right) and HTTP by default. Transports for 802.11 and maybe more firewall-dodging things like DNS and ICMP are coming soon.

Everyone should also check out [Tor](https://torproject.org) and [I2P](http://i2p2.de), primarily outproxy and inproxy networks respectively. That means you can use Tor to anonymously go to, say, Reddit, but you could use I2P to host a version of Reddit anonymously (note the people going to that would still be anonymous).

There is only freedom of speech if there is freedom of anonymous speech. The founders of the United States knew this, which is why they published their pamphlets anonymously -- protecting them from the British Crown and helping to establish a democratic government. The current leaders in government in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, the People's Republic of China, and almost every other government in the world know this -- this is why they have been using fearmongering and scapegoats (like terrorism, drug dealing, and child porn) to steadily and stealthily limit anonymity and hence, freedom of speech, on the internet.

**Don't** let our generation be the last to experience the wonder that is free speech on the internet. **Don't** let power-hungry and $$-eyed politicos and corporations strip away **your** rights, and your children's rights, for the sake of their wallets. Privacy-enhancing technologies have the power to take your rights back and keep them yours, at least for now.

There is ample proof that Gandhi said and did some extremely racist things. So to say that he was racist against blacks is the truth. Maybe he changed later in life – but you have not given any evidence of that. 

&gt; affir comes from kafir, which is an arabic term for those who don't follow islam [or perhaps those who are jewish/christian only, w/e] and so in this context it makes no sense at all, it's not even a bad word -- it didn't even describe blacks!""

The word is a lot more offensive than the word Nigger. We can discuss this verbatim but the fact remains that it is. Maybe it is not just the root with the word – but the negative stereotype associated with the word “kaffir” is far worse than the American word “nigger”.

(Many “Indians” in South Africa were Muslim btw.)

&gt; what newspaper (that too, incorrectly).

AFAIK, the name of the newspaper changed. This may make sense since the structure of the government changed (South Africa only came to existence after 1900. Before that it was separate colonies/republics). I am not 100% sure of this but you should look it up.

&gt; The quotes appeared in letters to some medical officer, and also in the Indian opinion.

Yes. And one of those quotes comes from a public speech he made in Bombay. But I don’t know what the purpose of this comment of yours is. The fact of the matter is that he made racist remarks and it is properly sourced.

&gt; Are you really telling me this? Have you lost your mind? Do you not think that a man like MLK would perchance spend some time to get to know what sort of person he is modeling some of his efforts off of?

Maybe, maybe not. We today have the hindsight of half a century of research and the internet. I doubt that MLK subscribed to the Indian Opinion. AFAIK, they did not deliver to the USA.

&gt; If Gandhi sincerely held a belief that blacks were inferior to Indians/others all his life, he would've put that in writing.

Uhm… He did put it in writing in the Indian Opinion!

&gt; Not once did he say anything of the sort after he left SA for India.

Gandhi made the following statement in a public speech in Bombay:

&gt; Ours is one continual struggle against a degradation sought to be inflicted upon us by the Europeans, who desire to degrade us to the level of the raw Kaffir whose occupation is hunting, and whose sole ambition is to collect a certain number of cattle to buy a wife with and, then, pass his life in indolence and nakedness.

&gt; is early remarks are not kind, and certainly can be construed as racist.

His early remarks cannot be “construed” as racist, they were racist. 

&gt; nderdeveloped opinions on Gandhi and yet you seem so damn confident.

I have a high regard for Gandhi. But that does not mean that I am going to ignore his small imperfections (which are negligible when compared to the rest of his life) and raise him to the level of a saint. He was only human after all (with human characteristics). 

&gt; you want to go in this no holds barred one-way blasting on gandhi.

No. I am just illuminating a lot of people here on this thread that they have a one dimensional view of Gandhi. 

&gt; i'm just contending that he is a complex man,

That is what I also argue. 

&gt; and that we cannot label him a racist.

He was a racist (that is a fact). But how many other people were also racist? 

What do you remember Hendry Ford for? He was racist yet he did amazingly good work. The same for many other people. People are not just these saints that did everything good. Wernher von Braun used Jewish Slave labour but without his Saturn rockets the moonlanding would not have happened. James Watson helped figure out the helix structure for DNA but he thinks black people are stupid. Most of the founding fathers also held a low opinion of black people.

Well I would if there was actually a point in doing that. Your statement only proves my point: that it's impossible to judge who can properly claim the land. In this case as in many others throughout history, might makes right. The dominant nation/tribe wipes out the other one and life and history moves on. It's not pretty but it is the reality of the situation. Israel has no wish to share the land, so they're quietly encroaching on Palestinian territory bit by bit, year by year. The only reason they haven't completely wiped out the Palestinians already is because doing so would raise an international uproar. By working slowly and steadily, they can achieve their goal without drawing too much attention to the slowly-worsening situation. The international community is good at reacting to large, short-term crises - but terrible at solving slow, long-term problems (think global warming).

Where the hell did you get that from?

I said I don't trust authority. honestly I don't know much about economics, but I know political philosophy. It seems to me that capitalism is practically unsustainable. It creates a group of people, and it tends to be small, who control a massive amount of world resources. Those people cannot help, by virtue of human nature, but to persue an agenda that benefits them at the expense of their social inferiors. Government, being comprised only of mere humans, cannot help but be corrupted by the money and influence of the capitalist over-class. I think regulation can be good and my proof is the resilience of the European economy, and their high quality of life. 

I like freedom, but I recognize it has limist. It is not the only virtue. It must, in society, be balanced against equality and fraternity. You seem to equate freedom with personal property rights and therefore ordaining capitalism. Is there no right higher than than the right to property? What about the right to life? 

&gt;Do I prefer everyone being comfortable and entitled to use violence. People can use violence now, but they have to answer for it. Government typically does not. This is why you hear about all those shooting sprees at gun shows!

I am not sure I disagree with you. Do you think all government is unnecessary? I think if some government is necessary (roads and bridges at the least) it must collect taxes, or else fund itself some other way. Would it not then need some mechanism of funding? Would it not then need some means of enforcement?

When it comes to the drug war in America, I think we could do without much of the power the police have now, but do they serve no benefit? Why wouldn't eliminating the police produce a lawless ""wild west"" type society?

&gt; The rich and powerful will always have power by definition. The trick is to make sure they compete with each other as much as possible toward the betterment of society.

This never worked. The country that allows for the wildest competition turns out to be the one with the most abuse from the riches and the most sold out state out of the rich countries. Even within Europe, this is visible: the more economically liberal countries are slightly more sold out to the rich class.

&gt; In a system where one group of the rich can gather an unassailable stranglehold on the voting process they will no longer need to compete and will simply focus on maintaining their own power base at the expense of everyone else.

Thirds are only under the direct control of the state. And of course, a limit on wealth will also affect the appraised of all of their private goods, which are easy to track because all they can own is:

True,1426040767,1252437067,1,"I don't know all the foreign policy rationale behind that.  The US currently gives Israel $3B in military aid per year.  It's not truly massive compared to the total budget of Israel or the US, though it is a significant chunk of cash, and it is by far the largest amount of foreign aid given any nation by the US.

I can guess at a few points; at one point in time, Israel was strategically useful as an advance point against the Soviet Union.  (Today, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the existence of US military bases in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, access to Turkey, and so forth would seem to me to greatly reduce this value.)

There is a certain amount of political support that Israel gets in the US, both from concern over the Holocaust and wanting to help set things right and the fact that most people in the United States grow up in a Christian environment.  The first half of the Christian religious book essentially amounts to a quite nationalist set of writings belonging to the ancient kingdom of Israel.  The typical stuff for a country of the time -- divine support for its rulers, its enemies will be crushed, its people are favored by patron gods, etc, etc, but many US residents are still brought up with it as the direct word of the creator of the universe.  [Chick tracts](http://www.chick.com/reading/tracts/1055/1055_01.asp?wpc=1055_01.asp&amp;wpp=a) form an extreme example.  That leads to things like [CUFI](http://www.cufi.org/site/PageServer) as well as a general degree of political support:

&gt;The Bible commands us to pray for the peace of Jerusalem (Psalm 122:6), to speak out for Zion’s sake (Isaiah 62:1), to be watchmen on the walls of Jerusalem (Isaiah 62:6) and to bless the Jewish people (Genesis 12:3). These and so many other verses of the Bible that have one overriding message-- as Christians we have a Biblical obligation to defend Israel and the Jewish people in their time of need.

Early Zionists aimed for influencing officials (and particularly Jewish officials) in the United States to gain support; the US was influential, didn't have nearly the same negative feelings about Jews that much of the West did, didn't have some political ties to the Arabs that the UK did, etc.  Israel today still takes a similar approach.  It tries to encourage Jewish US citizens to live in Israel for some time to build up bonds and then support Israel in the future.  It has a well-organized and effective lobby; you may notice the 2008 US Presidential candidates going to great lengths at AIPAC speeches to make assurances of a continued special relationship with Israel.  It's not typical for any other foreign country to receive such guarantees during candidacy.  Palestine, having little money and few people with family ties in the US, doesn't have nearly the same resources.  Jewish Israelis (particularly those from a European background) have many more cultural commonalities with US residents than do Palestinians.

None of these points stand alone, but they'd all be factors that would help Israel obtain more support than would Palestine.",t3_9i34k,c0cwrg1,,False,,,0,worldnews,False,t5_2qh13,0,t1_c0cwgk4,1,t1_c0cwrg1,zubzub2,0

Equality and fraternity? what? why is that important? Can you really establish fraternity through force? You cannot establish equality at all? People are different.

Life is fine. life is great! but why and how should peoples' lives come in conflict with rights to property? If their life somehow supersedes property rights, then what's the good in having them?, and what's the good in trying to accumulate property/wealth when it can be appropriated at will?

Why WOULD eliminating police produce a ""wild west"" type of society? (the 'wild' west was not as violent as 1950's hollywood would have you believe, most of the problems took place in urban areas). Are people so violent where you are?

Roads and bridges? Would you throw someone in jail or shoot them because they did not pay for a road or bridge they will never use?

While you would be correct in saying that there is a majority view that Fascism is a right wing ideology, it is very wrong to present this as an indisputable fact.

True,1426041404,1252512061,7,"They say that -- but I don't think that's the real reason.  I'm French and in France (as you may have heard) they've used the concept of laicity -- strict separation of church and state -- to argue that French muslim women shouldn't be allowed to wear a headscarf in school.  The law also bans yarmulkes and ""excessively large crosses"" but as you can imagine neither of those is particularly common.

Anyway, the impetus for the law was supposedly because young French Muslim girls were being forced by their fathers and brothers to wear the hijab, which went against French principles of egalitarianism between the sexes.  I'm sure you'd agree that in cases when that actually happens it's unacceptable, but the truth is that, particularly in France, the older generation is typically far less likely to wear a headscarf than the younger generation, who see it as a statement of identity.  So the idea that Arab fathers are forcing their young daughters to wear headscarves in droves is silly.

I think the real reason there's so much opposition to it, particularly in Europe (I'm including the UK here) is because the headscarf is a very visible symbol of cultural change.  French people are deeply concerned about preserving their cultural heritage, and they worry about immigrants changing it.  You hear it again and again: ""I don't mind them coming to France, but if they're going to live here they must act French.""  That means white and Christian, in case you couldn't figure it out.

I live in the US now and here things are much better, because the US is a nation of immigrants and it's difficult to support the notion that any one group's culture is more important than another's -- of course that doesn't stop the anglo fundies from trying to make English the official language or Christianity the official religion or whatever -- but basically when it comes straight down to it you can cut anyone who tries that angle down by asking them if they're a Native American or not.

Obviously that same angle doesn't work as well in a place like France or the UK, where you have a thousand years of Western European cultural dominance to contend with.

Anyway, I just thought I'd share my own perception about this: I really think trying to make it about women's rights is a red herring.  It's really about them trying to banish conspicuously foreign symbols from view.",t3_9ik8r,c0cxwsn,,True,,,0,IAmA,False,t5_2qzb6,0,t1_c0cxr5v,7,t1_c0cxwsn,808140,0

True,1426041439,1252515651,1,"&gt; The problem with this is using the Irish population as a tool in order to further an agenda of anti-european unionism. 

It's not in our interests - or in the interest of the people of Europe in general - to promote an undemocratic European polity.  I'm not anti-EU, I think it's great, but the Lisbon Treaty has been rejected whereever it has been run and it is bad for all Europeans if the political stratus can fly so independently from its constituents.  This is a firm point.  It has been rejected, politicians must listen to their electorate.

&gt; These scare tactics are brought in every time by the euroskeptics.

What about the scare tactics from the Yes side?  It's all ""if we don't say yes then (economic doom/heart of europe/people won't like us/...)"". Where is the positive canvassing? 

&gt; the majority of the lobbyists for voting against the treaty are not Irish

You miss my point - I mean industrial lobbyists.  Take Ireland for Europe's Director, Pat Cox, ex-president of the European Parliament: he works for a giant lobbyist group who represent Intel, Novartis, Coca-Cola, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries, and he directly represents Pfizer and Microsoft.

&gt; Voting No again will not force 'proper debate' across the union.

I fear you are right here, and this is surely cautionary.  When France rejected the Constitution, Jack Straw warned that this raised ""profound questions"" about the direction of Europe.  Jack Straw's government promised a referendum on Lisbon prior to the last UK General Election and it has since broken that promise. Politicians in Ireland and the Netherlands said they would ""respect the result"" of the referendums in each country, and in each case this was not done.

The Lisbon Treaty itself - and the constitution before it - has demonstrated that EU decision-makers do not respect the electorate, and _that_ is the problem. This democratic deficiency is an issue in itself, an issue much greater than the Lisbon Treaty, one that should have been tackled after the Constitution was rejected, but which instead was ignored.  Voting No is the only possible way to disrupt the direction of this anti-democratic movement.  And I say this for all of Europe, not just for Ireland.",t3_9irpm,c0cxzjg,,True,,,0,ireland,False,t5_2qhb9,0,t1_c0cxw8l,1,t1_c0cxzjg,bokononon,0

Im from scandinavia but have lived in Prague for 3 years. I absolutely love the city but the salary is so much lower so any trips home would just be to expensive. I rather earn more and go to Prague.

First when you land on the airport. Buy a busticket in the actual airport building. Walk past the taxis and go to the next aisle and take the bus. You will have to change to the metro (Dejvicka) but it is the bus' endstation so it is impossible to miss. Then exit at Mustek. That just saved you 250 Czk. Then jump on the tramvaj line 9. Continue past the central station and you are now in Zizkov. 

Here you have a bunch of cheap hostels and good pubs. Settle in and walk down Cimburkova to tiky taky bar and have a beer. 

If you like smoking weed, you will find it in most places in Zizkov. Just be friendly and ask anyone smoking and you will find some good stuff. It is basically legal.

There is a lot to see and do and any guide book will tell you. What I like most is to walk late at night and watch the beatiful city. Avoid the vaclav square at night it is just filled up with prostitutes and brits on stag parties. Avoid any eating or drinking in the old town, its just expensive and bad.

Give in to your carnal appetite and eat czech food. It is fat but quite good. When you are sick of it there are (for some reason) tons of good italian places.

I'm from scandinavia so the distances down there are very small. You can basically go prague - Vienna - Budapest - Bratislava - Prague in 2 days if you rent a car (which is quite cheap if you look around). I prefer going by bus and train though.

A really nice place in CR is Ceske Krumlov. It is as medieval as it can get (even in CR). If you have seen Hostel, the actual hostel part is filmed there (not Slovakia). From there it is close to Vienna. I haven't been there much and was not impressed but other people I know like it.

Budapest is a must, good wine and food. I recommend going to a local spa where hungarians go.
Bratislava is close from here as well. Much like Prague but a lot smaller.

It is quite close to Croatia from here. Many Czech take the bus, it takes some time but is very cheap. The coast in croatia is extremely beatiful and Split and Dubrovnik is very nice. I rented a car and took it from Dubrovnik to Split and drove inland through Bosnia past Mostar. Again not very far.

Interesting day trips from Prague is:
Kutná Hora - with the skeleton furnished church
Karlovy Vary - a spa place. A bit boring after some time but worth a trip if you stay for some time.

Krakow is nice but it takes some time to get there. To see Auschwitz is extremely depressing but worth it just to see how sick Europe was just some decades ago.

Berlin is definitely worth a visit. Trains from Prague that go extremely slow.

If you have a netbook, bring it. Many pubs and cafes has wifi. 

Some mention crime. As I said I have lived there for 3 years and nohing ever happend. I would say that the crime rate is extremely low. I have walked around late alone and completely drunk (which easily happens when the a good pint costs $2), and nothing ever happened. I try not to be an asshole and I think that is the trick.

Typical scams are money changing on the street that is always a scam. In the early 90's you got a better rate but today it is no point.
Some taxis try to scam you as well. Make them put on the meter and use common sense. Anything above 150 Czk within the center is usually a ripoff. Remember to always pay when you use the metro, they usually check all tourists, if you go with the tram they check less often.

I don't know your budget but food and beer is cheap. Accomodation (hotels) are expensive but hostels are ok. Transport is cheap but not very fast. Going by long distances buses is by far the cheapest.

Some interesting things:
They have this german influence of music. They have discos where they actually play Modern Talking nowadays. It is very exotic. It is this place close to Lucerna where they have (had?) a huge disco and played 80's music and showed the videos and a huge screen. Im a bit older than you so for me it was great, drinking beer and watching Alphaville videos.
In Prague they have old school malls. It is called Pasaz which was built pre WW2 and is absolutely beatiful. There is one (again Lucerna) where there is a dead huge horse hanging upside down. I first saw it being completely pissed. When I woke up the next day I thought I was hallucinating. You can actually walk a lot around in the center in these Pasazes.

Don't be american and accept that Europe is big. Not area wise but there are so many people (and therefore places) so a 3 week trip around the whole place is just to short time.

Movies are usually not dubbed. Watch for the word titulky.

Every American I have met has been incredibly polite, although I wouldn't say that politeness was really a stereotype the world holds of America.

However, despite on paper having possibly the best system of government, with your constitution to control government power, it really doesn't seem to be all that effective, and I have to say that your current political situation seems ridiculous from the outside. I would say that was common consensus.

The American government, no matter who is in charge appears to be the bully of the world. A step out of line, no matter who, and America is trying to force the perpetrator to conform to its standards, despite the country not being under any form of American jurisdiction. Really the opposite of what the founders wanted.

Take the recent Megrahi incident. The Scottish government released him on compassionate grounds due to his terminal ill health (part of Scots law, no special exemption made for him). Due to this, there seemed to be an overwhelming level of American outrage, Obama spoke out against it and boycotts of Scottish and possibly British produce were suggested.

Even as an ally who has been America's lapdog for years, providing troops for America's wars, etc, as soon as a foot was put of place, America clamped down, showing that it doesn't really care about Britain.

I think most people realise that American politicians and the American media do not accurately give a representation of the American people.

I think a common stereotype that is held by many in Britain is: ""Democrats=sane, normal people like us, Republicans=the crazy half of America"".

Not a sereotype that I agree with however.

Marshall today is best remembered primarily for the Marshall Plan -- American aid to help rebuild post WW2 Europe.   But during WW2 he was Ike's, MacArthur, and all other American Generals Boss.    

He out-ranked all other American military personal.  Heck, the reason an American 5-star General is called ""General of the Army"" and not ""Field Marshal"" like most other military's around the world  is because Marshall's last name was Marshall.    People thought Field Marshal Marshall would sound a little stupid.  

Anyway, in the post-war Truman Administration Marshall severed as both Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense.  He was one of the primary architects of the policy of Soviet containment.   Truman was a Democrat.  

Republican Senator ""Tail Gunner"" Joe McCarthy was then making a name for himself by ferreting out Communists, real and imagined.   One of the people McCarthy named as a Communist was George Marshall.  

In 1952, during the Presidential Campaign, Eisenhower was going to make an appearance at a political rally in Wisconsin, the state that elected McCarthy to the Senate.   Ike had planned to denounce McCarthy for making shit up about Marshall.   This was the day when politics was not supposed to be personal... and besides, when it came to foreign policy, there was not much difference then befween Dems and Repubs.    

Well, long story short, Ike chickened at the very last minute and did not defend Marshall or condemn McCarthy.    Therefore it took several more years before McCarthy was forced to shut-the-fuck up and get busy drinking himself to death.  There is evidence that Eisenhower helped in the back-room maneuvering that got McCarthy censured.  But that was in private.  Ike never said anything in public because he was worried that a few idiots might think he was soft on communism.   Eisenhower didn't defend a friend in need who was clearly in the right.  He was worried about how it might adversely affect him.    And the worst part.... it wouldn't have adversely affected Ike at all.  It would have ended the political cancer that was McCarthy years earlier.

True,1426041859,1252554000,1,"Thanks for an incredibly honest reply that didn't sound like a wounded puppy.

Is it worth it?  Who knows?  To be honest, I feel like those old European morality plays - Every man goes to his grave alone.  If all relationships are people using people, why not take what people take to be friendships and use them to my advantage in order to curry favors and raise my pay grade with their work?

I have a few friends separate from this game, but I must admit I often think of how people can help me.  I expect the same from everyone else.  I understand how people might think of me as crazy or sad, but I think of them as numbers.  Meanwhile, I have a nice house and several vacation weeks per year based on what I consider to be my propensity to use people.  I am rather happy and think that the game I'm in is a shame, but I'm playing to enjoy the creature comforts available.

Your reply reminds me of an old story whose merits I think are implicit:

A man goes on vacation in a tropical paradise.  He finds a fisherman relaxing by his pole.

Man:  What are you doing?

Fisherman:  Fishing.

Man:  Why?  Don't you want to earn money?

Fisherman:  I enjoy this, and it supports my family alright.

Man:  Don't you want to make a fortune?

Fisherman:  Why?

Man:  So that you can build a home for yourself on an island like this.

Fisherman:  Why?

Man:  So that you can spend your time doing what you want.

Fisherman:  I do that already.  ...Why should I buy into your system again?

...So, I get that.  Maybe I'm playing a sucker's game, but I'm playing it well.  Meanwhile, I have ""friends"" who are introverted engineers who help with projects I need.

Is this shockingly materialistic?  Sure.  Perhaps I should be ashamed, but I don't think ""civilization"" has moved as far beyond the Gothic hordes as people want to believe.

And yes, I see that they ""see me coming from miles away.""  I'd say that they see my contemporaries coming.  My ability to seem genuine is responsible in part for my promotions.  I'd propose they don't see me coming, and have ""friends"" lying in wait to use them.  Or, perhaps, they happily live in a sociopath-free environment -- but if the rate of 1 in 25 Americans as sociopaths is to be believed, that seems unlikely.

Perhaps the implicit assumption is that shy people are implicitly uninteresting, and that people only use them to achieve their own goals.  This seems to fit very well with the claim that ""Engineers make up 5% of the population and make up 50% of the wealth.""  Perhaps if people took them seriously or wanted to engage in business with them, engineers would do better for themselves.

For example, they have imitated much of the reforms that had made it possible for Dubai to grow economically as Doha resembles a construction site and politically it tries to act as an intermediary between different groups. The Qatari emir is open to Israeli diplomatic relations, while this is obviously a simple step for the west, over here in the Middle East that is a very big issue.

&gt;Al Arabiya is partly owned by the Saudis 

Yes, the MBC group which is pretty popular in terms of their entire group of channels. Al Arabiya treads a fine line between being investigative while seeking not to anger the Saudi's. However they do not completely gloss over news the way Jazeera does with interests they seek not to anger. For example, it will speak about Saudi's being trained to fight in Iraq, but won't mention government involvement however it will allow guests to mention that. 

Here is an Op-Ed written by Al Arabiya's General Manager after the Beslan High School massacre.

[It is a certain fact that not all Muslims are terrorists, but it is equally certain, and exceptionally painful, that almost all terrorists are Muslims.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/1471043/Innocent-religion-is-now-a-message-of-hate.html)

I believe that the above article set and altered the tone of Al Arabiya from 2004 to this day. While yes, Arab nationalism and Islamic militancy has a huge crowd in the Middle East, Al Jazeera can not simply operate on those terms and while Al Arabiya focused on being more neutral and excelled it took too long for Jazeera to do so. 

This is why Al Arabiya has surpassed Jazeera in terms of viewership over here in the Middle East




[Audience figures for March 2006 for Saudi Arabia, the Middle East's largest commercial market where approximately 70 percent of its advertising dollars are spent, show Al Arabiya with a 27.3 rating, opening a gap almost double the audience for Al Jazeera, which has a 16.7 rating. Only a year ago, in March 2005, Al Jazeera held an almost 10 point audience rating lead over Al Arabiya (29.5 percent to 20 percent), which went on the air only three years ago.](http://www.mafhoum.com/press9/275C36.htm)


And





[Al Arabiya's content is seen by IPSOS-STAT as more moderate and seemingly more in tune with what viewers want to watch, and Al Arabiya's management is given credit for being ""more enlightened and visionary.""](http://uscpublicdiplomacy.com/index.php/newsroom/worldcast_detail/060119_al_jazeeras_middle_east_popularity_wanes_as_its_north_american_sib/)

The only time I've been hit by one was a few years ago coming out of the tube (they had those **ludicrous** signs saying ""watch for pickpockets"" -- so of course everyone patted their wallets to make sure they were still there...guess what...) and although I am 90% sure I know which guy it was who bumped into me (rush hour), the dude was so good that he managed to get my deeply buried wallet without me having any clue.  

I actually work in security, currently as a risk analyst, and a significant amount of our work consists of premises security.  CCTV is part of a whole suite of tools for deterring and analyzing stuff after the fact, if implemented correctly.  Reliable and secure data storage, correct privilege implementation to make sure unauthorized people can't get at any personal identifying info, consistent review and action procedures are all part of this, but it's rare that you run across a CCTV install that's more than a checkmark on someone's audit list, or the result of an uninformed ""heyyy, if we put up cameras, bad...uh...things will...uh...happen less!  Yeah!"" decision.  

In crime prevention / investigation, they are no replacement for decent policing, horribly prone to misuse, and while admittedly an occasional contributory factor to a (very) occasional arrest, there's a whole slew of other elements that need to be in place for this to happen.  They are a visible feel-good measure, which I tend to lump under what Bruce Schneier calls ""security circus"" -- do stuff, in this case implement technical measures, that is visible and gives people the feeling that ""something is being done.""

That, in combination with frequent poor accountability on those charged with surveillance, worries me.

Note that I am only singling out the UK here for being among the worst as far as the density of CCTV and the piss-poor transparency of information collection and use policies are concerned.  They are by no means the only offender; the fact that there is such a thing as a DPA (even though many people don't have much clue about how to go about enforcing their rights under it) is already a big step.  

There are very few European governments who do not have similar problems, and those that do are usually either too clueless or too preoccupied with other issues to bother...

Goats are one of the oldest domesticated species. For thousands of years, goats have been used for their milk, meat, hair, and skins over much of the world. In the twentieth century they also gained in popularity as pets.

Female goats are referred to as does or nannies, intact males as bucks or billies; their offspring are kids. Castrated males are wethers.

Lets be bloody clear on this, other EU countries have used there elected representatives to vote on the treaty. That is the nature of democracy. You don't have referendums on everything otherwise why would you elect politicians in the first place. 

If you think Ireland is such a great democracy asking us to vote on Lisbon then why is there no referendum on NAMA, or why is Brian Cowen still our Prime Minister when obviously only 15% of the population want him there. In my opinion we are making fools of ourselves at the moment, the treaty has nothing to do with the minimum wage, abortion, fishing etc. and yet that is what most people are worried about. It seems that Irish people are extremely stupid and lazy because they educate themselves on the treaty by reading lies on posters on telegraph poles rather than reading any information on the treaty. What signal are we sending out to the world and to potential investors. The treaty is a written document every coir lie has been proven to be incorrect and yet is still believed by the fools in the country.

By the way there is nothing special about our constitution it is basically a copy of other countries. Many Irish judges consider that the ruling that we require a referendum on the Lisbon treaty was incorrect as it does not affect our constitution. 

My final point is that the Lisbon treaty was not rejected by French voters the European Constitution was. The pieces of the proposed European constitution which affected there own constitution were removed so that it could be passed by their parliament.

That was the long-term plan, but Soviet forces in 1941 were in a terrible state and Germany was still absolutely undefeated. The Soviet army had just a year earlier been humiliated in the Winter War and they were still suffering from lack of competent officers due to Stalin's purges. Attempting an offensive war against Germany in 1941/2 would have been outright suicidal.",t3_9jaf6,c0czuof,,True,,,0,history,False,t5_2qh53,0,t3_9jaf6,3,t1_c0czuof,Atomics,0

You're right GST is touchy and 5% is acceptable if they find other ways of getting the money. What I really want is a carbon tax system. There is mounting evidence that it is a form of progressive tax as the wealthy use more carbon then the poor. The issue is whether the wealthy will pass the costs on to the consumers. I personally can't see it happening in a greater way then introducing a percentage tax on the wealthy. I am an accounting student and have read plenty of the tax act and the more you read it the more you realize there are mechanisms in there for manipulating society to be a better place. A Carbon tax is just a further extension of what already exists. As of current with our tax system the wealthy don't pass on savings or further costs from credits or additional taxes. You are bang on about trusts through and I don't support the Liberal policy of reversing that decision. 

Basically I have an issue with the GST cut because of the timing. We saw a recession coming and he gave Canada a tax cut which is not a very efficient thing to do. In a lot of ways our high tax rates do bring balance to our economy and there is empirical evidence to support that.

He didn't act quick enough and our turnaround is much slower then it should have been. Of course it is difficult to say exactly how things would have gone if he would have acted differently but I and some of my economist friends agree that it wasn't quick enough. In fact, I didn't have much of an issue with Harper until this event due to his arrogance of the whole situation. For months he stated that Canada would not go into a recession which was unbelievable since all the primary indicators obviously stated the opposite.

In many countries in Europe coalitions are formed in their parliaments to create majority government. They form coalitions to be able to pass legislation for the greater good by balancing out the extremism in the coalitions. In some of the countries is is very possible for a green party like group could have a coalition with a centrist group to pass legislation that both of them agree on. It is in fact true democracy because you have smaller parties representing certain demographics that support certain policies.

For instance I don't really have a party in the Canadian government that represents all of my views but the closest common denominator is the liberal party. If there were a party that was more in line with my interests I would vote for them and I would expect them to form coalitions to pass legislation in my interest. This is why I think in part our system is broke. We are stuck in the middle of American type system with 2 large parties and the European style of many small parties. we need to go either way and I doubt the Conservative party is going to break up so I think the NDP needs to be disbanded and assimilated into the Liberal party.

It is not as simple as that. Poland wanted access to the sea - so a lot of German territory was expropriated to make that happen (including creating the Free city of Danzig). So it was not as clear cut as that - there were other motives at play.

&gt; ""Well, its not as if we're that great"" whenever they see atrocities committed?

For interest sake, the Holocaust only became publically known **after** WW2. This was while Britain was oppressing people in its colonies. 

The WW2 actually gave a lot of people in these colonies hope that Britain would be defeated and that they would gain their independence. It is at least partially a result of WW2 that Britain ceased to be a world superpower and that its colonies gained its independence earlier.

True,1426042875,1252675923,27,"&gt; I live in a country that was peddled like mere change to Stalin at the Yalta conference, followed by years of terror under a brutal occupation. I'm pretty sure my grandparents would have heartily welcomed British or US troops in 1945.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalta_Conference#The_conference

&gt; The conference
&gt;
&gt;All three leaders were trying to establish an agenda for governing post-war Germany. Churchill's Soviet policy differed vastly from that of Roosevelt, with the former believing Stalin to be a ""devil""-like tyrant leading a vile system. In 1943, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union William Christian Bullitt, Jr.'s thesis prophesied the ""flow of the Red amoeba into Europe"". Roosevelt responded to Bullitt, Jr. with a statement summarizing his rationale for war time relations with Stalin:
&gt;
&gt;“I just have a hunch that Stalin is not that kind of a man. . . . I think that if I give him everything I possibly can and ask for nothing from him in return, noblesse oblige, he won't try to annex anything and will work with me for a world of democracy and peace.	”
&gt;
&gt; —Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1943

...

&gt; Poland was the first item on the Soviet agenda. Stalin stated that ""[f]or the Soviet government, the question of Poland was one of honor"" and security because Poland had served as a historical corridor for forces attempting to invade Russia. In addition, Stalin stated regarding history that ""because the Russians had greatly sinned against Poland"", ""the Soviet government was trying to atone for those sins."" Stalin concluded that ""Poland must be strong"" and that ""the Soviet Union is interested in the creation of a mighty, free and independent Poland."" Accordingly, Stalin stipulated that Polish government-in-exile demands were not negotiable: the Soviet Union would keep the territory of eastern Poland they had already annexed in 1939, and Poland was to be compensated for that by extending its Western borders at the expense of Germany. Comporting with his prior statement, Stalin promised free elections in Poland despite the Communist puppet government recently installed by him in Polish territories occupied by the Red Army.
&gt;
&gt; Roosevelt wanted the USSR to enter the Pacific War with the Allies. One Soviet precondition for a declaration of war against Japan was an American recognition of Mongolian independence from China, and a recognition of Soviet interests in the Manchurian railways and Port Arthur; these were agreed without Chinese representation or consent. Stalin agreed that the Soviet Union would enter the Pacific War three months after the defeat of Germany.
&gt; 
&gt;
&gt; Roosevelt met Stalin's price, hoping the USSR could be dealt with via the United Nations. Later, many Americans considered the agreements of the Yalta Conference were a ""sellout"", encouraging Soviet expansion of influence to Japan and Asia, and because Stalin eventually violated the agreements in forming the Soviet bloc. Furthermore the Soviets had agreed to join the United Nations, given the secret understanding of a voting formula with a veto power for permanent members of the Security Council, thus ensuring that each country could block unwanted decisions.

You need to clarify what sorts of deaths you are talking about?  Total war deaths including civilian? Or armed services KIA?  Your numbers are to small to be civilian, and your count of USSR kia is high by a large margin. US KIA are are 435,000 and USSR around 11 million but can vary up to 1 million. Very hard to esitmate actuall USSR armed forces KIA due to methods of conscription.  In WW2 the Soviets suffered higher casualties then any other country involved. This was due to mainly poorly trained and equipped infantry used against highly trained and well equipped German armor and mechanized infantry.   Stalin adopted an ""at all costs"" attitude to combat the german advance.  USSR soldiers were probably among the bravest and fiercest fighters of the war stopping the  German advance and driving them all the way back to Berlin.  Another contributing factor to higher casualties in Russia can also be attributed to the much larger army of the USSR,  well over 35 million solders served the USSR in WW2.  Most of them as infantry.  

The USA contributed as many men to the conflict as the British.  One of the greatest American contributions was probably industrial, as a steady flow of planes, tanks and guns were shipped to the Allies faster than the Axis powers could destroy them. However US contributed heavily to the conflict in Europe and much American blood was spilled on the soil all across Europe liberating conquered nations from Germany.  Movies made in America by Americans and for Americans are obviously going to highlight America's contributions in WW2.

The USSR did have the earliest great victory in WW2 at the Battle of Khalkhin Gol.  This is something I would like to see a movie about as I think it had a great impact on the outcome of WW2.

I think that number of attacks from MS on other *IT* companies (including FLOSS distributors) has the same order of magnitude as attacks on MS other *IT* companies (including FLOSS distributors) or their attacks on each other etc.

Therefore I think that in this question MS is 'evil' no more than most of IT companies, just like TomTom is not 'good' no more. They all just use methods of competition supported by legislation, no matter how bad it is.

One can either despise most IT companies for these methods, try to eliminate possibilities for them through law changes or tolerate them. I prefer second, because I can't change US or EU legislation and it's hard for me to give vent to my bile too often. That's what all my 'changing arguments' were about, sorry for unclearness.

Now this attempts are found to be unfruitful, so they look for a way to make it profitable for them (like IBM did before), i.e. coming into patent agreements with FLOSS distributors or stimulating Windows/.NET developers (including their own) to write more FLOSS code (to increase popularity of Windows, of course, not for some ideological aim).

I do understand it enough to categorize it. The principle is quite simple, there is a ""central planner"" at the central bank that tries to manipulate the system to achieve his desired goals. As much as you might want to argue that this is not the case, this is the principle that drives all central banks and really all forms of government.

The problem with central planning is one of scope. In a free market system, there can still be some degree of central planning, like when an agency makes rules for how stock market trading is accomplished. At issue here though is how much central planning is responsible for and how much is left up to non-planned, free market economics.

The USSR is an example of a completely centrally planned economy and it failed miserably. The US is an example of a minimally planned economy and Canada falls between these two extremes. The interesting point here though is that the more a society uses central planning to accomplish it's economic goals, the worse off they are. It's not blind luck that the US is the worlds economic powerhouse, while the USSR (and Canada) fall well behind it.

You can claim that you're happy being in second place, but the discussion here is what produces the best results. Central planning fails time and time again.

True,1426043235,1252696799,-1,"&gt;Yup. It was (and is) a major primary cause of the entire ""Health[S]Care"" crisis.

That's a pretty bold claim. Medicare didn't cause private insurance to have huge overhead. Go ahead and factor in malpractice. A doctor in Canada or western Europe pays a tenth of what an American doctor pays for this coverage. Medicare has nothing to do with private insurance's *legal obligation* to prioritize profit over quality of service. Medicare doesn't make private insurance deny people coverage over pre-existing conditions.

&gt;Until Medi-""Care"" [sic] f'd over the health care system in the US (admittedly also in collusion with the AMA's antics and the tax policy provisions that drove major monies into tax-exempt company &amp; union insurance policies) -- until then, doctor visits and even hospitalization were relatively cheap, easily accessible, and not a huge ""problem.""

You're saying that the government forced private health care to behave in regards to corporate and union coverage? Which then caused private insurance to become more expensive? No, private insurance became more expensive because it could. Because there was no price competition in the market. They could charge what they wanted, because a person's health is critical to them and they'll pay anything to stay alive.

Yes, I'm aware of that program. As I said, ""He started many social programs focused on poverty."" But he didn't start the welfare program.

You appear to have been listening to a substantial amount of right-wing talk radio. Nothing wrong with that, I guess, but I think it may have given you a slanted picture of LBJ and his domestic policy.

If it's a protected bike lane common in Europe and gaining popularity in NYC where it's basically the road &gt; parking lane &gt; strip of sidewalk &gt; bike lane &gt; actual sidewalk there are a few problems.  First off, at times you have to be careful not to get doored from the passenger side if the barrier is thin enough that a door could stretch past it.  On top of that you have people standing around in the lane or crossing it to get into their cars.  Unlike in the street, however, where you can dodge jaywalkers and people on cell phones, you're now enclosed in a relatively narrow track and have few options.  What if you come across some idiot riding the wrong way or a slow moving family of cyclists?

I love the idea of protected bike lanes, and I've never used them myself so I can only really convey what I've read, but I prefer being in the road where I have more space to ride and pass people if need be.  If I'm riding a bike path that swings up from the road onto a sidewalk I always just ride on the road.  I'd rather take my chances with cars then have to dodge pedestrians.

One of the issues it seems is that everyone plays the political party game as though it is about sports.  There seem to be fairly normal moderate voices in the party, I'm fairly certain that I even heard Tom Ridge making sense recently.  Some are Christians who actually believe the family values line that the party espouses, some are libertarians (with a small l) others still are small government conservatives and fiscal conservatives who want to see reduced spending, but not a return to the gold standard (which is utterly unworkable anyway) and of course a mix of the above.  Ron Paul however comes across as having a wide support base on the net, some support in specific areas, but essentially a one trick pony.  Even on Reddit you will hear people lauding his economic views but being turned off by his other apparent positions.  I don't think that you could claim that Ron Pauls position is more representative than the neoc-on one, nor that the majority of conservatives fall into either.  However the right wing media isn't exactly entirely neo-con either.  Sure fox spouts that kind of position at times, especially some of its better known talking heads, but then that's fox.

Just to clarify, I am neither an American, nor a Conservative (I'm a British socialist...) but even I can look at the US, especially the media, as I often do, and see that the Government needs to deal with the whacking great propaganda machine arrayed against it.  Hell, if you think that Obama won by only about 8% when pitted against McCain (who lets face it wasn't even in the same league as Obama) and Palin (who was practically insane in her positions and outpourings) it suggests that there are a large number of people who eare swayed by the right wing media and will happily follow their 'team' in the absence of any sense coming the other way.

Lastly, I would say that Obama hardly comes across as someone on the left, the entire Democratic movement in the US appears right wing to most Europeans, so the demarcation of what is right wing press and what isn't is a little hard to spot.

**Competitive sports** - I think that the concept of ""them"" and ""us"" is what gets us into such sticky situations and the idea leads to killing. When you dehumanize the enemy, especially when they are still human, it brings us all down a peg. I'm totally for sports with true sportsmanship, and friendly competition, but we have little of that today.

**Decentralized child care** - I think that our ancestors had it right that children would be raised within village care and not subject to individual parents. Couples run the gamut between dreadful and amazing, but its their life to live. If they are unfit to raise children but can survive on their own, let someone else take care of children who wants to.

**Hallucinogens** - Let's face it: pretty much anyone who has ever done a hallucinogenic drug feels born anew. I think a lot of close minded people, if only to take a drug once - once - could have a completely new understanding of life without all the downsides of drug usage. 

**Short term thinking** - Right now, our concern is with health care, equality, energy, etc. What really we should be doing is finding a way off the planet. If there's anything that will ensure the future of humanity it's making our way off this planet so that individual groups with different ideas can stake their claim somewhere else to make a better life.

**Work in general** - A lot of European countries have crazy amounts of vacation time, and yet their economy is fine. I believe every developed country can do even better.

Either way, whether accepted or simply swept under the rug, point is: it made money - cotton, tobacco, tea and so on would not have been such profitable enterprises otherwise.

Many people today (in America and other overly-religious countries) view abortion as bad... and nobody else does.

2) Find trillions for wars but not be able to get a few billion so everyone can be covered by health care, then I'd give more power to the federal reserve system so no one can audit it and discover its a sham organization neither federal or a reserve making money out of thin air, while raking in billions of interest into the hands of a few private interests who fund the ""Punch and Judy"" puppet show two party political system that gets people like me into power to continue their agenda, any one who dares to look behind the puppet show curtain will be called a right wing conspiracy theorist by the controlled media.

3) Start the merging of my country with Canada and Mexico without the consultation of my people using administrative process's that allow a slip stream merger with the European Union in time, I'd disguise it by calling it a trade agreement (nafta), then while promoting the false idea of global warming i would give the carbon trading rights of my country to the UN so they can have a carbon tax to fund the one world government, then I'd collapse my countries economy stealing halve the middle class's wealth so they cant get to large and then have them beg me to give trillions to wall street or loose the other halve, any one who questions this will be called a right wing conspiracy theorist by the controlled media.

After that i would probably have a nice sandwich and sit back in a big chair and laugh like doctor evil with Dick Cheney on how stupid people are.

Americans need to understand that the root of all their current problems is the two party political system which keeps the same agenda going as mandated by the globalist elite who are pushing for a one world government and using America as a foreign military corporation to achieve this. 

Clinton/Bush and Obama sold them out.

Clinton did the ground work, Bush did the hard work and now Obama with his fancy speeches is trying to make them feel good about what happened.

If they Vote independents only they have a chance, but then again they seem to mostly be in denial and have no chance of understanding whats happening. ... just as the powers that be knew.

True,1426043754,1252769552,2,"I understand there are misconceptions but they are not consistent with what I said.

&gt;**The most typical libertarian plan calls for a remaining police force and a consumption tax to pay for it. So basically, those with no property are forced to subsidize the protection of other's property.**

Not true (although a police force does far more than just protect property).  I earlier described a pigovian business tax model.  No individuals were taxed - I even argued that no individual should ever have to fill in a tax form.  What you might have is some people who think the term libertarian applies and have jumped on some pseudo Ron Paul definition bandwagon.  Invariably right wing libertarians might only want very limited social programs...but how those are paid for can come from many places.

&gt;**But that's no surprise because every single idea of libertarianism seeks to benefit the wealthy, punish the poor, and erode the middle class.**

Really?  Even though this libertarian just advocated a default zero tax for the individual, zero tax on income, universal healthcare and argued for the need to provide education to all regardless of wealth.  N.B. I said 'the individual', not the rich individuals, or the poor individuals, or the middle class ones.  Individuals.  All of them.

&gt;&gt;I would not, if I were black or female, want to be employed by a bigot compelled to hire me.

&gt;**If you needed a job you would.**

No, I have a higher moral standard than that.  In all good conscience I would not work for someone, producing profit for them, when I knew that that person's behavior is bad for me, bad for people like me, bad for my community.  People have literally died, been imprisoned or gone through life long terrible suffering to exact some of these cultural changes.  Holding up a job search for something that doesn't fuel bigotry is no biggy.  Jobs aren't hard to come by.  Good jobs that you enjoy and pay well are.  Some jobs require you to sell yourself out; physically or spiritually.  I'd settle for the first whilst looking for the second but I would never go for the third.

You arguing that I could end up working for a bigot also ignores the other point I made that market forces would take care of the issue.  Not only would I not work for a bigot: as a white male if I went to a hotel in the western world and saw a sign over the reception saying 'no blacks' and a side door for women to use....I'd book in elsewhere.  I strongly suspect others would too.  Boycotts work and businesses are there to make money.  If they don;t they either change or die.

&gt;**America had a century with no Civil Rights Act, and free market principles did not prevent businesses to discriminate. I don't see how you can have the brass balls to pretend otherwise.**

Because culturally you've moved on.  Now you don't need a law saying that a black woman has to give up her seat.  You try demanding it and you'll see black and white men and women telling you what they think of you.  My brass balls come from understanding and whilst they are impressive can get rather cold in the winter.  

&gt;**Tax the hell out of corporations? I'm down with that.**

Good.  That is in itself a libertarian action...unless it is an altruistic corporation, but then again, there aren't very many of them.

&gt;**You are the most progressive libertarian I have ever met.**

Thankyou.  Although I'm far from being a pathfinder on the margins.  Academic or European/Canadian Libertarianism tends to be more of the same.  The problem is that some US Constitutionalists confuse Libertarianism with defining only themsleves - which it never was and some reformists and progressives who wish to build on the constitution also confuse the issue.  The founding fathers limited government a libertarian action based on some of the most progressive philosophical thinking of the time - 40 years later the Norwegian constitution built on it again.  Libertarian is progressive, US constitutionalists believe in aspects of libertarianism. 

&gt;**Uh, if you dump chemicals in the ground you are going to pollute the water supply. There's no getting around it.**

Well no, it was making a point.  If I walk out into the middle of my lawn and use a bucket of weed killer it is chemicals in my lawn.  If it does not harm anybody else, doesn't stop the neighbors from having a weedy garden in case they like it like that.  Fine.  If I go and dump large amounts of chemicals in my garden that put the local kids into rashes and asthma then it is not fine.

&gt;**So by my understanding, you do not have the right to pollute someone else's air at all. So cars are banned in a libertarian society? Smoking cigarettes is banned in a libertarians society? Or should we have laws saying a certain small amount is OK but large amount are not i.e. the current system?**

I just said that with right comes responsibility.  If you have a car that damages the environment part of the tax revenue generated from the making of that car and the running of that car goes to readdressing the balance.  Cars aren't banned, the worst polluters may become financially nonviable for all but the ardent.  Whatever they take out is put back.  You can still drive them - you just can't force the effects on others without addressing relevant environmental compensation.  

If you want to smoke - fine.  If you want to run a smoking bar - fine.  The person who runs the building gets to decide and you get to decide which building you go into.  If there are three bars on a street and all three have a red no-smoking sign in their doors.  Fine.  I'd expect a 4th to appear with green or blue smoking sign or one of the three to change if there is a market.  But 'No'...we should not have laws to say a little bit is fine as we have now.  Who gets to decide which is a little, what is too much...who monitors, who profits?  Why do you need someone telling you what to do and why would you not want to be empowered of making your own choices?

True,1426043810,1252777058,12,"No. And I *seriously* didn't mean that in a sarcastic way.

There are always ""good moves"" (or at least moves that are ""better"" or ""safer"" and others that are ""worse"" or ""riskier"") but one often doesn't know which is which until AFTER the fact.  

And, other than the $40K figure and the vagueness of you being 13-15 years from retirement (at age ???) -- we lack any/all information about the context of your situation.

To pull a quote from Tolkien:
*""Advice is a dangerous gift, even to the wise from the wise, and all courses may run ill. But what would you? You have not told me all concerning yourself; and how then shall I choose better than you?""*

What I mean by that is how are you situated otherwise?

* Is the house paid off? (or almost?) -- OR, did you refinance and pull out substantial equity and still have 20 years on the new mortgage?

* Other major debts and payments?

* What OTHER savings do you have and how are they invested?  (IOW is the $40K the whole kit-and-kaboodle or is it just some extra money, and you have $500K in CD's and Money Markets).

* Household situation -- Wife? Children? Empty Nest?

* Retirement Income -- are you relying MAINLY on some pension? Social Security? Savings? or ???

* Goals/Plans/Hobbies/Side-business or skills -- i.e. what are you planning to DO in retirement? (There's a big difference between someone who can't wait to retire to devote more time to his woodworking hobby-business but otherwise wants a quiet life -- versus someone who wants to spend 3 months golfing in Arizona, a month sipping Mai-Tais in Honolulu or Cancun, and the rest skipping around Europe.)

A lot has changed in the world -- many things have been flipped upside-down (and others are headed there) -- I know people who were highly leveraged, and ""flying so high"" that they thought (and acted) as if they were among the truly wealthy; and they laughed at my situation and investment &amp; lifestyle choices as recently as just two years ago and told me I was an utter *fool* when I pulled everything out of the stock market in late 2007 and early 2008.  BUT NOW things have changed rather dramatically, and they have lost (and are losing or will lose) virtually everything they *thought* they had and were depending on.  NOW they come to me for advice, but in the FULL context of their situation, the path that I chose is not really of much help to them, as the holes they have dug cannot be filled (and the investments that I made 5 years ago are no longer available).

**But if you DEMAND advice...** then in general, I would say you need to TRULY diversify (not just ""diversified"" all in the stock market/mutual fund BS way -- we've seen how THAT plays out, and it is not good). What it means to truly diversify NOW is to make certain you are not ""all in"" in anything in particular -- don't have everything in stocks or even ""dollar-denominated"" things. Batten down the hatches for the ""storm"" that has started and the ""bigger storm"" that is likely to hit. 

That means making certain you have ""essentials"" on hand (months, rather than days worth of food -- you're going to eat it anyway, why not stock up &amp; maintain a stock) -- same with other things.

Likewise, don't have all of your accounts at one Bank ([especially these days](http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.html) -- yeah it's ""insured"" but it might get ""tied-up"" for a while as happened to WaMu people, and there is probably worse yet to come).

If you ""bet"" on stocks and/or bonds, be prepared for the fact that it is ALWAYS a gamble -- but that especially with the present volatility things can change in an instant, and a particular stock may go from being valued at 20% to 50% above what you paid to 20% to 50% below what you paid -- and it can happen while you are fetching groceries -- and then can unexpectedly come back up while you're sitting on the john a week later.

Bonds are supposedly ""safe"" and give a small return -- but with the unprecedented things happening (GM declared bankruptcy??? I predicted this several years ago and everyone LAUGHED, because they thought it IMPOSSIBLE. But look how fast it happened. Same is possible even of Government and ""utility"" bonds; though exactly which or when is anyone's guess.)

Gold &amp; Silver -- possibly could skyrocket in value, but like all commodities are subject to wide swings of sentiment and speculation in between.

Real Estate -- need we really discuss this? There are ""bargains"" out there in foreclosures, but is the location a future ""good"" one??? And can you, do you WANT or are you capable of being a landlord, handling repairs, actually *collecting* rents, etc?

Skills -- even *if* you end up being able to ""retire"" in 13-15 years (and with all that has happened in the past year alone, how different will the world BE in 13-15 years) -- but even then you are likely to need SOME type of skills/talents that can generate income. Do you have them? In a timespan as long as 13-15 years you should be able to acquire/adapt yourself to some new things.

And by diversifying -- rather obviously it is like ""betting"" on multiple horses -- many or even most of them may fail, and yet one of them may ""win"" substantially enough to keep you solvent. *But at a minimum you need to understand that SOME of them will ""fail"" and you WILL lose some value (no matter which set you choose) -- and you need to be comfortable with that. (The alternative is that you put all your eggs in one basket -- turn off your concerns -- and if you are lucky, you win big, but if not, you potentially lose everything.)

As for whether you should pull out of the market NOW -- or wait a week (month/year) and do it then... try flipping a coin, or having a monkey toss a dart -- it is just as likely that THAT will produce the best choice as any advice anyone else can give you.

**""Men are corruptible.""**

I didn't consciously lay the trap I've heard the argument made this way too many times.
""People are evil and need to be restrained."" but whose to restrain them? more people who are evil. and by order of restraining them you give them power to do more damage.
I dispute this as an absolute, but people are human, to give them the power over so many lives is foolish.

Again what do they have that the U.S. doesn't? What makes up this 'highest standard'?

&gt;we could attain a better balance that provided the social benefits without the constraints of a nanny state.

You're trying to evoke an argument *against* the nanny state while championing social benefits? 

&gt;Why is freedom important?

Lacking freedom you lack power. Lacking power you lack control. Lacking control makes you something of, if not effectively a slave.

&gt;liberty, equality, and fraternity ... three competing virtues in the formulation of the ideal society. If everyone is free, since men and women are not born equal, there can be no equality of resource and no feelings of brotherhood

Okay liberty, equality, fraternity come from the point of  a gun apparently (force)?
My feelings of friendship have nothing to do with me and how my friend and I feel for one another, it's all about living under a government.
My displays of respect toward others is not about, respect for them or myself -- government.
 
&gt;which are necessary to prevent civil war and make democratic compromise necessary.

This seems sort of like patriotism. Unearned virtue for having lived in some place *""We're better because we're american.""* or something. I think this kind of thing is what *makes* civil war.

&gt;It is the balance of these three ideals, ...  I believe creates a society with a high standard of living.

Hmmm You may actually have a point.
I wouldn't go so far as fraternity, I think *a sense* of equality would cover it. People don't have to love their fellow man, just respect.
Can these be forced? if so, I still question if they should they be forced?

&gt;If a man steals to eat and is punished, property has been valued higher than life. In some instances, the right to life comes in direct conflict with your ability to own all the stuff in your pile.

Cool, I'm coming to eat are your house tonight!
That's the converse. Why should I grow grain, harvest it, make bread, or pay someone who does when I can just come take it from you?
As life is the highest value, you have to give me food, and whoever else shows up. In order to feed everyone you have to work harder. I do not work. Why work I can take it from you lest starve to death. You have no right to your property. 

&gt;Do you have the right to deny that man some of your bread, 

Yep, You betcha!

&gt;or does he deserve to die because he could not provide for himself? If he deserves to die, has anyone ever starved to death without deserving it?

See here's the thing ... just because I don't give him bread doesn't mean he will die. It could, but you and X many other people did not give him bread either. If this is important, you can organize a thing and figure it out, If I feel similarly I might even contribute myself, but forcing such an arrangement turns people into a sort of slave and is immoral.

You can judge me, and perhaps you should, but to command me to do things your way is a vile and conceited sort of arrogance.

&gt;So violence only exists in cities, you know those places where everyone lives in close proximity? How does that observation not prove my point? When you get a large enough group together, conflict inevitably ensues. It is the nature of the beast, and the beast is us.

I'm a beast, cool!
Again, you're giving power to the beast.
How many people have you killed lately? Surely there's been an opportunity to kill somebody with minimal risk of being caught or captured? Why didn't you? I suppose it's just the risk and hassle of covering up the crime etc. etc.  Otherwise you would have done it. &lt;smirk&gt;

True,1426044081,1252787046,2,"&gt; These countries often were complicit with the Nazis in trying to exterminate Jews

""These countries"" weren't complicit - local militias organized  by the Nazis were.   The Nazis used the worst elements of the local society for their purposes.  On their own, these societies did not unleash these elements. It's a bit like saying ""Jews were complicit with the Nazis"" because *some* Jews collaborated in rounding up other Jews.

There are some fair points here, if expressed by someone more honest than Milne.  But the history is more complicated than Milne makes it out.

The Baltics, for example, were caught between Russia and Germany.    Let's look at Latvia. The Russians invaded them *first* as part of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, followed by an immediate liquidation of the governing elite.  The Nazis then invaded, killed 100K Jews with the aid of militias *they had set up.*  Also, 100K Latvians were killed after being conscripted by both armies.    After the war,  100K Latvians were deported to Gulags, 130K fled to the West, then another 40K were sent to Gulags in 1949.   And then Russia  flooded the country with Russian speakers, to destroy it's ethnic identity.  

The Holocaust was one important aspect of the war in Latvia, but any Latvian participation was not an act sanctioned by the nonexistent Latvian state.   

If you look at events in toto you can understand why the Latvians might think that Stalinism and Nazism are equally evil.

Yet all that Milne can say is:

&gt; There's no doubt that the pact of August 1939 was a shocking act of realpolitik by the state [USSR] that had led the campaign against fascism since before the Spanish civil war.

USSR?  The state that 'led the campaign against Nazism'?    Old Joe and his Gulags?  That's like calling the Crips a noble crimefighting group because they happen to oppose the Bloods!  Can you *see* how dishonest Milne is being?

&gt; But the pretence that Soviet repression reached anything like the scale or depths of Nazi savagery – or that the postwar ""enslavement"" of eastern Europe can be equated with wartime Nazi genocide – is a mendacity that tips towards Holocaust denial.

Yet we know that the Soviets killed roughly four million in the deliberate famine of the Holodomor.   So much for Milne's honesty!

True,1426044474,1252836913,12,"Thomas Malthus conjectured that population growth rate is exponential while increases in crop technology only showed linear advances - thus we would always have starvation.

This is the theory you're talking about.

Thankfully, it isn't true for two reasons and part of why it appears to be true is a modern mis-observation.

First the observation problem: in the time of Malthus people really were starving to death because of crop failures. It happened regularly. These days there is enough food to feed the world; people die today of hunger because of government (the governments of China and Russia have *much* to answer for - as does the World Bank for its experiments in Africa in the 60s and 70s) or, more commonly, because hunger is used as a weapon in war (Africa).

Now the first reason why the mechanic doesn't hold: food production has gotten exponentially better, not linearly. We've just been that damn good - and we've remained good at improving crops. If even a few more portions of the world could be brought up to modern American farming technology, we'd see another exponential increase in food.

The second reason is more important, though. Malthus assumed that there was no negative relationship between birthrate and food security - because in small doses what we see is when humans get some food security they have a lot more babies.

But when people get enough food security that the majority of their population are no longer farmers, the fertility rate drops dramatically and quickly. People stop having 9 kids because it's just no longer necessary.

There are a few effects like this in the world that are readily observed. Child labor is one of them. When a society becomes rich enough, their kids stop working in factories and instead go to school. It's predictable and certain. Want to stop child labor? Raise the standard of living.

Another one of these is environmental damage. Societies go through a rough start early on where they do not value their environment - because putting food on the table is more important. Once a society rises to a certain level, the environment they live in starts becoming more important. We've watched it happen in the US, Europe, portions of South America.

It is not just vain of us to talk about changing the culture of others but it is pointless; once their society advances the fertility rate *will* drop.

True,1426044474,1252837016,10,"Corn isn't really the cause (though subsidizing it is idiotic). For example, some European countries actually have more obese people than the US. The problem isn't what you eat, but in what quantities. Even healthy food can make you obese if you eat enough of it.

Quite honestly, I don't see how government mandates can do anything about the situation, short of forcing people to adopt a certain diet. And this fat tax could be an absolute nightmare *and* inefficient. How do you determine what is ""fattening food""? For example, do you only tax drinks with sucrose? Because that leaves fructose for soft drink manufacturers to use. You could tax added fructose, but that would leave juices and rest, which I suppose could be promoted as healthy, but in reality are about as fattening as sucrose soft drinks. And then there are diet soft drinks which aren't exactly good for you and some studies have actually found artificial sweeteners to induce a similar insulin response as sugar. Which by itself isn't really fattening, but accomponied by calorie-rich foods, will result in the body storing far more fat. So the whole thing will be a bureaucratis nightmare.

True,1426044485,1252840142,1,"I alluded earlier to a client who is a special case. I'll call him Bob. Bob is moderately retarded (I think), and he does talk. He has an electronic wheelchair that he can control with a joystick, and he enjoys crawling on the ground. He is among my clients because the other more functional clients hate him. Why? He says things they don't like - I can't be more specific without possibly revealing identifying information, but he has a few phrases and cliches he uses willy-nilly, and he talks a lot about his girlfriends, of which he has several, and his parents, doctors, etc. He likes to ask people to be his mother or father, or tell them that they are no longer his mother or father. And he is passionately in love with a staff member, so a large part of my job is keeping him distracted so this other staff member (and other female staff in general) can get their work done. I distract him by giving him items to hold (usually by placing them on his head. He likes to be helpful, so if I ask him to do it, he will, at least until he gets bored or realizes I'm just teasing him), or loud toys, or magazines (he likes the pictures in National Geographic), or asking him questions about what he had for dinner, whether or not his brother is still a girl (I've never met his (younger) brother, but Bob tells me all the teasing that goes on back and forth, mostly they just tell each other that they're girls, or crybabies. Bob's brother is an adult, who works for UPS). Bob's family goes to an Assembly of God church, and Bob is deeply religious. He sometimes shouts things like ""Submit, woman!"", and is constantly asking either for permission to pray for others or for others to pray for his mother (she's sick) or someone else (sometimes, he asks people to pray for me to quit smoking cigarettes. I quit a few months ago, but he forgets). Since Bob is the only person I can really interact with, I'm very close to him, and I miss him when he's not around (usually because his mom is sick and he's staying at his grandmother's).

How do the profoundly retarded live? Well, most of ours live in a house my employer runs. The people who work there are barely paid anything, and are frequently cheated out of their checks (I could be too, though they haven't yet; over the last few months, they've instituted a range of new policies that retroactively lessen the time we are paid for). They steal from the clients, and outright refuse to do things like change diapers. Needless to say, they certainly don't do any activities, almost all of the time. There's a handful who are good, but they are rare. I have to beg for them to place two diapers and an extra pair of pants in the clients' backpacks every day, and they don't even do this much. Some still live with their parent(s) or other guardian, but these people require a lot of care, so not mostly. The parents who continue to take day-to-day care of an extremely disabled adult are an odd bunch: mostly very religious, like Bob's mother, and insanely devoted to their child. We have one client who has a Hollywood-level wardrobe - he comes in every day in a matching outfit, down to the unscuffed, pristine shoes, and his backup clothes almost always match too, so he still looks fashionable even after pooping his pants; his hair is always neat, and he is always clean-shaven. He looks like the president of the College Republicans. The funniest thing is, his mother, who spends thousands of dollars a year buying him clothes, puts no effort into her own appearance, at least every time I've seen her: ill-fitting, mismatched clothes, messy hair, no make-up...  Another guardian is a client's sister, who swears her brother tells her stuff by moving his eyes to indicate yes or no - I'm pretty sure this is entirely in her head, as his eyes move pretty much randomly. Another is supposedly a raging bitch (I've never met her) whose two adopted adults (she also has three adopted, retarded children) are always filthy, and sometimes literally have fleas because they live on her organic farm, where she raises goats and emu. They are only allowed organic food and lotion, which she provides.

We had a client who recently switched to a different program whom I have maintained a friendship with. He is officially mildly retarded (and therefore was never actually part of my group of clients), and is severely physically disabled - he can not walk, sit up, or grasp things without assistance. He is an immigrant from a country the US is not on excellent terms with, and speaks a non-English language that is not Indo-European (I'm pretty sure), so he's fluent in two languages. In ordinary conversation, he comes up with novel metaphors, and has said things that had one meaning for me and another directed at another person in the conversation. I strongly suspect that his ""retardation"" is caused by his being unable to complete any intelligence test, and being so limited in his experiences that he comes across as ill-informed. (Intelligence tests are mostly crap even in the best of circumstances anyway) I've worked with people who are not officially retarded who can't even understand simple, common metaphors or cliches, much less come up with their own on the spur of the moment.

There's a mildly-retarded lady whom I work with on occasion who has just turned ninety years old. And she still walks and talks, and feeds herself, and crochets, and is actually very mean and shouty to the other clients, whom she has little patience for.

Why does the tire making end up in China? Cheaper labor. Why is labor cheaper there? They get less from their work.

So is the solution to force tires being made in the US? Maybe not, because they'd get even less for their work, because there is less demand for work in China. Then again, maybe in the US they can produce more with the same labor, however this isn't an argument, because if they could produce enough more for the same labor, they would be competitive.

It would also be fairer if in both countries labor was valued similarly, but not at the expense of efficiency, that would be silly. We prefer to do other stuff then work, decide what we want to do ourselves. But are there enough jobs? Probably not, because we're arguing over how to distribute them, on the other hand, maybe we do want some more stuff being done for us.

There is another problem with placing the jobs where it is cheapest, it works against automatization. We don't want tonnes of demeanial jobs, maybe in the interim, while it makes the poor richer, but eventually we want them to be automated. However, there will still be many workers and perhaps not enough work, further the money goes to the investors, the rest just gets their wages. So we need to take the money and power where it pools and move it back to the people, which then should try work less to force companies to automate. Of course we're dealing with money and power there, so deal it with care!

So basically, it is only fair that jobs are going east, and we should suck it up with the decreased income. Of course there is another issue, how the wealth is spread, and what the new powers will do.

The first one relates to 'sucking it up'. The labor force would be fine, if the wealth distribution in the US wasn't so fucked up. European countries do much better in that respect.

As for the new powers, can we trust modern China? (On the other hand, can we trust the US, with their track record, they just barely escaped nuclear war, and fucked around in foreign countries frequently.)

Its on the order of tenths of a percent, but I can't remember the exact number. Also, in many animal societies, inbreeding actually culls the negative genes, making the remainder of the population fitter. (Cultural Anthropology First Edition, Serena Nanda, pg 209)

Also, according to Yéhudi Cohen (Faces of Anthropology, 5th ed. Authors Kevin Rafferty and Dorothy Ukaegbu, pages 155-161), the more advanced and interconnected a society becomes, the less likely there is to be an incest taboo. Take for example, modern America. Most states have laws against relations between only first cultures or closer. Sweden is on the verge of eliminating them entirely. However, in pre-industrial days, marriages were used to force alliances, therefore it was for the better of the society to force marriage outside the community/family, so as to forge these ties. And it is in medieval Europe and pre-Columbus America that we find the strongest socio-cultural oppositions to incest.

First, geography.  The United States is territorially enormous by comparison to Norway and parts south.  It is not a coincidence that most of the rabid  ""anti-socialist"" populists in the United States come from the center and southeast (we just call it The South, as the southwestern states came along following our Civil War) -- people in those areas literally are farther removed from foreign commerce, racial and social integration, and international travel.  A person born in Bergen in 1970 would have a damned hard time avoiding meeting people from other countries with different social systems, and a hard time avoiding foreign travel.  A person born at the same time just outside Atlanta, by contrast, would stand a good chance of never having learned a foreign language and never having left the United States (he would, however, feel under siege from Mexican laborers, with whom he never would mix socially).  American internationalism starts at the upper-middle-class.  If you're poor, you receive a lot of anti-tax, anti-regulation propaganda from corporate interests, and you have no primary personal experience to check it against.  The distinctions between social insurance and authoritarianism that seem so obvious to Norwegians and most any European are distinctions many American voters never have had to confront.


Second, and less easy to explain concisely, is the unique way that American politicians and corporate interests distinguished the American system from communism: The definitive line was actually a re-packaged variant of Marxist ideology, a promise that the Soviet system, not ours, would collapse beneath the weight of its own structural contradictions, not so much because authoritarianism would be reviled, but because free-market capitalism would be so structurally superior in its ability to deliver efficiency and innovation and to improve living conditions and personal happiness.  The equation was between ""economic freedom"" -- e.g., from taxes, regulation, environmental constraints, broader social responsibility -- and freedom qua personal liberty.  Americans are told from infancy that they cannot have personal liberty without lassies-faire economics.

For this sole crime is his lash reserved. The poor alone he pursues with all the little, low, rankling malice of a parish beadle. The poor alone are to have their liberties stripped from them. The poor alone are to have a system of duties prescribed to them. All the inhuman rigours and austerities he advocates for the public weal are reserved for those whose lives are already the most burdened. It is this that makes his work insufferable to me, that makes his words stagnate in my blood and settle in my brain. Such cowardly, venal, and above all, selfish bullying almost puts me beside myself. The torpedo touch of his extreme selfishness has come near to benumbing the life of the poor. Were it not that a certain number of them are required for performing the hard labour of the world I have no doubt he would be ready to put an end to their power of procreation, if that would help him to keep a pair of sleek geldings in his stable for his own use. I will do him this justice, however : I do not believe he would stand forward as the advocate of any abuses from which he himself did not reap some benefit, by defending which he did not in some way profit.
It was in the year 1807 that I launched my first attack upon his shameless and cruel, sophisms. By that time a pack of venal writers, although beginning to despair of seeing any good likely to come of the war -- so great had been the reverses inflicted by Napoleon on Austria, Prussia and Russia in turn -- were maintaining boldly that the war was in itself a great good, that war was the natural state of mankind, ""lively, audible and full of vent"", while peace was altogether ""flat, stale and unprofitable"", that war was the sinews of commerce, the prop of the altar and the throne, that it filled the pockets of the rich and carried off the surplus population from among the poor. So wanton, so dazzling, so beautiful, with its crimson spots and warm glossy fur did this darling plaything of the imagination seem to those who were far removed from it ! In all this I saw much of Malthus, although I never could understand how such a miserable reptile performance as his could have crawled itself into such credit. More than twenty years have passed since I first did battle with the ice-cold adder-like selfishness which he elevated into a virtue and employed for the single purpose of torturing the poor, under the pretence of reforming their morals. In all these years nothing has hurt and angered me more than the tone, to a great extent initiated, familiarized, Christianized or at least made respectable by him, adopted so often in what would be thought ""good company "", towards those who are termed ""the lower orders "". I cannot describe the contempt and disgust I have felt when I have witnessed the sleek, smiling, glossy, gratuitous assumption of superiority to every feeling of humanity, honesty, or principle, making part of the etiquette and moral costume of the table, and every profession of toleration or favour for "" the lower orders "", that is, for the great mass of our fellow-creatures, treated as an indecorum and breach of the harmony of well-regulated society. I have felt, when witnessing this sealing of every feeling of nature under the smooth, cold, glittering varnish of pretended refinement, that I would rather see the feelings of our common nature expressed in the most naked and natural way, that the brutality of mobs is more endurable than the inhumanity of polite society, even as a bear's garden is preferable to an adder's den.

Throughout my life-time the shadow of distress has been laid upon the labouring poor, caught between one war and another. 'The poor sleep little !' I have never heard any poor man complain of this, seldom have heard complaint made of the hardness of their labour, but what has been most grievous to them of late years is that no man, however hardworking -- and some of the farmers' men have been absolutely ground into the earth with toil -- could be sure that insecurity and poverty would not overtake him. It is this that sometimes drives a poor man to spend on drink the money he sorely needs for bread, because, alas ! to the labouring poor it is often more important to forget the future even than to satisfy their present wants. The extravagance and thoughtlessness of the poor arise, not from their having more than enough to satisfy their immediate needs, but from their not having enough to ward off impending ones -- in a word, from desperation. This sense of insecurity presses hardly less than hunger itself. As for hunger, I can hardly remember a time when it was not taken for granted that the poor suffered from it. Indeed, so much was this taken for granted in the first years of the war that the recruiting places in the towns had pieces of beef hung up over them, by way of bait for the meagre half-famished groups of men wandering about and seeking work. It is a fearful shame and calamity that this should be so. The greater part of a community ought not to be paupers or starving. When the interests of the many are thus regularly and outrageously sacrificed to those of the few, the social order needs repairing. A street lined with coaches and with beggars dying at the Steps of the doors, gives a strong lesson to common thought and political foresight, if not to humanity. And those of us who satisfy our appetite at the Bond Street pastrycook's, would do well to remind ourselves, when we see the gaunt faces staring at us through the glass door, that though custard is nicer than bread, bread is the greater necessity of the two, and that the poor man has been known to fight for it.

These things are the signals hung out to show that some kind of reform is necessary. Otherwise a national bankruptcy becomes inevitable, or even a revolution. How this reform will be carried out, it is not easy to predict, but one thing is certain, that it must come from the energy of the poor themselves. I know that the poor, if they continue to be submissive as sheep, will be treated worse than sheep in return for their submissiveness. How often on Salisbury Plain have I watched a flock of sheep, biting the short sweet grass, or lying with 'meek mouths ruminant' ! They pass their time very comfortably, till they are fit to be sent to market. I have heard them fill the air with a troublous cry, as they pass down Oxford Street, on their way to Smithfield. The next morning it is all over with them. Yet while they lived, their time was on the whole pleasant. But Governments have not the same reason for taking care of ""the lower classes"", poor, poor dumb mouths! that the shepherd has for taking care of his flock : they do not ordinarily sell them, nor do they eat them. Perhaps it would be fitter to compare the condition of the poor to that of the beasts of burden, asses, or, 'camels in their war', who

 'have bare provender
Only for bearing burthens, and sore blows
For sinking under them'.
The salvation of the poor, I am convinced, must come from within their own ranks. Otherwise, it will never be won. When I see the lower classes of the English people uniformly singled out as marks for the malice of a certain kind of servile writer, when I see them studiously separated, like a degraded caste, from the rest of the community, with scarcely the attributes and faculties of the species allowed them, although it is to them we owe the valour of our naval and military heroes, the industry of our artisans and labouring mechanics, and all that we have been told, again and again, elevates us above every other nation in Europe; when I see the "" redundant "" population, to use the term that has become the more fashionable, selected as the butt for every effusion of paltry spite, and, as the last resource, of vindictive penal statutes ; when I see every existing evil derived from these unfortunate classes, and every possible vice ascribed to them ; when I see the poor, the uninformed, the friendless put, by tacit consent, out of the pale of society ; when their faults and wretchedness are canvassed and exaggerated with eager impatience, while still greater impatience is shown at every expression of a wish to amend them; when they are familiarly spoken of as a sort of vermin only fit to be hunted down and exterminated at the discretion of their betters, I know pretty well what to think, both of the disinterestedness of the motives which give currency to this jargon, and of the policy which should suffer itself to be influenced by its suggestions.
For my part, I place my heart in the centre of my moral system. I do not look on the poor man as an animal, or a mere machine for philosophical or political or economic experiments. I know that the measure of his suffering is not to be taken with a pair of compasses or a slip of parchment. I would rather be proscribed and hunted down with him than join in his proscription by those who made it their practice to attack the weak and cringe to the strong. I shall never cease to scorn those who trample on him and seek to wrench his pittance from him with their logical instruments and lying arguments ; who, if they do not starve him outright, would reduce his wages to what is barely necessary to keep him alive, and yet refuse him a morsel for charity when he can no longer work ; who, lest he should have any respite from fear or care or free himself for a moment from 'the killing frost of misery' hold 'the grinding law of necessity' ever suspended over him in terrorem.

OK, onward; Single payer systems fail at multiple points, not the least of which is: They have only one customer - The Government.

Under the *ideal* single-payer, The Government pays for everything. It also dictates who can charge how much for what. It collects revenue (taxes) effectively at gunpoint (robbery) and makes payments only as it sees fit (welcher). Those payments also lose value every year because the Government controls monetary policy, and it will decide how much to increase those payments each year based on formulas it creates to suit it's needs (Consumer Price Index).

If that isn't Socialist-Communist central-planning, I don't know what is.

And we all know how well that worked out for the USSR and its Eastern Europe satellite nations.

Going back to Japan. With an aging population, dropping birth rate, incredibly strict immigration (making the Swiss policy look inviting) and a falling standard of living, no one knows how they're going to continue making the payments on elder care and health care. Like our own Social Security/Medicare system, it's a massive Ponzi scheme which relies on the young healthy workers to pay enough taxes to cover current systemic expenses. They'll do it, somehow, because that's one of the highest expectations of them in their culture. But rest assured, their taxes will go up, their standard of living will drop and significant numbers of immigrants will be needed to prop up the economy.

Please, spare us false notions about how single-payer systems work so well elsewhere, and how it'll cure all our problems here.

Some interesting things: ""The study, which will be published in the upcoming issue of Journal of Biosocial Science, argues that natural selection favored more intelligent Jews during 800 years in Northern Europe, when Jews were genetically isolated and intellect was the most important quality for Jewish survival and biological fitness. As genetic evidence for the natural selection, the authors point to what they say is a complimentary group of genetic diseases prevalent among Ashkenazic Jews, including Gaucher disease and breast cancer.""
""“People invoke culture a lot, but in behavior genetics they can’t find that it’s really so,” said Gregory Cochran, who authored the study with a professor and a graduate student in the University of Utah’s anthropology department. “It’s something that people would like to be true, because it would make problems easier to fix.”""

Also, think--are most successful Jews religious? No, in fact Jews tend to be very secular as an ethnic group.

I've wondered about the Asian thing as well, and like you said--controlled immigration will yield distorted results from uncontrolled immigration (Hispanics) or forced immigration (blacks). This is part of the situation in the US, for sure. The trends are exaggerated in the US compared to other places. But studies I've seen adjusted for economic factors, and for country of origin, place natural intelligence in the same order every time--Asians, whites, Hispanics, blacks. Brain weight corroborates this as well.

Yes, subjective. But I think it's one of those things most people would admit if pressed. Black women have quite large, masculine facial features. White and Asian women have more delicate features and a slighter build. It is possible that Eurasian women evolved to be more beautiful once they had left Africa, because of certain environmental pushes. This can be discussed more.

Perhaps it's just an artifact of other factors. But go to a Canadian university. You'll see browns with browns, blacks with blacks, Asians with Asians, 90% of the time.

Being American and only American, I  can't speak to the UK or European idea of things, but I will agree wholeheartedly that Americans are highly individualistic.

From the time we are very young in public elementary school, we're taught that it was the individualism of a few people who did great things to make this country what it is. A few signers to the Declaration, a few key people in the Civil War, small groups of individuals thinking independently during WWII after D-Day (the book The Victors comes to mind). Individual families went West to ""civilize"" the wilderness. To travel the Oregon Trail through hardship and disasters and create cities and communities far from the industry and relative safety of the East.

We are taught these things from the time we are very small (part of US public education is to give us a sense of pride in our history and create a somewhat uniform national identity) and they help form our collective idea of the modal American personality.

Being fair to the different lengths of national histories, do you think that public education in the UK helps to form a national identity the way it does here? I honestly have no idea. I would think it does, but having never been exposed to an education system other than a public American one, I honestly don't know. I'm sure it helps us that we've only got like 300 years of history worth teaching.

Edited to add: for all that we're taught that individualism is great for this country, we still like being told what to believe and we trust almost without impunity those who tell us. We crave a group-think mentality and live only for our 15 minutes of famous individuality after which we're comfortable returning to the fold of sheepdom. I say this with full knowledge that I do it too. For all our individualism, we refuse to step too far out of line, stray too far from the safety of collectivism.

But the insurance companies have to make money or at least break-even.  I love my state-provided European healthcare, but if there is any possibility for private healthcare to work, one of two things must happen:

* everybody must be _forced_ to pay for insurance, otherwise people insure themselves only when they are ill and insurance companies lose money (hence the stupid things like pre-existing condition); this is what happens effectively when healthcare is funded with tax money.

* the government must take care of people that are subject to particular health-related problems (elderly people, victims of violence, veterans, people with congenital defects or rare diseases) so that the insurance companies wouldn't be able to leverage the pre-existing condition so effectively.

The latter would effectively mean allowing insurance companies to keep offering coverage for other health-related events, without worrying about domestic violence.  As you say, the government ought to offer all kinds of help to the victim, healthcare would be just one part of it.

Besides, there is another major problem even if the victims had total access to healthcare.  The doctor is put in a very difficult position when he visits a victim of violence, since he is torn between Hippocrates' oath and the duty of every citizen to denounce crimes that he gets to know about.  At least in Italy, the law forces the doctor to communicate the crime to the justice system (just as if he visited someone with a bullet wound).

True,1426044720,1252876361,0,"&gt;...iif you buy physical metals, you shouldn't be surprised if your ""investment"" turns out to be a bust. After all, what possible logical reason would there be for the simple ownership of an asset to provide a meaningful return, above and beyond inflation?

At least we agree, physical metals are a hedge against inflation and preserve wealth.  It is true that the gold (and particularly silver) markets can be volatile, but if the gold/silver markets collapse, I'll just buy more.

As for the logical reasoning why I'm so bullish on gold and (particularly) silver:

1 - China &amp; Russia has been stockpiling gold as a hedge against the falling value of the US dollar.  It appears as though China has been very careful not to upset prices in the Gold market.

2 - Gold buying season has started (September) where jewelry makers replenish their raw inventory (think India)

3 - China has publicly announced to its citizens to buy physical gold and silver.  Chinese do not like to ""loose face"" and the government would not have made this TV commercials if there was a significant risk of prices dropping.

4 - China has announced that it will be instructing its state-owned enterprises to potentially default on their derivatives contracts.  Further, they've indicated their will simply purchase any gold that gets dumped on the market to counter price-suppression. 

5- EU central banks are now net buyers of gold; no longer sellers.

6 - Barrick bets that gold rally has long way to go by eradicating more than half of its hedge contracts which have locked the company into receiving a fixed price for some of its gold production.

7- Gold to Silver ratio in the earths crust is about 1:10 but the spot prices are currently at 1:60.26 and the ratio is closing.  Unlike gold, silver is also an industrial metal that is consumed (an cannot be economically recovered)

8 - The value of the US Dollar is falling as the US electronic printing presses are on overdrive. China has announced it no longer has faith in the US dollar and sees US money printing as a way for the US to effectively default on their debts via inflation.

9 - Investors are beginning to understand that Gold ETFs are a scam and are exiting in favour of physical gold.

10 - There is a risk of another market collapse this fall (which is why I'm not in the market at all) and stocks are generally over-priced given these risks--they may continue to rise in nominal terms.

Anyway,  I see my position as a hedge against inflation with excellent potential for real profit in the short-mid term.  It's all about supply and demand vs gold futures contracts.",t3_9k2vh,c0d3pc3,,False,,,0,AskReddit,False,t5_2qh1i,0,t1_c0d3hzi,0,t1_c0d3pc3,[deleted],0

True,1426044773,1252882362,3,"&gt; That probably means it was unjust, couldn't have anything to do with Russia vetoing what it thought was the US enroaching on its patch.

China would also have vetoed it btw. It is not a case of the US encroaching on its patch. It is a case of the USA acting as “world police” and taking action unilaterally (usually with the aid of a few European states that it coaxed into a “coalition”). This is a lot like the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. 

&gt; There is no comparison between the Kosovo war and the Georgia war, you're either being silly or live near the Kremlin.

The two wars are remarkably similar (and I live 16 000kms+ away from the Kremlin). Firstly, both wars dealt with the issue of Balkanisation. That means ethnic minorities that assert their independence and nationalism. This simmering nationalism and identity was suppressed when it was part of the larger group (in Serbia’s case when part of Yugoslavia and in Georgia’s case when part of the USSR). 
In Ossetia it is ethnic Ossetians (half of which live in North Ossetia) and in Kosovo it is ethnic Albanians. 

The leadup to the Kosovo war is the Serbian army fighting the KLA and trying to re-assert Serbia’s control over Kosovo. 

In Ossetia Georgia wanted to assert its control over Ossetia by attacking Tskhinvali. It is popular for rightwingers to deny that Georgia tried to take control over Ossetia but this is not the truth. From [WP]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_South_Ossetia_war#The_Battle_of_Tskhinvali):

&gt; Early in the morning of 8 August, Georgia launched a military offensive, codenamed Operation Clear Field[137] to capture Tskhinvali. The Georgian 4th Brigade spearheaded the infantry attack, while the 2nd and 3rd Brigades provided support.[21] Georgian forces soon seized several South Ossetian controlled villages located on higher ground around the city.

In both cases there are allegations (and evidence) of ethnic cleansing by both sides. In both situations the region declared independence unilaterally. 

I don’t think that if you wanted to create a more similar situation you can.
