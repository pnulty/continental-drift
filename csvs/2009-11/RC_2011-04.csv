The reason media report this in Europe is because we've already been the victims of radiation leaks from faraway (Chernobyl).  Ask [Scottish sheep farmers](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/scottish-sheep-farms-finally-free-of-chernobyl-fallout-2020059.html) (and Welsh too) about that.

Some things to ponder:-

- Chernobyl used 500,000 people to stabilize their single reactor.
- Chernobyl had 10% of the fuel Fukushima has
- Chernobyl's 30km deadzone had less than half the radiation found 40km from Fukushima
- They won't collect dead bodies within a 20km radius from Fukushima

The above are facts, not sensationalism.  You might describe them as disturbing facts, and therefore sensational, but they are still facts. The situation is unfolding and generally over the last 3 weeks, the news has just been getting worse.  Given THAT, we might expect to hear even worse news than the above facts in due course.  Maybe we'll turn a corner though, and things will improve - it's very hard to say.  But I don't see how they will stabilize these reactors without employing hundreds of thousands of workers over months, as they can't entomb these reactors while they're still producing the kind of heat they are producing. In that case, there's little they can do to stop the leaks from spewing out more and more radiation over the coming days, weeks, months."

On the downside, smaller towns far from regional hubs are never easy ones in which to find support.  
  
I'd suggest contacting a local lgbt organization for a list of affirmative therapists, even if the lgbt organization is one of those with a silent 't'.  Then take it seriously.  Narrow the list down to 3-4 through phone conversations &amp; e-mail by asking questions like ""Have you ever had a trans patient before?"", ""Can you explain your approach to treating a person who is Gender Dysphoric?"", etc.  The actual answers actually matter much less than how it feels to talk with them.  Make a point of having an introductory meeting with at least 2, preferably 3, therapists.  A therapist you 'click' with is so much more important, since you're going to end up teaching them all they need to know regardless.  
  
Then expect it to go slowly.  You really just want to talk about it until you feel like it's beginning to make sense.  Eventually, you won't think ""what if I did XXX, how would that feel?"", instead you'll start approaching it with a perspective of ""well of _course_ that would be right and good and natural.""  Transition should (IMHO) feel empowering.  
  
And also don't listen to us.  I'm already starting to give advice in the previous paragraph which reflects my own experiences as much as a anyone else's.  Go slowly, know thyself, and be happy.

Pretty much, yes. Another choice quote:

*""Patents for medicines were introduced in Italy, under
pressure from foreign multinationals, in 1978. Today India, China
and Brazil are, reluctantly, caving in to U.S. pressure to do the
same. Proponents of IP argue that this will increase pharmaceutical
innovation in those countries. So we may ask – did the
strengthening of IP protection trigger a golden age of innovation in
the Italian pharmaceutical industry?
During the period 1961-1980 a total of 1282 new active
chemical compounds was discovered around the world. Of these, a
total of 119 came from Italy (9.28%). During the period 1980-1983
a total of 108 compounds were discovered. Of these, 8 came from
Italy (7.5%). While we do not have data covering the most
recent decades, the very clear impression of the informed observer
is that innovations have decreased. Professors Scherer and
Weisburst, in fact, took pains to carefully study the evolution of
the Italian pharmaceutical industry after the adoption of patents.
Here is the summary verdict, in Scherer’s own words:
Research by Sandy Weisburst and mentored by me showed,
for example, that Italy, with a vibrant generic drug
industry, did not achieve any significant increase in the
discovery of innovative drugs during the first decade after
the Italian Supreme Court mandated the issue of
pharmaceutical product patents.""* (pg. 251)"

Soviet Union and Nazi Germany had already divided Eastern Europe between them in Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Six days after Germany invaded Poland from the west, Soviet Union invaded Poland from the east and both armies stopped at predetermined border line.  Poland was divided by Germany, the Soviet Union, Lithuania and Slovakia. In  October and November 1940 Soviet union negotiated about joining Axis but it fell down because Hitler and Stalin did not trust each other enough. 

&gt;and tried to exterminate entire populations with gas chambers and such?

Some examples:

- Holodomor 1932-1933, the famine-genocide in Ukraine in Ukraina. 4-10 million dead (25% of population)
- Mongolian Great Purge, 18,000 killed.
- Stalins Great Terror, 1936 - 1939. 10 million killed, roughly 1.2 million of them were shot, others were starved in concentration camps. Stalin eliminated whole social class from Russia. 
- Stalins ethnic clenching during WWII. Executed 21,857 Poles. Put  400,000 Volga Germans, 1,000,00 Chechens, Crimean Tatars, Balkars, Kalmiks, and Turks into concentration camps (up to 40% died during transportation in sealed boxcars from lack of air, lack of  food and water or  from cold.

Surely, but that doesnt make it right, and if we're talking about what is right or moral then that is largely irrelevant

&gt;we don't need to needlessly harm animals (esp for beauty products...), but a cure for human cancer is of more relevance to our society.

I would say we agree here. My main point is that currently, a huge portion are needlessly harmed. We can do better.

&gt;It is seen as ethical to sacrifice the lives of a few to same the lives of many. Why? Because it allows the greatest amount of utility for the greatest number.

Yes via utilitarianism. However deontological ethics would disagree.

&gt;all higher species - simply ascribe higher value to our Selves than we do Others.

That we currently do something is not justification for it. I also dont deny that othering may have a strong instinctual basis. However, there are all kinds of instinctual behaviors that psych has identified which are irrational. Things like confirmation bias, cognitive dissonance etc etc. Rationality and objectivity are good, it's what we strive for. Yet man is *rationalizing* and subjective. These are things that man must overcome in order to reach what you could say is a ""higher level of being."" This is what Nietzsche's whole philosophy is about (I'm currently reading Thus Spoke Zarathustra). 

""The overman (Übermensch), a self-mastered individual who has achieved his full power, is an almost omnipresent idea in Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Man as a race is merely a bridge between animals and the overman. Nietzsche also makes a point that the overman is not an end result for a person, but more the journey toward self-mastery.

The will to power is the fundamental component of human nature. Everything we do is an expression of the will to power. The will to power is a psychological analysis of all human action and is accentuated by self-overcoming and self-enhancement. Contrasted with living for procreation, pleasure, or happiness, the will to power is the summary of all man's struggle against his surrounding environment as well as his reason for living in it.""

The last man is a term used to describe the antithesis of the Ubermensch, a weak-willed individual, one who is tired of life, takes no risks, seeks only comfort and security: the last man. Nietzsche saw that nothing great is possible for the Last Man, and it is Nietzsche's contention that Western civilization (Europe) is moving in the direction of the last man, an apathetic creature, who has no great passion or commitment, who is unable to dream, who merely earns his living and keeps warm.

&gt;They have the same moral agency.

I apologize, because I did not understand what was meant by moral agency. No a dog is not able to make the same moral judgments as a man. The way I misunderstood the question though was, does the rescuer have the same moral *obligation* to rescue both the man and the dog? I would say yes, based on their equal capacity to suffer. 

You argue no, because they are different species. But what does that MEAN, different in what specific respects? What characteristics makes one worth saving and not the other? The dog has different physical characteristics, legs, fur etc. But how is that conceptually different from deciding based on racial factors, ie skin color? Despite physical differences, the man and the dog have the same capacity for suffering, and on that basis, I argue, deserve equal consideration in saving. What if it were a dog and a tree in a ditch? Surely you would pick the dog, which means there is *something* about the dog worth saving. 

If you say no, man has morality/rationality but the dog does not, what if it were a dog and a baby in a ditch, or a mentally disabled person? What is the basis for choosing one over the other then? To justify by saying one is a man and one is a dog is no different than saying one is a man and one a woman, one is black one is white, one an apple the other an orange. Those are just labels. 

I think the Jeremy Bentham quote is worth repeating.

""The day has been, I grieve to say in many places it is not yet past, in which the greater part of the species, under the denomination of slaves, have been treated by the law exactly upon the same footing, as, in England for example, the inferior races of animals are still. The day may come when the rest of the animal creation may acquire those rights which never could have been withholden from them but by the hand of tyranny. The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor. 

It may one day come to be recognized that the number of the legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the os sacrum are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog, is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day or a week or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? the question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?""

The first written record comes from ancient Greece. At the annual Festival of Dionysia in Athens, playwrights competed to determine whose tragedy was the best. When the democratic reformer Cleisthenes came to power in the sixth century B.C., audience participation came to be regarded as a civic duty. The audience applauded to show its approval and shouted and whistled to show displeasure.

In ancient Rome, jeering was common at the gladiatorial games, where audience participation often determined whether a competitor lived or died. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the Latin verb explodere means ""to drive out by clapping, hiss (a player) off the stage.""

While people have expressed displeasure publicly since ancient times, the English word boo was first used in the early 19th century to describe the lowing sound that cattle make. Later in the 1800s, the word came to be used to describe the disapproving cry of crowds. Hoot, another onomatopoeic English word, was used as early as 1225 to describe the same phenomenon. (Ancient Greek and Latin both contain words resembling boo that mean ""to cry or shout aloud,"" though there is no known etymological connection to the modern English word.)

Whistling has long signified disapproval in Europe, as well as in South America. "

The hundreds or even a few thousand dollars charged by the eBay sellers, some of which apparently do a brisk business, judging by their ratings (some of them have quite high positive ratings) pale in comparison to the sums obtained by some forgers. E.g., see [Biblical artifacts](http://www.athenapub.com/biblical-artifacts.htm):

&gt;An ivory pomegranate (fig.1), once thought to be the top of a temple priest's scepter. Until recently on display in the Israel Museum, the pomegranate was believed to be the only known relic from Solomon's temple. This small artifact had an inscription partly encircling its neck which read ""Sacred donation for the priests of (in) the House of [Yahw]h,"" identifying it with the Temple. Pomegranates were ancient symbols of fertility, and a motif known to be used in the Temple of Solomon (1 Kings 7:21). All of this is now moot, since the pomegranate has been withdrawn from view, and the Museum has announced that it is a fake. At the time of its purchase from an anonymous source in the 1980s, the Museum deposited $550,000 in a secret Swiss bank account. This subterfuge alone should have raised suspicions.

That article mentions another artifact reportedly offered to a private collector for a million dollars.

Of course, the trade in such artifacts has been occurring for centuries. In the 1800's there was [Moses Shapira](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Shapira), a Jerusalem antiquities dealer and purveyor of fake Biblical artifacts. 

Of course one can go back many centuries before then as well to find a thriving trade in such artifacts.

&gt;Four cross particles – of ten particles with documentary proofs by Byzantine emperors – from European churches, i.e. Santa Croce in Rome, Notre Dame, Paris, Pisa Cathedral and Florence Cathedral, were microscopically examined. ""The pieces came all together from olive."" It is possible that many alleged pieces of the True Cross are forgeries, created by travelling merchants in the Middle Ages, during which period a thriving trade in manufactured relics existed.

  I'm sure your witty comeback will be something about the crusades, or some whack-a-doo who shoots up a church in Memphis, TN, but that's not the same as anything we're talking about today.
  
  There are old religious sayings, like, ""What you do to one person, you do to the whole world, or if you save one person, you save the whole world.""    That's just insanity on a stick.

  That shit is just ignorant, and baits a world full of pain.  Islam, in it's current mass market effect, is definitely baiting the world for constant aggression.  Islam has a huge glaring problem right now.  Currently, it's manifesting itself, in this century, as being one of the biggest problems to peace and happiness on the globe, similar to the problems of European imperialism in the last century.  Seriously, if you're putting things up on the big board of how planet earth is doing badly, you can point your finger directly at the Middle East and say, ""I'm going to go with 'Crazy Religious shit"" for 300, Alex.""

  What does that have to do with us, in our nice air conditioned homes and HDTVs?  Not much.
  **Saying that all religions of the world are the same invites no measure of effects.**  It paints all people of the world as guilty for the sins of specific individuals, or the past, or whatever.  In short, you kill people, you can't pin it on, ""Well, Christians killed people in the Crusades"" or whatnot.  That's utter bullshit.  Matter of fact, that's a huge and cheap justification for anything.
  I don't take fucking societal cop outs or reflective arguments as a working excuse for fucking mass murder.
  And let's be honest, the religions of the Middle East love them some excuses for mass fucking murder.
  My baptist church didn't peel itself out of service the other day and kill random innocent people.  There isn't a burning sense of lawlessness in my side of the world that says that we should just go round up and execute those that don't believe in what we believe, and that's that.
  Let's all just step back from this bullshit argument of all religions are the same, and just for a second, see this for what it was... it was a racially motivated killing... incited by a religious service.

  I'm sorry I got off on a rant there, but those cheap justifications of ""it's really not the religion that is causing these issues.""
  I burningly disagree... after reading a lot of history books, and seeing a lot of cultures at each others throats, and notice that maybe, just maybe, a religion that uses the word 'Jihad' and constant warfare talk in causal relationships and doctrine all the time can EASILY be contributing to this.
  Look around the world.
  Just because there are a shit ton of peaceful muslims doesn't mean that the religion is peaceful, and it's fundamental ideas aren't absolutely rooted on a domination and constant warfare mentality.

  Most groups, worldwide, don't just up and commit mass murder out of a religious service.  Let's agree to call this one for what it is.

  BTW, good talk.  Hope that gives you something to chew on instead of offending deeply.  Aaaaand...I'm an athiest too.  "

And even so irrelevant since genetic studies disprove this claim. You find one particular allele that says there is some Khazar influence and announce that Ashkenazi are not Jews. Meanwhile Ashkenazi are more closely related genetically to Palestinians than Palestinians are to Saudis. Which means that Palestinians are, by your terms, more Jewish than Arab.

So, anyway, lets actually read your source:

""A good guess is that at roughly the time the Khazar kingdom disappeared, a very small number of closely related individuals with the tradition of being Levi'im, or perhaps only a single male, came from the general region of the Khazar kingdom to join the then-small Ashkenazi community in Europe. ""

And:

""But in the centuries since the beginnings of European Jewry, the best available estimate is that a mere 0.5% of new material entered the gene pool of Ashkenazi Jews in each generation.""

So, yes, irrelevant.

concealer comes in sticks and creams. I used to dig the sticks, but they can end up being greasy and cakey. lately, I've found that cream concealer blends better and doesn't look heavy. I dot it around my eyes (because of my eastern European heritage) and on any other red bumps, pimples.

then for foundation. foundation is kinda a biotch. I usually go for cream in winter and powder in summer - helps counteract the dry/humid weather. for either, I use a typical make-up sponge. I've found that flat circular ones work much better than the triangular ones. then paint. blend everything, being careful not to stop at your jawline - this can create unbecoming lines.

if you want to do eye shadow, go across the lid and then up towards the tip of your eyebrow. generally, I do a lighter shade on my lid, and sometimes highlight the crease with a darker color. blend it all with your fingers until you've got a look you like. I sometimes use the same lighter color just under my brow and near the waterline of my lower lid - I've found these can help brighten up eyes.

I don't usually go for blush, so I can't really explain that :(

eyeliner. I'll use a liquid on my upper lid sometimes and a pencil on my lower lid, but rarely both. lower lid eyeliner can be intense and will make your eyes look smaller. practice makes perfect for the liquid/upper lid. I usually don't tug the lid while applying, just keep it steady and as close to the waterline as possible. my eyes are slightly different - you may want to play around with balancing them out.

mascara's an easy one. after applying, wait a few minutes and repeat.

I usually use a medium pink gloss on my lips. if I need to darken, I'll use brown eyeliner to line my lips, then blend blend blend. but this would be kinda fancy.

I grew up without a maternal figure too, so I had to figure all this out - so you can too. play around with some cheap makeup until you find your ""look"". then invest in some high end stuff - it's worth it.

don't take it too seriously. it can almost be an art project once you get comfortable with it - pretty fun to play around.

one way I counteract dirty nailbeds is to wear polish (usually black or dark red) with a clear coat to prevent it from chipping the first day.

OH! and my huge girl tip lifesaver: get a pumice stone for your feet. I usually take a minute for them while conditioning. you'd be amazed. also feels great on itches :) and removes any other dry skin (not that you should scrub with it, but about once a month, my skin gets flakey. I can nip it in the bud in the shower with the pumice, targeting problematic areas).

please don't ever tan. it's gross and will kill you. let the Jersey Shore girls get the cancer.

hope this helps :) have fun!"

The term American was already in wide use in the US as a nationality and the new independent States didn't really bring any degree of equality between their different races, so Latin Americans continued to differentiate themselves the traditional way, e.g. indian, mulato, métis, european, et c. Hence the ""birth"" of the Latin American by the rulers in Europe who had an interest in taking part of the newly founded states.

The term Latino seems odd not only because it is a spanish word, but also because in spanish it has a different meaning than the one in english (as in Latin related, as opposed to Latin American related)."

The obvious drawback is that you're also emitting NOX and HC (as you point out, based on the design of the engine).  It's a tradeoff.

Yes.  I think it is not accurate to say that it is.  Philosophy and identity issues that surpass the scope of religion are much much more prevalent as problems.

Currently ethnic backgrounds, class struggles between different ethnic groups, old racism and government's despotism are the major sources of tension in the world today.  Even in India, the only place where religious identity and divisions appear most purely ... the corruption from within Pakistan and the memories of recent warfare and class issues, their divisions are what fuel their tensions.

A theocracy is still a government, not a religious practice .. and that's what many people strive for when we say ""Religion will save us!"", often leaving behind many or all tenets of the actual religion.  The American Right has to discount much or all of Jesus' sayings for its current governmental ambitions.

Most religious issues that caused conflict over the centuries have been smoothed over in the name of economics, migrations and interdependency.  That's really what America was created for, due to religious/government corruption and division in Europe.  

Most of the big fights **really** due to religion were internal strife and change (again unsurprisingly related to governance and claims over money/land).

I don't think those on the outside realize how much people in foxholes and in rallies just want an identity... ANY identity... to define why they are angry or hate the enemy.  Largely, people teaching within the churches and mosques just usually are shot/bombed/stabbed when they walk out into the real world... and often by the kings/leaders who wanted them to change their teachings accordingly.

Those who interpret history to focus on ""religion"" as a single entity are actually becoming cultic in recent times, in their own way, to define who their enemies are, finding their identity in that."

You are saying the Koran is a divine miracle because it has these highly subjective properties (pleasing rhythmic system for example), a style and structure not seen before that time, and because you claim that it subjectively can not be reproduced.

No, I'm not. The categories of Arabic aren't subjective.

Rhmyed Prose (Saj)

Normal Speech (Mursal)

16 meters of poetry (16 Bihar)

These are not subjective. Any linguist can make use of them and see how any given text of Arabic fits into those categories. The Qur'an doesn't fit into those categories. The challenge is to see if you can produce something which also does not fit into those categories (the minimum requirements being that it has to be at least several lines and also intelligible).

&gt; i'm pointing out that even if x, y, and z where factually true AND objectively so not subjectively so that would never prove the claims inside the book are true.

This is true. It would only prove that the book was not authored by humans but by something greater (that could either utilize Arabic in ways humans couldn't figure out or could enact miracles). The Arabs of the time thought Muhammad (saw) got it from a demon or lesser deity or something. They too attributed it to supernatural forces.

However, establishing that the book is of non-human origin is significant. I think that's credible grounds by which to put trust in the Messenger who delivered that book (Muhammad (saw)).

&gt; who is defending it? I like parts of it and hate other parts. I like the personal freedoms part (and would like to see more of it).

Unfortunately it's going in the other direction these days.

&gt; it's just funny to me that you keep saying 'oh look it's islam' when it wasn't really islam that was the important factor. It could have been christianity there and it would have done almost as well under the same conditions or a host of other religions. It's this weird rub off association thing you keep doing at every attempt.

This can easily be refuted by looking at the recent history of the West. When the West picked up most of these ideas from the Muslim world which led to the Rennaisance and Enlightenment, and started establishing a new economic system which could sustain rapid and meteoric scientific/technological growth, what happened to the Catholic Church?

The Catholic Church's doctrines were literally forbidding people and holding them back from scientific/technological progress (as well as economic). There was also the fact of their abuse of political power.

First there were the schisms. Protestant Reformation. England, for example, freed itself by making its own Church of England and then went on to take over a good chunk of the planet.

Then came the rise of deism and the rejection of traditional Christian doctrines such as the divinity of Christ and whatnot from Europe's prominent intellectuals which gave rise to modern secular/humanist movements. Most of these people were fine with God, they just didn't like Christianity's take on it.

None of this happened during Islam's heyday. Oh sure there were plenty of huge theological-philosophical fights but both sides in these philosophical fights weren't against science. The philosophy of science was unanimously thought to pose no problems for Islam.

By the way, this trend of thought in Christendom spread to the Muslim world during the colonial period. Many Muslims today sort of behave as the ""Evangelical Protestants"" of Islam, when no such thought existed before their exposure to Europe. It figures... Europe takes beneficial ideas from the Muslim world about Enlightenment and the Muslim world takes backwards ideas from them in turn. /facepalm In our defense, they had little choice when being ruled by all these European cultures.

The problem with the whole ""Protestantism"" movement is that it can become a path to greater liberalism (say, the Church of England which is pretty hands off) or to conservatism, even radicalism/extremism (see: Evangelicals). By opening the door to deviating from the original interpretations, you open the door to both liberalism and conservatism.

European rulers sought to open that door in Islam in order to push liberalism in the political domain, to win the allegiance of the people and destroy any political threat from Islam. That door became pandora's box and all the monsters of 20th century terrorism/extremism came out of it.

That's why I take issue with your deeming of classical Islam as ""liberal"". Ask yourself, by what standard? Compared to Islam today? Surely you'd acknowledge the Islam of the 8th, 9th, 10th centuries was closer to the ""Muhammadan"" ideal (7th century) than what's practiced in the 21st century? That's common sense.

&gt; Islam was not the cause of the economic conditions in the region. Islam was not the cause of the social conditions in the region.

Islam is an economic and social order and anyone who's taken even an undergraduate level course in the study of religion, especially Islam, will know this. There's really no point in furthering this portion of the debate. You're just insisting on opinion while I'm insisting on well established belief/knowledge with substantiation from the Western academic community.

While I don't question the influence of economic and social factors external to Islam on Islam, they didn't completely redirect Islam's own internal philosophy on these matters.

&gt; when the economic conditions changed, the form of Islam being practiced changed also.

As I outlined above, that was more related to political conditions (European colonialism), not economic. 

&gt; There is only one 'form' of evolution. It's the one that is and did happen. The difference is the interpretation and 'extra bits' we tack on or that we get wrong. Objective reality is objective reality no matter if we know it or get it wrong. 

The are two forms in the common understanding, particularly that among those knowledgeable. The evolutionary process we observe (""is"" happening) and the evolutionary process you assumed happened by way of induction (""did"" happen). In case you didn't realize, induction is logically fallacious. We just use it because its useful, but it doesn't establish universal or absolute truths by Western epistemology. So you cannot ever say ""did happen"" and mean that literally and definitively as that would be unprovable.

The evidence we do have for the evolutionary process in earth's history is still not substantial enough to leave the realm of inductive conclusions. The only immediate conclusions that can be drawn from the observable evidence is that the species whose fossils we've found existed in the time and place to where (and when) they were dated/located. I'll be really generous and say we can conclude that evolution happened definitively (though I wouldn't be able to prove it). Muslims, for the most part, do acknowledge all that.

The only part of the evolutionary narrative in the West that Muslims take issue with is regarding the first human. Muslims believe Adam was created in Heaven, then plopped down on Earth in the proper place and time (niche) for humanity. This is not a falsifiable claim. You have no direct evidence of who that was or even if they existed. This narration is taken by Muslims on the Qur'an's authority. An authority established by the previously discussed verifiable miraculous nature indicating its non-human author.

If you want to claim it's the devil or aliens just messing with us, that's your prerogative.

&gt; Fadhel Al-Sa'd a researcher in Iraq of astronomy.
&gt;
&gt; I said this happens in Islamic countries as 'academics' and these people get funding in research in these areas of research.

So you're generalizing from one man to how many? 5 people? 10,000? 1 billion? Even generalizing to one other would be fallacious enough given the circumstances.

&gt; Your average joe of an Islamic country in the third world (or even the developing world) thinks evolution is false, just like the majority of christians in america.

Probably for the same reason. Most of the evolution-rejecters in America are Protestant, specifically Evangelical. Most Muslims have been ruled over by Protestant monarchs (specifically the English who had the most influence... both on America and on the Muslim world) for the last one or two centuries.

&gt; the beliefs themselves **can coexist** in a modern society, **yes**. **compatible, no.**

Definition of compatible:

com·pat·i·ble/kəmˈpatəbəl/

Adjective: (of two things) Able to exist or occur together without conflict.

You're wrong. Compatibility is coexistence.

&gt; The point I was making is that the social structures and actions are westernizing because they work 

Incorrect. They work insofar as much the West established rule over Muslim nations through violent force. That worked, their violence. The social structures were then consequently forced onto the population.

*The West won the world not by the superiority of its ideas or values or religion, but rather by its superiority in applying organized violence. Westerners often forget this fact, non-Westerners never do.*

I know, who doesn't.  No I didn't. The notion that Palestinians are semitic people meaning that they belong to a semitic language group is not racist by any measure. And Jews are not a race, so that's a non starter. 

&gt; According to the story you referenced the contribution is very small. It is not ""none"", it is that you lie to say that Ashkenazi Jews descend from Khazars rather than from Jews from what was and is Israel.

Are you talking about 1030 BCE–930 BCE?
 
&gt;Sorry, but you are not clever. You provided a reference that contradicted your claim.

Sorry, but you are not clever. 

&gt; These studies not only show that almost all Jewish populations have origins in the Middle East, but that the DNA of Jews from almost every corner of the Diaspora is more similar to that of other Jews than to any other population. When compared with non-Jewish groups, the closest match is with the Muslims of Kurdistan, not with the European peoples alongside whom Ashkenazi Jews lived for centuries or the Arab neighbors of many Sephardi populations. ""
And for an extra bonus note that your own reference refers to many studies, not some single study. It is even says why some of them were done, and it was not to say a thing about Khazars.

All people have origins in Africa, they spread around the world through Middle East. So all non-African people have ""origins"" in the Middle East. Most of diaspora Jews Are Ashkenazi and the fact that they now share DNA is not surprising. 

""In an ethnic sense, an Ashkenazi Jew is one whose ancestry can be traced to the Jews of **Central and Eastern Europe**. For roughly a **thousand years**, the Ashkenazim were a reproductively isolated population in Europe, despite living in many countries, with little inflow or outflow from migration, conversion, or intermarriage with other groups, including other Jews. Human geneticists have identified genetic variations that have high frequencies among Ashkenazi Jews, but not in the general European population. ^wikipedia 

&gt; ""But in the centuries since the beginnings of European Jewry, the best available estimate is that a mere 0.5% of new material entered the gene pool of Ashkenazi Jews in each generation.""

No argument there, see **thousand years** above.

I'm not making any claims about the poor Sephardi Jews. No doubt they are the real thing and had to flee all over Europe from Spain turned against them. 

By the way, Kurdistan just happens to be right next to where ancient Khazaria was."

What are you talking about? You don't use JEANS outside of pick up? What about button ups? What about blank t-shirts? What about trousers that one wears with suits? A lot of what I recommended can be worn at the office or at a bar, or in any social setting. Is a white button up+gray trousers really that esoteric?

What about dark wash jeans+button up+cardigan?

You act as if I am recommending something very ""out of the ordinary"" here. These are all clothes REGULAR people wear everyday.

If what I said isn't normal, what exactly do you wear everyday? Graphic t-s cost 30 dollars EACH. While blank tees are usually 6 dollars or so.

If you have a standard 5 graphic t shirts that's already 150 dollars.

Oh, how wrong of me! Forgive me reddit, I did not know the US had a monopoly on civilization! Goodness, without your mighty military and your global sense of justice, the rest of the world would fall apart! Poor slobs we are, not knowing our navels from our buttocks. 

And picking up a new language is so hard! Which reminds me of a joke: what do you call someone who speaks only one language? An American.

Face it. Your rich people / businesses have options the common people do not. For the price of an extra $10,000 a year, I could be enticed to learn any extra language, no matter how much I loathed it. For the money these people might save, it's probably well over $10,000 a year. The average household cannot afford a private tutor to learn French, but I'd wager a typical rich household can easily afford the private tutor and a summer vacation home in France to boot.

What more, your claims that they would not move to a colder climate is countered by the fact that so many of your businesses and rich people live in places such as Washington and New York. These are not warm, sunny places, but then you'd argue that they're surrounded by like people, so it doesn't matter.

Coming to grips with their new surroundings? Most of them have family in Europe, and with the money they have, they visit them more often than you visit the dentist!

The only thing keeping you from realizing the situation you're in is that constant American nationalism: ""Whoooo! We're #1! USA! USA! USA!"", can I ask you, you're #1 in what exactly? Gotta teach the kids while they're young, so they grow up believing it.

Mind you, I'm not asking to suck up to the rich, or fight over the scraps they leave you. What I'm saying is this: level with the rest of the world, synchronize tax codes, and you can close those loopholes! As I outlined above, you can't do it all on your own, though that is a typical American attitude.

In fact, the fucking speedlimits were 85+MPH before the 70's when the oil crisis ""forced"" the government to institute the 55mph limit to ""save gas"". There were cars in the 50's/60's running around on our current highway system at those speeds no problems.

But, when the crisis was over they kept the ridiculously low limit because they fucking made so much goddamn money off of enforcement.

So learn what the fuck you're talking about before making such stupid fucking retarded shit fucking statements as ""cars are not built to take speeds of 85mph"" you fucking dipshit know nothing, diarrhea mouth imbecile.

 If you dont know what the fuck you're talking about, then shut your goddamn fucking cum stained cock hole.

Every source from the period (not European in origin) says he engaged her when she was 6 years old. The only dispute is whether he married and consummated when she was 9 years old or 10 years old.  In other words, pedophile.

&gt;Its understandable to have your view that Islam is somehow a terrorist religion. 

I don't think that.  I have been saying non-stop that Islam does not let you leave it, or criticize it. If I lived in a Muslim country, I could not freely express the thoughts I expressed here without fear for my life.

&gt;You have to look at the deeper picture. Right now it is Christian and Jewish countries occupying and bombing Muslim lands via their overwhelming military prowess. So obviously the desperate attacks of the oppressed will happen an be Muslim.

The murder of 12 UN workers after the burning of the Quran has nothing to do with US occupation or attacks.  It has to do with them being religious fanatics and fucking lunatics.  Nor do the many other attacks on non-Muslims in Muslim countries have anything to do with US occupation.  Why should Coptic Christians be murdered in Egypt?  Why have the few Catholics in Iraq been butchered and forced out of the country?  Why is leaving Islam punishable by death in Afghanistan and Pakistan? Why was a politician who spoke up against an anti-blasphemy law murdered? Why was the only non-Muslim MP in Pakistan murdered? None of this has anything to do with so-called US/Jewish oppression. 

&gt;You don't think the hardcore Christians get off bombing the shit out of countries and supporting the Jews in their ironic occupation? The blood on the US military, arguably a tool of the Christian Empire, far outweighs the rather pathetic ""terrorist"" attacks of the oppressed.

There's so much wrong with this comment I don't know where to start.  There is no ""Christian Empire."" And no, I don't think Christians (or anyone sane) ""get off"" on this stuff. If you want to see people getting off, go watch the video of Daniel Pearl being decapitated.

Because the moment any opinion either way comes about. people have to defend it. people have to hold tight to it. the answer 'we don't know' is very uncomfortable, it's also the right one. But once you have 'magic done it' you get to ignore anything else that comes along.

Actually the proof for the role of God as Creator can be logically deduced but not through traditional ontological or cosmological argument. It has to be an argument for occasionalism, which is the only monotheist theological doctrine that is not only internally logically consistent (eloquently dealing with the problem of causation the West still hasn't gotten past), but can be logically derived from a realist view of the world (as opposed to the pantheist ideologies which can also be internally logically consistent, but aren't realism). That's why the leading philosophers and scientists of the West have turned away from realism for anti-realist philosophies or the Idealism of Kant (and if you're still a realist, you're behind the times and not being very scientific).

The realist naturalism of hacks and ideological demagogues like Dawkins (and many atheists on Reddit who are ignorant of the philosophy of science) is not logically or rationally tenable (outside of Occasionalism) and is outdated in the West.

As I pointed out before, occasionalist theology in the Muslim world goes hand in hand with the epistemological skepticism inherent in the Muslim view of the world (for which I have provided links to papers by Western scholars earlier). In fact, this hitherto unknown doctrine, went on to influence prominent Christians like Malebranche who in turned influenced Occasionalists like Berkeley who in turn strongly influenced the famous European skeptic, David Hume, who more or less motivated Kant to formulate his Idealism upon which modern Western philosophy of science is based.

It seems your biases in your social values (which emphasizes things on the basis of their modernity, meaning ignore history and take whatever is new for the sake of its newness) has colored or fogged your view of history. That's assuming you even have a view of history which is doubtful since your writings here reflect only a perfunctory study of history equivalent to a High School level in the United States.

&gt; &gt; ""If we were arguing over what was on page 205 of Jurassic Park, it's not an appeal to authority to go open a copy of Jurassic Park.""

Another worry that I wouldn't have is that if someone where to claim Dino's didn't actually exist somewhere on the earth at the moment....I wouldn't have to worry about that person trying to demonstrate this being killed.
&gt;
&gt; Research a claim counter to the claims of Islam, and you meet resistance (same with christianity and every other religion when it's been in power might I add).

At this point there is literally no more suitable response than to quote your rambling and quote my own statement above it so if anyone else reads it, they can see what you're doing.

You seem to have no idea what you're doing so I'll tell you. You're basically saying ""It's okay to practice your religion if I like it"" and worse still, ""It's okay to have your beliefs so long as you admit that they are wrong and I am right"".

As a circumcised male, it’s hard for me to say what life would have been like for me, had I remained uncircumcised. Being born in the south, during the mid-80’s, it was pretty much the norm for all males to be circumcised. All the males in my immediate family were circumcised, so it should only seem natural for me to be.

It wasn’t until my family and I moved over to Europe to live for the next ten years, did I see or really understand what an uncircumcised penis was. If I can remember correctly, I must have been about 5 or so and used to play doctor with a neighborhood boy, down the street. I remember being really mesmerized about it, partly because I’d never seen one before and wanted to know why “mine” looked different.

Of course, growing up, going thru puberty and sex ed. We were taught all about both male and female anatomy, and only then did I start understand what “everything” was all about. 

My personal opinion about circumcision is this, you’re the parent and you know what’s best for your child at that point in their lives. Do I wish that I wasn’t circumcised, part of me does, but then part of me doesn’t.  Just because I had it done as a baby, doesn’t mean my sex life has suffered in any way, shape, or form. 

When I have kids, and if they turn out to be boys; I don’t know if I’d get them circumcised, but then again part of me wants to get it done. To the gentlemen who posted this question, I understand what you’re going thru and if it’s still really bothering you, why not talk to your wife or family about it. 

As I stated earlier, I believe that the parent knows what’s best for their child, at that point in their lives. I’m I mad at my parents for getting me circumcised as a baby, no. They did what they think was best, and instead focused on raising me to be an honest, hardworking, productive, member of society. 

The circumcision debate is something that will go on long after I’m dead and gone. I hope this post helps whoever is out there asking these same questions."

There is zero evidence to prove that the part community ownership model results in a club that is 'better run'. Fans always want increased spending, since they are voting to spend money that isn't theirs, while owners make decisions based on their own money. German clubs have as many debt problems as other clubs.

As for youth development, the Bundesliga didn't invent the model. The EPL clubs have all invested millions to produce some of the best academies in the world in the past decade. The pressure from high player transfer costs created natural circumstances where these investments are now feasible and necessary. Previously clubs in Holland, Italy and Spain developed academies because they had to - they either couldn't afford players or were restricted to quotas on how many players they could buy. For eg. in Spain you couldn't buy three 24 year old's from Argentina or Brasil, but you could buy ten 16 year olds and turn them into stars.

As for results, Bayern have won 4 Champions League titles, which is probably below-par considering the size of their revenues and their dominance of one of the biggest football playing nations. Dortmund are the only other German team to have won the Champions League, and they won it once. Germany haven't won the World Cup in 30 years.

Both the Bundesliga and the German national team have benefited from immigration laws. For a player from Eastern Europe or Asia, it is a lot easier to get a work permit to play in the Bundesliga than any other league. These same players, and children of migrants, are also actively scouted and naturalized for the national team - something that a lot of other national teams do not do.

I think this article is nothing more than a publicity campaign by the Bundesliga that has preyed well on the English mood and lack of confidence in anything that is their own. The English media has a habit of framing anything from the continent being by default better than what the English have, and as a way to describe and attempt to 'solve' the problems in the national team (blame the coach, blame the players, blame the league!)

What the spokesperson in this article was also trying to say is that the success of the national team has an increased impact on the value of the television rights of the domestic league. I don't see any evidence of that. Football TV rights in Europe have doubled in value in the past 3-4 years because of increased overall viewship, not because England or Germany are having better world cup campaigns.

To add, the Germans (and Italians) are both likely breaking EU laws on worker rights, freedom of movement and freedom of association, so they probably aren't the best model to hold up for other developing leagues. Everything else should be obvious from other successes - that is, a united negotiating model on TV rights, freedom of player movement and contracts, freedom of ownership, young player development. The Bundesliga only has two of those four."

Much trouble could have been saved if every poetic atheist had said nature rather than god, fuckers.

Newton was a theist, but he also had a bunch of other crazy obsessions. Dude was smart but unhinged, he also lived in a different time period, and so him being a theist is irrelevant to any modern human since we have significantly more information now.

Brian Cox [Link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cox_(physicist), one of the lead guys at CERN is an atheist. The vast majority of member countries working on CERN are majority atheist European countries, so odds are the majority are atheists.

Regardless of all that, I get the feeling you are using this information to make an appeal to authority, which is a logical fallacy.

Even if Einstein was a strident theist, it wouldn't matter. He could still be wrong and he didn't leave behind any evidence that proves a god exists, therefore his personal opinion would be just as valid as anyone else's."

France's electricity imports are negligible, if anything, it is to pretend they comply with European energy trade regulations.


And even then, you need to have a look at who owns the company exporting electricity to France. Like EnBW, in the south west of Germany, which is owned at 48% by EDF....

There are 300+ million people in the US --- what, are only certain chunks of them supposed to get assistance? If so, how is that better off than what we have now?

You can't compare the US to any country in Europe. You just can't. The US is incredibly large compared to others and you can't easily implement a nation-wide, social changing policy is a country with well over a 1/4 of a  billion people compared to UK with 62 million, Germany with 81 million, France with 65 million, Italy with 60 million or dinky countries like Sweden (9 million), Norway (5 million), etc. ---- Hell, look at Greece: It has a mere 11 million people and can barely stay alive economically!

Point is, major, widespread social/economic change increases in challenge, cost, sustainability and likelihood of failure exponentially as population increases. That's why you can't compare a giant superpower like the US (even if it isn't what it used to be) to tiny specks in Europe. Apples and oranges.

Your argument of education being a right would therefore dictate that no education should be beyond the grasp of anyone who wants it. If private colleges were able to exist but public ones were the only ones the masses could attend, all that would happen is that very quickly the education system would change to private colleges being the de-facto standard and public colleges being looked down on. And suddenly you'd have the same situation now, where a certain level of education isn't good enough if you don't have that piece of paper from the right type of establishment.

So yeah - for the US to be ""some Utopia"" you describe, than everyone should have 100% equal access to all educational and medical facilities within the country, no restrictions.

And preemptive knowledge of Pearl Harbor has never ever been established. You must cite something. It's basically the same old libel otherwise.

Sure, propaganda is a weapon both sides can wield. I'm more knowlegable in the latter field, so I will constrain myself to that one:

About the Foreknowledge of Pearl Harbor: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743201299/ (I would also like to include the diary of the US ambassador to Japan between 1932 and '45, Grey, but it has been out of print for a few years). There is tons of incidental proof, however, such as the order to build an 100 carrier two-ocean navy in September 1940, or the fact that to this date not all japanese decrypted messages have been released to the public record because they are considered a threat to ""national security"".

Disclaimer: I have majored in Japanese cultural studies and political sciences. 

&gt; NATO was designed to militarily defeat the USSR. That's gone and many Warsaw Pact countries have joined NATO. I agree NATO doesn't know what NATO's purpose is, but NATO's original purpose is long gone.

NATOs purpose is to stand together if ""troops, an aircraft or a ship of one or more of the undersigned nations gets attacked by a third party in the Mediterrean, the Atlantic Ocean north of the tropic of Capricorn or on its own territory."" This purpose stands till today. This was not the case in both Bosnia nor Libya.

&gt; I'm not saying Germany isn't still a part of NATO, just it's not still a great part of NATO.

And we are more than proud of not taking part in every military the US wants.

&gt;&gt; If the Libyan people are not strong enough to get rid of their leadership by themselves, what right do we have to interfere?

&gt; I think this is irrelevant to the discussion but NATO is close to arming them and I'm sure it won't be Germany.

It is a sad day when we as a pact were to arm one kind insurgents against a dictatorship (Libya) while other very similar insurgents are ignored (Bahrain) or seen as terrorists (Palestine). It says something about our morality, don't you think?

&gt;&gt; It is likely that Gadhaffi will survive this episode, and we really don't want to be the target of libyan-sponsored state terrorism. Lockerbie anyone?

&gt; this is your weakest argument. If your greatest defense against state-sponsored terrorism is to plea ""not me, the other guy!"" then I'm at a loss.

My point is you don't troll an aggressive dog. Europe has lived in peace with Gadhaffi for years, that guy even was more than helpful sometimes. No need to get bitten.

&gt;&gt; Excuse me for not honoring the heroes in the Golden Armors the US troops were back then, according to your thesis. The US, however, pledged MAD not for the sake of Germans, but for the sake of Britain, which would have fallen without a continental stronghold. The NATO plans for Germany were to transform it into a nuclear wasteland as soon as the first soviet tank touched our territory. We were to be destroyed by our American friends, not saved.

&gt; Well you're absolutely right, there. No more germans. It's a shame, cause I love Spaten.

You are right on the technicalities with directive/implementation (I used the original title of the article which mentions ""data retention law"" to make it simpler for people not familiar with intricacies of EU directives etc.)

Though from the ruling itself, the court de facto rejected the policy - *the obligation to store the communication data is cancelled*.

Data that were stored are mentioned in decree [485/2005, paragraph 2](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=cs&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fportal.gov.cz%2Fwps%2Fportal%2F_s.155%2F701%2F.cmd%2Fad%2F.c%2F313%2F.ce%2F10821%2F.p%2F8411%2F_s.155%2F701%3FPC_8411_number1%3D485%2F2005%26PC_8411_p%3D2%26PC_8411_l%3D485%2F2005%26PC_8411_ps%3D10%2310821) (google translate link, but it's quite readable). Section (4) deals with internet - IP, port numbers, URL, result status (means both TCP/IP and HTTP states), amount of traffic, encrypted/unencrypted...

&gt; [...] EU law, which is binding on member states over national laws, including constitutions etc.

Ad the ""over national laws"": in theory true, in practice it's just one huge mess (fresh experience).

&gt; A new law with a similar effect will no doubt be passed by the Czech government in short order.

Iuridicum Remedium, the NGO that pushed for the rejection of the directive, did so since 2005 and they have pretty good track record of overturning stupidities in laws and privacy cases. I'm sure they won't let a new law ""just slip through"" when they spent five years working on the data retention case. We all expected the appeal against data retention fail back in 2005/2006, so I was immensely surprised how far they got (I'm not from IuRe, but I occasionally did some stuff for them).

EDIT: there is a mention of ""reworking"" the Electronic Communications Act, but I don't see how a new law could require ISPs/operator storing the data when constitutional court cancelled the obligation to store the said data.

BTW the plaintext of Czech laws, decrees, etc. is 200 MB and it would be ""funny"" to put it in git repo and see the yearly ""diffs""."

Intuition is an off hand term to refer to that faculty of our mind that produces ""necessary knowledge"" *without our choice in the matter*. The key is necessary knowledge, that's the term that's used all the time in philosophy/theology. This is sometimes called ""immediate perception"", and al-Farabi calls them ""primary principles"" (this term is particular to him and other Islamic philosophers of the Peripatetic/Aristotelian school... because even all Islamic Neoplatonists were really just Aristotelian deep down inside). So, just as the knowledge that 1 + 1 = 2 or that a whole is greater than a part, etc.

Deduction is necessary knowledge which we come to by choice.

So we can see that these early philosophers in trying to reconcile Islamic theology (which was Realist and very pro-induction, empiricism, skepticism) with Greek rationalism first tried to rationalize induction to the level of deduction. And it's not a bad argument. Perhaps induction is just in our nature and we have no choice but to use it? It's subject to greater error than deduction, but we can weed out that error (thus inductive experimental methodology was born... something the Greeks didn't do). So the focus shifted from not justifying induction as some infallible thing, but to things which could lead to errors in induction (skepticism). And that works. I mean, as we know, you don't need to solve the problem of induction to do science. You need to make that leap of faith or take that risk (however you prefer putting it) on induction and then you're like ""well, that wasn't so bad"", and it continues. 

Anyway, it didn't last long. Over time the philosophers who became overly enamored of Greek rationalism split from the Orthodoxy of Islamic theology and became known as the Mutazilah. They decided they liked philosophy better than science, and even religion. Their science was... bad science. Though their philosophy was popular in Europe (where people were getting sick of Christianity) and some of the best Rationalist philosophy around. So they started speculating in theology and tried to conform Islamic theology to their own conclusions (the whole revelation vs. reason debate).

So once they got the attention of the theologians and earned their ire, a Skeptic (as theologians tended to be in Islam) from the developing orthodox theological school of Al-Ash'ari named Al-Ghazali came along who wielded the problems of causation and induction like sledgehammers and single handedly destroyed the Peripatetic school. I wouldn't say he particularly enjoyed it, it was kind of like having to put down your favorite pet who despite being your best friend had unfortunately contracted rabies. :( 

The final form of orthodox theology (the creeds of al-Ash'ari and his theological brother from another mother, al-Maturidi) put induction back into its traditional place in philosophy (not equal to deduction obviously) and found another fix (which came from how they addressed the problem of causation). They also defended their theologies from the Skeptics of other traditions (the Greeks of course and the even trickier Skeptics from India/Persia (Pantheists, man... )). If you want to know more about that, I could cobble together a bit from other posts I've made here and there.

Also, I got the sense from reading some of those later texts that the problem of causation is really a problem of deduction, but I don't know why it's not discussed in Western philosophy like that?"

No, you're not. You're giving examples that are plainly resultant from societal change rather than biological change, and societal pressures are not natural selection. Societal pressures are not selection by a natural environment, they are selection by the environment that humans have created in a directed and artificial manner.

&gt;It makes no difference - it's still evolution by natural selection. If the example of tall people in Holland is confusing you, think about it in terms of male birds being brightly coloured. The brighter they are, the more females select them. Now think about how that plays out with tall men - there is a clear sexual preference for tall men therefore tall genes are naturally selected.

You have not shown that such a preference is not societal rather than biological. In fact, your example of Dutch people growing appreciably taller in just a century contradicts your argument rather than supporting it, and attempting to compare people with birds is weak, because behaviourally they are not comparable.

1. Low interest rates and poor regulation led to one of the largest property bubbles anywhere in history. When Lehman Bros went under, investors in Irish banks got spooked and they couldn't access credit. The banks came to government claiming that they were facing a liquidity crisis, which was serious, but by its nature short term. The government responded by guaranteeing all of the banks' liabilities. It later emerged that the banks were in fact *insolvent* not illiquid and over the ensuing two years €70bn would have to be injected into the banks.

2. During the property boom, the government reduced income taxes and increased spending to win elections. It was able to this because the tax receipts from property transactions were so high. When the bubble burst, this income dried up. This was compounded by the fact that most employment growth between 2002 and 2008 was in the construction sector. As these people lost their jobs they joined the dole queue increasing the government's spending commitment.

The [government's budgetary response](http://www.irisheconomy.ie/index.php/2011/03/22/behaving-like-teenagers/) and the public acceptance of it is, by historical standards, impressive. However, the outstanding sovereign liabilities are now so high that Ireland appears to be entering a debt spiral - the deflation from cutting further and faster will eviscerate the budget surpluses needed to repay our debts.

Corporation tax is only linked to this problem in a very indirect way. The peripheral budget crises in Europe arose because those countries didn't undertake the discipline needed in a monetary union where interest rates are matched to the exigencies of the core countries. Interest rates were extraordinarily low during the last decade because of Germany's economic malaise. Peripheral governments like Ireland and Greece should have dampened demand through taxing and spending. Instead they did the opposite. To prevent this problem afflicting the Eurozone again, the core countries want to harmonise a number of economic policies, among them corporation tax. This, however, will have no effect on the current crisis (at least as far as Ireland in concerned) which will most likely require investors in Irish banks to take a hit for investing in reckless institutions.

I'm uncertain about how much sense the harmonisation of a corporate tax base, or tax rates, makes. I know the motives behind them aren't the most rational - in Ireland the 12.5% rate has become a sacred cow and in Germany and France attacking it is a useful way to impress voters angry about bailing out insolvent sovereigns. In reality, Ireland budget problems are totally unrelated to corporation tax (it makes up a greater share of government revenue than the [EU average](http://www.ronanlyons.com/2010/11/16/and-its-hard-to-craft-a-budget-when-youre-watched-by-olli-rehn-open-letter-to-soon-to-be-european-overlords/).) Ireland is also unusual in that its average corporation tax rate (after loopholes and exceptions) is very close to its headline rate (about 11%) In contrast there is a difference of about 25 percentage points between [France's](http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2011/0323/1224292848181.html) average and headline rates. Ireland also lacks easy access to large ports and European transport routes. This makes it heavily reliant on services and high value manufacturing, which are notoriously footloose. In attracting these MNCs Ireland is competing as much with jurisdictions like Switzerland, Israel and Singapore as Germany and France.

Ireland tax rate obviously does bestow it with a competitive advantage, and [some MNCs](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39784907/ns/business-bloomberg_businessweek/) do abuse it, but on the whole I think its a legitimate and necessary economic strategy with benefits for Ireland and the EU."

We fought the war as if it was the war the US military was preparing to fight the Russians, and by those metrics we did great. And If you're going to chastise the US for their mistakes, you may as well point out the Russians in the 80s, and the Brits in the 1800s I think, had the same problem in Afghanistan.)

In 1975, Army Col. Harry Summers went to Hanoi as chief of the U.S. delegation's negotiation team for the four-party military talks that followed the collapse of the South Vietnamese government. While there, he spent some time chatting with his North Vietnamese counterpart, Col. Tu, an old soldier who had fought against the United States and lived to tell his tale. With a tinge of bitterness about the war's outcome, Summers told Tu, ""You know, you never defeated us on the battlefield."" Tu replied, in a phrase that perfectly captured the American misunderstanding of the Vietnam War, ""That may be so, but it is also irrelevant.""

In layman terms when the US imports more than it exports, it means investors from other countries have to buy US assets to keep the dollar from falling. In other words if the US imports more than it exports, foreign investors must buy dollar-denominated assets like bonds or treasury securities in order to offset the difference.

Economic theory is very simple. Demand increases value. For example, ""if French investors saw an opportunity in the U.S., they might be willing to pay more euros in order to get dollars to invest in the U.S."" More euros per dollar means the dollars value has risen.

There is a large amount of demand for dollars because most countries accept dollars as currency when buying from other nations. If you are China and you buy a million barrels of petroleum from Saudi Arabia you will be paying with US dollars. The amount of world trade around the world is mostly done in the reserve currency which means the demand for dollars is enormous despite the increasing circulation.

At the moment thanks to Chinas investment the US is being supported but that won't last forever. A lot of trade between nations is being switched to different currencies. The Chinese and Russians do trade with each other without the help of the US dollar. As trade grows between Asia and Europe soon both continents will bypass the dollar.

It largely hinges on China though. China buy and sell trillions of dollars of things every year. If they dumped the currency the circulation would outweigh the demand and that would have a drastic effect on the dollar. Basically you may need a hundred dollars to buy a can of beans depending on the circulation.

At the moment though China are creating enormous amounts of demand for the US dollar. Even the oil they buy brings in hundreds of billions and is all traded in the US dollar. If they stopped supporting the US dollar?

Well you know all those ridiclous doomsday theories everybody has? Well if that did happen those theories would not be so ridiculous anymore. If the dollar was dumped it would effectively cripple the US.

The world currency being dropped is just about the worst case scenario for the US. I mean it can't get much worse than that. Look up Zimbabwe to see what happens with hyper inflation and when circulation is much higher than demand."

The problem is the debt is accelerating and the deficit will only grow. It's funny because China on the one hand is rescuing the US but on the other hand over the long term China is killing the US.

During the 60's America had a huge advantage because due to World War 2 all the infrastructure in Europe was destroyed and the US had an opportunity to trade with the world. The world was buying more from the US than the US was buying from the rest of the world.

What happened was the US economy started increasing its own cash reserves while Europe was being leeched dry. The US would then give money to Europe and charge them interest. So the US was making a fortune through a deficit and then making money through interest too.

This is kind of the same situation except it is much much bigger and it is at a much worse time. The US needs to find a way to compete with China on trade volume and not let China capture the European market.

At the moment nearly everything in Europe is made in China. I mean from motherboards to computer mouses, tea cups and numerous other things. China's trade is growing and Europes money is going to China. There is less demand for US products which means factories are closing and numerous job postings are disappearing.

It's a shitty position to be in because the US hasn't got the money to invest in infrastructure on a large scale and there is no real demand for many of those products in the first place.

Cheap labour is only a temporary problem(though certainly one). Infrastructure is really really really really expensive. Building a big infrastructure is extremely fucking expensive.

P.S. Did I mention infrastructure is expensive? Seriously most countries have plenty of workers and most countries have cheap labour its just so expensive to get the infrastructure built for millions of workers."

In fact, class mobility in those countries is HIGHER than the US, where business is much less regulated, and taxes are much lower.  It's easier to achieve the American Dream in Sweden than it is in the U.S.

What you say is kind of correct but mostly by accident.

Ireland and UK have an immigration/customs agreement which is separate from the Schengen agreement governing travel in much of mainland Europe.

There is no such thing as ""EU customs"". And the reason the flight from Ireland to UK will not involve passport control has nothing to do with the EU. The UK/Ireland situation predates Schengen by many years.

When she travels from the UK to mainland Europe, she will have to go through passport control and get a new stamp.

An American gets 180 days to stay in the UK and Ireland. These days don't count against the 90 days she'll get in the Schengen area. She could, for example, spend 180 days in the UK, then spend 90 days in France/Spain/Italy/whatever, then spend another 180 days in the UK.

However, after 90 days in the Schengen area, she will need to stay away for 90 days before she can return, unless she gets a visa at a Schengen country's consulate."

Not true, all you have to do is look at all the major Islamic scientists of that era and you'll discover that they were also Islamic scholars. A good brief history on this subject could be found in Karen Armstrong's book, A Brief History of Islam.

One of the main reasons why the study of the sciences stopped could be traced to two major events. The Mongol invasion of Muslim lands (this includes the sacking of Baghdad as you mentioned) and the attack on Granada and the eventual conquest of Spain by the Spaniards from the Muslim. Seeing that Muslim texts were seen as herectical, major libraries were burned and scholars were killed.

This eventually lead to the reevaluation of Islamic governance in most Muslim countries, switching from an agrarian society to an Imperial one, such as that under the Ottoman, Safavid, and the Mughal Empires. These Empires spent most of their time investing money in military might, developing arms, and shaping their empires after the Mongols (the Safavids are distant relatives of the Mongols and the Mughals claimed to be descendants of the Mongol hordes). The main objective of these empires was not making sceintific discoveries, but rather military enhancements.

Patronage for the sciences stopped, and eventually Europe began where the Muslims left off. The Ottomans were never able to recover from this militrization. In fact, while Europe was advanding in the sciences, the Ottomans felt it was time to reform along European standards and instead of adopting the sciences, they adopted European military institutions, structuring their armies according to European standards. Also, whether we like to admit it or not, but military defeats against the Europeans lead to imperialism which really dampened any progress in the Muslim world. The Europeans delibirately kept the spread of Islamic isntitutions of knowledge under caps(which is actually one of the reasons why so many Muslims are ignorant about their own faith today since they have outdated institutions). There were several universities throughout the Muslim world before the arrival of Europeans, but that changed significantly after the Europeans shut them down effectively, which is why you have so many ""new"" institutions that started opening up around the mid 1800s when some restrictions were lifted.

I have always posted like this and slowly but surely my karma did rise. I don't try to hide who I am and how I act and I for damn sure don't plan to change myself to please reddit. 

I'm not trying to be kleinbl00 or sad_scientist or blackstar, I just enjoy being myself and posting my thoughts. 

I guess it is the ADD nature of the youth my age that I can't focus on a topic for longer than 3 lines. 


I have been coming here for 4.5 years, have had an account for 3, I have been commenting for 10 months and have made it to the top of the comment karma pyramid. You know what that is worth? Nothing. Karma is a pissing contest that matters to the same people that hope to be best-ofd.

Would I change anything about my time here? No.


These are two random selections of 1000 of my comments. 

The[ first](http://i.imgur.com/2NePw.png) is before anyone knew my name and the[ second](http://i.imgur.com/rWOnO.png) is after. 


In the beginning I never left askreddit because I believed and still do believe that it is the best community. I am pretty good friends with many of the redditors that I spend time with there (At least 10 are my facebook friends that often comment and talk to each other).

Once people started to notice how much I comment, people started to take offence at me and I got in a few fights and ended up branching out. 

I still get 1/3rd downvotes, still type nearly the same length and still do all my redditing from around the same times. Only now I comment less on this account.

Anything that increases infection rates is a gain to them, thus attaching ad-ware to fake antivirus suites or making believable popup menus to click on is a great way to achieve that. The antivirus companies are constantly trying to keep up with this. It's in their best interest to succeed as well to keep their profits flowing.

Your idea that there is a conspiracy theory is along the lines of the government supporting and perhaps actively developing lethal viruses or bacterial infections to keep people sick and taking medication. Some people believe that but it just doesn't really make any sense.

P.S. There are only handful of reputable antivirus companies and ad-ware companies.  E.g. Norton, McAfee, AVG, Avast, Panda, etc. A few of these have FREE versions for single license users, thus eliminating incentives to create more viruses. Think of it this way, if you're going to invest time and effort to make something and some other company is just going to try to fix it, do you have any incentive to actually go through with it?

I'm saying that I don't believe genetic adaptation is responsible for an increase in height Holland in the last 100 years. I think increased access to nutrition is responsible for that. Increased access to nutrition does not lead to passing on taller genes to your children, it simply allows a species capable of taller heights to reach that capability. 

There hasn't been anything in any of your links to disprove that. If anything they have shown just the [opposite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_height#Determinants_of_growth_and_height): 

&gt;Attributed as a significant reason for the trend of increasing height in parts of Europe are the egalitarian populations where proper medical care and adequate nutrition are relatively equally distributed. Changes in diet (nutrition) and a general rise in quality of health care and standard of living are the cited factors in the Asian populations. Average height in the United States has remained essentially stagnant since the 1950s even as the racial and ethnic background of residents has shifted. Severe malnutrition is known to cause stunted growth in North Korean, portions of African, certain historical European, and other populations.

""Tall people have tall children"" is a tautology. That doesn't say that height increasing in a 100 year timespan is a result of genetic selection. Although you haven't outright stated it, I think we can accept as a fact that access to nutrition does not alter your DNA in a way that makes your children even taller then you were. "

Secondly, where did I talk about comparing ourselves to anyone? I simply said, there is no reason to change our culture or lifestyles to try and become something else. If the Chinese want to do that, then let them. 

This is about what is actually going on. Sure the article talks about how the Chinese have topped the world in academic-style testing. It also fails to mention the variety of negative attributes China carries, including the methodology of its schooling.

China, like the former Soviet Union, imposes math and science on its children as much as they elect to study it. Whether or not this is good, can be debated, but the lack of choices available in Chinese schools is far from the norm in Western culture. It's also interesting to note the lack of creativity provided or allowed in their public school systems. This translates into poor decision-making or problem-solving in the business arena. I was just in Beijing and was warned prior about this and it was astonishing how prevalent it is. I suspect this is the reason you see so much copyright infringement and IP theft. 

As for the recent studies, they only visited the best parts of Shanghai, the most Westernized city in China (sans Hong Kong). When you take the entire education system as a whole, it has just as many holes and flaws as that in the US. This is why you see all of the Ex-Pats from the US, Europe, Australia, etc. send their children to private, ""Western"" schools instead of Chinese public institutions. 

Alas, what ""lunch"" exactly have the Chinese come for? The unskilled labor's ""lunch"", maybe? As the Yuan continues to appreciate against the USD (which poses many cons for the US), I am interested to see how China will adapt and if it can become an innovative nation like South Korea.

Along with all of these various issues, if you venture around China, you quickly realize some of the crucial issues that will really set the country back someday. The most notable is the obvious demographic shift or shock that will occur due to the ""one child"" policy, which oh by the way, is still in place. Abortions of female fetuses is still very common, as is female adoptions (i.e. exportation of females to other nations that will likely stay in the countries they grow up). 

There is also the lack of freedom that the Chinese lack. I was unable to go on Facebook or Google products unless I used a specialized VPN routed through LA, which of course was shut down as well. Can you imagine? 

For all of the media hype, I have more faith in South Korea and India as two of the leading nations of the future. China is a bubble economy, fueled by a massive population. We shall see how sustainable this will be."

&gt; Meanwhile, the 2005 report of the IAEA-dominated Chernobyl Forum, which estimates a total death toll from the accident of only several thousand, is widely regarded as a whitewash as it ignores a host of peer-reviewed epidemiological studies indicating far higher mortality and widespread genomic damage.

So, a relatively respected international organization publishes a paper that is ""widely regarded as a whitewash,"" but the author can't find anyone credible to go on the record with a quote? He can't dig up any papers by credible scientists to support the ""widely regarded"" opinion?

The rest of the article is very similar. E.g.,

It appears to me that culture accounts for a larger part of the difference and yes, there are huge cultural and social differences between US and Europe.  I wasn't trying to dodge the question, I just assumed it was implied.

Look at what happens with gun violence when you have strict gun control in the US. Nothing! Violence stays high. So it seems that there is something else driving the violence up. Look at what happens in Europe when you have no gun control: the murder rates are similar to the countries that have the strictest laws.

And you don't need to mock Brazil, we *are* enough of a mockery of a country already. I have not the slightest doubt that we are indeed uncivilized. And I am inclined to think that any country with such high gun death rates is uncivilized also. If you look at gun deaths in Britain before the gun control became strict, they are nowhere near american rates.

But these are just assumptions, I have no idea what is the real source of gun violence in the U.S. But I am not the one claiming that I know it, you are. The burden of evidence is yours, not mine.

I suffered anti-Irish abuse while living in London and was seen as slightly above the ""Gastarbeiters"" in Berlin because I am white and Irish.

My point was that I had worked as an architect, and yes, I made a shite load of money in each of the three cities which were booming and then collapsed.

I don't feel that I was lecturing anybody, just throwing in my Tuppence Ha'penny as a forced emigrant from the bad old days. When I graduated in '94 I really wanted to stay in Ireland but after sending out 130 CVs I only got one interview for a three month contract. I didn't get the job and a few months later I landed a job doing a traffic survey in Dundrum for an engineering company. With the money I earned from that shitty job I emigrated to Berlin where I got a job as an architect within three weeks of arriving.

Again I will stress my point that the Celtic Tiger was unsustainable, people foolishly got swept up in it and are now paying the bitter bitter price.

Case in point: I was on the team for the Dundalk Xerox campus design. The brief the company I worked for was that each of the campus buildings could have a potential 100% expansion in square meters and also could have multi-use potential for future development. The only exception was the toner building which was a highly specialised construction. Xerox were coaxed to set up operations in Dundalk by the low corporate tax rates and the educated workforce. Xerox moved from the Netherlands to Dundalk, the Dutch were livid. For Dundalk it was a godsend, people thought they had jobs for life and mortgaged themselves heavily on the strength of that. Dormitory housing estates were built without the proper community infrastructure. Recipe for social disaster.

Where is Xerox now? Off in some Eastern European country after their brief low corporate tax sojourn in Ireland. Ireland got raped by the multinationals, who went there to earn a quick buck or not to pay as much corporate tax as elsewhere. Haughey set it up and fair play to his corrupt/criminal soul he brought Ireland into the modern business age."

I think it's as much tradition as it is a rule, but it is definitely a rule. Ferrari keep pushing for 3 drivers per team, but that's probably not gonna happen. The car is already made, so it makes sense to add a 2nd driver, but with a 3rd driver you start to need a lot of mechanics, the grid gets crowded, and its just another expense for a struggling team.

2.  Depends on where you go. I think Hungaroring, which is normally empty, is like $150 for the entire weekend, whereas Monaco is $300+ for the weekend, with the shittiest seats you can get. If you are in the US, the ticket price probably doesn't matter much after your flight to Europe. Don't know how much cheaper a flight to Brazil is, but that might make the most sense, especially with how good the racing is there. formula1.com has the prices on their site.

Anyways.  I better reason not to is because the most sensitive part on his body, where the frenulum attaches the rigid band and foreskin to the glans, will be severed and form scar tissue.  Go and watch some POV porn or fap it and look on the bottom of your cock head.  If you are cut you will see a tiny or large scar depending on the type of device used.  This is basically the male clit or gspot.  

The way I look at it is to realize that the frenulum is one of the richest bundles of nerves on the penis.  Just like the cilt is on women.  While the rigid band, a separate part of the foreskin with more nerves than the rest of the skin, is more like the clitoral hood and the foreskin is more like the labia.  I know it is difficult for many people to understand because medical books are woefully lacking in this area and many want to compare to glans or cock head to the clit but this is a false analogy if you look at the number of nerve ending in both.

The glans has about half the number of nerve endings as the clit does but you need to realize that the bundle of nerves in the clit actually extends inside the vagina.  Next time you are with your girl, take your fingers, index and middle, with your palm up and her on her back, and insert them and do a come hither motion and press against the upper inside part of her vagina behind the clit.  It will feel different than the rest of the inside of her, and it varies between women, but this clump of nerves connects to the clit and is called the gspot.  

I did a lot of personal and academic research into this and I also have the benefit of having a father who used to work as a gynocologist and I learned to draw from reading medical books as a kid...he isn't a doctor any more because he got sued by some white trash but that is a different story.  

Have you ever seen the feminist pro sex arguments that goes like this:

1. Women have x amount of nerves in their clit.

2. Men have y number of nerves in the glans/cock head.

3. x is greater than y by 50%

4.  Haha, women can have multiple orgasms and men can't...lulz, women are better than men.

This is not the full picture but I have seen it on Oprahs website and even in classes.  If you take the number of nerve endings in the foresking + number in frenulum + number in rigid band + number in glans it = the number in clit +clit hood+gspot + labia....with shaft = to the internal walls of the vagiiiiiina.

I will admit that I am uncut and I have hiked the Sinai mountains more than once and not showered for weeks and this was before I could drive cause I lived with my single mom overseas in Egypt as a teen....I never had any problems.  I do remember readin more than one survival story where a group of guys were out in the arctic and got severe frost bite on their toes and fingers and even their dick...they all had to have parts amputated except one guy didn't get it on the dick...he was uncut.  It serves more purposes than to gross out females.  

Unfortunately it is ultimately your choice but if you are going to make it then please do some research and make sure it is fully informed.  

I will say this.  As a uncut guy I can have multiple orgasms.  Orgasm != ejaculation.  They are actually two different processes in the body.  I have seen one or two studies and plenty of anecdotal evidence that uncut guys have higher sex drives.  This may not, to be truthful, have anything to do with having foreskin but may have more to do with having to get over more hang ups sexually when we come of age...girls like confidence.  Then again, haven't you ever wondered why American women are so obsessed with european men?  I remember the last time I was in Israel I was hitting on some bitches and they kept asking about whether or not I was cut and whether I would get cut.  Apparently a lot of Israeli women, especially in the more liberal Tel Aviv, want to know what the other side feels like before getting arranged marriages or settling down with a nice traditional Jewish man....this is one problem in the area, because many go after palestinian men for sexual experiences and ofcourse this creates male-male competition and jealousy which exacerbates the political tensions....and..have a upboat."

Some questions:

* Is the qur'an really meant to be taken literally?
* If two passages contradict each other,  the one writen later really supersedes the older ones?
* Striving to institute worldwide Shari'a law is really a *religious duty*?
* Is true that in the quran Democracy and free speach are abominations and must be eliminated?
* Attemps to introduce the shari'a law in legal systems of Europe?
* Shari'a law is the word of allah and any other form of government is a sin?

The word 'conspiracy' has this discourse nowadays which implies that the conspiracy is not true; Fritz Fischer's    account of *Germany's aims in the First World War* is factual.

 &gt;Griff nach der Weltmacht: Die Kriegzielpolitik des kaiserlichen Deutschland 1914–1918 (published in English as Germany's Aims in the First World War), in which he argued that Germany had deliberately instigated the First World War in an attempt to become a world power.[1] In this book, which was primarily concerned with the role played in the formation of German foreign policy by domestic pressure groups, Fischer argued that various pressure groups within German society had ambitions for aggressive imperialist policy in Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East.[1] In Fischer's opinion, the ""September Program"" of September 1914 calling for the annexation of most of Europe and Africa was an attempt at compromise between the various demands of the lobbying groups within German society for wide-ranging territorial expansion.[1] Fischer argued that the German government deliberately and consciously used the crisis occasioned by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in the summer of 1914 to execute already preformulated plans for a war against France and Russia in order to create Mitteleuropa, a German-dominated Europe and Mittelafrika, a German-dominated Africa.[8] Though Fischer argued that the German government did not want a war with Britain at that moment, they were fully prepared to run the risk in pursuit of Mitteleuropa and Mittelafrika.[8]

&gt;The book was preceded by Fischer's groundbreaking 1959 article in the Historische Zeitschrift in which he first published the arguments that he expanded upon in his 1961 book. In The Shield of Achilles: War, Peace, and the Course of History, Philip Bobbitt has written that after Fischer published it became, ""impossible to maintain"" that World War I had been some sort of ""ghastly mistake"" rather than a deliberate and intentional German policy.[9]

&gt;For most Germans, it was acceptable to believe that Germany had caused World War Two, but not World War One, which was still widely regarded as a war forced upon Germany by its encircling enemies. Fischer was the first German historian to publish documents showing that the German chancellor Dr. Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg had developed plans in 1914 to annex all of Belgium, part of France and part of European Russia.[1] Fischer suggested that there was continuity in German foreign policy from 1900 to the Second World War, implying that Germany was responsible for both world wars. 


* NATO gave the Serbs a knowingly unacceptable ultimatum prior to the '99 Kosovo intervention. A little ironic considering Austria's 1914 calculatedly unacceptable ultimatum to the Serbs. [Check it out for yourselves](http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/ramb.htm) with special attention to Appendix B--which was added only the day before and was not included in the copy given to Russia, the Serb ally at the Rambouillet conference. Chapter 4a is also rather interesting.

If you like that, it is a hell of a lot fun (unless you are ridicilously overgeared, then it's a ""blast"". As in ""blast through everything godstyle). It ""wants"" you to rush though, and be efficient in the maps by providing better chance on better loot for beating the timelimit, and clearing all monsters/obiliscs.
And you can see how the ""we won't drop you healtpotions, but the enemies will drop ""instant pickup"" baubles"" system Diablo3 proposes works.

2. The editor: Boring if alone, hillarious when in voice. Sadly lacks the ability to show of your chars outside the maps, other than with their thumbnail system, or external screenshots.  
Enjoyment clearly dependend on your level of personal creative output. Working AGAINST the limitations, and for instance ALWAYS missplacing obvious things to wrong places can result in hillarious monsters.  
Also : hit A for removing the ""symetric"" conditions on items yields other hillarious effects. (Got somehting that looks like a shield? Maybe convert it into a cowboy hat. Got a root that looks silly? Dont hide it small on the back, either provide your char with a horses dong, or complement your cowboy hat with a cigar/pipe, add ""satchel on the side and girdles looking like ammo girdles : instant cowboy.

3. Story/level setup   
Nonexistant. This is the endresult if you watch blizzard casualise WOW, or would have skipped on Diablo2s ""continuous map + port-stones"" feature.
It is ""dirty"" map - results - map -results grinding in 10-15 minute portions (10 for goldmedal). But at least you can ""segment"" your playtime well that way. There is a try of hinting at a global war, but watching a vid while your party waits, or not rushing the timelimit to stop and listen to the muck the female voice says? Not really happening. And the wild porting between planets for no bvious reasons doesn't create a world, but rather an inconsequential backdrop for the grindfest, basicly directly skipping to the ""mephisto run"" phase of D2

4. Bad learning curve. To easy to soon, to many options very fast. ~1 hour in, and you have more heroes abilities and junkitems than to properly disect, and it is only when focusing on ""tried and tested"" ignoring other stuff, that it will feel a bit less daunting (but repetetive at the same time)

5. Conclusion: 
It lacks a lot of obvious features. The interaction between the editor and the shop is not well thought through. It lets you SELL items from the editor, but not convert items to details (removing the stats but creating a cosmetic item), which makes for excessive entering and exiting both screens.
If they get a good feel for threatlevels, (which you can ""test"" if you undergear a level for kicks) it looks like !THE! decent Diablo clone of the last years, if only gameplaywise, and it feels like almost a ripoff of what Diablo3 is going to be, sans ""world/story/continous feel"" but + a hilarious way to actually have individual heros blatantly not looking like anyones. I know my brothers heroes look nothing like mine.

6. Pricetag: 50€?  REALLY EA? You aren't Blizzard. And this doesn't look on par with Diablo 3 for what the differences truelly are. And you reused a good part of another games engine, which is fine, but should show in the price tag. I know the Euro has grown strong lately, and you want a converted amount of $ for your efforts, but the ""normal"" people in europe (as in wasting their time on videogames instead of joining a Yacht club) don't have more ""money"" than before.

Tl:dr. If you are into diablo for the fighting and looting, Darkspore is very fun. It has enough underlying complexity to keep you busy, even to the extend of being overwhelming at times (if you want to play right, and not just ""win"".)
It is by far not a mediocre game, if you like what they are actually trying to do. THe editor certainly sets it apart from games where the differences in characters is either mechainsitic only, or superficial visually at best."

&gt; Is the qur'an really meant to be taken literally?

Some of it yes. Some verses are not. See Quran 3:7 you need to read the whole Quran to find out.



&gt; If two passages contradict each other, the one writen later really supersedes the older ones?

That's the abrogation principle which is agreed upon by most of the community. See Quran 2:106



&gt; Striving to institute worldwide Shari'a law is really a religious duty?

No. Only the fundamentalists think that way.



&gt; Is true that in the quran Democracy and free speach are abominations and must be eliminated?

No. Not explicitly. 



&gt; Attemps to introduce the shari'a law in legal systems of Europe?

I don't live in Europe. So I cannot answer that. 



&gt; Shari'a law is the word of allah and any other form of government is a sin?

Sharia law is the compilation of Quran and Hadith law and judgements as they are interpreted. And no, governments are not a sin systematically. 



&gt; Is it the duty of every muslim to keep striving until all governments have been converted to shari'a law?

Again, NO. Only the fundamentalists think it is.




&gt; Are muslims allowed to deceive non-muslims if it helps islam?

This is overhyped. Even if it exists, it's not that spread AFAIK. 



&gt; All non-muslims living in non-islamic states are enemies?

The **most extremist of the fundies** think that way. The vast majority of moderate Muslims don't. 



&gt; Deceiving westerners is encouraged if it can forward the goals of the spread of islam?

Already answered. I'll go even a step further and say that many mulims don't know what so-called taqqiyah really is.




&gt; Was the Islamic American Relief Agency giving money to terrorists?

Ok, thats enough, by you, the UK is the worst religious place in Europe. You don't have a clue about Europe. 

&gt;Your whole argument around ""Hungary is not worse than other EU countries"" is not serious argument.

Since the media law and the new constitution are being attacked by foreign, EU politicians, like the Cohn-Bendit fellow, this argument is the only that counts. If you want to fuck up Hungary, because it mentions God in its constitution, then please first go and fuck with some bigger country first, like the UK. Or if you don't like our media law, then go on and object the French and German media laws, let *them* defend it, since we took most parts of the law from them. 

The EU socialist-liberals just want to mess into Hungarian internal politics, if these issues were even true issues, they should have fight for them in their own countries first. Its like Cohn-Bendit is saying: ""I'm a French liberal, who can't do shit in my own country, but would like to have Hungary punished, for not being liberal enough for my taste.""

The bank bailouts were much needed to save us from suffering a Depression. Bush, Bernanke, and Obama did a remarkable job with this one. 

&gt;props up the military industrial complex with it's endless wars

Again with this ""endless wars"" shit. Wars have been going on since the beginning of time.  The USA is the most powerful country in the history of the world and has chosen to use its power to influence global affairs. It's not a conspiracy.

&gt;props up the prison industrial complex with it's endless wars on substances

Stop doing drugs then. Do you really need pot to live a happy life? Pathetic. The potheads have been winning, anyways, so this conspiracy that doesn't exist is losing. If you want heroin and cocaine to be legal drugs then you lost me. 

&gt;props up the media cartels with the endless extensions on IP

IP version 6 is a conspiracy now? OK... 

&gt;Dude, why did the government pay the railroad barrons over 2 million inflation adjusted dollars per mile of track laid, and why is the railroad industry stagnant in the USA today, even though it thrives in Europe where that didn't happen as much?

Freight railroads are still huge here in the USA. The passenger railroad industry isn't as big in the US as it is in Europe because the environment is different here. Europe is much more densely populated, for one. The Federal Government invested heavily in roads through Eisenhower's Interstate Highway Program. Is Ike part of the conspiracy too? I'm sure lobbyists from companies like Ford and GM worked to make sure that roads were the preferred method of travel, but again, it makes sense that roads are what we have here. The US is more spread out and more newly developed compared to Europe. Rails are fixed and restrictive, roads are made more sense from a logistical point of view and also made us more free than rails would! BTW, I'm in favor of Obama's high speed rail proposal but think that it's still too modest. 

&gt;Anybody can see how the public education system is going to hell and it gets worse and worse every year, yet the money paid into it has gone up every year. Check it out. It's a fact. Do you believe in empirical observation, or not?

The public education system gets more expensive because of many factors including, but not limited to, union wages and benefits and special education. A great visionary, George W Bush sought to change the US educational system and put its K-12 system on a path to be more like the University system, which is the envy of the world. No Child Left Behind simply paves the way for a voucher program. Unfortunately lobbyists and a sorry bunch of elected officials in Congress prevented school choice from ever happening.

I'm not in any sort of mental prison. The USA is a great country and I would love to give a big middle finger to Cultists like yourself who hate it. Next time I'm enjoying my frequent flyer benefits in the Delta Skylounge while on the way to Southeast Asia I'll think of pathetic individuals like you who go on and on and on about how much of a ""prison"" we are in here. There are only so many nice places in the world and the USA is one of them, and it its in fact the undisputed leader of this free and prosperous world! 

Off in the third world there are millions of people who are free to do business under the table, without fear of the Jewish -- I mean government regulators to get in their way. This is because their country is so weak and corrupt there is no enforcement of rules that are in reality much more restrictive than what we have in the US. The same is true for things like drugs and prostitutes! On the way back from the world-famous Banaue Rice Terraces in Ifugao Province I hopped on a van from Solano, Philippines to Baguio City, Philippines to take the journey through the winding mountain roads. This one girl on my row had been trying to go to the USA for three years. She has two preferred cities, Washington DC and Chicago, but the process has proven to be unbeleivably hard. She works as a nurse in Baguio City and her family is in that town of Solano. The pay really is nothing, which is a damned shame since she seems like such a bright and hard-working girl. I'm assuming that you are from the USA, argoff. It's too bad you can't trade places with people like that. You have no idea how good you have it, and have managed to delude yourself into thinking that you are living in some sort of tyranical society when the reality is that the modern western civlization that you live in is the most advanced, most free, and most prosperous society in all of history! 

GTFO of my country, argoff!

Who knows what will happen in 20 years it's pointless to talk about.

In a country the size of America there are few limits when it comes to talent, but it's something that needs heavy work. If England can support a four-tier professional system then the US can certainly manage two.

While I agree that it's hard to state what will happen in twenty years MLS will have had a long-term plan set out and I bet that will reach out for ten years at the very least. With many of the top leagues expressing an interest in setting up academies in the US to help with issues like work permits for transfers and producing top-quality American talent it's certainly something that needs to be thought about in the long-term because the right long-term decisions will dictate what direction the league turns to, towards the transfer market and bringing in talent or towards producing talent from America and acting as its own market.

&gt; I don't think MLS needs a promotion/relegation system, but I do think it would be enjoyable to watch.

This is what America really needs, and this is why I think it is 100% guaranteed to happen in the long-term future of MLS. Sports fans often talk of discontent with American sports and the World Cup showed that America can truly support football at its highest level. Club football is something that Americans need to support and at the moment MLS has trying to play the likes of the NFL and MLB at a game they've been playing and building for decades. It's just not going to work in the long-term and MLS will simply die out if it doesn't continue to grow with the footballing world.

It won't be long until MLS has filled out its two conferences, and from that position the only changes left to make are in regards to the league itself. If the USA had landed the World Cup over Qatar then I would believe that promotion and relegation were ten years away, and I still believe that one of the incentives to FIFA for America getting the World Cup on the next bid will definitely be the further development of MLS as a league.

&gt; The average American sports fan is fearful enough of anything European, that i would be happy with 1 successful soccer league that is regularly played on tv.

Promotion and Relegation are not European. They're adopted all around the world, from Japan to Egypt to Brazil. This is yet another reason why America will adopt the system sooner rather than later, because it's THE system for football."

Many European cities have areas that are known for sexual activities, De Wallen in Amsterdam and Soho in London.

In the rest of the western world strip clubs are common, including full nudity and alcohol served together (in my city pop ~260,000 there are 2 strip clubs in the center of the city). 

Most shops sell softcore porn (admittedly on the top shelf), and every shop that sells magazines carrys mens entertainment such as Nuts, FHM, and Zoo. There are many easily accesible shops where you can purchase hardcore porn.

On mainland europe it is common to find nudity in magazines aimed at teens (Bravo in Germany and Switzerland) aswell as nudity on TV during the day, and hardcore porn broadcast on free channels after 10PM.

Your questions have mostly been answered, I'll just give you my opinion, as a Belgian high school student. Depending on the high school and the cities you're gonna be in, you'll be faced with a few Flemish lessons here and there, but you probably won't have to use the language, most Flemish people know French or English(and it's really sad that we, the walloons, can't say the same. I wish my people weren't lazy when it comes to language, but we're not the only ones to blame, the Communauté Française made it that way). 

High school here is very different from in the US from what I gathered. It's split in 6 years, going from the first year to the sixth (Called ""La rhéto""). You'll probably be put in rhéto or in the 5th year like many other exchange students. Here, you can't choose lessons like you would in the US, there are a few options available (Generally, Language, Science, Social Science and Economics) and in these branches, some more options, like the amount of math you get or the different languages you want to study. There aren't many excursions or activities related to the school in Wallonia, though this depends on the school. One thing that's common to almost every school is that there's a 7-days long trip when you're in rhéto, called ""Voyage rhéto"", which is basically a holiday. That's the best part (I'm going to Turkey with my school for that occasion in two weeks :)). 

On average, a school day is from 8AM to 3-4PM, with a lunch break in the middle, and a few empty hours where you get to go to the study hall or, if you're in rhétos, to the ""local rhétos"" (basically a study hall without a teacher to keep an eye on you). People, high school students here, are quite friendly (though lack maturity from my experience) and like to party, a lot. Though it seems to be less and less true the younger the generation is. Try to go and talk to the people once you're here though, because if they feel you're annoyed or not too enthusiastic when people talk to you, most students are gonna leave you alone, partly because they don't want to bother you but also because you'll appear ""cold"". In general though this isn't an issue. :) If you're here during the summer, there are festivals that are among the best in Europe, so feel free to buy yourself a ticket for Dour or Pukkelpop or whichever you like. 

And, Belgian french isn't so different from french french. Some accents are just extremely funny to hear or imitate, and there's the ""nonante / septante"" distinction, but that really is about it. 


So, a little about you now :). Where/when are you gonna be staying? Will you be in Belgium with Rotary or with another agency? Why did you choose our beautiful country? :D"

We don't even have enough stable pro football clubs to fill 2 divisions, let alone 3 or 4 and until that changes there's no point in discussing pro/rel. Furthermore, assuming that all of this changes and it becomes viable in the future, then what reason would the owners in MLS who paid tens of millions to get into the league have to accept they could now be relegated?

People need to accept that American sports culture is different and that's not an entirely bad or good thing. I would love to have a 4-tiered pyramid with pro/rel and good support at every level, but if it means that MLS becomes like EPL or La Liga where the richest teams in the biggest markets dominate and win everything then IMO it's not worth it. The NFL does well here because a publicly-owned team from a town of just 100,000 people can win the championship.

PS: to all the people saying that American soccer won't take off until we have pro/rel, you're wrong. American soccer won't take off until people like YOU stop finding excuses not to support it. A lot of those who complain about the lack of pro/rel here also complain about the quality of MLS.

I realize there are many ways of measuring competitiveness (sub-competitions for spots in Europe/avoid relegation etc.) , but what matters most is who hoists the trophy at the end of the year. To call the NFL not competitive is off in my opinion. 

I agree that promotion and relegation add another level of enjoyment into the sports, fights for promotion or to avoid relegation would benefit American sports in general (where many fans give up halfway through the season), but as a culture we are way too commercialized, and many would not go for their team dropping out of the top division.

Look at europe and it's problem with middle eastern immigrants who don't try and assimilate.  Europe values freedom and equality while the middle eastern immigrants want sharia law and want to bring their oppressive culture from the middle east and make it law in europe.  Basically have a bunch of little saudi arabias or syrias or something.

You see the conflict and riots that result.  Allow these people to become citizens and vote and as they produce more and more babies eventually they will be the majority and will vote in those laws.  Now your amazing country is a shit hole and not what it originally was because you let people with a conflicting view come in and change it.

There is nothing wrong with a country protecting it's values and not allowing people who want something else to have the right to change it.

If muslims want sharia law and religious rule they can stay in the middle east and not come to denmark or france etc.

He wrote a book called The Pink Swastika that claimed blamed the rise of Nazism on homosexuality.  
In regards to the Ugandan homosexual death penalty law, he is rapidly backpedalling now that international condemnation has been brought upon it, but Lively doesn't have his hands clean in regards to that. ""Lively released a half-hearted condemnation: ""It should be no surprise… that modern Ugandans are very unhappy that homosexual political activists from Europe and the US are working aggressively to rehomosexualise their nation."" The Ugandan law, he said, was ""unacceptably harsh"", but he praised those who drafted it. ""If the offending sections were sufficiently modified, the proposed law would represent an encouraging step in the right direction… it would deserve support from Christian believers""

Scott Lively - on the conference where the death penalty bill was first proposed - http://www.defendthefamily.com/pfrc/archives.php?id=2345952 - From his own article &gt;remember that homosexuality is literally illegal in this country. Imagine how bad things would be if the criminal law were abandoned. By the way, the false accusation against me, now circulating in the US, is that I called on the Ugandan government to force homosexuals into therapy. What I actually said is that the law against homosexuality should be liberalized to give arrestees the choice of therapy instead of imprisonment


As for Defend the Family's innocence - they're a hate organization that advocates, among other things, criminalizing sodomy to ""prevent the spread of the homosexuality"" 
&gt;Yet sodomy, especially anal sodomy, deserves to be criminalized. Although characterized by
homosexuals as a loving act, sodomy is an act of sadism and violence against the receptive partner that
often results in serious damage to the body, especially over time. That one partner consents to this
abuse should not sanctify it in the eyes of the law, any more than wife-beating should be sanctioned if a
wife consents to be beaten by her husband. Indeed, the health complications from sodomy can be
more dangerous to one’s health than a physical beating.
Perhaps the most important function of sodomy laws is to deter to the spread of homosexuality in
society.

Lively and Defend the Family can claim now that they're against the Ugandan bill, but they were instrumental in it being proposed in the first place.  

I would say the language TonyBLair used was inflammatory and over the top, but the fact of the matter is, Defend the Family is a hate group that's blamed Nazism on homosexuals, and advocated for the criminalization not just of homosexuality, but also of advocacy for homosexuality in the United States, and claimed that there's a link between homosexuality, pedophilia and incest.

Well according to the European Banking Laws, that would apply for all of the countries with in the EU. But in the matter of a bank from outside the EU it is up to the Host country to monitor the bank. Which both England and the Netherlands failed to do.  So legally the fault is yours.

&gt;To help them out, countries like England and the Netherlands payed for that in advance, many billions of euro, and the details of the loans would be worked out later.

This is just not true, England and the Netherlands did in fact pay their people, but without asking Iceland if they were going to pay or not.

Several, because multiple governments and politicians fell over it, trying to make or prevent a deal, after which the people shot down any pay-back proposal.

The people of Iceland never saw that money, it was only the few bankers, and now after the financial crisis, Iceland see's it self being bullied by the Netherlands and England,  to become even poorer, you actually want to make a profit from ""Deciding to loan us money we didn't ask from you"".

$30 a night for a hostel room, $10 a day for cheap food, and about $6 a day for tickets/admission to museums, etc. You'll also need $4-6 a day for public transit but you can buy weekly cards in some cities that may make it cheaper. If you plan on drinking or eating at nicer places, obviously it's going to be a bit more.

I guess the prices I gave you are good Paris/Amsterdam prices. Berlin is a bit cheaper, anywhere in Switzerland is more expensive (especially food).

Could Cap and Trade Cause Another Market Meltdown?

http://www.crimeandfederalism.com/2010/06/summary-of-capandtrade-legislation.html

Banks like JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs already have active carbon trading desks that deal in instruments connected to Europe's cap-and-trade system and voluntary markets here. But business will explode if a cap-and-trade system becomes law. So it's no surprise that the financial industry has taken an intense interest in the fine print of the Waxman-Markey bill. According to data compiled by the Center for Public Integrity, the financial services industry has 130 lobbyists working on climate issues, compared to almost none in 2003. They represent companies like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and AIG (before it was shamed into temporarily halting its lobbying activities last fall).

The ""enlightenment"" if anything made the Western world far more barbaric and ruthless and provided the ideological justifications for its heinously brutal imperialist activities at the time. Ideological racism, for example, was one of the most prominent products of the European ""enlightenment"" which was used as a rationalization for the numerous genocidal imperial projects throughout the globe.

However economists agree that the main driver for improved working conditions is rising per capita productivity. As technology and specialization of labor have increased with time, each individual worker has been able to produce more valuable products. This allows total wages to rise, and working conditions are a part of total wages.

The oft-criticized industrial revolution, then, produced the greatest increase in working conditions in human history. In the late 1800's, millions of people across America and Western Europe _voluntarily_ left their farms to go work in factories because, despite the huge drawbacks, factories afforded them better conditions and a higher and more reliable salary than subsistence agrarianism. Then as the revolution continued with the invention of the moving assembly line, the transistor, and then finally the computer, working conditions continued to improve.

See further info in the Baldy Harper essay to which I linked.

But, since you asked: I don't know a whole lot about the labor laws of Hong Kong, but I do know that they are considered the most capitalist place on Earth, and that up until 2010 they had never had any minimum wage law at all. From what I hear, it's a decent place with fairly happy people."

&gt; It has existed since at least 450BC.


The Romans made up the term ""Palestina""when they conquered the area, about 135, following the fall of a Jewish revolt led by Bar Kokhba in 132–135. They imposed that term on it because it was linguistically similar to ""Plishtim"", the Philistines (who came from the Greek area) - a long-standing historic enemy of the Israelites. The Philistines are not the antecedents of the people currently known as Palestinians (before 1948 - the only people known by that term were the Jews of the land mass). There is no ""P"" sound in the Arabic language. ""P"" is usually pronounced as ""F"" (""Palestine"" is pronounced as ""Falestine""). At the end of a word, the usual sound is ""B"" ('Zip"" is pronounced 'Zib'.)

""The name Palestine, which the Romans had bestowed on the conquered and subjugated land of Judaea, had been retained for a time by the Arab conquerors to designate an administrative subdivision of their Syrian province. But that name had disappeared in the country even before the arrival of the Crusaders nine centuries ago. It had returned in Europe with the revival of classical learning at the time of the Renaissance, and was commonly applied by European Christians to what they had previously called the Holy Land, By the early twentieth century, with the predominance of European influence and with it of the European language of discourse, the name Palestine came to be used even in the country. This use was, however, in the main confined to Christians and to a very small group of westernized Muslims. The name was not used officially, and had no precise territorial definition until it was adopted by the British to designate the area which they acquired by conquest at the end of World War I and ruled under mandate form the League of Nations.” Bernard Lewis (*Semites and Anti-Semitism*)

Early-on, I started to wonder how well-grounded this author's view on relevant history and social context was, and by the end it seems to break down completely

For instance:
&gt;The Hispanic desire to be part of America at a civic level is evident in the huge recruitment rates of Hispanics in the US military.

That's a very *special* way of interpreting that statistic. I would venture that this is more representative of the increased recruitment of those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, but he intends to argue that it demonstrates how ethnic integration in the US is *different* from Europe because immigrants want to integrate to American society.

Which leads us to one of the highly contestable (probably just flat-out wrong) ideas in his essay: that ethnic integration in the US was successful and smooth because multiculturalism was not practiced. Firstly, the cultural clashes that Europe and Australia claim to be experiencing from immigration are nothing foreign to US history. Immigration in the US has always met resistance on social, cultural, and racial levels. Think about the experiences of the first Irish immigrants, *50 freakin years of Chinese exclusion*, Japanese internment, issues with Hmong ethnic societies forming in the US, Filipino treatment in the US, and modern reaction to Mexican immigration, and so on. Have we forgotten history so readily? There is nothing unique about Europe's integration issues.

It seems more sound to say that if there is successful integration in the US and not Europe, it's because the US has been doing it longer.

He even goes on to rather explicitly echo the Model Minority Myth (one of the most subtle and deeply racist notions prevailing in society today), and also attributes things like 
&gt;violence and misogyny, drugs and gang and ethnic conflict

to multiculturalism, when I would rather think those are tell-tale signs of poverty. 

Finally we get to the part where he backs-up the claims that his society is declining as a result of this mixing, which is incidentally where it really starts to fall apart.

&gt;I wandered into the Muslim bookshop. I was astounded to see titles such as The International Jew or The Truth about the Pope, amid a welter of anti-Semitic, anti-Christian and pro-extremist literature.

And when I wander into a Fox News store, I am astounded to see Glenn Beck's books lining the shelves. This doesn't make it a nucleus of cultural secession.

&gt;The advent of satellite television made it easier for these folks to live a life apart. Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV station was available on satellite packages. Most Arab homes you went into had Arabic TV playing in the background. The anti-social behaviour became more acute.

Maintaining ties to your own culture is anti-social? This guy begins to echo the worst aspects of the Model Minority Myth-- that you are only desirable if you strive to be like the white majority.

And this guy is walking around immigrant peoples' houses? Am I still supposed to take this as reality or is it becoming a work of fiction?"

As for the 2003 war. It totally and utterly made me sick when I saw that coundown in 2003 on tv and then the bombs started falling. I think it was handling completely wrong. Obviously now most people agree that they were fed lies and it turned out to be a very bad decision. The whole war on terror which led to the rise of the calling for an Iraq War was totally misused in my opinion. Iraq did not have ties to terrorism abroad, and many other countries deserved the scrutiny Iraq was recieving. 

Right now, I am most worried about Iraq being goverened  by extremist's who will try to turn Iraq into an islamic state. I personally enjoyed the level of secularism under Saddam's regime.

I was actually born during the Gulf War (1991) and so all the information I have about it is from what I've read, documentaries I've seen, and talking to my family. Obviously an invasion of another country isn't okay. From what I've seen, it wasn't made clear to Saddam that the international community would react violently to his actions, and in particular by the US which I think gave him false hope. I admit, it's hard not to feel some national pride of not letting other countries push you around, but I do understand the UN did what it had to do. As for the reasons the war started, I can understand why Iraq would be furious if Kuwait had been tapping into Iraqi reserves, or if they had been purposely diluting oil prices but the reasons have been disputed so I shouldn't be commenting on that since I don't know the exact situtation that caused the invasion. 

During that period, when I was still a newborn baby, all of the people from the nothern region of Iraq were fleeing either to Turkey or Iran because of the fighting taking place between Saddam and the Kurds. I've heard terrible stories from my mother nursing me in a car with items under her feet, my sister on one side of her and a couple other small children crammed on her other side in a tiny car with me in her arms to stories about kurdish families tossing their newborns off cliffs in fear that the army would hear the child crying, to many of the other newborns dying because their mothers fed them formula made with unclean water. 

My dad was left in Kuwait after the army retreated and was forced to find his own way home. 

What really crippled Iraq were the sanctions imposed after the gulf war. They really made rebuilding after the two previous wars impossible. Way of life in Iraq prior to the Iran-Iraq war had been relatively good. The people had money, I heard stories about how the Dinar was stronger than most world currencies. People would go to tour Europe all the time. In fact, Saddam had actually focused on building hospitals and schools before the wars began. If I could change one thing, I think it would have been the sanctions. "

The Celts leave us no lasting legacy in the arts, math and science.  In everything that has come down to us - coinage, statues, and civil engineering - the Romans matched or exceeded the Celts.  Militarily, the Celts were apparently no match for Roman military engineering, weapon production, and social order.  In other words, the Celts were nothing special as a compelling counter-narrative; there are at least a half-dozen other ancient civilizations with a claim to comparable sophistication.

The Romans were brutal, but they were also cosmopolitan, successful, and obsessed with practical engineering and a stable social order.  Perhaps most importantly, they had an eye to the future informed by their unique sense of their own *dignitas* and *auctoritas*.  They kept records, standardized, and generally set the tone that drives western civilization long after the last legions stopped marching.

Perhaps the Celts might have been better ""custodians of Europe"", but I suspect that the unusual length of the Roman era (being as it is an outlier in history) would have been difficult to improve on.  Further, I can't imagine a scenario in which the Celts could have superseded Rome without resorting to Roman-style brutality.

The Celts are fascinating in their own right, but I fear you're overstating your case much in the way that those who talk about the ""advanced"" Native American tribes often do.  Nobody is suggesting that theses were cavemen."

On their own behalf they were happy to go around having as much sex as they like(which is really no different to Britain or anywhere in Europe really) but most of them stated they would not date a slut.

When I enquired what the terminology slut referred to in this case they told me it was a girl that slept around. So these guys I was ""hanging out"" with were trying to find random sex whilst simultaneously knocking girls for sleeping around.

I think with more experience I have realised American men are often uncomfortable with sexually active girls but take  opportunity to have casual sex themselves.

It's a shame too some of those American women had me mumbling like an idiot. I suppose the best thing to do is offer to show around any attractive American women coming to the UK lol.

It is a rather foul attitude though. I mean as long as your safe and you have fun there is no tangible downside to casual sex and whether or not somebody has had one partner or ten makes no tangible difference.

And he was the embodiment of what islam is. 

I believe the Muslim world got to the place its at today because they searched for glory in things other than islam, they lost in most of europe wars they engaged in because they were fighting in the name of secular causes, our lands were conquered and our spirits broken. We forgot how to act in the Islamic fashion that drove the Muslims of the past to great hights. 

It reminds me of a story of umar ibn al khattab, when he was on his way to meet with the nobles of Jerusalem to recieve the keys to the city, he had taken a Servant with him and he would alternate taking turns with this Sergent riding on the camel, one would ride whole the other would walk, when they started approaching the city it was the servants turn to ride, but the servant was shy to be riding on the camel when they arrived, because it would look lowly of umar to be walking while his servant was riding in front of these nobels who were expecting a jaded king, so the servant expressed his feelings to umar and told him to enter the city riding the camel even though it was not his turn and umar responded with these words ""we are a people god has given us honor through islam, if we search for honor elsewhere, we would surely be humiliated""

if we don't get back to learning islam in a scholarly way we'll never succeed, because wanting to be a scholar or even a bit learned in islam drives you to learning about the world we're in, you will notice that allot of the muslim scholars of the past were also scientists and mathematicians. "

Remember that if you are long a call and short a put of the same strike price, that's effectively the same as owning the stock in terms of responses to price changes -- if it goes up, you make money on the call; if it goes down, you owe money on the put.  You effectively have a future (right and obligation) to buy the stock at the strike price.

C(call price) - P(put price)  = S(stock price) - K(strike price) + dividend/interest adjustments.

The quantity on the left is the value of the long call / short put position; the amount on the right is the value of the future.  The reason for the interest adjustments is that unlike buying the stock now, you get to hold on to your $ until the option expiration, which is worth something (S exp(-rT) in fact).  If the stock pays dividends before option exercise (assuming the options are European; w/ american options, things are a bit more complicated), you have a future for the ex-dividend stock, so you need to subtract out the discounted dividend flow.  

Anyway, given these equations, if you plug in the values of the current stock price, option strike, call value and int/div adjustment parameters, you can get the value of the put.  "

It's not pedantic to expect you to not claim that a libertarian society would look like Africa. Expecting you to honestly represent my political believes is a reasonable expectation in normal political discussion.

&gt;no environmental laws. no labor laws. 

I wouldn't even say libertarianism is against environmental laws. You could have government agents police emissions to ensure no pollutants are being emitted and that would be consistent with free market principles.

Labor laws wouldn't exist, but who gives a shit? You don't have to work for a company that has poor work safety standards, and they will see it in their interest to improve work safety to attract workers, since it is a type of benefit just like wages.

&gt;no guarantee of education or healthcare.

Yep, you take risks of having nothing in a free market society, but the economy develops faster, so you have a higher likelihood of having a higher standard of living. 

Either way, you will face risks in life. From what I can see, risks are lower when wages and per capita GDP are higher. Hong Kong and Singapore were third world countries 60 years ago, have topped the economic freedom index for the last 16 years in a row, have no minimum wage, have half as much social welfare spending per capita as Europe, have had the most rapid economic growth of any nations in the world over the last 60 years, and today have higher life expectancy than every European country with a population of 0.1 million+."

In a perfect internet, I could go back and change the title to ""Yes, let's be concerned about the nuclear plant accident, but please don't focus on it to the exclusion of all else."" Which, as someone who lives within Japan's borders, looked a lot to me like that very thing was happening.

The thing about ""leaving an entire area uninhabitable for centuries"" is very much an open question, as is just about everything else regarding this accident. I'm the farthest thing from a nuclear power expert, but it is that fact that prevents me from arriving at any conclusion.

The living conditions in the immediate area around the plant are cause for concern, yes. I never denied that. What I *do* believe is that the area is far more limited in scope than the offshore media is making it out to be (why are so many foreign residents fleeing Tokyo when radiation readings there were never a threat to health?). I also believe that when media are putting out articles with alarmist headlines about a radiation ""plume"" threatening the United States or Europe, it's going too far. 

Debate this with me all you like -- I know I could be wrong, because I'm not an expert. But I'm going to believe it until I see evidence otherwise, as I'm sure you will believe what you believe, too. And I see evidence of too many rag newspapers and raging bloggers using this accident to make a case against nuclear power, or present their government-gag-order shoot-the-witnesses stories, and so on.

I am keen to make people understand, the earthquake did not ""just shake for some time"" and then it was over. The homes and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people were utterly destroyed. It's not a case of ""bah, they can rebuild in ten years and then everything will be just fine after that"". Tragedies on this kind of scale last a lifetime. It doesn't have to be ""nuclear"" to be so.

Now, after Fukushima, the emergency regulation is again in effect, which allows higher contamination for Japanese products, again with the argument to prevent food shortages. There is no food shortage though. Japanese products are in no way relevant for food supplies in europe."

Two little more nuggets of information. In Britain when they did adopt the Gregorian calendar, there were riots with people demanding that they be given back the 11 days (which had been added to correct the calendar).

Finally, New Years was not always celebrated on 1 January in Medieval Europe with some countries celebrating it at different times. In England, and elsewhere, a common start for the new year was Lady Day or the Feast of the Annunciation on 25 March. Though iNew Year then shifted to 1 January, the Court of Chancery kept recording things from Lady Day. When the calendar changed, the date changed to 5 April.

From a socialist, largely pacifist European:

Intervening in Libya was...

THE RIGHT THING TO DO

Kadaffi was carrying out a massacre.

The Libyans were asking for intervention. (!!)

The African league, Arab league were asking for intervention.

The U.N. security council was asking for intervention.

Libya is easy to defend from above due to stretched deserts.

You don't need to have troops on the ground. 


It's a relative cheap mission since European military bases are nearby.

People in the Middle-East will hate you more if you don't intervene (yes!), it proofs their suspicion that you're not treating them as human beings and intervene only for oil.

Quite possibly the conditions have never been so right for an intervention. Just get your asses out of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq and do something useful for a change. No, I don't mean put troops on the ground or arm the rebels. There's absolutely no reason to that. Just be patient, keep carrying out the mission, and Kadaffi will fall.

As for the stupidest part: NO, INTERVENING IN ONE COUNTRY DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE TO INTERVENE IN ALL COUNTRIES. How can you even begin to think that? The situations are all entirely different. Was there any moment when there was a reason to intervene in Egypt? No. Was there any moment when there was a reason to intervene in Tunisia? No. Why not? Because they were different countries, different people, different politics, different culture. I can't believe even someone with the intelligence of Jon Stewart is to caught up in the American world view too much to be able to see that.

From a high-level, reasons why we shouldn't/aren't going to intervene in other countries:

Afghanistan, Iraq - No local support for intervention (oh, you mean you forgot to check that?)

Saudi-Arabia - Christians marching into Mecca, that'll go well

Bahrein - Government protected by Saudi-Arabia, no local support for intervention

Yemen - Situation is more similar to that of Tunisia than that of Libya, no local support for intervention

Ivory Coast - 10.000 strong U.N. force already present, U.S. army is not equipped to fight in jungles

Syria - Israel will either block or join intervention, too dangerous, reforms already taking place, president still popular, will take time, no local support for intervention

Jordan - Relatively modern country, popular monarchy, reforms taking place, no local support for intervention

Iran - Too powerful, no local support for intervention

Sudan - See Somalia

Somalia - See Sudan

Lacking an independent (Arab-)Palestinian government, the UN treaty suggested that in the partition of the English mandate of Palestina the Arab parts would be governed by already established Arabian governments in the region, namely those of Egypt and (Trans-)Jordan. At the time, this was not an alternative for Israeli rule, but for self-governance of the Palestinians.

&gt;Yes because Egypt would frequently capture/destroy commercial &gt;vessels traversing the canal. The British and French also weren't &gt;happy about that so they attacked too.

Almost, but not quite. This was indeed the political propaganda of the time, but by now it's become pretty clear that the French and English instigated the Israeli attack, to have an excuse to get control over the Suez-channel. It was kind of a last hurrah of European imperialist policy in Africa.

&gt;Nasser put troops on the Sinai border and expelled the UNEF troops. &gt;Pretty clearly a sign of war.

This too was not an isolated event. Especially with hindsight (but it must've been fairly clear at the time too), it turns out Nasser was mostly trying to get Israel to relieve pressure on Lebanon, by drawing some troops down to the south border. The idea that there was a plan to actually attack (let alone a *clear* sign), is unbased. At any rate, letting go the non-existance of a distinction between pre-emptive and aggressive when it comes to war, the Egyptian people are not very likely to see Israeli aggression on their country as justified."

The clothing all typically come in the same sizes for men (40-42 jacket, 32 pants and size 2 for women) since models have pretty strict measurement requirements.  These are known as sample sizes.  

While this ""ideal"" size should fit perfectly on an ""ideal"" model, that is rarely the case.  This type of clothing is called off the rack, which is sold to the general American public and not tailor made for shoots.  As we all know, the average American comes in all weight and height, so it makes more sense to lean on the larger end so more can wear it rather than making them slimmer so less can fit in them.  There is also vanity sizes where a size 2 is really a size 4 or a Large from an European or Japanese brand is really a M in America.  So the sizes vary a great deal and very inconsistent from brand to brand.  

Anyways, back to the shoot.  The stylist with his many assistants puts the clothing on the model.  Sometimes it fit great (jeans, t-shirts, larger jackets, etc) but when it comes to suits, there is definitely a look.  Pants are hemmed on set for bigger shoots but it's unrealistic to as a tailor to take in a sleeve or make the waist smaller...especially if we are shooting 10-30 looks a day.  This where the stylist comes in with his box of clips and hides everything in the back.  It's fast, easy, and doesn't damage the clothing.  While the stylist for the shoot works for the client just like the photographer, they are never on staff, which means sample sizes have to be returned in the same fashion in which they were sent.  

The last bit of reason why it's all clipped is the camera, especially shooting on a longer lens compresses the image.  This is commonly known as the camera adding 10 pounds.  This is very true, especially for fashion so clothing and models have to appear even skinnier in person before the shot.          "

Really? All reports I heard was that there *would be* a massacre. Not that there was. And as far as **civil fucking wars** go, it's to be expected. You don't have a civil war and win simply because you started it. You will die in large numbers for what you believe in and there's not a god damned thing wrong with that. And considering all that, the numbers of dead in Libya and the rate of death are next to nothing when compared to what's going on in Ivory Coast.

&gt; The Libyans were asking for intervention.

Who cares what they asked? People have been asking for help for decades and they never get it. Why these guys and why now?

&gt; The African league, Arab league were asking for intervention.

The Arab League is a bunch of *ROYAL DESPOTS*. Do you know or care who is in the Arab League? It's not a like it's all innocent people looking out for the best interest of Arabs everywhere. It's a collective that contains some of the most brutal rulers in the region. Notice how they about-faced after we began our campaign? That's because the Arab League was using this for political gain. Notice how Saudia Arabia, a member of the Arab League, is practically invading Bahrain and killing Bahrainian civilians? Who gives a fuck about what the Arab League says?

&gt; The U.N. security council was asking for intervention.

Again, so what? The UN security council is still made up of representatives of other nations. So you've basically saying that Portugal and Gabon and India and Bosnia all said ""Hey someone's got to do something!"" and that's justification? FFS!

&gt; Libya is easy to defend from above due to stretched deserts.

How does this even factor in?

&gt; You don't need to have troops on the ground.

This is the fucking Powell Doctrine that we hate so much and your *lauding it*? Carpet bomb the country? Cluster bomb the country? Cruise missile the country? Sort out the guilty body parts from the innocent body parts later? Fuck everything about this. Convenient war is not better, it is worse. This is disgusting. But I'll make it to the end of your post, I promise.

&gt; It's a relative cheap mission since European military bases are nearby.

Same as above. Wow. Just fucking wow. Because we've been working to build a network of cooperative military bases around the world that can be used by the major world powers, we're able to implement **cost-effective world-wide war far, constantly, unendingly and without generating enough stress on the populations in the first world to spur an outcry** and this is part of your justification. *We have always been at war with Oceania.*

&gt; People in the Middle-East will hate you more if you don't intervene (yes!), it proofs their suspicion that you're not treating them as human beings and intervene only for oil.

Intervening in a country with massive oil reserves and significant oil fields does not help this. If we wanted to make Arab people love us, which we clearly don't, then we'd help countries that had nothing to do with oil (or opium). I also love that your justification here boils down to *""they'll love of us if we violently murder others""*. Beautiful. I couldn't have said it better myself.

&gt; Quite possibly the conditions have never been so right for an intervention. Just get your asses out of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq and do something useful for a change. No, I don't mean put troops on the ground or arm the rebels. There's absolutely no reason to that. Just be patient, keep carrying out the mission, and Kadaffi will fall.

I don't understand what the obsession is with bring down Kadaffi. Bad man, got it. Are you saying it's the responsibility of all ""well-ruled"" peoples to topple what we deem are ""bad rulers""? Why haven't you guys come over and toppled our government for kidnapping, torturing, and imprisoning innocent people indefinitely? Oh wait, it's because most of Europe was complicit and many countries were active participants in these crimes against humanity. Right. May the rest of the world have mercy on us when they finally get armed by China and find they can use the Powell Doctrine against us using every single argument you just gave.

&gt; As for the stupidest part: NO, INTERVENING IN ONE COUNTRY DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE TO INTERVENE IN ALL COUNTRIES. How can you even begin to think that?

It's not about intervening in all countries. It's about why Libya and not Ivory Coast? Why Libya and not Bahrain? You claim all of these humanitarian reasons and completely deny that oil has any part of our strategy (against all evidence to the contrary). These are examples of humanitarian crises that require our attention moreso than Libya and yet we're in Libya and not those other places. Why? You say because Libya is a war of convenience but also because all of these people asked us to. Well, why did they ask us? It couldn't possibly be that so many other nations are also addicted to oil. That the UN is onboard with the neo-con policy of creating a global regime in control of major world resources. That countries are strong-armed by the US into various diplomatic actions that allow us to justify an unjustified war. No one in the security council is demanding help in the Ivory Coast? I wonder why in the world that could be?

&gt; *Long list of over simplistic and unsupported reasons why you think we're absolved of the responsibility that so greatly rests upon us in Libya*

You're view of military strategy is from that of a civilian. Read up on military strategy for the last 50 years in the major super powers. Review the Monroe Doctrine in the US. Research what's taught as overarching military strategy in the War College. Read up on the roles of military intelligence throughout the world, including domestically. Try to understand that your simplistic view of these events is drawn almost entirely from the propaganda that these military organizations put out. You are repeating to us what the news has already told us, what the media has read from press releases coming straight out of the military and you are denying any facts they deny.

You are a parrot of the worst kind in that you demand endless war, endless killing, endless suffering, in the name of peace, hope, change, and prosperity, all while watching those things disappear and wondering why. Get educated and fight the good fight. Stop suckling from the teat of misinformation and propaganda and start thinking for yourself. And if you really want this much war and death in the world, I can only hope that people like you become correctly marginalized in the discussion. You are spewing death from your mouth and calling it life. You'd do best to shut that maw and go learn about exactly what it is you find convenient, affordable, and justified. Maybe next time you open it you'll say something that will help."

Had the South been left to peacefully secede, eventually their European trading partners would have pressured them to abolish the infernal institution, as they themselves had done.

Another one to add to your list is the thousands of troops remaining in Iraq.

All through 2008 he stated combat operations would end but a remaining 40-60 thousands troops would remain. Now everybody is pretending this is a broken promise, when he said it all along. You can disagree, fine, just don't pretend it's a lie. And don't pretend it's weird either, you have more troops in Germany than you do in Iraq. Your ignorance on standard military practice when combat operations end (i.e - war) mixed with ignorance on what a candidate promised, is not the fault of the elected candidate.

Or someone will link a video to him as a **senator** pre-campaign saying something different about Iraq other than his **campaign** stance, and pretend that's what he promised as he ran for president.

Historical: The notion in the late 1800s of creating a refuge for Jews by displacing Arabs does not seem like a good idea to me. European countries (and the US) should have instead worked against antisemitism in their own countries. The British Balfour promise and the promises to Arabs around the first world war were contradictory--promising to give the same land to two different peoples. Up to and after the Second World War, a series of studies on how to handle the situation were carried out and generally supported a single state, but in 1948 the UN cut up the land into two regions, displeasing both parties. I think this was the setup for much future hostility.

Israel immediately declared itself a state, and set to stealing more land and resources than given, displacing thousands of Palestinians by the truckload to bordering nations (who *still* reside in ""temporary"" camps), murdering entire towns, etc.  Israel has almost always been better funded, supported, organized, and prepared for attack than the surrounding Arab nations.

More recent: Israel continues to deny Palestine's right to exist and continues to settle on Palestinian land. They have upheld a virtual blockade of Palestine for decades and created a humanitarian crisis there. They respond to a few rockets from Palestine with undue force and with no reprimand from the U.S.  Though they are armed to the teeth and receive billions in aid yearly, they complain that they are the ones with greater security concerns."

Your trip seems to be exactly on the Route no. 12. I have some experience with no 6, but I am sure that things will not be very different. 

From what I saw, I'd say it's very hard to couchsurf when doing a long tour on the bicycle, since you have to arrange for hosting quite some time in advance and rarely your plans will match your actual mileage for one day (this goes double for having somebody with you, since you'll be forced to ride to the lowest common denominator).

Since we're talking about western Europe the cycling infrastructure will be very, very good - I bet you won't even need to get off the bike trail. Maps (cycling ones) will also be pretty easy to find in the libraries along the way.

My suggestion is to be careful not to overpack... the temptation will be quite big, and even if your legs will thank you later, you'll end up dropping non-essentials on the way. ;)"

(The patent is actually almost two decades old and came from a few European countries, despite the last year's viral Japanese video.)

The amount of energy needed to convert for example thermoplastics to oil, with a very high conversion rate, *and* to separate out waste from the final product is much less than the energy available and easily accessible in the given oil (by for example a combustion engine).

Furthermore, most uses for this technology are in processing waste materials, the destruction (at best) or disposal (at worst) is often costly. These waste materials come as both bi-products and end-products in the entire chain from drilled oil, through refined oil products, through plastic goods, to plastic waste.

Saying that it's undesireable technology because it encourages plastic waste is a very weak argument in my opinion. While I do agree with you that we should control production of waste plastic, and indeed wasteful production of plastic alltogether, this does not exclude this case from the normal practice of treating *both* causes and symptoms. This thinking can easily be extended to any human-caused or human-causeable problems in the world:

Cleaning up mercury and heavy metals from the Earth's biomass. - Don't do it because if it becomes an industry then it will try to get more mercury into fish for it to clean up!

Cure cancer. - Don't do it, the medical industry will try to get more people cancer so they have to pay them to cure them!

Any altruistic problem solving, all such actions, have to be done without profits! So we can be sure their intentions are pure! Within our capitalist system. Best of luck to them.

But while I disagree with you there, I think there's one possibly undesireable consequence of the technology, in that it makes more oil available for combustion, which may very well overflow the greenhouse cup."

First of all , it's not a genetics paper, why would it be in a genetics journal? Second of all I never said that skin colour = race. Both Ainu and most native Europeans have light skin, but are not closely related. Australian Aborigines and Pygmies are dark skinned but again, not closely related.  However, in many places racial variation is not very clinal at all (eg. Pygmies and Bantu speaking peoples in West Africa and Khoisan and Bantus in South Africa). I would also point out that skin colour does not correlate very well with latitude (compare skin colour of natives of rainy and cool tasmania to those of hot and sunny florida, or to Ecuador (right on the equator), or to those in Bulgaria at the same distance to the equator as Tasmania). Anyway, this is all beside the point. The point is that this is a study about a trait of medical importance.

After WW2 due to losing a major war and political events these Germans had to abandon their homes that they had been living in for centuries.

some of it is literal and some of it is pure allegory. This is explicitly acknowledged in the Quran. 

&gt;If two passages contradict each other, the one writen later really supersedes the older ones?

there aren't genuine contradictions. There are explicit abrogations though. (the rule used to be this, now it is this). This was done intentionally, as the Quran was revealed to people over 23 years. You don't change a society overnight, change takes time. So for example, early on the rule was don't pray while drunk and later it became don't drink at all. Some people can quit cold turkey, but many cannot.

&gt;Striving to institute worldwide Shari'a law is really a religious duty?

umm no, that's wartime propagandist nonsense. 

&gt;Is true that in the quran Democracy and free speach are abominations and must be eliminated?

Both these points are more wartime propaganda. I can almost hear Bush saying ""they hate us for our freedom""

Islamic society has historically managed some forms of representative government through systems of mutual consultation, called shura, also baiyah, which is like popular declarations of loyalaty, etc. The Quran obviously doesn't use the word democracy, but there isn't really anything wrong with the concept in theory. In practice, democracy can lead to injustice, which is against Islam, but properly moderated and regulated democracy, which is basically what we try to do in western countries, is probably just fine. 

&gt;Attemps to introduce the shari'a law in legal systems of Europe?

I don't even know what this means. Does it mean people are trying to arbitration their marriage, divorce, child custody arrangements? If so, what is the big deal, Jewish minorities have been doing this for a while now. Of course, that's not the image this is trying to give you. It wants you to think that Muslims want to institute criminal penalties for crimes. That's not true. 

&gt;Shari'a law is the word of allah and any other form of government is a sin?

sharia is a system of law dervied in part from the word of God. Other government is not necessarily sinful - see above on democracy. 

&gt;Is it the duty of every muslim to keep striving until all governments have been converted to shari'a law?

oh brother - no. more propaganda.

&gt;Are muslims allowed to deceive non-muslims if it helps islam?

no, this is a common tactic of people that attack islam. You basically silence your critics and create an artificial monopoly on truth by saying ""they're just lying to you."" How can I prove to you I'm not lying? It's a totally bogus claim. It also prevents people from speaking out on what they believe. Instead, this guy gets to you tell you. 

The concept is taqiya - in the Quran it says that if a Muslim is threatened with death and he renounces his religion to save his life, then he will not be held in sin for actually renouncing his faith, but even then it's better not to say it at all. 

People take this concept that you are allowed to ""lie"" by saying you're not Muslim to save your life, and they run wild saying we're lying about everything. what the hell. 

&gt;All non-muslims living in non-islamic states are enemies?

no. I pay my taxes. I support my government. I'm a model employee (except when i'm on reddit). 

&gt;Deceiving westerners is encouraged if it can forward the goals of the spread of islam?

more nutty propaganda. Again, how could anybody disprove this - the answer is always, ""they're just lying to take over the world!"" 

This always happens in wartime. the opponents are demonized in media as subversive elements in society threatening to destroy our way of life, and take over the world. The Russians, the Japanese, the Spanish as early as the 1900s, etc. They used to say Japanese are atheists who eat babies as part of blood ceremonies. Seriously, they said stuff like that during ww2. Every single person we fight ends up getting torn up in the press, whether true or false. 

&gt;Was the Islamic American Relief Agency giving money to terrorists?

after 9/11 the IRS froze every single Islamic charity in America and heavily audited their books for *years*. It wasted a lot of charity money unfortunately because people gave this money and it couldn't be used as intended. Then the IRS went and found contributions to other charities (the way charity is normally distributed) who were actually in a position to do work on the ground. From there, the money can be siphoned off by corrupt people to aid in militant activity. For any money sent to help Palestinians, this almost always was sent through acting Palestinian government or infrastructure, namely PLO, then Fateh or Hamas. Remember Hamas has a militant wing, but they also build hospitals, schools, etc. If an American dollar ended up in a Hamas-funded hospital, even *before* Hamas was put on the list of terrorist groups, that charity was shut down and all its assets were seized. Most of these charities had no interest in getting involved in military conflict, they just wanted to build infrastructure, but the state department has labeled basically every Palestinian organization to be terrorists, consistent with Israeli policy to toe the line of a humanitarian crisis in the occupied territories. As you can see, this is a little more subtle and complicated than ""Islamic American Relief Agency"" was giving money to terrorists. And if you're talking about the charity called ""Islamic Relief"" or www.irw.org, then they are squeaky clean, 4-star charity as rated on charitynavigator.org, and they survived the audit because they actually do their own work - they buy their own trucks, rice, grain, water, and they distribute it themselves. A lot of charities got busted for giving money to the wrong grain-buyers. What a joke.

I wrote reviews and previews, and was Editor-in-Chief of a small but professional videogame website. I think we need some perspective here.

Firstly, the obvious: Game companies want videogame websites to talk about their games. They want as much information flowing out as often as possible. It's basically another form of advertising - the more game websites that talk about a game, the more gamers are likely to see that, and the more of those who are likely to actually *buy* the game. This is Advertising 101.

Naturally, a game's developer or publisher is going to be enthusiastic about their game. Even if we aren't completely cynical and assume that it's some act put on to encourage enthusiasm in the media... the game is their baby. It's their work, what they've been pouring themselves into for months, maybe years. They have a vested interest in believing that their game is the best thing in the world, not just because they want it to sell, but because it's what they've been working on, and everyone wants to think that what they're working on is wonderful.

A small detour for a moment - anyone here remember Street Fighter: The Movie: The Game? Yes, that god-awful stain on the Street Fighter name. One of the project leads for that game wrote a fascinating post on a videogame messageboard a while back (I think it was on shoryuken.com), talking about that game's development history. It's well worth a read. Anyway, this guy knew it was crap, he knew it had problems, and he seemed to indicate that everyone on the dev team kinda' had that same feeling... but they took pride in what they did *right*. They had a ton of characters! They were working with cutting-edge digitized graphics! They got Hollywood actors *in the game*!  They were creating new moves and doing new, inventive things that had never been done in a Street Fighter game before! And they were very excited about it. And why not? It was Street Fighter! Besides, who would want to take a moment, look inside, and admit that all their months of time, hard work, passion, sweat and tears were going into making a shitty game based on a shitty movie?

The ""kid with a lemonade stand"" comparison seems very apt, but it's not because of some pressure the developer or publisher is intentionally putting on you as a writer. It's because they've developed an emotional attachment to their baby, that's still a work-in-progress, and it's fairly clear that if you're overly-critical at this point, it'll kinda' be crushing for them. This is also why they often demonstrate product with multiple people in the room - they want everything to go right, they want to be sure that their baby isn't done an injustice when one of them can't answer a question, they want to be absolutely prepared. I can certainly understand the feeling of being ganged-up on, but I also understand that the reason behind this activity isn't malicious in intent.

Now, as for the writing part of things... yeah, as a writer, you're going to have to write about things you don't know a damn thing about. The videogame industry is huge, and has expanded to fill some very obscure niches. There's going to be games you'll have to cover in genres that no one on your staff has any experience or even interest in. I've written previews for games featuring topics like marathon running and raising and taking care of a horse. Hell, I was our website's designated ""girl game"" reviewer, and I am neither a girl, nor do I have a daughter, nor am I six. And I can't tell you the number of previews I wrote for games based on cartoons and animes that I'd never seen.

If you work for any reasonably-sized game review website, odds are good that you're occasionally going to write articles about games that mystify you. It simply can't be helped. Even if none of the writers on staff are interested in the topic matter, a portion of the readership might be.

Game publishers know this, and often try to make things easier by including a product sheet with a run-down of the game's features and/or basic premise. They're not trying to ""write the article for you"", but give you information you can use to write the article. A sheet that says ""there are over 100 cars in this game"" or ""this is the first game in the series to take place in exotic European locales"" or ""Featuring the story of Bob the Knight as he fights through the hordes of evil donkey-men to save the beautiful princess Bibi"" isn't the sort of thing that a game writer is supposed to copy word-for-word, but rather, to refer back to.

1. Same protest happened in Libya that happened around the region.

2. Gaddafi uses blunt force against civilians.

3. Civilians push back and liberate eastern part of Libya and move towards Surt and Tripoli to liberate whole country.

4. Forces loyal of Gaddafi push opposition forces back to Bengazi by using heavy artillery on heavily populated areas.

5. Libyan opposition asks for foreign intervention and arab league make that request formally.

6. UN security council votes and agrees on measures to be made against Gaddafi.

7. French airplanes attack tanks on the way to Bengazi and allied missile and airstrikes begin.


Why would US or any European country attack Libya for oil because Tony Blair and George W Bush shook hands with Gaddafi and oil has flown since 2003 from Libya to western markets?

Renewables allow everyone to play a part, the farmer, the factories, the house, the business office and the plethora of companies that can provide a fail safe mix of disparate, interconnected and distributed grid systems. 

The financial side is also that everyone gets to play a part in a renewable landscape. The less you use the more you can sell. The more energy your farms can grow the more you can sell. Better harvest? More energy!

Business too can benefit from efficiency and new technology. Personal business and smaller operators, local and regional can employ people across any nation and even remotely monitor and managed many of the new technologies available. Brazil's new offshore 170mw turbine array will be monitored in Europe. 

Renewable energy also offers us a chance to finally recycle anything and everything we make and in the process of doing so, create energy not consume it. Toxic landfill that is a waste of space, a pollution pit and an expense to everyone. Most things we have now can be reduced to its base components using fracturing hydrolysis, Syn gas generation and bio composting for massive amounts of readily usable methane (natural gas). If you stuck a car in high pressure cooker the end result would be 40% gases from plastics and rubbers, base oils, paint pigments and metals (copper, zinc, chromium, lead, tin, alumina, gold, nickel, cadmium, magnesium and iron. Most people don't know the embedded energy in the plastics of cars can be extracted to make energy, crushing a car can generate a few kilowatts instead of using it. 

Noe one is doing this yet but it can be done.

We are using the wrong model. We are using a corporate model, the one where you use and toss away. Along the way someone makes money until its buried.

We need a new way where food is energy, energy as its grown (hay to bio fuel or methane) or the waste to methane. The end result is fertiliser. From the farm to house to the factory and back to the farm. From the pit in the ground to endless loops of usage. 

Homes need to be more energy efficient. Homes in colder areas need better insulation, better construction and more efficient heating system based on a standard geo-thermal loop ground coupled energy system.

Solar needs to be standard. Green roofs and garden space above car ports needs to be standard. Water storage under your car port needs to be standard. (A double car car port can store 70,000lts, enough for a year).

Cars need to be at least electric but the town itself should be designed with public transport in mind from the beginning, not as an afterthought.

Every time I see a new pre fab warehouse or small shop go up I think, ""if only they dropped a concrete slab on top too, then someone else could grow food up there"". Millions of acres wasted to heat gathering metal roofs that then in turn heat internally to force the use of air conditioning. Its a massive waste.

Why don't freeways and other reserves have wind turbines on or near them. Why are there no rail lines running down the middle of them?

Why do cities even build more freeways when everyone knows they simply don't work. 

Nuke energy will dominate unless we stop it. They want us, tax payers to prop them up and then they will charge us for it. Fuck no! 

Use your carbon taxes and trading schemes to invest in long term, real energy. create a mix of systems that ensure stability. Stop using the monopoly model pioneered by Westinghouse and GE at the beginning of last century. 

Those wires out the front of your house should be your excuse to invest in solar and so forth. Put into that grid and you make money. Keep sucking from it and you will pay some fat rich asshole even more than they already have.

Hitler knew, for example, that the Soviets in 1941 were already out-producing the Germans in tanks, and they were either catching up, or surpassing the Germans in many other areas.  Looking 5 years down the road, Hitler must have foreseen a power-stalemate with Russia.  At worst, Hitler might've had to face an evenly-matched war of attrition which the Russians would probably win eventually, or, at best, a kind of cold war.

Taking all of this into account, if Hitler wanted to be master of Europe, he had to hit Russia when he did, or else miss losing his last opportunity to do so.  So, IMO, the decision to invade Russia was not stupid, the decision to try to dominate Europe was.

I was just mentioning elsewhere this is the exact same rationale established by Muslim astronomers for not going to a heliocentric model.

&gt; Abu Said al-Sijzi, a contemporary of al-Biruni, suggested the possible heliocentric movement of the Earth around the Sun, which al-Biruni did not reject.[83] Al-Biruni agreed with the Earth's rotation about its own axis, and while he was initially neutral regarding the heliocentric and geocentric models,[84] he considered heliocentrism to be a philosophical problem.[5] He remarked that if the Earth rotates on its axis and moves around the Sun, it would remain consistent with his astronomical parameters:[51]
&gt;
&gt; &gt; ""Rotation of the earth would in no way invalidate astronomical calculations, for all the astronomical data are as explicable in terms of the one theory as of the other. The problem is thus difficult of solution.""

The main reason they wouldn't go for it is because by the 13th century, the focus on science in Islamic civilization had shifted to a position where there was no room left for speculation (a firm scientific tradition had been established). If there weren't enough incentives in the way of predictability and usefulness, there was no point to it. It's not unlike being stuck in one of Kuhn's paradigms. In fact, I recall running into a mention somewhere that Kuhn even pointed out that everyone was stuck within the geocentric paradigm (or it might have been the celestial spheres paradigm) despite all the advancements made.

Those who came closest to changing the status quo:

&gt; Other achievements of the Maragha school include the first empirical observational evidence for the Earth's rotation on its axis by Tusi and Qushji,[15] the separation of natural philosophy from astronomy by Ibn al-Shatir and Qushji,[16] the rejection of the Ptolemaic model on empirical rather than philosophical grounds by Ibn al-Shatir,[92] and the development of a non-Ptolemaic model by Ibn al-Shatir that was mathematically identical to the heliocentric Copernical model.[98]
&gt;
&gt; Mo'ayyeduddin Urdi (d. 1266) was the first of the Maragheh astronomers to develop a non-Ptolemaic model, and he proposed a new theorem, the ""Urdi lemma"".[99] Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī (1201–1274) resolved significant problems in the Ptolemaic system by developing the Tusi-couple as an alternative to the physically problematic equant introduced by Ptolemy.[100] Tusi's student Qotb al-Din Shirazi (1236–1311), in his The Limit of Accomplishment concerning Knowledge of the Heavens, discussed the possibility of heliocentrism. Al-Qazwīnī al-Kātibī (d. 1277), who also worked at the Maragheh observatory, in his Hikmat al-'Ain, wrote an argument for a heliocentric model, though he later abandoned the idea.[83]

And I think one of the reasons why the Maragha astronomers had an easier time parting with tradition was because they belonged to different schools of philosophy and theology. Some were Ismaili, some were Illuminationists (mystics).

I guess it's a matter of picking your poison. Being meticulous and playing it safe means science moving slowly. Being speculative has its obvious drawbacks along with the the potential huge payoff that seems so enticing in hindsight.

My own opinion on the affair is that the atmosphere was very different among Muslim astronomers and European. Though the latter had to deal with the Church, they weren't quite under the same sort of pressure from an existing tradition of thought (""paradigm"") that Muslim astronomers were. At some point, people become hesitant to oppose the brilliant personalities who preceded them, even if they were wrong. They just stop questioning them. This happened in science. It was dealt with by people from different civilizations or traditions picking up where the other left off with a fresh and new spirit of inquiry and criticism.

Similarly, at the outset of the Islamic Golden Age, the Muslim scientists (Alhazen again, I really recommend reading his criticisms of blind imitation in science/philosophy as religious behavior which shouldn't happen outside of religion) didn't behave this way at all. They were scathing towards Ptolemy and the Greeks (as well as what they got from the East).

In other words, I both agree and disagree with your assessment of the Church. I agree in that the Church does seem to have acted in a rational (and reliable) manner, moreso than Galileo. I disagree that this was scientific or scientifically rational. Rationality, reliability, meticulous empirical verification, etc is associated with scientific thought but at some point it's people just stuck in paradigms and not asking new questions. There has to be a certain degree of speculation, even imaginative speculation, without which science becomes completely dependent on political, cultural, and economic factors and is no longer moving to its own beat. The Church would have been plenty rational by not endorsing Galileo on scientific grounds but it had no business censoring him (even censuring would go too far) or interfering with him in any way. It's not simply a matter of falsification, *immediately* predictable results or empirical verification. In my humble opinion, these are the hallmarks of an ingrained (and declining) scientific tradition. Skepticism needs to coexist with healthy speculation in science.

And those pointing out that the Church was blocking the free exchange of ideas need to be careful that they're not simply regurgitating the popular story, because scientific tradition can just as easily impose this limit on its self and everyone will be just fine and dandy going along with it out of some sense of self-idolization (as happened with Islamic astronomy)."

You can also get the regional tickets, which give you unlimited travel (for up to 5 people) within one German state (i.e., Bavaria):

Likewise, most cities have group cards for their metro services. I can only speak confidently for Frankfurt, but we have one here which is approx. 10 euro and is all day for the buses and trains within the Frankfurt area. 

If you hit up Frankfurt, consider going out to Wiesbaden for a day - it's a spa town that is really pretty; it even has a hot springs you can go and visit. Likewise Bad Homburg. Also Aschaffenburg - if you don't have the time to go to somewhere that's really scenic and ""old-German"", the centre of this town is quite pretty, and has some amazing schnitzel.

Ancestral right is bogus, in my view, and is a slippery slope that defies reason.

You are assuming that the Israelis left for hundreds of years only to return on some kind of ancestral recapturing mission.  This is not the case.  Jews have inhabited the area since pre-biblical times in one form or another.  Granted, the same can be said for the people who make up the Palestinian side of the argument, but people seem to make the assumption that, since the Palestinians are the oppressed in this situation, that they must be in the right.  The situation is far more complicated, and the bottom line is that people have been warring in that part of the world for thousands of years.  The Israelis differ from this in two ways:

1) They have had a substantial part of their ethnic group return from other parts of the world over the years.  Keep in mind that this was not by choice, but rather, because the rest of the world said they didn't want them.

2) The Israelis have had a large degree of success in carving themselves out their own little corner of this much-disputed area.  

Why these two things would single Israel out for such harsh criticism, when there are Islamic regimes within one hundred miles that treat their citizens far worse is beyond me.  

&gt; Secondly, mutually beneficial is a wonderfully vague and often highly subjective term. How mutually beneficial were the Aliyahs? Over 350,000 people in a span of 20 years.

I've said before, the rest of the world was not taking Jews.  Where the hell were they supposed to go?  Keep in mind, Jews were trying to escape Nazi influenced Europe by the boatload in the years leading up to WWII, and other countries (including the US) were refusing to accept them simply because they were Jewish, and sending them back to be slaughtered.  What the fuck were Jews supposed to do?  What would you do?  Granted, not all the Aliyahs were as a result of the Nazi regime, but they were all far more popular due to anti-Semitism than for any misguided sense of ""wanting to return home"".  

I'll grant you that you make a compelling point about surrounding nations, but in doing so you've also agreed with my assertion that the situations are far less simple than our initial points might have been.  

The part that frustrates me the most (and I say this as a Jew who is totally against Israel in it's current incarnation) is how people just completely miss the point.  We, as Jews, would have been just fine living around the rest of the world as members of our respective communities.  The rest of the world decided, as a group, that Jews sucked and should GTFO.  So Jews, as a group, did just that, only now everyone is telling them to GTFO of Israel.  It's no wonder so many Jews scream anti-Semitism when someone is critical of Israel.  People have been shitting on Jews, as a group, since their inception as a group.  

The worst part is, with someone like you, who looks up sources and thinks critically, I can explain this and you maybe will understand a little, even if you don't agree.  But for every one person who has actually taken the time to understand the greater socio-historical perspectives of the region, there are fifty idiots like MrMoog who are just content to say ""Teh Jews are teh dumbsauce"".

After all, they became not only the most powerful nation in the world but also the one with unprecedented global power. And that was even in decades before First world war, which was in a way a clear demonstration of US global power. With that in mind, USA were and could not have been outside European or world politics.

With all it's power, the question is, was there a realistic course of action for USA to take, that would deter Axis. I don't much like ""what if"" history, but it still can be a good analytical tool if properly restrained. So, I will assume the same attitudes of European powers, if needed minimally modified in response to what-iffy (technical term) US ones.

Militarily, let's say that US could have crushed pre-Munchen Germany with relative ease and speed. I still don't think such preventive war could have been sold to the domestic public, and if we disregard the fact of democracy in US, I think we start to get too much out of the realm of possible. Britain and France, I think, would not welcome the intervention. They did see the Germany as a danger, but the idea that the war can be avoided was very strong. Also, unconnected to fascist or nazi sympathy as they might or might have not influenced foreign policy, there was a strong opinion that Versailles was, after all, unfair toward Germany. Hitler was, before the war case could have been made, just realising the general principal of national self-determination. For those two reasons, I belive, USA could have not started a preventive war. 

Threat of war, or flexing of the millitary and economical muscle remains as a option. But the above analysis was not unavailable to contemporary actors, so the threat is somewhat discredited from the start. Strong and binding, and not just defensive, alliance with Britain and France might have had a very strong impact, but is faced with the same domestic policy problems as the outright war. Without such alliance, furthermore, I think any threat to Germany from US would remain ineffective. Not for the lack of power, but for the gross underestimation of US power and willingness to fight on the part of Germany. Last point is evidenced by the fact how easy it was for Hitler to declare war on US, even when he had nothing to gain by it.

Maybe the most realistic option would have been to divert a significant part of New deal public spending to arms production, and ship them on credit to Britain and France. It is somewhat plausible as domestic policy and would have an immediate and clear effect on foreign policy of Britain, France and Germany.

tl;dr Stream of tough about the topic, so probably incoherent and ranty. In a nutshell, if ""what if"" analysis remains in the realm of possible, I think US could do little to change the course of events before the war."

I disagree with these premises on their face and it's on you to make some sort of argument that a brutal, warlike empire (which eventually brought about a Dark Age) is inherently superior to one which favors equality and trading endeavors.

&gt;&gt;""All roads led to Rome"" for a reason.
&gt;
&gt;... except those that lead to Constantinople... or Alexandria... or Londinium, etc.

That's a completely ridiculous rebuttal.  Rome was the Hub.  All roads led to Rome because *everything* went through Rome.  The Roman Empire was completely centralized.  The only reason those roads ran to Londinium and other such places was so that the material (and human) wealth of those places could be shipped back to Rome.

You cannot possibly be denying the centralized nature of the Roman Empire.

&gt;Still, it strains credulity to think that the Celts spread over western Europe the way we know they did as well-intentioned, peacenik hippies when they were all the while surrounded by brutal, warring cultures like the Romans, Germans, and Carthaginians.

OK, I don't know how to say this without it coming out as patronizing, so I'm just going to say it:  *you don't know what you're talking about.*

The height of Carthage came and went a couple hundred years before the height of the Celts.  There was *some* overlap, but Carthage was also so far away from the Celtic areas that there wasn't too much chance of them fighting.  And saying ""Germans"" is rather misleading, since it was just a collection of semi-affiliated tribes at this time.  But, again, there is no evidence for warfare, but some records indicating trade.  Nor, for that matter, were the German totally bloodthirsty and warlike - this is, *once again*, Roman propaganda that the Renaissance repeated as fact, and that you are still repeating today.

And as far as Rome goes, the Celts traded with them for hundreds of years with only slight records of border disputes, until one day Rome decided to attack them and take all their gold all at once.  I'm not sure what this proves besides the efficacy of a sufficiently well-prepared sneak attack.

Seriously, you have this idea in your head that Empires only spread by violence.  That's simply not true.   And clinging to it to try to justify your belief that the Celts ""must"" have been the bloodthirsty barbarians the Romans claimed is just starting to look like desperation.  

And look, I can't continue debunking this stuff.  I have other things to do today.  Go read up on the history of his era for yourself, and you'll quit doing things like trying to call Imperial Rome a ""Republic"" or acting like Carthage could have been a threat to the Celts in the time period we're talking about.  I mean, just a couple minutes with the Wikipedia could give you a much better idea of the timelines involved.

So I leave you to your research.  I hope you'll actually continue looking into this, but I suspect you'll just go right back to saying the same things you have here.  Either way, have a nice day."

In suggesting that La Liga is likely to be a two-horse race for the forseeable future, I'm not making any claims about Barcelona's ability to put together a side that works the way they do now.  Barcelona and Real will, however, always be able to put together a side the way Real has now; all that takes is money.  Money is the reason - the *only* reason - that the Premier League is probably the world's best; money is the reason the top Premier League sides are where they are, one and all.  No one is in the top four - or even competing to be the in top four - who didn't buy their places.  Barcelona's justly famous for its youth academy, but it would be silly to deny that their current side is more than simply home-grown talent; they built it by splashing out huge sums when necessary, and when their current team begins to flag the money will be there to shore up any holes.

Financial fair play is going to demand that teams pay for their activities, using the money they make from their activities.  TV and merchandising revenues are counted among that revenue, so financial fair play isn't going to change anything that I've said.  The sides primarily affected by that change are sides like Man City or to some extent Chelsea or Spurs, who are where they are due to huge cash infusions that are not recouped by the club's normal activities.  Barca and Real make money hand over fist, out of all proportion with any other Spanish clubs, and as I said recent changes in policy are tending to entrench that, not remedy it.

Financial disparities don't make victory automatic, at least not at first; left unchecked, however, these financial gaps will tend only to grow wider, and when your income has a couple zeroes on any of your competitors they are not going to unseat you.  If anything it's your initial example of the Bundesliga that implements this best; having implemented something *approaching* financial parity, they have one of Europe's most balanced and competitive leagues.  Spain is taking very deliberate steps to create precisely the opposite.

EDIT: My remarks about the EPL should take Arsenal into account.  They're also justly famous for their youth system and their astonishing moderation in recent transfer windows.  I suspect, however, that they have every penny they need to hang onto their best players."

I could defend this nation from invasion and attack for as little as $20 billion a year. It might be closer to $10 billion, it's not easy to read this crap, and some of what I'd need to know is classified. And when I say I could defend it, I would mean that no nation would be capable of invading the US, either the mainland or Hawaii or other territory, and that no nation could attack us without suffering immediate repercussions. 

We would be unable to invade other nations (this is a good thing, in my opinion). We wouldn't be able to do the nation-building thing... Libya would be on its own, or at the very least Europe would have to do that crap if they wanted it. We would have to reconcile ourselves to the idea that if some Nazi-like power emerged and sent an invasion fleet against us, that we would nuke it at sea.

But, I could reduce the defense budget thirtyfold or more, without making us vulnerable.

In a place where they were a minority. How do you feel about creating a Mexican state in Texas? After all, it used to be Mexican.

&gt;What the Jews tried and intended to create is a state that has a Jewish majority but where the non-Jewish minority has equal national and personal rights. 

Of course they accepted it. They were immigrants who took the best deal they got. That doesn't make it any less immoral.

&gt;The plan did not require anyone to be expelled from their homes and provided for the rights of the Arab minority in the Jewish state and the jewish minority in the Arab state.

And yet the Israelis had no problem expelling the Arabs, and Ben Gurion was speaking of population transfers some time before the partition plan.

&gt;Also, the only real connection between the Palestinian refusal to accept Israel's right to exist and the Nakba, is that the refusal is what caused the Nakba in the first place.

The refusal was on a very solid basis - you do not increase your presence in a country from 9% to 33% in just 22 years and then expect people to go ""here you go"". The Europeans are a lot more pissed off today about a much, much smaller number of immigrants.

The refusal was because it prejudiced the right of Palestinians to self-determination, and handed many Palestinian cities - and some of the most fertile land in Palestine - to what is essentially a state for foreign immigrants.

&gt; Same thing goes for all the claims that Israel's occupation of the west bank is the root cause of the conflict. If that was true then there would not have been a conflict before 1967.

Nobody claims it is the root of it. It is, however, the biggest barrier to peace today and that is undeniable.

&gt;I think what the Palestinians need to do is to learn from the Germans. You don't exactly see any Germans in the Sudetenland anymore, but they are not denying the right of the Czech republic to exist. Why? I think there are two reasons. First, the Germans have internalized that starting WWII was the wrong thing to do. Second, demanding that millions of Sudeten Germans be allowed to return to Sudetenland is not something that the Czech republic will ever agree to and would likely start a war.

Wow... the irony of this is astounding. You do realize that you have things the wrong way around, right? The Israelis are the ones who moved into territory that wasn't theres and settled there. They formed a minority and yet they demanded their own state based on having had a presence there 2,000 years ago. Anti-semitism in Europe definitely played a role, but the Palestinians were in no shape or form responsible for it.

As for us ""internalizing that what we did was wrong"", we were the ones who were expelled. We are the ones who most of our country. Just how brainwashed are you? 

&gt;But this is just wishful thinking on my part. There is absolutely zero chance that the Palestinians will ever admit that the whole ""lets throw the jews into the sea"" thing back in 1948 was both a bad idea and immoral.

How fucking ironic. It is the Palestinians who were thrown in the sea - quite literally, and some twice, first in Jaffa and then in Acre and Haifa where they had taken refuge - and you want us to apologize for something that never happened and for bullshit which is the product of a very well oiled propaganda machine? Spare me.

&gt;As for the ""massive immigration"" issue that you brought up. It is true that much of the Jewish population growth was due to immigration. But so what? Was there no arab immigration into palestine as well? Why should an arab have a right to immigrate into palestine/israel, but not a Jew? How many palestinians have the surname al-masri? Should they all be deported to egypt?

The Queen of England is of German descent. The Americans are a mish mash of many, many nationalities. Does that mean they shouldn't have population controls?

The Jews formed a small minority of Palestine in the early 1920s. Allowing regular immigration is one then, but tens of thousands of Jews immigrating with the purpose of creating a state over land that wasn't free for the taking is wrong however you look at it. It is colonization, plain and simple.

Palestine is Arab. Arabs were only split into nation states in the 20th century - there is a common Arab identity, and there is a huge distinction between Arabs moving in Arab lands and European Jews moving to Arab land to create a state. Again, that is known as colonialism; it isn't occuring with the conesent of the indigenous people.

Unless you think democracy and the opinion of a population only counts when it is in favour of your cause. 

Fact is, had the circumstances occurred anywhere else in the world they would never have been accepted as legitimate. "

Stop playing the victim card - WWII ended long ago, and no Jew is prosecuted in Europe or the Americas today. Why did the Jews not demand that those countries that harmed most directly - Germany, Austria, etc. - care for them properly and give them a state on their own land instead of moving to a country that wasn't there's for the taking?

No. There is nothing in art. 22 that makes Palestine a state.

&gt; Well you did, but you previously skirted that it wasn't a state because it lacked certain properties. You also volunteered that they had their own borders, their own flag, their own political offices, their own currency...I just led you to it.

No. None of these things existed before the Mandate. All of these things were created by the Mandate.

&gt; You've gone from saying they weren't a state because of a British Administration to now accepting that under the LoN that is evidence of a state but that absence of other things, which you volunteer yourself, as evidence.

No. That's not what I said.

&gt; It won't make sense if you don't read the covenant of the LoN. In article 22 it makes clear of state recognition on condition. The condition being that the states accept mandate.

No, there is no such language in art. 22. I have read the Covenant, and many of the treaties.

&gt; A state's recognition relied on accepting an administrator, not an administrator being present as argument of it not being a state: something which you just argued.

No, I argued that it was not a state for reasons that have nothing at all to do with LoN covenant.

&gt; Your actual words were: ""The language of the Mandate said no such thing as 'nothing was to be done against the indigenous people,' it is your frivolous interpretation that has no legal merit.

No, my actual words were ""The language of the Mandate said no such thing as ""nothing was to be done against the indigenous people,"" it is your frivolous interpretation that has no legal merit. In reality, the Mandate says that nothing shall be done **by the mandatory Power** to impinge upon **civil and religious rights** of existing occupants"". 

The part that you chose to remove means two things: a) that the obligation was on Britain, not on the Jews b) that neither civil nor religious rights of the Palestinians include ethnic exclusivity

&gt; Only the text of the mandate disagrees with you; and even you disagreed with you, acknowledging that Palestinian political offices were set up under the Mandate.

I didn't deny that they were. My point was that there weren't any BEFORE the Mandate, which is an indication that Palestine was not a state, and that those that were set up during the Mandate were in every sense inferior to the mandatory government, again indicating that Palestine was not a state. 

&gt; Strikes me the preference was that ""nothing should be done which might prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine.""

Correct. And civil/religious rights did not include limits on Jewish immigration. That is a privilege only sovereign states can assert, by virtue of controlling the borders, something that Palestinians did not do, and Britain had no right to do because that'd contravene the primary purpose of the Mandate.

&gt; Not by some Jewish immigration, but changing a demographic from 85% Arab to 80% Jewish, predominantly European, does change the civil dynamic and culture. 

Which was acceptable.

&gt; Which is why under the mandate the administrator announced they'd stop it before it reached 20%, which even so was considerable.

And they had no right to do so.

&gt; Oh as administrators they very much did have authority and not only did they practice it, the Jewish Palestinian population adhered to it. When they applied for an extra 10,000 Britain took the Kindertransport to the UK themselves. They didn't want to see Jewish children persecuted but they didn't allow them to break the Mandate either.

So tens of thousands of ""illegal"" jewish immigrants did not happen. Internment camps didn't exist. Jews weren't thrown into Cyprus. Bravo.

&gt; You've already accepted that the plight of the indigenous population was deemed far from irrelevant - it's in the covenant, the mandate, the declaration. You deem it irrelevant, not the same thing.

No. The protections you allude to did not include the right of exclusion.

&gt; What I am interested to know is why you (because clearly the LoN didn't consider it so) consider that ""ALL JEWISH PEOPLE have an irrevocable, unconditional right of settlement in Palestine""?

Because that is the fact of history, fact of international law, and because we have, are and will fight to death to defend this right."

The US tries to suppress insurgents by a tactic called ""hearts and minds"" to make the civilian population stop fearing them, but the russians do not have to care about international condemnation and New York Times articles, so they decided that fear through boundless cruelty is the best way to stop insurgents, a tactic they named '[bespredel](http://articles.latimes.com/2000/sep/17/news/mn-22524)'.

Perhaps as many as 10% of the total population of the country was killed (for comparison estimates for Iraq are about 0.5%). At the conclusion of major hostilities there wasn't a single undamaged house left in the capitol Grozny.

THAT is the most brutal conflict to occur on European soil since World War II.

It didn't really get much better after.

Gainax ran into some monetary troubles, which is partly why the last two episodes are the ending that takes places in Shinji's head (flashbacks, reused cels). The movie has the ending as it happens in the outside world.

Rebuild is 4 movies, with the first 2 already completed in 2007 and 2009. The material from the TV series is compressed (and partially changed) to fit the events into the shorter time frame.

Palestine is not Arab. Palestine is not even Palestine. Palestine is the name the Romans gave to Judea in their ultimatley futile attempt to sever the Jewish connection to the land. 

This is not to say that Arabs have no claim to Palestine. They do. Its just not exclusive. Arabs have to share it with the Jews, because the Jews have as much right to it, as much history and connection to it as the Arabs. 

If you see no issue with an Arab from Morocco moving to an Arab land, then what is wrong with an Jew from Morocco or Russia or wherever moving to Jewish land? 

The entire basis of your argument is that the Jews are foreigners, that they are colonialists, etc. I reject this notion. The Jews have as much right to move there, to live there, and to seek self-determination as any Arab. 

Also, your claim that the Palestinians rejected the partition plan because it prejduced Palestinian self-determination is wrong. There would still have been a Palestinian state with a Palestinian majority that could ruyle itself how ti saw fit. This in addition to Jordan, where there is, and always was, a population that is majority ethnically Palestinian. And the parititon plan the Palestinian minority in the Jewish state would have had complete cultural, linguistic and religious autonomy, in addition to having all the regualr rights of citizens. 

And your claim that the partition plan would have denied Palestinians the most fertile areas makes no sense. None of the Palestinians who were living in those fertile areas would have had to go anywhere. 

As for the history surrounding the Nakba, I frankly don't understand how you can deny that the Arabs tried to destory Israel. It is a historical fact that as soon as Israel declared independence it was invaded by armies from 5 (6?) arab countries. Even before that the local Palestinians were actively attacking Jewish towns and villages. 

It is true that Palestinians are not responsible for European anti-semitism, but that is not what I claimed when I brought up the example of the Sudetenland. The Palestinian/Arab wrong is their attmept to destory Israel because ""Palestine is Arab."" 

The Arabs do have to internalize that Palestine is NOT exclusively Arab. That the Jews have a right to live there and to seek self-determination, and that the war to create an Arab Palestine was immoral and (at least) a partial cause of the subsequent Nakba. The other thing you need to learn from the Germans is that if you want peace now, then you have to recognize the right to exist of the people you are making peace with. If Germany did not recognize the right of the Czech republic to exist because after WWII the Czechs kicked out the Sudeten Germans then there would definetley not be peace, let alone any type of diplomatic relations, between Germany and the Czech Republic. 

Imagine a Palestine where arabs and jews live in peace, where no palestinians lost their homes and lands because of war, where there is freedom, democracy, civil rights, and a thriving economy. That is the Palestine that could have been, that is the palestine that was lost when the Arab rejected the UN Parititon Plan in the name of an exclusivley Arab Palestine. "

Let's face it - you're not going to b able to live in the closet, and homosexuality is pretty much fixed (some genetic markers, some environmental triggers, some issues with embryonic development, but suffice to say, its fixed, you'll be turned on by guys [assuming you're a guy], and denying that will lead to a world of tragedy). 

Take solace in the fact that:

* You are not alone, not just that there are other gay people out there, but other gays with righteous parents. 
* Homosexuality (even homosexual pair-bonding) exists in a multitude of species, and is highly correlated with pro-social species such as bonobo chimps and many bird species. By contrast, species that have harems and violent punishment for males who aren't alpha, like lions, seals and gorillas exhibit very little homosexuality and a world of pain. 
* The world is coming around to homosexuality. The EU and Canada already guarantee pretty much the same rights for gays as straights, and the U.S. is slowly catching up. 
* You are growing up with the Internet - man, you have no idea how lonely it was before then, especially in a small town. I know it doesn't feel like that now, but trust me, you will easily be able to find support (like us here at reddit) where I could only find a single newspaper at the library.

But most important - you can't change how your parents think. Love them, let them live in ignorance, don't bother with biblical debates as they are inherently non-rational. Just let it slide and over time they will either grow to accept and love or be poisoned by silver tongued preachers, but you will not be able to debate your way into their hearts. So have patience, give them space, grow up, get educated, be strong and healthy (in mind and body) and you'll do just fine.

All in all, it was a fantastic experience, but I didn't get a sleeper car, and I was hurting, and smelling pretty ripe by the end of the journey. Not to mention, the overall quality of train travel in the US is sub-par to that of Europe. 

The highlight for me was the scenery through the Rockies, but the whole trip was very beautiful to watch pass by through the window.

As far as the trains running on time, Amtrak has gotten much better about this, though, it's not by their own doing. I talked to a conductor about it on my trip, and he reasoned, ever since the US economy took a dive, there has been far less freight traffic on the tracks, making it much easier for passenger trains to run on schedule.

I think you'd be more happy driving, however, just because the of the freedom you'd be granted to stop and take a look around, chose your route, etc. I would look heavily into how much of a budget difference it would be. Also, you could look into ride sharing.

If you do go the train route, I recommend going to your local Asian market, and stocking a bag full of food items that you can make by just adding hot water. Dehydrated miso soup, numerous noodles, etc — they did my right on my trip. You can get free hot water from the concession stand on board, you just may want to leave a little tip if you're doing it often. Also, the breakfast is superior to the dinner meals on board, but pretty much all the food is a little nasty. I believe, most of it is just microwaved. 

And one last word of advice for the train, and this one, take heed of. Several Amtrak cars are not up to date with power outlets. Some cars will only have one row with a jack for power. If you travel with ANY tech, you are going to want to claim that seat. Just be ready for being bugged by everyone on the train wanting to use your coveted power outlet.

           This is to provide you with our analysis of whether the President, acting without specific statutory authorization, lawfully may introduce United States ground troops into Bosnia and Herzegovina (""Bosnia"") to help the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (""NATO"") ensure compliance with the recently negotiated peace agreement. We believe that the President may act unilaterally in the circumstances here.

I. Background

           The United States has a large stake in helping to secure the Bosnian peace agreement. The United States has a firm commitment to the principle that the security and stability of Europe are of fundamental interest to the United States. As the President stated, if the negotiations fail and the war resumes, there is a very real risk that it could spread beyond Bosnia, and involve Europe's new democracies as well as our NATO allies.

           Although the involvement of the United Nations in the Bosnian conflict can be traced back to at least 1991, the United Nations first deployed the United Nations Protection Force (""UNPROFOR"") in the former Yugoslavia in April 1992. Most of the troops in UNPROFOR have been provided by nations allied with the United States under the NATO Treaty

What makes one a Jew? From my understanding being a Jew is being a descendant of those who have been practicing Judaism for thousands of years. Jews tend to have similar qualities because of there adherence to the culture stemming from Judaism over thousands of years. I do not understand how one can honestly say they are a Jew and simply brush off all of the traditions that their ancestors have been doing for thousands of years. Due to modern society it is very hard to put it into perspective that your family has been doing essentially everything a certain way for thousands of years. I know that many people can not even trace there genealogy/heritage/ancestry but if you look Jewish and think you are it is probably because if you could go back a couple centuries in your family history you would then see a history that is, generally speaking, everyone (in your family history prior to a few centuries ago) adhering to their culture (being Jewish) for thousands of years. I understand that there has been a lot of changes in the past few centuries with the mindset of everyone going from local to global along with the technology to travel over vast distances and due to that some people have ancestry that comes from all over the world and is not just unique to being Jewish, for example the rapper Drake is half African-American and half Jewish-Canadian so he would have thousands of years of African heritage from his father's side and the Jewish heritage from his mother's side which prior to European expansionism (Europe Asia Africa exploring Americas and the world resulting in a global consciousness) remained relatively the same for thousands of years. So I would ask of you to open your mind a bit and just revel in the greatness of Jewish heritage and culture and to truly appreciate the time and effort your ancestors put in to keeping it alive for thousands of years. Please do not be so naive as to simply brush all of this off because of the advent of atheism which will over the course of centuries destroy the Jewish identity or any and all identities that have been around for thousands of years. And if you knew your history you would know that Jews have not had their own nation for thousands of years. And they have not had their own nation because it contradicts what it is to be a Jew according to the Torah for thousands of years."

I grew up over there and I just graduated from an American college. If you've looking into this and talking to your advisor and the possiblity is there, do not hesitate. Like others have said, you will hugely regret passing this up.

Germany is a good choice because it's centrally located in Europe, it makes getting around to the other countries awesome. The key thing here is that it basically doesn't matter how good your German is, because most Germans are half decent at English, even if they think they aren't you can still understand them. If you stay with a family, you will be golden. Most schools will have families that sign up to host you, and they usually have ones with German college students and they will take you by the hand and guide you.

If your advisor tells you it's possible, do it. Worry about the paperwork later. Either way, if he/she gives you the go ahead, I'd say they are responsible for making sure it works out and pack your bags.

When you get thrown into a situation where all you hear is in German, all you read and have to understand and say is in German, your skill of the language will improve exponentially. I really hope you get to go. I grew up in Bavaria, so of course I'm going to say Munich rocks with their cocks out.

By next level I just meant 'something new', like a  new dimension to the game.  I don't want some tangent addition (like game developers do so often).  I think adding the ability to design your own world (or your own campaign map for that matter) would add the extra dimension I desire. 

For instance, if I could lengthen Japan to include 50% more land mass, and make the campaign that much more epic, I would.  I'd love to have like 2 japan-sized islands, where a sea lies between both of them...  So when you conquer your island (basically all of modern sized Japan) you'd need to research seafarer and explore that new island.  Maybe that island is way behind yours, and you conquer it easily.  Maybe that new island has much more advanced weaponry and has an alliance across all of the territories...  And by exploring there they now want to conquer YOU.  Or you develop seafarer technology early on, and reach that other island with matchlock guns from Europe...  The scenarios are endless and could be a lot of fun to not know exactly what will unfold.  My favorite aspects of Shogun has always been the map play, even more than the tactical side of the game.  If the map was extended and customizable I'd love it.

ASL is just as complicated and advanced as any other language. There is nothing you can talk about in any language on earth, that you can not talk about using ASL. 

The thing about ASL is that there is no Sign-to-English word for word translation for every word in the English language; some words don't have signs, and also some signs mean different things in different contexts. I feel that is where people get that idea that ASL is in some way a lesser, or more rudimentary form of communication.. The fact is that it is simply communication minus sound. Context, body language, facial expression, and use of space around you, on top of using the actual signs is how you communicate using Sign. ASL doesn't sound like english bc it isn't english. It's ASL. It's about context and body language, not so much the lexicon. Yes it is important to define things and to have individual signs, and there is a huge huge lexicon of signs. But what good is a sign without context? That's where hearing people get the idea that it would be harder to communicate with sign.. But really, body language is just like sound for your eyes, if you're Deaf. It is in the usage of those other components of communication that people communicate with sign.

In ASL, the structure of your sentences goes, TIME-TOPIC-COMMENT.

so, ""My friend and I went to the movies on Tuesday"" in ASL, would be, ""TUESDAY-MY FRIEND-ME-GO-MOVIE""

This is called ""Glossing"" and it essentially is how you would write sentences in ASL. Just write the signs you are signing. 
Now.
In this sentence, the person signing would be using the body language/spatial aspect of ASL to signify that the Tuesday in the convo is the Tuesday that has just passed. Reading it, it looks like a rudimentary language, but the thing is, it is only written this way bc those are the signs you are going to use.
""I want to go to Europe next month.""
In ASL, ""NEXT-MONTH-EUROPE-I-WANT-GO""  
However, in context, the people signing aren't sitting there saying and interpreting these things like cavemen, they're saying the same thing we are: ""My friend and I went to the movies on Tuesday."" ""I want to go to Europe next month."" It's just, the time and the topic establish the context for the entire conversation, so that is why they are at the beginning instead of the end. It's the way you sign it, with your body language and space that gives you the information about the sign, as I've said too many times now (sorry). Just as the way you say the word ""dude"" can be interpreted to mean all sorts of crap.
Learning sign, at first, is difficult for that reason. People want it to be straight up English with hands, and when one sign, in different contexts can mean different things, that can be difficult, and hard to understand, especially if you aren't an animated person, or you don't really use a lot of body language in your daily life.

May be you want to present different problems?


(You know, I'm not sure if islam is meant to be the only thing the world over - personally I think it seems to do better when there is something juxtaposed to it.)

As for solving the world's problems, there is the belief that like pollen it will eventually spread the world over - so i guess yeah you're right most of the solution it's supposed to have are assuming its put in place in some form in order to try and solve said problems.


**But anyway, just for arguments sake:**  one of the basic ideals islam sets out is *embetterment* (for lack of a better word).  At it's most zen-like it sees that people remove arrogance and selfishness from their hearts and replace it with equality, humility and selflessness.  Obviously, there are so many problems in this world this pacificity can help alleviate. 

But of course with such pacifism comes a very real danger of what I call, **""expanding the grey area""**.  That is, if people are so forgiving and humble as to let slide the prostitute and the murderer and every other wrong doer, we're going to have a real problem here. What will happen to our definition of justice and the rule of law?  Basically, society will slip into a another malaise where people are no longer adherents to the principal tenets of the faith and thus are no different than every other messed up society that has come and gone. (Yes some societies have done better than others, but on average most of many shortcomings).

That's where *practice* (islam) comes in.  It's the other 1/3 of islamic philosophy (the famous one) that sets some hard lines like don't murder or sell your body or do wrongs or there should be punishment; do do this or try to avoid that, etc. Its elastic enough to allow the occasional pardon - but strong enough that it's not stretched into accepting everything.  

Islam seems to have a real fear of **'widening acceptance of everything'** leading to a moral collapse of society.  With practice it wants to keep things on the straight and narrow in order to perpetuate the society.  


Look at *America* today. If I were to draw graphs of societal levels of embetterment, well the US and Europe would be off the charts and the Mid East would be way behind.  America has allowed us to live in one of those few moments in human history where so many of the best things humanity has to offer are available at once.  


We are currently in the midst of a special era in our history that only a few other nations have pushed and escalated to, *just before they fell off the cliff...*

I am a gay (about to be married) man, who lives in Canada with my partner. We've been together for about 4 years now, and we have discussed the children issue. We both REALLY want kids, and we both want biological children, so we've agreed to have two biological children via a surrogate (one using his sperm, the other using mine) and then to adopt a couple more kids (He's eastern European, I'm Indian/mixed descent so we come from cultures that adore BIG families).

We're both in our mid20s and as such, we still have a lot of friends that do not have children that have bravely volunteered to either donate eggs, or allow us to ""rent their uterus"" as our surrogate. I understand that surrogacy is no-where as intimate as contributing genetically to the child, however the egg-donation offers are. 

Both my fiance and I agree that this would be a bad idea. Since it would mean that our children would have direct access to someone who could technically be though of as a parent by the child: either the egg donor, or the surrogate. 

We both agree that this could lead to anything from random attachment by our friend/egg donor to OUR child, or the child becoming strangely attached to the surrogate. 

I frankly think that for the good of both your friend and yourself, you should avoid this situation.

Good servers, in my opinion, are servers where people use Mumble a lot: Tactical Gamer (North America), Noobs With Attitudes/NwA (Europe) and PR Teamwork Alliance/PRTA (Europe, Mumble is required or you'll get kicked if the server is full). The 116-slot test server also currently requires Mumble but it's filled with people who don't have mics or who aren't interested in teamwork (but it's still a fun experience to play with almost double the players).

Mumble (PR edition) is a program that allows you to talk any teammate within 40m or so with positional audio (if someone to your left speaks, you'll only hear it in your left speaker) and allows squad leaders to communicate with each other easily (instead of going through the commander, in most public games there aren't any commanders anyway). 

It's extremely useful for coordination between players who aren't in the same squad (because in-game VOIP only works in the same squad): you can point out enemies to teammates, ask an APC or chopper driver to bring you somewhere, etc, without using the chat system (which is pretty limited since only 4 lines can appear at a time). Also very useful to help guide the medic to your body so he can revive you.

&gt;So you think that Israel has the right to set its laws? And you think it was right and moral to say to people trying to flee extermination ""too bad, we don't like your kind here"".

Israel at this point is entrenched enough that its utterly fraudulent genesis is trumped by inertia; so yes I believe that Israeli laws to the extent that they don't continue to abuse the native Palestinians, are legit. Your point about people trying to flee extermination is sympathetic, but undermined by the fact that Zionist colonization of Palestine began in the late 1800's well before WW2. 

&gt;Are you unaware that most Jews were secular or are you uninterested in looking at the facts? And should Israelis be free of threat of assassination? Or do the Palestinians have the right to kill them?

My recollection is that most of the early Zionists immigrants were religious, but organized by secularists. I think everyone should be free from the threat of assassination, but Israel is the world leader in political assassination, and Palestine is kept so downtrodden that they cant even aim rockets properly, so comparing the two is outrageous.

&gt;You have a great mind for knowing bad things about Jews.

Odd. IIRC, personal responsibility is an old-testament (meaning: primitive) value, and it is used pretty much by everyone who screws others but wants to sleep at night, so they rationalize that by invoking personal responsibility to blame their victims…

&gt; I mean, we basically begged for pogroms, the blood libels were a big lol, and the I guess the holocaust must have been our fault. Great thinking, I can't believe I never thought of before.

How about the ghettoes pretty much about all over Europe? How about the shtetls all over Eastern Europe?

I should have been clearer. The problem that you have to have a national debate on whether it is ok to torture or not. There is a pretty wide consensus in the west that torture is a crime. I know there are a lot if Americans that care deeply. The problem is that many don't, and some even support it. This is not a attack on you or your friends personal integrity, its an attack on the total democratic results of the  308,745,538 people that live in the US.

&gt;Just my state has 37 million people, and we're neither war mongering, nor the fat, uneducated stereotype that foreigners like to imagine us as....I don't meet someone who ignorantly tells me that America is a place of ignorant, uncaring people.

You are defending against a stereotype I never put on you, by generalizing what you seemingly percive to be the rest of the worlds opinion of Americans.

You accuse me of generalizations, and proceed to pummel me with two generalizations and a stereotype.. Do you see the irony? :P

&gt;All of these situations have been addressed and the US government has tried to put a stop to it.

No, the kill team drama was in more than one platoon. When something happens in several platoons within the same company, it is highly unlikely that the company commmander does not know as knowing this kind of shit is his job. The low level players get prosecuted, but the men in charge get away with it. The same happend when the Abu Ghraib scandal unflolded. They are basically treating the symptomes, not the cause. So a few pesants are sacrificed to sate the public outcry for justice(That is well and good, but it does not solve the problem). In some cases they even have the gall to try and cover it up and hush it down.

&gt;However, we're a young country, and I feel that we are maturing. 

The US as a nation has plenty of history. It just seems it is forgotten or ignored all the time.

Gone is the financial lessons learned from the roaring twenties, so is the lessons learned from nationbuilding in Europe after WW2.  Even the painful lessons from Vietnam seem forgotten, Christ! This is not mateuring, this is turning senile.

I'd argue that the vast majority of our spending at a higher rate comes from unhealthy lifestyle choices, the restriction of interstate competition, political rules requiring the provision of unnecessary coverage, and the extreme influence the AMA holds over various medical licensing processes.
And of course, there's the potential that Americans spend more because they want more. Also not factored into your analysis is the fact that many (if not all) European countries pay for a lot of health care via deficit spending, which has unaccounted for interest.

And of course, there's the potential that Americans spend more because they want more. Also not factored into your analysis is the fact that many (if not all) European countries pay for a lot of health care via deficit spending, which has unaccounted for interest.

We can see that [health care costs across the first world have been rising at about the same rate](http://i.imgur.com/S938w.png), (although I'm sure you can expect it to jump in the wake of the PPACA), and this indicates that the USA has no inherent problem with holding down costs.

In addition, the data that indicates Medicare is more efficient administratively is very sketchy because the government can push administrative costs onto doctors and patients (the same way they do with the tax code). For example, a physician's staff spends an entire hour handling a single Medicare claim on average. Mark Litow estimated these hidden costs and found that Medicare and Medicaid spend 26.9 cents for every dollar of benefits, compared to 16.2 cents spent by private insurance.

There are numerous other datasets that show the superiority of the (admittedly flawed) American healthcare system. [Americans spend more time with their doctors](http://imgur.com/VQJJC), [have better access to dialysis and coronary surgeries](http://i.imgur.com/rDG4S.png), [have more MRIs and CTs](http://i.imgur.com/vROVq.png), [get non-emergency surgery much more quickly](http://i.imgur.com/PqRda.png), and survive [prostate](http://i.imgur.com/dmRx2.png) and [breast](http://i.imgur.com/As6Nf.png) cancer much more often then their single payer counterparts.

In addition, the american elderly are generally much more satisfied with care. The annual rate of cancer deaths is 70 percent higher in the United Kingdom than in the United States.

The worst part is that single-payer systems often don't even succeed in the one area they are universally expected to: providing equal access to health care. The British government commissioned two studies (The Black Report and The Acheson Report), which found that health care access, if anything, had become *less equal* then before the NHS was instituted. [Canada's health care is unreasonably focused on urban areas](http://i.imgur.com/P0YFp.png).

Single payer systems are notoriously bad at allocating resources. More than one million people are waiting to be admitted to NHS hospitals, but the equivalent of 1,692 full-time doctors are tied up waiting for patients who do not appear for appointments or call to cancel. If the NHS did nothing more than charge patients the full costs of missed appointments, it would free up enough money to treat thousands of additional cancer patients each year. Yet doing so is not seriously considered. British “patients” take between 18 million and 19 million ambulance rides each year—about one ride for every three people in Britain. Almost 80 percent of these rides are for such nonemergency purposes as taking an outpatient to a hospital or a senior to a pharmacy and amount to little more than free taxi service. While thousands of people die each year from lack of kidney dialysis, the NHS provides an array of comforts for chronically ill people with less serious health problems.

Ask yourself, do you really want your health care run by the George Bushes of the world? The most recent example of single payer failure that I've heard; the NHS has been refusing smokers certain treatments on the basis that they tax the system, even though the data shows that smokers on average use less healthcare then non-smokers.

Why anyone would look at the complete irrationality and corruption of the electoral process and then decide to hand medicine to the goons in Washington is beyond me.

Instead of acknowledging that flies do have antibiotic substances on their bodies and that an illiterate merchant claiming to be a prophet from the desert of Arabia 1400 years ago knew this, you're saying you want exact confirmation that a specific procedure of dipping the fly in a certain exact mixture will have any effect on bacteria.

That research doesn't exist yet. All this experiment has done is show that the antibiotic substance does exist. Their goal does not seem to be to try and extract it by dipping into water. Rather, they drowned the fly in ethanol and filtered what remained to isolate the extract. This procedure confers reasonable confidence in the assumption that the antibiotic substance discovered on the surface of the fly can be absorbed into a liquid in which the fly is introduced to.

Or you can wait for the research to be done whenever someone happens to do it.

You also seem to be under the assumption that this hadith conveys any injunction. It's the prophet's own opinion, whether aided by divine inspiration or otherwise. Take it or leave it. It isn't a commandment. Thus, for me personally, my faith on Islam doesn't hinge on scientific research into flies.

Neither, it seems, did the faiths of Ibn Khatima and Ibn Khatib. Two 14th century Andalusian (Spanish) Muslim scientists who discovered that the Black Plague which had been afflicting Europe was caused by tiny disease producing agents (contagions, ""germs"").

It seems that this well known hadith of Bukhari doesn't really have a problem with science."

So, as to the question, how does complexity arise, it's more, how is one form of complexity exchanged for another. A decrease in morphological complexity, for example a loss of cases, can be prompted by phonological change collapsing multiple cases together, leading speakers to adopt other strategies for conveying that information, e.g. adpositions or word order. Morphological complexity can increase, for example addings cases, in an opposite fashion, with adpositions affixing to nouns.

I think Europe, Canada, and Australia can get a little self-richeous about critiquing the US - but the reality is that they're only marginally better in terms of sustainability and a little less war hawkish.  With all their resources (more than the US), they haven't exactly made the world outside the EU a better place... they're complacent in world conflicts (didn't even intervene in neighboring Kosovo's genocide until the US spearheaded it) and just as dependent on 3rd world resources.

European countries are tolerant but the other side is not, and will not stop short of instituting backward laws in place that enforce their world view. Talk to any honest Muslim out there and they will tell you that western society is incompatible with their religion and that their goal is to mold it to adopt parts or whole Sharia law. And attempts have been made to do that in various countries in the EU and here in Canada (my new home land). Fortunately, they are failing but it is not impossible to imagine a future where they do succeed, more likely to first happen in Europe, esp. more liberal and tolerant societies like Scandinavian countries, or ones with large Muslim populations like UK and France.

Prior to WWI a lot of European artists and intellectuals held similar views to the futurists, believing that a major European war would lay the foundations for a new society and a better future. I guess it's hard for us to imagine how they could have this essentially romanticizing view with the hindsight afforded to us by WWI &amp; WWII. 

One interesting case is Otto Dix. Although not a Futurist he held a lot of the same views, but abandoned these after serving in WWI. After the war ended and he ended up painting decidedly [unromantic depictions of his war experiences](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_3-K2c2hH5ws/TQc3vPMid_I/AAAAAAAAAe4/PsvxphjHCOw/s1600/Dix%2B-%2BDer%2BKrieg%252C%2B1929-32.jpg), often shocking the German public, which still in many cases held a very romanticising view of war or just didn't want to see this sort of violence depicted. Interestingly, his paintings became important for the pacifism movement despite Dix himself not being a pacifist at all. He apparently once told a friend that was trying to convince him to join the german communist part that ""sticking a bayonet in someone’s guts and twisting it around” was a much more satisfying activity than politics. Yet when WWII came around he could see that a lot of the same mistakes where being committed and was opposed to the war. Although very privately as he'd already made himself unpopular with the nazis. 

The interesting thing about the futurists though is that despite the destruction of WWI they still managed to revive the movement in the 20's and 30's. Not all that surprising I guess if you consider that another war was about to be started by Germany, people again taking to ideas very similar to the ones that where popular leading up to WWI. I guess it goes to show how art often mirrors society. Although it makes you wonder how a movement that was so closely related to fascism [managed to produce some truly beautiful work](http://www.artchive.com/artchive/f/futurist/unique.jpg).  "

Lie.
      Certain communities formerly belonging to the Turkish
      Empire have reached a stage of development where their
      existence as independent nations can be provisionally
      recognized subject to the rendering of administrative 
      advice and assistance by a Mandatory until such time
      as they are able to stand alone. The wishes of these
      communities must be a principal consideration in the
      selection of the Mandatory.

We know from the mandate and from Transjordan which was technically the same mandate, with only River Jordan division agreed on ratification, that Palestine was such a community and recognised as a State.  Even the mandate refers to Palestine self governance and government.  

&gt;None of these things existed before the Mandate. All of these things were created by the Mandate.

Irrelevant, they were created.  Palestine was a state.

&gt;No. That's not what I said

Well it is, but if you want to retract that Palestine was not a state because it was under administration, then fine and all the better.  Palestine was a state under administration just like many others.

&gt;&gt;In article 22 it makes clear of state recognition on condition. The condition being that the states accept mandate.

&gt;No, there is no such language in art. 22. I have read the Covenant, and many of the treaties.

Coming from a man that thought that there was no provision for the  indigenous people in the mandate that means very little.  Here is that such language in article 22, *again*:  

                  ""independent nations can be provisionally recognized
                   subject to the rendering of administrative advice and
                   assistance by a Mandatory until such as they are able
                   to stand alone""

&gt;No, I argued that it was not a state for reasons that have nothing at all to do with LoN covenant.

Oh so now you're arguing it not a state outside international law.  You've given up on the legal argument and resorted to it not being a state if you don't want it to be.

&gt;In reality, the Mandate says that nothing shall be done by the mandatory Power to impinge upon civil and religious rights of existing occupants"".

&gt;The part that you chose to remove means two things: a) that the obligation was on Britain, not on the Jews b) that neither civil nor religious rights of the Palestinians include ethnic exclusivity

Oh Britain was very much obligated as administrator to make sure it didn't happen, by anybody.  But you have just admitted that Israel was not then set up by Britain or sanctioned to be set up.  You've just abandoned that whole aspect of your argument and conceded to mandatory was not to set up an Israel.

Thank-you.  Thank-you.  Thank-you.

&gt;My point was that there weren't any BEFORE the Mandate, which is an indication that Palestine was not a state

And so, by your own logic, that they were there after a point is indication that it had since become a state! 

&gt;And civil/religious rights did not include limits on Jewish immigration. That is a privilege only sovereign states can assert, by virtue of controlling the borders, something that Palestinians did not do, and Britain had no right to do because that'd contravene the primary purpose of the Mandate.

You've just completely made all that up, total fabrication plucked from the air because you want it to be so....*and you've still not read the mandate!

            Article 6:  The Administration of Palestine, while ensuring
            that the rights and position of other sections of the
            population are not prejudiced, shall facilitate Jewish
            immigration under suitable conditions

The mandatory could allow as much or as little Jewish immigration as it deemed fit.  When it felt it was prejudicing other sections it could stop it, or when the conditions weren't suitable.

We also have the MacDonald White Paper, section II of which is all about limiting migration!  It was also in the Command Paper.

           ""For each of the next five years a quota of 10,000
            Jewish immigrants will be allowed on the understanding
            that a shortage one year may be added to the quotas
            for subsequent years, within the five year period, if
            economic absorptive capacity permits.""

           ""This immigration cannot be so great in volume as to exceed
            whatever may be the economic capacity of the country at
            the time to absorb new arrivals. It is essential to ensure that
            the immigrants should not be a burden upon the people of
            Palestine as a whole, and that they should not deprive
            any section of the present population of their employment.""

http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/brwh1939.asp

&gt;&gt;Not by some Jewish immigration, but changing a demographic from 85% Arab to 80% Jewish, predominantly European, does change the civil dynamic and culture.

&gt;Which was acceptable.

Not by mandate it wasn't so its another concession that Israel was formed not by Britain or mandate and that it is Palestinian territory.

&gt;And they had no right to do so.

Oh yes they did under Article 6.  They had a legal obligation to control immigration because they had a legal obligation to control economic and civil stability as administrator.

&gt;So tens of thousands of ""illegal"" jewish immigrants did not happen. Internment camps didn't exist. Jews weren't thrown into Cyprus. Bravo.

Oh illegal immigrants did happen but they were illegal.  What was happening in internment camps  elsewhere is hardly relevant in the least other than to highlight Britain did indeed control immigration in Palestine, as they were obligated to do so.

&gt;No. The protections you allude to did not include the right of exclusion.

Nobody ever claimed they did apart from you.  But what it did provide, and its there in the mandate to read, is that if it ever came at a cost which the mandatory considered was compromising the indigenous people then they could limit, restrict or stop it.

&gt;&gt;What I am interested to know is why you (because clearly the LoN didn't consider it so) consider that ""ALL JEWISH PEOPLE have an irrevocable, unconditional right of settlement in Palestine""?

&gt;Because that is the fact of history, fact of international law, and because we have, are and will fight to death to defend this right.

- Well you've just argued yourself that historically indigenous Palestinians were already there and that you were accepting a massive European migration.

-  In international law you've just accepted that Britain under international law couldn't compromise the indigenous population but that foreign Jewish people could when you said, ""that the obligation was on Britain, not on the Jews"".  That the Jewish claim to Palestine, other than those few already living there, came outside the law!

As far as dying to the death for a right, you're putting yourself far high up in representing all Jewish people when we're talking about Israel's claim over Palestine.  Israel is by no means indicative of Jewish people.  In fact it's a constant source of embarrassment for many moderate, liberal-thinking Jewish people in the West.

But I'd still like to know why you think Jewish people have *a right* to Palestine."

&gt;They eventually either go to war with Russia (for serious)  
  
The Japanese went to war with the Soviets, for serious, as you say it, even before 1941. They proceeded to get absolutely destroyed at the battle of Khalkin Gol. The defeat was so brutal, in fact, that it played a significant role in stopping the Imperial Army plan of going north and joining up with Germany via land. Instead of messing with the Russians again, the Japanese moved south and started taking islands and south east Asia.

As for Russia, the story is a bit different. Even though the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was in place, Hitler did not like the Soviet Union. Not only did they occupy a huge tract of land, which he saw as a natural expansion for Germany in his constant search and acquisition of Lebensraum, he noticed that the Soviet Union was rapidly industrializing and advancing technologically. The Nazis saw Soviet technology first hand during the Spanish Civil War, and while inferior to the tech fielded by the Nazis, it showed that the Soviet Union was a far cry from a shitty backwater country. Paired with the grueling pace set forth by Stalin's Five Year Plans, the Soviet Union could have become a major threat to the Nazis, and fast. Also, there was some ideological dislike there too, considering that the Soviets were Slavs, who were seen as inferiors to the Aryans. 

So, the war with the Soviet Union seems inevitable. The question here is, once the war started, how would it have played out? In all likelihood, it would have been pretty much the same at the very outset, with the Soviets suffering significant losses in manpower, materiel and territory. One of the arguments i read as that the soviet industrial capacity was simply not up to par to provide all the necessities for the people and the war effort simultaneously. This is where the US played a significant role. Through its Lend-Lease program, it allowed the Soviets to bolster their production which allowed them to continue on the war. Without the aid of the US, the economic situation in the Soviet Union could have been a lot worse. I have no idea how this would have played out in the long term... If everything played out like it already has, then the Soviets win and the entirety of Europe goes red. If they lose, the Nazis steamroll across Asia and meet up with Japan.

As for the US becoming a refugee center for people fleeing Nazi Germany, i don't see that happening. People tried to run even before the war started and plenty were turned away by the US immigration authorities. I think it'd be logical to assume that the US would continue it isolationist policy even in the realm of immigration, probably with the local politicians claiming that taking refugees would just lead the US into the war."

Can you back this up?  I know that early founders (particularly, Washington and John Adams) were fervent Christians who wanted to build the new nation based on Christian ideas, but I haven't encountered that same attitude about Jefferson. He, being a deist and a student of Enlightenment thought, wanted to create an agrarian paradise suited for the ""common man"".  The problem was that the common man was the WASP, not the native.  I disagree with your assertion that he wanted to create a ""European-style"" agricultural culture.  He modeled his ideals off Greek and Roman styles of city-country dynamics paired with post-Enlightenment anti-Federalism.  He may have agreed for political reasons that Christianity should be heavily involved in the culture of the new nation, but he himself was not Christian, and would have balked at the OP.

TL;DR Jefferson was certainly an agrarian engineer, but was not Christian, and I have found no evidence that he would support a Constitution that applied only to Christians.  In fact, he wrote heavily against the imperial tendencies of Western religions."
