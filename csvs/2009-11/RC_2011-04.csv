Yes.   What is the relative position of women in China, India, or the Middle East?  Indonesia?  African nations?  What are the other dominant religions besides Christianity, and how do women fare in those?   Historically, say in Western history, has the model ever been different to the despised ""1950's middle America""?  What roles did society impose on genders in the times of the pioneers, or the Civil War, if you want to stick to an American slant?  Or what was life like in medieval Europe?  

Come on, the model of human society where men adopt ""traditional"" male behaviours and roles, and women adopt their own, *is the norm*, not the exception.  Too much huffing and puffing going on these days, and not enough acceptance that gender differences and gender roles are *inherent* in humans.  *When has it ever been different?*  This is key.   Observable and clear gender bias and societal acceptance and reinforcement of gender roles is everywhere, now and in the past.  Point to a time and place in history where we know it was consistently different and then we might start accepting that what we perceive as the status quo isn't naturally derived.  But nobody can.  Suck it up and get over it, this is inbuilt, driven by our biology and you've inherited it just as much as the next person.  

What we do about it is another matter.  We've changed a lot about ourselves by virtue of our big brains.  We don't like violence in our society, so work hard to suppress it.  We understand now that giving in to such basic emotions and urges isn't the best way to survive and thrive.  So, what else that we've acquired from our distant past could we be better off without?  We work on gender bias.  We believe that we would have a better society without it.  But we shouldn't be ignorant of where it's come from.  Three cheers for people who study the evolution of human behaviour.  Fascinating stuff.   Surely better understanding will be the key to dealing with it.  Wilful ignorance of the past before our eyes will not.  I agree that it's a sort of immaturity to be caught up in the emotional side of things and deny the obvious science behind it.  "

Certainly not in the middle east and the rest of Asia. The idea is European in origin and did not spread to the rest of the world until after the advent of colonialism, the rest of the world consisted of multi-ethnic empires that began to disintegrate at the turn of the century, and ultimately ended after WWI.

&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_nationalism#Origins

The 1920's saw the nationalists coming to power. A smart fellow would be able to realize that without the Arabs being self-aware of their ""Arab-ness"" there wouldn't have been a Revolution against the Turks led by Sharif Hussein and upheaval that have swept the levant prior to the war and after. 

What Weizmann might've said in 1905 bared no relevance to the Arabs when the British did not even rule the land let alone giving it to European immigrants. The Balfour Declaration carried much significance because at the time it was perceived that Britain was in a position to actually enact such a promise, and they did.

Let's cut to the chase by stating what your real argument is: that palestinians did not ""declare"" themselves so only when Jews immigrated to the land. And this is supposed to somehow justify the settling of a land already settled by another group though ethnic cleansing. Come up with a better excuse, but keep fighting the good fight.

&gt;Now everyone go away and let us be in peace.

Be at peace in your original homelands of Europe, not at another peoples'."

Even more important is the notion that jobs come before profits. For private enterprise to be competitive in the global marketplace, it must be profitable and be able to attract capital, both in the form of debt and equity. Sure, corporations have large sums of cash, but the steep decline in their share prices and inability to attract capital in 2008 and 2009 turned many businesses into the red and ultimately resulting in lay-offs. 

Now, after becoming profitable again, they are sitting on cash to ensure they are able to acquire needed funding (credit is still tight) and replace share prices to normalized levels. In addition, they are still worried about the volatility and uncertainty in the marketplace.

Overall, its unfair to criticize US Corporations at this point until you see how things play out. Over many decades, they continue to outperform those firms of similar economies (i.e. Western Europe) and just because things are working in the EU doesn't mean the same principles are transferable to the US.

Every light industrial building and workshop will have 3 phase at the switchboard at the very least. Without sockets, you would need an electrician every time your machinery broke down. With a socket, you can physically unplug and significantly reduce the risk of accidents.

Their story about a black scientist somehow engineering the white race is a compensation for their own feelings of powerlessness.  It's a theory that only someone who chooses to disregard science could ever believe, as genetics, language and archeology give us a very good picture of how and where the white race developed and spread.

The whites did not spread to Europe northward from Egypt.  The proto-Indo Europeans left African traveling northwest and continued into the area near Afghan/Pakistan/India region, where whites diverged migrated northeast through Afghanistan, Iran, Georgia, Ukraine and into Western Europe.

Early on in the article, the author champions the developing BRIC countries for their ability to close the income gap between wealthy and poor, which is a direct result of these countries opening up trade and embracing capitalism through the positive benefits of globalization...a fact he conveniently fails to mention.  Why?  Because later on in the article, he blames globalization -- in part -- for America's shift towards inequality.  Rather than attempt to address this interesting dynamic and the positive and negative effects on the global economy that might result from any American attempt to retain blue-collar jobs at the expense of progress, he instead laments the decline of private-sector unions (whose demands for high wages and benefits helped incentivize companies to seek low-wage workers overseas, again aiding developing countries such as Brazil and China) and points to Bill Gates as an example of the outlandish wealth that some members of our society have achieved.

And, honestly, why on earth would he pick Bill Gates as an example?  Sure, Bill Gates benefited from lax anti-trust laws, but the author conveniently fails to mention:

  - the fact that Bill Gates has given and pledged billions of dollars of money to charitable entities, and through his own charitable entity has raised tens of billions more...an inconvenient note when considering the author's earlier assertion that extreme wealth effectively kills empathy.

  -  the fact that Bill Gates didn't earn his money through finance, but rather through invention and innovation in a previously non-existent marketplace, giving him a near natural monopoply from the get-go

  - the fact that because Bill Gates's invention and innovation came in a previously non-existent marketplace, it is only reasonable to assume that any legal policy in this area would be difficult to develop, enact and enforce until the burgeoning industry had grown to a certain size.

  -  the fact that Bill Gates' and Microsoft's technological inventions and innovations have fostered the creation of -- if not outright created -- numerous economies, generating enormous value and a new breed of middle-class, white-collar workers in IT.

  -  the incredible efficiencies that products like Windows and Excel allow businesses and personal consumers alike, empowering individuals and small business with tools that might make them otherwise uncompetitive with larger entities.

Moreover, the author blames ""trickle-down behavioralism"" for people in the middle and lower classes for living beyond their means, without even attempting to address:

  - that people embracing debt is a result of changing policies regarding what is and isn't usury

  - that the ability to assume large amounts of debt has allowed middle and lower-classes greater access to loans for education, homes, cars and other quality of life enhancements

  - what effects our federal government's -- you know, the same federal government that is implied to be an inherently positive source of society due its maintenance over infrastructure -- monetary policy has had on the free flow of capital and its effects on society both positive (access to capital for nearly ANYONE) and negative (umm...mortgage meltdown, anyone?)

Do ""the statistics"" really suggest that ""the chances of a poor citizen, or even a middle-class citizen, making it to the top in America are smaller than in many countries of Europe?""  If so, where are THE statistics?  Because the statistics I could find suggest that [every class of Americans are making inflation-adjusted income gains.](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=2908)  Sure, it's problematic that a disparity exists, but when we look at the facts we can start to ask more actionable questions such as, ""How does this disparity compare to historical eras?"" and ""What implications does this disparity have on our society's long-term growth?"" and ""What policy decisions should we enact to address this issue?""

Of course, then we'd have to deal with other questions, like, ""Is it more realistic to assume that a middle-class citizen SHOULD be able to make it to the (undefined) top or is it more realistic to assume that a middle-class citizen should be able to improve his quality of life and his family's opportunities to climb to the upper-middle class during the next generation?"" and ""Do lower and middle-class Americans have the available resources (such as easy access to credit for education and home loans) necessary to improve their standing generation over generation?""

Buying into the shit that this author presents as fact contributes to our society's inability to combat the very important and increasingly urgent issues at hand.  **Be smarter than this, reddit.**  Be socialist, be laissez-faire, be whatever you want...but be informed.  Think critically when presented with information.

The reason media report this in Europe is because we've already been the victims of radiation leaks from faraway (Chernobyl).  Ask [Scottish sheep farmers](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/scottish-sheep-farms-finally-free-of-chernobyl-fallout-2020059.html) (and Welsh too) about that.

Some things to ponder:-

- Chernobyl used 500,000 people to stabilize their single reactor.
- Chernobyl had 10% of the fuel Fukushima has
- Chernobyl's 30km deadzone had less than half the radiation found 40km from Fukushima
- They won't collect dead bodies within a 20km radius from Fukushima

The above are facts, not sensationalism.  You might describe them as disturbing facts, and therefore sensational, but they are still facts. The situation is unfolding and generally over the last 3 weeks, the news has just been getting worse.  Given THAT, we might expect to hear even worse news than the above facts in due course.  Maybe we'll turn a corner though, and things will improve - it's very hard to say.  But I don't see how they will stabilize these reactors without employing hundreds of thousands of workers over months, as they can't entomb these reactors while they're still producing the kind of heat they are producing. In that case, there's little they can do to stop the leaks from spewing out more and more radiation over the coming days, weeks, months."

This prediction is consistent with the observation, reported on the website of the Agency for Environmental Protection (USEPA), traces of radioactive iodine and cesium measured in air March 18 in Sacramento California. The measured values  were 0.165 for mBq/m3-131, 0.03 mBq/m3 for iodine 132 and 0.002 mBq/m3 for cesium 137.

Radioactive pollutants dispersed in the air would then reached the French West Indies from 21 March and Saint Pierre and Miquelon from 23 March. The concentration levels of radionuclides in air, estimated less than 1 mBq/m3, are extremely weak and can not be detected by the tags of continuous measurement of ambient radiation (Téléray) installed at Point-a-Pitre, at Fort-de-France, Cayenne and Saint Pierre and Miquelon. IRSN analyzed plant samples collected on March 23 in Guadeloupe and French Guiana and one sample of rainwater collected in Martinique on March 21 and no trace of radionuclides released by the accident is detected for Fukushima yet.

Europe has been hit from 22 or 23 March. Thus, Scandinavia, iodine 131 was measured in air in Stockholm, Umeå and Kiruna (Sweden) at a concentration of less than 0.30 mBq/m3, and Finland (less than 1 mBq / m3) and Germany (0.33 mBq/m3 for all artificial radionuclides detected), for samples taken between 22 and 23 March. In the Netherlands, iodine-131 has also been detected in air at a concentration of 0.17 mBq/m3. In France, the first traces of iodine 131 (airborne particles) were detected by IRSN on air sampling conducted on March 24, the presence of traces of iodine 131 in the air and in samples rainwater and plants collected since March 25, was confirmed in several parts of French territory.

Read summaries of periodic IRSN on the results of environmental monitoring

These very low concentrations, which could take several days to several weeks (in the absence of major new releases from the plant in Fukushima), are much too weak to be detected by the network Téléray (163 tag in France). They pose no risk to human health and the environment.

As expected, the southern hemisphere is not significantly affected by this large-scale dispersal.

I'd suggest contacting a local lgbt organization for a list of affirmative therapists, even if the lgbt organization is one of those with a silent 't'.  Then take it seriously.  Narrow the list down to 3-4 through phone conversations &amp; e-mail by asking questions like ""Have you ever had a trans patient before?"", ""Can you explain your approach to treating a person who is Gender Dysphoric?"", etc.  The actual answers actually matter much less than how it feels to talk with them.  Make a point of having an introductory meeting with at least 2, preferably 3, therapists.  A therapist you 'click' with is so much more important, since you're going to end up teaching them all they need to know regardless.  
  
Then expect it to go slowly.  You really just want to talk about it until you feel like it's beginning to make sense.

I think any mention of ""socialism"" is mostly limited simply to Tea Party slogans and the like. I think what we're seeing is a truly massive mobilization of one large portion of the lower/middle class (whom the GOP have hoodwinked into thinking it's for their benefit) against the rest of the lower/middle class. For our European friends, I will just highlight a couple of things: The GOP has convinced lower class workers, who stand to gain the most from union successes (even if they themselves are not members of unions), that unions are bad. As a result of this, the labor movement in this country is basically completely dead, and our minimum wage is at about the same level as it was in 1958 when adjusted for real terms (despite the salaries of management and executives having increased exponentially). A full time, 40-hours-a-week, not-one-day-of-vacation minimum wage worker receives an income of $15,080 – that's only 68% of the income that puts you above the poverty line for a family of four, or $7,000 short of the line. The prevailing opinion in large portions of the country is that it is a good thing for education spending to be slashed. Poor people parrot slogans about the importance of allowing large, multinational corporations to operate free of government regulation or oversight, even when they outsource all their jobs overseas, close American factories, pay zero taxes and pay their CEOs tens of millions of dollars per year. Our Gini coefficient (which measures inequality in income distribution) is the highest it's been since 1929 and is now on par with states like Uganda and Cameroon. The richest 400 Americans have more combined wealth than do the 150 million poorest Americans. 

My point is, I don't think this is some passing fad like McCarthyism where everyone gets really scared about a specific threat and then everyone comes back to their senses a few years later. I think there is some seriously, fundamentally fucked up shit going on here. 

I know Marxist-Weberian kind of thinking seems to be out of vogue, but I really do think this is the only reasonable explanation. Do I think there are some big fat rich guys in a dark smoky room plotting out their next diabolical plan to dominate the proletariat? No. But I do think that any sort of system in which one class is made to have a significant advantage over the other will be self-perpetuating. The mechanisms by which this takes place should be quite obvious – things like the military-industrial complex, the revolving door relationship between lobbyists and members of Congress, the dominance of a few large media conglomerates whose version of the news is friendly to corporations, the prominence of rich and corporate-minded individuals in the upper echelons of our political parties.

I'm not some crazy radical who's saying that the rich are out to get us because they're evil villains. I'm just saying that the rich have the power in this country, and they've done everything they can to keep a stronghold on their money and power. The facts I stated above should prove this. "

Sure, there's always been a far right wing in this country, and Republicans have pandered to them for as long as I've been alive, but there was, pre-Reagan, a sense that this was just the fringe of the Republican party, and not the heart of it. 

In the 70s, liberalism was everywhere, and Republicans kowtowed to it the way you see Democrats kowtowing to conservatism today. Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency, for god's sake. He signed the Title IX laws that mandated gender equality in school programs, so women had access to the same opportunities as men.

 Republicans weren't the pants-on-the-head kooks you see today; they were businessmen and veterans and other self-styled traditionalists. They were generally boring but serious people, with a respect for thoughtful debate that was epitomized by William F. Buckley -- for many years, the default caricature of erudition. 

The road from Buckley to Palin started with Ronald Reagan and Rush Limbaugh. Reagan created the mold for a new kind of Republican, a media-savvy politician who understood that people are moved by [feelings and images](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EU-IBF8nwSY), not argument. Reagan was the ""good cop"" who ended the Fairness Doctrine that allowed for the rise of the ""bad cop"", Rush Limbaugh.

I think the demise of the Fairness Doctrine was inevitable, and we shouldn't attempt to roll it back. But there's no doubt that our discourse is less informed, less reasoned, and less equitable because of it. The explosion of mass media in the past few decades has, ironically, allowed people to cocoon themselves in imaginary universes, where reality is not allowed to intrude. It has also created a cacophony of voices, where the only way to get noticed is to be louder and more extreme than anyone else.

Hence the rise of Limbaugh, Beck, Savage, Palin, Bachmann and the like. 

If you weren't around before 1980 or so, you may think America was always like this. It wasn't. It was not a perfect place, but it was a world where you could grow up with a certain amount of pride in your government, in its hearings to root out truth and burn corruption out of high office, and in the way it really did stand head and shoulders above its rival, the Soviets, whose citizens were essentially prisoners in their own country.

&gt; Sure did, same with America, doesn't mean anything else about those systems are right. I think Democracy is right because of evidence that it seems to work (mostly...so far...well....most of the time). **Not because America has provided a lot of scientific discovery**. i'm just pointing out that in this discussion, that's kind of a non sequitor. it's unimportant to the discussion of Islam as true and as useful culturally/socially/economically. I don' think it's the first, and I know that in the developed world as it is now, it's not the second.

Hold the phone here. When did we move from establishing that Islam was compatible with science to... Islam was *right* because of science?

&gt; um..... may want to check that again. most of the Islamic world (and i'm talking the academics here) think evolution is false.

If you can't logically prove an effect is dependent on its cause, how can you prove evolution? The theory of evolution is absolutely dependent on cause and effect. Islamic theology holds that Allah creates every cause and its effect. So when stubborn Muslims say ""there was no evolution"" they fit into one of two camps:

1. Christian-influenced - They're Young Earth Creationists... and they're wrong. And few Muslims actually belong to this.

2. Don't deny evolution but say that Adam and Eve were created independently from the evolutionary process in Heaven.

#2 isn't a rejection of evolution altogether, just a different take on it. Just as how many intelligent design proponents also don't reject evolution.

And honestly, what does it matter if the layman says they believe in this scientific theory or that if they probably couldn't even explain that very theory to you? Much of the United States also refuses to accept evolution and many of those that do accept it because they've been taught to. Most of the drama over evolution in the religious sphere is due to some paranoia that it's an attempt to cut God out of the equation (which is not something any of the actually religious people worry about, you can always insist on God as being the cause for something or other).

&gt; There are still those in the academic world of islam that claim the world is FLAT.

You know, at this point you've neglected to substantiate or back anything you've said, whereas I've done the opposite. You'll have to cite research or stats showing how many religious Muslim scholars believe the world is flat before I (or anyone else reading this) will believe you.

&gt; Even in the Islamic countries with high GDP science lags far far behind, and intellectuals leave in droves. Mostly because there is a strong anti-intellectualism culture (not this 'jock vs geek' culture of america or distrust of intellectuals but actual murder of intellectuals) for anything but theological study.

Until you establish proof for this relationship, it remains conjecture. Malaysia is one of the Islamic countries with higher GDP and science there isn't lagging as it is in even richer countries like Saudi-Arabia.

It remains about economics and politics.

The Muslim world is still changing everyday. There is no longer (or really, when has there ever?) an anti-intellectualism culture. Even the extremists who might actually try to kill or chase out intellectuals do so not because they're intellectuals but because they're Westerners or not (again, politics). Even the Taliban or Al-Qaeda value engineers and chemists, it helps them make better bombs! To assert anyone is truly anti-intellectual is short-sighted. People are just picky over the sort of intellectual tradition they prefer. It's politics, not religion. I'm disappointed you'd resort to 6 o'clock Fox News stereotypes without a shred of evidence.

&gt; again, the economic conditions of the time favored this expansion. The religion provided a codified system sure, and it even worked...but it was a more 'liberal' theology then the one practiced now.

The theology hasn't changed from the 11th century. The Muslim world by and large follows the creeds of Imams Abu Hasan al-Ash'ari and Abu Mansur al-Maturidi (who died in 936 and 944 AD respectively).

I understand what you're getting at with the the idea that Islam was more liberal back then, I wouldn't disagree. The rise of extremely conservative movements is pretty new. It's actually Western-influenced. The conservatives actually reject Islam's tradition of scholarship and academic/legal precedent, because they follow the axiom of Western culture that anyone who can publish a book, should, and anyone who can call himself a scholar, should.

The scholarship system was under tight control until the 20th century when many, under influence from the occupying West, just started up their own schools of ad hoc interpretation. Nevermind the fact that none of their positions holds up under any philosophical/logical assessment with the orthodox tradition. Being ""right' doesn't matter. Being powerful does. This was exacerbated with the West pumping one such group (The Saudis... look up the history of the Wahhabis, they're new) with billions of dollars.

Before the West's tradition of secularism was forced on the Muslim world, to be a religious scholar meant you needed to graduate an institution of higher learning that was accredited with a degree and a licence to either teach or issue legal rulings. There was also a system of academic peer review for all published content (since ijma', or consensus of the scholarly community, is a big deal in Islamic legal theory).

European powers who took over the Muslim world basically taught people ""you don't need to treat religion like that, just make it up as you go along!"" and thus all the radicals, extremists, etc were born. And of course, terrorists. Doesn't matter how many religious proofs, precedent are brought up to refute them and their views, they won't listen to reason because they've been taught by the West that religion is separate from reason and the two must remain completely separate.

&gt; it was neutered politically. working with nonbelievers, having them in your city, discussions with them, all acceptable.

How does this neuter it? Non-Muslims lived with Muslims since the beginning of Islam.

I'll throw you a bone and give you this. It now seems liberal because of the aforementioned emergence of new conservative movements within Islam that had no historical precedent. So all you're glad about is that Muslims are returning to the original religion.

&gt; Keeping half of Islamic countries work force from working doesn't work.

I'm pretty sure that when there aren't nearly enough jobs even for the men, the problem isn't the women lacking jobs. Or, I don't know, perhaps you've got some magical economic model where you can create jobs only for women and leave the men unemployed?

&gt; In the economically bankrupt and socially hindered countries it's no surprise which form of Islam you find. It's not causative, Islam doesn't CAUSE these problems. That form just exacerbates them and breeds in it.
&gt;
&gt;  I realize it's not Islam itself that is the direct issue here but instead certain cultural issues in conjunction with Islam, but that's one of the reasons Islam is particularly problematic here. It meshes into so many things that changing anything causes issues. Being able to say 'look, this improves lives' should be enough for things to change. Instead you have to debate obscure lines of text from obscure philosophies which where barely relevant to the people of the time. (this is the same condition in America with Christianity, sigh)

Interesting opinions! Especially your thought on Islam meshing ""into so many things that changing anything causes issues"". In Islamic philosophy there's the idea of unity and hierarchy of the sciences (read the work of any classical Islamic philosopher like Farabi or Sina).

However, let's not lose track here. As I've said repeatedly, the only thing Islam prevents from changing is morality and certain aspects of a social culture. This goes back into my original post about the lashing law (the second half of it). This doesn't hold back science from anything except certain inviolable mores. This is problematic when Western ""politicians"" (or politically minded individuals in other fields) are trying to attack religions and other cultures using a fallible and fallacious teleological interpretation of scientific findings. They literally look for justification for their ""way of life"", everything from the constantly changing views of sexuality to reality shows.

This is all a red herring. Humans might be philosophically robust creatures but we are psychologically robust. Our biology hasn't changed. This means there is an optimal equilibrium of expression of our biological needs and drives. This means constantly changing morality will only cause psychological/sociological harm to society.

As I've said earlier, our morality (and the law based on it) is derived from biologically derived behavioral norm. This is unchanging. So how would you justify changing morality? Just because it's a scientist advocating it doesn't mean it's right. And going by your own logic, this isn't something science itself naturally lends itself to (being used as a political tool of attack).

The idea that technology sufficiently alters our behavioral norm to the point where it justifies changing long held notions of morality based on unchanging factors is extremely short-sighted. Technology can disappear in an instant from a civilization, plus it isn't accessible to most of the world so this reasoning doesn't apply to most human beings.

What makes one moral system more conducive to science than another? So long as a moral system is needed (which it always will be because all humans have morals, even if they keep changing them rapidly), there's no reason it can't be Islam and I challenge you to disprove that with substantiated argument (for a change). The only alternative you are peddling here is no moral system, just constantly changing social/cultural mores that don't ""hold back"" progress (when in fact our human values/morals/etc or at least a system like Islam, would only guide the development of knowledge in certain ways, not hold it back... sociology of knowledge, a field in which Muslim social scientists were pioneers, btw).

&gt; When the correct economic factors where available, and even THEN it wasn't islam of today, it was a 'liberal' islam, where actually questioning basic tenets of the faith was done by people without fear of political or mob retaliation. 

As I said, what you call ""liberal Islam"", I call ""real Islam"". After all, even by Islamic principle, the older and well-established the ideology, the more legitimate it is, since it's closer to the original Muslims.

As for the ""Islam of today"", it hasn't taken over Islam completely. The original orthodox Islamic literature on everything is still intact and the culture of traditional scholarship (who don't step on the toes of the development of science) is intact, albeit relegated to the background and not something you see on TV everyday.

Newer conservative and intolerant movements *are* slowly losing steam. It's a matter of time before Islam returns to its original form. In case you didn't notice, a good chunk of the Muslim world is sitting on immense wealth and has no idea what to do with it. The economic potential for the Muslim world looks brighter than for the West, as crazy as that sounds. The West's extremely flawed economic system while enabling exponential growth in the last two centuries looks ready to burn out, leaving a decrepit hulk of a civilization. Look at the situation with the culture in America. It's headed in the wrong direction. Muslims, at least, are slowly (but surely) headed in the right direction. The literacy rates and education rates in the Muslim world are non-existent in some places. There's nowhere to go from here but up. Right now the biggest concerns in the Muslim world are politics and economics. If political control of the oil changes, the economic fortunes will change instantly. But it needs to be tolerant political control, not the Western-backed puppet tyranny we've had (and thus all the popular revolutions). The situation is constantly in flux, it's too soon to make predictions I say.

&gt; The Islam practiced in most countries around the world does not work well with 'modern' values. it just doesn't. 

LOL. You mean the fact that Islam *isn't* practiced? Do you know how many people even bother *praying*? Islam as a philosophy, a theology, does not exist for most people. It's just some cultural mores that can be spun any which way to justify any action.

Yes, I agree. This state of things does not work well with modernization (although that in and of itself is a fallacious concept. It's relative. From the perspective of the Middle Ages, ""modern"" in Europe meant backwards and ""primitive"" meant classical Roman/Greek civilization!).

&gt;  In every country where this support is not provided (usually at a political level with strong economic advantages) Islam has gone the way of christianity. 

I've mentioned before several times how Islamic interpretation has been Christianized by the years of Western occupation and influence. Muslims think and act like Christians.

&gt; Islam isn't leading the modern value system because it's directly antithetical to it.

You've done absolutely nothing in all these pages of conversation to come even remotely close to substantiating this point.

&gt; As it liberalizes it can coexist but only through giving up effective power. That's my point.

As it liberalized, wouldn't it be returning the ancient heyday of ""liberal Islam"" as you call it? The age in which Islam was a political, economic, social, and scientific force? How is that giving up power? When Islam had more ""power"", it was ""liberal"". Right now secularism reigns supreme in the Muslim world and Islam's banner is held up by whackjobs. Islam has already given up effective power completely. That's why the state of things is as it is.

&gt;  I'm just pointing out that as economic and social conditions improve, these morals must adapt.

I already outlined my position above on how altering morality directly threatens behavioral norm tied directly to our biology and can cause psychological harm.

&gt; Islams moral codes only make sense under very nasty economic and social conditions. 

That's funny because they were only ever enforced during the time when Islam enjoyed huge economic/social advantages over the West. And now when those advantages have been flipped, coincidentally, Islamic moral codes are extremely difficult to find in the Muslim world, having mostly been supplanted by Western viewpoints. Curious.

&gt; Why is it acceptable for men to have many women in harsh conditions? because women needed to be protected, men did not. women where precious, men where not. women needed to be controlled because without women, survival for the group did not happen. That's horrible, I fully admit it, but it's the reality of survival in such conditions. 

You seem convinced these conditions aren't tied in to our biological nature. They are and thus they will always be present and no matter how much you try to hide our very ""violent"" nature as human beings, it will always remain just around the corner ready to reassert itself.

Mark my words, you'll experience this firsthand in this century no matter where you live. When rampaging mobs get angry that the banks and gas pumps aren't open in the middle of whatever Western country you live in, try reasoning with them ""no these conditions are only in your imagination! the reality is perfectly fine!"". 

No advancement in the last 200 years has altered our biology. Same genes. So society can turn downwards with the same speed as it had previously turned upwards. We are weighed down by biological determinism. Humans will be humans, and without strict moral guidelines, that can become a much nastier thing than whatever standard you currently have of nasty.

Don't you look at the ruins littering the earth of past civilizations? We haven't even figured them out. We know next to little of the engineering behind [puma punka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumapunku) or how that civilization arrived at it. The point isn't to figure it out, it's to know that civilizations exist on a life cycle. The very pace of progress that you hold to be so religiously inviolable can and likely will be reset. Whether it's natural disasters (from below the Earth or from space like a freak asteroid) or of our own doing (war, etc) there's no reason to assume  your civilization will be different and not fit the pattern that every other human civilization has fit. That's like saying ""just because all humans die doesn't mean I'LL die"". See how far that gets you.

&gt; Islam, like all religions, does not adapt in such a way. it attempts to resist all change. that's it's nature.

Reproduction is a biologically determined behavior. It doesn't change. The genes haven't changed. There's no reason to assume anything must be ""loosened"". What, have you loosened your strands of DNA? Just because humans *can* change doesn't mean that they should or that doing so won't mean complete catastrophe, but Islam isn't holding the West back right now. The West is doing that to itself. Just wait and see how things turn out.

Whether you're talking about living or non-living matter... rocks will be rocks, mountains will be mountains, bacteria will be bacteria, lizards will be lizards, monkeys will be monkeys, and humans will be humans. Evolution is entirely too slow a process to come pluck humanity from the clutches of our ancient and primitive genetic makeup. It certainly doesn't operate on the scale of decades or centuries.

Now here's the kicker. Here is something you are neglecting to mention.

It's Western culture that is claiming to represent our animal urges. The entire culture in the West is about NOT repressing our animal urges, especially with regards to sexuality. They even seek to justify it by twisting the results of scientific findings (really, you can find justification for anything if you look hard enough and people don't want to question you) to show ""oh look women are attracted to this"" and ""oh look men are attracted to that"", without mentioning that all of the expression of all of these factors is under social control (thus the entire exercise is lunacy).

If you're into government intervention, then there's the fact the US Government subsidized the most extensive highway system in world history - the Interstate System - instead of high-speed rail and rail-based mass transit, as well as the low US gas tax. One can also argue that the fall of rail was due to the fact the US Rail Administration only temporarily nationalized the railways in the two World Wars, rather than the French, German, and UK model of a publicly owned national rail system. If, following World War II, rail had never been denationalized, we would have a very different pattern of transport in this country.

If you're into market forces, then there's the fact streetcar lines - an efficient form of mass transit the US had the best system in the world of by 1910 - were treated as public utilities and often overregulated and became very economically uncompetitive by 1940-50 or so; intercity rail was doomed by the ICC - a government commission set up to protect shippers and passengers from rail monopolism and abuse of common carrier status - which was necessary in the days of rail being the only game in town, but amounted to a force that crippled rail in the postwar era when it had competition from automobiles and trucking, and later airplanes.

If you're into technological history, automobile mass production was was invented in the US, mass production made the car cheap to own, large amounts of oil in the ground and the highly efficient oil industry in the US made the car cheap to run, low population density, long distances between locations, and subsidized highways made the car a killer app. Air travel - the airplane having been invented and first mass produced in the US - and the large cadre of pilots trained in the Second World War being the key catalysts for large-scale aviation - later killed off intercity rail transport. Amtrak represented the nails in the coffin...except in the near-European density Northeast Corridor. It's sad, as the US has the richest rail history of any nation in the world, even more perhaps than the UK.

dramatic impact on national pharmaceutical industries. In

Pretty much, yes. Another choice quote:

*""Patents for medicines were introduced in Italy, under
pressure from foreign multinationals, in 1978. Today India, China
and Brazil are, reluctantly, caving in to U.S. pressure to do the
same. Proponents of IP argue that this will increase pharmaceutical
innovation in those countries. So we may ask – did the
strengthening of IP protection trigger a golden age of innovation in
the Italian pharmaceutical industry?
During the period 1961-1980 a total of 1282 new active
chemical compounds was discovered around the world. Of these, a
total of 119 came from Italy (9.28%). During the period 1980-1983
a total of 108 compounds were discovered. Of these, 8 came from
Italy (7.5%). While we do not have data covering the most
recent decades, the very clear impression of the informed observer
is that innovations have decreased. Professors Scherer and
Weisburst, in fact, took pains to carefully study the evolution of
the Italian pharmaceutical industry after the adoption of patents.
Here is the summary verdict, in Scherer’s own words:
Research by Sandy Weisburst and mentored by me showed,
for example, that Italy, with a vibrant generic drug
industry, did not achieve any significant increase in the
discovery of innovative drugs during the first decade after
the Italian Supreme Court mandated the issue of
pharmaceutical product patents.""* (pg. 251)"

Hell the mainstream media uses socialism incorrectly even though they were doing a positive report on a European welfare state. I think we need an unbiased sociology class in high school or something so kids can be educated and form their own beliefs but that would never happen for obvious reasons."

The thing is, people don't realize how much this has been part of the equation from the beginning. The assumption that the only way prices can be cheaper from China with the additional cost of shipping has to be exploited labor is a bit simplistic. I say that as a person who had actually paid dues to belong to socialist organizations. I'm not defending corporate globalization, but I want to remind people that it's not always as simple as it seems. 

Despite a wave of reports about the hidden costs of shipping in terms of sulfur emissions confused a lot of people about just how efficient a container ship is. Many of these ships can handle up to ten thousand forty foot containers in a single shipment. That is a vast quantity of goods and the fuel consumption of those vessels when spread across their massive capacity is a tiny fraction of what a truck uses. The fact that they use a dirtier fuel and thus produce a relatively huge quantity of sulfur is often confused with ships being expensive to operate. That's simply not the way it works. Shipping from China adds almost nothing to the cost of manufactured goods when calculated at the retail level. 

Wages are indeed cheaper in China indeed. Take myself for instance. I work in Taiwan as a full-time college teacher. Taiwan, compared to China, is an extremely affluent country but my wages are less than half of what a comparable position pays in the States. Despite earning half of my better paid American compatriots I save a far larger percentage of my income because my living costs are so low compared to living costs in the States. There's hundreds of reasons for why this disparity exists but it definitely does exist and it's not going to disappear in a decade or even in our lifetimes if eighty years remains a normal human lifespan. The currency differences is only one of many reasons for these disparities in income and purchasing power. Even if the US dollar were to depreciate in half to where I would be making equal to my American peers we'd still have far lower living costs here. There are myriad reasons why this is so. 

Those factors are not going to change and it's important to understand them for what they are when making claims about the ""end of cheap"" because prices that seem impossibly low are actually often quite profitable indeed. I just bought a little 2.4"" LCD TV player for the car that cost me seven bucks on eBay. Seven bucks for a cool little LCD TV! It's brand new, but believe me, the guys who sold me that were making a profit at that price.  

Which leads to the automation aspect. This is the part that I am sure most Americans just don't want to imagine is true because it sidesteps the old labor/management debate which takes it beyond the rhetorical framework we're used to arguing where labels like socialist/capitalist don't really address what is driving the changes in the nature of consumption and production --technology. 

In some sense this is a socialist/capitalist model issue but it's one that is clearly being exploited most effectively by the economic models with greater centralized control such as China. When the Chinese set up a new factory, they intentionally plan it in a way that specifically prevents a division of labor into skilled and unskilled craftsmen. All jobs are created equal to prevent skilled labor unions from being created. This sounds simple but the only way to actually pull it off is through extensive automation of more complicated tasks. Even in cases where this is not the cheapest way to set up a factory, it's how they do it in China. See, it's complex. It's not good guys versus bad guys it's basically bad guys who think that repeating the mantra ""let the markets sort it out"" can solve any problem and other bad guys who intentionally control the working environment to ensure wages stay low. 

The part that escapes most people outside of China is the extent to which the element of automation has been part of the equation from the beginning. I think this is an uncomfortable point because it doesn't fit the rhetoric that we're accustomed to in the States where people like to believe that everything technological and scientific originates in the US and the rest of the world has to wait till the US is ready to carry on with technology such as automated manufacturing. 

In fact, automation in Chinese manufacturing has been far behind that in Europe which is the real world powerhouse of highly automated manufacturing until now. Most people assume it is Japan that leads the way in automated manufacturing but while the Japanese are certainly the leaders in producing automated equipment, the biggest market for that equipment has been the EU for several decades. The trend, however, has rapidly been shifting towards China in the last few years and there is no sign whatsoever that this is a trend that will not be continuing and probably escalating on a logarithmic scale in the near term. 

That is why a notion like ""the end of cheap"" is laughable at best. It is quite likely the opposite --the end of the high end. I just bought a Telechips SOC powered 7"" Android pad for US$140 on eBay. This thing does 3D gaming and HD video without a glitch. You've got a hard time convincing me that consumer toys are going to suddenly become inaccessible in the near-term. "

The theaters Canada operates in makes this plane relevant.  Bosnia, Libya etc.  In general, you probably won't see the Canadian forces involved against ultra modern forces, so this does make the stealth not so irrelevant.  Also, the Russians have managed to reduce its effectiveness, not defeat it.   

N.America will Never buy Asian  or Russian.  It's bad politics. There is just the stigma of their planes being inferior (true or not).  We'd pay dearly politically from the American government if we ever bought Russian.
 I believe euro planes won't be considered because of the political clout that domestic aero industry has.  The argument would be laid out that the Europeans are even buying the F-35 because it's superior.
I forgot about the Aussies with the f-35.  

The F-22 is more expensive than the F-35.  That's supposedly why the F-35 was created.  I don't even think the US is selling them to foreign nations are they?   
The F-16 is as good as the F-35?  The F-16 was made in the same spirit as the F-35 decades before.  It was meant to be cost effective and economical.  
The F-15 is 20+ years old.  I know upgrades make them modern and  relevant, but with Canada's military, they need something they'll need for a LONG time.  40-50 years is not a stretch of the imagination.  Buying most  other planes will just leave us status quo to the F-18s we have now.  The only fighter I felt Canada could have used as a serious upgrade contender was the Eurofighter.  This is where politics came in to prevent this though.
So the actual list of available planes is actually quite small.  By not being a military power.  We're forced to buy pretty much what our bigger brother is going to buy.  

My general stance is that Canada needs something sooner rather than later. It has to last a long time too. This was apparent when Canada went into Afghanistan with old, vulnerable Leopard tanks, and were forced to quickly acquire used Leopard 2 tanks.  Don't forget the Sea King fiasco as well.  This is a necessary evil that needs to be paid for.  

Thank you for the intelligent reply.  I've been reading from some Canadians that they actually feel the Avro Arrow is a viable option.

So there really is no way to live in America currently, and get away from  ""bloody oil"". It is interconnected with everything, especially food. Also, European prices are the way they are due to taxes and importing all of their oil. More power to them, and I hope the high price forces America to reform its city infrastructure (one of the things I look for in voting), but the US economy couldn't run like that in the short term (in my humble opinion).

You also have to remember, US military forces have been in the Middle East since the 60's, making sure oil flows. This is not a new problem, and Europe had their hands dipped in the process as much as the US, even if they don't allocate the forces to doing the dirty work (for what's its worth, they could handle an oil price increase a lot better than American infrastructure).

My overall point is, however, if you live in the West, you depend on oil for *every* aspect of your life, and therefore you depend on the people that are ensuring its flow at a cheap price (like keeping a large Naval contingent in the gulf). If this grates at your ethics so, I'd suggest becoming a woodsman.

edit: BTW, last time I checked, Europe gets most of their oil from OPEC (unless Russia changed this). If we weren't there, they damn sure would be."

My buddy Mike (name changed) always wanted to become a cop.  One day he gets a domestic dispute call, someone screaming or fighting on their lawn.  He rolls up, and the screaming was a woman whose house was on fire with her kids trapped inside.  He called in for fire support as he ran up to the woman hysterically screaming.  He ran in to the burning house with zero fire protection and no air, to try to save her two kids.  He tried to kick in their locked door as he heard them burn to death inside.  The firefighters pulled him out.  He had nightmares for years.

If the drug doesn't give enough bang for the buck, it doesn't get approved.

Admittedly, it's nice for people with common diseases, but having a test like that makes it virtually impossible for orphan drugs (drugs that treat rare diseases) to become approved without a separate committee. In the EU, an orphan drug must be accepted by the European Medical Agency. Once it is, each individual member of the EU decides whether they'll approve the drug in their country or not. Since EU members need to reimburse patients for orphan drugs, they don't get approval everywhere.

Whereas in the US, we have the Orphan Drug Act which encourages the production of orphan drugs by giving the companies developing them a closed market for 7 years. A lot of people say that this encourages pharmaceutical countries to drastically mark up their orphan drugs, since they have no competition and a small market. I think that's a facile argument, though. If you look into it, companies that grossly overcharge will be punished by the FDA - just look at that KV story.

India has steadfastly refused to align itself with either the US or Russia, and has refused to be part of either the western or eastern blocs.

We need international attention in order to bring those who are responsible for her death to justice, that is if her death was not self-inflicted! And even still we would like the truth to be known as to what could have caused such a lively person with so much to look forward to to actually take her own life. She wanted to start a non-for profit for youth of South Africa and told the world before ""Live"" TV with all of us that she was taking on the challenge which was to help people from Africa to connect to their roots.

Zandile ""Zandi"" wrote this poem which was provided by her friend Tony who I interviewed recently as heard in this video via the link above this writing.

**I AM AN AFRICAN &amp; I WRITE WHAT I LIKE**

Inspired by my deep love and hope for Africa, children of Africa don’t despair

Dedicated to my late Father and Mother Mpikayipheli and Ntombifikile Mthembu,

Thank you for making it your responsibility to instill my African Identity

From your loving daughter Zandile Bongekile Mthembu

I am an African by virtue of my indigenous and ancestry origin!

And please do not interrogate me when I claim this

Do not intimidate me by reference of your foreign laws and question my citizenship

I maybe in possession of your French passport BUT that does not mean anything….

Being African is my true IDENTITY

Please do not reduce me to my ethnicity

Don’t you dare corner me with your religious ideologies

Now that I know my sisters and brothers across the wide seas across the dense forests and vast deserts of my Continent

I claim my IDENTITY from them as nothing separates us, after all, our suffering has brought us together once more…

In Europe you see yourselves beyond the humanity identity;

Is this why you insist on class and race and define yourselves in your Frenchness, Swissness and Englishness ?

I guess that is your preferred identify…….BUT definitely not mine

Mine is inseparable and is by virtue of my African roots !

Africans, look at our uniqueness, that which does not make us any less common

Our Beautiful flawless silky skin…..

Our Perfect wide and genuine smiles….

Our Strong and Diverse cultures….

Our Women who ululate across the continent as an expression of joy….

Our Drums that which is our core connection…..

Our Bodies that dance to complex rhythms only pure hearts and free hearts are capable of…..

Our ability to Sing and harmonise with every occasion….

Our History that is so rich and deep hence our common enemy has spent years and our gold to destroy

Only that which is significant can intimidate our enemy…

After decades of destruction they still can’t figure out our Pyramids

Perplexed by our ancient Rock paintings

So don’t believe them when they undermine your history’s worth

The Mali Songai Empires, The Shaka Zulu Empires, The King Solomon &amp; 

The Queen Sheeba &amp; Modjaji Empires are just a few to mention….

If so, why does the enemy fight so hard to claim Africa’s heritage as theirs?

If so why does your perpetrator pronounce a “poor” continent her home?

Rise my African brothers and sisters rise from all over your foreign descendants

Claim that which is a Great symbol of our history

From the slavery of Zanzibar and Ghana to the Mississippi plantations

From the tip of South Africa to Robben Island

Break the chains of inferiority and rise to the significant victory against the Colonial rule….

From the Ethiopians defeat of Italian troops in 1856 to Shaka Zulu victory of the English guns destroyed with the iron spears….

Such incidents are no means just a coincidence BUT remind us of the mighty warriors we are…and time is still too early to pronounce this as insignificant

Teach your children about your Heroines and Heroes from the pride of our ancient era to the distasteful testing times

Instill your sense of PRIDE to our Future generation, if we don’t, who else will….?

Embrace your past and presence and let our Children be the Future to continue to fight this struggle….

Don’t let yourself be deceived that the fight is over…

All we have managed is travel so far to confront our issues….

The time is now to pick up your IDENTITY so that we may see our DESTINY


Beat the Djembe to call upon our re-awakening…

And I will beat the “Talking drum” to fetch our ancestors from the deep oceans

Harmonise in your song with the magnificent sounds of Kora

And I will tell the story of our beautiful music with the Imbira

Look at our strong and bold Beautiful African women swaying their hips to the melody of our rich music… …

Embracing their spectacular indigenous and ethnic Garments….Oh ! such beauty is indescribable…

Let us indulge our taste buds in the tantalizing recipes passed from ancient generation to another….

Quench my thirst with the irresistible and exotic drinks from our source….the Coconut and the Amarula with some Honey “Tej” and hey don’t forget a cup of coffee by the way we are the source too…don’t let them fool you with the fancy branding of cappuccinos and café lattes….

Sing Africa and seduce us with your Voice !

Sing Salif Keita along with Oumou Sangare and awaken the spirit of Ali Farke Toure….

Listen to the sounds of the Griots’ descendants Baaba Maal and Y’ssou dour as they honour us with ancient wisdom….

Blow the saxophone Manu Dibango and blow your horn Hugh Masekela, I can see Fela Anikulapho Kuti and Miles Davis dancing to the tune….

Sing Simphiwe Dana with your deep prophetic voice and join in Angelique Kidjo to remind us of Miriam Makeba and Busi Mhlongo legacy….

Khaled and Cheb Mami release those desert complex vocal cords penetrating our conscience….

I can see you Habib Koite throbbing those strings and suddenly the “left handed” Mfaz’Omnyama joins in….

Dance to the sounds of Imbira Babu Oliver Mtukudzi to give us hope……

Do your thing Father of Ethio-jazz Eskeita Mulatu reminding us that we are the Cradle of Mankind… Therefore need we need to know any better….?

I AM AFRICAN, MY IDENTITY IS AFRICAN, AFRICAN IS MY IDENTITY

Nginguye um’Afrika onguye owayenguye
Ngisenguye lom’ Afrika onguye ngizohlala nginguye…..

I am African who is and was

I still am African who is and will forever be…..African children do not despair! "

We can see that slaves were protected, to the extent that a master could not even slap a slave out of cruelty, given their appropriate status as humans, and their positions elevated to that of anyone else and recognizing that through no inherent defect of their own, but from external factors that lead to their enslavement.

From then Islam moved on to free these men and women through either voluntary emancipation (al-itq) or the personal writing and negotiation of their freedom (mukatabah).

Al-itq required that an owner voluntary free his slave, a practice highly encouraged and replicated by the Prophet the companions and the tenants of Islam. The Prophet freed all the slaves he had and his household has freed more than thirty thousand slaves.

Another example would be Abu Bakr (R.A) who spent exorbitant amounts of money to buy slaves from the polytheistic Quraish and then free them.

Furthermore, there was money set aside from the public fund to free these slaves. For example Yahya ib Sa'eed recalls the exchange ""Umar Ibn Abdel Aziz sent me to collect Zakah from Africa. I did so, then I asked for the poor who should receive it. I did not find any because Umar Ibn Abdel Aziz had made every one rich. I used the money to free some from slavery"".

There is another example of the Prophet setting free slaves who would teach ten Muslims how to read or perform any other beneficial service to society. Another precedent set would be that the Qur'an states that freeing slaves would guarantee mercy for the most serious of sins as well as for any sins that one might commit. This alone contributed more to the movement of freeing one's slaves than anything else.

For example, if a man were to accidentally kill a fellow Muslim, reparations in the form of freeing a slave and paying blood money would be sufficient to attain mercy. In this sense because the services of the murdered man are reinstituted with the freed man and the family who is deprived of a livelihood is compensated. From here you can assume something very important, that the status of slavery is seen as something close to death. That freeing a slave is equivalent to bringing a man back from the dead.

History alone judges the vast numbers of slaves freed from this noble idea.

Secondly is the matter of mukatabah which entailed that a master free his slave, at the request of the slave, by way of an agreement of returning a certain amount of money. In this case the master is obligated to neither refuse this request, nor delay his emancipation. If these terms are broken, the slave is entitled to appeal the issue to a court to address his issue of liberty. The moment the slave presented his plea his master could neither turn down the offer nor should he fear any repercussions because the Islamic government guaranteed that he would work for his master for freedom or if they could not be reconciled to work for anyone else, for payment, until the time that he could win back his freedom.

Please look to the European recognition of indentured servants (with the exception that indentured servants were often worked to death something that Islamic law abhors), a principle applied in Europe hundreds of years after Islam recognized the need, practicality, and humanity in such a law. However the underlying difference being that Islam, again, put funds out to aid these slaves in their workings for freedom. This is pointed out by the verse from the Qur'an that describes zakat as deployed as:

'Alms are only for the poor and the needy, and the officials (appointed) over them, and those whose hearts are made to incline (to truth) and the (ransoming of) captives'
(9:60)

Even when it was of no interest and certainly no material gain of the State did Muslims so vigorously put money aside for these causes in the time of enlightenment! This of course hundreds of years before the cherished Enlightenment that Auto drones on and on about that were motivated solely for Political and Economic reasons, if these are the humanistic causes for which Europeans celebrate then we must reflect the moral distance between the two societies of Europe and the flawless Ummah of our Prophet.

So now that I have cited how the slave’s lot was tremendously increased from the standards of the West, as well as how slavery was undoubtedly led to be abolished if the two rules of emancipation within Islam were adhered, comes the point of from where and why were slaves kept in the first place.

If looking at the causes of slavery you look to the Romans, for example, you will see that slaves were in positions of abject pity used to allow the Roman public to continue their public indulgences and luxuries. In the perspective of the New World they were treated as a mere chattle to harvest resources and crops from the land.

From the standards set by the Prophet and the rightly guided Caliphs, none of these factors of material gain ever presented themselves as motivation for the influx of greater number of slaves. The fact of the matter is that during the time of the Prophet the Ummah was fragile and always in constant danger from belligerent tribes. The Muslims who fell under the hands of these enemies were routinely killed and their women gang raped and then murdered.

For all practical purposes Islam is not a purely pacifistic religion. It is one established on common sense that will allow its people to flourish in this world as well as the next. Therefore it would have been foolish to set free prisoners of war while the enemies routinely captured and enslaved those Muslims who fell under their hands. For the sake of leverage and the fates of those Muslims who were in the hands of the enemy of the Ummah, slavery was a necessary condition imposed by the belligerents. But though this condition was a necessity the fact of the matter is that they were incomparable to the extreme, as was pointed out earlier.
In fact it is recognized that slavery is not meant for as an eternal condition and a byproduct of strategic warfare. The only verse dealing with the captured belligerents which states

‘afterwards, (release them, a must), either by way of grace or by (accepting) ransom. (That is the law,) until war lays down its weapons (and it is over).’
(47:4)

As to those Muslims, who later on, conducted wars and encouraged the traffic of slavery for no reason they are outside the fold of Islam. They had no justification from our laws and were motivated by their own expansionist ideals and want for luxury. Indeed their heretical actions are evident as they took strides to limit the contact of foreign people to Islam and imprisoned converts still, in the name of profit, so as to limit the number of new Muslims of whom they were legally obliged not to enslave.

(I would like to give credit to both Mr Afzalur Rahman and Dr. Qutb for their extensive collection of hadith and verses relating to the subject and for enormously shaping my thinking and providing the structure for my argument)

Krugman, naturally, fails to mention that the spending cuts in Britain [have not actually started yet](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/world/europe/24britain.html). 

&gt; For all the outcry, spending cuts have not yet really begun. They start to kick in next month and will be felt most keenly within communities small and large throughout the country. Local governments will have to cut staff and make difficult choices about what public services to eliminate or pare down.

Do we have austerity here now? [Because we're already worried about it](http://www.bloggingstocks.com/2011/04/01/is-inflation-here-walmart-warns-of-rising-prices/). Hard to blame it on ""austerity"" if it's already right around the corner.

&gt; Why attack Krugman instead of explaining why ""austerity"" didn't work under Hoover?

First of all, I attack Krugman for his absolute laziness in neglecting to consider anything the Joint Economic Committee report had to say. All he does it repeat his same old tired Keynesian arguments. And he claims that the report does not answer questions that it did, in fact, answer.

Flights often make up a little bit of time, so there's a possibility you might land 10-15 minutes early.  You'll be at the bag carousel within 10 minutes of leaving the plane, but Heathrow is VERY slow at getting the bags from the plane to the carousel, so that will be a wait.  Can often be more than 15 minutes waiting for the carousel to even start and then another 10 until you actually get your bag.  

But, worst case scenario and your plane lands 10 minutes late, you're still have bag in hand by 8.30.  Now for me, being an EU citizen, getting through passport control and customs takes about a minute, or 5 minutes tops if there's a queue (I believe you call a queue a 'line up' - well it's actually called a 'queue').  I guess you should allow an extra 10 - 15 minutes being non-EU.  So even then, worst case, you'll be out well before 9.  

Heathrow to Victoria in an hour?  On the tube, you're pushing it, but it's possible.  Heathrow express to Paddington (leaves every 15 minutes, and takes 15 minutes), followed by a 10 minute cab ride at the other end is much quicker (obviously more expensive though).

9.[Full Throttle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PktBJ6HpNJQ) 

Great intro to a great game. I loved the narration,music and the hoverbikes. I also liked the perfect blend of  2D and 3D graphics. The 2D for the characters and the 3D for the bike scenes.

8.[X-COM: Terror from the Deep](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMyPVpogqcM) 

The eerie sense of foreboding perfectly captures the spirit of the game.

7.[Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU-n8UZM5Cc)

The orcish fleet, the music and the voice-over was beyond epic when I first saw it. This game came out in 95' and CGI wasn't nearly as common in movies as it is now. Film directors would have to spend tons of money on props, extras, helicopters and multiple takes to get shots like that. 

8.[Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yWnnk9fyJE)

I love everything about this intro. It has the classic LucasArts humour, snappy dialogue, great graphics and good music.

The green screen scenes might look cheesy today but at the time they felt like a step forward in terms of storytelling. I liked the premise and [when the hell march came on](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R6xCWcf_VU#t=2m12s) I lost my mind.

4.[Sid Meier's Civilization](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZc7pJOEgpg&amp;feature=related) 

What I liked most about this intro was the poetic big-picture view of human civilization it presented. This intro had a big impact on me as a kid.

1.[The Secret of Monkey Island](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejgBZGqKRD4) 

The Secret of Monkey Island was the first PC game I bought on the first PC I bought (I had been saving for that thing forever working as a paperboy). This was when everything revolved around multimedia so it was a big deal for me to get a computer with a CD-ROM and a soundblaster to get the most out of my gaming experience. I remember when I took the computer home I had problems configuring the soundcard, which was very frustrating since I had spent extra money on the soundblaster. After multiple failed attempts I eventually got it right and bam! I was rewarded with one of the most memorable themes in gaming history."

They argued that human behavior is strongly influenced by social and economic models.  They tried to demonstrate that in one set of social/economic circumstances (immediate return forager systems) humans tend to behave in certain ways which are very different from the ways that they behave in post-agricultural and industrial socioeconomic systems.

Your statement that nobody has any hard evidence of how our ancestors were like depends on how far back you mean.  There are recorded descriptions of European observations of forager and horticultural societies that they encountered in their travels.  These may not be your or my ancestors, but they certainly are somebody's.  Is this enough to say ""all early humans definitely behaved like X""?  No.  But that's not what the book is arguing.  It's a softer conclusion (""probably"" not ""definitely"" and aiming a general group of behaviors rather than something definite).

I'll repeat what I said to wed_throwaway that the social sciences aren't like hard sciences.  You can't run experiments on humans like you can on chemicals or plants or whatnot, and you certainly can't do anything with humans that are already dead.  I think that all together, the different pieces of evidence, history, analogy, etc. in the book make a good case for their argument as being a strong possibility of how things could have been, and for the standard ev psych model of reproduction being less strong."

Soviet Union and Nazi Germany had already divided Eastern Europe between them in Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Six days after Germany invaded Poland from the west, Soviet Union invaded Poland from the east and both armies stopped at predetermined border line.  Poland was divided by Germany, the Soviet Union, Lithuania and Slovakia. In  October and November 1940 Soviet union negotiated about joining Axis but it fell down because Hitler and Stalin did not trust each other enough. 

&gt;and tried to exterminate entire populations with gas chambers and such?

Some examples:

- Holodomor 1932-1933, the famine-genocide in Ukraine in Ukraina. 4-10 million dead (25% of population)
- Mongolian Great Purge, 18,000 killed.
- Stalins Great Terror, 1936 - 1939. 10 million killed, roughly 1.2 million of them were shot, others were starved in concentration camps. Stalin eliminated whole social class from Russia. 
- Stalins ethnic clenching during WWII. Executed 21,857 Poles. Put  400,000 Volga Germans, 1,000,00 Chechens, Crimean Tatars, Balkars, Kalmiks, and Turks into concentration camps (up to 40% died during transportation in sealed boxcars from lack of air, lack of  food and water or  from cold.  

At least 17 million people were killed by Stalin.

Well, bog-standard summary from Wikipedia:

&gt;On January 3, 1889, Nietzsche suffered a mental collapse. 

[He writes letters ""known as the *Wahnbriefe* (""Madness Letters"")"" to his friends.] 

&gt;Additionally, he commanded the German emperor to go to Rome to be shot, and summoned the European powers to take military action against Germany.[27]

&gt;On January 6, 1889 Burckhardt showed the letter he had received from Nietzsche to Overbeck. The following day Overbeck received a similarly revealing letter, and decided that Nietzsche's friends had to bring him back to Basel. Overbeck traveled to Turin and brought Nietzsche to a psychiatric clinic in Basel. 

&gt;By that time Nietzsche appeared fully in the grip of a serious mental illness, and his mother Franziska decided to transfer him to a clinic in Jena ...

&gt;Nietzsche's mental illness was originally diagnosed as tertiary syphilis, in accordance with a prevailing medical paradigm of the time. 

&gt;Although most commentators regard his breakdown as unrelated to his philosophy Georges Bataille drops dark hints (""""man incarnate"" must also go mad"")[30] and René Girard's postmortem psychoanalysis posits a worshipful rivalry with Richard Wagner.[31] 

&gt;The diagnosis of syphilis was challenged, and manic-depressive illness with periodic psychosis, followed by vascular dementia was put forward by Cybulska[32] prior Schain's;[33] and Sax's studies;.[34] Orth and Trimble postulate frontotemporal dementia,[35] while other researchers[36] propose a syndrome called CADASIL.

\- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche -

I wasn't there myself. His friends and family apparently thought that he was suffering from ""serious mental illness"", and he made some bizarre statements. 

We use the word ""crazy"" for situations like this. As I said in my OP, I didn't intend for this discussion to be a very solemn and technical one.

no disagreement there. I wish it was more variable and INCLUSIVE but unfortunately not.

&gt; ""Islam's view is a lot more stable. You're conforming them in the wrong direction.""

Yes, stable....and repressive. That's the problem. Islam as practiced in most of the third world is antithetical to personal freedoms. Islam as practiced by most of the modern world is not...but then it's a more (though not by much) liberalized Islam. That's, again, my point.

&gt; ""I completely agree because the current most practiced form of Islam is actually the non-practice of Islam by Muslims.""

No true scotsman fallacy.

&gt; ""The Qur'an and Muhammad's (saw) interpretation of the Qur'an were the evidence.""

Your definition of 'evidence' is so loose that if you where to apply it consistently then you must also accept Joseph Smiths interpretation as true, as well as many modern 'prophets' and 'holy men' which you rightfully consider pure bunk. You do not get to consider something 'evidence' for Islam then not apply the same argument and reasoning anywhere else it applies. Either consistently apply the same logic or admit it's not a valid argument for Islam. This is one of the reasons I dislike religions so much, Christianity and Islam in particular. They indoctrinate there followers to use special pleading 'logic' in order to support them. You would never allow that kind of sloppy thinking for someone arguing there own religion but when it comes to Islam it's perfectly fine to you.

&gt; ""The Orthodox had better historical authenticity and veracity to their claims than the heretical sects.""

No. Both sides have historically been argued. one side was more popular, one side was not. What has been argued historically does not make it true, only what has historically been argued. You're, again, making the appeal to tradition fallacy. Something you would not accept for any other religions claims, why should I accept them from your religion?

&gt; ""It's not hard to actually verify whether Muhammad (saw) said something or not.""

We can confirm what Muhammad wrote by looking at it. There is some problems there (but it's as close as history can get to certainty) it's possible someone changed something....but so unlikely as to be ignorable.

Confirming what he said requires writings of multiple eye witness individuals....and is subject to the above concerns AND the concerns that it's a witness *not* a participant.

Confirming what he said from second hand accounts provides even more issues.

etc etc etc.

Get where I am coming from? You are perfectly aware of this, but the moment you turn your eyes to your own religion all this skeptical investigation goes out the window. why? because it's your religion.


&gt; ""It's still ongoing. Except now Muslims are the new vilified enemy from which Europe and the West, on top of all this incomparably superior technological/scientific/social/political (by your standard) advancement, now apparently need protection.""

Do not mistake the demagoguery of the religious right as the truth. It's true that the Islam of the third world is a threat to civilization, but no more then the ethnocentric and literalistic forms of Christianity. Western civilization is threatened by both, it's just that most in the west are just as deluded about Christianity as you are about Islam.

&gt; ""If your civilization is sending multibillion dollar weapons into space but is worried about some poor Afghans in rags, something's wrong.""

Agreed, and one of those problems is called religion, it's causing issues all around. Christians and nominal Christians here, and Islam there. They didn't cause the factors, but they exacerbate them and are a useful lever to control the masses."

Anyway. The Netherlands aren't all that great. Dutch people tend to forget how racist we are for example. Thought Americans were bad for segregating blacks?

Surely, but that doesnt make it right, and if we're talking about what is right or moral then that is largely irrelevant

&gt;we don't need to needlessly harm animals (esp for beauty products...), but a cure for human cancer is of more relevance to our society.

I would say we agree here. My main point is that currently, a huge portion are needlessly harmed. We can do better.

&gt;It is seen as ethical to sacrifice the lives of a few to same the lives of many. Why? Because it allows the greatest amount of utility for the greatest number.

Yes via utilitarianism. However deontological ethics would disagree.

&gt;all higher species - simply ascribe higher value to our Selves than we do Others.

That we currently do something is not justification for it. I also dont deny that othering may have a strong instinctual basis. However, there are all kinds of instinctual behaviors that psych has identified which are irrational. Things like confirmation bias, cognitive dissonance etc etc. Rationality and objectivity are good, it's what we strive for. Yet man is *rationalizing* and subjective. These are things that man must overcome in order to reach what you could say is a ""higher level of being."" This is what Nietzsche's whole philosophy is about (I'm currently reading Thus Spoke Zarathustra). 

""The overman (Übermensch), a self-mastered individual who has achieved his full power, is an almost omnipresent idea in Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Man as a race is merely a bridge between animals and the overman. Nietzsche also makes a point that the overman is not an end result for a person, but more the journey toward self-mastery.

The will to power is the fundamental component of human nature. Everything we do is an expression of the will to power. The will to power is a psychological analysis of all human action and is accentuated by self-overcoming and self-enhancement. Contrasted with living for procreation, pleasure, or happiness, the will to power is the summary of all man's struggle against his surrounding environment as well as his reason for living in it.""

The last man is a term used to describe the antithesis of the Ubermensch, a weak-willed individual, one who is tired of life, takes no risks, seeks only comfort and security: the last man. Nietzsche saw that nothing great is possible for the Last Man, and it is Nietzsche's contention that Western civilization (Europe) is moving in the direction of the last man, an apathetic creature, who has no great passion or commitment, who is unable to dream, who merely earns his living and keeps warm.

&gt;They have the same moral agency.

I apologize, because I did not understand what was meant by moral agency. No a dog is not able to make the same moral judgments as a man. The way I misunderstood the question though was, does the rescuer have the same moral *obligation* to rescue both the man and the dog? I would say yes, based on their equal capacity to suffer. 

You argue no, because they are different species. But what does that MEAN, different in what specific respects? What characteristics makes one worth saving and not the other? The dog has different physical characteristics, legs, fur etc. But how is that conceptually different from deciding based on racial factors, ie skin color? Despite physical differences, the man and the dog have the same capacity for suffering, and on that basis, I argue, deserve equal consideration in saving. What if it were a dog and a tree in a ditch? Surely you would pick the dog, which means there is *something* about the dog worth saving. 

If you say no, man has morality/rationality but the dog does not, what if it were a dog and a baby in a ditch, or a mentally disabled person? What is the basis for choosing one over the other then? To justify by saying one is a man and one is a dog is no different than saying one is a man and one a woman, one is black one is white, one an apple the other an orange. Those are just labels. 

I think the Jeremy Bentham quote is worth repeating.

""The day has been, I grieve to say in many places it is not yet past, in which the greater part of the species, under the denomination of slaves, have been treated by the law exactly upon the same footing, as, in England for example, the inferior races of animals are still. The day may come when the rest of the animal creation may acquire those rights which never could have been withholden from them but by the hand of tyranny. The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor. 

It may one day come to be recognized that the number of the legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the os sacrum are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog, is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day or a week or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? the question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?""

The first written record comes from ancient Greece. At the annual Festival of Dionysia in Athens, playwrights competed to determine whose tragedy was the best. When the democratic reformer Cleisthenes came to power in the sixth century B.C., audience participation came to be regarded as a civic duty. The audience applauded to show its approval and shouted and whistled to show displeasure.

In ancient Rome, jeering was common at the gladiatorial games, where audience participation often determined whether a competitor lived or died. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the Latin verb explodere means ""to drive out by clapping, hiss (a player) off the stage.""

While people have expressed displeasure publicly since ancient times, the English word boo was first used in the early 19th century to describe the lowing sound that cattle make. Later in the 1800s, the word came to be used to describe the disapproving cry of crowds. Hoot, another onomatopoeic English word, was used as early as 1225 to describe the same phenomenon. (Ancient Greek and Latin both contain words resembling boo that mean ""to cry or shout aloud,"" though there is no known etymological connection to the modern English word.)

Whistling has long signified disapproval in Europe, as well as in South America. "

The hundreds or even a few thousand dollars charged by the eBay sellers, some of which apparently do a brisk business, judging by their ratings (some of them have quite high positive ratings) pale in comparison to the sums obtained by some forgers. E.g., see [Biblical artifacts](http://www.athenapub.com/biblical-artifacts.htm):

&gt;An ivory pomegranate (fig.1), once thought to be the top of a temple priest's scepter. Until recently on display in the Israel Museum, the pomegranate was believed to be the only known relic from Solomon's temple. This small artifact had an inscription partly encircling its neck which read ""Sacred donation for the priests of (in) the House of [Yahw]h,"" identifying it with the Temple. Pomegranates were ancient symbols of fertility, and a motif known to be used in the Temple of Solomon (1 Kings 7:21). All of this is now moot, since the pomegranate has been withdrawn from view, and the Museum has announced that it is a fake. At the time of its purchase from an anonymous source in the 1980s, the Museum deposited $550,000 in a secret Swiss bank account. This subterfuge alone should have raised suspicions.

That article mentions another artifact reportedly offered to a private collector for a million dollars.

Of course, the trade in such artifacts has been occurring for centuries. In the 1800's there was [Moses Shapira](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Shapira), a Jerusalem antiquities dealer and purveyor of fake Biblical artifacts. 

Of course one can go back many centuries before then as well to find a thriving trade in such artifacts.

&gt;Four cross particles – of ten particles with documentary proofs by Byzantine emperors – from European churches, i.e. Santa Croce in Rome, Notre Dame, Paris, Pisa Cathedral and Florence Cathedral, were microscopically examined. ""The pieces came all together from olive."" It is possible that many alleged pieces of the True Cross are forgeries, created by travelling merchants in the Middle Ages, during which period a thriving trade in manufactured relics existed.

  Let's all just step back from this bullshit argument of all religions are the same, and just for a second, see this for what it was... it was a racially motivated killing... incited by a religious service.

  I burningly disagree... after reading a lot of history books, and seeing a lot of cultures at each others throats, and notice that maybe, just maybe, a religion that uses the word 'Jihad' and constant warfare talk in causal relationships and doctrine all the time can EASILY be contributing to this.
  Look around the world.
  Just because there are a shit ton of peaceful muslims doesn't mean that the religion is peaceful, and it's fundamental ideas aren't absolutely rooted on a domination and constant warfare mentality.

  Most groups, worldwide, don't just up and commit mass murder out of a religious service.  Let's agree to call this one for what it is.

Thus, we see that after the initial moon landing, Congress has been cutting NASA's funding over and over again because it no longer has military value. So really, the government isn't providing space flight anyway, nor do they want to.

GPS was also created specifically as a military project (note the theme here) and was only partially opened up for civilian use - the most accurate GPS bands are encrypted for military use only, and the US government can disable the signal on a per-country basis. In fact, the government's control over GPS is so alarming that Europe had to make their own navigation satellites just so they have political control over them.

Also, if they're making 200k+ in taxable profit a year, that money is most certainly not reinvested or paying off debt.  If it was, it would not be labeled as profit for tax purposes, and as such they would not be taxed on it anyway based on our current tax laws.

That doesn't mean that we shouldn't help their agriculture, but it can't stand on its own anytime soon.  "

Whichever cricket matches that i've seen which were hosted abroad, pretty much all of them had a lower turnout than normal if the host country's team was not playing.

Not only that.  There's reason to believe the term ""Latin America"" was invented by Napoleon III of France during his efforts to turn Mexico into a French colony during the 1860s.  Apparently he and his advisors felt that the Latin origin of the Spanish and French languages would be something in common between the two nations to help win people over.  By this logic, all speakers of Romance languages would count as ""Latin"" (or ""Latino"") in this sense of the word.  This includes people from Italy, part of Switzerland, France, Romania, Spain, Portugal, part of Belgium and probably some other countries.

If you flash your headlights on and off, there is more contrast than between regular beams and highbeams. So flashing them or your fog lights will be more effective than using your highbeams.

Some european model cars have optional parts (all MK IV generation VW's) that you can order that allow you more control over your lights, (Still an OEM part but allows independant control of headlights and fogs, and bypassing the day-times altogether)

IMO high beams should only be used when no other driver on the road will be affected by them as someone could be seriously injured or killed from a resulting accident, not worth it if you're just warning them about a cop.

And even so irrelevant since genetic studies disprove this claim. You find one particular allele that says there is some Khazar influence and announce that Ashkenazi are not Jews. Meanwhile Ashkenazi are more closely related genetically to Palestinians than Palestinians are to Saudis. Which means that Palestinians are, by your terms, more Jewish than Arab.

So, anyway, lets actually read your source:

""A good guess is that at roughly the time the Khazar kingdom disappeared, a very small number of closely related individuals with the tradition of being Levi'im, or perhaps only a single male, came from the general region of the Khazar kingdom to join the then-small Ashkenazi community in Europe. ""

And:

""But in the centuries since the beginnings of European Jewry, the best available estimate is that a mere 0.5% of new material entered the gene pool of Ashkenazi Jews in each generation.""

So, yes, irrelevant.

concealer comes in sticks and creams. I used to dig the sticks, but they can end up being greasy and cakey. lately, I've found that cream concealer blends better and doesn't look heavy. I dot it around my eyes (because of my eastern European heritage) and on any other red bumps, pimples.

then for foundation. foundation is kinda a biotch. I usually go for cream in winter and powder in summer - helps counteract the dry/humid weather. for either, I use a typical make-up sponge. I've found that flat circular ones work much better than the triangular ones. then paint. blend everything, being careful not to stop at your jawline - this can create unbecoming lines.

if you want to do eye shadow, go across the lid and then up towards the tip of your eyebrow. generally, I do a lighter shade on my lid, and sometimes highlight the crease with a darker color. blend it all with your fingers until you've got a look you like. I sometimes use the same lighter color just under my brow and near the waterline of my lower lid - I've found these can help brighten up eyes.

I don't usually go for blush, so I can't really explain that :(

eyeliner. I'll use a liquid on my upper lid sometimes and a pencil on my lower lid, but rarely both. lower lid eyeliner can be intense and will make your eyes look smaller. practice makes perfect for the liquid/upper lid. I usually don't tug the lid while applying, just keep it steady and as close to the waterline as possible. my eyes are slightly different - you may want to play around with balancing them out.

mascara's an easy one. after applying, wait a few minutes and repeat.

I usually use a medium pink gloss on my lips. if I need to darken, I'll use brown eyeliner to line my lips, then blend blend blend. but this would be kinda fancy.

I grew up without a maternal figure too, so I had to figure all this out - so you can too. play around with some cheap makeup until you find your ""look"". then invest in some high end stuff - it's worth it.

don't take it too seriously. it can almost be an art project once you get comfortable with it - pretty fun to play around.

one way I counteract dirty nailbeds is to wear polish (usually black or dark red) with a clear coat to prevent it from chipping the first day.

OH! and my huge girl tip lifesaver: get a pumice stone for your feet. I usually take a minute for them while conditioning. you'd be amazed. also feels great on itches :) and removes any other dry skin (not that you should scrub with it, but about once a month, my skin gets flakey. I can nip it in the bud in the shower with the pumice, targeting problematic areas).

please don't ever tan. it's gross and will kill you. let the Jersey Shore girls get the cancer.

hope this helps :) have fun!"

&gt; The other thing that separates the Indian audience from the European is the level of security.

&gt; David Gower remarked on why Indians flung things at fielders on the boundary. The intent wasn’t to hurt, he said generously, just to distract, “though there were one or two good arms out there”.

&gt; Why do we throw things? It’s difficult for others to follow our manner of forcibly inserting ourselves into the action through such simian behaviour.



Mr Writer quotes an ex-cricketer and a commentator saying that the audience in India throws stuff to distract. After that quote, he completely ignores it, and invents a bullshit reason out of thin air because _others cannot follow our manner_. He, as their faux-white representative among the natives, tries to correct them. Without any conclusion, with the only goal of using the word simian in there somehow. The shit paragraph does not even make sense. He asks a question, and does not answer it. 

---------------------------------------------------------

&gt; The Indian is deeply prejudiced against Africans and black players have always been targeted... A bottle hit Vasbert Drakes at Rajkot in 2002.

[I assume that gentleman is black.]

Mr Writer just quoted a white guy [Gower] as telling us why Indians throw bottles; that dude never mentions that they did this only to blacks. But Mr Writer is gonna give us a single example - ignoring Pakistani and white players who have received the same treatment. 

--------------------------------------------------------------

&gt; The policing here is excessive, but necessary. Geoffrey Boycott was upset after his sandwiches were confiscated by security in Delhi in February. I sympathize with him for being forced to eat the crew’s Mughlai lunch. Sir Geoffrey is working class and sees no appeal in the exotic. I think a bit of racial profiling is fine, and we should be firm only with Indians.

Oh, Mr faux-white Writer wants to be firm only with the ""Indians"". Sure, try it out, jerkwad. 

And Sir? I thought Empire was gone. But not the Empire of the mind of some faux-white people.

**Non fucking Sequitors**

Thats what the article consists of. One moment he is talking of law and order, and without even a sub-heading and clue, he launches into commentators. 

His point about Chennai is neither here, nor there. It is completely irrelevant to points before and after!

&gt; I prefer Mandira Bedi. Lovely body and she puts it on display well.

Mr Writer makes sure that everyone knows he is heterosexual with this pointless remark; attempting to remove any lingering doubts in others' minds.

&gt; Between its spectators and commentators, Indians have ruined cricket for everybody.

Grammar, Mr writer. ""Its"" goes with ""India"", not with ""Indians"". I guess when you shit all over the place so many times in so short a space, its easy to forget to flush once in while. 

&gt; Indian money has been poured into cricket, sloshing in its crevices, spilling out of its guts.

Crevice and guts used in the same metaphor? Are we talking about India or a Chimera? I think Mr Writer is confusing India with some creature-land from his imagination. 

&gt; These places are the refuge for fundamentalists **who like cricket played**, shown and seen in the orthodox fashion.

Such shoddy sentence construction does not fly even on reddit, let alone newspapers. Also I am pretty sure he is flouting some grammar rule here. 

--------------------------------------------------------

&gt; Advertisements between overs, **advertisements between balls**. Intrusive, invasive, relentless, shameless flogging.

The **only**, and wholly unintentional, funny line in the article. 

---------------------------------------------------------

&gt; Sunil Gavaskar says he was amazed to first play at Lord’s 40 years ago because of the way the audience applauded. It was, he said, always three claps. Clap-clap-clap-silence. But that is why cricket is an English sport.

The british uised to flog their own soldiers, fighting soldiers who bear arms in the battlefield, up until  the first world war. These people have been conditioned by their upper and ruling class to behave very very well. Classic conditioning. 

I bet I can improve Mr Writer's writing and reasoning ability a lot if he agrees to be flogged to that pursuance. I volunteer for that onerous task.

Nor is it an issue that can be explained away with the phrase ""Not all Muslims are like that"". This is a social issue, and not just a social issue, but one on a global scale in which social and global issues are each complex in their own right. So we MUST, for the sake of holding onto our intellectual higher minds, see this issue from the complexity it derives itself from.

Now, though it is a common argument to hear in threads like this, we must understand that most religions, if interpreted literally word-for-word, are barbaric. I agree with a lot of the atheist and agnostic community that religion is outdated and its creation is not as benevolent as its followers contend. Despite this, however, I care very little what people choose to believe as long as it is not destructive, for people will seek self-actualization through subjective means. 

But what needs to be pointed out though, is that Christianity's history is a little more economical than that of Islam. Christianity spread to Europe and then to the Americas, both of which managed to grow rapidly. And as much as Christian patrons don't want to admit this, their morals have been influenced by the creation of a civilized society that came out of the economic prosperity in the regions it thrived in. Islam, however, was only able to spread to Africa, where it died in Mali. After being beaten out for Europe (and, thus, the western hemisphere) Islam's fate for thriving in an economically primitive region was sealed.

Thus, because the region was not economically ideal, its inhabitants were never really given the opportunity to evolve morally. Afghanistan has a life expectancy of around 43, and when your 20's are your middle ages, you think a lot less about this life, and more about the one that comes after, thus making you a lot more prone to thinking highly about 1500 year old, morally repulsive, scripture.Islam is no less a ""barbaric"" religion than, say, Christianity; it's just that most Christians reside in economically stable countries, while Islam, historically, never left the region it was created in which was void of anything resembling economic diversification. 

TL:DR
-Don't hate the religion, don't hate the people, hate the circumstances. Yes, that's abstract and hard to do, but people with higher minds will be able to handle that kind of complexity. Simple minds, can't."

Because of the struggles of the people in the European colonies (native Americans, Europeans, and everything in between) a unifying term never took off, and it appears there was never a desire to have one (for logical -and sad- reasons). When the wars of independence begun, the common denominator was that everyone was an American and that the people ought to have their one government. Hidalgo used it calling himself ""the Generalissimo of America"", and so did Bolívar in his ""one America dream"". The term American was already in wide use in the US as a nationality and the new independent States didn't really bring any degree of equality between their different races, so Latin Americans continued to differentiate themselves the traditional way, e.g. indian, mulato, métis, european, et c. Hence the ""birth"" of the Latin American by the rulers in Europe who had an interest in taking part of the newly founded states.

You're obviously a European or Canadian freeloader (yes, you're ""successful,"" what I mean is your ideology). I've heard the word ""mum"" one too many times to think anything else about your place of origin. You are such a trite and bitter person hiding behind this faux-veneer of compassion and egalitarianism. I love how you wish bad upon me, but qualify it with your belief that you still hope I get help because you're just that understanding and compassionate. Get real. Embrace your class warfare mentality: you want the government and dependency classes of *my* country to outweigh, outvote, and outlast the productive class of *my* country. Keep creating ways to disincentive the productive class and they will eventually stop producing and then where will you get all the money you wish to spread around? The government and dependency classes won't generate any wealth. Health care isn't a right, and people striving to take care of themselves and their family creates wealth for themselves and the economy at large, as well as the desire to consume and be secure. But I'm sure your list of positive rights is long and never ending: housing, jobs, food, clothes, primary/secondary/higher education, and on and on. It's so perfect in your world, because ""morally"" everyone should have everything. The practicability of the notion be damned...it's what is ""morally"" right.

And this notion that in a ""true capitalistic"" society my mom wouldn't have coverage through my dad's former employer is hilarious. How little do you know about capitalism? If married men and women are more stable, reliable, and secure workers, then wouldn't a company want to create incentives to bring those people in, and one of them would be access to HC for their spouse and children? Derp. That is all I have to say about that. You wish me ill then you say ""but not really,"" and then you call my mom a freeloader, but then you say ""everyone morally deserves it."" You have no core principles--only that you want what others have. Again, do you not understand the voluntary association rooted in capitalism? Are you that far removed from commonsense or do you simply lack the rote knowledge of what capitalism is? I mean, just by positing a capitalist opinion, you immediately assumed I didn't ""understand."" Are you that far removed from divergent opinions that you can only see it your way?

Please never move here, and if you have already, please commit a felony so you lose your right to vote. The producing class needs as much help as it can to stave off the rebels at the gate. And unlike you, I'm not going to qualify that so I can try to maintain a moral high ground and continue to preach.

In Japan, this is below 400°C. In China, Europe and North America, it is set at 540°C. The time it takes for the steel element that is being tested to reach the temperature set by the national standard determines the duration of the fire-resistance rating.

Given this two facts, think about designing a proper containment for a moment.

A molten salt reactor might have excellent neutron physical properties, but from an engineering stanpoint, it is a nightmare. Poisonous, corrosive, radioctive ""lava"" is supposed to be pumped and chemically reprocessed continiously. While not impossible, that is a considerable step up from pumping hot water through a heat exchanger. The only upside is lower vapor pressure.

I guess that's sort of my point.  If you're getting more MPG using a two stroke engine, you're emitting less CO2 per mile.  That's better, right?  The obvious drawback is that you're also emitting NOX and HC (as you point out, based on the design of the engine).  It's a tradeoff.

Yes.  I think it is not accurate to say that it is.  Philosophy and identity issues that surpass the scope of religion are much much more prevalent as problems.

Currently ethnic backgrounds, class struggles between different ethnic groups, old racism and government's despotism are the major sources of tension in the world today.  Even in India, the only place where religious identity and divisions appear most purely ... the corruption from within Pakistan and the memories of recent warfare and class issues, their divisions are what fuel their tensions.

A theocracy is still a government, not a religious practice .. and that's what many people strive for when we say ""Religion will save us!"", often leaving behind many or all tenets of the actual religion.  The American Right has to discount much or all of Jesus' sayings for its current governmental ambitions.

Most religious issues that caused conflict over the centuries have been smoothed over in the name of economics, migrations and interdependency.  That's really what America was created for, due to religious/government corruption and division in Europe.  

Most of the big fights **really** due to religion were internal strife and change (again unsurprisingly related to governance and claims over money/land).

I don't think those on the outside realize how much people in foxholes and in rallies just want an identity... ANY identity... to define why they are angry or hate the enemy.  Largely, people teaching within the churches and mosques just usually are shot/bombed/stabbed when they walk out into the real world... and often by the kings/leaders who wanted them to change their teachings accordingly.

Those who interpret history to focus on ""religion"" as a single entity are actually becoming cultic in recent times, in their own way, to define who their enemies are, finding their identity in that."

The late middle ages, right before the Renaissance, because the Ottoman Empire was obstructing trade from its own region, saw and increase desire for alternative trade routes through around Africa and to the west, a change from wool to processed cloth (which cut down on imported clothing from other countries, thus cutting costs), in Italy there was the ""commercial revolution"" which created the concepts of partnerships and insurance companies, the implementation of alternative forms of lending and credit to the usury format which had been adapted from Christian canonical law. This, combined with the advancements in science and art, it is no wonder why Europe flourished (as well as America which soon came after which is implied).

Does this mean Christianity went away? No. It simply meant that Christians changed their moral attitudes due to the economic prosperity they underwent during that time period. This was due to advancements in government, advancements in science, and advancements in business. The same cannot be said of the Middle East. This is why it has floundered as a region economically. It is also why the social values present in the region are as abhorrent as they are.    "

You are saying the Koran is a divine miracle because it has these highly subjective properties (pleasing rhythmic system for example), a style and structure not seen before that time, and because you claim that it subjectively can not be reproduced.

No, I'm not. The categories of Arabic aren't subjective.

Rhmyed Prose (Saj)

Normal Speech (Mursal)

16 meters of poetry (16 Bihar)

These are not subjective. Any linguist can make use of them and see how any given text of Arabic fits into those categories. The Qur'an doesn't fit into those categories. The challenge is to see if you can produce something which also does not fit into those categories (the minimum requirements being that it has to be at least several lines and also intelligible).

&gt; i'm pointing out that even if x, y, and z where factually true AND objectively so not subjectively so that would never prove the claims inside the book are true.

This is true. It would only prove that the book was not authored by humans but by something greater (that could either utilize Arabic in ways humans couldn't figure out or could enact miracles). The Arabs of the time thought Muhammad (saw) got it from a demon or lesser deity or something. They too attributed it to supernatural forces.

However, establishing that the book is of non-human origin is significant. I think that's credible grounds by which to put trust in the Messenger who delivered that book (Muhammad (saw)).

&gt; who is defending it? I like parts of it and hate other parts. I like the personal freedoms part (and would like to see more of it).

Unfortunately it's going in the other direction these days.

&gt; it's just funny to me that you keep saying 'oh look it's islam' when it wasn't really islam that was the important factor. It could have been christianity there and it would have done almost as well under the same conditions or a host of other religions. It's this weird rub off association thing you keep doing at every attempt.

This can easily be refuted by looking at the recent history of the West. When the West picked up most of these ideas from the Muslim world which led to the Rennaisance and Enlightenment, and started establishing a new economic system which could sustain rapid and meteoric scientific/technological growth, what happened to the Catholic Church?

The Catholic Church's doctrines were literally forbidding people and holding them back from scientific/technological progress (as well as economic). There was also the fact of their abuse of political power.

First there were the schisms. Protestant Reformation. England, for example, freed itself by making its own Church of England and then went on to take over a good chunk of the planet.

Then came the rise of deism and the rejection of traditional Christian doctrines such as the divinity of Christ and whatnot from Europe's prominent intellectuals which gave rise to modern secular/humanist movements. Most of these people were fine with God, they just didn't like Christianity's take on it.

None of this happened during Islam's heyday. Oh sure there were plenty of huge theological-philosophical fights but both sides in these philosophical fights weren't against science. The philosophy of science was unanimously thought to pose no problems for Islam.

By the way, this trend of thought in Christendom spread to the Muslim world during the colonial period. Many Muslims today sort of behave as the ""Evangelical Protestants"" of Islam, when no such thought existed before their exposure to Europe. It figures... Europe takes beneficial ideas from the Muslim world about Enlightenment and the Muslim world takes backwards ideas from them in turn. /facepalm In our defense, they had little choice when being ruled by all these European cultures.

The problem with the whole ""Protestantism"" movement is that it can become a path to greater liberalism (say, the Church of England which is pretty hands off) or to conservatism, even radicalism/extremism (see: Evangelicals). By opening the door to deviating from the original interpretations, you open the door to both liberalism and conservatism.

European rulers sought to open that door in Islam in order to push liberalism in the political domain, to win the allegiance of the people and destroy any political threat from Islam. That door became pandora's box and all the monsters of 20th century terrorism/extremism came out of it.

That's why I take issue with your deeming of classical Islam as ""liberal"". Ask yourself, by what standard? Compared to Islam today? Surely you'd acknowledge the Islam of the 8th, 9th, 10th centuries was closer to the ""Muhammadan"" ideal (7th century) than what's practiced in the 21st century? That's common sense.

&gt; Islam was not the cause of the economic conditions in the region. Islam was not the cause of the social conditions in the region.

Islam is an economic and social order and anyone who's taken even an undergraduate level course in the study of religion, especially Islam, will know this. There's really no point in furthering this portion of the debate. You're just insisting on opinion while I'm insisting on well established belief/knowledge with substantiation from the Western academic community.

While I don't question the influence of economic and social factors external to Islam on Islam, they didn't completely redirect Islam's own internal philosophy on these matters.

&gt; when the economic conditions changed, the form of Islam being practiced changed also.

As I outlined above, that was more related to political conditions (European colonialism), not economic. 

&gt; There is only one 'form' of evolution. It's the one that is and did happen. The difference is the interpretation and 'extra bits' we tack on or that we get wrong. Objective reality is objective reality no matter if we know it or get it wrong. 

The are two forms in the common understanding, particularly that among those knowledgeable. The evolutionary process we observe (""is"" happening) and the evolutionary process you assumed happened by way of induction (""did"" happen). In case you didn't realize, induction is logically fallacious. We just use it because its useful, but it doesn't establish universal or absolute truths by Western epistemology. So you cannot ever say ""did happen"" and mean that literally and definitively as that would be unprovable.

The evidence we do have for the evolutionary process in earth's history is still not substantial enough to leave the realm of inductive conclusions. The only immediate conclusions that can be drawn from the observable evidence is that the species whose fossils we've found existed in the time and place to where (and when) they were dated/located. I'll be really generous and say we can conclude that evolution happened definitively (though I wouldn't be able to prove it). Muslims, for the most part, do acknowledge all that.

The only part of the evolutionary narrative in the West that Muslims take issue with is regarding the first human. Muslims believe Adam was created in Heaven, then plopped down on Earth in the proper place and time (niche) for humanity. This is not a falsifiable claim. You have no direct evidence of who that was or even if they existed. This narration is taken by Muslims on the Qur'an's authority. An authority established by the previously discussed verifiable miraculous nature indicating its non-human author.

If you want to claim it's the devil or aliens just messing with us, that's your prerogative.

&gt; Fadhel Al-Sa'd a researcher in Iraq of astronomy.
&gt;
&gt; I said this happens in Islamic countries as 'academics' and these people get funding in research in these areas of research.

So you're generalizing from one man to how many? 5 people? 10,000? 1 billion? Even generalizing to one other would be fallacious enough given the circumstances.

&gt; Your average joe of an Islamic country in the third world (or even the developing world) thinks evolution is false, just like the majority of christians in america.

Probably for the same reason. Most of the evolution-rejecters in America are Protestant, specifically Evangelical. Most Muslims have been ruled over by Protestant monarchs (specifically the English who had the most influence... both on America and on the Muslim world) for the last one or two centuries.

&gt; the beliefs themselves **can coexist** in a modern society, **yes**. **compatible, no.**

Definition of compatible:

com·pat·i·ble/kəmˈpatəbəl/

Adjective: (of two things) Able to exist or occur together without conflict.

You're wrong. Compatibility is coexistence.

&gt; The point I was making is that the social structures and actions are westernizing because they work 

Incorrect. They work insofar as much the West established rule over Muslim nations through violent force. That worked, their violence. The social structures were then consequently forced onto the population.

*The West won the world not by the superiority of its ideas or values or religion, but rather by its superiority in applying organized violence. Westerners often forget this fact, non-Westerners never do.*

Now you confuse etymology with semantics. The *origin* of the term anti-Semitic comes from a 19th century racist notion. You adopt that racist notion. 

&gt;Are you seriously claiming there are no Jews who have Khazar blood in their veins.

According to the story *you* referenced the contribution is very small. It is not ""none"", it is that you lie to say that Ashkenazi Jews descend from Khazars rather than from Jews from what was and is Israel.

&gt;Am I """"One million Arabs are not worth a Jewish fingernail.""-level racist yet?

That would be the Arab level, the people who exchange 1,000 or more Arab prisoners for 1 Jew. The *Arabs* set the level that high, not me.

&gt;Clever people don't tell lies that are easily refutable, they twist facts.

Sorry, but you are not clever. You provided a reference that contradicted your claim.

&gt;Yes. I really want you to show me in writing ""The lack of Khazar input"", which we apparently can tell from genes. 

From your source: http://www.jpost.com/Features/Article.aspx?id=91746

""A good guess is that at roughly the time the Khazar kingdom disappeared, a very small number of closely related individuals with the tradition of being Levi'im, or perhaps only a single male, came from the general region of the Khazar kingdom to join the then-small Ashkenazi community in Europe. ""

And, in case you missed this as well:

""But in the centuries since the beginnings of European Jewry, the best available estimate is that a mere 0.5% of new material entered the gene pool of Ashkenazi Jews in each generation.""

And since you did not read the whole story read this:

""These studies not only show that almost all Jewish populations have origins in the Middle East, but that the DNA of Jews from almost every corner of the Diaspora is more similar to that of other Jews than to any other population. When compared with non-Jewish groups, the closest match is with the Muslims of Kurdistan, not with the European peoples alongside whom Ashkenazi Jews lived for centuries or the Arab neighbors of many Sephardi populations. ""

And for an extra bonus note that your own reference refers to *many studies*, not some single study. It is even says why some of them were done, and it was not to say a thing about Khazars.

Here are some snipits from the article:
“The story of Tulipmania is not only about tulips and their price movements, and certainly studying the ""fundamentals of the tulip market"" does not explain the occurrence of this speculative bubble. The price of tulips only served as a manifestation of the end result of a government policy that expanded the quantity of money and thus fostered an environment for speculation and malinvestment. This scenario has been played out over and over throughout history.”

“But what made this episode unique was that the government policy did not expand the supply of money through fractional reserve banking which is the modern tool. Actually, it was quite the opposite. As kings throughout Europe debased their currencies, through clipping, sweating or by decree, the Dutch provided a sound money policy, which called for money to be backed one hundred per cent by specie. This policy, combined with the occasional seizure of bullion and coin from Spanish ships on the high seas, served to attract coin and bullion from throughout the world.
The end result was a large increase in the supply of coin and bullion in 1630s Amsterdam. Free coinage laws then served to create more money from this increased supply of coin and bullion, than what the market demanded. This acute increase in the supply of money served to foster an atmosphere that was ripe for speculation and malinvestment, which manifested itself in the intense trading of tulips.”"

&gt; Instead of telling us how to correct our own monumental policies (which you Afghani's were all so happy to take that American cash, etc. during the Soviet invasion) and now it's still 'our' fault.

Yes, because Afghans unanimously wanted their progressive and rapidly developing society destroyed, their country flooded by American sponsored Religious fundies and then have their society sent straight back to the dark ages. The Western education system and corporate media has as designed completely compromised your critical faculties.

Lets be serious for a moment. Most of the major problems currently in the world can be directly traced to modern European imperialism or American hegemony. Honestly, unless we put an end to western civilization we might not have a habitable planet left. 


&gt; Today? Not so much. Frankly, after seeing almost 40 years of you 'Muslims' behavior, I'm not inclined to treat you better than a street dog

Because Westerners have been behaving like angels for the last 40 years! Oh wait, a street dog has higher ethical standards than you barbaric swines. Your incessant and destructive meddling in others affairs, the systematic undermining of socialist and democratic movements around the globe (especially in the Muslim world), the overthrowing of elected governments, the propping up repressive dictatorships, the nurture and dissemination of Religious fundamentalism, the economic policies designed to fuck over the developing world and maintain a global underclass to make your cheap crap, the fucking military-industrial complex etc. etc. etc. is plainly apparent to everyone. So your attempt to chide Muslim ""behavior"" is laughable. Muslims are *paragons of virtue* compared to you despicable and unscrupulous pigs.

&gt; According to the story you referenced the contribution is very small. It is not ""none"", it is that you lie to say that Ashkenazi Jews descend from Khazars rather than from Jews from what was and is Israel.

Are you talking about 1030 BCE–930 BCE?
 
&gt;Sorry, but you are not clever. You provided a reference that contradicted your claim.

Sorry, but you are not clever. 

&gt; These studies not only show that almost all Jewish populations have origins in the Middle East, but that the DNA of Jews from almost every corner of the Diaspora is more similar to that of other Jews than to any other population. When compared with non-Jewish groups, the closest match is with the Muslims of Kurdistan, not with the European peoples alongside whom Ashkenazi Jews lived for centuries or the Arab neighbors of many Sephardi populations. ""
And for an extra bonus note that your own reference refers to many studies, not some single study. It is even says why some of them were done, and it was not to say a thing about Khazars.

All people have origins in Africa, they spread around the world through Middle East. So all non-African people have ""origins"" in the Middle East. Most of diaspora Jews Are Ashkenazi and the fact that they now share DNA is not surprising. 

""In an ethnic sense, an Ashkenazi Jew is one whose ancestry can be traced to the Jews of **Central and Eastern Europe**. For roughly a **thousand years**, the Ashkenazim were a reproductively isolated population in Europe, despite living in many countries, with little inflow or outflow from migration, conversion, or intermarriage with other groups, including other Jews. Human geneticists have identified genetic variations that have high frequencies among Ashkenazi Jews, but not in the general European population. ^wikipedia 

&gt; ""But in the centuries since the beginnings of European Jewry, the best available estimate is that a mere 0.5% of new material entered the gene pool of Ashkenazi Jews in each generation.""

No argument there, see **thousand years** above.

I'm not making any claims about the poor Sephardi Jews. No doubt they are the real thing and had to flee all over Europe from Spain turned against them. 

By the way, Kurdistan just happens to be right next to where ancient Khazaria was."

I am 38.  I have never been a victim of a violent crime, threatened with violence, etc.  I live in Arizona, one of the most ""gun crazy"" (gun rights opponents would say) states in the country.

The problem with the argument in question is it not only presumes that people are depraved and irresponsible by nature (thereby opening one hell of a Hobbesian pandora's box in terms of the role of government - why stop at gun control?), but it creates a self-fullfilling prophecy.  It is like with kids.  You want to give them slack as they grow older to survive on their own.  The kids I went to college with who had the worst problems with unsafe promiscuity and substance abuse tended to be the ones who were the most sheltered growing up and couldn't handle sudden personal autonomy.

The ""people are hot headed"" argument is something they trot out every time gun laws are liberalized in the United States.  They trotted it out when, here in Arizona, they legalized carry in bars for those with CCWs - ""Blood will run in the streets!""

Blood, predictably, did not run in the streets.  It never does.  Ever.  ""It'll be the wild west!""  No, it won't.  Why?  It never is.  People will trot it out a thousand more times, and it will not happen a thousand more either.

It may well comfort those who believe the whole world is comprised of maniacs just looking for a reason to snap that government can be mommy and daddy and dole out privileges to a select few at its leisure.

My question is, though, does that make us safer?  Or does that make us bitches?  Does it make us people who have given up on the prospect that we can all be independent, responsible men and women who can handle dangerous things with meticulous care, and just admit, ""We're completely out of control and nuts.  Better you take these things away from us!""

Doesn't this attitude just encourage the idea that ""we just can't help ourselves?""

And so we endow those with the same flaws - or more - that all humans have - with the special privilege to carry firearms.  Police, government.  It is almost like people forget both police and government are human beings with the same failings as the ""half-cocked"" citizens they imagine - with one crucial difference:

Individuals are more accountable for their actions.  In the United States, if you shoot someone, there's no police union or police procedure book or badge or rules of engagement to stand between you and the law.  Mostly, prosecutors, who have for the most part long since stopped giving a crap about justice, preferring instead to run up their stats, will in many jurisdictions treat the self-defense shooter like a common criminal.

Presumably most are familiar with the condescending attitude of anti-gun Europeans, in particular.  These are people who had two major world wars in the last century yet still insist with a straight face that ""it can't happen here.""  The same people who will write countless sentences about the lack of accountability of the US government, imperialism, hegemony, human rights abuses, violence, will still propose that it makes perfect sense to grant the same institution a monopoly on firearms in society.

As for Australia, I don't know what it is Australians think of when they think of Australian-ness.  But I have to say, I would have thought that Australians would never stand for anything like its current gun control scheme.

The willingness with which fear (they accuse *us* of being paranoid - that always kills me.  They're the ones running around panicked because their neighbor has a gun safe, but we're the paranoid ones) will dictate one's actions - where one will give up personal autonomy, liberty, the means by which one defends oneself, in pursuit of a safe society, continues to perplex.

See, as an American, there's a lot in terms of the way people in, say, Europe, behave, that I admire, that I wish we had more of here.  I wish we had more of an aesthetic sense when it comes to our stripmall-plagued cities and all of that.  I like the softer tones, the ability to ""queue properly"" in some countries.  The lack of enthusiasm for war.  I admire all of that and wish we could import it.

But one thing I don't admire...and one thing I don't apologize for, is not only what gun rights from the American perspective guarantee us concretely, but what it symbolizes about our sense of who we are as individuals, and the role of government.  That government's cute and all but, no, we don't trust the government to have all the guns.

At the end of the day, should the shit hit the fan, I'd still choose Americans to fight with over anyone else.  

Because I really do think they'd be the least likely to turn tail and run.

""Rule, Brittania, rule the waves...Britons never will be slaves"" goes the song.

Maybe.

I don't believe Britons would ever be slaves.

I *know* Americans wouldn't.

Armed, as we are, to the man, one behind each blade of grass.

EDIT: PS -- the worst poison out there is the idea that the battle has been permanently lost.  In some countries, perhaps.  But it is far too soon to give up the fight, especially in certain countries - countries such as your own, and Canada, in particular.

Canadians!  With which I have some experience.  There may be no people on earth more qualified psychologically to own firearms.  Canadian gun control, given the mild temperament of the average Canadian, Canada's vast wilderness, and generally low-stress society, surely is one of the most absurd notions I've yet encountered. "

Fukushima Dai-ichi status and prognosis

Posted by Euan Mearns on March 31, 2011 - 2:13am
Topic: Miscellaneous
Tags: fukushima, nuclear disaster [list all tags]

The disjointed news flow from Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) continues to provide a confusing picture of the status of the 4 crippled nuclear power stations at Fukushima Dai-ichi on the East coast of Japan. This is leading to a very broad spectrum of opinion on the actual status and future consequences. The spectrum of opinion ranges from those who argue that Fukushima Dai-ichi is on course to become a Chernobyl scale incident or worse, to those who argue this is a storm in a teacup, pointing out that reactors have been hit by a large earthquake, gigantic tsunami and survived with minimal casualties so far. So where does the truth lie?

What do we think we know for sure?

1) The Japanese government have warned of a grave nuclear incident on a number of occasions.

2) The status of the reactors, fuel pools and dispersion of radioactive materials continues to get worse, not better.

3) There are perhaps 7 or 8 reactor loads of fuel in play compared with a single load at Chernobyl and 4 or 5 of those are outside of containment in badly damaged spent fuel pools.

4) This report suggests that daily release of radioactive 131I and 137Cs is running at around 73% and 60% of Chernobyl respectively.

5) The Chernobyl fire burned for 8 to 10 days whilst Fukushima Dai-ichi has been emitting radioactive material for around 15 days with no end in sight.

6) There is a 30 km exclusion zone in place and thousands of residents have become refugees with little prospect of returning home in the near future.

...

This report in New Scientist also suggests that very large amounts of 131I and 137Cs are being dispersed vertically upwards from the site. Recall that radiation above the buildings was too high for helicopters to hover at the time spent fuel pools were exposed. 131I has a half life of 8 days and 137Cs has a half life of about 30 years. As a rule of thumb, after about 5 half lives have past, the abundance of the isotopes have decayed to virtually zero. 131I will continue to be a problem for so long as it is leaking from the site but will decay to zero quite quickly once leakage stops. 137Cs may be a problem for about 150 years.

Traces of 131I from Fukushima Dai-ichi have shown up in Scotland and other sites in Europe.

The one thing in favor of the Tepco workers battling to contain the incident is that radiation levels throughout much of the site remain safe enough to enable periodic spraying of water into the spent fuel ponds. I fear this situation will not last for much longer.
Comparison of Fukushima Dai-ichi and Chernobyl

There are a number of key differences between Chernobyl and Fukushima Dai-ichi making comparisons of the incidents difficult:

1) The Chernobyl accident took place at fission power blowing the roof of the core and reactor building while Fukushima Dai-ichi was successfully shut down.

2) Chernobyl had a graphite core that burned, spreading radioactive material far and wide.

3) Chernobyl lacked a primary containment system.

4) Chernobyl involved a single reactor load of fuel while Fukushima Dai-ichi likely has 7 to 8 reactor loads spread between the cores of units 1, 2 and 3 and the spent fuel ponds of units 1 to 4.

5) Fukushima Dai-ichi unit 3 has MOX fuel loads containing plutonium in reactor and in spent fuel pool.

6) Fuel in pool of reactor 4 is not spent and is a 'hot' load outside of containment.

7) Fukushima Dai-ichi is located in the heart of Japan, the world's third largest economy whilst Chernobyl is located in Ukraine which has lower economic standing in the world.

In my estimation, the larger mass of fuel, much of it outside of containment, the geographic location and possible socio-economic impacts on Japan, longer duration and open-ended nature of this event and extant risk of explosion and fire will ultimately make Fukushima Dai-ichi the more serious incident."

Pardon me, but gas cooled thorium based reactors are part of the same IV-generation-program as molten salt reactors (and other ideas). The basic idea everywhere is to contain a self-breeding-fuel-cycle to enhance fuel-efficiency.

After all the gas cooled thorium cycles are *much more* researched than the molten salt idea. There was even the attempt to run one commercially in Germany (THTR-300).

So don't accuse me of shifting focus when I point at the *thorium-cycle-designs* that already failed and point out the reasons. Else I accuse you of wishful thinking that the next attempt will surely work (oh, I do).

&gt; difficulty to control thorium-setups

PBR showed to be quite difficult to handle -&gt; history of AVR and THTR for heat-buildups/heat-caused-problems. PBR and MSRE showed to be difficult to be cleaned up - you have a highly contaminated first cycle/reaction chamber.

I'm NOT (I can't stress this enough) talking about reactivity. We are not citing moderator-tipped Chernobyl-designs here. The MSRE can prove its passive criticality shutdown as much as its wants, a water moderated uranium model can as easily be poisoned. That worked mighty fine even in Fukushima.

I'm talking about the decay-heat-problem. The kind of problem that can't be scaled away with just some more drain tanks. I'd really like to see the kind of argument that demonstrates that increasing the energy of a system (heat capacity of molten salt is not bad) will make handling not more difficult. I'd also like to see an argument proving that local heat-buildups in big-scale (not tiny 7.4 MW thermal) flow-based-system can't happen again, as the THTR-300 suffered these (discovered later).

&gt; China can't be delaying year after year ...

Your source claims (!) startup of a research program. That something at a big scale is in build at all would be news to the [IAEA](http://www.iaea.org/cgi-bin/db.page.pl/pris.reaucty.htm). China is already delaying its [GCR-thorium-program](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/HTR-10).

&gt; India is only beginning to use Thorium

Yes, India plays with another variety of GenIV - the FBR. They tell they'll use Thorium, but at the moment they use U238 to breed Pu239.

&gt; South Africa

... just received a donation from the US energy ministry, because itself stopped funding its PBMR program.

&gt; Norway ...

... [stopped its governmental energy companies ideas for a thorium-based](http://www.taz.de/1/archiv/print-archiv/printressorts/digi-artikel/?ressort=wu&amp;dig=2009/01/06/a0090&amp;cHash=bcba4c022f/) (german) reactor in 2009. The ministry for protection against radiation concluded, that the decay-heat-problems would be the same.

&gt; the engineers who are familiar with Thorium molten salt reactors are extremely enthusiastic

I expect them to be. We engineers are always so easy to be excited about our children. That makes not every idea correct. Simple economics seems to prove me right ... no MSR building anywhere (in spite of winnings of power companies being ~20 billion euro in Europe).

Yes I accuse these engineers of wishful thinking and frankly am a bit tired of the constant ""It will surely work, only fund us some more""-chant that I have heard the last 20 years. In not even 10 years, Germany raised the coverage of electrical energy by biogas-plants alone by 10%.

You know what: I like nuclear fission. I'm fascinated by it. Since school, when I was convinced of civilian use of nuclear energy. When I even did some seminars on final storage (Gorleben in Germany) together with my father, a geologist. But ultimately I saw again and again that engineers too are humans who commit faults which can be disastrous ... which is why no nuclear plant is insurable on the free market, which is why Asse, a final storage in Germany is extremely polluted (cleaned up by government again), which is why Yellowcake-road in Colorado and Arlit in Nigeria are contaminated for hundreds of years to come.

&gt; engineering does work ...

I'm tired of the promise of clean fission - it is like promising the ultimate bug-free program: too complicated to be honest. Engineering works up to a certain MTBF - and nobody wants to think about the ""Restrisiko"".

Let us put up the minimum of fission reactors to produce medical isotopes, radio-nuclide-batteries and some nice bombs to proliferate."

Which is the legal case that trumps? Well, as drivers we can tell when someone is moving slower relative to us, so that's our only way to judge. The fact that your speedometer is 65 and mine is also 65 and I move faster than you may point to a problem with your speedometer. Also, there is law enforcement if I break the law, the drivers do not enforce the law themselves. So, move with the traffic or move right. There are states where they put additional right lanes for slow traffic to move out of the way on two lane roads (I think ME has them, on mountain roads crossing the White Mountains into NH). If there's a car behind you and the right lane is clear then move right, you are the slower traffic. I actually like the signs that say ""Keep Right Except to Pass"" better. I also ""hate"" (I don't really hate anyone, just that some people annoy me) people that know their lane is ending and force traffic to a halt because they don't switch lanes until they hit dead-end... Oh also, people that because they are in a turning lane don't bother using the turn signal. On shifted lanes intersections the oncoming traffic has no way of telling you're taking a turn. But only about 50% of the drivers I was behind ever used the turn lights, anyway. Now, this being said, I've driven in Eastern Europe (that's also where I got my first driver's license). That's a good place to drive if you feel like being adventurous. US and Western Europe are Heaven by comparison. "

The oil monarchies make sure to operate in its interest, while other Arab and North African autocracies that are now experiencing ""democratic revolutions"" have not been as careful to do so.

The NWO has high hopes for China; it is potentially the cornerstone for the global fascist network that everyone expected the US would be, but it's all contingent on China adopting a private central bank; in that event it would be fine if China devoured the whole world, as long as its purse strings were pulled from Bilderberg. Until it does, however (and it shows no indication of doing so), China is technically an enemy of the NWO, along with the rest of the *axis of evil* (all the members of which have no private central bank), and it remains in the conspiracy's interest to gain control of key oil resources before China can cut deals with little rogue despots which will give it reason to defend them."

Summery and possible spoilers:

The main character Conrad Stargard is a Polish engineer from the year 1986. After getting drunk and falling asleep in a time machine, he is transported back in time to the year 1231. Conrad, familiar with Poland's history, knows that in 10 years the Mongols will arrive and kill most of the population of Europe. After befriending a local monk, and a failed attempt at becoming a scribe, he takes a job as a bodyguard to a merchant. Due to his skill at arms and mercy in saving the infant of bandits he had slain, he impresses the local count, Count Lambert. It is discovered at this point that Conrad's ""amazing warhorse"" and ""superb weapons"" were all planted by his distant cousin who invented the time-machines and wished to help Conrad. However due to causality, Conrad cannot be simply removed from the past, but he can be ""assisted"". After improving Count Lambert's industrial base by building a cloth factory and multipurpose windmill, Conrad is eventually granted land on which he can build his industrial base to defend Poland.



Another book series, **1632 by eric flint** is really good as well.



Brief description:
When a cosmic accident transports a West Virginia community back in time and space to 17th-century Thuringia, the citizens of Grantville find themselves thrust into the midst of the bloody and savage conflict that history books would call the Thirty Years War. Surrounded by warring armies and burdened by the prospect of diminishing resources, Grantville residents, under the leadership of a council that includes a union leader, a doctor, and a teacher, proceed to turn their new world upside down, beginning the American Revolution a century and a half before its time. Flint (Mother of Demons) convincingly re-creates the military and political tenor of the times in this imaginative and unabashedly positive approach to alternative history. A solid choice for fantasy collections. "

Turned out that the mom has some serious mental problems, many stemming from her guilt at having three FAS children, and seeing how her alcohol use during pregnancy has affected every bit of their lives.

The kids often struggled in school, and they would feel miserable from being in special ed, getting picked on, and the eldest, the only boy, getting beat up on the playground.

I made sure to point out the things they were good at, gave them pointers on how to deal with assholes, and introduced them to all the nice kids my kids knew.

The boy is 20 now, and about to leave for Navy bootcamp.  He communicates well, works hard, and has learned how to get along with most people, and to kick the livin' shit out of those who refuse to get along.

And picking up a new language is so hard! Which reminds me of a joke: what do you call someone who speaks only one language? An American.

Face it. Your rich people / businesses have options the common people do not. For the price of an extra $10,000 a year, I could be enticed to learn any extra language, no matter how much I loathed it. For the money these people might save, it's probably well over $10,000 a year. The average household cannot afford a private tutor to learn French, but I'd wager a typical rich household can easily afford the private tutor and a summer vacation home in France to boot.

What more, your claims that they would not move to a colder climate is countered by the fact that so many of your businesses and rich people live in places such as Washington and New York. These are not warm, sunny places, but then you'd argue that they're surrounded by like people, so it doesn't matter.

Coming to grips with their new surroundings? Most of them have family in Europe, and with the money they have, they visit them more often than you visit the dentist!

The only thing keeping you from realizing the situation you're in is that constant American nationalism: ""Whoooo! We're #1! USA! USA! USA!"", can I ask you, you're #1 in what exactly? Gotta teach the kids while they're young, so they grow up believing it.

Mind you, I'm not asking to suck up to the rich, or fight over the scraps they leave you. What I'm saying is this: level with the rest of the world, synchronize tax codes, and you can close those loopholes! As I outlined above, you can't do it all on your own, though that is a typical American attitude.

Most importantly, healthcare would be there when you need it, and you wouldn't have to worry about a procedure completely bankrupting you. Not everyone has insurance, or is able to get it you know. 

Education could be the same, but once again, you have to decide to enter the social contract. (300 million is a little off honestly)

If it is good enough for FDR(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bill_of_Rights), it is sure as shit good enough for me.

A ""lowly"" Honda Accord can easily do 100MPH+ on our highway system without even coming close to the design that it was built to do. 

In fact, the fucking speedlimits were 85+MPH before the 70's when the oil crisis ""forced"" the government to institute the 55mph limit to ""save gas"". There were cars in the 50's/60's running around on our current highway system at those speeds no problems.

But, when the crisis was over they kept the ridiculously low limit because they fucking made so much goddamn money off of enforcement.

Evidence of heaven and that the flying creature existed please?

&gt; ""You can also check Wikipedia if you know the names of the various sects and their major proponents and areas of influence.""

That's kind what I was asking for, a link to some research I can see that shows that the 90% accept the scientific claims of evolution part (you know common decent, yes of man also....as the evidence indicates...etc etc etc)

I know, I know. you get to interpret the evidence any which way you want. lets not worry about reality, your belief tops that right.

&gt; ""You'll have to prove that evolutionary theory on principle (the notion of one species evolving into another or into several different ones over time) contradicts the Qur'an.""

Adam and Eve. Science says this idea is wrong. Well...unless you say it's just a allegory or whatever, then it 'coexists' just fine.

&gt; ""Then what are you arguing about? The Muslim world doesn't have money or even necessarily leisure right now. Much of it is still ruled by Western-backed tyrants, the governments are crippled by the IMF and other agents of Western economic hegemony, and there are wars going on all over the place.""

My argument was that Islam is of little utility, the same as all the other religions. It's moderately useful in shit hole social conditions, but not much more then any other Ideology with a nice power backing....but like most religions, it's only moderately useful in western style democracies (like all the other religions).

&gt; ""Islamic economics is basically capitalism at heart with some strong socialist-welfare institutions (like obligatory charity tax). The original Caliphate's one of the first welfare states.""

Which is very similar to most of the socialist/capitalist hybrids of Europe...with out all that silly beliefs that don't conform to reality. like heaven for example.

&gt; ""This didn't exactly hold back Nazi science. Ever hear of Operation Paperclip? Hitler's idiotic decisions is what did them in.""

So, my argument that Ideological craziness not based on reality are detrimental to scientific research as well as social freedom...is....proven wrong by mentioning Ideological craziness not based on reality that was detrimental to scientific research as well as social freedom....

You're right. I have to agree with you, how could I have ever thought my argument was right. your argument is obviously correct.

&gt; ""Islamic policy is far more tolerant than either of those 20th century ideologies.""

So what is the rules about homosexuality in Islam. Are there like parades? or how about weddings. There are weddings aren't there? with ribbons...ooooh tell me there are ribbons.

Religions are never about freedoms. They are about control and structure. Now controls and structure isn't *bad*....but religion is particularly bad about controls and structures because it has the ultimate come back. God said you are wrong.

If your argument isn't based on evidence, then you don't have to resort to it prove your point, you just have to say 'god'.

&gt; ""Nope. Throwing around random words can't change reality. The contradictions were refuted.""

plenty of people: ""bits of the end seem to say the exact opposite to some of the bits at the start"".

person rationalizing there belief: ""the bits at the end are in a different context"".

plenty of people: ""except this part...see...same context but the other bit seems to contradict""

person rationalizing there belief: ""No, see the end part takes precedent over the start part....that's how it works""

plenty of people: ""but...where is that written in here?""

person rationalizing there belief: ""well it's not written, but that's the way you are supposed to read it. everyone knows that""

i hear these same types of ad hoc rationalizations all the time from Christians. We both know they are ad hoc rationalizations. The bible has contradictions. It says x, then it says not x. it's obvious to both of us, but they rationalize and provide ad hoc arguments left and right to 'make it right'. We both know they are doing it just to still believe, not because that rationalization makes sense.

Why can't you see that for your beliefs?"

Every source from the period (not European in origin) says he engaged her when she was 6 years old. The only dispute is whether he married and consummated when she was 9 years old or 10 years old.  In other words, pedophile.

&gt;Its understandable to have your view that Islam is somehow a terrorist religion. 

I don't think that.  I have been saying non-stop that Islam does not let you leave it, or criticize it. If I lived in a Muslim country, I could not freely express the thoughts I expressed here without fear for my life.

&gt;You have to look at the deeper picture. Right now it is Christian and Jewish countries occupying and bombing Muslim lands via their overwhelming military prowess. So obviously the desperate attacks of the oppressed will happen an be Muslim.

The murder of 12 UN workers after the burning of the Quran has nothing to do with US occupation or attacks.  It has to do with them being religious fanatics and fucking lunatics.  Nor do the many other attacks on non-Muslims in Muslim countries have anything to do with US occupation.  Why should Coptic Christians be murdered in Egypt?  Why have the few Catholics in Iraq been butchered and forced out of the country?  Why is leaving Islam punishable by death in Afghanistan and Pakistan? Why was a politician who spoke up against an anti-blasphemy law murdered? Why was the only non-Muslim MP in Pakistan murdered? None of this has anything to do with so-called US/Jewish oppression. 

&gt;You don't think the hardcore Christians get off bombing the shit out of countries and supporting the Jews in their ironic occupation? The blood on the US military, arguably a tool of the Christian Empire, far outweighs the rather pathetic ""terrorist"" attacks of the oppressed.

There's so much wrong with this comment I don't know where to start.  There is no ""Christian Empire."" And no, I don't think Christians (or anyone sane) ""get off"" on this stuff. If you want to see people getting off, go watch the video of Daniel Pearl being decapitated.

Yes, referring to the influence of the British in suppressing the role of Islam in India, which had a big impact in Afghanistan.

For instance, the Deobandi movement arose after the British slaughtered thousands of Islamic scholars who had taken part in the 1857 Mutiny. So a university was established to train more. That's the origin of the movement. To preserve Islam in India from the designs of the British (who pushed for the marginalization of the scholars until India/Pakistan's Muslim population started interpreting Islam for themselves... but not as the British would have preferred, so they essentially shot themselves in the foot and opened another gateway to 20th century extremism... worse than the scholars the British were trying to repress).

Almost all Pashtun follow Deobandi scholars.

&gt; Now it seems you object that there are non-Muslim rulers anywhere.

No, I don't. I even gave you a map. Afghanistan was one of the few places that wasn't under direct colonial rule (except for incursions by the British).

&gt; Today, yes, but not a century ago. You had claimed ""centuries of indoctrination by non-Muslim rulers"". Have you abandoned that claim?

The Young Turks controlled the Ottoman government since the late 19th century. So you're wrong. By several decades so not by a lot (considering the Ottoman Empire's long history), but wrong nonetheless.

 Turkey was not subject to this. I'm pointing out how the one place which wasn't ruled by European monarchs and their puppet despots turned to liberalism and secularism. And the European rulers (look at the pretty and easy to understand map I linked for you, surely you have enough intelligence to understand maps?) had their tribal monarchs rebelled against or even overthrown by other secular/liberal (but anti-Western) interests (like the Baath Party).

Let's also take Iran (you saw the map, right?). Everyone knows about their turn towards secular democracy and the role the West played in screwing that up.

Even Afghanistan, though influenced by India as I said, but not coming under official prolonged rule by Europeans, was quite liberal earlier in the 20th century (before the USSR started pushing Communism and everything went to hell):

http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/05/27/once_upon_a_time_in_afghanistan

Where Europeans ruled, they left chaos and destruction in their wake. Muslims turned towards secular, democratic values on their own. Even by force at times.

The return of Islam in the late 20th/early 21st century is because the popular sentiment in the Muslim world is that secular democracy and liberalism cannot protect the Muslim world from the West (owing to their experiences during the 20th century). Islam can, they believe.

&gt; I did. You wrote: ""Why didn't the rest of the Muslim world start killing people?""
&gt;
&gt; Apparently I was not supposed to actually want to talk about the ""rest of the Muslim world"".

It would be plainly obvious to anyone with half a brain that I was asking ""Why didn't the rest of the Muslim world start killing people **over the Qur'an burning by Pastor Terry Jones in Florida last week**"". Look at the title of this submission, at the link, at the subject of this discussion. 

You've been unable to spin this incident to back your Islamophobic agenda and hateful opinions here, so your only recourse was to try and turn to different subjects."

Dear June, I was the most surprised, but very happy recipient of your nicely typed letter over 2 months ago! As you know, our mail is restricted &amp; I have just been able to make use of this card. I must admit your standard of education must be much higher than that of ours in N.Z. You will understand too that I will not be able to answer all your letter on this small space. I do hope one day though that I shall be able to answer most of your questions in person as we from N.Z. will without a doubt return via your “Lovely Country” &amp; the U.S.A.

Dear June, Another of your very interesting, welcome letters I received nearly 3 wks. ago now, but really I am so busy these days since coming on this Working Party. I hope you will excuse the delay under the circumstances. There happens to be a country man of yours in this party working with me, as I/C of the Camp Hospital. I an Asst. in charge of the M. J. Room which intails very many interesting injuries caused by the Coal Mine where they are working. Just quietly, I am particularly keen on taking up studying to become a Doctor. Afre`s la Guerre, the Canadian R.C. Chap whom I mentioned hails from Toronto, but I’m afraid the atmosphere at present is not to pleasant between us, as he is inclined to Domineer &amp; dictate which I most profoundly abhor. You see! young lady, I’m from the more Gentler Stock and he is far too rough a type of Chap for me to tolerate &amp; live with day in and day out. I sincerely hope all your men folk are not tarred with this same brush! However, this is not answering your letter. Your letter is dated Aug. 1st 43. Naturally I’m very anxiously looking forward to seeing a snap enclosed in your next letter. By the way, you mention your sister Ruth whom I’m also very curious to hear more about, as you say she is nearer my age than yourself. Is it true that she is still studying to be a Teacher of Languages? By the sound of things you seem to have had a marvelous vacation &amp; to say nothing of a simply “Corker” Home in the city. No I’m afraid I live in the country, but prefer city life 100% better. Yes I have milked cows! literally hundreds of the “Blighters” when I was a youth of 17. Hope your ankle became well after returning from your holiday in the bay! Yes I do know of an Armitage in N.Z. something to do with the parliament I believe. Your question regarding my accent rather shook me young lady!! Because my Father is a Major in the N.Z. Army training recruits for the Service. I do speak with a most decided Eng. Accent as my parents are from Eng. I have one brother born in N.Z. &amp; one sister who died in infancy. Yes! I also get those funny feelings inside of me, especially since being a P.O.W.

Dear June &amp; All, I feel rather guilty for not having written before, so here goes! I was very impressed my dear, with your lovely home clothed in a heavy coat of Snow. You see, in “New Zealand” we are very strong worshipers of the sun, hence we are all beautifully tanned, alongside any “lily White Skinned” Englishman or Northern European. We have a marvelous “Sub-Tropical” Climate, which naturally invites all sorts of “Sea-side sports &amp; entertainments practically for 10 months of the year.

Funnily enough it nearly always rains in New Zealand at Easter time 9 times out of 10. Yes, I did receive your very welcome “Christmas Parcel” my dear, late in Febr. &amp; I wondered whether in the world it had come from at the time, as I have some distant relatives on my Mother’s side, by the name of “Perry” living in Ontario somewhere. I’m still wearing the socks with those fancy “White Tops” but they’re terribly darned &amp; darned. By the way, they’re “Corker” thick warm socks you sent. Yes! I worked in the “Civy Hosp” for about 9 mths, previous to the war, but not as an M.D. just aided in the Wards, with the distribution of linen, meals, laundry etc. &amp; occasionally I helped in the theater at the conclusion of an operation. It takes 5 yrs in N.Z. to become a qualified Dr. As a rule, it is an expensive business to become an M.D. as much as I’d like to myself, but it also requires brains which I unfortunately do not possess enough of, for the necessary foundations of an M.D.’s Career. I love the work that a Dr duties entail too. However, I’m meant for the “Wide Open Spaces” an “Out-Door” occupation. My ambition at present is to own a “Big Horse Ranch” somewhere in the Arg. Or Mexico! I’m glad to hear that some of your folk are very quiet and happy. Recently I met a charming Bloke out of your “Air-Force” most decidedly not in the same street as my previous Canadian Cobber. A totally different type!! You certainly seem very keen “Sportsman” my dear! I’m terrifically shy myself on the quiet, so we’d be a good pair Eh! what! You will understand that I am not able to write such a long letter back to you as you wrote to me! Young Ruth seems to have had a very good education up till now, &amp; several very dispensable occupations at her finger tips.

Our Winters are so terrifically mild at Home &amp;, as a matter of fact I’d never seen any “Snow” except on the “Films” before I came “Overseas” into Greece &amp; Germany. Yes! I love “Skating &amp; Tobogganing” but I’ve never had the fortune to do either of these on real dinkam Ice yet! What a thrill it must be! I’m afraid you misunderstood me in my previous letters!

Those socks you so kindly sent are still holding their own! The “Parcel Issue” situation (Grub) I mean, has become very grim of late. We’re all having to tighten our belts.

I’m working in a “Corker” snug little ‘Block M. I. Room” now, which helps such a lot after living in Barracks of 150 men, for so long. We’re independent &amp; away from “The Madding Crowd”!

The Japanese people, the majority of whom live in the archipelago known as Japan, which lies off the eastern coast of the Asian continent, speak the Japanese language. Japan, the most technologically advanced society in the world today, officially was transformed from a feudalistic country to a nation-state in 1871. It remains a homogeneous society in that less than 1 percent of the population is classified as non-Japanese and immigration to Japan is regulated carefully. A considerable amount of emigration has taken place since the end of the last century, largely to the United States, Canada, and South America, The indigenous religious system is Shinto; Buddhism was brought to Japan from China via Korea in the sixth century. The majority of Japanese people today classify themselves as both Shinto and Buddhist, and just over 1 percent as Christian. A large proportion of the population is, however, effectively secular in orientation. The Japanese identify themselves in terms of what is taken to be a shared biological heritage, birth in Japan, and a common language and culture. Although Japan is a postindustrial society and has, particularly since World War II, been thoroughly exposed to North American and European cultures and values, the sense of a shared past and unique cultural heritage remains central in creating a modern Japanese identity.

Location. Japan consists of four main islands—from north to south, Hokkaidō, Honshū, Shikoku, and Kyūshū—in addition to a number of island chains and a thousand smaller islands. It occupies less than 0.3 percent of the world's land area and is about one twenty-fifth the size of the United States. Japan lies in the temperate zone, at the northeastern end of the monsoon region, and has four distinct seasons. Rainfall is abundant. Japan is subject to numerous earthquakes and, in late summer, to typhoons. Rugged mountain chains, several of them containing active volcanoes, account for more than 72 percent of the total land area, and numerous swift, shallow rivers flow from the mountains to the sea. Relatively little land is available for agriculture, just over 14 percent today; dwellings and roads occupy another 7 percent, leaving most of the countryside covered by dense, cultivated forests.

Demography. The population of Japan is just over 123 million people, with a density of 326 persons per square kilometer in the habitable areas, making it one of the most densely populated countries in the world. About 76 percent of the Japanese people live in cities; well over half of urban dwellers reside in one of four metropolitan areas made up of the sixteen prefectures around Tokyo, Ōsaka, Nagoya, and Kitakyūshū. The Tokyo megalopolis is comprised of about 30 million people and contains the administrative unit known as the Central Tokyo Metropolitan Area—approximately 11 million people, a population on the decline because of a small but steady exodus of families who favor suburban residence.

Life expectancy at birth is 75.91 years for men and 81.77 years for women, the longest in the world for both sexes. In 1935 the average life expectancy was 47 for men and 50 for women, and thus it has increased by about 30 years in just over half a century, an extremely rapid rate of change. The proportion of those aged 65 and over is increasing rapidly. At present the elderly comprise about 15 percent of the population, but this figure is expected to rise to more than 23 percent early in the next century. At the same time the birthrate is falling; it is estimated at present to be 1.37 live births per 1,000 population per year, insufficient to replace the current population.

In 1721 the feudal government instituted regular, nationwide census taking with surveys repeated every six years. It is estimated from these records that Japan's population remained stable at about 30 million from the early eighteenth century until the latter part of the nineteenth century. From 1872 to 1975 it grew threefold, and Japan now ranks seventh in the world in terms of population.


Linguistic Affiliation. Japanese is a polysyllabic, highly inflected language. It is usually assigned to the Altaic Group of languages, which includes Korean, Mongolian, and Turkish languages and is not related to Chinese. The indigenous peoples of Japan were most probably the Ainu, a very small number of whose descendants now live in the northernmost island of Hokkaidō. It is widely accepted that the Ainu and Japanese languages are unrelated and that the Japanese of today are primarily descended from peoples who migrated long ago from the Asian mainland and displaced the Ainu, driving them northward.

It is estimated that Proto-Korean and Proto-Japanese separated from each other about 6,700 years ago, sometime after the first distinctive society, known as the Jōmon, was established in Japan. However, pottery dating back about 12,000 years, the oldest known in the world, indicates that a well-developed social organization (possibly that of the Ainu) was present before the arrival of peoples from the Asian mainland. Although Japanese is predominantly an Altaic language, it has some similarities to Austronesian, a linguistic group associated with Micronesia, Melanesia, and Southeast Asia; it is usually assumed that continuous cultural contact and possibly repeated migrations from these areas to Japan over many centuries account for these similarities."

Because the moment any opinion either way comes about. people have to defend it. people have to hold tight to it. the answer 'we don't know' is very uncomfortable, it's also the right one. But once you have 'magic done it' you get to ignore anything else that comes along.

Actually the proof for the role of God as Creator can be logically deduced but not through traditional ontological or cosmological argument. It has to be an argument for occasionalism, which is the only monotheist theological doctrine that is not only internally logically consistent (eloquently dealing with the problem of causation the West still hasn't gotten past), but can be logically derived from a realist view of the world (as opposed to the pantheist ideologies which can also be internally logically consistent, but aren't realism). That's why the leading philosophers and scientists of the West have turned away from realism for anti-realist philosophies or the Idealism of Kant (and if you're still a realist, you're behind the times and not being very scientific).

The realist naturalism of hacks and ideological demagogues like Dawkins (and many atheists on Reddit who are ignorant of the philosophy of science) is not logically or rationally tenable (outside of Occasionalism) and is outdated in the West.

As I pointed out before, occasionalist theology in the Muslim world goes hand in hand with the epistemological skepticism inherent in the Muslim view of the world (for which I have provided links to papers by Western scholars earlier). In fact, this hitherto unknown doctrine, went on to influence prominent Christians like Malebranche who in turned influenced Occasionalists like Berkeley who in turn strongly influenced the famous European skeptic, David Hume, who more or less motivated Kant to formulate his Idealism upon which modern Western philosophy of science is based.

It seems your biases in your social values (which emphasizes things on the basis of their modernity, meaning ignore history and take whatever is new for the sake of its newness) has colored or fogged your view of history. That's assuming you even have a view of history which is doubtful since your writings here reflect only a perfunctory study of history equivalent to a High School level in the United States.

&gt; &gt; ""If we were arguing over what was on page 205 of Jurassic Park, it's not an appeal to authority to go open a copy of Jurassic Park.""

Another worry that I wouldn't have is that if someone where to claim Dino's didn't actually exist somewhere on the earth at the moment....I wouldn't have to worry about that person trying to demonstrate this being killed.

&gt; Research a claim counter to the claims of Islam, and you meet resistance (same with christianity and every other religion when it's been in power might I add).

At this point there is literally no more suitable response than to quote your rambling and quote my own statement above it so if anyone else reads it, they can see what you're doing.

You seem to have no idea what you're doing so I'll tell you. You're basically saying ""It's okay to practice your religion if I like it"" and worse still, ""It's okay to have your beliefs so long as you admit that they are wrong and I am right"".

It's a pity that you're not attempting to explain yourself.

&gt;  I believe all the names of Gods that people have thought up refer to the same God.

Are you aware that drought stricken societies in the past often believed in cruel gods? Yet you think you're able to know god's will because you say that ""he cares for us"".  If they're right you're wrong; if you're right they're wrong, but they had as much reason to think that as you do. For all gods to be true they would share a personality (cruel or kind) and so they could be nothing at all like how people have known them. This suggests that humans aren't able to detect the will of your universal god.

It's more honest to be humble enough to admit you we don't know because faith and evidence aren't enough to know anything about the supernatural. They're especially not enough to gamble on the correct god while ignoring all others.

&gt; Just because I can't prove my soul goes deeper, doesn't mean it doesn't.

Sure, but it does mean that you have as much of a reason to think you've got a deep soul as you do a shallow soul, or to believe that you're reincarnate of the Loch Ness Monster.

&gt; You can't prove that it doesn't go deeper, but you seem to think that is the truth.

Absolutely not, you're very confused about what I (and other atheists) are claiming and here's the core of it:

The onus is on people making claims to prove them. For example,

""A fire-breathing dragon lives in my garage""

Suppose I seriously make such an assertion to you.  Surely you'd want to check it out, see for yourself.  There have been innumerable stories of dragons over the centuries, but no real evidence. What an opportunity!

""Show me,"" you say.  I lead you to my garage.  You look inside and see a ladder, empty paint cans, an old tricycle -- but no dragon.

""Where's the dragon?"" you ask.

""Oh, she's right here,"" I reply, waving vaguely.  ""I neglected to mention that she's an invisible dragon.""

You propose spreading flour on the floor of the garage to capture the dragon's footprints.

""Good idea,"" I say, ""but this dragon floats in the air.""

Then you'll use an infrared sensor to detect the invisible fire.

""Good idea, but the invisible fire is also heatless.""

You'll spray-paint the dragon and make her visible.

""Good idea, but she's an incorporeal dragon and the paint won't stick.""  And so on.  I counter every physical test you propose with a special explanation of why it won't work.

Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all?  If there's no way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists?  Your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true.  Claims that cannot be tested, assertions immune to disproof are veridically worthless, whatever value they may have in inspiring us or in exciting our sense of wonder.  What I'm asking you to do comes down to believing, in the absence of evidence, on my say-so.  The only thing you've really learned from my insistence that there's a dragon in my garage is that something funny is going on inside my head.  You'd wonder, if no physical tests apply, what convinced me.  The possibility that it was a dream or a hallucination would certainly enter your mind.  But then, why am I taking it so seriously?  Maybe I need help.  At the least, maybe I've seriously underestimated human fallibility.  Imagine that, despite none of the tests being successful, you wish to be scrupulously open-minded.  So you don't outright reject the notion that there's a fire-breathing dragon in my garage.  You merely put it on hold.  Present evidence is strongly against it, but if a new body of data emerge you're prepared to examine it and see if it convinces you.  Surely it's unfair of me to be offended at not being believed; or to criticize you for being stodgy and unimaginative -- merely because you rendered the Scottish verdict of ""not proved.""

Imagine that things had gone otherwise.  The dragon is invisible, all right, but footprints are being made in the flour as you watch.  Your infrared detector reads off-scale.  The spray paint reveals a jagged crest bobbing in the air before you.  No matter how skeptical you might have been about the existence of dragons -- to say nothing about invisible ones -- you must now acknowledge that there's something here, and that in a preliminary way it's consistent with an invisible, fire-breathing dragon.

Now another scenario: Suppose it's not just me.  Suppose that several people of your acquaintance, including people who you're pretty sure don't know each other, all tell you that they have dragons in their garages -- but in every case the evidence is maddeningly elusive.  All of us admit we're disturbed at being gripped by so odd a conviction so ill-supported by the physical evidence.  None of us is a lunatic.  We speculate about what it would mean if invisible dragons were really hiding out in garages all over the world, with us humans just catching on.  I'd rather it not be true, I tell you.  But maybe all those ancient European and Chinese myths about dragons weren't myths at all.

Gratifyingly, some dragon-size footprints in the flour are now reported.  But they're never made when a skeptic is looking.  An alternative explanation presents itself.  On close examination it seems clear that the footprints could have been faked.  Another dragon enthusiast shows up with a burnt finger and attributes it to a rare physical manifestation of the dragon's fiery breath.  But again, other possibilities exist.  We understand that there are other ways to burn fingers besides the breath of invisible dragons.  Such ""evidence"" -- no matter how important the dragon advocates consider it -- is far from compelling.  Once again, the only sensible approach is tentatively to reject the dragon hypothesis, to be open to future physical data, and to wonder what the cause might be that so many apparently sane and sober people share the same strange delusion. 

(quoted liberally from Carl Sagan)

&gt; Aren't you the pot calling the kettle black? You have no facts about the supernatural world or God or energy that is other worldly.

A person who doesn't believe in gods isn't claiming that they don't exist, they're claiming that they're currently unconvinced.

As the saying goes: bald isn't a hair colour. Not collecting stamps isn't a hobby. Atheism isn't about claiming gods don't exist, but instead to say that they're as likely as any other made up idea because there's no evidence for them.

&gt; If I'm wrong, when I die, I will have not lost anything. What about you?

Actually you have lost something. That's known as Pascal's Wager, a long debunked religious claim:

As a circumcised male, it’s hard for me to say what life would have been like for me, had I remained uncircumcised. Being born in the south, during the mid-80’s, it was pretty much the norm for all males to be circumcised. All the males in my immediate family were circumcised, so it should only seem natural for me to be.

It wasn’t until my family and I moved over to Europe to live for the next ten years, did I see or really understand what an uncircumcised penis was. If I can remember correctly, I must have been about 5 or so and used to play doctor with a neighborhood boy, down the street. I remember being really mesmerized about it, partly because I’d never seen one before and wanted to know why “mine” looked different.

Of course, growing up, going thru puberty and sex ed. We were taught all about both male and female anatomy, and only then did I start understand what “everything” was all about. 

My personal opinion about circumcision is this, you’re the parent and you know what’s best for your child at that point in their lives. Do I wish that I wasn’t circumcised, part of me does, but then part of me doesn’t.  Just because I had it done as a baby, doesn’t mean my sex life has suffered in any way, shape, or form. 

When I have kids, and if they turn out to be boys; I don’t know if I’d get them circumcised, but then again part of me wants to get it done. To the gentlemen who posted this question, I understand what you’re going thru and if it’s still really bothering you, why not talk to your wife or family about it. 

As I stated earlier, I believe that the parent knows what’s best for their child, at that point in their lives. I’m I mad at my parents for getting me circumcised as a baby, no. They did what they think was best, and instead focused on raising me to be an honest, hardworking, productive, member of society. 

The circumcision debate is something that will go on long after I’m dead and gone. I hope this post helps whoever is out there asking these same questions."

[Police can pick up, beat up](http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=ENGNAU2009111814105&amp;lang=e), and then threaten to kill individuals and their families if they go public with the torture.

[Jordan was used by the United States to fly suspected terrorists to get tortured](http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=41901). This is also the same country where poor expats from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Phillipines, etc. are treated worse than animals and sometimes goes unpunished by the government.

Poverty is also still a huge problem in Jordan. If you drive around Amman, it almost feels like you're in the streets of a European capital, but once you start going outside the ""touristy areas"", you see dirt poor living conditions. I don't think the Jordanians are anti-monarchy, they are pro-reform. King Abdullah has been offering ""reform"" for years now, and he still is offering those promises, but the problem is actually putting the reforms into action. It maybe a ""constitutional monarchy"" on paper, but the real power remains with the royal family. 

Jordan remains ""calm"" as opposed to most of the other movements throughout the Middle East, because Jordanians actually like their King, but dislike his economic policies. Most Arab movements are looking for a ""regime change"" (i.e., Libya, Egypt, Tunisia, Yemen, etc.), Jordanians are not, so the Jordanian government feels no real reason to move with impunity. Though if that were to change, the ""classy"" attitude of the Jordanian regime would fall within seconds.

So please don't put up this front that Jordan is ""classy"" in anyway. Its ""better"" as far as Arab regimes go, but whenever I read the defense that redditors put up for Jordan it just makes me quinch. Just because King Abdullah shows up on our TV more often than other foreign leaders, has a hot wife, and is a Trekki does not make him exempt from the actions of his government. "

Two things right off the bat: 1.) Corporate personhood is a creation *of the government*, which you admitted, therefore using it as an argument against free markets is retarded. 2.) The media is an oligopoly who must get their licenses to broadcast from? Oh right, the government. So once again, using the fact that the media is made up of a handful of regime-friendly corporations hand-picked by the federal government as another argument against free markets is also very, very retarded.

So, how big is too big for a company to get? Who gets to determine that limit? What if a company gets big by providing a high-quality product that everyone loves at a reasonable price? Too bad for the consumers? Do you really not see any broader detrimental effects on the economy and society when success is systematically punished and successful companies are broken up indiscriminately for being ""too big""?

Governments have been around for thousands of years. Democracies too. Yet it was only after governments finally began to allow free enterprise, less than four centuries ago, did an enormous and unprecedented leap forward in wealth, technology, medicine, communication, and overall standard of living occur in the western world. Government handouts had absolutely nothing to do with it, and were virtually nonexistent during both the early years of the republic and the Industrial Revolution. The western welfare state is a regression, which Europe is figuring out, and which we probably won't until it's too late.

There is zero evidence to prove that the part community ownership model results in a club that is 'better run'. Fans always want increased spending, since they are voting to spend money that isn't theirs, while owners make decisions based on their own money. German clubs have as many debt problems as other clubs.

As for youth development, the Bundesliga didn't invent the model. The EPL clubs have all invested millions to produce some of the best academies in the world in the past decade. The pressure from high player transfer costs created natural circumstances where these investments are now feasible and necessary. Previously clubs in Holland, Italy and Spain developed academies because they had to - they either couldn't afford players or were restricted to quotas on how many players they could buy. For eg. in Spain you couldn't buy three 24 year old's from Argentina or Brasil, but you could buy ten 16 year olds and turn them into stars.

As for results, Bayern have won 4 Champions League titles, which is probably below-par considering the size of their revenues and their dominance of one of the biggest football playing nations. Dortmund are the only other German team to have won the Champions League, and they won it once. Germany haven't won the World Cup in 30 years.

Both the Bundesliga and the German national team have benefited from immigration laws. For a player from Eastern Europe or Asia, it is a lot easier to get a work permit to play in the Bundesliga than any other league. These same players, and children of migrants, are also actively scouted and naturalized for the national team - something that a lot of other national teams do not do.

I think this article is nothing more than a publicity campaign by the Bundesliga that has preyed well on the English mood and lack of confidence in anything that is their own. The English media has a habit of framing anything from the continent being by default better than what the English have, and as a way to describe and attempt to 'solve' the problems in the national team (blame the coach, blame the players, blame the league!)

What the spokesperson in this article was also trying to say is that the success of the national team has an increased impact on the value of the television rights of the domestic league. I don't see any evidence of that. Football TV rights in Europe have doubled in value in the past 3-4 years because of increased overall viewship, not because England or Germany are having better world cup campaigns.

To add, the Germans (and Italians) are both likely breaking EU laws on worker rights, freedom of movement and freedom of association, so they probably aren't the best model to hold up for other developing leagues. Everything else should be obvious from other successes - that is, a united negotiating model on TV rights, freedom of player movement and contracts, freedom of ownership, young player development. The Bundesliga only has two of those four."

Nearly all games don't use dedicated servers. I.e. that one of the players in each match becomes the host and everybody connects to his Xbox 360. His Xbox 360 is then responsible for sending all the required data (e.g. player positions) to every other Xbox 360. This implies that the host needs a decent internet connection (enough upload speed being the crucial factor nowadays) and he mustn't use for something else at the same time like using BitTorrent on a PC using the same connection. Another issue for us Europeans is that you're likely to be put into a match hosted by someone in the US which means increased latency for us because of the distance. Yes, for fast paced games this increase in latency alone can make a game ""unplayable"" already.

EDIT: being used to get access to decent dedicated servers in your own country for free (I played UT and UT2k3/4 a lot on my PC) I really think MS should invest some of the money we have to pay for Xbox Live into server farms (for each continent) that game developers get access to. If done properly each server could be switched to another game dynamically depending on what the people connected to Xbox Live want to play. But it requires a financial investment (for the hardware and the development of the necessary management software) that I doubt any corporation is willing to make. :(

TL;DR: Xbox Live is shitty in Europe because nearly no game uses real (dedicated) servers (which then would have to be located in Europe) and neither does the matchmaking ensure you're not getting connected to a host on another continent."

Newton was a theist, but he also had a bunch of other crazy obsessions. Dude was smart but unhinged, he also lived in a different time period, and so him being a theist is irrelevant to any modern human since we have significantly more information now.

They aren't seen as immoral in and of themselves because it's acknowledged it could happen for legitimate reasons.

Threatening war on the basis of religion, ethnicity, etc is a prelude to genocide. Even the Qur'an, a religious book, speaks of war in political terms, regarding treaties and the like, political justification for war, peace, and limits to how war is waged. Contrary to popular belief, the Qur'an doesn't call for the elimination of all non-Muslims (/facepalm).

So in war, it's possible to end things alright. It can still get out of hand on political grounds (and often does), but it's not necessary. Nothing good can come out of open ended war against an entire people (whatever their common identifier may be).

I mean, how do you reconcile with a religion? Or an ethnicity? Or an ideology? Who speaks for them? That's why the War on Terror resembles such an open ended war on Islam at times since there's no political authority on the other side that represents the enemy (and it resembles a traditional war when the enemy is specific, Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, headed by such and such... etc). The political criticism of the war in Iraq (where genocide is alleged by many in the Muslim world regarding Gulf War 1, 2, and the period inbetween) also centered around the ambiguity of it. No clear goals, exit strategy, no real way to ""end"" it. The absence of these indicates the war is not political, which is when things get dangerous.

The Cold War similarly threatened to escalate and envelope the entire world.

The Qur'an describes such war as transgressing limits. Throughout Islam's medieval history, numerous wars and battles were launched against European powers, but nothing open ended like the Crusades. The closest it got to that was when fighting for domination of resources, like how empires traditionally fought for land (and sea). Though that's obviously naturally limited because the goal is clear. The war is waged at the front lines, so even an open ended campaign for a limited resource (land) is still not the same as open ended war with no limits and no clear goals except the elimination of an abstract enemy. We don't compare Alexander to Adolf. You won't be able to tell when you've eliminated the enemy, so the campaign of elimination keeps going on.

So, fighting for oil? It can be reasonably conducted. It may not be moral, but it can still fit the mold of traditional war. This is recognized as a part of human nature generally. Fighting for stuff. Competition. Fighting against a nation can and usually does fit into this context. But fighting to wipe out people, ideologies, races, religions? That's something else. That's not human and universally panned by virtually all traditional moral systems.

Humanity's pretty clever though. How about fighting an open ended war against the idea of open ended war itself? Just blame the other guy of doing that in a pretext to do it yourself. This idea really caught on after WW2 and the Nazis. So enemies were painted as doing the thing that we (as in, the West) really were doing. That's so meta.

So this also ties into an open-ended threat against the target. Theoretically, you could wage war or political campaigns against abstract targets, but without the open-ended threat. For instance, if Nazi Germany had said ""All Jews have 6 months to pack up and leave because we don't like you. We'll provide free transportation to the border."" This sort of thing was routine when the Muslims were forced into an open-ended clash of civilization by the Crusaders. Muslims were forced into an open-ended war with Christianity itself, but they still stuck to Islamic legal doctrine and instituted ""closed"" threats and strategies in spite of the abstract target. Salahuddin, for example, and his amnesty for Christians after conquering Jerusalem for instance. He's celebrated as a tolerant ruler for evicting Christians (well, plenty of them could stay, but I think most left out of fear of reprisal by the Muslims). Because the alternative was eliminating them (as the Christians did when they slaughtered all the Muslim and Jewish inhabitants when they first conquered Jerusalem).

This is why language referring to the Crusades is extremely touchy in the Muslim world. The fact of a Christian burning a Qur'an and using inflammatory language against Islam *is* a threat, regardless of whether people want to acknowledge it or not. Muslims are sensitive to this kind of rhetoric from Christians in a manner similar to how Jews are to anti-semitism from neo-Nazis (especially since they include colonialism and that period as another sort of Crusade, so the memory of that is still fresh in their minds).

Also, classical or orthodox Islamic legal doctrine isn't often adhered to in today's world (because the secular West has convinced everyone that religion shouldn't be taken seriously... even when it is serious business), so now you have fringe movements advocating turning ""jihad"" into *Jihad*, the Muslim equivalent of a Crusade. War with no limits, war transgressing all limits (in the language of the Qur'an... punished by crucifixion in Shariah). Though the ironic thing is that they justify it by saying the West is doing it to the Muslim world and you need to fight fire with fire. Look at the rhetoric of any terrorist organization. Their primary justification is *not* the Qur'an. It's that they're responding in kind to the enemy (the West usually, sometimes Russia, or other Muslim nations, whoever). Then they throw in an attempt to justify it with random Qur'anic verses, almost as an afterthought. They don't even need it because the political message is so potent (terrorism is political in and of itself and actually less of a threat to humanity than non-political war, though it does ""transgress limits"" as the Qur'an says... and of course terrorism can be adapted into an open-ended thing)."

[**USAid Report: 2002**](http://www.wsws.org/articles/2002/aug2002/pale-a16.shtml) The report, by the US Agency for International Development, showed more than one-fifth of young Palestinian children are **malnourished.** This is more than a threefold increase since the last study two years ago. The plight of children under 5 years of age was particularly alarming. Twenty-two percent of Palestinian children under age 5 were malnourished, up from seven percent in an agency survey two years ago. Of that number, nine percent suffered from **acute malnutrition**—resulting from poor nutrition over the short term—and 13 percent suffered from **chronic malnutrition**—longer-term deficiencies that can result in stunted growth. About 20 percent of children under 5 had some form of anaemia.

[**The Red Cross Report:2008**](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/chronic-malnutrition-in-gaza-blamed-on-israel-1019521.html) The Israeli blockade of Gaza has led to a steady rise in **chronic malnutrition** among the 1.5 million people living in the strip, according to a leaked report from the Red Cross. It chronicles the **""devastating""** effect of the siege that Israel imposed after Hamas seized control in June 2007 and notes that the dramatic fall in living standards has triggered a shift in diet that will damage the long-term health of those living in Gaza and has led to alarming deficiencies in iron, vitamin A and vitamin D.

[**European Union Report 2004:**](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/palestinian-malnutrition-at-african-levels-under-israeli-curbs-say-mps-568896.html) The report said that Palestinian farmers had land confiscated, crops damaged and were “plagued” by problems in getting goods to market. MPs condemned the Israeli government for preventing the free export of goods from the West Bank and Gaza, and urged the EU to suspend Israel’s preferential tariff rates until they allow Palestinians free access to European markets. They said: ""It is hard to avoid the conclusion that there is a deliberate Israeli strategy of putting the lives of ordinary Palestinians under stress as part of a strategy to bring the population under heel"". The report said movement restrictions on the Palestinians were justified by Israel as security measures, but warned that “in reality they have been a mechanism to put pressure on the Palestinians by crippling the economy”

edit: changed *European* to *European Union.* Russia is, of course, a European country with a huge stockpile of nuclear weaponry; however I would consider the prospect of the UK entering into any kind of joint defence pact with them to be extremely unlikely for the foreseeable future."

Not really important, except for the fact that if you think paying 7k in taxes is a lot you are mistaken.

There's a reason why when a country seeks economic improvement (China, India, Brazil being good examples) it's by way of the market economy and not tax-the-rich-to-feed-the-poor. While the leftist view of economics is based on the notion of ""fairness,"" it just isn't realistic. 

A basic premise of economics is creating a hospitable business environment, and high taxes aren't attractive to the entrepreneur. We wouldn't need as many government programs to support the impoverished if those people could find work to support themselves, and if people could find work to support themselves, they would be paying taxes instead of living off of them. Win for all!

Government spending creates government jobs. While a government job is good for the person getting the paycheck, that person ultimately becomes part of the governmentmonster that needs to be fed with even more taxes. Without the incentive to do business, people don't do business. 

Yes, i am biased, but isn't everyone for one reason or another? That's like saying ""You can't rightfully argue about religion because your parents are ___ so you're biased."" It's not like my parents were born into wealth, and when I was born we weren't rich by any means. When we first came to GA (low taxes, y'know) from England we moved into a shitty apartment and had a shitty little car. My dad worked for minimum wage for a while before he got qualified for IT shit and found a better job. He doesn't have a college degree. My parents have worked their asses off over the last 20 years to give me the life I have. So as far as fairness is concerned, I don't really see it as fair when they're taxed out the ass. 

If my family was still poor and we were living off of the government, I would feel differently because the government would be feeding me. But here's the thing - the poor in America, for the most part, live far better than the poorest people in the rest of the world, and that's because we ARE a wealthy country that embraces capitalism. 

The backlash of the nanny-state that you seem to think is the answer is being felt all over Europe - the government programs that people rely on so much are no longer viable because there isn't enough revenue to support them, even if they are taxing the fucking hell out of everyone, including (and especially) the rich. Businesses leave, people leave.

I said this in /r/Christianity, and boy did they get a hard-on about an atheist openly advocating (hypothetical) murder!

Meanwhile I've changed my target of choice to Emperor Constantine:

&gt; When Christianity came under imperial favour under Constantine in the early fourth century, the Christians amounted to no more than five to ten percent of the population of the Roman Empire. [3] Even after the conversion of Constantine the growth of the religion was by no means rapid. In Antioch, certainly one of the most important and oldest centers of Christianity, during the reign of Emperor Theodosius (emperor from 379-395), Christians made up no more than twenty percent of the population which numbered about half a million. [4] These considerations show that Christianity did not spread like wildfire with its self-evident truths compelling people to immediately embrace the religion.

&gt; In fact, it is a historical fact that by the beginning of the fourth century the Christian church was already on its death throes; partly due to the persecution by the Emperor Diocletian (245-313) and due to the intense competition for converts by the rival religion, Mithraism.

&gt; **If there is one historical figure who contributed more than anybody else to the actual growth of Christianity it was, not Jesus, not Paul, but the Roman Emperor Constantine** (c274-337). Had Christianity not found favour with Constantine, and his successors, who eventually suppressed Mithraism, this ancient Persian Sun-cult could well have become the predominant religion in Europe.

&gt; When Constantine became Emperor of the reunited Roman Empire in the year 324, he gave political, legal and economic support to the Christian church. These included giving the bishops power to settle disputes between Christians, exempting all the priests from municipal taxes and giving them annual allowances. He also enacted some anti-pagan laws. [6] Some of his laws allowed the churches to enrich themselves substantially by preying on believing rich proselytes, especially the women.

&gt; The siphoning of the church for the money of these women were so bad that Emperor Valentinian (d375), fifty years after Constantine, had to command the Damasus (c304-384), Bishop of Rome to limit their extravagant donations. The successors of Constantine carried further these pro-Christian anti-pagan laws. The Emperor Honorius (384-423), for instance, enacted laws which allowed Christian church to take over the vacated pagan temples and to confiscate meeting houses and properties of those sects considered heretical. [7]

&gt; This then was how Christianity actually spread. Through some historical accident which put them in the good books of the Roman Emperor, Constantine. ... Subsequently it spread and consolidated its power through persecutions of other religions. In other words, **the cause of the rise of Christianity is not to be found in superior theology or morals, but in a ruthless political persecution of its enemies.**

* The so called ""50+1 Rule"" says that a Bundesliga Club has to own the majority of their incorporated professional football divison. This means that investors can invest into the club in the hope of profit, but cannot decide how the football division is run. The club itself is (with very rare exceptions) owned by the club members (= the fans) and democratically organized.
* German clubs do not have debts going into €100m+ like many clubs in England, Spain and maybe Italy (not sure about them). This is probably a result of the tight licensing conditions that are checked every season.
* I remember a decade ago when Ajax ruled European football; everyone was like ""we need youth development, too"". 10 years after that every football club (that has a professional divison) in Germany has own talent schools.
* You forgot that Hamburg also won the Champions League.
* The German national team won the World Cup 21 years ago. The national team performance for the last 30 years looks good i think: {82: 2nd, 86: 2nd, 90: 1st, 94: qf, 98: qf, 02: 2nd, 06: 3rd, 10: 3rd}.
* Bundesliga tickets are affordable. Here in Hamburg (= expensive for German standards) I pay 190€ for my season ticket.

Yes they do, It's just a couple of euros for chair-cars and around 15-20 euros for couchettes (at least in France). You should book these in advance as they tend to get sold out pretty quickly, especially in the tourist season. Please remember that you will need to make reservations, a Eurail pass does NOT guarantee you a seat.

&gt;Also do overnight trips count as one or two days and are there exceptions to this?

Overnight trains count as one day. The exact rule is this: If your overnight train leaves after a certain time in the evening (It's either 7 pm or 9 pm, not sure which, I think 7), then you will have to mark your pass for the next day only. There might be a problem if you're taking connecting trains on the day of boarding, because then you'll have to mark the pass for both days, but for overnight trains only it's not a problem.

&gt;Someone said that the first train trip can't be used as a 1-day overnight trip (it will count for 2 days instead). 

Not sure what you mean. I haven't heard of any such rule.

&gt;Would spaces in these trains be more or less guaranteed if we booked 4 days in advance (i.e. when we get to the destination; for the next trip)?

No way. I can guarantee you that you WON'T get a place if you book that late. At least I never get it in France, you might get lucky in Germany. In any case, I'd strongly recommend that you book as far in advance as possible.

PS: Eurail passes aren't meant for EU citizens, so you might want to skip mentioning that. Read the rules.

&gt;NATO was never designed to be an international mercenary group for the United States. It has very specific parameters on where and when the pact members are forced to help each others.
and more, all granted

NATO was designed to militarily defeat the USSR. That's gone and many Warsaw Pact countries have joined NATO. I agree NATO doesn't know what NATO's purpose is, but NATO's original purpose is long gone.

&gt;We did not abandon NATO. Remember ISAF? Remember that we still allow your troops to fly over our airspace and use Rammstein Airbase for the attacks?

I'm not saying Germany isn't still a part of NATO, just it's not still a great part of NATO.

&gt;If the Libyan people are not strong enough to get rid of their leadership by themselves, what right do we have to interfere?

I think this is irrelevant to the discussion but NATO is close to arming them and I'm sure it won't be Germany.

&gt;It is likely that Gadhaffi will survive this episode, and we really don't want to be the target of libyan-sponsored state terrorism. Lockerbie anyone?

this is your weakest argument. If your greatest defense against state-sponsored terrorism is to plea ""not me, the other guy!"" then I'm at a loss.

&gt;&gt;Meanwhile the USA pledged mutual destruction of hundreds of millions of irrelevant American third parties if West Germany was overrun by Soviet Tanks.

&gt;Excuse me for not honoring the heroes in the Golden Armors the US troops were back then, according to your thesis. The US, however, pledged MAD not for the sake of Germans, but for the sake of Britain, which would have fallen without a continental stronghold. The NATO plans for Germany were to transform it into a nuclear wasteland as soon as the first soviet tank touched our territory. We were to be destroyed by our American friends, not saved.

Well you're absolutely right, there. No more germans. It's a shame, cause I love Spaten.

The overrun of West German Defenses is what would traditionally cause full nuclear war.

&gt;It does, but German economy does effect the US, and without us (and a handful of other nations around the world), your dollars would by now be printed with six trailing zeroes. We figured having a nation of trigger-happy military supermen around might be useful - but we watch you very, very closely, especially as most Germans see the US as an example of what happened over here in the 1930s. We are ready to pull out our support to the US at hairtrigger alert.

Point is, major, widespread social/economic change increases in challenge, cost, sustainability and likelihood of failure exponentially as population increases. That's why you can't compare a giant superpower like the US (even if it isn't what it used to be) to tiny specks in Europe. Apples and oranges.

Your argument of education being a right would therefore dictate that no education should be beyond the grasp of anyone who wants it. If private colleges were able to exist but public ones were the only ones the masses could attend, all that would happen is that very quickly the education system would change to private colleges being the de-facto standard and public colleges being looked down on. And suddenly you'd have the same situation now, where a certain level of education isn't good enough if you don't have that piece of paper from the right type of establishment.

So yeah - for the US to be ""some Utopia"" you describe, than everyone should have 100% equal access to all educational and medical facilities within the country, no restrictions.

About the Foreknowledge of Pearl Harbor: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743201299/ (I would also like to include the diary of the US ambassador to Japan between 1932 and '45, Grey, but it has been out of print for a few years). There is tons of incidental proof, however, such as the order to build an 100 carrier two-ocean navy in September 1940, or the fact that to this date not all japanese decrypted messages have been released to the public record because they are considered a threat to ""national security"".

Disclaimer: I have majored in Japanese cultural studies and political sciences. 

&gt; NATO was designed to militarily defeat the USSR. That's gone and many Warsaw Pact countries have joined NATO. I agree NATO doesn't know what NATO's purpose is, but NATO's original purpose is long gone.

NATOs purpose is to stand together if ""troops, an aircraft or a ship of one or more of the undersigned nations gets attacked by a third party in the Mediterrean, the Atlantic Ocean north of the tropic of Capricorn or on its own territory."" This purpose stands till today. This was not the case in both Bosnia nor Libya.

Whatever the case, spending is unsustainable, the link I posted above has Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, who co-chaired the White House’s deficit-reduction commission last year, say that the US faces fiscal crisis within 2 years.

And Walmart's CEO is saying massive inflation is on the way:
http://www.walletpop.com/2011/04/01/walmart-ceo-predicts-inflation-on-consumer-basics/

There is a lot that is making things more expensive for the average person.  Virtually everyone says corn ethanol sucks, Consumer Reports says 10% ethanol gasoline delivers even lower mileage than .9 gallons pure gas in cars.  So basically, the whole ethanol is a charade, but Government enforces that to the pressure of the corn lobby, in detriment of everyone else.  Hell, ethanol has even been shown to be very damaging to engines.  And the practical effect is raising corn prices that raise meat prices (corn = feed), even Mexico had protests on rising food costs stemming from this the last few years.

I would also say the housing bubble started with government policy to get everyone into home ownership starting in the 1930s.  Europe has much lower homeownership, but it encourages people to live near populated areas, and through shared apartments and mass transit, much lower oil consumption (half or less per capita) than USA where the policy promoted suburbanization/ghettoization and a massive car culture that has a lot of costs.

And the insanity of the 00s was cheap mortgage rates and people losing all perspective on what a house practically was beyond a $50k meal ticket to be sold 6 months after purchase.

Banks and others encouraged it, but as far as I'm concerned, the government is a big culprit for many ills as they don't limit their scope and invite all the power grabbing and lobbying -- pointing to banks/corps/rich is a diversion tactic in that regard.

Ultimately, we as a society are failing, all these stupid decisions are interrelated and affect everyone.  Look at all the money put to imprisoning marijuana and other nonviolent drug users.  Prison is a whole nother racket.  And one costly to taxpayers.

Things will have to change, but I don't think it will happen until most average people are hit fast and hard with the consequences of the last century - instead of just piecemeal bad changes that they don't like but will live with.  It might come the next 2 years but I have no doubt America will be very different by the end of the decade, if it's nothing else but austerity measures."

You can't do that with Nazi soldiers, barely with people like Schindler (for every who in Germany you can find dozen in the other occupied countries), so you go for a group easily victimized: women.

Is it really that hard to understand the dynamic here? An army, having seen no women for months, having killed and maimed, seen their brothers in arms killed and being used to taking what they want by force, the only thing stopping these soldiers from rape would have been their superiors oder. Since the Russian generals had no intentions of doing that, feeling it was a spoil of war like anything else, rapes happened.

Last Thursday I met a guy from Ukraine solo in a bar. He joined the conversation of me and my wing. Nice guy in the end, but I did have that social alarm go off like ""is this dude alone?"".

However, most of it is not religiously based, and where it IS religiously based, it involves Muslims. Somalia is under the control of fundamentalist Muslim warlords. Southern Sudan had to break off from main Sudan because its Christian population was under threat from Muslims. (The exception is Nigeria, where Muslims and Christians both have way too much blood on their hands.) In most of West Africa, the dangerous places to go are those that are under control of extremist Muslim elements (as in the case of Northern Mali). 

Until the very recent backlash in some European countries, Muslims have generally been given free reign to do what they want in democratic countries. Some states in Nigeria are even allowed to impose Sharia law. However, the isn't generally untrue. The public practice of anything other than Sunni Islam is criminal under Saudi law. On Christmas70 Christians were arrested in Iran on the ""suspicion"" of trying to convert Muslims (http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110111/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iran_christian_crackdown).

Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Iran, the UAE, Bahrain, etc., are not poor. There is plenty of money in Dubai. Iran, as a country, is very well educated. To say that their repressive and violent attitudes are based on poverty or lack of education is silly. There are plenty of places where poor people manage to contain the urge to blow up everything in sight. The common thread in these places is often Islam. "

I did four months around Europe last summer by myself (25/f). A lot of things are closed in Italy for August but I wouldn't avoid it just because of that. Italy is amazing - I highly suggest Cinque Terre for a couple days if you like swimming and hiking. The touristy stuff in Rome is always open in the summer. I can't recommend Florence enough. Seriously, I stayed there for three weeks and had a blast. 

Honestly, I never did the Eurail. From other people, it just looked like more trouble than it was worth. It's cheap to get last minute plane tickets and in the summer, lots of people have problems getting sleeper cars. In a lot of countries, it's just not cost effective. France and Spain, yeah but Italy and anything in Eastern Europe is just not worth it. You have four months so you probably won't be jumping around a whole lot. Plus, if your plans are fluid, there's a really good chance you'll change your mind - meet people who are going different places, want to see something out of the way. 

My best tip: Do not, I repeat, DO NOT OVERPACK! Believe me, you don't need half the stuff you bring. Someone just posted a guide on packing and it's wonderful. You don't want to be the tourist dragging a broken roller bag along the cobblestones in Brussels. It'll make you miserable. I did four months out of a backpack (LL Bean rucksack) and just replaced clothing as I wore stuff out. Plus, I got to come back with a new wardrobe! 

And start getting used to talking to everybody. Even if you're not a super social person (I'm really not), you learn the best stuff by talking to people. Learn a couple lines for every country you go to, ask people to teach you their language, ask where to eat, what to see, where to go next. 

Oh shit, and if you're looking for something to do, Pueblo Ingles. Seriously, look it up. It's a free week at a resort talking to people in English. I went to Coto de Valle and had a blast. If you're anything like me, you're going to get a little sick of backpacking every month or so. It's nice to work in somewhere you plan to stay for a week or so, do something helpful and just relax a little. Traveling alone is stressful and making every single decision for yourself is taxing. 

Also, look into solid shampoos so you're not messing with liquids everywhere. Lush has a really great shampoo/conditioner bar. 

I can't really help you with the return ticket. Sorry. But if you have any other questions, I'm not an expert by any means but I know it's super scary the first time and I have a fair bit of experience at this point. You're going to have a blast. "

You are right on the technicalities with directive/implementation (I used the original title of the article which mentions ""data retention law"" to make it simpler for people not familiar with intricacies of EU directives etc.)

Though from the ruling itself, the court de facto rejected the policy - *the obligation to store the communication data is cancelled*.

Data that were stored are mentioned in decree [485/2005, paragraph 2](http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=cs&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fportal.gov.cz%2Fwps%2Fportal%2F_s.155%2F701%2F.cmd%2Fad%2F.c%2F313%2F.ce%2F10821%2F.p%2F8411%2F_s.155%2F701%3FPC_8411_number1%3D485%2F2005%26PC_8411_p%3D2%26PC_8411_l%3D485%2F2005%26PC_8411_ps%3D10%2310821) (google translate link, but it's quite readable). Section (4) deals with internet - IP, port numbers, URL, result status (means both TCP/IP and HTTP states), amount of traffic, encrypted/unencrypted...

Ad the ""over national laws"": in theory true, in practice it's just one huge mess (fresh experience).

&gt; A new law with a similar effect will no doubt be passed by the Czech government in short order.

Iuridicum Remedium, the NGO that pushed for the rejection of the directive, did so since 2005 and they have pretty good track record of overturning stupidities in laws and privacy cases. I'm sure they won't let a new law ""just slip through"" when they spent five years working on the data retention case.

Why would you want to give up partial independence and massive financial subsidy in favour of being entirely beholden to Dublin, minus all the money? For a United Ireland? Well what use is that? Why is that any more valid a dream than a United British Isles?

Intuition is an off hand term to refer to that faculty of our mind that produces ""necessary knowledge"" *without our choice in the matter*. The key is necessary knowledge, that's the term that's used all the time in philosophy/theology. This is sometimes called ""immediate perception"", and al-Farabi calls them ""primary principles"" (this term is particular to him and other Islamic philosophers of the Peripatetic/Aristotelian school... because even all Islamic Neoplatonists were really just Aristotelian deep down inside). So, just as the knowledge that 1 + 1 = 2 or that a whole is greater than a part, etc.

Deduction is necessary knowledge which we come to by choice.

So we can see that these early philosophers in trying to reconcile Islamic theology (which was Realist and very pro-induction, empiricism, skepticism) with Greek rationalism first tried to rationalize induction to the level of deduction. And it's not a bad argument. Perhaps induction is just in our nature and we have no choice but to use it? It's subject to greater error than deduction, but we can weed out that error (thus inductive experimental methodology was born... something the Greeks didn't do). So the focus shifted from not justifying induction as some infallible thing, but to things which could lead to errors in induction (skepticism). And that works. I mean, as we know, you don't need to solve the problem of induction to do science. You need to make that leap of faith or take that risk (however you prefer putting it) on induction and then you're like ""well, that wasn't so bad"", and it continues. 

Anyway, it didn't last long. Over time the philosophers who became overly enamored of Greek rationalism split from the Orthodoxy of Islamic theology and became known as the Mutazilah. They decided they liked philosophy better than science, and even religion. Their science was... bad science. Though their philosophy was popular in Europe (where people were getting sick of Christianity) and some of the best Rationalist philosophy around. So they started speculating in theology and tried to conform Islamic theology to their own conclusions (the whole revelation vs. reason debate).

So once they got the attention of the theologians and earned their ire, a Skeptic (as theologians tended to be in Islam) from the developing orthodox theological school of Al-Ash'ari named Al-Ghazali came along who wielded the problems of causation and induction like sledgehammers and single handedly destroyed the Peripatetic school. I wouldn't say he particularly enjoyed it, it was kind of like having to put down your favorite pet who despite being your best friend had unfortunately contracted rabies. :( 

The final form of orthodox theology (the creeds of al-Ash'ari and his theological brother from another mother, al-Maturidi) put induction back into its traditional place in philosophy (not equal to deduction obviously) and found another fix (which came from how they addressed the problem of causation). They also defended their theologies from the Skeptics of other traditions (the Greeks of course and the even trickier Skeptics from India/Persia (Pantheists, man... )). If you want to know more about that, I could cobble together a bit from other posts I've made here and there.

Also, I got the sense from reading some of those later texts that the problem of causation is really a problem of deduction, but I don't know why it's not discussed in Western philosophy like that?"

&gt; Pope John Paul II, with a hopeful eye on the future of China as a Catholic nation, has given its non-Christian population a large number of saints. He has canonized all those he could find in China's traumatic past under the Church. Those canonized include European missionaries and Chinese converts known for their criminal behaviour.

From [Archbishop Stepinac - a war criminal beatified](http://freetruth.50webs.org/A7d.htm#BeatifiedStepinac):

&gt; Archbishop of Zagreb, Aloysius Stepinac, was the head of the Catholic Church in Yugoslavia. Beatified by the previous Pope, John Paul II, Stepinac was pro-Nazi. He not only knew of the crimes of the Ustashe and the priests, but he supported them and the forced conversions of Serbs. After the war, he was convicted for war crimes. 
Stepinac was a supporter of National Socialism (Nazism for short) and its dictatorial regimes in Europe, as seen in his publication.

## Beatification of another shady priest 

&gt; When Pope John Paul II visited Banja Luka in June 2003 he proclaimed the beatification of the Catholic priest Ivan Merz there, the founder of the Association of Croatian Eagles, later associated with the Hitlerjugend.

----

&gt; In 1994, Pope John Paul II made Kurt Waldheim a Knight of the Ordine Piano, an order instituted by Pius IX in 1848 to honour those who've rendered ""outstanding service to Church or society"". Israel and Jewish organisations protested the papal knighthood that the Pope bestowed on Waldheim.

----

The Vatican's Holocaust Report - NY Times (Editorial), 18 March 1998:

John Paul, however, has resisted a critical look at the Catholic response to the Holocaust and has defended the silence of Pope Pius XII during the Third Reich. The Vatican document echoes his views. It concludes that the church teachings, though often hostile to Jews, did not contribute to the crude anti-Semitic ideology of the Nazis, many of whose leaders were Catholics and whom the Vatican calls ""neo-pagan.""

----


If you're going to say something, say it. Prior to Pope John Paul's Easter 2000 pilgrimage to Jerusalem, Catholic leaders made the grandstanding announcement that he planned to express ""regret"" for the Crusades, the Inquisition, and other ""faults of the past."" (The ""past"" does not have faults. People do.) But when John Paul finally offered his ""apology,"" it defined vagueness. He might just as well have shrugged his shoulders and said, ""Shit happens."" He made no mention of the Inquisition, Crusades, or Holocaust; or the centuries when the Catholic liturgy included asking for protection from ""the perfidious Jews;"" or the church's intense bigotry against gays and women. Calling that a landmark proclamation is preposterous. 

## The Vatican is Guilty of Genocide 

&gt; Today Pope John Paul II claims Pius XII was innocent, the Vatican was innocent, the Church was innocent. For all these years it has kept its archives closed, claiming it has nothing to hide. But we know otherwise. Even without the Vatican's archives we have sufficient evidence to find not only Pius XII, but Pope Paul VI (then Cardinal Montini, Pius XII's closest advisor) and the entire Vatican guilty of crimes of genocide. 

----

&gt; We know that the Vatican was very enthusiastic about the thousands of forced conversions of persecuted people who converted to Catholicism in order to stay alive and that the Vatican sent notes of encouragement to the Croatian clergy, though warning them that they should not accept conversions of adults who were not sincere....

&gt; We know from his diary that Stepinac was an arch anti-Semite. And we know how staunchly Pius XII defended Stepinac after the war, even after his trial and conviction for war crimes in 1946, rewarding him with the robes of a Cardinal, calling him a martyr. Indeed, every Pope since Pius XII has called Stepinac a martyr including the current Pope who hints at Stepinac's beatification, and who has worshipped at his tomb. John Paul II will travel once again to Croatia this October to celebrate the Ustasha clergy. But the only real martyrs were those who died at the hands of the Catholic gangsters. Pius XII and Stepinac as far as we know never personally murdered anyone, but what they did was far worse than any single murder: they supported a triple genocide of Serbs, Jews and Romas in fascist Croatia that cost a million lives.

&gt; We know that the Vatican aided in the escape of thousands of war criminals from Croatia and all other parts of Yugoslavia. Although Vatican representatives and Stepinac's representatives visited Jasenovac [concentration camp] several times, they did nothing to rescue the victims.

Why are you assuming that such attraction is genetic and not societally ingrained? Why are you assuming that being tall is solely a genetic determination instead of at least partially the result of un-natural sociological practices such as sustainable agriculture? You made a claim that tall Dutch people resulted from drinking milk, combined with an evolutionary process of some sort, but your timescale is a century - that's not evolution, that's better nutrition.

Europe is an extremely diverse collection of nations. It also affords no opportunity or avenue that isn't available in America. There are smart/dumb, kind/cruel people in roughly the same measure as in America (except in American culture, people talk to strangers more).

If you want to go to visit some foreign places that might be interesting or might be shit, then great. But building ""europe"" up as some fantasy that will somehow make you or your life better, more respectable, more interesting, or make you some accomplished person or whatever, then you're going for the wrong reasons.

It's psychologically appealing to attach the negatives of your present situation, with the geographical location of your present situation, and to build up another place as an answer to getting away from those negatives.

I work for a UK-based company. It just... feels like it would be home. As for the cost, I understand it's quite expensive, but having supported myself alone in NYC for the past 9 years, I'm definitely up on how to find bargains and live in the cheap. :) 

I would be looking for a one-way ticket as I know that's much cheaper - I saw one on kayak for $417. From there, I might end up going elsewhere in Europe for a while, but I'll have enough time in London to sort of figure out what I want my next move to be. 

Also, I stopped smoking weed months ago. :) Couldn't justify the cost and I was sorta getting to the point where I was relying on it as a coping mechanism whenever I got anxious about something, so I cut it off. Plus my partner at the time hated it b/c it'd make me paranoid and we'd fight. So yes, your answer = $0!"

No, you're not. You're giving examples that are plainly resultant from societal change rather than biological change, and societal pressures are not natural selection. Societal pressures are not selection by a natural environment, they are selection by the environment that humans have created in a directed and artificial manner.

&gt;It makes no difference - it's still evolution by natural selection. If the example of tall people in Holland is confusing you, think about it in terms of male birds being brightly coloured. The brighter they are, the more females select them. Now think about how that plays out with tall men - there is a clear sexual preference for tall men therefore tall genes are naturally selected.

You have not shown that such a preference is not societal rather than biological. In fact, your example of Dutch people growing appreciably taller in just a century contradicts your argument rather than supporting it, and attempting to compare people with birds is weak, because behaviourally they are not comparable.

The increased prevalence of lactose tolerance in Europeans in recent centuries is not a result of natural selection. It is a result of systematized agriculture. If not for the bovine dairy industry, lactose tolerance wouldn't even be a factor."

Now, concering what you said about European Liberalism (and I'll also focus on the special case of Portugal):

1) In Europe, the word ""liberal"" still retains some of its original meaning - a classical liberal. Nonetheless, a Liberal Party in Europe is much more close to the ""social liberalism"" of Rawls, J.S. Mill, et al., than the ""Libertarianism"" of von Mises, Nozick, Rothbard, etc. It's actually pretty difficult to see someone to defend ""less state"" (I'm not even talking about a minimal state here, I'm talking about reducing the state).

2) There are actually some ""Liberal"" parties on Europe - the Free Democratic Party in Germany, the Moderate Party in Sweden and the Liberal Democrats from England being the prime examples. None of them defend Classical Liberalism in a consistent manner. Also, they usually try a coalition with the Conservatives (keep in mind that Conservatism in Europe is also a tad different from American Conservatism), so it's difficult to push a ""liberal agenda"" (and I hate this expression) - but this depends from country to country, being more easy on the North-east and much, much more difficult on the South-west

3) In Portugal, it's actually very, very difficult to be a Liberal - even if you accept some sort of state intervention. Due to the massive amount of marxist influence on our society (our ""Carnation Revolution"" 35 years ago had the objective to implant a ""copy"" of URSS in Portugal), it's very difficult to try to explain basic economic concepts like the law of supply and demand - and if you say something like ""the minimum wage actually hurt the poor"", you'll get some reactions that go from the ""omg, you're such a fucking pig"" to ""if you say something like that again, I'll hurt you and your family"". 

Let me give you one example: in Portugal, we only have one corporation that manages fuel distribution in our territory (GALP); it was a state owned corporation until its privatization, some years ago - now, the State grants GALP's monopoly by law; due to this (and also due to the massive taxes that our fuel prices incorporate), Portugal has one of the highest prices in Europe, although our medium income is below the European average; do you know what's the most common solution to this problem? ""GALP should be nationalised again"" or ""the State should impose a price cap"". It's really rare to see someone trying to say ""let's try to lower the taxes"" or ""let's free the market""

I know like 3 or 4 people in real life that can be called ""liberals"". And on the internet, only 2 or 3 that can be called ""libertarians"". We have no liberal party, and our ""liberal"" movement is composed by people who think that ""economic freedom"" is an euphemism to ""let's enslave the poor"".

If you try to study Economics during High School (which I did), you're taught that the markets don't work, that liberalism is outdated and that socialism is a good thing. If you try a BSc in Economics (which I'm currently enduring), you get the usual ""OMG I LOVE KEYNES""-thing - although that's more notorious on the Macroeconomics-influenced classes, the Microeconomics are actually good.

So, yes, I'm pretty ""forever alone"". ^_^"

I was in a particularly terrifying situation when I was running before dawn one time and I thought something awful was going to happen with this car that was trailing me, but nothing came of it and I can't honestly say this caused some sort of crisis in me.

That being said, I *am* terrified of death. The whole of my friends are atheists, and so I'm completely aware of their views on the matter and how they've accepted it. (""Accepted"" is probably a poor choice, because it's not that they've ""accepted"" it in a bad way. They're at peace with it. Some I think are even looking forward to the day that they can rest in peace after living a good life.)

Anyways, I really can't say. It's like asking me why I like chocolate. It just recently got to the point that I can't deny that I believe there's a monotheistic God. The ramifications of my faith on my view of death and other things though, the way I see it. are effects rather than causes of my faith.

That being said, I believe it may have to do with my cultural heritage and upbringing. I do believe in a monotheistic God. Not a life force. Not something else. In *some* ways this is an arbitrary distinction. The best explanation I can come up with is that being European, and being brought up European (I mean European not to mean not American (which I actually am), but that I wasn't brought up or have cultural ties to Asian faiths, the Middle Eastern faiths, and so on.), has given me a natural propensity in that direction.

In his statement he asked that people refrain from using flash photography as it interferes with the projections.

It just makes sense to make sure David's performance ends up on the BluRay &amp; DVD.  At least, it does to me... hahaha We shall see!

Personally, I think that the second is actually pretty close to the truth.  Libertarianism would not make much sense to someone from a collectivist world view, such as that shared by many cultures in Asia.  Many of the other countries in Europe have a conceptual belief that they have the primarily have the right to a *good* government rather than the right to be free from a *bad* government.

Extreme libertarian beliefs also, in my opinion, require low population density.  It is a lot harder to find people that argue that there should be no government at all, discounting anarchists squatting in a warehouse, in urban environments than in more rural environments.  The United States has a much lower [population density](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_population_density) than most other first world nations.  More importantly, when our nation's ideals were being founded historically that difference was even more extreme.  It is a lot easier to argue that you should be free from anyone's control when you are living in a log cabin out in the woods, than living in a small apartment in downtown Paris.  

Finally, the colonies had a pretty unique experience in that they were truly free from an oppressive government for most of their history.  While there were issues with England, the Americans never suffered the type of oppression that most other colonies such as those in Africa, Latin America or Asia experienced.  For those not in colonial areas, the history of having a government goes back for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.  Therefore, the American colonists had a unique perspective of being largely unregulated, except by local bodies and could develop some longstanding political beliefs that would be quite foreign to other cultures.

For these reasons, I think that the colonial history, individualism and principles incorporated in the constitution are all very relevant when discussing libertarianism, as expressed in this subreddit.  This is also why I believe that the more extreme views expressed in this subreddit are not realistic as we approach an increasingly urban and integrated world.  As much as people may believe that no government has the right to control their lives, the reality is that dense populations have always required intrusive governments.  Our time is best spent on fighting for a *good* government that recognizes as many freedoms as possible, rather than the impossible."

What I've been looking for, however, is the ability to use your phone itself as a fax machine. That is, the phone itself should be able to use the cell phone line to directly talk to another fax machine by initiating a phone call to it, and sending along a photo.

In order to do this, the app actually has to have access to the incoming and outgoing audio streams of the phone call. It needs to listen to the sounds made by the other fax machine, and make sounds of it's own in response. Android supports this feature. It's a feature that's also useful for recording phone calls, which is why it was requested in the first place. In practice, however, it doesn't work.

Your phone has two main processors in it - the system processor (the one that gets all the press, such as the Snapdragon), and the baseband processor (which handles CDMA / GSM modem functionality, and is often part of a system-on-chip that includes the system processor as well).

The problem here is that the baseband processor is the one dealing with the audio streams, and the system processor is the one that Android is running on. The phone manufacturer would have to intentionally build their hardware and baseband firmware in such a way that the baseband processor makes those audio streams available to the system processor.

Unfortunately for us, no notable American or European handset is configured this way. There's a (Korean?) version of the Galaxy S floating around that supports this properly, and *maybe* it's possible to implement it for *some* other phones with a custom ROM, but we're basically screwed on this one.

I had just gotten back from a wonderful spring break spent in Arizona - where the average weather was 80 and sunny without a single cloud in the sky - to an [unforgivably](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dJu1Jj7VTw) cold, 20 and snowy NY winter. Needless to say I had been spoiled by the warmth and wasn't looking forward to having to drive home in the cold. My car's heat takes about 15 minutes to actually warm up, plus it had been having battery troubles for the past few weeks, so I wasn't even sure if it would start up after a week of sitting in the lot.

I got to my car, said a prayer, and by the grace of Mary Jane, it turned on without even the slightest complaint. After at most 5 minutes of paying the ticket and whatnot, I turned on the heat - and it was already pumping hot air! ""Thanks, car!"" I squealed with joy as I put my hands up to the vents... and a second later, the radio changed songs - to Queen's [You're My Best Friend.](http://listen.grooveshark.com/s/You+re+My+Best+Friend/1VDbhY?src=5) I realized then, with my car blasting that song for me, and me reveling in the AWWWWWness of it all... I love my car, guys.

I mean, she's not the most attractive, and she has some problems - don't get me wrong. She's pretty slow, and huge at that. She guzzles gas, especially in my hilly town, and she smells kinda funky inside. Her battery's dying, the heat takes forever to turn on (and the AC is completely shot), and she's got a lot more scratches, dings, and dents than her trendy Japanese and European friends... 

But despite her problems, I love her because we're always up for going places and doing things together as a perfect team, no matter what the circumstance. For example, a few weeks ago, I drove her 700 miles in three days just to go to the end of Restaurant Week in NYC, and that was *with* her battery problems... what a trooper. Sometimes we hang out just for fun, and just putter around listening to music for hours. Sometimes I yell and scream at her about my life, my ex, my family, school, or whatever else is pissing me off, and I know she's okay with that. Sometimes we get in trouble together, but I know I can trust her with those secrets too. And sometimes, we just enjoy going someplace, turning off, and relaxing.

A few weeks ago, I was pissed off at her for all of the problems she was having. I realize now I have a best friend that loves me and will do anything with me unquestioningly and to the end. Love you too, car. :')"

I'm not sure legislation on privacy would be constitutional. It could also be a tool for the powerful to silence dissent. Therefore, I think that it should be very carefully debated back and forth, and implemented the constitutional amendment level.

1. Low interest rates and poor regulation led to one of the largest property bubbles anywhere in history. When Lehman Bros went under, investors in Irish banks got spooked and they couldn't access credit. The banks came to government claiming that they were facing a liquidity crisis, which was serious, but by its nature short term. The government responded by guaranteeing all of the banks' liabilities. It later emerged that the banks were in fact *insolvent* not illiquid and over the ensuing two years €70bn would have to be injected into the banks.

2. During the property boom, the government reduced income taxes and increased spending to win elections. It was able to this because the tax receipts from property transactions were so high. When the bubble burst, this income dried up. This was compounded by the fact that most employment growth between 2002 and 2008 was in the construction sector. As these people lost their jobs they joined the dole queue increasing the government's spending commitment.

The [government's budgetary response](http://www.irisheconomy.ie/index.php/2011/03/22/behaving-like-teenagers/) and the public acceptance of it is, by historical standards, impressive. However, the outstanding sovereign liabilities are now so high that Ireland appears to be entering a debt spiral - the deflation from cutting further and faster will eviscerate the budget surpluses needed to repay our debts.

Corporation tax is only linked to this problem in a very indirect way. The peripheral budget crises in Europe arose because those countries didn't undertake the discipline needed in a monetary union where interest rates are matched to the exigencies of the core countries. Interest rates were extraordinarily low during the last decade because of Germany's economic malaise. Peripheral governments like Ireland and Greece should have dampened demand through taxing and spending. Instead they did the opposite. To prevent this problem afflicting the Eurozone again, the core countries want to harmonise a number of economic policies, among them corporation tax. This, however, will have no effect on the current crisis (at least as far as Ireland in concerned) which will most likely require investors in Irish banks to take a hit for investing in reckless institutions.

I'm uncertain about how much sense the harmonisation of a corporate tax base, or tax rates, makes. I know the motives behind them aren't the most rational - in Ireland the 12.5% rate has become a sacred cow and in Germany and France attacking it is a useful way to impress voters angry about bailing out insolvent sovereigns. In reality, Ireland budget problems are totally unrelated to corporation tax (it makes up a greater share of government revenue than the [EU average](http://www.ronanlyons.com/2010/11/16/and-its-hard-to-craft-a-budget-when-youre-watched-by-olli-rehn-open-letter-to-soon-to-be-european-overlords/).) Ireland is also unusual in that its average corporation tax rate (after loopholes and exceptions) is very close to its headline rate (about 11%) In contrast there is a difference of about 25 percentage points between [France's](http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2011/0323/1224292848181.html) average and headline rates. Ireland also lacks easy access to large ports and European transport routes. This makes it heavily reliant on services and high value manufacturing, which are notoriously footloose. In attracting these MNCs Ireland is competing as much with jurisdictions like Switzerland, Israel and Singapore as Germany and France.

Ireland tax rate obviously does bestow it with a competitive advantage, and [some MNCs](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39784907/ns/business-bloomberg_businessweek/) do abuse it, but on the whole I think its a legitimate and necessary economic strategy with benefits for Ireland and the EU."

You seem far too convinced that religion wants this identity-only version of belief in its followers.  Don't you feel a bit fanatical with this a priori reasoning here?  The identity-only belief is what has destroyed many churches by changing them from religions into any-group-they-want-to-be.   The IRA and the Mujahadeen and the Tamil Tigers.

&gt; here is the common denominator: religion and government are both capable of inciting hatred and sanctioning violence, murder and unspeakable acts.

News flash from Captain Obvious:  Religion and Government are the ONLY two assemblages of HUMAN BEINGS.  Humans do this sort of thing everywhere they ever put their bloodstained hands.  THAT's the common denominator, silly person.  Now you're sounding nuts.

&gt; at least governments require some level of diplomacy and good relations to thrive.

You been watching the news?  Lunacy beyond belief!  Government can sustain itself simply by making a change too difficult or complex!

&gt; even though most religions at the core teach others to be kind and respectful to others, this message is almost NEVER practiced.

You apparently have nothing but a cartoon-land to live in.  Don't you even KNOW where some of your own culture and morals and sense of politeness came from?  You sprung from the ground whole?  If you studied anthropology you'd know common Western sensibilities are not universal.  Many or all descended from Medieval Christendom and, in fact the Reformation.  Loyalty to tribe is all that's required by evolution... and you'd have only that if you were a 'natural' human.  It logically is all you need too.

&gt;  because [religion's abuse is] all about what it means to other people and how it manifests in a society.

The guns and the bullets and the poverty and the corruption and the fear didn't do it... it was de DAMM CHURCHES!!!!   STOP THEMMM!!!!  Something tells me your logic about what 'manifests' is profoundly bigoted and short-sightedly irrational.  Hateful.

I'd have no means of trusting your bizarre leaps of logic.  ""Causes of things"" viewed by outsiders would make you believe that tidal waves cause birth defects, cancer and hair loss in Japan.  You need to know the internals instead of the utterly surface-only level!!

&gt; all progress that the west has made... because ... it was able to put a leash on religion and make it irrelevant or unimportant in the decision-making process

I think you have it the other way around.  It was done because religion was changed from being entwined with foul land-owner-governments and put back into people's personal behavior and well-being, just as Jesus (and others) walked around preaching it originally.  It came from the people back again to gov't and guided many many many policies later.  Anti-slavery measures.  Anti-child-labor laws.  Even trust-busting came from the sense of equality among people that the US treasures unlike those who liked a monarchy or aristocracy.  Religion and the Enlightenment were heavily linked, but were removed from government... because people needed education... to become effectively learned about their country and family faith.

Corruption and class nobility and the resulting moral relativism were the targets of the US revolution.  The vast single-tree hierarchy of monarchy-government and patronage was the old culture.  The US were the MORE religious Puritain crazies in the US that got it done.  There were no actual 'holy' theocracies in Europe but only mini-versions of the Roman aristocracy: praying plebians go here and prattling patricians go here.

&gt; society became rational

You've not been paying attention to US history.  The Enlightenment was a hope for rationality, assuredly, but mostly by promoting universal and personal roles in Liberty / Equality and individual Enlightenment itself.  That was sacrilege in old Europe.  After the US was started in earnest it became a bundle of hillbillies, merchants, drunkards, land barons in the South and people who were still sick of it all trying to escape farther West.  

Most issues that appear rationally derived in the US were because no hierarchy was in place and fighting-the-powers was always a option because everyone was new. More importantly because no one believed the government and the church were the same corrupt pile.  Government was expected to fester, but it was never as wholly corrupt and lost as monarchies made it.  The church became that much more potent as a pure ideological message.. one they used over and over to correct government.  Note: **it wasn't because US citizens believed a rationality guided government presided over them**.

You have a cultic and irrational belief that rationality is/was widespread in the US.  The US has had a very poor history of education and enlightenment.  Media and patriotism-stories could make any narrative they wanted for most Americans, as long as the group that noticed would buy papers or expect their kids to know ""the correct history"".   What has saved us is the inability to pay all our allegiance to one hierarchy that all power-givers cling to, ALLOWING a philosophy of weak and powerless pastors and priests to stick to a timeless message.

Yes.. by the way... the US is back on course with old Europe, sadly.  More happily, post-war Europe is in a renaissance of cultural/temporary rationality, based on joint economic interest.  Still it is teetering as various crises hit it.  We shall see how long rationality-by-cultural-politeness holds out."

In layman terms when the US imports more than it exports, it means investors from other countries have to buy US assets to keep the dollar from falling. In other words if the US imports more than it exports, foreign investors must buy dollar-denominated assets like bonds or treasury securities in order to offset the difference.

Economic theory is very simple. Demand increases value. For example, ""if French investors saw an opportunity in the U.S., they might be willing to pay more euros in order to get dollars to invest in the U.S."" More euros per dollar means the dollars value has risen.

There is a large amount of demand for dollars because most countries accept dollars as currency when buying from other nations. If you are China and you buy a million barrels of petroleum from Saudi Arabia you will be paying with US dollars. The amount of world trade around the world is mostly done in the reserve currency which means the demand for dollars is enormous despite the increasing circulation.

At the moment thanks to Chinas investment the US is being supported but that won't last forever. A lot of trade between nations is being switched to different currencies. The Chinese and Russians do trade with each other without the help of the US dollar. As trade grows between Asia and Europe soon both continents will bypass the dollar.

It largely hinges on China though. China buy and sell trillions of dollars of things every year. If they dumped the currency the circulation would outweigh the demand and that would have a drastic effect on the dollar. Basically you may need a hundred dollars to buy a can of beans depending on the circulation.

At the moment though China are creating enormous amounts of demand for the US dollar. Even the oil they buy brings in hundreds of billions and is all traded in the US dollar. If they stopped supporting the US dollar?

Well you know all those ridiclous doomsday theories everybody has? Well if that did happen those theories would not be so ridiculous anymore. If the dollar was dumped it would effectively cripple the US.

The world currency being dropped is just about the worst case scenario for the US. I mean it can't get much worse than that. Look up Zimbabwe to see what happens with hyper inflation and when circulation is much higher than demand."

For centuries, the Chinese have raised special breeds of dogs, like the black-tongued chow, for chow, and many European countries still have laws on the books regarding postmortem examination of dogs intended for human consumption.

&gt;Do you have an answer for why we eat sweet, cute pigs and cows? 

Yes. They are delicious, and farmed for consumption. Without farming, cows would not exist in the wild. They would have gone extinct long ago. Their bodies are used in their entirety. Every single part of the cow and pig are used in products of all kinds."

The problem is the debt is accelerating and the deficit will only grow. It's funny because China on the one hand is rescuing the US but on the other hand over the long term China is killing the US.

During the 60's America had a huge advantage because due to World War 2 all the infrastructure in Europe was destroyed and the US had an opportunity to trade with the world. The world was buying more from the US than the US was buying from the rest of the world.

What happened was the US economy started increasing its own cash reserves while Europe was being leeched dry. The US would then give money to Europe and charge them interest. So the US was making a fortune through a deficit and then making money through interest too.

This is kind of the same situation except it is much much bigger and it is at a much worse time. The US needs to find a way to compete with China on trade volume and not let China capture the European market.

At the moment nearly everything in Europe is made in China. I mean from motherboards to computer mouses, tea cups and numerous other things. China's trade is growing and Europes money is going to China. There is less demand for US products which means factories are closing and numerous job postings are disappearing.

It's a shitty position to be in because the US hasn't got the money to invest in infrastructure on a large scale and there is no real demand for many of those products in the first place.

Cheap labour is only a temporary problem(though certainly one). Infrastructure is really really really really expensive. Building a big infrastructure is extremely fucking expensive.

P.S. Did I mention infrastructure is expensive? Seriously most countries have plenty of workers and most countries have cheap labour its just so expensive to get the infrastructure built for millions of workers."

The Mongols destroyed Arab civilization. The Turks took over but the Ottoman Empire was a military empire so their advancements were in warfare, engineering, technology, etc. not sciences like physics/chemistry/etc

Same for the Mughals (the ""gunpowder empires"").

From there it was a long slow decline. The Muslim world rose to the top really quick then got lazy and drunk off materialistic excess. Like the Romans before them. The Turks briefly revived things but then fell into the same situation and also faced a resurgent Europe fueled by an unsustainable capitalist economic model (which is finally falling apart a mere 200 years later). Typical civilization life-cycle. Population becomes lazy, spoiled, and distracted (the Romans turned to hedonism, the Muslims turned to overly indulgent and deviant forms of spirituality which made them too distracted to stay on top of worldly obligations). Government becomes a monolithic bureaucracy. Economic troubles loom over the horizon. Random wars are waged for resources to try and stay afloat. Classical science stagnates in favor of military applications (new addition from the model of the Islamic decline I guess) etc

Government employed scientists are not supposed to criticize government policy. That is the job of the opposition. They should lay out the facts and leave it at that. However, it is sometimes hard to do so. There has always been discussion with how much government scientists should be able to say to the public.

Some people went, some people are too young, or too old, or whatever. We are talking probably about a constant chunk of people during any given year looking into college education. what that number is i really couldn't say, I'd have to see some statistics or something. 

The united states economy is massive compared to countries in Europe. i think that with smarter management of our money we could make state colleges available for free, for those who are able to place into them - like it is now, but without having to pay a bunch of money. College education would of course, never be compulsory. You said it yourself, we area superpower - and I would agree. 

The argument you make about private schools you make is just false. What you are describing is a class struggle between those who are able to pay for college, and those who are not. Students able to pay - students who are able to investigate loans, understand the terms behind the loans, and most importantly actually afford the multitude of loans that any college student is required to have - would of course go to the private schools. While the others, would go to the private institutions. 

This is exactly how the public and private education system works currently on the college and sub college level. One class of citizens gets in the line to the left, and the other gets in the line to the right. I could talk about the funding disparities in public education, and how the system obviously needs to be completely overhauled and given an absolutely larger amount of money but I'll spare you that boring stuff. I imagine you went to a nice public school in the suburbs of a big city, but you should be aware of the public counterparts in the inner city that have a fraction of the funding coming from property taxes as you did in the suburbs. This of course leads to glaring inequities in the quality of education, and further exacerbates the differences in cultural and social capital between these two groups. one of them goes to college(again, not everyone - its a mixed bag), and the other does not.

It would be a mistake to assume that members of both groups all belong to the ""I want to go on to higher education"" camp, but it would be an even graver mistake to say that only a small amount of them wish too. The problem is that only a small amount can afford it. It should be there for everyone if they desire, and if they are academically qualified. to ensure everyone who wants to go to college is academically qualified, the education system needs a lot of work.

Being a student of history, particularly of the west, but increasingly of eastern cultures, I have to say,  human beings suck as a whole.  But we improve over time for the most part, albeit with many lapses in between.   

When I hear experiences such as yours, horrible as it may seem, I don't see it any worse than what minorities of other countries have had to experience.  And in fact, the ""violence"" in Korea, when compared to a country such as the US, is orders of magnitude less because of the ban on handguns to the average citizen."

Simply put your looking at some of the longest preserved or biggest empires in human history being wiped clean.

Britain especially was hit hard as rebuilding Britain meant shrinking the empire from a quarter of the world and billions of people to a small island and 60 million people.

The other factor to consider is that when a nation is on the bad end of a war the currency is worth less and sometimes nothing. I mean if your in the middle of a world war and your hungry and can't get food how much would you be willing to give for that food?

It's a cruel concept but every war this happens, somebody will exploit the situation. A lot of people didn't accept currency so you had to barter with hard goods. People were holding onto food very tightly so those with food had the upper hand and could demand anything they wanted.

In London people would put signs on cars advertising they were willing to give their car up for a good supply of food.

Since the currency was at such a low point as soon as the war was over the currency went through the roof.


I'm not sure how somebody would replicate that without being on the bad end of a war and of course that isn't an option.

&gt; If you think a free market system wouldn't deny anybody's individual rights and liberties

Do you even know what a free market is? In a free market, there are no corporations. The government has no legitimate power to create corporations through the process of incorporation, nor does it have the legitimate power to allow them to continue to exist by recognizing them in its courts and offices.

If we had a truly free market, the largest businesses would be quite tiny in comparison to those we see today. They'd have a few dozen employees. Unincorporated partnerships and the like. They'd have absolutely no limits to their liability, just as you as a private person have none.

Fuck, I'm not a republican. Not even close. I'm not some neocon yammering for a captive market that corporations can rape. Is that what you think a free market is? You're a fool.

&gt; Not to mention that the idea that the individual freedoms in a society are afforded only by a system of market liberalization is just absurd.

Market reform isn't even in my top 10 list of priorities. Suggesting that it is actually is a strawman fallacy.

I support almost unlimited freedom, socially.  If you are not inflicting or contributing to the noticeable physical or psychological suffering of someone or an animal, have at it.

I would almost encourage ""robbing from the rich"" (tax, etc) to give to these individuals, as the rich can endure it with little is any physical or psychological suffering.  Certainly I don't mind them being rich, but when someone has 7 houses because their family is rich, and another is homeless because they grew up poor and put more emphasis on working then schooling in order to help pay their parent's rent and were left with no desirable skills in an economic downturn...I think a little balancing is in order.

Ireland and UK have an immigration/customs agreement which is separate from the Schengen agreement governing travel in much of mainland Europe.

There is no such thing as ""EU customs"". And the reason the flight from Ireland to UK will not involve passport control has nothing to do with the EU. The UK/Ireland situation predates Schengen by many years.

When she travels from the UK to mainland Europe, she will have to go through passport control and get a new stamp.

An American gets 180 days to stay in the UK and Ireland. These days don't count against the 90 days she'll get in the Schengen area. She could, for example, spend 180 days in the UK, then spend 90 days in France/Spain/Italy/whatever, then spend another 180 days in the UK.

My paternal grandmother was the daughter of Jewish shopkeepers in Berlin, but also with a more Eastern background, don't know too much about her though, since she died when I was very young.

So what do I think about it? Those are all areas that were at least partially/often predominantly a German speaking population for hundreds of years, in some cases over 1000 years. But those areas also always had an ethnically quite diverse setup that kinda lived side by side pretty successfully. The kings that ruled often had little in common with the culture of the population anyway.  Germans speakers ruled for a time, Polish speakers ruled for a time, Swedes and Russians ruled for a time. And even such a German posterboy as Frederick the Great used French as his primary language.

Not true, all you have to do is look at all the major Islamic scientists of that era and you'll discover that they were also Islamic scholars. A good brief history on this subject could be found in Karen Armstrong's book, A Brief History of Islam.

One of the main reasons why the study of the sciences stopped could be traced to two major events. The Mongol invasion of Muslim lands (this includes the sacking of Baghdad as you mentioned) and the attack on Granada and the eventual conquest of Spain by the Spaniards from the Muslim. Seeing that Muslim texts were seen as herectical, major libraries were burned and scholars were killed.

This eventually lead to the reevaluation of Islamic governance in most Muslim countries, switching from an agrarian society to an Imperial one, such as that under the Ottoman, Safavid, and the Mughal Empires. These Empires spent most of their time investing money in military might, developing arms, and shaping their empires after the Mongols (the Safavids are distant relatives of the Mongols and the Mughals claimed to be descendants of the Mongol hordes). The main objective of these empires was not making sceintific discoveries, but rather military enhancements.

Patronage for the sciences stopped, and eventually Europe began where the Muslims left off. The Ottomans were never able to recover from this militrization. In fact, while Europe was advanding in the sciences, the Ottomans felt it was time to reform along European standards and instead of adopting the sciences, they adopted European military institutions, structuring their armies according to European standards. Also, whether we like to admit it or not, but military defeats against the Europeans lead to imperialism which really dampened any progress in the Muslim world. The Europeans delibirately kept the spread of Islamic isntitutions of knowledge under caps(which is actually one of the reasons why so many Muslims are ignorant about their own faith today since they have outdated institutions). There were several universities throughout the Muslim world before the arrival of Europeans, but that changed significantly after the Europeans shut them down effectively, which is why you have so many ""new"" institutions that started opening up around the mid 1800s when some restrictions were lifted.

This idea that Islamic scholars considering that the sciences was demonic is ridiculous and has no historical claim. Examples of Muslim scientists who were also Islamic scholars:

It doesn't have to be De Cecco, but to me, they're a good compromise -- really quite good, but not *too* pricy. While often very good, some of the artisan pasta are ridiculously expensive.

If I just use some sauce out of the glass, I don't care because it drowns anything anyway. But when I make aglio et olio, or have some nice pesto, then it does make a difference, IMHO.

You can probably get De Cecco online, but unless you're ready to keep a stockpile at home, you're probably better off finding a brand that is more easily available to you. Go to a deli, spend some ridiculous amount on high-end pasta, and see if it makes a difference for you. If it does, put some effort into finding a brand that you like, but that is still reasonably priced. All I'm saying is that yes, good pasta makes a difference, and it can be worth spending a little bit extra on it if your dish features the pasta prominently."

It seems Neil Tyson was putting the blame on one man, which in my opinion is ridiculously stupid. A man in 1060 was able to control the fate of Islam for generations? Forget the logistics of this guys words spreading around the Muslim world which was diverse as it was and ruled by many different factions. History is never as black and white and Neil Tyson, though a brilliant physicist, is a poor historian. History is an occurrence of a series of events, not a decree of one man. He also blames the decline of Islamic dominance of the sciences on Islamic scholars, which is as ridiculous as it gets.

All you have to do is look at all the major Islamic scientists of that era and you'll discover that they were also Islamic scholars. A good brief history on this subject could be found in Karen Armstrong's book, A Brief History of Islam.

One of the main reasons why the study of the sciences stopped could be traced to two major events. The Mongol invasion of Muslim lands (this includes the sacking of Baghdad as you mentioned) and the attack on Granada and the eventual conquest of Spain by the Spaniards from the Muslim. Seeing that Muslim texts were seen as herectical, major libraries were burned and scholars were killed.

This eventually lead to the reevaluation of Islamic governance in most Muslim countries, switching from an agrarian society to an Imperial one, such as that under the Ottoman, Safavid, and the Mughal Empires. These Empires spent most of their time investing money in military might, developing arms, and shaping their empires after the Mongols (the Safavids are distant relatives of the Mongols and the Mughals claimed to be descendants of the Mongol hordes). The main objective of these empires was not making sceintific discoveries, but rather military enhancements.

Patronage for the sciences stopped, and eventually Europe began where the Muslims left off. The Ottomans were never able to recover from this militrization. In fact, while Europe was advanding in the sciences, the Ottomans felt it was time to reform along European standards and instead of adopting the sciences, they adopted European military institutions, structuring their armies according to European standards. Also, whether we like to admit it or not, but military defeats against the Europeans lead to imperialism which really dampened any progress in the Muslim world. The Europeans delibirately kept the spread of Islamic isntitutions of knowledge under caps(which is actually one of the reasons why so many Muslims are ignorant about their own faith today since they have outdated institutions). There were several universities throughout the Muslim world before the arrival of Europeans, but that changed significantly after the Europeans shut them down effectively, which is why you have so many ""new"" institutions that started opening up around the mid 1800s when some restrictions were lifted.

This idea that Islamic scholars considering that the sciences was demonic is ridiculous and has no historical claim. Examples of Muslim scientists who were also Islamic scholars:

Maybe in the EU, the countries have agreements where criminals are sent back to their country of citizenship when crimes are committed in the EU, but that's not how it works in general.


In general, you are tried for the crime in the country you committed it.

It makes no sense otherwise....

You either committed a crime against a citizen of that country or against the country itself (for certain crimes the state is considered the ""victim"").

Why would they let you go?

More importantly, this is what actually HAPPENS. All you have to do is go look at examples of citizens committing crimes in other countries and you'll see what actually occurs is they are tried and spend their term there.

It takes very little research to find tons of examples of criminals committing crimes in other countries and being tried there.
I can think of scores off the top of my head.


There are exceptions to this, mainly:

Commit a crime in country A and flee to country B. Then country B will extradite you you back to A (usually).

Commit a crime that is not illegal in country A, but you are a citizen of country B where it is illegal.

In that case, many countries will charge you in your country of citizenship if the crime was against it's laws, despite being committed in another country."

Dear Sir/Madam,

I have been an avid Starcraft 2 fan for quite some time, and was looking forward to the first major North American tournament in 2011.  I have paid for every GSL tournament, and have kept up with all of the European and other North American tournaments, and was looking forward to seeing a high quality public event from Dallas.  I did not purchase the HQ stream ahead of time, because I thought it would be better to hear how good the quality was beforehand.  After seeing what has happened at Dallas, I am very happy I did not purchase the HD stream.

Having such widespread and extreme problems is simply unacceptable for such a major e-sports event.  I have read your post stating, ""More than twice the number of people we expected, from 128 countries, have tuned in to watch the Dallas event.""  When I read this, I am not thinking that e-sports is growing quickly.  Rather, I am thinking whoever estimated how many viewers you would have simply did not know anything about how large the community has become.  Other major events have had some difficulties, but nothing on the scale of the problems occuring at MLG Dallas.  After seeing the TSL3 have 50,000 concurrent viewers recently, there is really no excuse for a major organization such as the MLG for completely failing to offer a decent service.  Of course some of the other events are much more simple, but they also do not have the same sort of resources available to the MLG, and that makes the failure of MLG Dallas to live up to even basic standards that much more disappointing.

I then saw that you are going to give everyone who purchased an HQ pass a second free pass to the Colombus event.  This is not the best compensation for the problems you have had.  It would be much better to simply give everyone a full refund, and then let whoever purchased the pass decide whether or not to purchase the Colombus event.  If that event goes well, some of them may come back and again pay for the HQ stream in Colombus, but it should be the customer's decision instead of yours.

There are other things that need to be fixed beyond the stream itself.  The players having lag while playing their games, the complaints about being unable to hear the announcers, and the players actually being able to hear the announcers and the crowd all need to be fixed before MLG can hold any sort of decent Starcraft 2 event.

Beyond all that, I am very disappointed and upset with how MLG has hurt the e-sports scene.  MLG should be a leader in North America, making sure to put on high quality events and setting an example for tournaments everywhere.  The e-sports scene is still growing, and still struggling for acceptance in all areas.  Instead, your event in Dallas will only hurt the scene, and e-sports in general.  I have heard many stories about people getting their friends to finally watch an e-sports event, and their friends then asking, ""You pay $10 to watch a black screen?"" after the first night of MLG Dallas.  You had a chance to gain many new fans, not just for MLG but for e-sports in general, but instead you drove those people away.

I will continue to pay for GSL tournaments, and watch other events such as the TSL3.  I am also looking forward to the NASL, and will definitely be supporting them.  I just wish that I could support MLG as well, but supporting such poor events would actually hurt e-sports in general.  Maybe someday I will purchase a stream from an MLG event.  Rest assured, it will not be until MLG puts in several flawless events in a row.

I hope that the other events will be able to make up for the mistakes and issues your event has caused.

Googling... seems the message boarders over at snopes found that an author documenting Jesuit practices in Venezuela (early 1800s) may have classified the capybara as a fish.  But probably not any pope. [link](http://message.snopes.com/showthread.php?t=44035)

[This](http://www.nysun.com/foreign/in-days-before-easter-venezuelans-tuck-into/11063/) article suggests that the Vatican may have allowed it by request from European missionaries who were proselytizing poor people who needed to have something to eat during Lent, and argued that an organism with webbed feet that spent a lot of the time in the water should have special dispensation.  It seems actual origination of this dispensation is uncertain, but the practice certainly is real.

&gt;The Dutch grew tall (and continue to) because of good food and lactose tolerance which allowed them to consume a lot of milk. Those tall traits are passed on to their children - regardless of what the children are fed. Yes?

Lactose tolerance is a genetic adaptation, but not one that spread rapidly over the last 100 years, and isn't responsible for the sudden increase in height from say medieval Europe to today. 

Otherwise to your point, no. Eating nutritious food and growing tall does not allow you to pass on your height to your children.

What you are describing sounds an awful lot like [Lamarckism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism). The idea that environmental changes to the body are inherently passed onto offspring. Of course over time biology does adapt to the environment, but as Darwin pointed out, only when a change gives an evolutionary advantage to reproduction can it happen. 

&gt;So now you've switched your argument from ""evolution by natural selection is not happening"" to ""it's happening very slowly"".

I'd say my large parting from the left is when it comes to the foreign policy of America, and the overall attitude about the West that mostly emanates from its left-leaning residents (basically the self-hating leftist nonsense that can be found saturating Reddit or anywhere with enough clueless 20-somethings who just finished reading Zinn/Chomsky). As a brown guy myself who was raised in a fucked up Sikh/Muslim blended culture, it's been a helluva time watching reactions that white liberals provide when I state my disdain for religion and that yes, it is Islam itself, the belief and practice of it, that is the platform for shit like the recent UN member deaths.

You can see them racing, searching, sweating to find some way to pin it on their own government or culture. Kind of funny if it wasn't so sad.
 
I've spent decades moving between Canada and several countries in Europe and the Middle East, and a lot of time and money working with secular human rights groups (Oxfam and Doctors without Borders mainly). The notions that the (particularly young, again speaking from experience debating with foreigners and homeslices) liberals here have about victimization and foreign pillaging abroad are so far off the mark it's embarassing at best and perpetually self-defeating at worst. 
 
A good example of this is Nikolas Kristoff (mostly writes with NY Times), who along with his wife I adore tremendously for their often daring and always courageous work, I have experienced some of these terrible places myself and he is one brave mofo with an enormous heart. However, he has an allergic reaction to allowing the idea that religious beliefs have real consequences to arrive in the viable folder in his otherwise very sharp noggin, always relegating responsibility to lack of education, poverty; the always-reliable socio-economic bracket.

Your idea that there is a conspiracy theory is along the lines of the government supporting and perhaps actively developing lethal viruses or bacterial infections to keep people sick and taking medication. Some people believe that but it just doesn't really make any sense.

P.S. There are only handful of reputable antivirus companies and ad-ware companies.  E.g. Norton, McAfee, AVG, Avast, Panda, etc. A few of these have FREE versions for single license users, thus eliminating incentives to create more viruses. Think of it this way, if you're going to invest time and effort to make something and some other company is just going to try to fix it, do you have any incentive to actually go through with it?

So don't waste time and money looking for something before your trip.

Secondly, Chinese outlets are kind of a mess. Here's some typical situations: http://i.imgur.com/2TSAo.jpg

The ones with the big holes will accept two-prong US plugs (mostly, sometimes they won't take polarized plugs where one blade is larger than the other). The ones with the three big holes (upper middle and right), which are rare, will safely take three-prong grounded US plugs. I say safely, but there's always a possibility the ground isn't connected, in which case you may eventually damage your equipment. The only way to know for sure is with a tester, or to ask the electrician who wired it.

The ones with the three narrow pins at different angles (upper left) are the most common. For these you'll need an adapter which will cost a few cents anywhere in China. Make sure to get an adapter which accepts three-pin US plugs and not just two-pin plugs, and which has all three flat pins to go into the Chinese socket. Assuming the socket is wired correctly, these are safe for you and your gear.

**Never ever ever buy any adapter with moving or removable parts. This rules out most of the types that claim to be ""universal"". They are dangerous, both to you and to your equipment.** They're often sold in travel shops in American and European airports at crazy high prices. Just walk away.

As for your AA battery charger, if it only takes 120V (are you sure? I've never seen one like that, at least in recent years) then don't bring it, just bring the batteries. You can buy chargers in China for very cheap. If your razor requires 120V then leave it at home too."

Believe it or not, not everybody in India or China is that poor. I mean if 20% of the people in China make say $20 thousand dollars a year in percentage terms it might not seem like a lot but 20% of 1.4 billion is 280 million people.

India and China are just a numbers game but the US is genuinely consumerism on steroids. Europe doesn't even remotely measure upto the US when it comes to consumerism.

In Europe for example due to the fact that reading is a popular pass time not many people own huge flatscreen TV's. In fact in Britain a large percentage of the population has no TV.

Furthermore Americans also spend a lot on various things like second cars or big cars with lower fuel economy. In Europe a lot of people still bike and there are bike lanes everywhere. Public transport is common and a new network is being built as well.

Americans probably spend more per person than anybody on the planet to be frank which obviously benefits the government who get to tax everybody.

You won't be hearing about flatscreen TV's flying off the shelves in China anytime soon, those people are complete and utter bookworks from my experience.

Even as India and China get richer with lower living costs(and therefore lower taxes) the average Indian and Chinese man will be spending significantly smaller amounts per year and therefore paying less tax.

On the other hand when India and China eventually reach a similar GDP their population will give them quite an advantage. Anyway sorry for the rant."

I'm saying that I don't believe genetic adaptation is responsible for an increase in height Holland in the last 100 years. I think increased access to nutrition is responsible for that. Increased access to nutrition does not lead to passing on taller genes to your children, it simply allows a species capable of taller heights to reach that capability. 

There hasn't been anything in any of your links to disprove that. If anything they have shown just the [opposite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_height#Determinants_of_growth_and_height): 

&gt;Attributed as a significant reason for the trend of increasing height in parts of Europe are the egalitarian populations where proper medical care and adequate nutrition are relatively equally distributed. Changes in diet (nutrition) and a general rise in quality of health care and standard of living are the cited factors in the Asian populations. Average height in the United States has remained essentially stagnant since the 1950s even as the racial and ethnic background of residents has shifted. Severe malnutrition is known to cause stunted growth in North Korean, portions of African, certain historical European, and other populations.

""Tall people have tall children"" is a tautology. That doesn't say that height increasing in a 100 year timespan is a result of genetic selection. Although you haven't outright stated it, I think we can accept as a fact that access to nutrition does not alter your DNA in a way that makes your children even taller then you were. "

The mall your talking about was empty, you are correct. The problem is there were no western brands moving in but since the olympics that has all changed. Now they are building more super malls in the country.

Theres also the fact that they started building in places like Hong Kong when the place didn't have that high a population and it looked like they were wasting their time but you should see it now, it's like a sardine.

They did the same with Bejing when it was deserted. They basically built the infrastructure and then people took up occupation. Again Beijing wasn't that well populated but it is now.

Their current project is Shanghai. Their building enormous amounts in Shanghai but the population(apart from the center) is low but at the same time they are anticipating growth from 15 to 50 million in 25 years.

The truth is you have to build factories and buildings and all that other crap and then people will come.

I also find it interesting that you think Europe is fucked. Why would you say Europe is in any danger in your opinion? The current Euro problems won't go away but with more countries being bought into the fold and Eastern European economies growing the EU as an entity should experience growth.

Take for example Eastern Europe and their plane building facilities. Labour is cheaper there and it allows them to compete with a technology the Asians don't have at their disposal yet. My dad handles some of the Airbus contracts out there and he says Eastern Europe is seeing good investment."

Instead, they appear to have rushed into this operation without a workable Plan B. Their hope was that air strikes and the pressure of rebel advances would cause the regime to crumble. But Gaddafi's forces – still vastly more powerful than the rebels – have reversed their losses and a stalemate looks more likely. Further, even high-profile defections have not yet appeared to influence Gaddafi's (admittedly less than rational) thinking. Unless he is killed or otherwise overthrown, Gaddafi can continue to hold out, supported by a small number of loyalists and family members, in the hope that he can prolong the war to the point where the costs begin to exceed the potential benefits for US and its coalition partners. Given that he faces exile, indictment or death if he is overthrown, he has every incentive to do just that.

I think that Gaddafi has reacted brilliantly and rapidly to the NATO strategy of bombing his army into inaction. It only took the Libyan army a week to abandon their military bases, to abandon their armored vehicles, to abandon their uniforms and clearly to mostly abandon using military radios for communications. The Libyan Army is now indistinguishable from the rebels.

All of a sudden the utility of air power has been erased. Gaddafi has the upper hand. But will he chase the rebels all the way back to Benghazi or will he stop short of that and force a peace settlement?"

OK. The Bible doesn't come right out and say it but God's emissary on earth, the Pope, instructed us to do this.

In a fifteenth century papal bull Pope Nicolas V instructed European Christian nations to ""invade, capture, vanquish"" and ""subdue"" Indigenous Peoples, ""subjugate"" them and ""reduce their persons to perpetual slavery"" and ""to take away all their possessions and property."" And according to a United Nations World Conference Against Racism document, he also ""declared war against all non-Christians throughout the world"".

""In 1452, Nicholas V issued the papal bull Dum Diversas, granting the King of Portugal the right to reduce any ""Saracens, pagans and any other unbelievers"" to hereditary slavery. Dum Diversas legitimised the colonial slave trade that begun around this time with the expeditions by Henry the Navigator to find a sea route to India, which were financed with African slaves. This approval of slavery was reaffirmed and extended in his Romanus Pontifex of 1455.

It is argued that collectively the two bulls issued by Nicholas gave the Portuguese the rights to acquire slaves along the African coast by force or trade. The concessions given in them were confirmed by bulls issued by Pope Calixtus III ""Inter Caetera quae"" (1456), Sixtus IV ""Aeterni regis"" (1481) and Leo X (1514) and they became the models for subsequent bulls issued by Pope Alexander VI : ""Eximiae devotionis"" (May 3, 1493), ""Inter Caetera"" (May 4, 1493) and ""Dudum Siquidem (September 23, 1493) when he conferred similar rights to Spain relating to the newly discovered lands in the Americas.[7]""

&gt;I wouldn't believe such a holy and compassionate being wouldnt advocate the killing of one another for material gain...

Come on. This is the same god who blames every one of us for a single act of disobedience that occurred ten thousand years ago, drowned every infant and child on earth, tortured Job and killed his family in a wager with Satan and instructed his chosen people to wipe out every man, woman and child in Canaan and keep the tasty virgins for themselves.

The social responsibility of Christians is to spread Christianity. We have known this to be true since at least the days of Constantine.

Secondly, where did I talk about comparing ourselves to anyone? I simply said, there is no reason to change our culture or lifestyles to try and become something else. If the Chinese want to do that, then let them. 

This is about what is actually going on. Sure the article talks about how the Chinese have topped the world in academic-style testing. It also fails to mention the variety of negative attributes China carries, including the methodology of its schooling.

China, like the former Soviet Union, imposes math and science on its children as much as they elect to study it. Whether or not this is good, can be debated, but the lack of choices available in Chinese schools is far from the norm in Western culture. It's also interesting to note the lack of creativity provided or allowed in their public school systems. This translates into poor decision-making or problem-solving in the business arena. I was just in Beijing and was warned prior about this and it was astonishing how prevalent it is. I suspect this is the reason you see so much copyright infringement and IP theft. 

As for the recent studies, they only visited the best parts of Shanghai, the most Westernized city in China (sans Hong Kong). When you take the entire education system as a whole, it has just as many holes and flaws as that in the US. This is why you see all of the Ex-Pats from the US, Europe, Australia, etc. send their children to private, ""Western"" schools instead of Chinese public institutions. 

Alas, what ""lunch"" exactly have the Chinese come for? The unskilled labor's ""lunch"", maybe? As the Yuan continues to appreciate against the USD (which poses many cons for the US), I am interested to see how China will adapt and if it can become an innovative nation like South Korea.

Along with all of these various issues, if you venture around China, you quickly realize some of the crucial issues that will really set the country back someday. The most notable is the obvious demographic shift or shock that will occur due to the ""one child"" policy, which oh by the way, is still in place. Abortions of female fetuses is still very common, as is female adoptions (i.e. exportation of females to other nations that will likely stay in the countries they grow up). 

There is also the lack of freedom that the Chinese lack. I was unable to go on Facebook or Google products unless I used a specialized VPN routed through LA, which of course was shut down as well. Can you imagine? 

For all of the media hype, I have more faith in South Korea and India as two of the leading nations of the future. China is a bubble economy, fueled by a massive population. We shall see how sustainable this will be."

Very simply if the dollar isn't the reserve currency then the dollar will no longer be tied to gold or other currencies. The whole reason so many of these countries want to get rid of the US dollar is because their currencies will be safer tied to an SDR.

And your right about Europeans not being consumers like the US. Americans are the worlds biggest consumers by far while most Europeans are more minimalist but again it comes to scales of economy.

Europe is not a small place, it has an enormous population and one with pretty good wealth distribution. Also like I said the Eastern European economies are experiencing growth on a yearly business and getting investment.

You can complain about freedom of press, but putting in Cyprus and Armenian Genocide into your argument just shows your bias. Especially showing a newspaper article that is known for anti-Turkish government rants, isn't highly regarded.

 Maybe its not the place, but what American and European media are neglecting to tell you is what really happened in Cyprus and Turkey during early 1900's. This is why Ottoman records are open to all countries for fact checking and Armenian archives are closed to the public and even to their government officials. They are afraid that people are going to find out about the lies.


Cyprus: Lots of Muslim Turks living in Cyprus were being killed due to their religion. It wasn't even gang killings, but it war the governments soldiers torturing and killing anybody that wouldn't convert. (There are some newspapers from that time that even showed these contents). Since diplomacy couldn't stop this unspoken genocide, turkish government sent in troops to help protect its own civilians.


Armenia: During the early 1900's, the sick man of Europe was the Ottoman Empire. Imperialistic countries were invading to get land all the way from New Zealand, to Greece, to England, ... and Australia. During this period many Turkish and nonTurkish young, and old fought in many great Wars. Eventually, Turkish troops wons in a battle that many died. Their were cases where gangs killed Turks and gangs killed Armenians. Overall more percentage of Turks died in this period than the percentage of Armenians. Years later, countries that couldn't weaken the Turkish country started its propaganda articles and ""photoshopped"" magazine covers, to convince that genocide was occuring. Even to this day many argue of genocide, but Turkish parliament cannot convince Armenian government to open its archives to a third party group to analyze the reality of events, but just 1 year ago, the Armenian president refused.



(Message me if you need the sources. I can gladly show you the propaganda photoshops, % of dead bodies of both groups dug up, Armenian president's speech, newspaper articles from decades ago.)

So, a relatively respected international organization publishes a paper that is ""widely regarded as a whitewash,"" but the author can't find anyone credible to go on the record with a quote? He can't dig up any papers by credible scientists to support the ""widely regarded"" opinion?

The rest of the article is very similar. E.g.,

Of course Turkey will have to change its laws and policies according to [Acquis](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Community_acquis), but this would only strengthen Turkey's long term viability and potential contribution to the EU.

It would also allow the EU to have a border with the Middle East (Syria, Iraq, Iran) as well as a border with Central Asia (Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan).

You have not answered to that yet. Now you accuse me of dodging the point?

I thought it was implied in my example that gun control alone is not enough a variable to account for all the difference in behaviour. It appears to me that culture accounts for a larger part of the difference and yes, there are huge cultural and social differences between US and Europe.  I wasn't trying to dodge the question, I just assumed it was implied.

Look at what happens with gun violence when you have strict gun control in the US. Nothing! Violence stays high. So it seems that there is something else driving the violence up. Look at what happens in Europe when you have no gun control: the murder rates are similar to the countries that have the strictest laws.

And you don't need to mock Brazil, we *are* enough of a mockery of a country already. I have not the slightest doubt that we are indeed uncivilized. And I am inclined to think that any country with such high gun death rates is uncivilized also. If you look at gun deaths in Britain before the gun control became strict, they are nowhere near american rates.

But these are just assumptions, I have no idea what is the real source of gun violence in the U.S. But I am not the one claiming that I know it, you are. The burden of evidence is yours, not mine.

All pollutants linger in the environment for some amount of time. The carbon dioxide that we've emitted into the atmosphere will be will us for thousands of years, as well. We can continue to live with an increased atmospheric concentration of CO2, but if it gets high enough we just won't be able to breath anymore. (This is why mammals didn't evolve until after the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event-- the CO2 levels were much higher and mammalian lungs didn't work as efficiently).

Radiation has the advantage that it stays somewhat contained. There's still radiation at Chernobyl, but you hang out anywhere in Europe without worrying. It also has the advantage that there's much less of it per unit of energy produced, since a normally functioning nuclear power plant releases almost no radiation at all.

&gt; Coal is awful. Why bother to compare? We need to get rid of this sort of pollutant but how does that relate to nukoolar? EDIT: It sounds to me like saying being burgled is much better than being beaten half to death and left in a coma.

There are no realistic short-term (&lt;50 year) alternatives to having some coal or some nuclear. We could close all the coal plants in the USA if we replaced them with nuclear. And, this could be done in under 10 years. This would lead to a huge drop in atmospheric emissions at the cost of increased risk of some radiation. Since the radiation would still be less hazardous than continuing to belch smog into the air, I tend to favor this general idea.

Eventually, we may find that we can replace all our electrical generation with renewables. Or, that we could reduce consumption significantly. Or, something like that. But, this is not a very realistic short term (&lt;50 year) plan for the human race.

If you act holier than thou and quote D.A.R.E. at people, then you'll be seen as a major douche.

This can also impact some friendships if you befriend people who do enjoy drinking socially, they won't really know what to invite you to or how to act around you about alcohol, and depending on the drinking culture of your school this could be a pretty major thing.

My advice: try it before you knock it. If you don't have a legitimate medical or sociocultural reason for not drinking, try alcohol. If you can, get your hands on more expensive alcohol, so if you know someone who's over 21, or has a really good fake ID and is willing to buy, pay em for something good. It takes dedication to get over the taste of low end alcohol, and if you don't plan on drinking a lot, invest in decent liquor. Don't swear off all alcohol because you tried keystone and didn't like it (fun fact, the only people who enjoy keystone enjoy getting drunk off of it and not the actual taste). This is akin to saying no to all fruits because you didn't like an apple you once tasted, there are a lot of alcoholic beverages out there with a huge range of tastes and textures to them, so don't lump them all together as just alcohol. This will help you out in some social situations where drinking alcohol may be expected of you, and you'll at least know what you favor and what you'd rather avoid.

Heres a short list of things you should at least try before you totally swear off drinking:

* a mid range beer (your sam adams [try their boston lager for a straightforward beer taste, and not say a winter blend or whatever], goose island, bass, blue moon [which has a nice citrusy taste to it], guiness [really thick and heavy, has a strong taste to it, like drinking a cup of black coffee]) These'll run you about 7-10 dollars for a six pack, and that's more than enough for you to get an idea if you actually enjoy beer and if not you'll at least get brownie points for giving someone a five pack of good beer.

* A 10-15 dollar bottle of wine. In this range you get a perfectly fine bottle of wine, that while it won't impress a Sommelier, it will give you a good drink. DON'T forget, try both a red and a white wine. They are sufficiently different in taste that you may end up hating one and loving the other. I happen to find the tannins in red wines too overpowering, and make it taste far too bitter. Whereas I love a good Gewürztraminer or any other white wine.

* A good vodka. I think Absolut is overpriced, and if you can find it, get Nemiroff. Nemiroff is what eastern europeans really drink. It's very smooth, if you feel like you're drinking rubbing alcohol, you're drinking way too cheap a vodka. Here's a rule of thumb, if it comes in a plastic jug, then the manufacturers expect people to drink it just to get shitfaced, ergo they manufacture it in the adult version of the sippy cup. Infused vodkas are perfectly legit. I enjoy Honey Pepper Nemiroff, which has actual chili peppers in the bottle with a touch of honey; it has a bite to the taste and leaves you with a smokey-sweet aftertaste. 

* A cocktail. These are usually the most palatable, because they can use fruit juices or other infusions to mask the alcohol. Or it may use two competing elements to cancel each other out and leave you with a good tasting drink. Case in point: gin and tonics. Tonic water by itself tastes like poison to me and gin tastes like pine sol. A gin and tonic, on the other hand, tastes like carbonated lime soda and is incredibly refreshing.

* If all else fails, go with a Mike's hard lemonade or a wine cooler. Those have no alcoholic taste to them, and are like drinking juice. And their alcohol contents are low enough that you can safely experiment with how much it takes for you to start feeling the alcohol, to actually get drunk, etc, with no fear of going too far in the course of a bottle."

I suffered anti-Irish abuse while living in London and was seen as slightly above the ""Gastarbeiters"" in Berlin because I am white and Irish.

My point was that I had worked as an architect, and yes, I made a shite load of money in each of the three cities which were booming and then collapsed.

I don't feel that I was lecturing anybody, just throwing in my Tuppence Ha'penny as a forced emigrant from the bad old days. When I graduated in '94 I really wanted to stay in Ireland but after sending out 130 CVs I only got one interview for a three month contract. I didn't get the job and a few months later I landed a job doing a traffic survey in Dundrum for an engineering company. With the money I earned from that shitty job I emigrated to Berlin where I got a job as an architect within three weeks of arriving.

Again I will stress my point that the Celtic Tiger was unsustainable, people foolishly got swept up in it and are now paying the bitter bitter price.

Case in point: I was on the team for the Dundalk Xerox campus design. The brief the company I worked for was that each of the campus buildings could have a potential 100% expansion in square meters and also could have multi-use potential for future development. The only exception was the toner building which was a highly specialised construction. Xerox were coaxed to set up operations in Dundalk by the low corporate tax rates and the educated workforce. Xerox moved from the Netherlands to Dundalk, the Dutch were livid. For Dundalk it was a godsend, people thought they had jobs for life and mortgaged themselves heavily on the strength of that. Dormitory housing estates were built without the proper community infrastructure. Recipe for social disaster.

Where is Xerox now? Off in some Eastern European country after their brief low corporate tax sojourn in Ireland. Ireland got raped by the multinationals, who went there to earn a quick buck or not to pay as much corporate tax as elsewhere. Haughey set it up and fair play to his corrupt/criminal soul he brought Ireland into the modern business age."

Why I never once heard the name of a Muslim scientist or philosopher. I never heard of Indian or Chinese philosophy. In our history books, we had 6 chapters dedicated to Europe (all of which conveniently leave out the crimes of Imperialism), and dedicate half a chapter to Africa, 1 chapter to the Middle East, 1 chapter to South Asia, 1 chapter to East Asia, and the left overs to South America. 

Even when I got to college and I took my basic history classes, we spent hours talking about the atrocities committed by the Japanese during World War II, but never did we touch on [King Leopold II of Belgium is responsible for 2 to 15 million estimated killings in the Congo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_II_of_Belgium#Private_colonialism).

What sickens me about people like you and others who refuse to acknowledge this history, but expect Muslims to take responsibility for their crimes.

You dare to come and ask for an explanation from Muslims for the regrettable crimes against the UN workers, but give a passing glance to the crimes committed on a daily basis against Muslims? I wonder how long will the issue related to recent atrocities in Afghanistan by NATO forces will stay on the front page of the news?

How dare you call the deaths of innocent women, children, and elderly as ""collateral damage""? An attack on European civilians is known as terrorism, but an attack on non-European civilians is simply passed off as collateral damage?

Population density doesn't matter at those travel times. And you act as if there aren't cities in Europe more than 300 mi apart? LA to SF is about the same distance as Copenhagen to Stockholm, I took that train actually and the Swedish X2 trains are much slower than the proposed HSR trains for CA. Or even Berlin, there are some nearby minor cities of course like Hannover and one big one in Hamburg but it's probably about the same distance to Amsterdam, Cologne, Frankfurt, Munich, or Copenhagen. And towns like Bakersfield and Fresno are getting quite populated now as well. And sure European cities are generally closer, but doesn't mean you don't run into people who are traveling large distances using rail regularly.

As for price, Europe has a rail pass that's extremely cost efficient if you use the rail a lot (great for when backpacking), and there are a significant number of frequent commuters between SF and LA that I'm sure would prefer that. Or people who would become frequent commuters should such a thing become available.

Plus trains are so much more comfortable and painless than flying. Less (to almost no) security delays, easy to get a ticket, have your luggage on you at all times (sometimes a pain to carry but nice to not have to worry about getting lost or damaged), more leg room, can chill in the dining car, if you miss your train usually not a big deal to just catch the next one, etc.

The unfortunate fact of the matter is that a lot of people are happy with the 2 party system... and most importantly, the only people who can actually change it... the elected officials, will *never* do it, as it would surely put them out of a job.

The only way to get things done is to change one of the parties in power. Right now the easiest party to change would be the dems, because they get it about 75% right.

Anyways.  I better reason not to is because the most sensitive part on his body, where the frenulum attaches the rigid band and foreskin to the glans, will be severed and form scar tissue.  Go and watch some POV porn or fap it and look on the bottom of your cock head.  If you are cut you will see a tiny or large scar depending on the type of device used.  This is basically the male clit or gspot.  

The way I look at it is to realize that the frenulum is one of the richest bundles of nerves on the penis.  Just like the cilt is on women.  While the rigid band, a separate part of the foreskin with more nerves than the rest of the skin, is more like the clitoral hood and the foreskin is more like the labia.  I know it is difficult for many people to understand because medical books are woefully lacking in this area and many want to compare to glans or cock head to the clit but this is a false analogy if you look at the number of nerve ending in both.

The glans has about half the number of nerve endings as the clit does but you need to realize that the bundle of nerves in the clit actually extends inside the vagina.  Next time you are with your girl, take your fingers, index and middle, with your palm up and her on her back, and insert them and do a come hither motion and press against the upper inside part of her vagina behind the clit.  It will feel different than the rest of the inside of her, and it varies between women, but this clump of nerves connects to the clit and is called the gspot.  

I did a lot of personal and academic research into this and I also have the benefit of having a father who used to work as a gynocologist and I learned to draw from reading medical books as a kid...he isn't a doctor any more because he got sued by some white trash but that is a different story.  

Have you ever seen the feminist pro sex arguments that goes like this:

1. Women have x amount of nerves in their clit.

2. Men have y number of nerves in the glans/cock head.

3. x is greater than y by 50%

4.  Haha, women can have multiple orgasms and men can't...lulz, women are better than men.

This is not the full picture but I have seen it on Oprahs website and even in classes.  If you take the number of nerve endings in the foresking + number in frenulum + number in rigid band + number in glans it = the number in clit +clit hood+gspot + labia....with shaft = to the internal walls of the vagiiiiiina.

I will admit that I am uncut and I have hiked the Sinai mountains more than once and not showered for weeks and this was before I could drive cause I lived with my single mom overseas in Egypt as a teen....I never had any problems.  I do remember readin more than one survival story where a group of guys were out in the arctic and got severe frost bite on their toes and fingers and even their dick...they all had to have parts amputated except one guy didn't get it on the dick...he was uncut.  It serves more purposes than to gross out females.  

Unfortunately it is ultimately your choice but if you are going to make it then please do some research and make sure it is fully informed.  

I will say this.  As a uncut guy I can have multiple orgasms.  Orgasm != ejaculation.  They are actually two different processes in the body.  I have seen one or two studies and plenty of anecdotal evidence that uncut guys have higher sex drives.  This may not, to be truthful, have anything to do with having foreskin but may have more to do with having to get over more hang ups sexually when we come of age...girls like confidence.  Then again, haven't you ever wondered why American women are so obsessed with european men?  I remember the last time I was in Israel I was hitting on some bitches and they kept asking about whether or not I was cut and whether I would get cut.  Apparently a lot of Israeli women, especially in the more liberal Tel Aviv, want to know what the other side feels like before getting arranged marriages or settling down with a nice traditional Jewish man....this is one problem in the area, because many go after palestinian men for sexual experiences and ofcourse this creates male-male competition and jealousy which exacerbates the political tensions....and..have a upboat."

That's been debunked. It's the outdated views of European Orientalism. The philosopher from Al-Andalus, Ibn Rushd, tried to refute Al-Ghazali's Skepticism by dismissing it all as ""sophistry"" in his ""Incoherence of the Incoherence"" and that's the book the Europeans first received. Ibn Rushd made some hysterical claims because here was a guy who still believed the world was eternally old and his entire outdated mode of thought based on Greek rationalism was completely refuted. Anyway, many of the works of Ibn Rushd that made it into Europe were further corrupted. It wasn't long before Al-Ghazali's (Algazel or Alghazel, whatever they called him in Europe) work made it into Europe and it had a profound affect on the philosophers who would later be instrumental in the rise of modern Western philosophy (Malebranche, Berkeley, Hume, all of whom who espoused similar philosophies, with Hume being the notable atheist and the other two being occasionalists in line with Islamic theology).

Al-Ghazali wasn't anti-science at all, he spoke quite in favor of it. He was pro-Empiricism. He was just also a Skeptic, not unlike David Hume who did essentially the same things in the West. Al-Ghazali was just anti-Greek-Rationalism because it had become outdated and couldn't address the glaring problems of induction and causation. 

The reason he went after the Peripatetic school of philosophers was because they had deviated from the orthodoxy on points of theology (like about the nature of the Qur'an, God, whether the world was eternal or created, etc). None of these had to do with science.

Al-Ghazali was basically representing the Ash'ari theological school and many scientists from it contribute a great deal. Even the scientific method itself was first codified by Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) who followed the Ash'ari creed like Al-Ghazali. Ibn al-Nafis (author of the first sci-fi novel, and who discovered a great deal about the nature of pulmonary circulation), Ibn Khaldun (one of history's greatest polymaths who had a LaMarckist theory of evolution, pioneered sociology, and so on), etc

Not all Muslim scientists were even philosophers. That was the problem with Greek rationalism, the people who engaged in it spent all their time philosophizing and not enough time ""doing science"". They were actually regressing the development of science."

It is hard to say that they are obsolete.  Close air support is the best thing the US military has going for it.  Being able to project that to areas where there are no bases is extremely valuable.

&gt;What use is a million man army if 98% of them are cannon fodder?

The soviets were well trained when they went against the afghani's and that didn't mean much.  Training isn't everything.  The europeans wouldn't be able to give the close air support necessary.

&gt;Also Canada and Europe are far more technologically advanced than North Korea or China.

Agreed, however they just don't have that many planes, missiles, ships, etc.

Why does this matter?  Nuclear subs accomplish the same thing.

What does matter is how the EU see it, politically and academically, and they see it as genocide denial. To add, this is not just a matter of genocide denial. It is also a freedom of speech issue with Turkey, as such speech can be illegal and punished (see article 301 amongst others). These kind of laws would not be compatible with the EU as they would be a violation of human rights. I am not sure how Turkey, or at least the hardcore nationalists, would deal with such open speech if it were to join the EU. Not another assassination, per Hrant Dink, I hope.

As for international media neglecting to tell us the ""truth"" let us also be careful about our own. Regarding access to archives:

&gt;Turkish professor Halil Berktay, of Sabanci University, said: ""Those controlling the archives approach access on the basis of extremely short-sighted national interest - what is good for Turkey. They give access to those people who they see as being friends of Turkey and refuse those who they see as hostile. We know that some archives relating to the period are completely sealed off."" [source](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=159455&amp;sectioncode=26)

That said normalisation of relationships with Armenia, is I believe really the bigger issue here. Both in terms of EU (whether or not ascension ever happens), Turkey itself and not to mention Armenia. 

As for EU accepting only Christian nations there are plenty of other reasons for a Turkish ascension to the EU failing. Issues that would make for a better stronger Turkey if rectified. Freedom of speech, expression and assembly, allowing conscientious objectors, improving women's rights and resolving the poor treatment of minorities particular Kurds.

The word 'conspiracy' has this discourse nowadays which implies that the conspiracy is not true; Fritz Fischer's    account of *Germany's aims in the First World War* is factual.

 &gt;Griff nach der Weltmacht: Die Kriegzielpolitik des kaiserlichen Deutschland 1914–1918 (published in English as Germany's Aims in the First World War), in which he argued that Germany had deliberately instigated the First World War in an attempt to become a world power.[1] In this book, which was primarily concerned with the role played in the formation of German foreign policy by domestic pressure groups, Fischer argued that various pressure groups within German society had ambitions for aggressive imperialist policy in Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East.[1] In Fischer's opinion, the ""September Program"" of September 1914 calling for the annexation of most of Europe and Africa was an attempt at compromise between the various demands of the lobbying groups within German society for wide-ranging territorial expansion.[1] Fischer argued that the German government deliberately and consciously used the crisis occasioned by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in the summer of 1914 to execute already preformulated plans for a war against France and Russia in order to create Mitteleuropa, a German-dominated Europe and Mittelafrika, a German-dominated Africa.[8] Though Fischer argued that the German government did not want a war with Britain at that moment, they were fully prepared to run the risk in pursuit of Mitteleuropa and Mittelafrika.[8]

&gt;The book was preceded by Fischer's groundbreaking 1959 article in the Historische Zeitschrift in which he first published the arguments that he expanded upon in his 1961 book. In The Shield of Achilles: War, Peace, and the Course of History, Philip Bobbitt has written that after Fischer published it became, ""impossible to maintain"" that World War I had been some sort of ""ghastly mistake"" rather than a deliberate and intentional German policy.[9]

&gt;For most Germans, it was acceptable to believe that Germany had caused World War Two, but not World War One, which was still widely regarded as a war forced upon Germany by its encircling enemies. Fischer was the first German historian to publish documents showing that the German chancellor Dr. Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg had developed plans in 1914 to annex all of Belgium, part of France and part of European Russia.[1] Fischer suggested that there was continuity in German foreign policy from 1900 to the Second World War, implying that Germany was responsible for both world wars. 


* NATO gave the Serbs a knowingly unacceptable ultimatum prior to the '99 Kosovo intervention. A little ironic considering Austria's 1914 calculatedly unacceptable ultimatum to the Serbs. [Check it out for yourselves](http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/ramb.htm) with special attention to Appendix B--which was added only the day before and was not included in the copy given to Russia, the Serb ally at the Rambouillet conference. Chapter 4a is also rather interesting.

FTFY

Berlin was/is cheap because the housing prices where low. Therefor people can cope with less money - and also the income is lower compared to other cities. But that will probably end in the foreseeable future

There are a lot of foreign investors who think it is a good idea to drive al the housing prices up and then some more in order for them to become multi-multi-multi millionaires. All free space is used to build new houses, all old houses are renovated, people with old contracts move out - sometimes forced to move out - and the new tenants have to pay far, far more for the same apartment or the apartment is sold for absurd prices.

The idea behind this is that in the end the housing prices will be as high as in london or munich - in their eyes this is a normal development for a capital of a country and they just don't care about the people living in that city. 

In short they are creating a bubble and the people living here will be the victims of this (and sometimes already are).

Furthermore, as stated in the other comments, there are thought to be significant oil reserves there.  The problem is, a lot of the Arctic ocean would be akin to international waters.  Nobody thought to hard about it when it was ice and an unforgiving climate, but now countries like Canada, the US, Russia, Norway and Denmark are all pitching to an international body their evidence that the continental shelf extending out from their shores is geologically continuous with the Arctic sea bed, giving them a stronger claim to any drilling that may go on there.  But, because international bodies' power is largely moral authority, a big decider of it will be exercising sovereignty there.  Various countries have done this, in Canada's case by sending more summer naval voyages through and the Canadian Forces conducting more exercises with the Arctic Rangers, a joint unit with the Inuit.  For example, they landed on [Hans Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Island#2004_to_present) in 2005.       "

Furthermore the talk here of the ticket not being paid is also incorrect - the ticket was most definitely written and the ticket will be sent to the rental company who, in turn, will assign the cost of the ticket to the lessee of the vehicle. The rental company will pay the cost no matter what – it’s up to the company to recoup the money from the lessee. If it's bad enough they'll try to sue them across countries, but that's up to the rental company. If the company chooses not to sue across countries they could easily domesticate a suit against the lessee if they ever return to the US and were able to serve the lessee.

And the officer could have very easily arrested them. When the Gumball 3000 went through the US there were any number of Europeans who were flagrantly disregarding the speed limits - and a good number of them were ticketed or even arrested. Several state highway patrols managed to interdict over a dozen cars at once traveling in packs, some of the drivers of which were previously ticketed by the exact same officers, which meant this time they went to jail.

The police treated the Gumball 3000 so badly that they organizers said they were never coming back to America - drivers started getting targeted, pulled over, and arrested just for having the stickers on their cars. They'd claim to smell marijuana just so they could hold them on the side of the road for a drug dog to show up - they never found drugs - the whole point was to just stop the cars so the drivers wouldn't get good times.

This isn't just a problem with the Gumball 3000 either - because most people know they just ignored speed limits. There are numerous car clubs that do distance runs, poker runs, efficiency runs, or any other number of motor vehicle long-distance events that get harassed by state and local police officers wanting to wave the law around mostly just to get their rocks off. It's not what the uniform is supposed to represent. It breeds disrespect for what the law is, it puts future officers and the public in jeopardy as people weigh whether or not it’s just advisable to try to outrun the police to avoid suffering from their harassment, and in general undermines the idea of being a peace officer. The police exist to keep the peace not to breed conditions for the breach of the peace.

TL;DR - This officer had no right to act this way - he was out of line and should be at minimum subject to official reprimand for conduct unbecoming. This man is a sworn peace officer levying threats of felony assault and rape against this driver. The severity of this driver's infraction is immaterial to the officer's conduct, even though the driver's actions did constitute a misdemeanor that in no way justifies the officer’s criminal threats. This sort of conduct breeds distrust of the uniform, endangering the public therein, and generally works to discredit the honesty and justice the uniform is supposed to represent. He should be at minimum administered an official reprimand with forfeiture of time off - he should at most be facing a period no less than two weeks of administrative unpaid leave.

There was a time back in the 1700s where the word ""Orient"" referred to basically everything west of Hungary (except Russia). Then, as the countries of Eastern Europe became stronger and well know, the ""Orient"" reeceded to include China and ALL of south Asia, both east and west. 

The ""orient"" further shrank with British imperialism's expansion into India. At this point, the term began to refer to what we now think of when it's used: China, Japan, some of the other ""Chinese-looking (SO POLITICALLY INCORRECT) populations such as Korea, Vietnam, and the oft forgotten Laos. 

Anyway, throughout the whole time that the term was used, it was ALWAYS employed in a derogatory and offensive fashion. The Orient was some far off place with simple minded inhabitants that were historically seen to be child-like. 

So, I don't believe the term itself is derogatory, it's one of those terms that's been poisoned by history and now causes some discomfort when employed. Kinda like the swastika: once it was a symbol of power, then Hitler fucked it up for everyone.

Scarcity is one reason. Surely you can imagine why we don't use sandstone as currency? Hyper inflated prices abound.

Another reason is *because* precious metals have no practical value. Imagine if you had some mad origami skills and could fold your dollar into something that could net you 3 dollars worth of value. What use would your dollar have as a currency?

The other reason is durability. gold doesn't disintegrate in your pocket. You can store it.

I don't think it's any coincidence that precious metals (gold specifically) were valued in ancient civilizations from the americas, to europe, to asia, to africa. Although I will admit that in south america specifically, gold had less value because it was less scarce ;).

&gt;finding new veins of it would change it's value

This is absolutely right. And if you look at the CPI before the US switched off gold, you'll notice relative price instability, with periods of inflation and periods of deflation. However, just as a matter of personal opinion, I would rather have relatively unstable prices in the short term, and relatively stable prices in the long term. 

Paper money creates a state in which there is consistent inflation over time. This makes prices stable in the short term, but in the long term with NO periods of deflation, prices change DRASTICALLY over time.

I'm not necessarily saying one is necessarily better than the other, but that is why i think precious metals are naturally more valuable. "

I disagree. Some taxes always benefit the taxpayer. The taxes that pay for roads, police, firemen, an army capable of maintaing the borders of the nation (historically, anyways) are all things that benefit everybody. Welfare programs do not benefit the rich, but the rich pay for them.

&gt;you ultimately owe ALL of your wealth to whatever society you are a member of

I disagree with this as well. There are societies that make things significantly harder for certain groups to prosper - do these people owe everything they have to that society? Think of Jews in medieval Europe or blacks in the antebellum South. One could imagine a successful Medieval Jew or Southern Black who doesn't owe society anything and is in fact owed much by a society that has persecuted him. This is just an extreme example. I don't know why someone would owe things to society just because it's possible to prosper in that society.

&gt;My attitude is very different from yours. If I work 60+ hours a week and become a millionaire, I would be profoundly thankful for my good luck, and I would harbor no spite at all for the millions of Americans who work as hard or harder than me and yet remain below the poverty line.


I also harbor no spite for the poor. Yet I would not want to be forced to give my money away, for any reason aside from the afore mentioned roads, police, etc. Would I freely give to charity if I was in such a position? Of course, I don't know who wouldn't.

At some point it just comes down to the question, ""do you believe this specific subset of the population (in this case, the poor) deserves money more than the taxpayers?""

richest Americans let alone identify them visually in order to point them out to a lynch mob?  
2.

If you want to remain entrenched in your personal opinion and selective application of it, I'll understand. It's only human!

As for where you got your ideas from (as few ideas are original, we usually learn things from other people):

http://vimeo.com/21703179

So you're being selective and expressing favoritism for Christianity by blindly taking claims of verifiable origin from Christian anti-Islamic polemicists, then turning around and criticizing Islam under the false pretense of attacking religion in general for the sake of rationality. 

&gt; I don't think so. They have a book that tells them to kill people, and they say it is perfect... I don't think so. Christians aren't perfect either; far from it. Nor are atheists, but they don't have holy books exhorting them to kill people.

Then you obviously haven't read the Bible. Quite a few of your fellow subscribers of /r/atheism would take issue with your claim that the Bible doesn't contain commandments that contain violence.

So, judging by your rhetoric, it's quite clear that you're expressing favoritism for Christianity. Obviously one popular tactic of non-Christian Christian-apologetics (many Westerners of non-Christian beliefs) is to selectively criticize other parts of Christianity vociferously in order to make it appear as if objectivity is retained.

This is very obviously not the case and now your intentionally inconsistent criticisms are laid bare for all to see. This clearly fits popular definitions of intellectual dishonesty. 

Since there is no argument per say here (we're looking at the same events and forming different opinions on them), then this becomes (by your intention) a case of establishing moral or intellectual authority over the other (by nature an ad hominem affair). And it's one you just lost.

You are very wrong about the 1848 revolution (you have mistaken the century). It wasn't about the Catholics against Protestants at all. 1848 was a civic revolution, it was about about civic freedom against the old feudal system. Even the oppressing Austrians were not bringing back the old feudal system, since they too (like most of Europe at that time) had their own civic revolution. Actually, 1848 wasn't even about the language or ethnicity, half of the population of Budapest at that time was German speaking, and they too, supported the revolution. Actually, 1848, with the erasure of feudalism, and the feudal taxes, even the church tax, was a big move towards secularism. 

&gt;putting God into our constitution, which is against secularism, and thus a serious issue

We are intelligent humans, we can read laws and read a constitution. ""Mentioning"" something is not prohibited to a thinking individual. ""Mentioning"" God in itself means nothing, and can not be categorized. Its the context that is important. Mentioning God, and the religion as a historical factor and tradition is not against secularism. Secularism means, that the parliament cannot make laws with regards to religious beliefs. ""Mentioning"" religion as a historical tradition in the preamble of the constitution has no effect on the secularism on the state.

Hungary is not just the current modern state, it is 1000 years of history too. The communists tried to erase the history so vehemently at times, from books and from minds, that we now have to fight over words, since some oppose even the mention of history in the constitution.

Great Hungarian's names are in the constitution implicitly. If it mentions 1848 and 1956, then it implicitly mentions the revolutionaries who fought those.

Most baptists I know are welcoming of Catholics and such, even though we have doctrinal disagreements. Namely, Baptists don't give the pope any particular sway in Christianity, that's a catholic thing. There are some who are rabidly antipope anticatholic, but mostly it's a doctrinally strong, but friendly disagreement. Some might mistakenly perceive that baptist tend to be fanatic in their denouncement of the pope or something though, and it's occasionally fun to joke, with respect, about these misconceptions. There were much more serious Catholic/Baptist rows in the past, particularly in European nations,but the joke tends to apply to American churches. 

I've heard a few pastors joke in the same way in their sermons.  One baptist pastor was speaking about what makes a baptist a baptist, and then said ""We may have minor disagreements with other denominations, but we're still all Christian brothers and sisters with methodists, lutherans..."" and he goes on a list of various denominations and then finishes as if correcting someone in the pews ""yes, even Catholics"" 

The same pastor was using a quote from a Catholic theologian, I can't remember who exactly, but before he began with it joked ""Uhoh, the pastor's quoting a Catholic in a Baptist church, they're going to faint in the aisles or ride me out on a rail"". This pastor liked to play with the idea of animosity between Catholics and Baptists, both to joke about misconceptions, and also to teach any in the congregation who may harbor some real animosity to be accepting by showing that we share certain beliefs even if we disagree strongly on some others.

Israel is really good at working the UN though, and they have had many close calls and always came through.

In the 90s their chief goal at negotiating was extending issue of land for the Palestinians 10 years so they could settle more land until having to renegotiate.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Conference_of_1991

In return for PARTICIPATING only, they got the UN to revoke the resolution that put Zionism as a form of racism. Isn't it amusing how almost everyone forgets that Zionism was considered a form of racism only 20 years ago?

&gt;Israel eventually agreed to participate, but on condition that the United Nations first revoke United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379, which equated Zionism with a form of racism.

Europe also loves Israel and usually always helps it out in these types of situations. At the same time, its not a good political move for Obama to support this. The republicans haven't found any new ""controversy"" and I'm sure they're waiting for something to jump at.

What will likely happen, if EVER, is something beyond the 1967 line. This new state will probably have very little control over anything, not even its airspace or boarders. It will basically be an area within a state that doesn't really have control over sovereignty.

To give you an idea of what will PROBABLY happen, if EVER, check out the Palestinian papers.

Scroll down on the third link to see a VERY informative data table. I love data tables.

A huge part of eastern party of the land is already settled. Israel's has been planning for this for YEARS because any division in the land brings up the tough question of,

    * Where will you move these settlers?

There are 469 000 people there.

Not including the roads, the checkpoints, and all the blocks on Palestinian movement. These people often use all the water in an area that REALLY needs water.

If you like that, it is a hell of a lot fun (unless you are ridicilously overgeared, then it's a ""blast"". As in ""blast through everything godstyle). It ""wants"" you to rush though, and be efficient in the maps by providing better chance on better loot for beating the timelimit, and clearing all monsters/obiliscs.
And you can see how the ""we won't drop you healtpotions, but the enemies will drop ""instant pickup"" baubles"" system Diablo3 proposes works.

2. The editor: Boring if alone, hillarious when in voice. Sadly lacks the ability to show of your chars outside the maps, other than with their thumbnail system, or external screenshots.  
Enjoyment clearly dependend on your level of personal creative output. Working AGAINST the limitations, and for instance ALWAYS missplacing obvious things to wrong places can result in hillarious monsters.  
Also : hit A for removing the ""symetric"" conditions on items yields other hillarious effects. (Got somehting that looks like a shield? Maybe convert it into a cowboy hat. Got a root that looks silly? Dont hide it small on the back, either provide your char with a horses dong, or complement your cowboy hat with a cigar/pipe, add ""satchel on the side and girdles looking like ammo girdles : instant cowboy.

3. Story/level setup   
Nonexistant. This is the endresult if you watch blizzard casualise WOW, or would have skipped on Diablo2s ""continuous map + port-stones"" feature.
It is ""dirty"" map - results - map -results grinding in 10-15 minute portions (10 for goldmedal). But at least you can ""segment"" your playtime well that way. There is a try of hinting at a global war, but watching a vid while your party waits, or not rushing the timelimit to stop and listen to the muck the female voice says? Not really happening. And the wild porting between planets for no bvious reasons doesn't create a world, but rather an inconsequential backdrop for the grindfest, basicly directly skipping to the ""mephisto run"" phase of D2

4. Bad learning curve. To easy to soon, to many options very fast. ~1 hour in, and you have more heroes abilities and junkitems than to properly disect, and it is only when focusing on ""tried and tested"" ignoring other stuff, that it will feel a bit less daunting (but repetetive at the same time)

5. Conclusion: 
It lacks a lot of obvious features. The interaction between the editor and the shop is not well thought through. It lets you SELL items from the editor, but not convert items to details (removing the stats but creating a cosmetic item), which makes for excessive entering and exiting both screens.
If they get a good feel for threatlevels, (which you can ""test"" if you undergear a level for kicks) it looks like !THE! decent Diablo clone of the last years, if only gameplaywise, and it feels like almost a ripoff of what Diablo3 is going to be, sans ""world/story/continous feel"" but + a hilarious way to actually have individual heros blatantly not looking like anyones. I know my brothers heroes look nothing like mine.

6. Pricetag: 50€?  REALLY EA? You aren't Blizzard. And this doesn't look on par with Diablo 3 for what the differences truelly are. And you reused a good part of another games engine, which is fine, but should show in the price tag. I know the Euro has grown strong lately, and you want a converted amount of $ for your efforts, but the ""normal"" people in europe (as in wasting their time on videogames instead of joining a Yacht club) don't have more ""money"" than before.

Tl:dr. If you are into diablo for the fighting and looting, Darkspore is very fun. It has enough underlying complexity to keep you busy, even to the extend of being overwhelming at times (if you want to play right, and not just ""win"".)
It is by far not a mediocre game, if you like what they are actually trying to do. THe editor certainly sets it apart from games where the differences in characters is either mechainsitic only, or superficial visually at best."

Also, while you can in principle start and shut down a coal plant rather quickly, the director of such a plant (Kohlekraftwerk Mehrum, 750 MW) once informed me that frequent load changes have a significant negative impact on not only the lifetime of the power plant, but also on efficiency and emissions.

On topic of genocide!=war, I completely agree. But, what the news media don't admit is that the so called Armenian genocided was said to start April 24, 1915. Coincidently (or not) this is the same period that Turkey went to War in the WW1 and fought off invading countries like Greece, New Zealand, England, and more. Hundreds of thousands of people in Turkey were killed fighting off invaders. Many Turkish and nonTurkish alike fought on the same limes and it was years after the invading countries lost that they used propaganda to try to weaken the Turkish Republic by claiming genocide. One of the propaganda involved taking a [picture of Ataturk and his dog](http://www.hurriyetusa.com/haberler_foto4/ataturk_fotomontaj_01.gif) and montaging it to look like him and a dead Armenian kid. This original was found from 1924 and compared to the fake magazine cover and this magazine cover was found to be ""shopped"".

But you must understand that it is frustrating that everytime a *bad* news comes from Turkey all the euros come forward from their corners commenting how impossible TR's EU membership becomes with more of this.

What the Euros *must* understand is this:
A decade ago there was a more positive wind towards EU and indeed Turkey and EU **for the first time** agreed to move the candidacy to the next step, traditionally this means you become a member in a few years. All good and well so far.

Next, some countries in EU came up with all sorts of excuses to block  TR's candidacy. All good and well also. If some countries disagree, well, they will do everything in their power to prevent this from happening, through double standards or not (mostly the former in this case)

What the majority of the population in Turkey understood during this time is that:

**Even if we were to join tomorrow, EU cannot help us with solving our problems magically.**

If *anything* good has to happen in TR, it should happen **NOT** because ""it helps joining EU"" but because we need it. And frankly, EU will not help with solving any of those problems, after all who needs another 100 million strong competition in the eurozone ?

That is the popular opinion in Turkey about EU.

EU is simply an excuse for politicians to utter when defending reforms against conservatives, be it military, secularists (yes they also have dogmas) or religious.

So hearing euros going on and on about EU membership is really annoying.

The majority in TR wants those reforms because they're needed not because it helps joining EU. That is not the aim, it's merely something that might happen on the way.

And frankly, if TR comes at a point where it is strong enough for EU to offer membership despite all the cultural differences, we should not join anyways, since it means it will do more good to them than to us."

There's a pattern here.  You ignore substantial arguments and get distracted by individual words and phrases a lot right?  ADHD?  Are you suggesting an individual within the church acted alone in trying to silence Champollion?

&gt;And I would like to make the point that the weather in my city was 2C higher than expected yesterday. That is all.

Are you arguing over the wider social justification for what the church did or not?  If so, I'm afraid you have to let other people do this too, otherwise you're changing the goalposts.

&gt;The first three features you describe (simplicity, stability, predictability) defining your epistemology were true of the Ptolemaic system for over 1000 years.

In the 4th century BCE Aristotle said that all the heavenly bodies moved with uniform motion around the earth.

The problem was, the speed of motion was not consistent; they slowed down and sped up and in the case of planets, changed directions.  In the second century CE, Ptolemy tried to explain the retrograde motions of the planets by suggesting they moved in their own orbits around a central point, which itself revolved around the earth (epicycles).  But it *still* didn't match observations; the size of the retrograde loops would vary, sometimes smaller and sometimes larger. In order to explain the motion, he had to violate the rule that the earth was at the centre by placing it slightly off centre.  This *still* didn't match observations, so he had to introduce the equant, whereby the epicycle itself was revolving about another point different to the centre of the whole circle and different to the position of the earth.
This violated Ptolemy's own key principles of simplicity and uniformity of motion.  It was *never* a neat solution, nor simple or stable.
These things were not, as you claim, true of it for over 1000 years; it was unchallenged in Europe that's more about the lack of astronomy in the dark ages in Europe and the broader history of the collapse of the Western Roman Empire and the classical world than anything else.  Copernicus led the renaissance of astronomy.

&gt;The fourth point continues to not be very useful as to guiding the synthesis of recent discovery into our belief systems.

That's how science works, and it's proved pretty useful so far.  I think you may be confusing discoveries of new evidence (very common) with coming up with new scientific theories (much rarer).

&gt;&gt;It's downright dishonest.
&gt;&gt;you're resorting to deliberately misunderstanding
&gt;&gt;when it looks like you might lose that argument, you limit the debate to scientific justification
&gt;Ok thanks. So now guess what number between 1 and 100 I am thinking of.

I'm guessing you've given up.  Ok then.  I admire you for saying something controversial which you knew people would argue against.  Sorry you only got this far, there's probably some stronger arguments you could have made but I think you took things too personally and read non-existent meaning into things; this may have hindered your ability to counter-argue.

I don't live in Europe. So I cannot answer that. 



&gt; Shari'a law is the word of allah and any other form of government is a sin?

Sharia law is the compilation of Quran and Hadith law and judgements as they are interpreted. And no, governments are not a sin systematically.

The **most extremist of the fundies** think that way. The vast majority of moderate Muslims don't.

2) A theocracy would absolutely be possible.  In most states it would only require a single amendment to their state constitution, and in several it could be argued that it is already allowed.  Look to the south for this to happen, they flirt with this on a regular basis.  In Ron Paul's view, at least from every utterance I've heard the man make, this would be a state's rights issue, just as would discrimination based on race, class, gender, sexuality.  The only argument I've heard against it is ""well people who don't like it will just move to a different state.""  This is not the EU, states are not Nation States (and were not conceived to be), and Americans should not have to worry about being arrested in Kansas for what is completely legal in New York.

3) There were several reasons for the end of slavery in the North, which primarily happened in the single generation after the revolutionary war, almost none of which had to do with progressive thinking.  First, the north never developed a large scale agricultural society on the scale of the south; the climate simply didn't support it.  Second, during the revolutionary war the British soldiers would free all slaves in any area they took.  This made good sense as it caused major disruption to the northern colonies.  
State's rights are the only reason slavery hung around as long as it did, and I think it is telling that state's rights groups have a disproportionately large amount of backing from various white supremacist groups.
The idea that somehow a progressive wave of ethical thinking swept from state to state and convinced them to give up slavery as an institution is simply historically wrong."

Germany is able to export power when the conditions are favourable. Energy consumption roughly follows [these curves](http://wissen.dradio.de/media/files/7/7459f4cc1feb486c91168d3694fd9e9fv1.jpg). When renewables combined with traditional power sources produce more than required, Germany exports. When they produce less, Germany imports.

*When* that happens is up to nature because at the moment there is no way of storing all the excess energy. One has to turn down some plants when too much power is generated and turn them up when the opposite happens. That not only strains the grid but also the plants. And, of course, it costs money.

So, about those 15%. In 2008 Germany produced about 640 TWh of energy and exported ~22 TWh more than it imported. I'm not sure where you got 15% from, but anyway, that's only about 3% of the total electricity production. Even the most pro-renewable sources I found didn't go over 6% export for 2010. 
If it's bad weather and we can't get solar or wind power, we instantly lose about 8% of that capacity. I.e., there are times when Germany is about 2-5% short. With the continuing out-phasing of nuclear and coal power plants, that number isn't necessarily going to get better. On the contrary, there will be more unreliable power sources.

And that at a time when we will be moving towards electro-mobility, i.e. when the electrical power requirements might go up about 25% over the next decades.

People want to use pump storage, but that is rather inefficient (pumping up 1m^3 of water 100m stores only about as much energy as 40g of gasoline or 2.6mg of natural uranium contain) and only doable in certain parts of Europe, so it needs a very good power grid to distribute the power all over the continent.

I think his analysis of the problem is largely correct, unless I am missing something. His proposed solution is the problem.

He appears to be arguing that the countries in the EU have too much independence, which leads to mutual suspicion and poor coordination of economic interests, and that the solution is to have even more democratically unaccountable centralization of political and fiscal decision making.

He proposes to bring the banking system under centralised political control:

*Bringing the banking system under European supervision, rather than leaving it in the hands of national authorities...*

The next step would further remove national sovereignty:

*Second, to create an even playing field, the risk premium on the borrowing costs of countries that abide by the rules will have to be removed. This could be accomplished by converting the bulk of their sovereign debt into Eurobonds.*



Soros is a bad actor, a political extremist in a suit, with immense power and influence. I wonder how much he is responsible for the current worldwide financial crisis?

&gt;And I'm not as well versed in economic theory as you, but it seems to be pretty obvious that drugs enjoy an price inelasticity of demand. That is, due to the nature of the drug, demand has nothing to do with price.

This isn't exactly true. Americans switched from being a beer drinking people to being a liquor drinking people during prohibition because the costs were too high to transport beer. Meth became popular because the costs of other drugs went up due to enforcement and so on.

&gt;Why are fruit and vegetables mainly imported and agriculture as a source of employment and revenue in the US decreasing each year? Because due to the cheap substitutes imports offer, the Us can't compete.

Well, there are actually plenty of fruits and vegetables grown in the US. California and Florida are pretty well known for growing oranges. Washington and New England grow apples. The entire Midwest exports a significant amount of corn, wheat, and soybeans. In fact, it could be said that the [US is the largest agricultural exporter on the planet](http://www.mapsofworld.com/world-top-ten/world-top-ten-agricultural-exporters-map.html). Again, your facts aren't exactly correct.

Further, the reason why agricultural employment is decreasing is due to technology, and this has been happening since the sixteenth century with the agricultural revolution in Europe and has been a worldwide phenomena. This is actually the reason why so many people can work in the cities."

Actually capitalism doesn't do too badly in terms of concentration of income provided it is combined with a democratic system. Non democratic countries tend to do poorly at GINI coefficients. 

E.g. see here

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gini_Coefficient_World_CIA_Report_2009.png

or here

https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2172.html

China, Burma and Vietnam 

Scandinavia is essentially Social Democratic and does better on GINI coefficients than the UK. Still Social Democracy could be viewed as a version of capitalism which attempts to minimize inequality aggressively. Certainly it has little in common in terms of political structures with communism or Chavez style socialism. 

In South America Venezuela's 21st Century Socialism has actually performed worse at reducing GINI coefficients than its neighbours. So have Chavez aligned countries like Nicaragua and Honduras.

http://en.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ft7ox/hugo_chavez_interviewed_by_the_bbc_democracy_is/c1iiv25

&gt; This table indicates the rate by which a country's inequality - measured by the Gini coefficient - has declined since 2000. The table stops at 2006 or a later date; unfortunately it does not say which countries have data until 2006, and which countries have data after that.
&gt;
&gt; All in all the table paints a bright picture: inequality is down in most countries, from Brazil to Mexico to Argentina.
&gt;
&gt; Several countries, however, stand out as exceptions. The most notable is Venezuela, which has been governed by President Hugo Chavez since 1999. Under Mr. Chavez, inequality has barely decreased. When compared to other countries, Venezuela has on done worse than average.
&gt;
&gt; Since so much of Mr. Chavez's political messaging rests upon his appeal to the poor, this is a startling failure. Mr. Chavez proudly characterizes himself as a socialist, determined to reduce income inequality and redistribute wealth more evenly. Yet after more than a decade of rule, inequality has barely budged - in stark contrast to the rest of Latin America.
&gt;
&gt; One finds that this is the case with a number of Chavez-aligned countries. Anti-American President Daniel Ortega governs Nicaragua, and former anti-American President Manuel Zelaya ruled Honduras until 2009. In both countries the presidents are (or were) left-wing anti-American hardliners committed to socialism and helping the poor. In both countries income inequality has actually increased.

Of course too little income inequality is not necessarily a good thing because it reduces incentives. Still the extreme inequality you see in places like China risks a social explosion.

In fact it's no coincidence that organisations like the Labour Party and the various European democratic left wing parties got their first taste of power in the 1930's because that was a time when it seemed that democratic capitalism was endangered by rising inequality. All of these parties essentially tried to reduce inequality without a fundamental change to the political system. And to a large extent they succeeded.

I'd expect GINI coefficients to settle at a higher level under the Conservatives than under Labour."

Ok, thats enough, by you, the UK is the worst religious place in Europe. You don't have a clue about Europe. 

&gt;Your whole argument around ""Hungary is not worse than other EU countries"" is not serious argument.

Since the media law and the new constitution are being attacked by foreign, EU politicians, like the Cohn-Bendit fellow, this argument is the only that counts. If you want to fuck up Hungary, because it mentions God in its constitution, then please first go and fuck with some bigger country first, like the UK. Or if you don't like our media law, then go on and object the French and German media laws, let *them* defend it, since we took most parts of the law from them. 

The EU socialist-liberals just want to mess into Hungarian internal politics, if these issues were even true issues, they should have fight for them in their own countries first. Its like Cohn-Bendit is saying: ""I'm a French liberal, who can't do shit in my own country, but would like to have Hungary punished, for not being liberal enough for my taste.""

For instance, a Han Chinese living along the Yellow River can be expected to be as genetically far removed from another Han living on the Yangtze three or four hundred kilometers to the south as a Frenchman is from a Swede; and that degree of genetic diversity is within an avowedly single ethnic group, the separation between a Han and certain other Chinese ethnic minorities can be expected to be even more extreme.  So there is plenty of variety within the Han Chinese for a fair amount of them to be physically quite foreign to many South Americans—who themselves, naturally, have even more variety among themselves than the Han.

The root of their seemingly similarity probably owes a lot to the stereotypical image of a Chinese in the West being primarily derived from southern Han immigrants who, in contrast to their northern kindred, are typically darker skinned, shorter, brachycephalic skull, et cetera, and the fact that these particular traits also superficially resemble the stereotypical image of a primarily indigenously derived South American.  It also doesn't help that Europeans—who are conditioned to distinguish people based on certain characteristics, such as hair or eye color, that are quite uniform in other racial groups—are notoriously bad at differentiating extra-Europeans.

So ultimately, it is true that certain subsets of the Chinese and South American populations do superficially resemble each other—although they would probably plead to the contrary—that similarity isn't particularly representational of the overall affinity between the two populations.  After all, the ancestor's of the most Native Americans and East Asians probably diverged from a common Mongoloid stock 30-40,000 years ago—which is why some characteristic traits, like ""double eyelids"", are found on the both sides of the Pacific—but that is only around 10,000 years later from when the Proto-Caucasoids separated from the same pool of peoples."

The bank bailouts were much needed to save us from suffering a Depression. Bush, Bernanke, and Obama did a remarkable job with this one.

Again with this ""endless wars"" shit. Wars have been going on since the beginning of time.  The USA is the most powerful country in the history of the world and has chosen to use its power to influence global affairs. It's not a conspiracy.

&gt;props up the prison industrial complex with it's endless wars on substances

&gt;Dude, why did the government pay the railroad barrons over 2 million inflation adjusted dollars per mile of track laid, and why is the railroad industry stagnant in the USA today, even though it thrives in Europe where that didn't happen as much?

Freight railroads are still huge here in the USA. The passenger railroad industry isn't as big in the US as it is in Europe because the environment is different here. Europe is much more densely populated, for one. The Federal Government invested heavily in roads through Eisenhower's Interstate Highway Program. Is Ike part of the conspiracy too? I'm sure lobbyists from companies like Ford and GM worked to make sure that roads were the preferred method of travel, but again, it makes sense that roads are what we have here. The US is more spread out and more newly developed compared to Europe. Rails are fixed and restrictive, roads are made more sense from a logistical point of view and also made us more free than rails would! BTW, I'm in favor of Obama's high speed rail proposal but think that it's still too modest. 

&gt;Anybody can see how the public education system is going to hell and it gets worse and worse every year, yet the money paid into it has gone up every year. Check it out. It's a fact. Do you believe in empirical observation, or not?

The public education system gets more expensive because of many factors including, but not limited to, union wages and benefits and special education. A great visionary, George W Bush sought to change the US educational system and put its K-12 system on a path to be more like the University system, which is the envy of the world. No Child Left Behind simply paves the way for a voucher program. Unfortunately lobbyists and a sorry bunch of elected officials in Congress prevented school choice from ever happening.

Off in the third world there are millions of people who are free to do business under the table, without fear of the Jewish -- I mean government regulators to get in their way. This is because their country is so weak and corrupt there is no enforcement of rules that are in reality much more restrictive than what we have in the US. The same is true for things like drugs and prostitutes! On the way back from the world-famous Banaue Rice Terraces in Ifugao Province I hopped on a van from Solano, Philippines to Baguio City, Philippines to take the journey through the winding mountain roads. This one girl on my row had been trying to go to the USA for three years. She has two preferred cities, Washington DC and Chicago, but the process has proven to be unbeleivably hard. She works as a nurse in Baguio City and her family is in that town of Solano. The pay really is nothing, which is a damned shame since she seems like such a bright and hard-working girl. I'm assuming that you are from the USA, argoff. It's too bad you can't trade places with people like that. You have no idea how good you have it, and have managed to delude yourself into thinking that you are living in some sort of tyranical society when the reality is that the modern western civlization that you live in is the most advanced, most free, and most prosperous society in all of history! 

GTFO of my country, argoff!

Who knows what will happen in 20 years it's pointless to talk about.

In a country the size of America there are few limits when it comes to talent, but it's something that needs heavy work. If England can support a four-tier professional system then the US can certainly manage two.

While I agree that it's hard to state what will happen in twenty years MLS will have had a long-term plan set out and I bet that will reach out for ten years at the very least. With many of the top leagues expressing an interest in setting up academies in the US to help with issues like work permits for transfers and producing top-quality American talent it's certainly something that needs to be thought about in the long-term because the right long-term decisions will dictate what direction the league turns to, towards the transfer market and bringing in talent or towards producing talent from America and acting as its own market.

&gt; I don't think MLS needs a promotion/relegation system, but I do think it would be enjoyable to watch.

This is what America really needs, and this is why I think it is 100% guaranteed to happen in the long-term future of MLS. Sports fans often talk of discontent with American sports and the World Cup showed that America can truly support football at its highest level. Club football is something that Americans need to support and at the moment MLS has trying to play the likes of the NFL and MLB at a game they've been playing and building for decades. It's just not going to work in the long-term and MLS will simply die out if it doesn't continue to grow with the footballing world.

It won't be long until MLS has filled out its two conferences, and from that position the only changes left to make are in regards to the league itself. If the USA had landed the World Cup over Qatar then I would believe that promotion and relegation were ten years away, and I still believe that one of the incentives to FIFA for America getting the World Cup on the next bid will definitely be the further development of MLS as a league.

&gt; The average American sports fan is fearful enough of anything European, that i would be happy with 1 successful soccer league that is regularly played on tv.

Promotion and Relegation are not European. They're adopted all around the world, from Japan to Egypt to Brazil. This is yet another reason why America will adopt the system sooner rather than later, because it's THE system for football."

My position is polarised, *obviously* but the emotion kinda stems from the fact that conservative policy has meant I've had to watch my friends suffer homelessness, starvation, walk miles (literally) to get to work, etc, etc. One is an Iraq vet ffs. It's ridiculous! So when I see any bs like this about restriction of employment rights, I know that it inevitably leads to more misery for ordinary people under the rubric of economic progress. It's just bull. I was going to go do the research for this but I got bored. &gt; . &gt; Also, I keep a good eye on the news. And I study social science at a world leading institution, so as much I enjoy posting flamebait on the internet I do actually know what I'm talking about. Take for example, the rise of the industrial mode of production and capitalist class that began - actually around 1700 with the massive increase in global trade (it didn't start it just increased) due to the colonial prospecting of Europe and the enslavement of Africans, the indigenous populations of South America &amp; the Carribean, the influx of wealth from these exports, sugar, silver ( well that's a whole other story about the silver but anyway ) gold and so on, kick started the machine age &amp; fed Enlightenment Europe. So that's kinda how the capitalist mode of production gained momentum; through the enslavement and immiseration of millions of people in order to elevate a (bunch of mercenary pirates)  merchant class and hence to create the capitalist class that could rise adjacent to the old aristocracy - the important point about all this is what happened in relation to urbanisation and capitalist prospecting after this point. Look at land rights in parts of South America - people ( the peasantry) were displaced on massive scale to make way for landowners with commercial interests, they then flooded to the urban outskirts of large cities, same as in a lot of places in Europe ( England had it's fair share, Dickensian London say.) and in Africa after the local subsistence methods were upset by encroaching different value systems. So what you got left with in these places ( and in the Caribbean too, since after emancipation - echoes of America here - no one really wanted slaves to stick around/own land etc never mind *pay* them) was a burgeoning underclass of poor who had effectively been created by the emergent capitalist mode of production. We still have this problem, which never really existed before, and what's worse is that it actually becomes necessary to have what some have termed a 'surplus humanity' in order to drive down wages, reinforce the ideology of corporate interests and keep structural violence abounding in order to maintain control. Without this, you couldn't replace an employee easily, for example, driving down wages would be really hard to do if at all possible. The poor, the underclass, are not *an anomaly* of the system we have now they are *a product* of it. Why? Because this is how the capitalist system creates profit, by driving down the cost of production to a point where the modes of production are inhumane, because they literally have to be, and this therefore is how corporate interests also operate, not merely through economic ( structurally violent) means but through the production of the ideology and culture that reinforces the obfuscation of history and the mechanics  underpinning the economy. That right there is a fragment of the reasoning behind why I hate Republicans: they are pandering to corporate interests all the time and corporate interests by their very definition are inhumane. 

I wish I could call to mind the myriad of sources that inform my horribly broad, historical perspective on modern politics blah blah blah , but you should read this essay called 'The Great Cat Massacre' if you can get it ( maybe I could mail it to you) it's about the revenge of some typesetters in France during the 16thC. I wondered why I was the only person in my class to get the joke - but it's a good indicator of what the savagery of exploitation can do to a person anyway. (exploiter &amp; exploited) 

 Also, I haven't disregarded feudalism &amp; associated problems, social mobility, notions of technological &amp; human progress inc science, possible solutions to all the aforementioned crap etc etc. I just don't have time to write an overview on the capitalist mode of production in relation to world history and global corporate interests today. 

I hope that you have a bit more faith in humanity now lol.

Without exclusive rights medical research won't be profitable -- it is very expensive to develop new drug and do the trials but then other companies will just copy the end product.

So ""market forces"" would drastically cut medical research and development of new drugs.

Especially with so-called ""orphan drugs"":

&gt; An orphan drug is a pharmaceutical agent that has been developed specifically to treat a rare medical condition, the condition itself being referred to as an orphan disease. The assignment of orphan status to a disease and to any drugs developed to treat it is a matter of public policy in many countries, and has resulted in medical breakthroughs that may not have otherwise been achieved due to the economics of drug research and development. In the US and EU it is easier to gain marketing approval for an orphan drug, and there may be other financial incentives such as extended exclusivity periods.

Which is exactly what I said. Civil and religious rights, *not* political rights. And certainly not the all encompassing ""nothing was to be done against the indigenous people"" that you proposed as if there was a legally established collective right for Palestinian self-determination a century ago, whereas there in fact wasn't one and that is *by design.*

&gt; Palestine was a Class A mandate

No, it was not, it is a sui generis mandate, that has distinct outlier properties which none of other mandates exhibit, and if you are unable to decipher that from the law yourself or by reading others that's your own problem.

&gt; You already indirectly admitted it by recognising Palestinian nationality law and the non-transfer of power to foreign states.

No, that provision has nothing to do with the Palestine Mandate [not] being a ""Class A"" mandate. 

&gt; At the time of ratification of the mandate of Palestine Palestine was actually one of the most developed Arab states in the region in terms of gross domestic product, literacy, life expectancy. When the League refers to states deserving class A status, Palestine would have had to have been at the fore.

That's completely irrelevant because, in the end, LoN wrote the Mandate to be the complete opposite of what other Mandates strived for. You are deliberately attempting to shoehorn the Mandate into the ""class A"" group whereas it was understood by everyone, including the Trustee, to not be so. In any case, Palestine was not a ""state,"" but a region under the Ottoman empire. States have attributes that Palestine has never possessed and in every sense it was a state no more than ""Latin America"" or ""Eastern Europe"" was a state.

&gt; But even the link you provided constantly refers to Palestine as a country.

A ""country"" as a region is distinct from ""state"" as a political entity. That you wish to dismiss arguments based on the authorship is dishonesty.

Politics - start with this, since everything else will depend on it.  I envision a one-world government or a federation.  Universal civil rights.  No wars.  Basically Gene Roddenberry was right on this.  In fact, I honestly think this will happen in our lifetime, at least the peace part. Basis: the continued 'arc' of progress over the last 50 years with respect to human rights, civil rights, the EU, etc.  

Technology - biotechnology will obviously be huge.  I imagine very prolonged lifespans, perhaps &gt;1000 years, once the aging process is understood.  We may even have the sophistication to download our consciousness into a computer program, once we understand the material basis for it.  Energy - fusion-type production will be the norm for power plants.  Computers - just a guess, but at some point I think we will have more computing power than we need to run our lives and institutions, so it's unclear whether this will continue to expand at the rate it currently does.  The most difficult to predict is technology because all of this could become a reality within 50 years, or may never happen.   

Economy - I believe we will eventually have de facto socialism because resources will be abundant enough and efficient enough that there is enough for everyone without high cost.  I think free software is an example.  There will still be a private economy, however, but it will mostly be for ""optional"" consumer purchasing such as entertainment, clothing, transportation (?).  

Environment - better than it is today.  Global warming will be controlled through bio-engineering and reduction of emissions.  A gradual trend toward more environmentally friendly practices.  

Culture and Arts - impossible to predict, but a trend toward uniformity is probably going to be the norm.  I think it will be like the U.S. - a uniform popular culture with local customs and numerous subcultures.  The ""Balkinization"" of culture that currently exists to some degree will continue to fade out.  

Sounds utopian, but I think compared to say, 1000 years ago, we are living in a utopia currently. "

I have a Core2Duo with 4gb RAM and an ATI 4850 and the game runs between 28-50 FPS (average 35-40) at medium/high settings. Unless you have no idea of what you're doing, this game doesn't run under 40 FPS on anything above an i3 and a decent graphics card (GTAIV requirements: CPU &gt; GPU).

There are other matters to be considered, you'll be required to make at least three logins before you can play the game (Steam, Rockstar Social Club, GFWL), and the cell phone interface is very annoying. Driving is not as awkward once you get the hang of it.

Just remember that you should take your time with the main storyline, or the game will get boring. Thankfully, there are many more things to see and do in Liberty City. This -very ambitious- game is a lot like life, you have to learn to savor the little things. Riding a Taxi and listening to the hours and hours of available Radio are some of my favorites.

About the characters, I think that's where Rockstar's european sensibilities come into play. Niko is too much like every one of us, doing the best we can with situations that are beyond our control, and I think that he could have been better used as a supporting character. It's just an opinion, of course, but for me the least access we have to his thoughts the more we can concentrate on his actions (but that's too long to explain and too hard without spoiling anything). My point is, a character who was a little more detached from the situation would be some help with all the work you're expected to do.

TL;DR It should run ok. The game is not without its problems, but once you find your pace you'll love it.

The worst you can say about his approach is that it is merely commonsensical: decide the issues case-by-case while holding some idea of values and interests in mind. Many who say they want more consistency than this (typically by asking some variant of “What about Zimbabwe?”) do so not because they really believe that foreign policy can be run by an algorithm but in order to embarrass Mr Obama in any way they can.

Well said. I think there's been a lot of talk about us needing a ""clear"" set of standards, but it seems to me that is naive: the world doesn't provide clear scenarios from which to choose from. Every situation has to be approached with the ""hard work"" of deciding how it is similar or different from past events, what we have learned from those past events, etc. You can't have a pure doctrine of non-interventionism any more than you can have a pure doctrine of intervening *everywhere*. Those looking for easy answers are destined to be disappointed, and hopefully embarrassed. 

&gt;Mr Obama’s hope is that America’s low profile will make the war more palatable not only to the Muslim world but also to the economy-fixated voters at home who question whether America can still afford to play its traditional leadership role. What he may soon discover is that modesty extracts a price of its own. By sharing the leadership with others, he has made his policy hostage to the limited mandate (no use of force for regime change) imposed by the United Nations and the limited means of his allies in Europe and the Middle East. It may not be a doctrine, it should not be a surprise, but nobody can deny that it is a gamble.

Also well said. A fair and sober-minded article.

Firstly, much of the criticism is from people who obviously pirated or used but did not understand the methodology behind Version 2, which is 17 years old at this point. While it's still an excellent course, the subsequent versions have had an enormous number of improvements, especially as relate to intuitiveness of the interface and overall user-friendliness.


The goal of RS is to help a learner *acquire* a language rather than study about one. To that end, it's entirely in immersion, and it's fully interactive, so when you are learning Chinese, it's entirely in Chinese from the beginning, and you're prompted to use Chinese every step of the way, be it selecting images, selecting words, speaking, or doing exercises that develop your ability to read and write. There is in-house voice comparison that uses both full spectrograms and also a more intuitive graph that's easier for a layman to read, if you choose to use them.

**The Course**- the course is organized around different situations, and around core lessons that are a half-hour, followed by supplementary lessons which deconstruct and reinforce what you've learned. **The idea is to teach you the grammar of the language through having you actively engage  with it and constantly giving feedback, while doing so in an environment where you're immersed in *correct* language being used by native speakers**. And it does this, while covering an enormous amount of vocabulary. The software can be divided into 3 components: course, studio, and world. The course teaches you the language in the core lessons, and then reinforces what you've seen in focused activities. **Studio is unlimited access to live sessions with native speakers who coach you in using what you've learned**. Let me reiterate that: you have live coaching from native speakers, in immersion, umlimited for the duration of your subscription to the online components, which comes 3+ months free with the software. World is then games and activities with other learners (including games you can play with native speakers of your target language), and stories which get progressively longer and more complex.

**Strengths** you develop a very strong ear for the language, an intuitive grasp of the grammar (this was most pronounced for me with my sudden ability to confidently use the ""ba"" structure unique to Chinese), you get constant feedback, you have the ability to fine-tune your pronunciation with voice-comparison that is now very sophisticated, and you have access to free hour-long sessions with native speakers whose job it is to coach you in using the language confidently and effectively. If you use the software right, you have a very strong foundation, and you're thinking *in Chinese* rather than trying to translate. You also don't develop the quirks a lot of non-native speakers do, like bobbing their heads ridiculously as a physical tic as they try and recall pronunciation.

**Weaknesses**: I won't speak to V2, because I'm replying elsewhere about that, so I'm assuming that when you ask about RS, you're actually interested in the current software. In my opinion, the weaknesses of the Chinese program are that it can teach you to read quite well, but not to write by hand (although using a computer and typing with pinyin is a breeze after using RS). It also does not cover *chengyu* in the course, although you do see some in World, and will invariably learn some in Studio, and can ask the coaches for more if you want. Resultative compliments and verbal coordination could be covered more explicitly. All in all though, it gives you what you need o speak Chinese comfortably, and to be able to continue to learn much more quickly while interacting in the language rather than poring over textbooks.

**Other considerations**: there is a 6 month money-back guarantee so you can try it and send it back. 

**About me**: I have my undergraduate degree in East Asian Studies (specifically China Studies/ *zhongguo wenhua*) from University of Toronto, and graduated from a 5 year Specialist program in 4 years, with distinction. I got Rosetta Stone in that 4th year, and noticed a marked difference in my ability to comprehend and to use the language effectively. So I also have experience with damn near everything else. I decided to apply to work for RS based on my experience with their Chinese course, and have since learned French (and am now certified at level B2 in the Common European Framework), Dutch, and Spanish, and am learning Arabic, although Chinese and French remain my main passions. I do not work in social media (nor am I really supposed to be on here at all), and I will not in any way be paid for this, nor would I expect if you bought it that commission would in any way make it back to me; I just feel strongly about the course, and know quite a few people who have used it successfully. Frankly, if I'd known then, I would have used RS and tested into Chinese 3 and actually gotten something out of Chinese 3, Chinese 4, and Classical Chinese other than just headaches.

Please feel free to ask *any* questions and I'll do my best to answer them. If they're about Chinese or second language acquisition I guarantee I know more than 99% of the other respondents you'll get here."

Your questions have mostly been answered, I'll just give you my opinion, as a Belgian high school student. Depending on the high school and the cities you're gonna be in, you'll be faced with a few Flemish lessons here and there, but you probably won't have to use the language, most Flemish people know French or English(and it's really sad that we, the walloons, can't say the same. I wish my people weren't lazy when it comes to language, but we're not the only ones to blame, the Communauté Française made it that way). 

High school here is very different from in the US from what I gathered. It's split in 6 years, going from the first year to the sixth (Called ""La rhéto""). You'll probably be put in rhéto or in the 5th year like many other exchange students. Here, you can't choose lessons like you would in the US, there are a few options available (Generally, Language, Science, Social Science and Economics) and in these branches, some more options, like the amount of math you get or the different languages you want to study. There aren't many excursions or activities related to the school in Wallonia, though this depends on the school. One thing that's common to almost every school is that there's a 7-days long trip when you're in rhéto, called ""Voyage rhéto"", which is basically a holiday. That's the best part (I'm going to Turkey with my school for that occasion in two weeks :)). 

On average, a school day is from 8AM to 3-4PM, with a lunch break in the middle, and a few empty hours where you get to go to the study hall or, if you're in rhétos, to the ""local rhétos"" (basically a study hall without a teacher to keep an eye on you). People, high school students here, are quite friendly (though lack maturity from my experience) and like to party, a lot. Though it seems to be less and less true the younger the generation is. Try to go and talk to the people once you're here though, because if they feel you're annoyed or not too enthusiastic when people talk to you, most students are gonna leave you alone, partly because they don't want to bother you but also because you'll appear ""cold"". In general though this isn't an issue. :) If you're here during the summer, there are festivals that are among the best in Europe, so feel free to buy yourself a ticket for Dour or Pukkelpop or whichever you like. 

And, Belgian french isn't so different from french french. Some accents are just extremely funny to hear or imitate, and there's the ""nonante / septante"" distinction, but that really is about it. 


So, a little about you now :). Where/when are you gonna be staying? Will you be in Belgium with Rotary or with another agency? Why did you choose our beautiful country? :D"

The idea that no Muslim political office was created to counter those created for Jewish is fallacious.  There was the office of the Grand Mufti Of Palestine, the Palestinian Supreme Muslim Council, they even had [political parties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Political_parties_in_the_British_Mandate_of_Palestine).

&gt;That's completely irrelevant because, in the end, LoN wrote the Mandate to be the complete opposite of what other Mandates strived for. You are deliberately attempting to shoehorn the Mandate into the ""class A"" group whereas it was understood by everyone, including the Trustee, to not be so.

Which is why I referenced the White Papers written and adopted by the trustee, because by 1939 they had stated that Arab Palestinians were to take over control of Jewish immigration.

You're projecting when you say I'm trying to shoe-horn anything.  Everybody knew what the situation was in 1920s and 30s Palestine.  The narrative you're now presenting is the cuckoo and by far the younger.

&gt;That you wish to dismiss arguments based on the authorship is dishonesty.

No, it's recognising a lack of credibility.  You don't get to say that I'm being the revisionist when I'm providing and quoting texts from 1917, 1922, 1939 when you're bringing a much more recent an argument from an author who works for AIPAC and has a website!

&gt;States have attributes that Palestine has never possessed and in every sense it was a state no more than ""Latin America"" or ""Eastern Europe"" was a state.

It had its own political offices, its own flag, its own currency, its own leaders, its own rights, provisions, its own political parties.  It had its own borders...what specifically are you thinking of?"

We don't even have enough stable pro football clubs to fill 2 divisions, let alone 3 or 4 and until that changes there's no point in discussing pro/rel. Furthermore, assuming that all of this changes and it becomes viable in the future, then what reason would the owners in MLS who paid tens of millions to get into the league have to accept they could now be relegated?

People need to accept that American sports culture is different and that's not an entirely bad or good thing. I would love to have a 4-tiered pyramid with pro/rel and good support at every level, but if it means that MLS becomes like EPL or La Liga where the richest teams in the biggest markets dominate and win everything then IMO it's not worth it. The NFL does well here because a publicly-owned team from a town of just 100,000 people can win the championship.

PS: to all the people saying that American soccer won't take off until we have pro/rel, you're wrong. American soccer won't take off until people like YOU stop finding excuses not to support it. A lot of those who complain about the lack of pro/rel here also complain about the quality of MLS.

Europe values freedom and equality while the middle eastern immigrants want sharia law and want to bring their oppressive culture from the middle east and make it law in europe.  Basically have a bunch of little saudi arabias or syrias or something.

You see the conflict and riots that result.  Allow these people to become citizens and vote and as they produce more and more babies eventually they will be the majority and will vote in those laws.  Now your amazing country is a shit hole and not what it originally was because you let people with a conflicting view come in and change it.

Well, here, have a nested TIL:  The Roman Empire probably did more harm to the world in crushing other civilizations than it did in collapsing itself.   Most people don't know it, but [the Celts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts) weren't the leaf-wearing forest barbarians the Romans painted them as, but rather an extremely advanced and complex civilization.  They had a network of cities all across Europe, linked by roads and common culture.  And they actively traded with Asia, with whom they were generally peaceful, and with Rome itself!  They were especially fond of Roman wine.  

And then the Romans wiped them out A)because they wanted revenge for a brutal attack the Celts launched on Rome *hundreds of years before*, and B)because the Celts were living on top of an unimaginably vast series of gold veins.  So they took them over and then didn't just wipe them out, but actually made a very credible attempt at erasing the Celts' very cultural existence.  To literally unwrite them from history by simply destroying anything of theirs that contradicted the Roman story.

The Romans -at least the Roman Empire - were bullies who cared about very little except expanding their own power and culturally erasing anyone who opposed them.   And it wasn't just the Celts - the Goths got the same treatment, as well as several others.  Basically, leaving aside even the question of whether the Celts would have been superior custodians of Europe, what we have here is a deliberate attack on history itself.  

What the Romans did to the Celts has created a wound in our world's history that will never be fully healed.  The damage the Romans did is still ongoing."

Once I was diagnosed I cut gluten out of my diet completely and I felt EXACTLY how you described, it was like some horrible curse had been lifted from me and I had seemingly infinite energy, focus, happiness, etc. It felt great. I have gotten used to this as I now realize that this is what normal is supposed to feel like, but compared to how I was before it's like night and day. 

Anyway my point is, there is a slim possibility could have an auto immune disorder or something that may have an easy fix. Celiac's disease occurs in about 1% of the population and higher in males with northern European ancestry, there is a very simple blood test that can give a 90% certain diagnoses. "

But she did say that, she did give that speech

the fact is Angela is saying what much of denmark, sweden, finland and other european countries are too politically correct to say and that is that there is a problem when it comes to immigrant cultures, particularly african/muslim ones when it comes to integrating or assimilating with the european cultures of the countries they are moving to.

OK, so, we have a LOT of Roman influences in our culture.  Everything from the structure of our government to our preferred types of popular entertainment.  Yeah, we've toned down the bloodshed, but we still have staged gladiatorial fights today - just look at Wrestlemania.

So where'd all this influence come from?  After all, Rome collapsed before even the Vikings had stumbled onto America.  Obviously, it was via the Renaissance.  All of the old Roman stuff had been lost\forgotten for centuries, but then the Renaissance rediscovered it and found out how great it was and reshaped society in the process.  We learned all this in grade school, right?

Well, here's the thing: more and more, it's looking like what the Renaissance unearthed and took at face value was mostly Roman *propaganda.*  Europe pretty radically shifted many of its cultural ideals and outlooks based not on what the Romans did, but what the Romans claimed they did.  And based on those false claims, we accepted a lot of things in Roman culture as being good that may not have been so good after all.

Like, you know, deliberate suppression of women.  That was reborn in the Renaissance too.   The trend in Europe had actually been moving towards female equality during the Middle Ages, perhaps a ghost of old Celtic beliefs that held on. (Celts were much more gender-equal *and* much more open about sexual matters, two more things that just infuriated the Romans.)  But when they start unearthing these old Roman texts, all of a sudden, women start getting shut up at home again.

So what I'm basically saying is that we mistakenly adopted a bunch of old Roman ideas that we *should* have outgrown, based on the Renaissance thinkers making their own mistake in trusting that the Romans were honest.

&gt;key passages restricting the freedom of the press for private publications

There was never an intent to restrict any freedom of press, only that the requirement of registration of publications be extended to the Internet. The biggest internet-only news portals required registration even previously, and presuming that the government intended to require registration from the thousands (if not hundreds-of-thousands) private blogs, is even technically impossible. The funny part in this one, is that the owner of the biggest and loudest left-leaning (currently opposition) internet-only news portal (index.hu) was actually member of the board, who drafted the law. Ain't that a situation, that the same portal then publishes its opinion about how freedom-of-speech limiting the new law is?

Treating the new law with prejudice, voicing opinions without even reading the law, presuming ill-will from the Hungarian government, generalizing the media law criticism to the whole Hungarian political system, attaching derogatory remarks, titling Hungary a ""lesser"" democracy than the rest of Europe, ""Führerstate"", ""Putinism"", has given a chance to the outgoing corrupt political forces to regain in power, and it is all, that the media law hysteria has done to Hungary.

The other guy is just too simple-minded to realize that the Hippocratic injunction to ""do no harm"" bears a broader interpretation than that of Christian Fundamentalists. It is harmful to a woman to be forced to carry an unwanted child to term, as it limits her in her human potential; it is harmful to the child to grow up an unwanted child, with inadequate care, food and resources; and it is harmful to society to have large populations of such children, who often turn to a life of crime. Crime rates in the US dropped dramatically 15 years after Roe vs. Wade, and careful investigations have ruled out confounding factors and see a strong causative relationship. In general, societies do much better as soon as women are given procreative freedom. Of course decent sex education and contraception are the best prevention for abortion: European countries, where sex ed and contraception follow modern free world standards, have much lower rates of teen pregnancy and abortion than the socially backward USA.

Appealing to Hippocrates is also no help to the argument because all human civilizations outside of Christianity practiced contraception and abortion. 

[This article about witch hunts in the Middle Ages](http://freetruth.50webs.org/A2d.htm#Witches2) explains why the Catholic Church developed a murderous rage against all forms of birth control.

So historically we had this state of affairs:

&gt; Witch hunters such as the English William Perkins (1555-1602) explicitly wanted to exterminate the ""good"" witches:

&gt;&gt; ""It would be a thousand times better for us if all witches, but especially the beneficial witches would suffer death."" [23]

&gt; Among native American Indian women alone more than 200 plants, roots and other medicines were used as means of birth control. 
Indeed modern research shows that likewise in European societies contraception was anything else but exceptional. Many of these methods have been clinically tested and a considerable number of them were indeed found to be functional.

So why the problem with this as of about 1350?

&gt; But why should the authorities have been interested? Why at this time? How is it that the church initiated the witch hunts and persecution of birth control? What had happened at the end of the middle ages? 

&gt; In the years 1348-1352 the Black Death had struck Europe. The plague - with additional occurrences in subsequent decades until 1385 - resulted in the so-called European Population Catastrophe

&gt; ...Responsible modern authorities estimate that in 1348-9 about a third of the population perished

&gt; ... the Church was not only the biggest feudal landowner with an average 20-30% of all fertile land in the whole of Europe as Church property, but therefore also suffered the severest losses in income from the losses in serfs due to the plague. Hence the Church's intent to repopulate its estates with serfs. [Basically, serfs at that time led a life of slavery].

&gt; So we are no longer surprised to find that as early as 1360 authorities began to execute ""wise women"" and midwives in their villages [46]. We now understand what the Inquisitors had in mind when they wrote:

&gt;&gt; ""No one is more dangerous and harmful to the Catholic Faith than the midwives,"" [47]

&gt; preaching that procreation is a duty ordained by God, where the Catholic Faith simply meant the dominating position of the Church in medieval economy.

&gt; [The general populace] considered birth control as ""good"" or ""white"" magic, just as people today do not want an unlimited number of children. For this reason midwives and ""wise women,"" prominent in the authorities' witchcraft accusations, seldom appear to have been accused of being witches by the populace (who considered them their only source of medical help).

This brought about the strange situation where...

&gt;&gt; ""It is intriguing why so few know now what so many once did."" [50]

&gt; ...So the women of - allegedly so civilized - Christian Europe and the European colonies in the era of 1500 to 1900 were the only women in all the world whose knowledge of sexual matters and birth control methods was practically nil. 

----

So: Because the Church needed to replenish its supply of serfs after the Black Plague, birth control has been reviled ever since. Catholicism's financial greed unwittingly lives on in today's ""pro-life"" movements."

Oh, I fortunately don't work in a full service hotel; this is a two star hotel where we rent one of the spaces to a concierge company which keeps hiring people who literally just arrived to New York and know nothing about this city... what I didn't know about this city for selling it as a travel agent I learnt from working at this hotel.

No, I am not happy with how my career has progressed at all. I have a private European education, a very interesting but seemingly useless MBA in Hospitality, around 15 years of working experience, most of the times at two simultaneous jobs (usually travel agency and hotel)... in Europe I became Groups Manager at one travel agency, international hotel expert at another (this job was part time so management was out of the question), night manager at hotels and finally aide to the manager... 4 star hotels.
And that's as far as it goes. When I arrived to NYC, all that I had advanced was totally disregarded. I am right now a shift manager at this little place.

I definitely have a passion for it. I love helping out, I love the little details in hospitality and travel. I love crunching numbers. I love marking and it's easy for me to work on marketing plans for the things I like (both hotels and travel destinations)... but is it worth it? Lately my determination is starting to shake.

The pay is not great considering the responsibilities, going corporate is next to impossible unless someone at corporate notices you, but you have to have worked for them for a while and I usually like working for more personal non-chain hotels.
A complain by a guest is taken much more seriously than fifty recommendations by Management. There are a thousand and one little things in my head pushing to get out right now, so I can explain how horrible this work can become, how disregarded by everyone, from guests to your own employers, but I can't seem to find the words.

I am so burnt out I am thinking of writing a travel guide or starting a water purifying facility in Peru (that's not a joke).

I used to work at full service hotels, started at the base and ended up managing and every step has its own painful moments, although the higher you get, surprisingly, the least painful and stressful it gets (one would think it's the other way around).
Was it worth it? Maybe, but probably not. Had I studied a more generic MBA I may now be working in an office at Chase without having to suffer the same issues every day from different people, in fifty different languages, many of which I cannot comprehend or communicate proficiently in.

Sorry for being so crude about it, but hospitality, which people see as something quite light, asides from being very stressful, is horribly unrewarding. You have to like it a lot to do it correctly and even if you do, there will still be issues."

""Lively released a half-hearted condemnation: ""It should be no surprise… that modern Ugandans are very unhappy that homosexual political activists from Europe and the US are working aggressively to rehomosexualise their nation.""

As for Defend the Family's innocence - they're a hate organization that advocates, among other things, criminalizing sodomy to ""prevent the spread of the homosexuality"" 
&gt;Yet sodomy, especially anal sodomy, deserves to be criminalized. Although characterized by
homosexuals as a loving act, sodomy is an act of sadism and violence against the receptive partner that
often results in serious damage to the body, especially over time. That one partner consents to this
abuse should not sanctify it in the eyes of the law, any more than wife-beating should be sanctioned if a
wife consents to be beaten by her husband. Indeed, the health complications from sodomy can be
more dangerous to one’s health than a physical beating.
Perhaps the most important function of sodomy laws is to deter to the spread of homosexuality in
society.

Lively and Defend the Family can claim now that they're against the Ugandan bill, but they were instrumental in it being proposed in the first place.  

I would say the language TonyBLair used was inflammatory and over the top, but the fact of the matter is, Defend the Family is a hate group that's blamed Nazism on homosexuals, and advocated for the criminalization not just of homosexuality, but also of advocacy for homosexuality in the United States, and claimed that there's a link between homosexuality, pedophilia and incest.

Small thin bureaucracies that citizens can watch in action are always much more efficient than huge *deep, opaque* ones subject to all sorts of gaming buried within, forever hidden from the voters.

The Scandanavian citizenry having a much better view of how government bureaucracies really operate may also explain why thier countries are so far ahead of the USA in adopting reforms such as breaking the govt monopoly on postal services, adopting a full voucher system for public schools in Sweden, etc., etc. -- reforms that are denouced as ""radical right-wing ideas to destory government"" by the left in the US.

' ...

' The proportion of our GDP that goes on research and development is 4.8 percent. The OECD average is 2.5%, and the US is about the same. So Israel is far ahead in civilian R&amp;D.

' ...

' Israel is No. 1 worldwide for patents for medical devices per capita. But we’re not No. 1 in patents per capita overall. There are five or six countries ahead of us, including Korea, Japan, the US, maybe Sweden. And those countries, with the exception of the US, don’t have so many start-ups. ...

' ...

' ... Tel Aviv University is ranked 11th in the world in citations per faculty member – how often people are cited by their fellow academics. That’s a figure you can’t play with. TAU is behind Harvard and MIT but ahead of Oxford, Cambridge and Yale. ...

' We need to update our narrative. The Jewish narrative has changed over the years. We need to enter the 3.0 era.

' 1.0 was the era of the Bible. What we Jews were about then was purpose. And our purpose was to transform the pagan world – the world of child sacrifice and extreme immorality. Along with Christianity and Islam, we succeeded to spread a message of one God and of ethics. The pagan world was transformed. Mission accomplished. And we grew as a people. But then we faced the destruction of the Temple and exile.

' And that took us into the 2.0 era. 2.0 was the era of survival. In that mode, what we Jews were about was survival, and the dream of a return, and messianism. We were hoping we’d be around to see the future. That 2.0 period lasted 2,000 years.

' ...

' Today, we’ve still got this narrative: They tried to kill us, we won, let’s eat. That’s how we still think of our narrative.

' ...

' ... We must update the narrative, to: They tried to kill us, we won, now we’re changing the world! That takes us to the word “miracle” in the book’s subtitle. ...

' ...

' ... I want to end by restating my central conviction about start-ups and their potential for transforming the Jewish state. Our purpose, the Jewish people’s purpose, is not to survive. The purpose of surviving is to have a positive impact. It so happens that innovation, and solving world problems, is the main means by which we have been having a positive impact so far, and it offers potential for even greater impact in the future.

' But beyond that, once we start thinking in terms of the positive impact we can have, and not just in terms of our survival, this has implications across the board, not limited to the Start-Up Nation perspective. It has implications for everything from the macro to the micro, from our foreign policy strategy to the way we conduct ourselves when manning roadblocks.

' The truth is that increasing our positive impact on the world already does help toward survival in many ways, but that shouldn’t be the driving force here. Some of the world’s best companies are driven by something in addition to profit, a creative, world-bettering imperative, but that actually makes them much more profitable. This country is being driven, and needs to be more driven, by a creative, world-bettering imperative. I’m convinced that will actually make us more successful in every way, including in the struggle for our survival. '

My gripes with it? Over here it's a bit pricey, but you guys get a good deal on it. I still have to add racks, panniers etc, so this is a factor. I'm not entirely sold by cantilever brakes, and I'd prefer Vs personally. I'd also want to swap out the tyres for something a bit more robust and invest in a Brooks saddle. My LBS mentioned that they would build to specification, but I have no idea if this will end up costing me more £££. It's worth doing a search around for 'LHT which bits to replace' because some forum posters think that there are a couple of essential aftermarket changes to make it the perfect tourer. 

**Kona Sutra:** I'll be honest, this is a really nice bike, and it is incredibly well priced in the UK. It has a Tubus rack as standard, discs, and is pretty much ready for touring. I might change the crankset to 22/32/44 though, for those tough climbs. However, even though you said it's 'beautiful', I'm not a massive fan of the colour scheme. I prefer some of the older model colours, but that's just personal opinion. It might look better in the flesh (this is the dark green/gold 2011 model I'm talking about). There are no Kona dealers near me, so a test ride may be out of the question. However, I'm covered by the DSR (distance selling regulations) so I can return it if I'm not entirely happy. 

While writing this post, I did a little research into my 'gripes'. Firstly, disc brakes + touring. I think this is a non-issue (for me) because a) I really value stopping power on my commute, b) Avid BB7s are fantastic. Another advantage of discs is that you can fit 26"" wheels (Sutra is 700c standard) so if you get stuck somewhere where 700c isn't available, you can just attach a 26"" and keep trundling on. Some people prefer traditional v-brakes or cantis, it's personal preference I guess. If you like discs and trust them for touring, then this bike is equipped perfectly. I don't really have any major issues with this bike, it's fantastic and Kona have a great reputation (if you do a little research, you'll notice that they've been listening to Sutra owners and improving them year on year). 

As you said, good parts. There are compromises, but they are in the right areas and really not a concern. I guess you'd have to remove the barcons if you really don't like them, so that might be extra $$, I don't know.

Also, if you haven't read [this review](http://www.bikeforums.net/showthread.php/593959-2010-Kona-Sutra-Review), read it. Very in-depth look at the Sutra!

That **Devinci Caribou 2** is beautiful. Aluminium frame worries me a little, but if it is made properly and reinforced with tourers loads in mind, it's not really a big deal. Cannondale have some aluminium tourers with good reviews. I don't know much more about the bike to comment on it, sorry!

**Trek 520** - again a touring benchmark. I don't know much about this as it is not easily available in Europe. You'll have to just look at what US owners say on bike forums and the like. 

I'd like to emphasise that I have little experience with serious touring and I've only gone on day rides on a bog standard bike before. The opinions expressed above are mainly drawn from reading lots of touring forums, reviews and listening to others opinions. 

It's a toss up between the Sutra and LHT for me really. I was going to name some other bikes, but most of the ones I've looked at are from UK manufacturers (Dawes, Thorn etc).

It's a difficult decision, but make sure you get it right. A good touring bike will supposedly last 20+ years with proper maintenance, so it makes sense to make one confident decision rather than mess around and have to deal with failures down the line. 

Hope that helps! I'll be keeping an eye on this post :)

Guest Post: Cap and Trade Is a Gigantic Scam

→ Washington’s Blog

As I pointed out in December:

    James Hansen – the world’s leading climate scientist fighting against global warming – told Amy Goodman this morning that cap and trade not only won’t reduce emissions, it may actually increase them:

        The problem is that the emissions just go someplace else. That’s what happened after Kyoto, and that’s what would happen again, if—as long as fossil fuels are the cheapest energy, they will be burned someplace. You know, the Europeans thought they actually reduced their emissions after Kyoto, but what happened was the products that had been made in their countries began to be made in other countries, which were burning the cheapest form of fossil fuel, so the total emissions actually increased…

    See also this and this.

    Environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace are also against cap and trade (and see this and this), as is the head of California’s cap and trade program for the EPA.

    Hansen also told Goodman that (notwithstanding Paul Krugman’s assertions) most economists say that cap and trade won’t work:

        I’ve talked with many economists, and the majority of them agree that the cap and trade with offsets is not the way to address the problem.

    As I have previously pointed out:

        The economists who invented cap-and-trade say that it won’t work for global warming

        European criminal investigators have determined that there is a tremendous amount of fraud occurring in the carbon trading market. Indeed, organized crime has largely taken over the European cap and trade market.

        Former U.S. Undersecretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs Robert Shapiro says that the proposed cap and trade law “has no provisions to prevent insider trading by utilities and energy companies or a financial meltdown from speculators trading frantically in the permits and their derivatives.”

        Our bailout buddies over at Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and the other Wall Street behemoths are buying heavily into carbon trading (see this, this, this, this, this, this and this). As University of Maryland professor economics professor and former Chief Economist at the U.S. International Trade Commission Peter Morici writes:

            Obama must ensure that the banks use the trillions of dollars in federal bailout assistance to renegotiate mortgages and make new loans to worthy homebuyers and businesses. Obama must make certain that banks do not continue to squander federal largess by padding executive bonuses, acquiring other banks and pursuing new high-return, high-risk lines of businesses in merger activity, carbon trading and complex derivatives. Industry leaders like Citigroup have announced plans to move in those directions. Many of these bankers enjoyed influence in and contributed generously to the Obama campaign. Now it remains to be seen if a President Obama can stand up to these same bankers and persuade or compel them to act responsibly.

        In other words, the same companies that made billions off of derivatives and other scams and are now getting bailed out on your dime are going to make billions from carbon trading.

    One the largest boosters for cap and trade invented credit default swaps – which were supposed to increase financial stability, but instead were a large part of the reason that the world economy crashed last year

Jeanne Roberts provides an update at environmental website Celsius:

    The E.U. carbon emissions trading fraud is huge, but perhaps nothing compared to the potential for cheating that will become available in the United States once Waxman-Markey, or some similar scheme for reducing carbon emissions, emerges from the Senate to become law.

    ***

    As Bloomberg notes, a carbon trading market organized around derivatives (sometimes known as credit default swaps, or CDS) is “open to manipulation,” in the words of billionaire hedge fund investor George Soros.

    In fact, some old-school environmentalists see the whole carbon trading scheme as not a way to curb climate change, but merely a way to make the rich even richer at the expense of the rest of us. As Larry Lohmann, the founding member of the Durban Group for Climate Justice, says, “Dishonesty is rife throughout the carbon offset market.”

    In January, investigators from Belgium said that in some E.U. countries, 90 percent of the market volume in carbon trading was based on criminal activities."

Traffic shaping is left to the ISPs themselves to do if they see fit. Sky **do** traffic shape on their BT-based connections.

BTwholesale does not traffic shape. Things slow down when exchange contention happens, but that's more to do with BT's unwillingness to fix their network rather than network management. That affects BT's own retail customers just as it affects other ISPs.

As someone who is not on a BT-owned ISP but uses BTwholesale's ADSL network, I have not experienced traffic shaping - either by my ISP (who doesn't shape anyway) or by BT. I get problems with exchange contention but, once again, that isn't really traffic shaping. I can download at full speed whenever I want, which since I connect at the full 8Mbit is about 6.8Mbit after overhead. Can't complain with that. Certainly not ""&lt; 0.5Mb"" that you allege.

If you have proof of what BT is allegedly doing, send it to Ofcom and/or the EU authorities. They'd be very interested; since it is not something BTwholesale is allowed to do.

BT has already pretty much made the LLU operators reconsider their plans by rolling out fibre to the cabinet/home. Why put DSLAMs in exchanges when BT might suddenly make it obsolete with something better that you can pay to use instead?

&gt; Plus it's to discourage other phone providers from going the non-LLU route.

BT's charges for using their ADSL network (IPstream or WBC) are astronomical - with WBC being slightly less so. Why would BT want to actively stop people from paying them these astronomical sums of money - sums that are likely to be very profitable for them?

They'd rather people pay to use their network than go the LLU route which is more hassle and much less profitable for BT. Of course, regulation prevents them from doing this, so they can't do anything about it. But I fail to see your logic in that statement."

There are however a number of other points which must be kept in mind here. Yes, there was a significant portion of Jews who were expelled from Arab lands, but many left because they wanted to become part of the Jewish state, just as their European brethren left to become part of that state. It is unfair to claim that every Jew who left Arab lands was expelled while at the same time claiming all European/American/etc Jews left on their own accord. Logically, it makes no sense. For that reason I think that figure is grossly exaggerated. 

Secondly, the Palestinians were not responsible for any of what happened to those Jews who were expelled from other Arab countries, and the expulsion of those Jews had no bearing on the fate of the Palestinians. 

It was not a war of ethnic cleansing on all sides when the Palestinians were expelled - the expulsion of certain Jews was an unfortunate consequence of what happened to the Palestinians. The Palestinians were expelled to make room for a Jewish homeland, plain and simple. This is a fact that is nobody dares acknowledge these days, even though millions of Palestinians still live in refugee camps."

Cities that developed with any sort of order (ie urban planning) are often arranged in grid patterns, rather than the bric-a-brac layout of most places in Europe, where things developed organically over long periods with very little advance planning. 

Because many cities in North America incorporated tenets of modern-ish urban planning during their growth, the grid patterns are quite common. Often the grids are aligned to the cardinal direction, just because if you have to pick 4 directions to align to, why not N/E/S/W. Which means it's very easy to tell which direction is which, as the streets give you a basis to orient yourself to. 

As well, in many places, streets are divided in two along some central thoroughfare which marks the 'zero' address. For example, let's say ""Main Street"" was taken to be the middle of the town and runs North-South. On the west side of that street, street addresses would start at 100 \_\_\_ St W., increasing the further west you go, and to the east side of Main, the addresses would start at 100 \_\_\_ St E., increasing to the east.

... So, sometimes the cardinal directions are even part of the street name &amp; addresses.

In places where the grid is numbered, you can give people directions only by providing the street address. 5500 63rd St W in many places would mean ""55 blocks [a block = 1 grid road] West of the central thoroughfare on 63rd St"", which in places which have numbered streets for both directions of roads also usually means ""Near the corner of 63rd St and 55th Ave"" (where St's are West/East roads and Ave's are North/South roads).

Highways are also almost always signed based on their general cardinal direction, rather than listing a specific destination, which I think is more common in Europe. If you're in NYC and want to get on the Interstate to Washington DC, you don't look for the road to Washington, you look for the road heading South.

Cardinal navigation is also made easier in more mountainous terrain, which is more common in certain parts of North America. Here in Vancouver, it's always dead easy to tell which direction is North, because that's where the mountains are. "

This is the mirror-claim to the claim that Palestinians left because they wanted to make room for the Arab armies to cleanse the land from Jews.

&gt; It is unfair to claim that every Jew who left Arab lands was expelled while at the same time claiming all European/American/etc Jews left on their own accord.

I don't claim that they all were expelled. But a significant portion of them (many hundreds of thousands) were, see:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_exodus_from_Arab_and_Muslim_lands

&gt; Secondly, the Palestinians were not responsible for any of what happened to those Jews who were expelled from other Arab countries, and the expulsion of those Jews had no bearing on the fate of the Palestinians.

I don't claim that they were responsible. I am just trying to give some context, a broader picture so people have a more balanced view of the situation.

The situation is usually portrayed in a very narrow view that focuses on Israeli wrongs and barely mentions, if at all, the symmetry of the situation and the wrongs on the other side.  This, of course, infuriates people against Israel which was, back then, playing by the ""rules of the game"", as it was in 1947-1948.

&gt; the expulsion of certain Jews was an unfortunate consequence of what happened to the Palestinians. 

Why do you say that?

&gt; The Palestinians were expelled to make room for a Jewish homeland, plain and simple. This is a fact that is nobody dares acknowledge these days, even though millions of Palestinians still live in refugee camps.

I think it was acknowledged even then, and is acknowledged by many now.  The fact they *still* are in refugee camps, and do not get granted equal status where-ever they are is a testament to the awful treatment they are getting by surrounding Arab countries.

In the initial return to the area designated as Israel, the Arab's living there at the time were first very welcoming, but then felt threatened after a mass immigration of Jews began to come to Israel.  Arab countries urged the Arab's living in Israel to leave their homes because they were confident the Jew's would be defeated.

Oil reserves in Libya are the largest in Africa and the ninth largest in the world with 41.5 billion barrels (6.60×109 m3) as of 2007.

Libya is considered a highly attractive oil area due to its low cost of oil production (as low as $1 per barrel at some fields), and proximity to European markets. Libya would like to increase production from 1.8 Mbbl/d (290×103 m3/d) in 2006 to 3 Mbbl/d (480×103 m3/d) by 2010–13 but with existing oil fields undergoing a 7–8% decline rate, Libya's challenge is maintaining production at mature fields, while finding and developing new oil fields.

$30 a night for a hostel room, $10 a day for cheap food, and about $6 a day for tickets/admission to museums, etc. You'll also need $4-6 a day for public transit but you can buy weekly cards in some cities that may make it cheaper.

I don't litter though because although my personal impact would be small, it is still *an* impact and contributes to the overall problem.

I don't think Australia's action will encourage other countries to change.  What I do think will happen is that other countries with a conscience will instigate similar policies regardless of what we do.  The EU has started and hopefully the USA will come along at some point.  As the effects of climate change become more pronounced I imagine their policies will become more strict.  If we are not already well down the path of reducing emissions, I imagine that our industries and services will be uncompetitive in carbon conscious world."

A resume is a personal thing (obviously) so I'll tell you what *I* prefer but ultimately it's up to you to represent yourself. I'm coming from an engineering background but I imagine this should apply most places:

* Your resume should roughly represent a bulleted list of things you have made or did, not a biography or ad copy. Optimize for space.
* Put your name, mailing address, phone number, and e-mail address at the top in some unobtrusive manner. If you are applying for a job with specific citizenship requirements, (I.E., a national security job which requires US citizenship) you may want to mention that somewhere.
* Avoid a 'statement of purpose.' Some resume counselors love these things but I think they waste space and don't tell you much about the candidate. An exception is if you're trying to find a job doing something different; if someone has a largely academic background but puts 'looking for a job in industry' this signals something that might not be obvious otherwise.
* The writing cliche 'show, don't tell' applies to resumes. 'Dedicated, passionate individual' is meaningless fluff. Everyone is passionate. 'Spent a year in Germany studying German' tells me something: you were passionate and dedicated enough *to live in another country for a year*.
* Don't sell yourself short. If you feel that something you've done doesn't directly apply to a job you might be applying for, don't be afraid to list it somewhere. A 'misc' section at the bottom is a great place to put these. Also, the things you are most proud of (or are the coolest to talk about) should get the most space.
* Resumes serve two purposes: to see if you fit the job description and *to see if you are an interesting person to talk to*. A lot of people read resumes by scanning for keywords and highlighting them *so they can ask you about it*. Like someone buying a funny shirt hoping strangers will ask him about it, pick your best experiences and slap down as many interesting hook phrases you can about them.
* If you are in or have graduated from college, avoid putting anything about high school in your resume. If you did something really exceptional (represented the US in a soccer match in Europe at 16), put it in a misc thing at the bottom. This is really hard for freshman to do, the best thing I can say is try to write about your hobbies as much as you can. Don't put SAT scores on a resume. Just don't.

If you have some job experience, separate out academic and job stuff. If you don't, it's OK to weave 'club officer' things along with actual jobs.

Here is a little template for your job experience. One per job! There is a little intro blurb where you talk about the job description and the company (as if anyone had done it, not just you) and then a set of bullet points of what you did (and sometimes why that was important).

...

So, before the founding of the United States of America, there was a collection of colonies without a national identity.  Europeans had come to geographically refer to their New World as America, all because [Amerigo Vespucci](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amerigo_vespucci) kind of Edisoned his way into history.  

See, Amerigo was a banker for the House of Medici, and specifically worked with Giovanni de' Medici (better known as [Pope Leo X](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Leo_X), the last non-priest to be Poped), so his reputation climbed in the early 16th century by simply being in the shiny halo of the Medicis.  Columbus, meanwhile, was never the hero this new land deserved, or ever really needed. His brutal governing of the people of Hispaniola was not ignored in his time (he was shackled, jailed and sailed back to Spain, only to be pardoned by the King).  His reputation was never anything great, and any honor his name gained through discovery was tarnished by his governance. So, in 1507, a year after Columbus's death, Martin Waldseemüller published [The Universal Cosmography according to the Tradition of Ptolemy and the Voyages of Amerigo Vespucci and others](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Waldseemuller_map_2.jpg), the first map to bear the name *America*.  Later, as the British Empire rose to power, they tried use the discoveries of their man, Giovanni Caboto, to outshine those that sailed for Spain (even Anglicizing his name to John Cabot).

Spam Forward ~250 Years, and we have an emerging nation directly in opposition to England. In looking for a name, they consider their origins, so the only new term that finds any real traction is *Columbia* (as it had been colloquially tossed around for the past 50 years or so). Staying true to making declarations of being rather than inventions of new entities, the only real option was to invoke the geographic name already commonly held. Columbia, however, lived on through cities, streets, poems and songs.  Eventually being visualized as a poetic feminine representation of the ideals of America, becoming known as the [Goddess of Liberty](http://books.google.com/books?id=WE4DAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22columbia%22%20goddess%20liberty&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q=%22columbia%22%20goddess%20liberty&amp;f=false), and placed on [coinage](http://books.google.com/books?id=YekXAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22columbia%22%20goddess%20liberty&amp;pg=PA98#v=onepage&amp;q=%22columbia%22%20goddess%20liberty&amp;f=false) (originally by [Paul Revere](http://books.google.com/books?id=GuoRAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22columbia%22%20goddess%20liberty&amp;pg=PA594#v=onepage&amp;q=%22paul%20revere%22&amp;f=false)). 300 years after Columbus's discovery, America's new federal capital was to to be named the District of Columbia, not directly in his honor, but rather, referencing its responsibility to and its existence in the ideals of the people.

Over the next 50 years, America finds its footing, and begins to define its core official visual vocabulary (Eagle, Stars and Stripes, Red, White and Blue, Neoclassical influences on Art, Architecture, and Design etc.).  Meanwhile, the French had themselves some Revolutions, Napoleon went all Alexander on the Old World, and the romantic feminine symbols of French Liberty and Reason eventually became singularly recognized as [Marianne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne).  In 1830, Eugene Delacroix painted [Liberty Leading the People](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Leading_the_People), which would go on to influence [Frederic Bartholdi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Bartholdi) when working on the French gift to America,  [Liberty Enlightening the World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Enlightening_the_World).  

Now, when a nation gives a nation a gift, ambiguity of the influences can be positive, in the sense that it allows the receiving nation the opportunity to adopt it and define it in its own image. Liberty Enlightening the World is such a case, whereas the Neoclassic influence of Liberty from the original Republic of Rome, was obvious and appropriate.  But this representation did not belong to history, it belonged to America, and as Marianne had come to represent Liberty, Reason, France as a nation and all of its virtues, Columbia was becoming a representation of Liberty, Freedom, Justice, America and its virtues.

However, much of Marianne's recognition as an icon is due to a French Revolution mentality of casting off the shackles of male domination, and embracing Reason over Religion.  America dealt with these issues much more diversely as it was twice as populous and 4 or 5 times as geographically sprawled in the middle of the 19th century (not to mention the Civil War enveloping the entire nation).  In 1892, the 400th anniversary of Columbus's discovery, America proved itself more interested in literal honors than metaphorical ones by declaring the first Columbus Day (just 6 years after the Statue of Liberty had been dedicated), and introducing the first Pledge of Allegiance.  So, Columbia never became the complete icon for America.  Instead, Justice, Liberty, and Freedom retained unique identities. 

All languages, including visual, are ever evolving, and every culture establishes its own dialect.  To expect allegorical symbols to be reduced to absolute answers is to misunderstand the nature of myth and poetry.  I never meant to imply you were incorrect, only that there is more to the metaphor.


...


TL;DR  Columbia IS Liberty, in an early American visual dialect.  Liberty IS NOT Columbia, universally."

They don't do this in America? Whoah...

Edit: something more about languages. In Flanders they never dub English. Only subtitles. If something that was originally English is dubbed then it is most likely just for children.

Could Cap and Trade Cause Another Market Meltdown?

http://www.crimeandfederalism.com/2010/06/summary-of-capandtrade-legislation.html

Banks like JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs already have active carbon trading desks that deal in instruments connected to Europe's cap-and-trade system and voluntary markets here. But business will explode if a cap-and-trade system becomes law. So it's no surprise that the financial industry has taken an intense interest in the fine print of the Waxman-Markey bill. According to data compiled by the Center for Public Integrity, the financial services industry has 130 lobbyists working on climate issues, compared to almost none in 2003. They represent companies like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and AIG (before it was shamed into temporarily halting its lobbying activities last fall).

The fact is that Italians did not contribute to organized crime in American in any proportion higher than any other ethnic group including Jews, the Irish, blacks or Protestant Caucasians. But the Italians' contribution to organized crime was simply more publicized and sensationalized because they were easily identifiable and had more difficulty assimilating than other lighter skinned Western European immigrants. And once America became comfortable with the archetype of the Italian gangster, it was only a matter of time before it became mythicized in popular culture until finally law students speak matter of factly about the causal relationship between Italian culture and Italian-American criminals.

However economists agree that the main driver for improved working conditions is rising per capita productivity. As technology and specialization of labor have increased with time, each individual worker has been able to produce more valuable products. This allows total wages to rise, and working conditions are a part of total wages.

The oft-criticized industrial revolution, then, produced the greatest increase in working conditions in human history. In the late 1800's, millions of people across America and Western Europe _voluntarily_ left their farms to go work in factories because, despite the huge drawbacks, factories afforded them better conditions and a higher and more reliable salary than subsistence agrarianism. Then as the revolution continued with the invention of the moving assembly line, the transistor, and then finally the computer, working conditions continued to improve.

See further info in the Baldy Harper essay to which I linked.

But, since you asked: I don't know a whole lot about the labor laws of Hong Kong, but I do know that they are considered the most capitalist place on Earth, and that up until 2010 they had never had any minimum wage law at all. From what I hear, it's a decent place with fairly happy people."

&gt;the product does not contain levels of the radionuclides 
iodine-131, caesium-134 and caesium-137 above the 
maximum levels provided for in Council Regulation

Now however when it comes to testing items from Japan, at least 20% of all items from outside the affected area must be physically tested and tested for the radioactive material, oddly(in my mind) the regulation only requires a testing of at least 10% from the affected region.

Finally it defines non compliant items as those exceeding

&gt; It has existed since at least 450BC.


The Romans made up the term ""Palestina""when they conquered the area, about 135, following the fall of a Jewish revolt led by Bar Kokhba in 132–135. They imposed that term on it because it was linguistically similar to ""Plishtim"", the Philistines (who came from the Greek area) - a long-standing historic enemy of the Israelites. The Philistines are not the antecedents of the people currently known as Palestinians (before 1948 - the only people known by that term were the Jews of the land mass). There is no ""P"" sound in the Arabic language. ""P"" is usually pronounced as ""F"" (""Palestine"" is pronounced as ""Falestine""). At the end of a word, the usual sound is ""B"" ('Zip"" is pronounced 'Zib'.)

""The name Palestine, which the Romans had bestowed on the conquered and subjugated land of Judaea, had been retained for a time by the Arab conquerors to designate an administrative subdivision of their Syrian province. But that name had disappeared in the country even before the arrival of the Crusaders nine centuries ago. It had returned in Europe with the revival of classical learning at the time of the Renaissance, and was commonly applied by European Christians to what they had previously called the Holy Land, By the early twentieth century, with the predominance of European influence and with it of the European language of discourse, the name Palestine came to be used even in the country. This use was, however, in the main confined to Christians and to a very small group of westernized Muslims. The name was not used officially, and had no precise territorial definition until it was adopted by the British to designate the area which they acquired by conquest at the end of World War I and ruled under mandate form the League of Nations.” Bernard Lewis (*Semites and Anti-Semitism*)

This is true if you accept that most animals are self-aware. Pain/suffering is only an allowable /or for self-aware beings. Nociception(pain) is a physiological mechanism that can be found way down the ""intelligence"" ladder, since we can find the specific receptor cells and nervous pathways in species' anatomy. It works as a stimulus that is triggered by damaging conditions and ""encourages"" a response to stop them. It is entirely reasonable to assume pain is felt by animals that are not self-aware, judging by their responses to harm.

Suffering is trickier, and is loosely defined in this instance as the understanding of coming to harm. Knowing an alligator is trying to tear your arm off is worse than feeling intense, anonymous pain in your arm. It is reasonable with our current knowledge of neurology to assume animals that are not self-aware do not feel this, as they have no concept of their own bodies. Anthropomorphizing fish coming to terms with impending death and panicking is wrong with current theory. We know dogs don't have short term memory like we do, but can't say for sure whether they cower from an abusive owner through fear or as a computational function to minimize threat and avoid damage. It sounds callous but we do try and minimize these situations in the mean time. 

As with all these things however, when we do eventually find out more, it's more than likely going to be a sliding scale, with even more moral tangles than before. This means your stance is probably the ""most"" right.

Okay sorry, Abdul Aziz was a pretty sweet guy he just had to use the extreme of Wahabism to get the rest of Saudi Arabia behind him, and it pretty much claimed if you do not get behind me then I will behead you.  This of course was under the protection of the British naval fleet.

Fast forward to 1917 and Americo discovered oilwell #7,  Abdul Aziz looking for the highest bidder was looking at lucrative licencing rights.  Britain showed up with a super fancy car, Roosevelt gave Abdul Aziz his wheelchair.  

This is in no way accurate but close and it happened only 60-70 years ago.  These are deals that took years to come to fruition and shaped the world for the next 100 years.  The deals we are making now will have the same effect and are just as baffling to those that make them as to us simple peasant folk that have to live with them.

Early-on, I started to wonder how well-grounded this author's view on relevant history and social context was, and by the end it seems to break down completely

For instance:
&gt;The Hispanic desire to be part of America at a civic level is evident in the huge recruitment rates of Hispanics in the US military.

That's a very *special* way of interpreting that statistic. I would venture that this is more representative of the increased recruitment of those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, but he intends to argue that it demonstrates how ethnic integration in the US is *different* from Europe because immigrants want to integrate to American society.

Which leads us to one of the highly contestable (probably just flat-out wrong) ideas in his essay: that ethnic integration in the US was successful and smooth because multiculturalism was not practiced. Firstly, the cultural clashes that Europe and Australia claim to be experiencing from immigration are nothing foreign to US history. Immigration in the US has always met resistance on social, cultural, and racial levels. Think about the experiences of the first Irish immigrants, *50 freakin years of Chinese exclusion*, Japanese internment, issues with Hmong ethnic societies forming in the US, Filipino treatment in the US, and modern reaction to Mexican immigration, and so on. Have we forgotten history so readily? There is nothing unique about Europe's integration issues.

It seems more sound to say that if there is successful integration in the US and not Europe, it's because the US has been doing it longer.

He even goes on to rather explicitly echo the Model Minority Myth (one of the most subtle and deeply racist notions prevailing in society today), and also attributes things like 
&gt;violence and misogyny, drugs and gang and ethnic conflict

to multiculturalism, when I would rather think those are tell-tale signs of poverty. 

Finally we get to the part where he backs-up the claims that his society is declining as a result of this mixing, which is incidentally where it really starts to fall apart.

&gt;I wandered into the Muslim bookshop. I was astounded to see titles such as The International Jew or The Truth about the Pope, amid a welter of anti-Semitic, anti-Christian and pro-extremist literature.

And when I wander into a Fox News store, I am astounded to see Glenn Beck's books lining the shelves. This doesn't make it a nucleus of cultural secession.

&gt;The advent of satellite television made it easier for these folks to live a life apart. Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV station was available on satellite packages. Most Arab homes you went into had Arabic TV playing in the background. The anti-social behaviour became more acute.

Maintaining ties to your own culture is anti-social? This guy begins to echo the worst aspects of the Model Minority Myth-- that you are only desirable if you strive to be like the white majority.

And this guy is walking around immigrant peoples' houses? Am I still supposed to take this as reality or is it becoming a work of fiction?"

Even if you worked out for three hours a day every day you could gain weight by drinking a bottle of coke after the exercize

According to MSNBC only 30% of people of European descent have the gene, and that the gene's effects *can* be controlled with sufficient moderate exercise.  The quoted study actually suggests less exercise than you claim, at only 3-4 hours of *moderate exercise* (walking, stairs, etc.) is sufficient in combating the fat gene.

As for the other 70% of white people, drinking a coke after exercising at a gym for thee hours a day would have little to no effect, and would certainly not cause them to gain weight.

I believe a can of coke has 160 calories in it (correct me if I'm wrong), 3000 calories = 1lb of fat.  If someone is working out in a gym they can burn anywhere from 150-800 calories per hour, depending on their physical exertion. 

 At 300 calories per hour, for three hours, thats 900 calories burnt.  900 calories burnt 5 times per week is 4500 calories, which is 1.5lbs of fat.  Drinking one can of coke after exercising every day is an addition of what, 7.5 grams of fat (possibly less, I forget) and 800 calories, with a total weekly calorie deficit being 3600 calories per week and over 1 pound of fat.

If you add in a reduced-calorie intake for the purpose of controlling weight - you most certainly can and will lose weight doing so.  I have lost over 100 pounds in a year doing this."

As for the 2003 war. It totally and utterly made me sick when I saw that coundown in 2003 on tv and then the bombs started falling. I think it was handling completely wrong. Obviously now most people agree that they were fed lies and it turned out to be a very bad decision. The whole war on terror which led to the rise of the calling for an Iraq War was totally misused in my opinion. Iraq did not have ties to terrorism abroad, and many other countries deserved the scrutiny Iraq was recieving. 

Right now, I am most worried about Iraq being goverened  by extremist's who will try to turn Iraq into an islamic state. I personally enjoyed the level of secularism under Saddam's regime.

I was actually born during the Gulf War (1991) and so all the information I have about it is from what I've read, documentaries I've seen, and talking to my family. Obviously an invasion of another country isn't okay. From what I've seen, it wasn't made clear to Saddam that the international community would react violently to his actions, and in particular by the US which I think gave him false hope. I admit, it's hard not to feel some national pride of not letting other countries push you around, but I do understand the UN did what it had to do. As for the reasons the war started, I can understand why Iraq would be furious if Kuwait had been tapping into Iraqi reserves, or if they had been purposely diluting oil prices but the reasons have been disputed so I shouldn't be commenting on that since I don't know the exact situtation that caused the invasion. 

During that period, when I was still a newborn baby, all of the people from the nothern region of Iraq were fleeing either to Turkey or Iran because of the fighting taking place between Saddam and the Kurds. I've heard terrible stories from my mother nursing me in a car with items under her feet, my sister on one side of her and a couple other small children crammed on her other side in a tiny car with me in her arms to stories about kurdish families tossing their newborns off cliffs in fear that the army would hear the child crying, to many of the other newborns dying because their mothers fed them formula made with unclean water. 

My dad was left in Kuwait after the army retreated and was forced to find his own way home. 

What really crippled Iraq were the sanctions imposed after the gulf war. They really made rebuilding after the two previous wars impossible. Way of life in Iraq prior to the Iran-Iraq war had been relatively good. The people had money, I heard stories about how the Dinar was stronger than most world currencies. People would go to tour Europe all the time. In fact, Saddam had actually focused on building hospitals and schools before the wars began. If I could change one thing, I think it would have been the sanctions. "

The Celts leave us no lasting legacy in the arts, math and science.  In everything that has come down to us - coinage, statues, and civil engineering - the Romans matched or exceeded the Celts.  Militarily, the Celts were apparently no match for Roman military engineering, weapon production, and social order.  In other words, the Celts were nothing special as a compelling counter-narrative; there are at least a half-dozen other ancient civilizations with a claim to comparable sophistication.

The Romans were brutal, but they were also cosmopolitan, successful, and obsessed with practical engineering and a stable social order.  Perhaps most importantly, they had an eye to the future informed by their unique sense of their own *dignitas* and *auctoritas*.  They kept records, standardized, and generally set the tone that drives western civilization long after the last legions stopped marching.

Perhaps the Celts might have been better ""custodians of Europe"", but I suspect that the unusual length of the Roman era (being as it is an outlier in history) would have been difficult to improve on.  Further, I can't imagine a scenario in which the Celts could have superseded Rome without resorting to Roman-style brutality.

The Celts are fascinating in their own right, but I fear you're overstating your case much in the way that those who talk about the ""advanced"" Native American tribes often do.  Nobody is suggesting that theses were cavemen."

 The Quran is absolutely meant to be taken literally. It is supposed to be the complete infallible, unchanged word of God and therefore everything stated in the quran is literally supposed to be taken as fact. This doesn't prevent some schools of Islamic thought on interpreting some passages figuratively in order to reconcile their beliefs, however the majority of muslims take the Quran as it is, completely literal.

Abrogation is acknowledged even in the quran itself. For example early on in Muhammads career when he was trying to gain acceptance from the Makkans there were many verses about being peaceful towards other religions and freedom of speech. Later on, when he was commanding armies and had a huge following he ordered the killing of unbelievers wherever you may find them or something to that effect. Most muslims obviously don't slay unbelievers wherever they find them but nevertheless, in the true spirit of Islam, the later verses would supersede the earlier ones.

Striving to spread Islam is a religious duty. All muslims will generally agree that Sharia law is supposed to be the most perfect, best legal system ever developed anywhere. So enforcing sharia law would be a duty by association. In the UK muslims have taken matters into their own hands and issue verdicts from sharia courts all over the country.

AFAIK the Quran does not specifically mention other political systems, however it does imply that Islam should be the only basis for governing laws. Free speech is not encouraged because as a muslim you are supposed to submit to the authority - Allah.

Attempting to institue sharia in European countries does not suprise me in the slightest. Google it if you're really interested man.

I do not think Islam considers other forms of government as sin, there are rules concerning the conduct of muslims when the government is not Islamic based, however as always they consider sharia to be better.

Yes. It is the duty of all muslims to keep striving towards their ultimate goal, which is making the whole world muslim.

I have never heard of this before. It's possible that deception was encouraged to convert people, but this a completely new concept to me. I was never taught this would be acceptable.

All non-muslims are pretty much enemies of Islam. Islam has a very strong us vs them mentality. If you do not conform to Islamic way, you are pretty much considered an enemy.

Cannot comment on the Islamic relief agency because I don't know, but it wouldn't suprise me.

Part of me thinks that imitating some of the models of the social democracies in Europe would be a good start, but while they're certainly capable of besting other modern models based on most metrics, they're not without their faults. I'll try and list three central things that I consider paramount to a hypothetical 'reboot':

I think the most important thing for everyone to agree on right up front is how  free trade can't work without fair trade. Current free trade models are extremely profitable for multinationals, but are ultimately detrimental on the whole because of the exploitation of workers, resources, and the environment in countries without forms of protection in place. This is where fair trade comes in: countries should not be able to trade freely with countries that do not have similar worker, resource, and environmental protections in place, that way the best product or service, not the most exploitive, is rewarded by the market. What's happening now is that companies that use ultra-cheap labor, extract resources from countries unable to regulate said extraction, and other exploitive practices are being rewarded like crazy. Did you know that companies are dumping radioactive waste off the shores of Somalia? That's because Somalia lacks the infrastructure to monitor and police dumping. Did you know that, according to UNICEF, approximately 8% of children in Bangladesh between the ages of 5 and 14 are involved in child labor? Slavery is still rampant. Among the fruits of this labor are rice and wheat, textiles, and coal, much of which makes its way to China, Europe and the United States. 

In addition, I think it's absolutely paramount to have basic international environmental standards, rules which everyone is compelled to follow by an independent organization with extensive investigative and punitive abilities. These don't need to be environmental utopia-level regulations, but basic rules in place to prevent human extinction, such as greenhouse gas emission limitations, regulated resource extraction (like, say, deep-sea drilling), and other basic needs which cannot be left to countries to decide on. The simple reason for this is that totally autonomous, independent nations can fall victim to the irresponsibility of other totally autonomous, independent nations even if they do everything right environmentally. America fucks up the Gulf and now fishermen from all over the Caribbean are suffering for it, not to mention we have no clue what the ultimate effect of Corexit will be. While libertarians fight me tooth and nail of international environmental protections, no argument exists to actually prove me wrong. Seriously, try it. 

Finally, humanism, not religiosity, should be the central unifying cause of societies. Of course there should be freedom of religion, and people should be allowed to worship who(m) they wish in whatever way they want so long as they're not infringing on the personal rights of others, but the ultimate driving vision of a people should not be supernatural/mythological/fictitious in nature. When superstition and myth govern, the people inevitably suffer. When we keep a clear head, objective, skeptical, and honest, things tend to go better. "

That's a distance of LA to Denver, roughly, which yeah, even I'd fly. But like you said, travel to cities like Stockholm which are fairly frequent, is roughly the same distance as LA to SF and would use even faster trains if this line was built.

Plus, from my experience, long distance travel by rail over Europe was often delayed because of too many stops/transfers on the way. The Copenhagen to Paris example would probably require a transfer in Amsterdam, Hamburg, Brussels, or if you got unlucky, some combination of them. The LA to SF line would be extremely dedicated, I imagine, and I'd expect daily, nonstop options.

I understand your point about self-awareness, and it makes sense that non-self-aware animals won't be thinking about the damage to their body if they get attacked by an alligator. But it doesn't make sense to me that you say understanding you're being hurt is worse than actually being hurt.

Removing pain from the issue for a moment, the question seems to be this: which is more wrong, to make someone believe that you're going to damage them, or to actually damage someone. Doing actual damage to someone seems like it's infinitely more hurtful or wrong. Perhaps fear of being hurt adds to the pain, but I don't think it's what we should judge an action's morality on.

I think the kind of suffering you're referring to is, as stated on Wikipedia, ""mental or emotional pain,"" also spoken of as ""psychological pain."" I agree that animals that are not self-aware are probably unable to experience most psychological pain, although obviously we need to keep studying this. But while inflicting psychological pain is horrible and should be avoided, inflicting physical pain is just as bad and probably worse. We first-world humans don't experience intense physical pain very often anymore, so I think we may have romanticized psychological pain as the worst thing in the world.

If psychological pain is removed from an issue dealing with human pain, you're left with something like intense physical torture with a guarantee of release and no lasting physical damage. This scenario is still complete hell, even though you know you'll be fine when it's all over and that it'll be over at some point. And anyone who inflicts this on others is doing serious wrong.

Animals are completely capable of suffering this exact scenario, and if we believe causing physical pain is wrong, then the sheer amount of pain caused to animals in factory farms is unbearable. Is it possible to consider the benefits we get from eating meat (some extra protein and the pleasure of a nice meal) worth the cost of the intense pain at the factory farms?

Then again, I'm in America, and our meat/animal cruelty laws are pretty despicable, I've heard that they're better in some of Europe. When I did eat meat, I made sure it was organic every time, and I still make sure to get organic eggs, milk, and cheese when possible.

There are other problems with eating meat, though, even if pain isn't considered; are the lives of all those animals really worth less than the pleasure that a bunch of humans get? Animal production for food also uses far, far more energy input to create the same amount of calories as plant production for food, animal farming releases methane into the atmosphere instead of and factory farming produces a huge number of toxic chemicals. Historically, eating meat has been something of a necessity. But with the rise of powerful agriculture and research about what makes a healthy vegetarian diet, it's not anymore. We can live perfectly healthy, happy lives without causing any pain or killing anything more sentient than a cornstalk. It's more than plausible that we as a species can be completely ethical about this. And more and more people are. http://www.prweb.com/releases/2007/10/prweb565023.htm

""That’s why the first Liberal budget would be heavily focused on a family pack plan, Mr. Ignatieff said, $500-million for early childhood learning, a $190-million increase for employment insurance benefits for family caregivers and $545-million for a family care tax benefit."" 

""...increasing the corporate tax rate by 1.5%, to a level of 18%, and another $300-million by eliminating a tax break on stock options for the very rich.""

""The party would end the accelerated capital cost allowance for oilsands development and reinvest the $265-million into technologies to reduce the oilsands impact on the environment.

The Liberals also pledged to create a cap-and-trade system, such as the one that already exists in Europe.

The party would boost spending on aboriginal education and language training and pledged $40-million for a veterans learning benefit.

The Liberals would also: restore the court challenges program; spend $100-million for a freshwater strategy; and reallocate $1-billion in funding, after the Afghan mission ends, to increase development aid and Canada’s participation in UN missions.""

And taxes/fees will still cost a bit regardless of whether you can get the tickets with your FF miles. I think RTW tickets are most cost effective if you have 6+ months and can use the local flights they include with the packages.

Maybe not the advice you're looking for - but have you considered only going to one of those destinations? 2 months split over 3 continents won't give you time to experience much. In my opinion 2 months in SE Asia, Australia, or a country or two in SA would be awesome, and would scratch the itch just fine. 

Any experienced travel fiend will tell you that less travel is more. Otherwise you're running around from tourist trap to tourist trap to major city to airport and not really getting as much out of the experience as you would staying in the same area for a while. My 2 cents anyway...

Edit: One thing I remember from my oneworld research a while ago is that it's cheaper for someone in North America to fly to Europe and book the ticket there. Something about how they calculate the zones/cost. You might want to look into that...not sure if they've closed that loophole, it's been a year since I looked into it."

And I'm not even that far away, I'm from Paris. I have seen everyone leave London, some in not such a great mental state, and I was one of the ones who stayed the longest, 6 years. In me and my friends' opinion, the London that is sold to the rest of the world is no longer a reality, it's the fun swinging London of the 60s, 70s. Although I have wonderful things to say about the place, it is today a financial center where city bankers thrive and the rest feed on their scraps. It is also the place where the 'lost kids' of Europe go to become hipsters because they have no goal in life other than the party (worth pointing out that I'm 25 in case you're thinking I'm an old lady ;); and these people unfortunately always end up being your flatmates somewhere. Then of course there's the insane costs of anything, from sandwiches to rent, especially in comparison to salaries. Oh and the permanently, cold, humid, overcast, spitting weather-And I mean permanent. New York gets freezing/scorching but at least you get to see some blue skies... Try 6 years without sunshine.
Then there's the art scene of course (I studied art in London and have worked in that field my whole life like the rest of my family) which is repugnantly stagnant, arrogant and stuck-up. Oh and the fact that as mixed as London is, people from different backgrounds really don't mix. I've lived in many places, none were class was such a dividing factor.

A. if it is decent katana it will stay sharper longer, the Japanese method of folding steel more than a few times often leaves steel sharper and wil have a better cut for a longer period of time 




B. this reason I feel is more important as you can always sharpen blades: I would say that the katana is better because not only is is two handed but it will also be quite a bit lighter.  This will significantly improve your accuracy, and assuming we are dealing with classic zombies here, you need to dismember the brain. Using the one handed European sword you will likely miss the neck or head the first couple blows and will need to raise the sword again in time.

I haven't experienced everything has to offer and I do have quite an extensive bucket list, BUT I'm content with what I've experienced so far and know that there is much more to come.. The exciting part about life is that I know that at this moment I can't even iMAGiNE what I'm going to experience. Years from now I could be doing HUGE things. Who knows, I may even be living in Europe and enjoying weekends swimming in the Mediterranean Sea. 

I take every opportunity there is to try something new- and because of that I have more hobbies than I can count. I love the thrill of never knowing what is going to happen next, but knowing that whatever it is, I will be happy.

I'm really glad to hear that you are finding the true meaning of life. Lists of things to do and sights to see are great because they always give you something to look forward to. Definitely go to Italy. If you have a chance, study abroad for a semester. Spending time in another country transforms you and you will come back with a totally different outlook on life. Europe in general is more laid back. They focus on ACTUALLY living, as opposed to whatever it is they call life in America and other countries that are gradually becoming Americanized. You get midday naps and long breaks for lunch AND people are actually friendly (with the exception of the French I encountered).

I have friends from Italy, Spain, and Germany. They take their time and the university students don't seem as stressed about finding a job as most Americans. I feel like they just take life as it comes and enjoy it. 

As for my bucket list: cross country road trip, landing an international job, going back to school to get a teacher license, becoming a teacher by the time I have kids (so I can raise them myself as opposed to through daycare), traveling to a couple Scandinavia countries, Italy, Japan, and Hawaii, and being the typical female... buying a really nice house and having a fabulous garden and interior decor. 

That is just the bigger picture though.. I have mental lists of things I do everyday. I walk outside and admire nature.. I pay attention to the texture of the bark of the tree, I look at how the leaves seem to suspend in air, I wonder how it is that flowers do absolutely nothing extra to look so pretty, yet humans feel the need to chance something about themselves in order to look beautiful... I also try to look at things through the eyes of a child. Adults become so accustomed to routines that they don't find excitement in everyday life. Can you remember how excited you were as a child to do the silliest things? I remember things such as soda and candy being a treat. I was obsessed with root beer.. every time I was allowed to drink it I felt like I was the luckiest girl on earth. No way your average adult would get excited to drink root beer..  When I went out to dinner the other day I allowed myself to think how exciting that would have been for me as a child. Most people would call this weird and say that root beer isn't that exciting, but that is because they look at things through the same eyes every day. A child (or a very smart adult) sees the world differently on a daily basis. They wash away their old judgments and preconceptions every night as they go to bed and look at everything as if it were the first time. 

I'll leave you with a quick story. During a car trip to the playground with a 7-year old I was babysitting, the lil one squealed in his super happy voice, ""GUESS WHAT I TALKED ABOUT WITH MY FRIEND THE OTHER DAY?!?!"" Judging by his level of excitement I predicted this was gonna be an epic story....... Boy: ""We talked about MPH!!"".. Me: ""Oh yeah? What is MPH?"" Boy: ""Miles per hour!!!!!"" *large smile on face.. Me: ""Yes! You're right! Do you know what that is?"" Boy: ""Nope! but it sounds pretty cool, right.""   HAHAHA at this point, I too had a HUGE smile on my face. He was SO proud of himself for knowing and SO happy. I couldn't help but smile. Not to mention it was ADORABLE, but it just goes to show you why children are happier than adults. They find happiness in the little things. It doesn't have to be that way. Realization is the first step. :)"

&gt; You obviously have a strong background in the history of philosophy.

It's new philosophy I'm still learning. Pretty fascinating stuff. I have a background in biology and now I'm in the health sciences. My reading of philosophy's just done in my spare time over the years.

&gt; I've always been curious about the history of Aristotle's ideas through this period. It seems like there are a few similarities between the Arab/Islamic world and Christian/European one. Al Ghazali, reminds me very much of Augustine.

Aristotle's epistemology was really preserved via Islamic civilization and then picked up again in the West. Al-Ghazali functioned in a role more similar to David Hume in that regard, because in the West Hume/Kant upended rationalism in favor of Kant's Idealism (I still don't know what Hume was trying to peddle other than spoil everyone's fun). Al-Ghazali took down old rationalism in favor of the orthodox Islamic theology where God controls causality."

Irish pubs aswell are anything but pretentious, I go to them quite a bit, generally they have a better pint of Guinness! They're not in there listening to Shostakovich drinking Mojitos, everything about them tends to be pretty rustic.

I find the old ""arms"" pubs much more pretentious. The Al Murray, landlord/guvnor, crested jackets, discussing hunting and midsomer murders, operating a BNP meeting in the basement every second Sunday (while we are generalizing!).

Also, since the oldest bar in Europe is in Ireland, Sean's Bar in Athlone, you might Irish pubs are the standard, although thats open to debate!

Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, the Palestinian Mandate, as ratified by the LoN, September 29th 1923, recognising Palestine as an independent under mandate.
Articles 5 and 7 of the Mandate directly state that no Palestinian territory should be conceded and that Palestinian citizenship is recognised.

Like most other peoples today called Arabs, the Palestinians descend from the pre-existing ancient inhabitants of their respective region and those who have come to settle it throughout history; a matter on which genetic studies have proven.

Much of the local Palestinian population in Nablus is believed to be descended from Samaritans who converted to Islam. Even today, certain Nabulsi surnames including Muslimani, Yaish, and Shakshir among others, are associated with a Samaritan origin.

&gt;the Jordanians made everyone in the West Bank citizens meaning that all the Arabs living there became Jordanian

Hmm, so by your logic, European Jews have no right to any land in the middle east.

* Claim that the Arabs are ""evil"" for not giving Palestinians citizenships
* then claim that they Palestinians have no rights to the land because they have citizenships from other countries.

The native population that has been living there for thousands of years. I'll tell you who's land its NOT, its not Europeans. In fact, when European Jews came to Palestine they kicked off many of the Palestinians Jews and saw them as squatters.
Throughout history a great diversity of peoples has moved into the region and made Palestine their homeland: Canaanites, Jebusites, Philistines from Crete, Anatolian and Lydian Greeks, Hebrews, Amorites, Edomites, Nabateans, Arameans, Romans, Arabs, and European crusaders, to name a few. Each of them appropriated different regions that overlapped in time and competed for sovereignty and land. Others, such as Ancient Egyptians, Hittites, Persians, Babylonians, and Mongols, were historical 'events' whose successive occupations were as ravaging as the effects of major earthquakes ... Like shooting stars, the various cultures shine for a brief moment before they fade out of official historical and cultural records of Palestine. The people, however, survive. In their customs and manners, fossils of these ancient civilizations survived until modernity—albeit modernity camouflaged under the veneer of Islam and Arabic culture.

This matter is very well established, and genetic studies have proven the Palestinians are actually genetically homogeneous among each other and different compared to Arabs in nearby countries such as Syria and Jordan.modernity camouflaged under the veneer of Islam and Arabic culture.

Much of the local Palestinian population in Nablus is believed to be descended from Samaritans who converted to Islam. Even today, certain Nabulsi surnames including Muslimani, Yaish, and Shakshir among others, are associated with a Samaritan origin.


Giving (currently) Israeli lands to an underdeveloped and politically immature Palestinian authority is not the solution to regional peace, it just spreads it around more.

By your logic, the zionists should have never had Palestine, as it was fertile land that produced tons of wheat and oranges."

&gt; In trying to counteract this, however, the struggle, it seems, has been focused on the wrong unit of analysis, treating all as if they were working within the same paradigm – namely, by treating non-equality as the big deal. While it is true that nothing is equal, it is so abstract – like trying to apply what one sees under a microscope, or through a telescope to everyday reality – as to be almost meaningless, not altogether instructive, but destructive, even.

&gt; I got a clue from a linguist here, sorry about that, Lackoff, who wrote a book called “Women, Fire and Other Dangerous Things.” That clued me onto the idea that people needed to categorize things in order to make sense. However, people do not do so in over particulars or in over generals, but in “human sized” categories – they do not say that there is a mammal on the porch, they do not say that there is an Irish Setter on the porch, they say that there is a dog on the porch. In other words the problem with regard to classification here is confusion and disorganization that results if you do not classify – people have to organize their experiences in optimal categories in order make sense.

&gt; So, I am getting the idea that people need to classify, even though classifying is prohibited by The Constitution’s notion of Individual Rights.

&gt; The last problem that got me to thinking of classification as pivotal was Russel and Whitehead’s Theory of Logical Types: which was meant to solve the classic paradox, “I am a Cretan, all Cretans are liars”: They asserted that the class cannot be a member of itself – thus the class was on a higher logical type than the individual – that can have practical and positive utility for our classifying when we say, for example, I have not been prejudiced but have rather sampled enough individuals of this non-White class to know that I neither want nor need to sample any more of their individuals; I can see their historical pattern as antagonistic, thus I place them under the higher logical type of a class and I discriminate against them as a class. Conversely, I give members of my White Class the benefit of the doubt. In fact, Whitehead said, one cannot continually investigate everything, but must be able to rest content taking some things for granted and proceed from a given state of partial knowledge; he called that a working hypothesis; I call it a functional classification.

&gt; So, here, with this notion of enough of a sample, I am beginning to shift in thinking to the positive purposes that might be served by classifying. Thereupon I could see another important purpose with classifying one’s own – it serves to transcend jealousy – once I classify a people as my family or on my side, then I am inclined to be glad for my brothers and sisters if they are doing well, providing that they are not otherwise terrible.

&gt; And with classification we become more able to assess relative merits or demerits of our people. When we subsume, give the benefit of the doubt to our people, they have more latitude under the rubric of the class to correct their behavior; and we have more complete information of them within the Class, its system, accountability thereof, making us better judges of the relative bad and more lenient on the relatively good amongst us – that as opposed to hyper criticism, trying to find tiny objective points, the arbitrary lashing out, the disorganization that inevitably results from the pseudo objectivism, of this de-contextualization, this de-classification. By subsuming within the class, we are better able to judge the relative good from the relatively bad person.

&gt; Ultimately, with classification, there is a means of accountability and ecology for our 40,000 years of native European evolution.

&gt; Conversely, the notion of empirical rights ruptures our White people from the very systemic class of resources that might otherwise go into their making.

&gt; By contrast, within the class we are more protected in the ecological disbursement of our niches as we qualitatively meander through different expressions, manifestations of the systemic whole; there are probably vital contributions to the system by many persons who are not at the top, cannot and should not be at the top of the game at this particular point in time; thus, when the leftists ask sarcastically, who’s rights are being protected? they have a point; as the interests of some are not particularly well served by individual rights; but can and should be included within the class: a child, a young mother; if I don’t have the same143 i.q. as my brother, I am not going to be eliminated because it will be understood that we are closely related, carrying similar genetic payloads, to be placed under the same White Class though moving into patterned disbursement, different ecological niches in its service. Classification, being a protracted frame of analysis, unlike rights, can include all stages of the developmental process of our White evolution both within a life span and in the history of our DNA.

&gt; Ok, so taking a step back – where is all this stuff coming from? Locke, empirical rights, and non-classification. Well, Tom is right, Christianity is one source in beginning to break down the importance of classifications. I look back to The Epicureans as another source; they were dead set against superstition; they tried to trace everything to physical causes – and they were forerunners of Locke’s empiricism. Their distrust of superstition would seem to be a precursor to a skepticism of racial classifications and the prejudice against prejudice.

In fact, when European Jews came to Palestine they kicked off many of the Palestinians Jews and saw them as squatters. 

Throughout history a great diversity of peoples has moved into the region and made Palestine their homeland: Canaanites, Jebusites, Philistines from Crete, Anatolian and Lydian Greeks, Hebrews, Amorites, Edomites, Nabateans, Arameans, Romans, Arabs, and European crusaders, to name a few. Each of them appropriated different regions that overlapped in time and competed for sovereignty and land. Others, such as Ancient Egyptians, Hittites, Persians, Babylonians, and Mongols, were historical 'events' whose successive occupations were as ravaging as the effects of major earthquakes ... Like shooting stars, the various cultures shine for a brief moment before they fade out of official historical and cultural records of Palestine. 

The people, however, survive. In their customs and manners, fossils of these ancient civilizations survived until modernity—albeit modernity camouflaged under the veneer of Islam and Arabic culture.

This matter is very well established, and genetic studies have proven the Palestinians are actually genetically homogeneous among each other and different compared to Arabs in nearby countries such as Syria and Jordan.modernity camouflaged under the veneer of Islam and Arabic culture.

It's very clear cut, there's no denying that the Palestinian people don't exist.

Much of the local Palestinian population in Nablus is believed to be descended from Samaritans who converted to Islam. Even today, certain Nabulsi surnames including Muslimani, Yaish, and Shakshir among others, are associated with a Samaritan origin.
Giving (currently) 

&gt;Israeli lands to an underdeveloped and politically immature Palestinian authority is not the solution to regional peace, it just spreads it around more.

By your logic, the zionists should have never had Palestine, as it was fertile land that produced tons of wheat and oranges. They had a good exporting based economy and the oranges of Jaffa were a favorite of Europeans."

On their own behalf they were happy to go around having as much sex as they like(which is really no different to Britain or anywhere in Europe really) but most of them stated they would not date a slut.

When I enquired what the terminology slut referred to in this case they told me it was a girl that slept around. So these guys I was ""hanging out"" with were trying to find random sex whilst simultaneously knocking girls for sleeping around.

I think with more experience I have realised American men are often uncomfortable with sexually active girls but take  opportunity to have casual sex themselves.

It's a shame too some of those American women had me mumbling like an idiot. I suppose the best thing to do is offer to show around any attractive American women coming to the UK lol.

It is a rather foul attitude though. I mean as long as your safe and you have fun there is no tangible downside to casual sex and whether or not somebody has had one partner or ten makes no tangible difference.

Worse yet the concept of virginity is laughable. If there is no physical difference then what is virginity apart from a concept that the church would have you believe in?

The ultimate goal is not the well-being of the public, but the well-being of the market itself. If a coal miner gets black lung here, or a factory worker loses an arm due to a faulty emergency stop on a machine there, it's a small price to pay for letting the market handle things.

There was actually one period of time where Libertarian ideology was the only economic system in existence. It was called the middle ages. The poor were actually forbidden to possess money and the rich literally had everything. It didn't ""trickle down"" because concentrating most or all of the wealth into a very small percentage of the population actually drains the economy. 

The Koch brothers aren't going to buy 75,000 Ford Equinoxes this year, but take their wealth and divide it amongst 75,000 people and that becomes a real possibility. Having a strong middle class that can actually save money and have disposable income creates demand redundancy. A given household for example needs 1, maybe 2 refrigerators. It doesn't matter if that household makes $12,000 a year or $12 billion a year. Two refrigerators in most situations is all they'll need. Now, the billionaire family is probably going to buy the top-of-the-line refrigerator while the low-income family will probably get one off of craigslist and hope it works, but still, demand is tied to quantity. It takes roughly the same amount of work to make the Sub-Zero as it did to make the Maytag back in 1986 or whatever. The point is, rich or poor, the average family's demand for goods and services is roughly the same. A billionaire might have 100 cars, but there are far fewer billionaires than there are regular people, so collectively demand in the auto industry as a whole from billionaires is barely a blip on the radar. Plus, they tend to not buy the Chevys, Fords, etc. and instead go for the boutique foreign hand-made manufacturers whose business is centered around low-volume production. There are far more Chevy plants than there are Ferrari plants.

Anyway, the more evenly wealth is applied to a general population, the more demand redundancy increases. A person making $30 million an hour is going to buy at a max around six or seven homes. A million people making $30 an hour are going to buy a million homes. The demand is much greater. In order to supply those million homes, construction companies need to form, grow, expand, hire workers. More workers in the system mean even more demand for products and services. For the most part, demand is what creates jobs. Giving the boss more money isn't going to prompt him to hire more people. Having a larger work load is going to prompt him to hire more people.

One may make the argument that if wealth is spread too thin, it actually restricts the ability for suppliers (i.e., the rich) to meet the demand. Of course, this isn't necessarily true for a few reasons. First, you don't need to be a billionaire to run a company. Second, capital can always be generated by a number of people combining their resources in exchange for a piece of the company (stocks) or forming a temporary corporation. In fact, this is how large public works projects such as bridges got built, a group of businessmen pooling their resources to meet a demand they wouldn't have met alone. These corporations were temporary and extremely project and goal-oriented. They were created to accomplish something, and when it was accomplished, the corporation would dissolve.

Finally, I've heard the argument that supply can actually create demand. This is true as well. Flood the market with refrigerators that cost $200 and lots of people will buy one who otherwise wouldn't. But, how good is a $200 refrigerator going to be? It's either going to be so terrible that eventually demand will drop off because of it's poor reputation, or they're going to be sold for less than what they cost to make, the company isn't going to be in business for long. Products made in the 40s, 50s, and 60s in this country have a reputation for being reliable, except for cars that is (which is due to the lack of international competition during the 50s and 60s as Europe and Japan had to rebuild their industries after WWII). There are other examples, though. Ford's Model T, for example, was designed to be so cheap everyone could afford one. But Ford also understood that in order for his plan to work, the market had to have the income to spend, so he also paid his workers an unheard of sum of money in order to reduce employee turnover. In this case, it wasn't supply alone that created demand, it was supply coupled with innovation coupled with increased wages. Ford didn't just flood the market with cheap cars, he created a self-sustaining ecosystem that is still running today. He didn't farm the work out to a third-world country so he could stamp his name on the product and make a profit. He knew that his workers had to be able to afford the product they were building. Otherwise, there wouldn't be enough demand.

The only time supply creates demand is what the product or service being provided is innovative and creates a new market. Otherwise, the demand is unsustainable and drops off quickly. When it's all said and done, no company will make a product that no one wants or can't afford. If they do, they won't survive."

Usually July-August was spent at home, recording the Tour de France... if the tour wasn't on, he was riding his bicycle.  Memorable anecdote:  A week before our summer trip to Europe my senior year of high school, he decided to try and Lance Armstrong himself down a hill he normally goes down, and apparently failed to negotiate the turn at the bottom of the hill at 60mph. He skid off into the gravel, crashed, bounced on his head (breaking his clavicle and helmet) and flew 25 feet through the air and landed in poison oak.  Needless to say, my mother wasn't a happy camper. 

Lately he takes to cutting down overgrown trees and rebuilding fences for neighbors, for free.  I think he does it because he has a personal vendetta with the root structures fucking with the foundation of his house.  There's a mutual exchange of expertise in the neighborhood my parents live in.  Example:  For helping rip out a tree and a little fence reconstruction, a neighbor who's a plumber helped remodel the bathrooms. 

Oh, and for 3 weeks each summer, my dad goes for refresher classes to stay up to date with his teaching certificate.  It's only a half day, but it comes out of our pocket.  I don't know how much it costs... It can't be much because I never hear him complain about it."

You have to remember George Best was a winger/attacking midfielder, Pele sometimes played as a forward but he was used in the midfield often too and Maradona was a second striker that played deeper or an attacking midfielder.

If your a box to box player like Rooney or a winger like C Ronaldo then you are going to be doing quite a bit of running due to your position.

On the other hand take somebody like Messi. Yes Messi still runs and it still requires a certain element of fitness and speed but he is much more than that. Simply put if he didn't have the skills he wouldn't be scoring many goals.

Honestly even keeping a ball next to your foot at high speed requires a massive amount of skill. Try and sprint about 10 meters with the ball attached to your foot and see if you can do it. I think only Messi and C Ronaldo can go flat out like that and keep the ball. Then you add high speed dribbling and your talking another ballpark.

A lot of the bigger players come from Germany. Badstuber is 6 foot 2 and a half inches and 170 pounds and Daniel Van Buyten is 6 foot 5 and 210 pounds.

Messi on the other hand is 147 pounds and 5 foot 7. Pele was 5 foot 8 and 150 pounds. In fact I don't think there has ever been a striker or attacking midfielder/winger that weighed more than 200 pounds. I don't think theres been an all time top striper that weighed more than 180!

When Pele and Maradona played they weren't big huge guys knocking over defenders the reason they kicked ass was because they would run around the big lumbering Europeans.

If you look at most European clubs now their defenders are often European(Vidic, Ferdinand, Terry) and their strikers/wingers and attacking midfielders are often much smaller South Americans(Messi, Tevez etc). You almost always find bigger players in defense and small players in front, I believe this is true of all of the clubs playing in the Champions League at the moment."

And he was the embodiment of what islam is. 

I believe the Muslim world got to the place its at today because they searched for glory in things other than islam, they lost in most of europe wars they engaged in because they were fighting in the name of secular causes, our lands were conquered and our spirits broken. We forgot how to act in the Islamic fashion that drove the Muslims of the past to great hights. 

It reminds me of a story of umar ibn al khattab, when he was on his way to meet with the nobles of Jerusalem to recieve the keys to the city, he had taken a Servant with him and he would alternate taking turns with this Sergent riding on the camel, one would ride whole the other would walk, when they started approaching the city it was the servants turn to ride, but the servant was shy to be riding on the camel when they arrived, because it would look lowly of umar to be walking while his servant was riding in front of these nobels who were expecting a jaded king, so the servant expressed his feelings to umar and told him to enter the city riding the camel even though it was not his turn and umar responded with these words ""we are a people god has given us honor through islam, if we search for honor elsewhere, we would surely be humiliated""

if we don't get back to learning islam in a scholarly way we'll never succeed, because wanting to be a scholar or even a bit learned in islam drives you to learning about the world we're in, you will notice that allot of the muslim scholars of the past were also scientists and mathematicians. "

Remember that if you are long a call and short a put of the same strike price, that's effectively the same as owning the stock in terms of responses to price changes -- if it goes up, you make money on the call; if it goes down, you owe money on the put.  You effectively have a future (right and obligation) to buy the stock at the strike price.

C(call price) - P(put price)  = S(stock price) - K(strike price) + dividend/interest adjustments.

The quantity on the left is the value of the long call / short put position; the amount on the right is the value of the future.  The reason for the interest adjustments is that unlike buying the stock now, you get to hold on to your $ until the option expiration, which is worth something (S exp(-rT) in fact).  If the stock pays dividends before option exercise (assuming the options are European; w/ american options, things are a bit more complicated), you have a future for the ex-dividend stock, so you need to subtract out the discounted dividend flow.  

Anyway, given these equations, if you plug in the values of the current stock price, option strike, call value and int/div adjustment parameters, you can get the value of the put.  "

Of course, soy is not neccessary for a vegan diet, but I do find it convenient."

Could they win the war against the Soviets? (Capturing all the major cities and destroying the Soviet leadership). Probably not. If you define winning against the Soviets as taking huge parts of land from the western side and keeping them, then it's probable, although it's more probable that the Soviets would counterattack a few years later.

You could also say that taking over the biggest part of Europe and N. Afrika &amp; leaving Russia alone would be ""winning"", and it's pretty possible that it could be done and still survive a future war with Russia some years down the line.

We're getting into some pretty big ""ifs"" though, if the Germans never fought the Soviets would the Americans &amp; allies ever land in France. And even if they did, they'd have to face a few more million German troops with great combat experience.

&gt; Another reason for our halt was fear of the snow, for on the road there is a mountain called Hindukush, which means ""Slayer of Indians,"" because the slave boys and girls who are brought from India die there in large numbers as a result of the extreme cold and the great quantity of snow.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur#Indian_campaign

&gt; Timur entered Delhi and the city was sacked, destroyed, and left in ruins. Before the battle for Delhi, Timur executed 100,000 captives, mostly Hindus:[4][26]
&gt;
&gt;""At this Court Amír Jahán Sháh and Amír Sulaimán Sháh, and other amírs of experience, brought to my notice that, from the time of entering Hindustán up to the present time, we had taken more than 100,000 infidels and Hindus prisoners, and that they were all in my camp. On the previous day, when the enemy's forces made the attack upon us, the prisoners made signs of rejoicing, uttered imprecations against us, and were ready, as soon as they heard of the enemy's success, to form themselves into a body, break their bonds, plunder our tents, and then to go and join the enemy, and so increase his numbers and strength. I asked their advice about the prisoners, and they said that on the great day of battle these 100,000 prisoners could not be left with the baggage, and that it would be entirely opposed to the rules of war to set these idolaters and foes of Islám at liberty. In fact, no other course remained but that of making them all food for the sword. When I heard these words I found them in accordance with the rules of war, and I directly gave my command for the Tawáchís to proclaim throughout the camp that every man who had infidel prisoners was to put them to death, and whoever neglected to do so should himself be executed and his property given to the informer. When this order became known to the gházís of Islám, they drew their swords and put their prisoners to death. 100,000 infidels, impious idolaters, were on that day slain. Mauláná Násiru-d dín 'Umar, a counsellor and man of learning, who, in all his life, had never killed a sparrow, now, in execution of my order, slew with his sword fifteen idolatrous Hindus, who were his captives.""

It sounds like they were as bad as or worse than the Christian crusaders to me. In fact the idea that Muslim religious warriors were less vicious that Christian ones seems like a version of the Noble Savage idea to me. The problem is that the Muslims weren't savages - at least not in the Noble Savage sense. They were at a comparable level of societal organisation to the Crusaders and like them were profoundly savage to conquered peoples. And for much the same reason - ordinary people went to war back then to rape, plunder and capture slaves. The opportunity for ""harshness"" to the general population after a conquest was the reason they took the risk of signing up.

The bit about Mauláná Násiru-d dín 'Umar reminds me of this

&gt; Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it, you'd have good people doing good things and evil people doing bad things, but for good people to do bad things, it takes religion.

Um, no. I didn't even mention the project in my first comment because I've only run only one demo.

I gave it a chance -- I ran demo in three browsers. It didn't work well in any of them. I can give it another chance when they fix bug and do a better demo.

&gt; just throwing it in a pile with badly developed JS games

So you think it wasn't a badly developed JS game? :-/

&gt; Plus, you can't spell.

Really? For example?

I'm not a native English speaker, but I believe my spelling isn't that bad, especially when I use spellchecker.

Or by spelling you mean grammar? I know it sucks. Or typos? I don't typically proofread my reddit comments.

And WTF is this nitpicking, you want to go ad-hominem route? I've seen comments with really shitty spelling but people had no problems with them as long as they are readable at all.

&gt; You also told him not to post here until other people (supposedly underneath you, as you are only to be shown demos of incredibly polished games) approve of it.

I think demo 1) should be impressive; 2) should work. If it is not like that I see no point in showing it, as it won't be able to serve demo's purpose and instead will give both engine and JS bad reputation.

I said nothing about posting in general, only about posting demo as a success story.

If he said ""That's what I got so far, please help fixing bugs"" it would be another thing. Or if he would highlight the fact that code used for this game is particularly elegant and beautiful it would be another thing.

But title of this post is ""Fruit Ninja in JavaScript"", so it is about this specific game, and game sucks. What my reaction should be?

Also here's submitter's reply to my comment:

&gt; The problem is I am using version 0.3.2 instead of the latest which is not out yet and fixes most bugs. It is for a presentation and I didn't want to use the newer version because it's not out yet.

WTF dude, you couldn't wait few weeks until you make a bug-fixing release? r/programming is 338,382 readers (plus, probably, millions of lurkers), you really want to show millions of people your half-backed product? (As opposed to fully-backed.)

I've seen people working hard to fix all known problem when they're doing presentation at their school, showing it to, maybe, 10 fellow students. That's quite a difference in attitude.

&gt; And apparently you didn't read the first sentence of my post, as I said that I saw where you were coming from. But you're still a giant douche.

No, it really puzzles me.

Usually there is no shortage of comments praising a project/demo, even if it is not very good.

But criticism is not welcome, especially if it is aimed at a person doing open source project rather than at faceless corporation. It just isn't considered polite, as you've demonstrated with your comments. So people are afraid to honestly voice their opinions.

But, you see, I'm Russian, we have slightly different politeness standards here. It is not like all Russians are rude, but _on average_ they are somewhat more rude than Europeans and English-speaking people.

Also I personally have no problems being harsh and nagging people. (You can as well call it a 'giant douche' but usually it is kind of funny.)

So I can write negative comments honestly voicing my opinion and I think you should praise me for covering shortage and providing comment diversity which is necessary for interesting and meaningful discussion.

I don't write short meaningless comments like ""it sucks"", I don't write hate-filled rants. I usually write rather long, thorough comments which explain my opinion in all details.

So why do you call me 'a giant douch'? Do you seriously think that my comments do not provide any value to reddit discussions?

Or maybe it is a ritual of some sort?

1. Other people write praising comments.
2. I write negative one.
3. You reply ""you're a giant douche"" with a remark ""I see where you're coming from"" which actually means that you agree with my comment but calling me douche is required for politeness ritual.
4. Now we have full spectrum of comments in reddit discussion while politeness guidelines were satisfied -- person which made impolite negative comment was publicly shamed by being called a douche.
5. Profit!

And of course, there's the potential that Americans spend more because they want more. Also not factored into your analysis is the fact that many (if not all) European countries pay for a lot of health care via deficit spending, which has unaccounted for interest.

We can see that [health care costs across the first world have been rising at about the same rate](http://i.imgur.com/S938w.png), (although I'm sure you can expect it to jump in the wake of the PPACA), and this indicates that the USA has no inherent problem with holding down costs.

In addition, the data that indicates Medicare is more efficient administratively is very sketchy because the government can push administrative costs onto doctors and patients (the same way they do with the tax code). For example, a physician's staff spends an *entire hour* handling a single Medicare claim on average. [Mark Litow](http://www.milliman.com/why-milliman/consultants/litow-mark.php) estimated these hidden costs and found that Medicare and Medicaid spend 26.9 cents for every dollar of benefits, compared to 16.2 cents spent by private insurance.

There are numerous other datasets that show the superiority of the (admittedly flawed) American healthcare system. [Americans spend more time with their doctors](http://imgur.com/VQJJC), [have better access to dialysis and coronary surgeries](http://i.imgur.com/rDG4S.png), [have more MRIs and CTs](http://i.imgur.com/vROVq.png), [get non-emergency surgery much more quickly](http://i.imgur.com/PqRda.png), and survive [prostate](http://i.imgur.com/dmRx2.png) and [breast](http://i.imgur.com/As6Nf.png) cancer much more often then their single payer counterparts.

In addition, the american elderly are [generally much more satisfied with care](http://i.imgur.com/e2kEG.png). The annual rate of cancer deaths is 70 percent higher in the United Kingdom than in the United States.

The worst part is that single-payer systems often don't even succeed in the one area they are universally expected to: providing equal access to health care. The British government commissioned two studies (The Black Report and The Acheson Report), which found that health care access, if anything, had become *less equal* then before the NHS was instituted. [Canada's health care is unreasonably focused on urban areas](http://i.imgur.com/P0YFp.png).

Single payer systems are notoriously bad at allocating resources. More than one million people are waiting to be admitted to NHS hospitals, but the equivalent of 1,692 full-time doctors are tied up waiting for patients who do not appear for appointments or call to cancel. If the NHS did nothing more than charge patients the full costs of missed appointments, it would free up enough money to treat thousands of additional cancer patients each year. Yet doing so is not seriously considered. British “patients” take between 18 million and 19 million ambulance rides each year—about one ride for every three people in Britain. Almost 80 percent of these rides are for such nonemergency purposes as taking an outpatient to a hospital or a senior to a pharmacy and amount to little more than free taxi service. While thousands of people die each year from lack of kidney dialysis, the NHS provides an array of
comforts for chronically ill people with less serious health problems.

Ask yourself, do you really want your health care run by the George Bushes of the world? The most recent example of single payer failure that I've heard; the NHS has been refusing smokers certain treatments on the basis that they tax the system, even though the data shows that smokers on average use less healthcare then non-smokers.

Why anyone would look at the complete irrationality and corruption of the electoral process and then decide to hand medicine to the goons in Washington is beyond me.

In a legal, free market system with complete information two equally good pairs of shoes will have the same price, so you would not have to produce more but exactly as much. Otherwise the more expensive shoes would not be sold. So overproduction is not a nessesary result.
Of course in reality crap shoes are sold as high prices because brand names infer status. This can create monopoly-like situations. Only Coca-cola can sell coca-cola. However you could look at this price difference as the monetary value of status. 

Most overproduction, by which I mean supply that is greater than the demand, is a result of government subsidiaries. These make the production of a good more attractive, independant of demand.

In the end rather than change industries (I'm in too deep, and have a mortgage) what I did was start studying part time in things that interested me, as well as becoming an ambassador for a charity.

I started studying Mandarin, Chinese because I've always been interested in languages, and have enough French and German down to not have to worry about European languages for a while.

The charity was easy, to a degree, and it gave me insights into an industry that I otherwise wouldn't have had access to. I ended up becoming involved with a micro-finance charity, (they give microloans to people in third world countries to help them start businesses). For me, I liked it, and it gave me a 'toe-dip' into the not-for-profit space.

This 'toe-dipping' could be a good thing for you, as you will gain exposure to a new industry, and give you a chance to find a charity/NFP that you really enjoy and could see yourself continuing on with.

I'm sure you'll get heaps of 'just fucking do something' recommendations, but I'm not going to say that. What I would say is, work down into the deeper motivations of what you're hoping to achieve from hypothetically working for an Aid organisation. Do you want to help people? Do you want to teach people something? Do you want to travel? Do you just want to get the crap out of an office environment?

Bigger scale questions of - where do you want to be by the time you retire, and work backwards to figure out how you can get there, can be worked out later.

Linkedin - is gold, here's why: Do you know someone who has the job you want? If so, go find them on Linkedin and then look at what they've done to get there and then look at replicating/mimicking it.

I have to downvote your title ""intelligent democracy"" - I spent 3 years in Japan - that description is very very inaccurate of how politics works in Japan. "

Hey fuckface, you wrote:

&gt;AKA, Africa. I don't want to live in Africa.

It's not pedantic to expect you to not claim that a libertarian society would look like Africa. Expecting you to honestly represent my political believes is a reasonable expectation in normal political discussion.

&gt;no environmental laws. no labor laws. 

I wouldn't even say libertarianism is against environmental laws. You could have government agents police emissions to ensure no pollutants are being emitted and that would be consistent with free market principles.

Labor laws wouldn't exist, but who gives a shit? You don't have to work for a company that has poor work safety standards, and they will see it in their interest to improve work safety to attract workers, since it is a type of benefit just like wages.

&gt;no guarantee of education or healthcare.

Yep, you take risks of having nothing in a free market society, but the economy develops faster, so you have a higher likelihood of having a higher standard of living. 

Either way, you will face risks in life. From what I can see, risks are lower when wages and per capita GDP are higher. Hong Kong and Singapore were third world countries 60 years ago, have topped the economic freedom index for the last 16 years in a row, have no minimum wage, have half as much social welfare spending per capita as Europe, have had the most rapid economic growth of any nations in the world over the last 60 years, and today have higher life expectancy than every European country with a population of 0.1 million+."
