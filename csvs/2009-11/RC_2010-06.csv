With twin barrels packing a one-two wallop, this big-bore Pistol was popular with Europeans exploring the vast jungles of India and Burma in the mid-1800s. On a typical excursion, explorers and soldiers were part of an elephant caravan. Riding on a howdah (the basket perched atop an elephant) may look safe in today's world, but a century ago danger was imminent. Tigers could scale the side of a slow-moving elephant in the blink of an eye. To combat surprise attacks, the Howdah-style side-by-side pistol was created. Two cavernous 20-gauge smoothbore barrels or .58-caliber rifled barrels can be loaded with buckshot, a single slug, or the devastating ""buck and ball""-load common in big-bore muzzleloaders used on dangerous game. Squeeze one of the triggers, and you'll appreciate the hand-conforming checkered walnut grip and the recoil-soaking end-cap counterweight. Its case-hardened lockplates are engraved with detailed wild animal scenes. Convert your Howdah pistol into a potent carbine by adding a detachable hardwood Shoulder Stock.

Analysis on the IHH, the organization responsible for the convoy, from the Danish Institute For International Studies (A very well-respected organization): http://www.diis.dk/graphics/Publications/WP2006/DIIS%20WP%202006-7.web.pdf

Here the following about IHH is reported on page 10: 

&gt; Yet, the phenomenon of charitable front groups that provide support to Al-Qaida is by no
means exclusively limited to the Arabian Peninsula. Indeed, elsewhere in the Muslim world,
other such entities have been established with near equal success – as in Turkey, with the socalled
Foundation for Human Rights, Liberties, and Humanitarian Relief (IHH). Turkish
authorities began their own domestic criminal investigation of IHH as early as December
1997, when sources revealed that leaders of IHH were purchasing automatic weapons from other regional Islamic militant groups.43 IHH’s bureau in Istanbul was thoroughly searched,
and its local officers were arrested. **Security forces uncovered an array of disturbing items,
including firearms, explosives, bomb-making instructions, and a “jihad flag.” After analyzing
seized IHH documents, Turkish authorities concluded that “detained members of IHH were
going to fight in Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Chechnya.”**


&gt; According to a French intelligence report, the terrorist infiltration of IHH extended to its
most senior ranks. The report, written by famed counterterrorism magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguiere,
revealed that IHH President Bulent Yildrim had directly conspired in the mid-1990s to
“recruit veteran soldiers in anticipation of the coming holy war [jihad]. In particular, some
men were sent into war zones in Muslim countries in order to acquire combat experience.”
Furthermore, in the hopes of “obtaining political support from these countries, financial aid
was transferred [on behalf of IHH], as well as caches of firearms, knives, and pre-fabricated
explosives.” **An examination of IHH’s phone records in Istanbul showed repeated telephone
calls in 1996 to an Al-Qaida guesthouse in Milan and various Algerian terrorist operatives
active elsewhere in Europe – including the notorious Abu el-Ma`ali, who has been subsequently
termed by U.S. officials as a “junior Osama Bin Laden.”**
During the later Seattle trial of would-be Al-Qaida Millenium bomber Ahmed Ressam, federal
prosecutors called French magistrate Bruguiere to the stand as an expert witness. **Bruguiere testified that IHH had played “[a]n important role” in the Al-Qaida Millenium bomb plot
targeting LAX. Under repeated questioning, Bruguiere insisted that “[t]here’s a rather close
relation”**

And there's more of IHH's dubious activities in the report.

Heh, you're turning your own argument against yourself.

I wasn't the one who said other countries would use nukes. I was responding to **you saying that Israel might nuke a 500 ship flotilla of foreign aid ships**. If that were to happen, you can bet your pants that any country that lost lives would nuke right back if they could. First use of nukes is hard, retaliatory use of nukes against first strikes is easy.

Yes, I know, you added later that you were only kidding about the nukes. That's fine, but try to remember it's your argument that I'm answering. To summarize, my argument has been that if Israel indeed nuked a 500 ship foreign aid flotilla as you said, they'd be in danger of retaliatory nuke strikes in return, and **not just** from the delcared nuclear powers, because many other undeclared countries have nukes too, or could get them within the week if they wished.",worldnews,0,0,True,2,1426327345,False,xenofon,,c0r6rgh,True,0,t5_2qh13,1275406740,,t1_c0r6rgh,t1_c0r6pwi,t3_ca1yi

Labour MEP for Dublin [,Ireland]

Tuesday 1st June 2010

 

ATTORNEY GENERAL SHOULD PREPARE A CASE AGAINST ISRAELI MINISTERS FOR PROSECUTION IN THE IRISH COURTS

 

Labour MEP Proinsias De Rossa has announced a special meeting of the European Parliament Delegation to Palestine, which he chairs, to discuss the Israeli armed attack on the humanitarian aid convoy with the deaths of 9 people.

 

Both Palestinian and Israeli diplomats will be present to address the meeting. All reports indicate that the convoy was up to 400 Kilometres from Israel at the time of the attack, and that the ships were unarmed.

 

Mr. De Rossa stated that there was a prima facie case for legal action by member states against Israel for kidnapping their citizens and for the use of disproportionate and illegal armed force against shipping in international waters, from which there was no obvious threat. ""I urge the Irish government to instruct the Attorney General to prepare a case against Israel under the Geneva Conventions for hearing in Irish courts"", he said.

 

""It is obvious that this latest breach of international law by Israel requires a response which goes beyond the usual rhetoric and handwringing. Member States and the EU have the economic wherewithal to make it clear to the Israeli government that we will no longer accept such tactics from a state which prides itself as being part of the community of democratic states. The EU trade agreement with Israel should be suspended, as should the transfer of any moneys from EU programmes such as the 7th Research and Development programme.

 

While I welcome the various calls from the EU and the UN for an independent enquiry into the assault on the convoy, it must be clear by now that this enquiry has to be an International enquiry. An enquiry by Israel of it self, by itself, would not be credible, given its response to the findings of the Goldstone Report on the Israeli war on Gaza over a year ago which cost the lives of over 300 children.

 

Equally an enquiry which confines itself to the actions of the soldiers would be inadequate. This is not simply a question of soldiers overreacting. It is clear that Israel has a doctrine of using disproportionate force, which puts civilians at grave risk. This was the finding of the Goldstone report when it identified the heavy loss of civilian life, not as a consequence of soldiers being in breach of orders, but as a consequence of following orders from the highest political level. Consequently an enquiry must also seek to establish the political responsibility for this latest and needless loss of life.",worldnews,0,0,True,6,1426327352,False,BakersDozen,,c0r6rzc,False,0,t5_2qh13,1275407256,,t1_c0r6rzc,t3_ca6s6,t3_ca6s6

But after that, the DoD budget isn't going into manpower. It's going into R&amp;D and hardware. And as hardware goes, the ROI for aircraft carriers is pretty damn good, especially if we do shut down overseas bases as cost saving measures. 

There are other places to cut costs that aren't DoD - there needs to be fiscal responsibility across the board. Entitlements, federal agencies, etc. Trimming government and expenditures everywhere will do far more good than just trying to squeeze all the savings out of DoD.

He promoted two options to address the Jewish problem, the first was creation of a Jewish state in Palestine to push the Jews to leave Europe. The other option was violence against Jews. 

Fichte's thesis that Judaism constituted a separatist state in permanent conflict with other states had a perceptible effect on a number of German thinkers and politicians.

The early German Zionists claimed Fichte as one of their ancestors, raising the cry, ""We must become little Fichtes"".

&gt;Today, Kurdish is an official language in Iraq. In Syria, on the other hand, publishing material in Kurdish is forbidden.[14]  Before August 2002, the Turkish government placed severe restrictions on the use of Kurdish, prohibiting the language in education and broadcast media.[15][16]  The Kurdish alphabet is still not recognized in Turkey, and the use of Kurdish names containing the letters X, W, and Q, which do not exist in the Turkish alphabet, is not allowed. Kurdish education in private institutions is allowed in Turkey, but there has been little demand for these courses.

&gt;In Iran, though it is used in some local media and newspapers, it is not used in public schools.[17][18] In 2005, 80 Iranian Kurds took part in an experiment and gained scholarships to study in Kurdish in Iraqi Kurdistan.[19]

&gt;In March 2006, Turkey allowed private television channels to begin airing programming in the Kurdish language. However, the Turkish government said that they must avoid showing children's cartoons, or educational programs that teach the Kurdish language, and could broadcast only for 45 minutes a day or four hours a week.[20] However, most of these restrictions on private Kurdish television channels were relaxed in September 2009.[21]

&gt;The state-run Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT) started its 24-hour Kurdish television station on 1 January 2009 with the motto “we live under the same sky.”[22] The Turkish Prime Minister sent a video message in Kurdish to the opening ceremony, which was attended by Minister of Culture and other state officials. The channel uses the controversial X, W, Q letters during broadcasting.

I would get out of the city and try to find a country estate -- here (France) there are many old farms and chateaux with big walls around many acreas of hunting ground, with streams/ponds and forests.  But more importantly, they have places where you can build things and store diesel, and are located in country areas where there is lots and lots of agricultural machinery.  And where there's agricultural machinery, there is scrap metal and welding torches.

Well, having worked at the Georgia Botanical Gardens as a climatology intern, I can tell you with a great deal of accuracy that CO2 levels in greenhouses are kept artificially high in order to induce greater plant growth.  Plants need a higher concentration of CO2 to grow larger, not oxygen.  Duh.

I can also tell you that the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is (at least partially) responsible for the ""consensus"" that Pres. Obama and other world leaders are saying about climate change.  The cherry-picking, destruction, and manipulation of data at the Siberian and Greenwich CRUs is being done by **scientists**, not politicians.  If politics were only at issue, I'd blame the politicians, but where are they getting this data?  Certainly not from me and my cohorts.

&gt;How is that a bad thing? What is wrong with working with an issue that has not been solved?

The IPCC and its legal arms in America, Europe, and around the world are not only treating AGW as ""settled science,"" but they are implementing policy decisions based on that.  These decisions, just like the corn-ethanol debacle here in America, may mean a few more cents on the dollar for us in the developed world, but bankruptcy and starvation for people who only make a few dollars a month in undeveloped countries.  People whose heating oil will now be just expensive enough that they might not survive.  Hell, it's been estimated that over a million people have starved to death due to shortages because of the government's subsidization of large amounts of corn for ethanol instead of using it for aid.  How many more might die because of the higher price of heating oil after cap-and-trade?  This isn't just a scholarly debate anymore.

&gt;His presentation of standard science as observing laws is nonsense of course. But Rothbard is quite clear that in his view praxeology consists of starting with known truths and using deduction to produce answers. Utter and complete nonsense.

We'll have to agree to disagree on whether Rothbard's views are 'nonsense,' but how do you think scientific experimentation evolves?  Not by deduction, but by positing--testing hypotheses.  This works just fine for hard sciences, for which the variables can be known.  In the social sciences, you still have not shown me how it is possible to account for all the variables in play and still maintain any sort of coherent hypothesis.  The very statistical models that mainstream economists used did not predict the Crash of '09 any more than they predicted the crash that led to the Great Depression.  So why are you still defending bad science?

As I've said before (though you've not listened), the problem is not with the scientific method, but where it's applied--social sciences simply are not given to rigorous scientific controls.  Therefore you have only one option--first principles, like in Aurelius' *Meditations*.  What is the thing in itself?  What is its function?  Matters of philosophy, which is what your linked article argues.  I happen to agree with Rothbard on this.  What i've neglected to hear in all these posts, however, is your counter-argument.  So why is Rothbard wrong?  Why is the scientific method good for the social sciences?

As for your criticism that I'm labeling my beliefs by contrasting them to the beliefs of others, of course I am. That's how you get specific with your beliefs. That's what everyone does.

Hitler surrounded himself with a lot of like minded people. Some of them (Goebbels and Himmler come to mind) were probably just as whacked out as he was. Anti-semitism wasn't created by Hitler. It had been around for 100's of years and was rampant even among your basic law-abiding citizens of Europe at the time. He used it as a way to seize power and to create a common enemy. ""The Final Solution"" was actually though up by his 2nd in command Himmler. Who knows what would have happened if someone would have assassinated Hitler when he started invading his neighbours in 1936.  Maybe the Nazi party would have carried on pretty much the same but with a different leader. Maybe whoever was in charge would not have been as aggressive. We'll never know.

On the other hand, Saddam Hussein was a dictator who had an iron grip on his country. One thing he managed to do was to keep the fighting between the 2 main groups the Shia and the Sunni's under control. When the American's took him out it allowed all these people who hated each other to now be able to fight each other and the American's. Getting rid of Hussein probably created a bigger problem. 

As for genocide's. These go on all the time in Africa. (Currently there's one going on in the Congo.)  However when there was a genocide in Rwanda in 1994, all the leaders of the world and the UN stood by and let it happen. It was a rebel leader Paul Kagame an ex-patriot who ended up seizing power after 100 days of killing. He's still in charge today.

,1,"We're speaking in broad, sweeping generalities—which are always subject to criticism—but, stereotypically, every ethnic group has its particular ""look"". We all know that Spain, for instance, has a 20% blond rate. But, internationally, when people think of the prototypical ""Spaniard"" they think of someone like Antonio Banderas. Likewise, with Englishmen. We know that there are a variety of different English ""types,"" but—in the popular imagination—images of John Cleese rise up in people's thoughts. 

Likewise—while Jews have a number of different genres—the popular image of a Jewish person (especially in the 18th and 19th centuries) was someone who looked like, say, Barbra Streisand and Amy Winehouse. People with a distinctly Middle Eastern appearance, owing to their origins in Palestine. 

True, within the last fifty years, Jews have [finally] been marrying outside their ethnic group, and are now (at last) experiencing assimilation. For instance, Alicia Silverstone is half-Scottish, and greatly resembles her non-Jewish parent. Or Paul Newman, who's father was German-Jewish and whose mother was a Hungarian Gentile (and, in looks, he resembled his mother).

So you get people—nervous, in a post-Nazi world—rushing to point to people who are half-Jewish and saying, ""But see? Jews can look like anything!""

That's true in the modern age. But not so true before intermarriage became commonplace. Pure Jews—especially the kind born 100 years ago in, say, Poland or Russia—had a distinctive look that owed a lot to their Middle Eastern origins. And they weren't unattractive. They were a very handsome people. It's just that, living in European countries that they weren't native to, they stood out—as a Sicilian might, who lived in Sweden. Or a Greek who moved to Norway.

Take, for instance, this picture of Jeff Goldblum standing between Ed Begley, Jr. and Jon Voigt. http://cache2.asset-cache.net/xc/81535998.jpg?v=1&amp;c=IWSAsset&amp;k=2&amp;d=77BFBA49EF8789215ABF3343C02EA548AD2C67A482A1BF4FAADF484C006EF6E1CE47900FE223DEB7E30A760B0D811297

The handsome Goldblum (while arguably better-looking than his Gentile fellow actors) stands out like a sore thumb between them. With his dark olive complexion and black hair, he has a very Middle Eastern appearance that sets him apart from his Northern European colleagues. Thus Goldblum's ancestors stood out like sore thumbs in Russia, among Slavs.

That's why there was a disgusting ethnic component to bigotry against them. They typically *looked* different from surrounding host populations. The stereotypes of the prominent nose or the dark complexion weren't born in a void. Someone of Middle Eastern ancestry isn't going to look like an Irishman.

And that holds true not just for Jews but for all Middle Easterners across the board, like Lebanese-American Danny Thomas (who always made fun of his big nose). Or Armenian actor Mike Connors, who spoke about his Armenian ancestry and said, ""Most Armenians don't typically look all-American, I know that.""

So it's not beating up on Jews, or trying to single them out. It's just that, when you have a separate community and that community doesn't generally marry outside their ethnic group [like Gypsies in Europe] they maintain certain ethnological traits, even after centuries have passed.

Which is why Amy Winehouse was born in England, but could easily have stepped off a street in Syria. Or why Sasha Baron-Cohen was born in London but could easily pass for an Iranian.

There should be no shame attached to having Middle Eastern ancestry. It's cool. (Most women would keep an Israeli like Oded Fehr over a Western-European like Dudley Moore in a heartbeat. Or Jeff Goldblum over Ed Begley, Jr.) But the fact remains: If you went to a Jewish shtetl in the years running up to World War II, you wouldn't mistake the residents of that village for Irishmen or Norwegians. 

And that's what screen icon Tony Curtis was complaining about: Jewish film moguls in the old studio system discriminating against actors who looked ""too Jewish"" and playing up Jewish actors who didn't look overtly ""ethnic"". It's depressing but as recently as the 1990s David Schwimmer—of ""Friends"" fame—had trouble getting cast because casting directors worried that the olive-skinned, dark-haired actor was ""too ethnic"". After the explosion of the popularity of the hit TV show, all these bigots were proven wrong. But it's instructive to realize that people like Schwimmer, as late as the 1990s, were still encountering bigotry (even from Jewish casting directors). *Especially* from Jewish casting directors.",reddit.com,0,0,True,1,1426328049,False,Drooperdoo,,c0r88c0,True,0,t5_6,1275449484,,t1_c0r88c0,t1_c0r812a,t3_cad22

The application of the term to old women is possibly a shortening of the term ""faggot-gatherer"", applied in the 19th century to people, especially older widows, who made a meagre living by gathering and selling firewood.[9] It may also derive from the sense of ""something awkward to be carried"" (compare the use of the word ""baggage"" as a pejorative term for old people in general).[7]
&gt;It is sometimes claimed that the modern slang meaning developed from the standard meaning of ""faggot"" as ""bundle of sticks for burning,"" presumably with reference to burning at the stake.[7] This is, however, unlikely to be the case,[7] and there is no tradition of burning at the stake being used as a punishment for homosexuality in Britain,[10][11] although supposed witches and heretics were burnt to death in other parts of Europe, and were often accused of deviant sexual behaviour.[12]

,8,"No, it's based on actually reading books on physical anthropology by people like Coon and Lundman. The Mediterranean nation with the highest blondism rates would be Spain [with 20% of its population demonstrating blondism]. Blond hair and fair eyes dip off incrementally the further east you move in the Mediterranean, the rates dropping as you hit Italy [12%], move on to Greece [8%], Turkey [4%], etc.

Once you hit Israel, Syria, Lebanon, etc. black hair statistically becomes the norm. While blondism exists—and exists naturally—it's in the single-digits.

I was watching a documentary on Israel recently, and a little kid had dark blond hair and blue eyes. It was a Palestinian kid. You could tell his hair would be brown in adulthood, but there it was: blond in childhood.

So Jews had these traits—recessively—before they ever entered Europe. They exist naturally in all Mediterranean populations, albeit in low numbers.

The larger statistical outlier among Jews is NOT blond hair, but red hair. (That, too, exists naturally in the Middle East. One of Saddam Hussein's generals was a redhead, as was Mohammed, according to the Koran.) Ashkenazic Jews got an even higher red-haired ratio when they bred with European populations [like Khazars and Slavs]. So red hair you see naturally occurring. Blond hair . . . not so much.

The overwhelmingly statistical rule is black hair in the region. Up in the 70-80% ratios. Dark brown hair is next, with about 10-15% having it. Next comes red hair. And, last—as an extremely low percentage—is naturally occurring blonds.

* Footnote: Interestingly, North African Berbers had—according to Carleton Coon's ""The Races of Europe""—the world's fourth- or fifth-highest redhead rate. As recently as Antiquity, they apparently had extraordinarily high rates of blondism, as well. The Egyptians—calling them ""Libyans""—referred to them as ""The White Race"" and depicted Berbers as blond and blue-eyed. They apparently got darker as Arabs conquered the region and started to bring in blacks from beyond the Sahara. But the original stock appears to have been very fair. This was circumstantially confirmed when the Spaniards discovered the Canary Islanders in the 1400s. They were shocked to find islands full of tall blonds. When DNA tests were done on the Canarians [in the modern age], it was confirmed that they were descended from the original Berber stock. Isolated, though, the Canarians didn't get darker as demographics changed in the rest of North Africa. On their islands, they retained their original ethnological character. Further DNA testing showed that Berber mitochondrial DNA was identical to the Saami of Finland and Scandinavia. So the theory is that, during the Ice Age, as European populations headed south into Spain, some traveled a bit further into North Africa. So the ancient Egyptians weren't smoking weed when they portrayed the ""Libyans"" as blond and fair-skinned, referring to them as ""The White Race"".

You still occasionally see the original phenotype, as in this picture of Berbers in the modern age: http://mathildasanthropologyblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/berberchildwh1.jpg

Thanks for the links.  They confirm what I suspected.  That israel owns that land and there is zero punishment for these ""illegal"" acts.

&gt;There is no reason to believe that the Arab countries were going to attack or exterminate anybody. From the wikipedia entry on the 67 war:

Ha. Right in your same article.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War#The_drift_to_war
&gt;Speaking to the UN General Assembly in September 1960, Nasser had stated that ""The only solution to Palestine is that matters should return to the condition prevailing before the error was committed - i.e., the annulment of Israel's existence."" In 1964 he said, ""We swear to God that we shall not rest until we restore the Arab nation to Palestine and Palestine to the Arab nation. There is no room for imperialism and there is no room for Britain in our country, just as there is no room for Israel within the Arab nation."" In 1965 he asserted, ""**We shall not enter Palestine with its soil covered in sand, we shall enter it with its soil saturated in blood.**""

Essentially you are saying that if the americans had known about the japanese attack, intercepted it, and blew it up, it would mean america started the war with japan for protecting itself.  That is a very pathetic way of looking at reality.  Israel only one the war because of the preemptive strike to knock out the Egyptian airforce.

&gt;And Israel in its current form does not deserve to exist. Its an apartheid-like European colony on Arab soil that was built on the ethnic cleansing of the native people. It needs to be abolished.

It would be great if that was true, but sadly it is not. It's just that smaller countries are far less in the news due to their (lesser) global significance, but nonetheless can do enormous damage to the world and have done so throughout history.

Let me give you a few ""modern"" examples:

- Belgium had military forces in Rwanda just before the slaughtering started there. The Belgian army forced citizens from Rwanda to carry ID cards. On those ID cards was inscribed to what tribe a person belonged. (Which is a similar idea to the David-star that Nazi's forced Jews to wear)
Needless to say the result was horrible. Due to that inscription on the ID card rebels knew which tribe everyone belonged to, so they started to slaughter all the civilians of the other tribes. Over a million people died horrible deaths, including women, children and babies. The Belgian army left just before the slaughter got heavy.

- Not long after WW2 The Netherlands started a war against Indonesia in order to keep them colonized after 300 years of occupational colonization.

- Recently it has become known that in WW2 Swiss banks (secretly) funded the Nazi regime. 

- Some years ago several European bankers funded 2 tribes in Nigeria to wage war against each other. They gave 1 tribe slightly more money than the other and the best funded tribe won. 5 million civilians died in that war. Those bankers funded that war, because under the ground where those tribes lived there were major deposits of Lithium. Those bankers wanted that Lithium so they could sell it on the world market so that it could be used for mobile phone batteries. The tribe that won was the one that was favorable to sell that lithium to those bankers for a nickel and a dime. Most mobile phones batteries contain exactly that Lithium, because it's the cheapest Lithium on earth.

The way the mobile phone market works over here (regulation) ensures that you can see exactly how much the phone is going to cost you. You can get exactly the same contract for less money (and no commitment) if you choose to go to the same teleco without a ""free"" phone. So if I bring my old handset and take a contract for 300 minutes a month it'll cost me £15; if I want my cell provider to give me a Desire that very same contract will cost me £25 a month for 24 months.

Thus having a phone which promises to be updated with the next version of Android in 12 months time does offer value to the consumer. Users may choose to buy such models, if it were offered to them. 

It would be fantastic if phone manufacturers would release updates for 2 years after release, and it really wouldn't be that hard for them to do so for the most popular models (considering how Cyrogenmod &amp;c manages to do so); the thing that prevents them is the huge variety of models that manufacturers release.

Yes, its political rhetoric between countries that are not on good terms. And where does he say he wants everyone in a country to die? Stop making stuff up.

&gt;That is a declaration of war.

No, it isn't. Countries that are not on good terms commonly exchange such bombastic threats.

&gt;Israel would have been stupid to wait for these nuts to build up their armies and attack first.

Israel doesn't deserve to exist in the first place. Its a European colony on Arab soil and the Arab response is completely understandable. They're not nuts at all. And there is no evidence that the Arabs were building up their armies to attack first. You've just made that up.

&gt;Israel would have lost had they not preemptively destroyed egypts airforce.

Lost what? Israel launched the war, remember?

&gt;It would be like the US preemptively bombing japanese air strips because they intercepted proof that japan was going to bomb pearl habor. Japan is still the aggressor who shot first.

Except there is no good evidence that Egypt was going to attack Israel. None at all. I'll paste the paragraph again:

&gt;Yitzhak Rabin, who served as the Chief of the General Staff for Israel during the war stated: ""I do not believe that Nasser wanted war. The two divisions he sent into Sinai on May 14 would not have been enough to unleash an offensive against Israel. He knew it and we knew it."" Menachem Begin stated that ""The Egyptian army concentrations in the Sinai approaches did not prove that Nasser was really about to attack us. We must be honest with ourselves. We decided to attack him."" [76] Former Chief of Staff of the armed forces, Haim Bar-Lev (a deputy chief during the war) had stated: ""the entrance of the Egyptians into Sinai was not a casus belli,"" but argued instead that the Egyptian blockade of the Straits of Tiran ultimately caused the war. Major General Mattityahu Peled, the Chief of Logistics for the Armed Forces during the war, said the survival argument was ""a bluff which was born and developed only after the war... ...""When we spoke of the war in the General Staff, we talked of the political ramifications if we didn't go to war —what would happen to Israel in the next 25 years. Never of survival today."" [77] Peled also stated that ""To pretend that the Egyptian forces massed on our frontiers were in a position to threaten the existence of Israel constitutes an insult not only to the intelligence of anyone capable of analyzing this sort of situation, but above all an insult to Zahal (Israeli military)[78]""

The war was an imperial campaign of expansion by Israel. That is obvious.

&gt;Why don't you point out the punishments. I laugh at these international laws. They have no punishments. 

The only reason that punishments haven't been enacted is because the US blocks any such attempts in the security council you clueless buffoon. You see it is up to the UN security council to decide what the punishments are.

&gt;Thus they aren't really laws.

That does not follow. Just because the US blocks any attempt by the International community to punish Israel doesn't mean they aren't really Laws. It means that you are an idiot.

&gt;They are just mutually agreed upon codes.

Like the code that murder, rape and theft is wrong? 

&gt;Well israel doesn't have to mutually agree to them. 

That's what criminals always claim. That they aren't subject to laws and moral standards dictating acceptable conduct and can do whatever they want.

,3,"No. Changing this one law will have a negative consequence if changed in a vacuum -- where no other legal or cultural changes are made.

Maturity is not decided by age but instead by culture and parenting. This leads to the bigger problem that current American culture of parenting couldn't handle it. Here's what I mean;

I was an American expat living in Europe when I was a teenager. I went to bars when I was 15 with kids who were even younger. I also knew plenty of American's overseas who's parents wouldn't let them drink and so they rarely went out with us. I believe their parents wanted them to stay kids (read naive) forever or least until they were out of the house and don't have good role models during an important period of maturing. Then they went to college and it was like the Hoover dam broke and all ""family values"" went out the window. It was irony at its finest.

The rule in my house was if you drank, you were not allowed to leave until the next morning. I had a mini-fridge/bar in my room so there was good incentive to stay in. Since driving wasn't legal until age 18 (one of the issues that must also be looked at) this was even easier for my parents to enforce. Not only was all of this perfectly legal, it was effective. And yes sometimes we got drunk. Really drunk. But then we also learned how to handle the alcohol and how to drink like (somewhat) responsible drinkers.

When I went to college, I wanted nothing more than to be able to sit in a bar, like I had been since I was 15 but couldn't without a fake ID. I quickly learned that American culture keeps its kids mentally immature long after the rest of the world has gone and grown up. In high school we are kids. In college we are tethered kids and now, according to the new health care bill, we can stay legally dependent on our parent's insurance until the age of 26 (I think that's what I read)!! That's crazy! 26? Seriously, I get why some think this is a good idea but dependent on our parents until the age of 26 for insurance but able to drink 10 years before is NEVER going to happen. To me this insurance change is a clear indication that the American perception of a dependent child is heading in the wrong direction, but I digress.

,-2,"&gt; Not everyone in Europe upgrades their phones after 12-18 months, and the cell providers here are now pushing 24 month contracts as the default.

That's irrelevant. As I said:

&gt; most of the phones from **users that care about app availability** will get cycled out so quickly

The people who hold on to older phones are people like me that couldn't care less because I don't use anything more advanced than SMS. Meanwhile users like my wife, who does care about app availability, and who is on an 18 month contract, are twitching to upgrade and willing to pay break clauses to upgrade early.

&gt; You can get exactly the same contract for less money (and no commitment) if you choose to go to the same teleco without a ""free"" phone.

I know. I'm currently about a year ""overdue"" for an upgrade, and as a result my contract is only 10 pounds a month for about 600 minutes. I was actually recommended not to upgrade, since deals as generous as the one I'm on aren't offered anymore, so I'm far better off buying a phone outright. 

But this is not how users that care about fancy phones behave. Half my office is on their second or third iPhone, for example.

&gt; It would be fantastic if phone manufacturers would release updates for 2 years after release, and it really wouldn't be that hard for them to do so

It wouldn't be hard, but why would they? They're in the business of pushing new phones, not giving people another reason to hold on to their old phones. It makes zero business sense unless consumers start making purchasing choices based on whether or not they're likely to get OS upgrades. 

&gt; As long as the UI updates quick enough, and you can watch a TV show on your phone whilst commuting, what else do you need CPU cycles for? Is there any need to have the latest phone, beyond compatibility?

Micro USB or bluetooth + Wireless HDMI coupled with a keyboard, mouse and a LCD TV or monitor with the appropriate interfaces = home computer. Or just Wireless HDMI = HD quality video player for your next TV.

In other words: Expect the manufacturers to find new reasons to push processing speed for quite a while longer.

&gt; One would think these kids would be amongst the quickest to update.

On the contrary, that's a segment that are focused on getting the most minutes and texts for the least amount of money. You'll find these are the type of users that may have multiple phones, but cheap ones, and often juggle 2-3 sim cards, often pay as you go, to get the best rates for whoever they need to all (my wife used to do that...)

,1,"&gt;30 miles is pretty reserved. I would say at least 50 miles would be the standard. At least for the US, china, japan, russia, england, etc.  

For what? Territorial waters are set and agreed upon internationally, this occurred outside of that.

&gt;200 miles is the economic zone limit. Israel was well within that.

Indeed, and if Israel had been setting up a rig, or mining the sea bed for minerals, or dealing with fisheries that might be fine (assuming that the area was within an Israeli economic zone), but they weren't, this was a ship being boarded and the crew attacked.  If this had been a Russian warship that action would have been utterly unthinkable after all and the blame would not have been on Russia..

&gt;And to top it off arguing that israel has no right to intercept smugglers is a joke. No country is going to say israel does not have the right to do this. Because all countries historically have patrolled much father out than 30 miles.

They do, but this ship wasn't smuggling anything anywhere, it was in international waters with no contraband (as far as international law is concerned) aboard. If it had been a pirate, slave or a drugs boat then there are treaties that allow certain action, it wasn't.

&gt;Depending on the metric, that would be +3 or +12. Not ""much further"". 

Look, there are maps available all over the place, the flotilla was at a Latitude od 32.64113 and a of Longitude:33.56727 when it was attacked, that is around 70 miles from the closest part of Israeli controlled territory.

&gt;I laugh at that comment. The ship admits it was going to violate israeli waters and was smuggling.

They were in international waters, so it wasn't violating anything and you can't 'smuggle' things that Israel has legislation against outside of waters where Israeli law applies.

&gt;If Turkey really want to back these smuggling vessels, israel can legally accept that as a declaration of war and a first strike. No way turkey is going to do that.

No, exactly.  Instead this will cause a diplomatic stink and we will see Israel suffering some diplomatic setbacks. Hell this incident seems to have managed to piss off both the Turks and the Greeks to the point where they are actually taking similar positions, that in itself is fairly impressive...

&gt;How is it wrong? Israel won the land in war. I accept a countries right to take land when it is the victim of aggressors.

Israel either has a responsibility as an occupier, or it is failing to ensure it's own population is treated in a manner consistent with international law. I would add that your acceptance of what rights countries have has no bearing on what international law says and what the UN security council has deemed to be acceptable.  Remember that these kinds of international statutes are essentially the entire reason for Israel's existence as a state, so they aren't something trivial to be ignored at will.  If they are trivial then surely the issue of countries or parties not recognising Israel is a non issue, which of course it is.

&gt;The reason why europe went back to the way it was, is because the US was willing to back a return to normalcy and occupy germany to make sure that happened.

Erm.. If we ignore the whole Soviet Union thing, the whole UK thing and various other elements, not to mention the fact that WWI taught us rather a lot of lessons on what not to do at the end of wars, and if we ignore the international conventions that came out of WWII then yes, your statement would be correct, as it stands it is either overly simplistic and omits most of the important factors, or it is simply wrong.

&gt;Right now israel is still attacked by suicide bombers and terrorists from neighboring countries.

Indeed they are, they are attacked by people in the areas that they occupy.  It is something that is very wrong and something that Israel has every right to deal with, much the same way as the UK had the right to deal with issues in N.I, but there are limits on what is acceptable and there are standards to be adhered to.  Not to mention the fact that Israel has no right to punish those living in a given area for the actions of a very small minority, certainly not the right to starve the population.

&gt;Nothing in the middle east suggests israel can safely put it's guard down. Until that changes, expect israel to keep the land it won and continue to build up it's defensive forces.

I would agree that Israel's safety is still threatened to a certain degree, I don't think that this threat is existential and as you keep pointing out, the US will back Israel.  So things like Israel's nuclear weapons are a problem (and Israel should be disarmed), Israel's attacks on its neigbours are a problem and Israel's refusal to protect the human rights of those within its authority are a problem.  In short Israel should be able to protect itself, but it should not in turn threaten everyone around it, that simply leads to more of a mess.

Part of the reason that it would become a mess would be that Turkey would claim to have been attacked, and claim that Article 5 of NATO requires the rest of NATO to come to the aid of Turkey to defeat Israel. The US would resist vigorously any such Article 5 declaration, and this would result in a rupture in NATO that would effectively end the organization. At a minimum, Turkey would end the US/NATO's ability to use Turkey to both stage attacks in Iraq and move supplies into Iraq [1]. 

In the past year, Turkey has been drifting away from ""The West."" Partly due to their inability to get admitted to the EU [2]. Partly due to a slow drift Islam-wards [3]. It is my belief that the Turkish government in Ankara has been wanting to break off relations with Israel, and Israeli forces attacking the flotilla was the perfect excuse. 

A fracture between the US and Turkey would result in Turkey's military stomping on the Kurds in Iraq. Those Kurds call their region in Iraq as ""Southern Kurdistan"" [4], and when Kurdish terrorists in Iraq attack Turkey, the US has bullied Turkey into ""turning the other cheek."" 

Notes:   
1 - Probably half of the supplies come into Iraq via Turkey, as Basra is the only port in Iraq that can handle cargo ships.  
2 - France and Cyprus have made ultimatums for Turkey's admission that is impossible for Turkey to comply with, and still remain Turkey.   
3 - [Ataturk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk)'s vision for Turkey was as a secular nation, with the Army as the enforcement mechanism for secularity. In the past, when the government started getting too religious, the army would march in, depose the government, hold elections, then march back to their barracks. With the government arresting many ""[deep state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_state)"" activists in the military, the military in Turkey is not likely to be able to depose an increasingly religious government.

,3,"Yeah, the question is somewhat simplistic, I agree.  It arose from a graphic I saw in the context of the European debt fiasco that's ongoing.  The graphic (I believe it was from the NY Times ... I'll try to find it) showed all the debt circulating throughout Europe.  In almost every case it was a two-way street -- i.e. Country X owes country Y some amount, but Country Y also owes Country X some amount.

I realize the debt is mostly owed by private entities.  So, my curiosity was regarding how much other nations owe to U.S. entities, be they public or private.  The bottom lines is, how much money, in the form of debt payments from other nations, is flowing back into the U.S. economy.

,8,"Hijacking boats in international waters and killing passengers is, of course, a serious crime.  The editors of the London Guardian are quite right to say that: “If an armed group of Somali pirates had yesterday boarded six vessels on the high seas, killing at least 10 passengers and injuring many more, a NATO taskforce would today be heading for the Somali coast.”

It is worth bearing in mind that the crime is nothing new.  For decades, Israel has been hijacking boats in international waters between Cyprus and Lebanon, killing or kidnapping passengers, sometimes bringing them to prisons in Israel including secret prison/torture chambers, sometimes holding them as hostages for many years.

Israel assumes that it can carry out such crimes with impunity because the U.S. tolerates them and Europe generally follows the U.S. lead.

Much the same is true of Israel’s pretext for its latest crime: that the Freedom Flotilla was bringing materials that could be used for bunkers for rockets.  Putting aside the absurdity, if Israel were interested in stopping Hamas rockets it knows exactly how to proceed: accept Hamas offers for a ceasefire.

In June 2008, Israel and Hamas reached a cease-fire agreement. The Israeli government formally acknowledges that until Israel broke the agreeement on November 4, invading Gaza and killing half a dozen Hamas activists, Hamas did not fire a single rocket. Hamas offered to renew the ceasefire. The Israeli cabinet considered the offer and rejected it, preferring to launch its murderous and destructive Operation Cast Lead on December 27.  Evidently, there is no justification for the use of force “in self-defense” unless peaceful means have been exhausted.  In this case they were not even tried, although—or perhaps because—there was every reason to suppose that they would succeed. Operation Cast Lead is therefore sheer criminal aggression, with no credible pretext, and the same is true of Israel’s current resort to force.

The siege of Gaza itself does not have the slightest credible pretext.  It was imposed by the U.S. and Israel in January 2006 to punish Palestinians because they voted “the wrong way” in a free election, and it was sharply intensified in July 2007 when Hamas blocked a U.S.-Israeli attempt to overthrow the elected government in a military coup, installing Fatah strongman Muhammad Dahlan.  The siege is savage and cruel, designed to keep the caged animals barely alive so as to fend off international protest, but hardly more than that.  It is the latest stage of long-standing Israeli plans, backed by the U.S., to separate Gaza from the West Bank.

These are only the bare outlines of very ugly policies, in which Egypt is complicit as well.

At the end of the day, siding against Israel would make US-Turkish relations rather complicated and difficult.  The US might still need Turkey as a base for the ongoing conflict in Iraq, but if it ever came to having to decide between the two countries, they'd still side with Israel.  Hell, it might even encourage them to be more sympathetic to the Kurdish separatists (even if it would never amount to anything, simply a realistic looking threat would freak Turkey out).  

I honestly don't know who would win in a war between the two countries, but if Israel pulled the nuke card (which, if Turkey was joined by other nations, they might) it would be a short fight.  And that's assuming the US doesn't get involved, which can't be ruled out, regardless of pretty much anything.  And I'd wager Turkey is aware of this.

*It is the usual modus operandi of Arab rulers...* The Turks aren't Arab, but I know what you were getting at, and there's validity to it.

It's Tayyip that's been pushing for EU ascession. CHP have been fairly light on the matter as a lot of Turks vary from not caring to being quite resentful of Europe for various reasons, including being treated as second class citizens. As for aligning with Iran and Syria they've been less hostile for years but there's zero chance of aligning with either of those as the military wouldn't stand for it and the US would definitely be against it (and the US is an important ally and trading partner).

Here's the thing, until recently Turkey was acting as a neutral mediator as a friend of both Israel and the Arab states. The Lebanon and Gaza incursions made it politically unacceptable for Turkey to remain neutral but they still tried to remain partially friendly. The act of piracy committed by Israel against Turkish people makes it now impossible to be anything other than an enemy of Turkey in the short term unless justice is served. I'm sure there's discussions and negotiations going on, but Turkey has had it's blood shed and will want an eye for an eye. Add to the fact that the Turks are master negotiators and you're talking about two eyes for the price of one.

Still most of the people in turkey see Turkish armed forces as a defender against the radical islamists but they are impotent to perceive that democracy can not survive in a country where the armed forces acts out of the control of the parliament and the government who is elected by the citizens. 

Secularist faction is in a paranoia that secularism would be swept away if the army did not interfere with the affairs of the state. That is a ridiculous idea because the anti-secularist radical islamists consist about %15 percent of the population.

I did not mean to imply that you felt one way or another, I was venting, not accusing you of supporting our policy's towards it.

The Marshall Plan (which I think was a good thing in most regards - except in France who abused it) was initially a force for good but ultimately set up to benefit American corporations and stop the spread of the dreaded communists.    It would have gone down better with Europe if we had given the money, without the interference and conditions, and just scheduled a reasonable payback.

,0,"&gt;Have you ever been shot at or even had a gun pointed at you?

Yes. I grew up in South Africa. Although I don't think anecdotal evidence should really form the basis of discussions like this, I can't disguise that my anti-gun stance is largely motivated by my experiences with gun crime.

I don't want this to turn into a dick measuring contest about who has been the victim of more crime or something like that, but I have seen people get shot dead just so someone could steal a cellphone and a wallet. I have been mugged many times but every time I was calm and cooperative and lucky enough to get away without being hurt.

I have also woken up inside my own home with a gun in my face. In all the situations where I have been robbed there was never a chance for me to use a gun even if I had owned one. That is why I think their usefulness in self defence is vastly overstated. I think carrying a gun is going to make it even more likely that a criminal will shoot you.

&gt;There will always be guns in existence.

Probably. However, in the UK there are very few guns around. Sure they sometimes get used in crimes but in general the crime here is nonviolent or you might get stabbed in the worst case scenario. There are hardly any gun murders in muggings or robberies.

&gt;Organized crime (the only statistically significant users of criminal firearms) will see to it. Criminals run their own import/export businesses. Most firearms used in Canadian gun crime were illegally imported firearms.

Well I am not worried about the use of firearms by organised crime. They don't want my wallet or my TV. I don't see why anyone besides law enforcement needs firearms to deal with organised crime.

&gt;Also in Canada, where handguns are quite easy to legally obtain, most violent crime is committed with knives and related non-gun instruments

I don't know enough about Canadian gun law to really comment. Maybe they have much harsher sentences for gun-related crime?

&gt;But why should the police be armed and not the rest of the population?

They shouldn't. As long as the police need to carry guns, then it must be legal for the public to have them. I don't want to force the public not to have guns. I want to change the perception that they are actually useful in self defence.

&gt;If you don't have a gun, you can still be a threat very easily. A street thug will rob you of your phone and wallet, stab you a couple of times and kick you in the face if you aren't prepared to defend yourself.

In my experience that is not true. They don't want to make trouble for themselves. Getting caught after mugging someone is minor. Getting caught for stabbing someone who died is much more serious. Generally I think it is immensely stupid to try to fight back against an armed attacker if all they want is your wallet and phone. My life is worth much more to me than all the wallets and phones on the planet.

&gt;A criminal with a gun is likely to not shoot you ""just for kicks"" because it makes too much noise and ammunition is harder to come by than another knife.

Sure. That is why I don't think you need a gun. He probably won't shoot you anyway. If he is going to shoot you, your having a gun won't change his mind. However, if he wasn't going to shoot you but he sees you have a gun, he might change his mind and shoot you because you are a threat.

&gt;Seems like you haven't really had to deal with dangerous neighbourhoods and the types of situations that can occur in a thug-ridden urban environment.

As I said. I grew up in Johannesburg in South Africa. While I don't think this argument should be based on anecdotal evidence I also don't want you to assume that I am some American brat from the suburbs who has never stared down the barrel of a gun.

&gt;A compelling reason to own a firearm for home defense is not because you can kill people, or even shoot at them. 9 idiots out of 10 will run at the sight of a gun or the sound of a gun cocking.

Unless they have a gun, of course. In that case they shoot you.

&gt;If you were woken up in the middle of the night by 6 16ish year old kids kicking in your window and swarming your house, running up the stairs, raping your wife and young daughter in front of you while two of them stabbed and beat you senseless, you'd wish you'd owned a firearm. You'd wish for it even more if the police took 45 minutes to respond because they ""know it's a bad area.""

Security gates? Burglar bars? Alarm system? All of these things allow you to protect yourself. Besides, if six people enter your house with the intention of killing you and raping your wife, there is still a good chance having a gun won't help.

I also don't think it is a very realistic example. Most burglars don't want to kill you and rape your wife. They want you valuable possessions.

&gt;I've been a responsible firearms owner for year. I was taught how to safely and responsibly handle firearms since I was about 8 years old.

Of course people like you aren't the problem. If all firearms users were responsible then it wouldn't be a problem. Unfortunately there are lots of irresponsible firearms users.

&gt;Never once have I heard of someone using their legal firearms for illegal purpose except for one careless fellow who really shouldn't have owned guns in the first place and only hurt himself.

Generally they get stolen and then used in criminal activities.

&gt;Diligent Licensing and training is the answer to gun violence. Not banning guns.

&gt;True, but Palestinians have been attacking Jews in the region from before there was an Israel.

I recommend you read some Israeli history books. Perhaps Ilan Pappe's [The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine](http://www.amazon.com/Ethnic-Cleansing-Palestine-Ilan-Pappe/dp/1851685553/ref=bfac-20/183-7249894-1074157?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1275582296&amp;sr=8-1), or Noam Chomsky's [Fateful Triangle](http://www.amazon.com/Fateful-Triangle-Palestinians-Updated-Classics/dp/0896086011/ref=bfac-20?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1275582316&amp;sr=1-1) or any number of books.

Yes, the Palestinians did attack Jews before the creation of Israel. But you're omitting the tiny little fact that the Jews were arriving en masse from Europe and Russia with the intent to create their own state.

&gt;“The aim of the [Jewish National] Fund was ‘to redeem the land of Palestine as the inalienable possession of the Jewish people.’...
&gt;As early as 1891, Zionist leader Ahad Ha’am wrote that the Arabs “understood very well what we were doing and what we were aiming at’...
&gt;[Theodore Herzl, the founder of Zionism, stated]:
&gt; ‘We shall try to spirit the penniless [Arab] population across the border by procuring employment for it in transit countries, while denying it employment in our own country... Both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly’...
&gt;At various locations in northern Palestine Arab farmers refused to move from land the Fund purchased from absentee owners, and the Turkish authorities, at the Fund’s request, evicted them...The indigenous Jews of Palestine also reacted negatively to Zionism. They did not see the need for a Jewish state in Palestine and did not want to exacerbate relations with the Arabs.” 
John Quigley, “Palestine and Israel: A Challenge to Justice.”

Secondly, why are you omitting Jewish attacks on Palestinians??
Haven't you ever heard of the [Irgun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irgun)? Or the [Hagana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagana)? Or [LEHI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehi_%28group%29)?
To say ""the palestinians attacked Jews before Israel was created"" is an utter and absolute misrepresentation of history. There were attacks on both sides, and the Zionists were intent on driving out the Palestinians. 

If Mexicans move en masse to Canada tomorrow, with the intention of creating a Mexican homeland in Quebec, then the Quebecers will **obviously** fight them.

So the fact that you mention how Palestinians attacked Jews and not that both attacked each other is either a sign of brainwashing by a media that keeps repeating it, or a lack of knowledge of the history, or simply a racist outlook whereby Palestinian lives don't mean as much as Jewish ones.


&gt;“Serfs they (the Jews) were in the lands of the Diaspora, and suddenly they find themselves in freedom [in Palestine]; and this change has awakened in them an inclination to despotism. 
&gt;They treat the Arabs with hostility and cruelty, deprive them of their rights, offend them without cause, and even boast of these deeds; and nobody among us opposes this despicable and dangerous inclination.” 
Zionist writer Ahad Ha’am, quoted in Sami Hadawi, “Bitter Harvest.”

Lastly, David Ben-Gurion, the 1st Prime Minister of Israel had this to say:

&gt;‘in our political argument abroad, we minimize Arab opposition to us,’ but he urged, ‘let us not ignore the truth among ourselves.’ 
&gt;The truth was that **‘politically we are the aggressors and they defend themselves... The country is theirs, because they inhabit it, whereas we want to come here and settle down, and in their view we want to take away from them their country, while we are still outside’**
Quoted from Noam Chomsky 'Fateful Triangle'

So again. Why do you insist on repeating ""but Palestinians have been attacking Jews in the region from before there was an Israel""

Israel is occupying their land. They have a right to resist as you agreed. I'm not saying it's the right way, but it is pure and utter irrationality to demand a country to stop resisting when another country occupies it. Nobody on earth questioned the Finns when they resisted the Soviets. No one on earth questioned the South Koreans when they resisted the North Koreans. If Israel went back to it's 1967 borders, and Hamas was STILL firing rockets, THEN you would have a right to argue that.




&gt;why should Israel accept the constant judgments against them

a) Because they do terrible illegal things
b) Because Israel is a signatory of the UN charter - so it must abide by them.

&gt;Despite the fact that Palestinians were the ones who dissolved the UN solution in 1948, and when Israel won, they offered amnesty, equality and repatriation so families wouldn't be split. 

Again, either you are lying, or you don't know what you're talking about. 

“Arab rejection was...based on the fact that, while the population of the Jewish state was to be [only half] Jewish with the Jews owning less than 10% of the Jewish state land area, the Jews were to be established as the ruling body — a settlement which no self-respecting people would accept without protest, to say the least...The action of the United Nations conflicted with the basic principles for which the world organization was established, namely, to uphold the right of all peoples to self-determination. By denying the Palestine Arabs, who formed the two-thirds majority of the country, the right to decide for themselves, the United Nations had violated its own charter.” 
Sami Hadawi, “Bitter Harvest.”



&gt;Back to a previous point. You said that it was wrong because it was illegal. Legality is measure of society's acceptance of a behavior. 

No. What kind of a statement is that??

Somalians accept piracy because they have a non-functioning government. So by your logic of ""society's acceptance of a behaviour"" Somalia can argue that they are perfectly in the right when they pirate ships.
Of course, this is  untrue, because as any human being imbued with logic can tell you, piracy is illegal by international standards.

So Israel can feel hurt and betrayed all it wants - but it still can't attack foreign ships in international waters just because they think their society's acceptance of a behaviour is the only thing that matters.
Your view has such a stench of inherent racism it's absurd.

What about what Palestinian society? Did you even consider them when writing that absurd sentence?
If they accept suicide bombing, then by your ridiculous logic we can say that despite the UN condeming it, they are free to do so!

First, I simply don't believe you when you say that ""we"" (ie you) want to find the truth behind the ""Armenian incident"".  The truth is that it was a systemic, planned and state-endorsed genocide.  It was not an incident.  And the Turkish government's response to recent UN resolutions, votes in the US congress and even public statements shows that almost any discussion of this issue results in immediate knee-jerk reaction from the government.  Perhaps the people feel different, but the actions of the state speak louder.

With regards to torture, if there was a recent prosecution, then ***self -evidently the problem is not solved!!***  When is the last time a member of British police, or the German police, or the Irish police were prosecuted for torture?

You can read the entire report [here](http://thereport.amnesty.org/sites/default/files/AIR2010_AZ_EN.pdf#page=275) (in PDF format).

The issues surrounding the PKK and the Kurds is a complex one.  Undoubtedly the PKK are terorrists.  The Kurdish people, however, are not.  Turkey, *just like Israel*, is engaged in the persecution of an entire people as a result of the actions of an armed band of insurrectionists and, we should never overlook, for reasons of maintaining the integrity of its borders.

Since 1994 it has received support from the Pioneer Fund and is dedicated to the ideal of the United States as a white European nation. Dinesh D'Souza has described its activities as ""white racism"".[1][2]

&gt;It sponsors publications and books, and has held the biennial American Renaissance Conference since 1994. The organization was founded by Jared Taylor, who is its current president. The group publishes the American Renaissance, a monthly magazine describing itself as ""America's premiere publication of racial-realist thought."" The New Century Foundation has also published a pamphlet The Color of Crime about the relationship between race and crime in the US, discussing in particular higher crime rates amongst blacks and hispanics.[3] The Anti-Defamation League criticized the New Century Foundation for promoting ""genteel racism"" and for employing dubious techniques to claim the superiority of whites and the need for racial purity.[4]

It also publishes a magzine which has featured contributions from the likes of [Nick Griffin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Griffin), [Bruno Gollnisch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Gollnisch), [Samuel T.

I'd have to disagree on that one.  I was born in Lviv [West Ukraine], migrated to Australia when I was 5 with my mother, but the rest of our family is still over there.  

My mother, grandmother and uncle have a severe hatred for Russia, along with many of their friends.  

My uncle was in local politics for a while, really popular and they wanted him to go higher up.  But he couldn't take the bribery and bullshit.  Much of it came from Russians who had moved to Ukraine.  This is where some of the hatred comes from, the rest is a mixture of Russia messing with Ukraine's politics [a la Orange Revolution], the deal with Chechnya, every Russian they have ever known being a wanker and the whole USSR thing [my grandparents on my mothers side met in a Gulag, and there are ties to the Holodomor].

This is where my obviously biased opinion starts.  You're from the East, so we won't agree but I'll throw my 2 cents in anyway.

I think it's bullshit that Russia and Ukraine should be together.  Russia rapes Ukraine over and over again.  Now the Russian puppet that is Yanukovych is trying to get Russian on equal ground with Ukrainian.  Russia is already huge, and it's difficult to maintain any sense of nationality in such a vast territory.

Part of the reason our politics is so messed up is that you have the East being mostly Russians now, wanting to go with Russia and the West wanting to claw independence and get in to the EU.  The East is more populated, so they usually win any power struggles.  At the moment, our relations with Russia couldn't be any stronger.
 
There's lots of corruption and joining with Russia will probably aggravate that, there's even more corruption there.

It's a shitty situation.  The way my family see it, there are a few choices.  West and East split, the East becoming part of Russia.  The younger generations gain awareness and realise that Ukraine is an independent country.  A war starts between the West and East.

Neither you or I were there, so your opinion of the event holds no more *a priori* value than does mine.  However, some things are indisputable.  Hundreds of thousands of Armenians were forcibly removed from their homes and forced to march.  Many hundreds of thousands died.

This is no different from the WWII Death Marches undertaken by the Nazi Germans at the end of the Second World War, or the [Bataan Death March](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bataan_Death_March) inflicted upon Filipino and American Prisoners of War by Imperial Japan.  Saying ""we didn't shoot them, they just died from starvation/exhaustion/dehydration/local violence"" etc is disingenuous in the extreme.  The march was planned.  It caused their death, according to plan.  Whether you were rounded up and forced to march depended upon your ethnicity.  Therefore, *by definition*, it was genocide.

Based on past actions (and how else can we judge Turkey's actions), the government ***self-evidently*** does NOT want to address the facts of the matter.  Prosecuting Orhan Pamuk ***RETROSPECTIVELY*** (for something that wasn't even a crime when he gave his interview), because he said *""I repeat, I said loud and clear that one million Armenians and 30,000 Kurds were killed in Turkey.""* is evidence enough to me that they (the government) are not serious.  This happened in ***2006***; only four years ago.  Pahmuk's statement is also rather akin to what you yourself have said above.  It is patently not anti-Turkish (whatever the heck that means).  I wonder if you would get much support were you to stand up outside the Blue Mosque in Istanbul with a placard repeating what you have said above?  I suspect you too may be ""visited"" by the local police.  And I doubt there would be international indignation and a global campaign on your behalf to have any charges dropped.  One wonders what would happen in that hypothetical circumstance.

WRT to torture and basic human rights (which are taken for granted in the EU), saying that it doesn't happen due to minor traffic infringements anymore is meaningless.  As I referred to above, Amnesty International have said that little progress has been made in this area.

Finally, claiming that I have no proper knowledge of the issues (how would you know?) and therefore, one assumes, cannot comment upon it is like saying that because I'm not German I can't talk about WWII and the Nazis.  That reaction alone proves my point!  The Turks have a long way to go.

,1,"&gt;I think you are missing my point. Everyone is entitled to an opinion about anything, but the fact that Israel's stand is oppressive is not universal truth, it's just an opinion. I understand you are thoroughly convinced in the opposite, but it still doesn't make it true. 

Sure, and the same right back at you. Everyone's talking in opinions here, and I never claimed otherwise, so now we're back at square one. 

&gt;Tell me why no one is talking about Hamas threats to kill Jews, their violent takeover of Gaza when they assassinated entire Fatah clans as they pleased, as well as many blown buses and cafes in Israeli cities. This is either a collective memory loss, or, more likely, a selective approach to judging things. 

Plenty of people talk about that. Nobody's claiming that Hamas is an innocent victim here. The many civilians who have no affiliation with Hamas, and whose greatest crime was being born Palestinian in Gaza... *those* are the innocent victims of the blockade. And if you want to talk about shortsighted politics, I fail to see how basically reducing the Gaza strip to a downright unlivable slum helps Israel in the long term. It just gives a whole generation of Palestinians a *fairly reasonable* set of reasons for hating Israel. 

&gt;Hamas was offered to renounce their claims to destroy Israel in exchange for peace and cooperation. Should be a simple choice, right?

That's not even close to the offer that was made. The *preconditions* for negotiation included:

* unconditionally recognizing Israel's right to most of the contested territory
* Acknowledging the legality of Israeli settlements that were built on occupied territories, which is illegal according to international law
* Abandoning attempts to negotiate the right of return for Palestinian refugees

Israel precluded any real negotiation by making its hardline stance a precondition for even beginning discussions.  

&gt;So maybe a point of view opposite to yours has at least as much ground as yours. 

Based on what?  

&gt;Which means that many people that are having issues with ""billions going to Israel"" have issues with Israel to begin with.

What do you mean by ""to begin with""? I do have a number of problems with Israel above and beyond the billions that America spends on it, is that what you're talking about? I have a problem with America's insistence on unconditionally vetoing any UN measure that is unfavorable to Israel. I also have a problem with Israel's refusal to negotiate for peace in good faith, and the fact that a number of innocent civilians who wanted nothing more than to provide humanitarian aid were brutally killed.

Am I holding Israel to a higher standard than oppressive dictatorships around the world? Of course I am, and why shouldn't I? Israel's a close ally, and you *should* be able to higher standards. If you couldn't, then why would they be your ally in the first place? And this is even more true when it's your own actions that enable them.

&gt;What would be less strange is that if some people were upset just about the money, but it's always the same theme of ""us financing those bastards"", kind of like a drumbeat. And that in turn sounds a lot like people from the other countries that, in the absence of own tax dollar factor, simply stick to ""those bastards"" line with mighty ferocity. Which btw you still didn't offer explanation for. 

I didn't answer it's not for me to answer. I can only speak with authority to why I take significant issue with the current direction of Israel. I don't know why other people think the things they do, and it's not my responsibility to answer for them. 

That said, if I had to go out on a limb, I'd say that other countries, particularly western European ones, understand that Muslim extremists are acutely aware of the role that many of them played in creating the Israeli nation post-WW2. Ever since, the existence of Israel, and the conditions under which it was created, has been a source of enormous tension between the west and most of the middle east, and the entire western world, to varying degrees, has suffered from this conflict. 

In of itself, that's just global politics at work. The governments that oversaw the creation of Israel understood that there would be backlash, and they played their role anyways. But what really gets to me, and what I imagine really gets to them as well, is how unwilling Israel is to negotiate for peace in good faith. Look again at the preconditions that I listed above: that's equivalent to saying 'peace is impossible', because frankly it's an unprecedented and ridiculous set of demands. Don't take my word for it, either, ask Noam Chomsky (unless he's now an antisemite too). 

Is there a double standard there? I'm not convinced, although I do think that there *should* be a double standard, again on the grounds that you should hold your allies to a higher standard. If Canada pulled half of the stunts that China routinely gets away with, we'd rightfully roast them, because they're supposed to be our allies.  And it wouldn't be because of antisemitism then, either. It would be because they're supposed to believe in freedom, equality, democracy, and all of that jazz, while China makes little to no such claim.

To me, it seems like you've already concluded that we're all antisemites, and you'll (mis)construe every opposing argument out there to make it true. Frankly, I find that a little paranoid and disingenuous, and your posts seem to contain far more underlying prejudice than most of the ones that you accuse of antisemitism. Still, I hope that I've at least managed to convince you that a lot of us put more nuanced thought into our positions than you initially seemed inclined to believe.

I'm a little disappointed that you insist on arguing against viewpoints that you claim that other hypothetical people must have, rather than addressing the actual positions that I took, but oh well.

Whew.  Anyway, in that chapter he talks about working at Berkeley and coming to see how the traditions of non western cultures deserve as much respect as what we inherit from European traditions as science.  I can't find any point at which he explicitly mentions epistemological post modernism though.  I guess I was just left with a strong feeling that he was getting at that.  
In fact, in the first chapter he demonstrates some disdain for postmodernism.  In a footnote he mentions that he has come to believe that the use of reason in exploring alternative methods such as anarchistic science is becoming more important in order to protect against the chaotic and potentially inhumane results of postmodernist philosophy.  He was writing in 1975 at Berkeley, so I'm not surprised that he would want to distance himself from that crowd.  His arguments hinge on our accepting him as a rationalist who through honest research has reached the conclusions expressed in Against Method.

So your point is that those Jews should have just accepted that they lived in countries that were going to kill them and shut up about it. 

&gt;that doesn't justify taking a land that belongs to another people.

I am not sure what ""taking"" and what ""belonging"" you refer to. The Jews were not going door to door kicking out Arabs. And the land ""belong"" either to landowners, who sold to Jews, or to the Ottomans and then the British. In that case letting Jews in or not is a political position, not a moral point. The British changed their mind on Jewish immegration to Palestine because of Arab violence and a British decision to align with the Arabs. Not because somehow they decided that the Palestinians had some superior moral justification.

&gt;Also, i think one question that is very important is why didn't the Europeans and the U.S. allow Jews to immigrate into their respective countries?

But they had that right, isn't that part of your point? The Jews were not wanted anywhere, so they should have died in place.

The scholarship is based on the income on your parents (the more they make, the less you get). It ranges between €100 and €3500 per year (also based on how many courses you're taking. No minimal grade limit required). If you fail your first year you have a 're-orientation scholarship' of the same amount of money to start with a different study. If you fail your first year three times only operational costs (books, travel etc..) can be refunded. If you can't afford to rent a place near the university you can enroll in the 'dorm program' which will place you in student dorms with a rent also based on your parents income (between €78/month to a max of €250 a month). Privately held appartements and houses range between €200 and €600 for a more luxurious condo.

Students are motivated to enroll in the Erasmus Program which allows you to study abroad and get scholarships if they do so.


Student Loans do exists but are controlled by the gov with the university's help.

,1,"Everyone here has made extremely valid and true points and all I can really do is add.  
First off I've lived in Canada for 17 years now, my family immigrated here when I was 4, and the one thing that seems to stand out over all these years is *diversity* of quite literally everything.  
The west end of the country is completely different from the East for starters. You have the video game (and supposid weed) hub of Canada out in Vancouver. My best friend goes to UBC and all I hear about is gorgeous (fairly mild) weather with amazing scenery. There's a bit of cultural diversity out there but it's mostly whites, orientals, and aboriginals.  
In the middle of the country you have a lot of flat land, and to be honest when you hear of people moving to Canada from another country they usually don't go to Calgary (and sure as hell not Regina), but they're just another experience here. In the middle is flat flat flat flat land as far as the eye can see, and (I think anyway) has more of a small town feel even if Calgary is one of the larger cities in Canada. To be honest I don't know much more about the area. I had a friend who lived in Airdrie Alberta (just outside of Calgary) and the vibe I got was straight southern-style small town (without the religious fanatics).  
Then you come to Ontario. Anyone in Quebec will tell you Torontonians are a prudish work-driven bunch but you spend some time in the GTA and you'll learn otherwise. EVERYONE and EVERYTHING is accepted in Ontario (I'm going to mostly refer to Toronto and the GTA because that's where I live). It's a fun city with a VERY multicultural population (I'm talking quite literally everything you can imagine, Asians, Eastern Europeans, Regular Europeans, Africans, Middle Easterners, South Americans, and I swear to god each group has its own village within Toronto somewhere. The weather will hit lows of -30c with several feet of snow, and we get highs of 35c with blistering humidity. Then sometimes the sky will just open up and it'll rain for a week on end.  
Then you head out to Quebec, Hull, Montreal - French Canada. This whole place is basically the Europe of the west. Parties and cafe's and a very distinct night life and a very particular culture. And don't get me wrong, Quebec is a great place to raise a family too, it's not just for trendy hipsters. The weather out there is fairly similar to most of Ontario with a bit more precipitation. The land seems to have more character out there however. Parts of Ontario are very flat and green, but Quebec has some small hills and mountains lying all over the place. Montreal is built at the foot of a mountain, and so is Quebec City I believe.  
As for the maritimes I know very little. Basically like the middle of Canada you don't usually get people moving there from other countries. From what I know predominantly white population with some French interlaced with the English. Lots of water, lots of fish, lots of seafood, a lot like Maryland from what I've heard.  
Here's the thing about Canada though, it doesn't matter where you live because everyone everywhere is... well smart. Not saying you're not gonna run in to a few stupid people, but even our stupid people are kind of smart. Most places (I feel) are very liberal in their mindsets, and everyone sort of cares about each other to a degree. Even our conservative governments are in actuality pretty liberal on the scale. Almost everyone is weed friendly, Crime rates are way lower than anything you can imagine in America, being gay isn't even something anyone thinks about, there are very few religious fanatics and NONE like you hear about in America (WBC condemns Canada anyway). I honestly can keep going on like this. Yes, you will pay a lot in income tax, yes there are some downsides, the weather does get a bit extreme, and we have federal elections as often as we have halloween.

,309,"What surprises me about the US, as a European, is the duplicit way in which you appear (and I'm willing to be corrected here) to view your own society. On one hand, self-determination and autonomy are the values that seem to be most important to Americans - this is reflected in things such as private healthcare and gun ownership; essentially a notion that one's survival is primarily one's own responsibility. 

Conversely, there is an almost blind love for the flag and country; yet I've never been able to figure out why this love stops somewhere beyond the flag, yet short of your next door neighbour. Why is it seen as admirable to fight and die for your country (ie protecting the weaker), yet to support the unknown neighbour down the road and have him support you is something seen as detrimental?

Most bizarrely, however, is the almost utilitarian view taken towards work. Americans have so few rights as employees, yet some argue (and this seems to generally include those with the least rights and the least pay) that this is fundamentally important to a functional society. From an outsider it appears that a rule exists that it is ok to shaft those below you, but those above you must be accorded respect.

What isn't charity is when a politician appeals to your charitable instincts during his campaign, saying such things as ""If I'm elected, children will no longer have to go hungry!"" or other nice little sound bites like that.  He then gets elected, takes everyones money, squanders it on a bloated, inefficient, heartless bureaucracy that often times shafts the very people it was intended to create (i.e.- there was a post the other day here on reddit about how terrible homeless shelters are in New York, and one only has to look at the abject misery that many children in our foster children live through to see the problems in that system).  Then, when a challenger arises and says that the instituted system isn't helping people, that there is more crime now than there was ten years ago, that people aren't being helped with this program, and that the program is wasting everyone's time, energy, and money, the oh-so-generous man in office demonizes his opponent and says that he will take money away from orphans and hates the homeless.

The government is what we turn to to solve problems, so the neighbor down the street doesn't need our help, they just need to go to the government.

This type of indoctrination reaps rewards for the elite at the top. They have people that volunteer to go off and die in foreign lands to secure corporate profits. Absolutely amazing, especially if you're the one at the top pulling all the strings.

I'll disagree with you here. I have worked for some european companies and many coworkers were from europe (france in particular), so I can see both systems and enjoyed some benefits from both systems.

The thing about this system is that it rewards small businesses. I think it must be a monumental task to start a business in europe with all the labor laws.

,4,"European conquest of North America was brutal, but you're right: North America was sparsely populated with hunter-gatherer tribes. (Such societies have relatively small numbers because they have to be mobile.) Sedantary agrarian societies tend to amass much, much larger populations. In North America, this tended to happen in Mexico with Mayans and Aztecs. They actually had cities. Their cousins to the North—in what is now the United States—never evolved complex, city-based civilzations. So the populations were much, much smaller than they were in Mexico.

That said, ethnic cleansing happened and many people died—either through disease, warfare or outright starvation as whites kept pushing them farther and farther away from their traditional hunting lands. Cast out of lush fields and forests in, say, New York or Massachusetts, they found themselves in dusty, hot [and unliveable] Oklahoma or Texas. No trees, very little game and inhospitable temperatures = malnutrition and death. 

According to this source, the total Amerindian population of what is now the United States in 1500 was about 1,894,350! [Source: http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/110482975/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 ]

At the same time, in the Aztec lands of Mexico, ""...the population before the time of the conquest is estimated at 15 million."" 

So the city-based culture of the Aztecs had 15 times the population density of their hunter-gatherer cousins to the north.

To put in perspective how overcrowded the Aztecs were, the entire continent of Europe—from England to Russia—was only about 20 million in the same time-period.

,5,"I'll try and answer all of these but sorry if it gets a bit rambly:

* There is some difficulty in determining what starts the 5d &amp; 6d series. Since as you correctly noted La and Ac have no f-electrons it would be wrong to call them f-elements and put them at the start of the f-block but at the same time they don't really fit correctly in Group 3 if you take them out of the f-block (as in [here](http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/periodic-table4.png)). If you look at periodic trends (atmoic radius, I.E, Melting Point) it would make more sense for Group 3 to be: Sc, Y, Lu, Lr as putting La in place of Lu throws the trends off when compared to later groups (Gp 14: Ti, Zr, Hf). So La and Ac don't really belong in either which is why I think they are quite interchangable. See Duckroll's post and [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table_%28wide%29) for more.

* I just had to double-back and check electronic compositions and you are right, Th does not have f-electrons either. I can't really shed any light on why it appears in the f-block other than it needed to go there in order to make everything else fit. The periodic table is more of a compilation of different facts and figures, the underlying notion being electronic structure but certain things get shifted about to fit with the observed trends in more established areas of the table.

* The seemigly random electronic configuration of the f-elements does have good reason and I'll try to be concise. For the Lanthanides I assume you're happy with the Aufbau principle predicting Ce as 4f*`2`*6s*`2`* so the trend is to fill f all the way up to Eu 4f*`7`*6s*`2`*. Gd is much like Cr where you see a preference for 5 d-electrons. In this case 7-electrons are a nice stable configuration as half of the shell is filled and no electrons have to be paired in the same orbital at an energy cost; so for Gd, instead of having 8 electrons in 4f, one electron is moved to the 5d orbital producing a more stable configuration 4f*`7`*5d*`1`*6s*`2`*. For Tb, two electrons in d would have more of an energy penalty than two paired f-electrons so it goes back to filling f all the way to the end where Lu is 4f*`14`*5d*`1`*6s*`2`* and it is here why you can see it follows similar trends to the lighter d*`1`* elements and vies with La for placement under them.

* The Actinides get more complicated as the nuclei are now massive. 5f orbitals undergo indirect orbital expansion as a result of the s (and p) orbitals contracting due to their exposure to the massive charges on the nuclei causing them to approach the speed of light. This raises the energy of the 5f orbital therefore lowers the 5f-6d separation which is why at the start of the Actinide series there is 1 d-electron instead of an extra f-electron. As for Lr, my guess is that 7p is simply lower in energy than 6d at this point so the extra electron goes in that (possibly due to the orbital expansion/contraction again: weaker contraction for p and weaker expansion for d but it might be enough to flip the energies of 7p*`1`* and 6d*`1`*)

You said that personal anecdotes are not evidence, while posting an article which was nothing but personal anecdotes.  I pointed this out.  

As to the stats in the article:

&gt; Per capita income is a valid economy wide statistic, and supporters of poor Scandinavia always use it to show the alleged prosperity of people there. I was simply doing the same.

Very well.  Norway has a higher per capita income.  [Wikipedia](http://bit.ly/193E8H)  Look back at the article and note that the article *completely excluded* this fact and instead presented statistics from other countries (in a study conducted by a libertarian think tank), and then compared those countries with his personal anecdotes about how Norway has stingy bartenders.

&gt; ""It (a study by KPMG) indicated that when disposable income was adjusted for cost of living, Scandinavians were the poorest people in Western Europe.""

The only thing this concludes is that Scandinavia taxes much higher (disposable income=after tax income) than the rest of Europe, which isn't disputed or terribly interesting, since everyone knows that.

&gt; ""While the private-consumption figure for the United States was $32,900 per person, the countries of Western Europe (again excepting Luxembourg, at $29,450) ranged between $13,850 and $23,500, with Norway at $18,350.""

Does the above figure mean that Norway is less well off?  Not really, just that less of Norway's (higher) GDP per capita is spent on private consumption.  America spends more money on cars, household appliances, etc., while Norwegians spend less.  This could be explained in any number of ways: America has a culture of conspicuous consumption while Norwegians are more modest.  It perhaps simply means that this is part of the tradeoff for a more generous social safety net, universal and cheaper per capita healthcare (and better performance on most all measures of public health), a secondary educational system that performs better than America's, and a much cheaper university system.

Certainly everything you said is true of the past but you really don't appreciate the speed at which China has changed.

Just sent a text to my wife to check on the pledge thing  ** edit she just replied and said they don't (she is a form teacher in a middle school) **,  I've never heard it myself or seen saluting the flag, but there are 100s of thousands of schools in China, so it is quite likely different things are common place in different areas. To be honest I wouldn't be too surprised about saluting the flag, but these days China does not promote the communist philosophy. I would be very surprised if the word is even used in schools except as in a historical context, everything is ""Socialism"" these days. 

I have seen plenty of Chinese text-books. No they are not all tinged with revisionism. Most of them are just text books, but sadly some of their accounts of modern history differ in places from what I believe is true. However many Chinese are at least aware of this. 

You would probably be surprised to learn that there is a lot less censorship in China than you probably think there is. Yes there are Internet blocks, (reddit is not blocked obviously) but I have pretty much never found a major foreign news story that wasn't known to my colleagues. Domestic news stories will get local coverage but may not get into the national press. Nowadays there a many more newspaper stories that are critical of government at least at the local level. I was even watching a major television drama where one of the characters, a good guy, was a corrupt city official who knew he was going probably to prison for taking bribes from a construction company. It was set in a fictional city but the back-drop was Shanghai. That drama also had a couple of really positive foreign characters, who spoke good Chinese and were generous and understanding of Chinese culture.

As a nation strong dislike of the Japanese is common, but I know plenty of Japanese people in China and the locals treat them politely and with respect like they would any other visitor. The reasons for the dislike of the Japanese as a country (rather than individuals) is the same as many Europeans still vocally hate the Germans. Simply the Japanese were the aggressors in a very brutal war against many of their neighbors. The difference between the Germans and the Japanese has been that when the Germans apologized for the war, they really sound like they meant it. The Japanese have technically apologized many times but if you read the text there is nothing along the lines of ""we are really sorry that we cut open pregnant women in front of their families, performed vivisection experiments on prisoners, and widely used sex slaves"". Their apologies are dry and technical. These omissions have caused ill feeling towards japan and not just in China. I have actually got several Japanese friends who came over here to teach, sort of to help make amends, but I have also met Japanese people in China who basically say their country never did anything wrong.
There are old people tottering along the street outside my window who were eye-witnesses to what Japan did in this area (I live near Nanjing)

Finally not all Chinese hate the Japanese, plenty of young Chinese learn Japanese, are interested in the culture and think history should be left in the past.

The Tibetan issue is complicated, anyone who thinks it is simple is a fool. I won't discuss it here in detail but I can guarantee that Tibet won't get independence, and the more other countries put pressure on China the worse the situation will get. Can you image a free Tibet that allowed America to place a missile base on the Tibetan plateau? I am pretty sure the Chinese can. This is only one small aspect of a complex story that started with the Yuan dynasty. You are not ever going to convince a Chinese person that Tibet hasn't been part of their country for 700years. I have heard all the arguments, I am quite sympathetic to the Tibetan cause, but in the end it will have no effect on anything. This is the hardest brick wall in history there is no moving it.

Now on to something I know more about. Employment law, I know about this because in 2008 I was running my own company and then the Employment law changed in China to dramatically increase workers rights.
(wikipedia_article)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Employment_Law]

The law could be improved, but it contains some important provisions. For example employers must pay severance pay of one month's pay for every year worked when laying off workers. Contracts must specify health-care provisions, public insurance contributions etc etc. Courts will enforce these laws and many cases have been successfully brought against companies. I strongly suggest you research Chinese employment law before you say there are no workers rights.

On health care, China is a relatively poor country with 1.3billion citizens. It will be sometime before a free health-care system would be possible. However laws are in place and actively enforced to ensure that the price of important drugs and critical health-care procedures (Like maternity services) are capped to ensure they remain within the reach of even the poorest. 

I have fallen Ill here a couple of times, and a course of injections, anti-virals and drips over a period of a week, set me back $60. China is a nation of savers and I can guarantee 99% of the population have enough put by to cover common medical emergencies. In China you can always find a friend, or family member to lend you money, (for medicine, to buy a house whatever) people always help out their family and school-friends and always pay back the money as soon as they can, you would be considered a pretty worthless individual if you didn't. 

I'll also say that medical services are abundant here. I live in a small city in an province most people have never heard of, but there are community medical centers everywhere for common procedures like dispensing antibiotics. There are 5-6 major public hospitals and then there are a whole bunch of private hospitals. This is not a major city or a rich area but I can confidently say that health care is well within reach of most people who need it. I would certainly say that the situation is nowhere near as bad as you are portraying.

China is a very fast developing country. Quality of life is improving in all areas, I hear well informed discussions wherever I go. I see a lot of spending of public project that benefit people. My city just got a massive new park and an opera house is being built opposite Walmart.

All I am trying to get across is that your views are out of date and need constant revision. I would be happy to answer your questions based on my personal experiences.

The amusing thing for me in your response is that I was applying for permanent residency in Canada, for some of the reasons he mentioned.  Canada scores potential immigrants and I have the things that make it easier to move there. Now I have a fantastic job in the U.S. that I could never get in Canada. I'm stuck in the U.S. until it implodes. I'd rather not be. 

I'm so worried about some of the things he mentioned that I and my spouse (whose parents immigrated) are looking into getting some kind of joint citizenship. It is very difficult though.

My point was that he's comparing the U.S. to the developed world. There is a way the U.S. is worse even than the underdeveloped world. Americans are overworked and overstressed.  People immigrate to the U.S., yes. But I can't even count the times immigrants from Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, etc. tell me they hate the U.S. and they were happier and better off where they came from. Americans tend to be unhappy and neurotically anxious. They are often lonely as well because of the lack of social support.

The one thing in the article I thought was ridiculous though was his discussion of environmental damage and oil dependence. This is common throughout the world. China has horrific environmental damage in some areas. So does Eastern Europe. But the U.S. has shitty environmental regulations in comparison to Europe and New Zealand.

Egypt has a right to close it's border. Israel has a right to close it's border.

Israel has NO right to Close Gaza's sea border or air access.

Gettit?

Once more for luck?

Any country has a right to close its border. Its not always moral, and I dont Agree with Egpyt stance but I understand it. They have made a choice and have that right. What they cannot do is close off another countries borders. That's called a blockade. That is what Israel is doing.
That is why Israel is responsible for Gaza.

Another angle. Three houses in a row. The center one is Gaza.

The one on the left. ""The center one cannot pass across my yard to get out.""
The one on the right. ""The center one cannot pass across my yard, Nor can it use its front or rear doors to get out"".

The one on the right is the one blockading the center one.

Has that sunk in?

A few details for those that want to look into this deeper.

the border agreement between Israel and Egypt regarding the Gaza and Egpyt border is very tight and monitored by the US and tied to $1.3B of aid the US give Egypt.  
There isn't much point in Israel blocking all access in and out of GAZA then leaving the Egypt /Gaza border wide open is there? IT was tied up before Israel left GAZA. 
 

[**A New Reality on the Egypt-Gaza Border**](
http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=2374)


On September 1, 2005, following lengthy negotiations, Egypt and Israel signed the Agreed Arrangements Regarding the Deployment of a Designated Force of Border Guards along the Border in the Rafah Area (the Agreed Arrangements). This agreement was designed to enable Israel to evacuate the Philadelphia corridor, an eight-mile (thirteen-kilometer) military zone along the Gaza-Egypt border, through the deployment of Egyptian border patrol forces to the Egyptian side of the border in order to prevent smuggling into Gaza. In eighty-three clauses, the agreement describes the mission, weaponry, infrastructure, and obligations of the parties


Whats more [as this congressional report mentions ](http://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL34346.pdf) Israel has not only exaggerated the threat posed by weapons smuggling, but is deliberately acting to “sabotage” U.S.-Egyptian relations by demanding that the United States condition its annual $1.3 billion in military assistance on Egypt’s efforts to thwart smuggling
A bit more info: [The Rafah Terminal Crossing](http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL34346.pdf)
The Rafah crossing point is the only non-Israeli army-controlled access point
for Palestinians to leave Gaza. When Israel unilaterally withdrew from the Gaza Strip
in 2005, Secretary of State Rice helped broker an agreement (“The Agreement on
Movement and Access”) between Israel, Egypt, and the Palestinian Authority to
provide Gazans access through the Rafah terminal. Israel agreed to allow the
European Union to maintain a Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM) to monitor the
Rafah crossing. Without a physical presence on the border, Israel monitored the
checkpoint using closed-circuit cameras. **Most importantly, Israel retained the power
to open and close the crossing based on its assessment of the security situation.**
After Hamas took over the Gaza Strip in June 2007, Egypt worked with Israel
to close the Rafah crossing. According to the last EUBAM factsheet, “Since Corporal
Gilad Shalit was captured [by Hamas] on 25 June 2006, the Rafah Crossing Point
(RCP) has been closed for normal operations and open on an exceptional basis only.

I would first and foremost recommend that you become a member of [couchsurfing](www.couchsurfing.org]. Not only can you meet some really great people, get local advice on places to go and things to see, but it's a free place to stay. 

Second, check out the local cheap airlines, ryanair, easyjet...you can find flights as low as 0.01 pounds (before taxes). The train isn't a bad way to experience Europe, it's just expensive. The travel between locations will probably be the most expensive part of your trip. So, that's a decision you'll have to make. 

Also, make sure to look for free bikes. Many big cities have 'green bike' programs. Public bikes that you pick up, ride and drop off. In Lausanne, Switzerland, where I live at the moment, you put a down a deposit on the bike, and get the money back when you return it. (This would be an alternative to paying for local public transport). 

Something to consider as well would be hitchhiking. Obviously this comes with a certain amount of risk, but in all my experiences here, I have never had a problem. Tips: Just smile in a friendly way as a car passes, stick your thumb out, looking more directly at the driver.   
My boyfriend has a mohawk and we still get picked up. I find we have better luck in the mountain/rural communities than down in the cities.

,1,"Hi Tybris, appreciate your direct and honest comment. Standard of living. All indexes that tried to move away from GDP to reflect quality of life ended up mirroring GDP. Could you state what std of living means for you. I guess there is something about space/wilderness in the Pac NW that you don't have in the Netherlands, but do in many other European countries. Electronics goods are far cheaper in America than in other western economies. Single market, economies of scale. Unfortunately the EEC hasn't won on that yet!! The cost of the EEC bureaucracy must be phenomenal and remove any gains from a better integrated Europe. I agree on the material / consumer aspects of US society. Are they significant (paying more/less range irritates me but doesn't really mitigate std of life outcomes) - I am surprised you find them so.
However, do you fear the police in the US? Or at least have the same view of them as in NL/D/B/Fr? Walk the streets as easily as you do in NL? Do you think there is an educational differentiation between US and NL? For eg. NL has the largest number of private company start ups in Europe. Considered an entrepreneurial society. I understand societal education in NL and much of western Europe is higher than the US.
As you are in business you state US business is better, why? They get (being English speakers) cream from Europe, GB, Australia, South Africa etc and higher quality/sophistication ensues? New blood. It is hard for foreigners to choose NL as a destination, language, climate and limited geography make it difficult for new people. (Dutch academic institutions though do very well with foreign academics visiting/sabbaticals/contributing. Having lived in Europe for 20 yrs, other western economies for about the same and a few years in and out of the US (some on business) the quality of many individual Americans is impressive. I don't think they are in numbers sufficient to overcome the negatively recrudescent spiral that corporatism, American urbanism,  poor social educational levels and the limited outlook its populace creates. Also American makes much capital /wealth from intimidating smaller countries eg South American, African states and other western economies - threatened Australia with sanctions if it did not permit the USA to cripple its film industry and maintain cuckoo status. This will occur less as China takes over that role. Britain's net invisibles were huge because of its foreign controls.
American corporatism since the Bush/Cheyney regime has fundamentally destroyed creative business development and follows a robber / standover mentality because the cake is no longer sufficiently growing. When there isn't economic growth one becomes tougher so as to take what you perceive you need (a la Mancur Olson.)

But as for finding records of that time, I think it would be rather difficult. From what I gather through articles like [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_of_Germans_after_World_War_II), the expulsion of ethnic Germans from all over Europe was rushed, chaotic, and rife with acts of victimization by those doing the expelling; so due to all of those, it would seem like those doing the expelling wouldn't be as good with keeping records as they should, or if they did keep records but also committed crimes to the ethnic Germans they were expelling, it makes sense that they would destroy any related records that would make those crimes verifiable. 

And from what I gather, the expulsions varied very widely in how they were done and how fair/brutal they were. Like Hungary, they only did expulsions when forced to by the international agreement, and even then, they didn't separate mixed German/Hungarian families. Though in the Netherlands they did separate families, removing the ethnic German members. Though the worst of it was in the region that was the former far eastern part of Germany. (and other ethnic minorities were expelled during what was done to Germans in the couple years following the war, Ukrainians, Italians, and I think a few others; something ironic about the post-war push for ethnically pure nation-states, wonder where they got *that* idea from...)

I do hope that as the World War 2 generation dies off, and this becomes the stuff of historians, that more will come to light and we'll learn more about what exactly happened. This seems to be the case, looking at how much info is available now on the subject compared to 7-8 years ago when I first looked. I'm not sure what the odds are that you will be able to find records of what happened to your ancestors, but I *am* fairly confident that you'll be able to find an account of what happened in their village/town, or at least what happened in a nearby village/town/city.

,7,"&gt;But you talk about legal and illegal like that actually means something.

Yes, of course I do.

What you've now gone from saying is that Israel is not being unreasonable to Israel just takes what it wants but that's okay because nobody can hold them accountable.  Not the same thing.  You've completely changed tac.

You've gone from arguing the blockade as legal - quite vehemently too, to completely surrendering that defense and saying it's only an intellectual exercise because they can do what ever they want.

Well, no.  They can't and Israel is realising that.  It's starting to feeling the reprisals.

People are holding them accountable.  They're looking at the blockade and saying 'No'.  From this one flotilla Israel has already lost an ally, a planned natural gas pipeline and a fresh water program.  Israel is not resource rich.  Their economy is based on agriculture, technology, finance and tourism.  Tourism is huge and a major component of their economy.  In the first half of 2009 following Israel's catastrophic PR tourism was down over 20% on the previous year.  No matter what figures the Israeli government tells the Tourist Board to put out - this has burnt them.

Now you have to look at what Israel needs.  They already know that gone are the days of the 1990s where the Israel lobby in the US was taboo.  Everyone knows about it.  During Op CastLead there were major protests in most major cities across Europe.  That means that governments can't be lent on as heavy by these lobbyists.  They now have the popular people lobby.  It's getting easier to speak out and to act.  Israel also needs US support and their veto.  That relationship is changing.  [People are talking about it.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/may/26/postamericanisrael) They need migration because they're facing a demographic time bomb.  The real threat is when moderate dual Israel citizens start to leave because of Israel's lurch to the authoritarian right.  All these things are being effected and brought about.  Israel's never had great PR but the last few years a corner somewhere has been turned.  They're pepper-pottering their public persona from disaster to crisis and back again.

Israel is slowly being constrained much as South Africa was over apartheid.  Funny you should mention South Africa yourself.  It's very much alike. Isolation led to a choice: change our ways and survive or stay the same and watch the country collapse in on itself.

If people keep protesting.  If the humanitarian flotillas keep sailing.  If the spotlight is kept on Israel's attrocities then governments will find they have no  political capital to keep backing Israel.  It will stop being expedient for them - the regime in Israel is well on its way to being a burden for the few friends it still has.

Nice bit of implied Holocaust denial there. Sorry, but the Jewish ghettos were a Christian creation for centuries. The Warsaw Ghetto was used as a storage place for people on their way to the Death Camps. There is no reasonable similarity to Gaza. The Gaza blockade is a *response* to deadly violence from Hamas targeted against Israeli *civilians*.

Indeed they do: until recently Sweden's been pretty monocultural and a consequence has been a degree of xenophobia and racism, especially to groups thought *particularly* different from traditional Swedes.

Along come several waves of immigration by Muslims. Swedes, on the whole being reasonable people, try to accommodate new immigrants by adapting to the new and at first unfamiliar *multiculturalism*.

Many of the newly arrived and then second and then 3rd generation of Muslims harbour a traditional Muslim antipathy to Jews, and foment  new waves of antisemitism. 

So non-Muslim Swedes may feel ambivalent about their Muslim countrymen, expressing that at the periphery in out-and-out racism directed at Muslims; and some Muslims make common cause with traditional antisemitism to make life difficult for Swedish Jews.

And the ""debate"" about this is light entertainment for me, at best.

The political fight is important, of course.  But I don't think the ""debate"" connects with the political fight as much as I think it once did.   Even as a minority, a well organized, strategic political movement is probably going to be more effective (at least in the United States) than a disorganized, weak political movement which represents a hypothetical anti-gun majority.  What must steam the Brady people is how ineffective they are at getting people to the voting booth the way the NRA does.

It is why with all their flaws and even occasional treachery, I think the single best thing a person can do - if we look at the net effects on their rights when all is said and done - is to join the National Rifle Association.

I have heard and understand a lot of the objections to the NRA, and that need not be the only thing a person gets involved with, but, on balance, a principled pro-gun lobbying organization which has minor pull is less effective in protecting my rights than a compromised one with a lot of pull.  

And the NRA has a lot - orders of magnitude, perhaps (on the federal level) over the next most famous group, GOA.  Ideally, one would be members of both.  (I am a member of the AzCDL, a bafflingly effective state lobbying group here in Arizona which has pulled countless rabbits of out of their hat, legislatively.  I salute them most of all.)

But it is as if, in many countries, the more you roll over and just let bad people go rampaging through the streets, and the less willing you are to defend yourself, and the more you back down from every fight, the more enlightened and modern you are.

Sacrificing your right to defend yourself and prostrating yourself before a government which is at best incompetent in protecting people and at worst not on your side is not enlightened.  I've tried to admire this brand of pacifism, and I can't.  No matter how I try to read it as philosophically principled, all I see is weakness masquerading as sophistication.  

It is historically stupid, and a demonstration of nothing more than being milquetoast - one forgivable as a personal choice when it is you, personally, but one less forgivable when it is a surrender which also enables the snuffing out of innocent lives around you - maybe your own family.  

It is as if people find a comfort in submission to violence and evil.  By insisting they can do nothing (note the insistence so many have on attacking the efficacy of firearms for self defense - it is not even that they believe it but that they desperately need this to be true to have a perfect, non-contradictory list of reasons for pushing submission), there is peace in surrender, as the terminally ill patient eventually accepts and surrenders to death.  It is as if Europeans want nothing more than to go gently into that good night.  

How am I supposed to look at a man who thinks it would be better to submit to an armed criminal in his own home, endangering the lives of his wife and children, and who berates me for being some kind of impetuous cowboy who has seen too many movies for insisting on my right and duty to take a stand?  I can only regard such a man with contempt, the way I regarded people - even myself at times - who didn't stand up for themselves in schoolyards.  I am not a tough guy at all.  But I know enough to despise my own weakness and, at times, cowardice.  I know enough to understand that good men must make a stand.  Men like Orwell and Kipling and Churchill understood this too.  I don't know what softened Britain up so much, but it is disappointing because I expect so much more.  Enlightenment and civilization are the products of good men speaking softly and carrying, when necessary, a big stick.  They are not the product of rolling over and submitting to those who seek to destroy civilization, order, and decency by preying on the innocent.

The faith people have in their governments, and for fate to work in their favor is less childlike than it is childish.   I'm talking about the ""grinch"" moment, like in the cartoon where mean Mr. Grinch looks into the eyes of a peaceful person and his heart swells, and he decides to do no more wrong.  I honestly get the sense that people encountering a carjacker or home invader believe that this is all that is required to get the perpetrator to experience this moment of peace, love, and understanding.  Part of me wishes this was true, but I would think that adults by this point would really know it isn't.

In the end, what irritates me about the debate is the sanctimoniousness of those who state proudly that they'd rather not resist in the face of an attack, and that somehow this is an attitude I should respect, like they're Christians walking into the mouths of lions or something.  

Fortunately, this is not an attitude which has purchase in the United States to the degree it does in Europe, and I will fight like hell that it never does.  There is much I admire about Europe, and there is much, especially in the UK, that I think I would like.

,1,"That won't be allowed. Putting on my tin foil hat for a second, here's why:

Everything that runs in this world runs because of banks. The Warburg, Rockefeller, Kissinger families, as well as a few other lesser known ones started this system. Quoting Wikipedia: 

""At the end of November 1910, Senator Nelson W. Aldrich and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Department A.P. Andrews, and 5 more of the country's leading financiers, who together represented about one-fourth of the world's wealth[citation needed], arrived at the Jekyll Island Club to discuss monetary policy and the banking system, an event which some say was the impetus for the creation of the Federal Reserve.""

This happened almost 100 years ago, November of this year. With the creation of the American Federal Reserve system, it put the entire country into the debt of the banks, and that debt must be repaid somehow. This system systematically stretched out its arms and became the IMF around 30 years later. 

Basically, what they have set up 100 years ago they won't let be undone. Any opposition to them will be halted. When JFK was assassinated, he proposed to bring back the Gold Standard, meaning using *real*, Gold money that is not subject to inflation, and because of that the banks would hold no power over the US. So, he was assassinated.

Slowly the world has started to form into a collective government in the effort of peace and prosperity. The [League of Nations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations) was formed as a test run for a bigger scale operation. It eventually failed and became the UN Council. Later, the [EU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union#History) was created. The EU's monetary system is run by the IMF. Anyways, as you can see the world is slowly starting to form a collective, one government. The African Union is stretching its legs, but it is unimportant in the scale of things. There are other smaller Unions as well, but slowly they are becoming one unified group.

So, with this brief history lesson, I can tell you one thing with absolute certainty: No one is allowed to oppose this, the banks, or the process of unification. If you oppose it, you are a freedom hating terrorist, and you will be stopped. The easiest way is to dissuade people is to call them crazy conspiracy theorists, which usually stops most people. 

Why do you think that the G summits are held behind closed doors? Why is the Federal Reserve never audited? Simple questions, but with really complex answers.

So, in order to oppose this group of people who we don't even know, what they look like, or even their names, you would have to stop them at a base level and deconstruct them block by block, starting with the banks. Take down the financial sector on Wall Street, destroy the banking system, and you can start to destroy them. Then, destroy their oil supply. Without oil the world grinds to a halt, and their power grasp clenches to a small area for a long time. 

Maybe then you can oppose them.

Edit: Thought I would add some more. Below is the new stuff.

I'm going to start this off with a question, answer it before reading further please. Why is Washington driving itself into debt it can never repay?

Here's my answer. It has to. In order to keep up its military industrial complex growing, and to keep control on its people, it must drive itself further into debt. The Patriot Act is an example of control the government is trying to achieve. Once the US fully collapses, a new system will have to be set up to regain control of the idiot masses. That is what the Government is trying to achieve: The 1930's all over again. 2008 was just the tip of the iceberg, a preview of what is to come. Why would a government be so backwards towards its people? Because it isn't the US President who is calling the shots. If that isn't apparent to people nowadays, I can assume they live under a rock and never vote. 

buildingrage posted this on this page: ""This fucking government is driving me crazy. They don't understand shit about finance. I try to tell them they can't spend their way out of debt. But do these brain dead fuckers in Washington give a shit? Fuck no."". They *fully* understand what they are doing. The individual cogs in the machine don't know their purpose, but the machine is being beautifully orchestrated in a different, overarching direction. There will be no revolution against this system, that is what Martial Law is for; a complete grasp of control instantly by the military at the direction of the President.

Edit 2: Doesn't this all sound like [Metal Gear](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid)? Of course it does. Now, I hope this doesn't invalidate my previous writing because it is a video game. I play games, I make games, and I am pretty sure Kojima knows exactly what he is talking about. Let us relate a few facts between reality and fiction. The Patriots in the game are the ones calling the shots, much like the people behind closed doors are pulling the strings. The Patriots *s*elect the President of the United States, much like the president is s*elected* every 4 years. The Patriots one and only goal is to have a unified world government, much like the current shadow figures have that in mind. The Patriots also produce a system of ID tracking every single person through nanomachines; this is almost identical to what is being proposed through tracking, a chip in the hand to start, or a pill that floats in the blood stream. Yeah, some heavy conspiracy stuff right there, I know that.

In the history of the game, the Patriots were initially set up as [The Philosophers](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/The_Philosophers), which had access to most of the worlds money in the form of [The Philosophers Legacy](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/The_Philosophers); identical to what happened at Jekyll Island 100 years ago in reality. They soon branched out and had control over the many military's of the world, the production of medicine (Like the Rockefeller family has now over our own Pharmaceutical production), and created wars to fuel their power and to drive countries into the dirt. Does this sound familiar?

Now, this is a strange coincidence, and a really, really funny one at that, but the Gulf of Mexico's oil spill resembles the [Big Shell Incident](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Big_Shell_Incident) in Metal Gear Solid 2. In the game the spill took place in 2007, and the cleanup was ongoing into 2009. It was known in the game as the worst environmental disaster in history. Close to home, hm? Now, this was used to create a new Metal Gear, ordered by the Patriots, in reality that won't be happening. Still, pretty fucking funny how good of a guess Kojima made in 2001.

- Alcohol legislation is ridiculous. The tax is enormous, quoting from another page ""a bottle of Absolut vodka might retail for the equivalent of €37, €31 of which is pure tax.""

Grocery shops are allowed to sell beer, cider and those sodas with tiny amounts of vodka 4.5% between opening and 8 in the evening on weekdays. 6 in the evening on Saturdays.

I guess I was writing to redditors in general but more specifically to  mr/mrs Alikese who was expressing certain views. I think that some people believe that censorship in China is to a point where all information is controlled. That people can't say anything without fear of consequences and that they are unaware of anything much in the wider world. Which is not true.

The fact is that even though books like 1984 are officially banned, I can walk into many bookshops here and pick up a copy. A friend of mine tried to hand out copies in a university class and the students weren't interested because they had already read it.

I have had plenty of conversations about politics here and the people who what to inform themselves seem pretty informed on most modern and historical issues.

News coverage of the recent British election seemed fair and accurate for example and I find in conversations with people like taxi drivers many have a far better idea of foreign politics than I would expect a western taxi-driver to have of Asian politics.

So my point was that there is more information available and access to alternative view points in China than Alikese probably imagines.

You are right that there is a massive apparatus of censorship in place and it is getting more sophisticated. But the most effective type of censorship is the type you impose on yourself and this is also the most effective type in China. Things that people just don't want to publicize.

The idea that any Chinese person doesn't know about the cultural Revolution and what went on is not really very realistic. I mean for people of a certain age that is what they talk about, it is like swapping old war stories. ""when I was sent to the country..."". 

My wife's mother decided she want to go as see Mao, she and some of her friends got on a train (which were all free at the time) and took the 900km Journey to Beijing. Some got scared and turned back, but she and a friend carried on. By the time they got to the capital they were both pretty sick from the cold and needed to be hospitalized (again free), finally they got to Tiananmen and saw Mao in the distance on a balcony, and eventually got home to their small town (end story). She was also sent to the country for a couple of years, I showed her some travel pics of Guilin and she got all excited and said ""Oh that's like where I was sent to the country"".

However her view and most other people I talked to is still that the cultural revolution was a bad thing. Just like old Europeans may swap war stories, they enjoy the camaraderie and memories of adventures when they were young, but they wouldn't like to live through it again.

Stories like this, good bad and terrifying are swapped everyday by old people playing Mahjong all over China. The point is that making a museum about it is the last thing they are going to do, because this would be a center of the whole country losing face. Not many Chinese people are going to be happy with a museum that highlights how they all got caught up in a whirlwind of stupidity which put the country behind by decades and destroyed countless lives and historical artifacts. This is the kind of thing Europeans do but it is a cultural difference.

Mao is still on the bills because he was kind of a pivotal figure. You could claim he was an evil man with some justification. You could claim he didn't really beat the Japanese and maybe that is true.You could claim that he made huge and costly mistakes. However China had gone through nearly 300 years of foreign rule under the Qing, who had also allowed European powers to control huge areas, after the end of the Qing dynasty the country was massively fractured with areas under warlord control and then the Japanese invaded. Somehow through fair means or foul Mao built a single country out of that mess, whatever he did at least gave people the ability to say ""I am Chinese and I am ruled over by other Chinese"" which they hadn't been able to say for 300 years. So whatever your view on him he has a pretty unique role in modern Chinese history. Chinese people seem to entertain a complex view of him, westerners are much more black and white in our thinking. Oh and I think he was left off the 10yuan olympic commemorative bill as well :-). 

On the CCP please don't forget that something like 7% of the population of the country is a paid up party member but also that plenty of people in government positions are not actually party members. You can have teachers in the party because they think in the long run it will give them a career leg up and city officials who were either never party members or let their membership lapse.

I have met some city level government leaders when discussing projects. They are competent town planners and administrators, they have qualifications after their names in things like urban development, they are on a career ladder that may take them to province level administration in 5 years time. 

China is run like a massive corporation, with innumerable departments different levels of autonomy in different regions, baffling bureaucracy, overlapping areas of responsibility, ass covering and buck passing, and in amongst  it all 1.3 billion people going about their daily lives without much interference from the state. Defining whether that system is somehow good or evil just seems ridiculous to me in its oversimplification. It seems pretty ridiculous to think that all the roads, schools, hospitals, universities huge investment in public services, millions of trees being planted (every street in my city for example)  are all some manifestation of some underlying evil plan. I also don't really think that Beijing can possibly know what is going on all over China. Beijing can only set targets, make policies, define plans, try to standardize things. You can't micro manage a country of that size.

I can not say the Chinese government is benevolent or malevolent just that quantitatively many things which affect people's daily lives have improved through public spending and sensible planning. Little things like provision of housing, deepening of sewers, improved public spaces, new public buses with TV and air-conditioning, new schools and financial aide to poorer students. But also huge things like currently subway networks are being built in 12 cities, new universities are being built with campus populations bigger than some small western cities.

Of course the Chinese government wouldn't like to see urban unrest. I get on the bus in the morning and the thought of all these people getting pissed off at the same time scares the shit out of me. When things kick off in a bar fight in China they really kick off, the veneer of polite civilization gets dropped and people get bottles smashed over their heads. 

Interestingly, once more some Chinese people have a more complex view of censorship, than thinking it is just ""bad"". I was talking to a friend about the recent attacks on children in schools. We discussed some of the reasons behind it and they said they thought the later attacks were basically copycats of the first and that the later people had seen how the first guy had suddenly achieved his 15 minutes of fame (although basically in an act of suicide) and decided they wanted to go the same way. My friend actually said that if they just didn't report these things then it would have saved a lot of lives. I didn't comment, but I think it illustrates the idea of controlling the press for the public good has a lot more acceptance here. Of course to a western audience that is a pretty terrible thing to say but you kind of need to leave your assumptions on the plane when you get to China.

The ghost whisperers are scared that the Internet is the tool of the devil where young impressionable minds are being stolen from them by the means of science (a tool of Satan) and reason (the whore of babylon).

I put it to you, that you do NOT have to wait for the future to see the filter used to filter political speech.

Euthanasia, Terrorism INFORMATION, Drug INFORMATION can all already be blocked. All Political. When Censorship was my hobby, I found that fully 2/3rd of materials refused classification had *NOTHING* to do with porn as most people would expect, instead they were under 'ADULT THEMES' a category which included Suecide, Euthanasia, Drug information. Porn is just a bugbear used by the Government with ill intent because they are FULLY aware its not about porn. However if they use porn as the stick, it had two benefits;

a) It makes ANY defender of free speech look like a Pedofile, because why else would they be against a technology that keeps the internet 'clean'. At least in the eyes of the dumb voting sheep who sadly form 70+% of the voting public.

b) It moves the debate away from rational debate. Many cant even debate politiely when 'shameful' shit is involved. It allows the Government to hijack the debate by ignoring Euthanasia, Terrorism INFORMATION and Drug debate.

NB: Blocking Terrorsim information sounds like a great idea but it includes organisations such as Hamas (who are actually a legitimately elected government in Gaza) and Tamil Tigers (an independence movement in East Timor) both organisations prescribed Terrorist by Australian law (and with Hamas at least by the UN). 

Many say 'Terrorists to be recognised must give up violence and sit around the table and join political process', but with Hamas that clearly is not a goer (in part no doubt to Australian and US governments and to lesser degree Europeans being beholded to the very influential Jewsih lobbies). By blocking 'Terrorist' information, there is no debate, only 500 pound 'precision' bombs. Cycle of violence continues. Miliary Complex profits. 

In a Democracy we deride and dismiss flawed idea (such as terrorism) we do not block it. By blocking it we show it as threat, something we can not deal with.

What you say about what's happened in our generation is somewhat true.  It's not so much that the third world has caught up, it's that capitalism has developed their labor markets, whereas before they were not.  This has left first-world workers as less valuable to profit than third world workers.  And when we're impoverished enough, and US and European workers have a quality of life more in line with the enslaved worker of southeast Asia, the jobs will come back, and leave someone else's economy in shambles.  And so on and so on it goes.

This is precisely why capitalism must be abolished:  it is both a progressive and destructive force of economic and social organization.  It must be replaced with rational, planned economic development:  socialism.

I will leave the detailed nuances of Sharia to Muslim and Western scholars and theologians.

Sharia is subject to interpretation by the two main sects of Islam, the Sunni and the Shi’a, and different Muslim countries also have differing interpretations. 

Part One of this series explored the rapid spread of Muslims and Islam in Western Europe particularly where Muslims and the Muslim faith is inexorably gaining ascendancy and where it is already influencing life and public policy in that area of the world.

The power of Muslims and Sharia is also gaining strength in America although at a slower pace simply due to the breadth and population of our nation.

No, it does happen - your theory is disproved by unemployment figures, which are not linked to the success of automation but rather to the economic cycle. If unemployment effects were dominated by automation, we'd expect to see unemployment steadily increasing, not ramping up in a recession and ramping down in a boom.

Now, there's a case to be made that some of the jobs created during the last boom were built on fraud (e.g. people who arranged liar loans for illegal immigrants, or people who sold on these liar loans in the form of CDOs), and the fraudulent income generated by those was then somewhat recycled into the economy perhaps generating more unsustainable jobs, but I don't know how big that effect is.

Back to addressing 'illegal' are you?  Okay but if you keep throwing U-Turns like this people are going to start thinking you're using Reddit to do donuts.  Collective punishment is illegal - international bodies and political figures are and have been held to this standard before. In this regard the 'police' have been contacted i.e. the international community.  The EU has denounced the blockade and is working with the UN.  The Secretary General of the U.N. has denounced the blockade and Israel's actions.  The Arab states have contacted the U.N. asking for international action.   An investigation has been called for.  Effectively the police have been contacted.  The only difference now is the political landscape is dramatically changing and we're getting close to a position where the U.N. can act with Israel losing support with its main backers who usually stop them from being held accountable.

&gt;**That is one version of events.**

With considerably more reliable testimony.  We even have a video now of the ships taking casualties before commandos are seen to board.

&gt;&gt;Israel doesn't want to allow that, because they are trying to suffocate Gaza and keep Hamas militants angry and attacking. Because if they stop attacking, Israel can't ""retaliate"".

They offered to deliver part of the aid they decided to allow.  The humanitarians were trying to provide cement.  Israel won't deliver that.  It is a mark of solidarity by Hamas to stand with the humanitarians and Palestinians in not accepting the illegal blockade.

&gt;**Makes it all worthwhile really.**

It certainly does but sadly the cost has been incredibly high.  The authoritarian regime in Israel is more isolated than ever and there is massive momentum now from the international community to end the blockade once and for all.  Even Israel is now talking about how to allow the international community to manage the inspections under which conditions they can decide for themselves when banned items can be allowed in on a vis-a-vis decision as they see fit.  That means ending the blockade because all the humanitarian goods, including fresh meat and cement, would be allowed in.  Israel's already considering how to back down without losing more face.

Raid Illegal Under San Remo Manual

Israel claims that paragraph 67(a) of the San Remo Manual on Armed Conflicts at Sea justified the Israeli operation against the flotilla. (The San Remo Manual is an authoritative statement of international law applicable to armed conflicts at sea.)

Paragraph 67(a) only permits attacks on the merchant vessels of neutral countries where they ""are believed on reasonable grounds to be carrying contraband or breaching a blockade, and after prior warning they intentionally and clearly refuse to stop, or intentionally and clearly resist visit, search or capture"".

Israel argues that it gave due warnings, which were not heeded.

What Israel conveniently omits to mention is that the San Remo Manual also contains rules governing the lawfulness of the blockade itself, and there can be no authority under international law to enforce a blockade which is unlawful. Paragraph 102 of the Manual prohibits a blockade if ""the damage to the civilian population is, or may be expected to be, excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated from the blockade"".

The background to that ""proportionality"" rule is the experience of past world wars where naval blockades had devastating effects on civilian populations.

There is little question that Israel's blockade of Gaza is disproportionate in legal terms. The proportionality rule requires an assessment of the military advantage against the harmful effects on civilians. Israel claims that the blockade is necessary to prevent Hamas from mounting indiscriminate rocket attacks on Israeli civilians.

Such attacks were well documented by the UN's Goldstone Report and are a serious security threat to Israel. Israel has every right to protect its civilians from indiscriminate terrorist attacks by Hamas.

The proportionality principle requires, however, that Israel's security cannot come at any price. A balancing of interests is necessary to ensure that civilians should not pay too dearly for the security needs of others.

Safeguarding the precious lives of innocents and respecting their dignity as fellow humans is the necessary burden that international law imposes on war. That is why Israel reveals its contempt for international law when, for example in the past, its leaders have pledged to ""destroy 100 homes for every rocket fired"".
Gaza Blockade Itself Illegal

The harmful effects of the blockade on Gazan civilians have included the denial of the basics of life, such as food, fuel, and medicine, as well widespread economic collapse.

The UN agency on the ground, the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), has described a ""severe humanitarian crisis"" in Gaza in relation to human development, health, education, ""the psychological stress"" on the population, high unemployment (at 45 per cent) and poverty (with 300,000 people living beneath the poverty line), and the collapse of commerce, industry and agriculture.

Such effects are manifestly excessive in relation to Israel's security objectives and cannot possibly satisfy the conditions of a lawful blockade. Disrupting wildly inaccurate rockets from being fired at relatively underpopulated areas of southern Israel cannot possibly justify the acute disruption of the daily lives and livelihoods of more than one million Gazans. Nor is it lawful to seek to pressure Hamas by instrumentally impoverishing its civilian supporters.

It seems that Israel is the only entity incapable of recognizing the effects of its blockade. The United States, European Union and numerous independent sources have deeply criticized the disproportionate harm to Gazan civilians.

The UN Secretary General has condemned the ""unacceptable suffering"" caused by the blockade. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has criticized it for violating the law of armed conflict. The UN Human Rights Council, UN Humanitarian Affairs Coordinator, Oxfam, and Amnesty International have all strongly condemned it.

The UN's Goldstone Report found that blockade may even amount to international crimes: ""Israeli acts that deprive Palestinians in the Gaza Strip of their means of subsistence, employment, housing and water, that deny their freedom of movement and their right to leave and enter their own country… could lead a competent court to find that the crime of persecution, a crime against humanity, has been committed.""
Israel's Offers on Cargo Not Credible

Israel has further argued that it offered the Gaza flotilla an opportunity to deliver aid through the proper Israeli channels.

It is very difficult to regard that offer as sincere given Israel's track record. Israel's practices concerning the transit of goods through Israeli entry points has been arbitrary at best and deliberately obstructive at worst.

The UN notes that everything from crayons to soccer balls to musical instruments has been denied entry into Gaza - hardly rocket components. Goods sit idle for months or are never delivered at all. In such circumstances, no-one could have any confidence that the goods would ever reach Gaza.
Clear Violations of International Law

As yet, it is still unknown exactly what happened on board the flotilla vessels boarded by Israeli forces. Even at this early stage, however, some international law matters are fairly clear.

First, absent any intention by the flotilla to attack Israel, or any suspicion of piracy, it was unlawful for Israel to forcibly board foreign merchant vessels in international waters.

Secondly, such action amounted to an unlawful interference in the enforcement jurisdiction of the ""flag-States"" (countries of registration) of those vessels, such as Turkey.

Thirdly, it violated the fundamental principle of freedom of navigation on the high seas, codified in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea of 1982.

Fourthly, under international human rights law, the apprehension and detention of those on board the vessels likely amounts to arbitrary, unlawful detention, contrary to article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, since there is lawful basis for detention.

Fifthly, if Israeli forces killed people, they may not only have infringed the human right to life, but they may also have committed serious international crimes. Under article 3 of the Rome Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation of 1988, it is an international crime for any person to seize or exercise control over a ship by force, and also a crime to injure or kill any person in the process.

Ironically, that treaty was adopted after Palestinian terrorists hijacked the Italian cruise ship, the Achille Lauro, in 1985, in which a Jewish American was killed.

In such cases, any claim of self-defense by Israeli forces is irrelevant. The treaty necessarily adopts a strict approach. One cannot attack a ship and then claim self-defense if the people on board resist the unlawful use of violence.

Legally speaking, government military forces rappelling onto a ship to illegally capture it are treated no differently than other criminals. The right of self-defense in such situations rests with the passengers on board: a person is legally entitled to resist one's own unlawful capture, abduction and detention.

Whether doing so is wise, in the face of heavily armed commandos, is a different question. Whether running the gauntlet of an Israeli military blockade is sensible or foolhardy is another.
Israel Has Become Its Own Worst Enemy

This latest sad and shocking episode is a reminder of Israel's recklessness towards the lives of others, its utter disregard for international opinion, and its incivility as an outlaw of the international community.

Israel has become its own worst enemy. It prioritizes its own interests with a callous lack of empathy for others. It is simply unable to imagine the suffering it inflicts upon others, and treats harm to Israelis as the only game in town. Its absolutism of mind and politics has crushing consequences for Palestinians.

Far from ensuring its own security, Israel is unraveling it: no-one should be surprised if Israel has just succeeded in recruiting the next generation of martyrs keen to attack it.

Absolutism, violence, and the evaporation of peace in the region will continue as long as the international community continues to handle Israel with kid gloves.

By the way, -isme tends to be more masculine (le capitalisme, le protectionnisme, le féminisme, ...).

Interview is feminine. It is an anglicism, but has been adopted in European French for a century, so it is in the dictionnary. Fun fact from a Québécois : ""Interview"" is borrowed from English, but in English, this word is itself borrowed from the French word ""entrevue"". In Quebec, we prefer ""entrevue"", except that we use ""intervieweur"", ""interviewé' and ""interviewer"", because those words were missing in French.

,0,"I'm a DNA buff, and what we're learning is that Arthur Koestler's ""Khazar"" theory (in the ""Thirteenth Tribe"") is probably largely accurate. Dr. Shlomo Sand isn't the only one—and isn't the first, by any means— to back the multi-regional origin theory of the Jews.

Genetics, too, has weighed in—and the results are persuasive.

First, let's get this point straight: The original DNA analysis was largely hampered by two factors early on: 1) the relatively primitive state of paleogenetics a mere 15 years ago, and 2) Politicization by . . . well . . . activist groups and nation-states bent on advancing certain pre-minted ideologies.
For instance, early genetic papers on the notion of a cohesive ""Jewish people"" (funded largely by Israel) have been, for the most part, debunked by recent advances in the field. At the time-period, Israeli-funded geneticists like Hammer advanced the notion that Ashkenazic Jews and Sephardic Jews had the same origin because significant portions of both groups had Haplogroup J. Since then, Haplogroup J has been refined into two different subclades: Haplogroup J1 [which is associated with Arab populations] and Haplogroup J2 [which is associated more with Euro-Meds, like Greeks, Sicilians, Balkan types, etc.]

Turns out that Ashkenazic Jews are—to deal in statistical generalities—more aligned with Arab haplogroup J1, and that Sephardic Jews are more aligned with Euro-Med J2. They are not—I repeat: NOT—indicative of a common origin, as the initial press releases from Israeli genetic labs boasted.
Even the early press releases about the so-called ""Cohen gene"" have been abandoned by mainstream geneticists.

When you step back, you realize that a lot of the initial assertions served a nationalist agenda and that shaped the early (sometimes flamboyant) claims.

Let me make this point clear, too: I don't have a dog in his fight. I'm not Jewish, nor an anti-Jewish raver.
I'm just someone who knows a little bit about the subject.

Ashkenazi Jews have two basic haplogroups that you would expect Khazars to have: Aside from haplogroup J1, they have large percentages of R1a and G. G is associated with the Caucasus region (where modern-day Georgia and Ossetia are). This is precisely the location of the ancient Khazar kingdom. Haplogroup R1a is associated with the Indo-European groups that originated north of the Black Sea region (once again, a geographical location consonant with the Khazar kingdom). Even the name ""Ashkenaz"" comes from an Indo-European tribe from the steppes of Central Asia, the Scyths. The name for Scyth in Assyrian was ""Aškuzai"" or ""Iškuzai"" (""Scythian""). The Hittites called them ""Ashkuzai"". This was the etymological basis for the biblical Hebrew ""Ashkenaz"".

You can go any online resource for the Scythian empire—say, Wikipedia, for instance—and you'll notice that the Scyth empire can be overlaid atop much of the same region as the later ""Khazar"" empire.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythians

(Both Scyths and Khazars were related tribes under the Indo-European umbrella in Central Asia.) And, yes, I know: various historians and writers alternate between calling them ""Indo-Europeans"" and ""Turkic"". You'll see conflicting references to both. The truth is: It was largely the same ethnic stock, but linguistically they changed over time. So whereas the Greeks and Romans would have regarded them as more or less ""Indo-Europeans,"" later Byzantine historians would call them ""Turkic"".
Regardless: Both groups, in genetic tests, are associated with haplogroup R1a. (Paleogeneticists know this from digs and exhumations of skeletons.)

By contrast, the aboriginal haplogroup in the region is G.

So what it looks like is ""Indo-European"" tribes stormed into Caucasian villages [where the aborigines were haplogroup G] and spread their genes around. So people in the Khazar region have both haplogroups R1a and G in high ratios. And that's EXACTLY what we see in Ashkenazic populations.

They have precisely the genetic makeup you'd expect for descendants of Khazars, with additional genetic influence from the Middle East. And where there IS Middle Eastern DNA, it's from Arabs NOT from Jews. (In other words, it looks like Arab converts to Judaism traveled the 150 miles to modern-day Georgia (probably as merchants) and married local Slavic girls.

But even these ethnically Arab merchants weren't numerically significant enough to give every Ashkenazic male a haplogroup J1 marker. Massive percentages of males have the aforementioned R1a and G . . . meaning that a ton of the founding males in these communities were NEVER from the Middle East.
Sephardic Jews—who have always been thought of as ""purer""—since they have haplogroup J2 (which *is* consonant with Palestine) are probably not even from there either. Turns out Haplogroup J2 probably originated in the Balkans, not in the Middle East at all. And that it traveled around the entire Mediterranean basin in the mesolithic period. Meaning: Greeks have it, Etruscans had it, Phoenicians had it, North African Berbers had it, etc.

And according to Shlomo Sand, there's overwhelming evidence that Spain's Jews came from North African Berbers who converted to Judaism in the 6th Century. (That accords with the archaeology, the written records, the history, and. yes, even the DNA).

In conclusion, having haplogroup J did NOT mean that someone was, ipso facto, a ""Jew"" or related to ""ancient Judeans"" or any other such rot, as the initial press releases from Israeli geneticists claimed.
They were overzealous in those early p.r. campaigns, and very few of their original conclusions have withstood the test of time.

&gt;it's tiny and has very arguable cases to make for its sovereignty in even the areas that the Arabs claim.

Before 1948, there was no arguable case to expel hundreds of thousands from their homes to create a Jewish state. While many European Jews understandably couldn't return to their homes, that doesn't make it ok to take away the homes of an entirely unrelated people. It was an underhanded trick on the part of Britain when the US easily could have taken in the Jewish refugees.

But I don't think that the European war was won by the USA at all -- supplies didn't arrive from the USA in serious numbers until late 1943/early 1944, by which point the Russians had completely turned the tide of the war. And while the German air force was destroyed in the west, neither their manufacturing capacity nor their manpower were destroyed there. 

The Russians killed the soldiers and destroyed the tanks, and effectiveness of the bomber war in destroying manufacturing capacity, especially before late 1944, was vastly overstated. The Allies made a lot of claims about how much they hit and destroyed, but those were wartime propaganda claims. As far as I've seen, the Germans were affected by the bombings than the Allies wanted to think.

That's not to say that the bomber war had no effect, or that Normandy was completely pointless, and I'm not trying to make those claims. The war was a huge and complex undertaking on all sides. But the more I've learned about it, the more I'm seeing that claims like ""most important"" have more to do with the point of view of the claimant's country.

,1,"Under the monotheistic religions of the Levant (namely, Christianity and Islam), sorcery came to be associated with heresy and apostasy  and to be viewed as evil. Among the Catholics, Protestants, and secular leadership of the European Late Medieval/Early Modern period, fears regarding witchcraft rose to fever pitch, and sometimes led to large-scale witch-hunts. Throughout this time, it was increasingly believed that Christianity was engaged in an apocalyptic battle against the Devil and his secret army of witches, who had entered into a diabolical pact. In total, tens or hundreds of thousands of people were executed, and others were imprisoned, tortured, banished, and had lands and possessions confiscated. The majority of those accused were women, though in some regions the majority were men.  Accusations of witchcraft were frequently combined with other charges of heresy against such groups as the Cathars and Waldensians.

The Malleus Maleficarum, a famous witch-hunting manual used by both Catholics and Protestants, outlines how to identify a witch, what makes a woman more likely than a man to be a witch, how to put a witch on trial, and how to punish a witch. The book defines a witch as evil and typically female.

In the modern Western world, witchcraft accusations have often accompanied the satanic ritual abuse moral panic. Such accusations are a counterpart to blood libel of various kinds, which may be found throughout history across the globe.

First world nations keep electing Rothschild agents using a two party ""Punch and Judy"" puppet show political system they designed and called democracy, without anybody understanding what's going on behind the back curtain. People elect representatives who have a greater alliance to a party than to the people who elected them while the top party politicians loyalty is to the Rothschild agenda.

You don't choose your presidents or prime ministers, two people are selected behind closed doors and then you choose between these 2 people not even chosen by you who are portrayed as being different when the same agenda continues no matter who you vote for, Their loyalty is to the agenda, this is what gives them a seat in the election process, anyone else who stands will be taken out by the Zionist media.

The current system is designed to distract us, wasting our time fighting over things of little importance that without the puppet show can be solved easily, they designed the system this way to have you think you have a say, while behind the curtain they continue on with their agenda.

People need to start voting independents only if they want to claim back the government.

The current system is a puppet show, a fools democracy and they are creating their new world order out of the chaos while we are distracted fighting over nothing.

The current political system in America is designed to allow the continuation of America as the Foreign Military Corporation for the House of Rothschild while the CIA stands for Corporate Interests Abroad with all terrorists groups allowed to function only as tools and assets of the CIA. They get their way through Order out of Chaos.

They create their money out of thin air, and it is backed by nothing. They let you print it and you pay them interest for the right. These International bankers own the Central Banks in every nation in the world, except the so-called seven rogue nations. The U.S. State Department. defines ""rogue nations"" as any nation that harbours of supports terrorists. The present nations that meet this definition are/were: Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Cuba, North Korea, and Sudan. There is no evidence that Cuba or North Korea harbour or support terrorist, the only common thread between these countries is that none of them allow the International bankers to control their central banks.

Israel ignores the world and does what it likes, Israel is widely believed to be the sixth country in the world to develop nuclear weapons and to be one of four nuclear-armed countries not recognised as a Nuclear Weapons State by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the others being India, Pakistan and North Korea.

International Atomic Energy Agency regards Israel as a state possessing nuclear weapons.

Israel maintains a policy known as ""nuclear ambiguity"". Israel has never officially admitted to having nuclear weapons, Although Israel first built a nuclear weapon in 1967-68, it was not publicly confirmed from the inside until Mordechai Vanunu, a former Israeli nuclear technician, revealed details of the program to the British press in 1986. Israel is currently believed to possess between 75 and 400 nuclear warheads with the ability to deliver them by ground, aircraft, and submarine.

Israel has ignored over 200 UN security resolutions against it and secretly nuclear armed itself, this is the country America and England should be shaking their heads at but instead they use their Veto power to protect it knowing its role in the global agenda, knowing its owned by the House of Rothschild. Israel gets to do what ever it wants while at the same time promotes propaganda against Palestine, Iran and others.

Frank Wisner, Allan Dulles, Richard Helms and Philip Graham head the effort. Graham is publisher of The Washington Post, which becomes a major CIA player. Eventually, the CIA's media assets will include ABC, NBC, CBS, Time, Newsweek, Associated Press, United Press International, Reuters, Hearst Newspapers, Scripps-Howard, Copley News Service and more. By the CIA's own admission, at least 25 organizations and 400 journalists will become CIA assets.

The CIA ran it for 30 years in house and it was supposedly shut down by G H Bush after being exposed in the church committee hearings, but all they did was change the media ownership laws and bury it deeper through privatisation. Now 90% of the worlds major media is in the control of 6 companies, and the dissemination continues.

If some country was at war with Somalia and had a naval blockade, that country would not let anything through without at minimum inspecting it. 

Comparing this whole thing to piracy is a bit disingenuous, don't you think? At minimum isn't it possible Israel has legitimate interests in knowing what's going in and out of a territory controlled by a group sworn to its destruction?

Z,1,"Yeah, that's more of what I was getting at.  I guess what I meant, and really did a poor job of saying, is that quality and quantity of time spent most often go hand-in-hand.  I'm not bitter about losing and don't want you to think I'm saying I should've won.  I was really mainly talking about the Protoss video when I talked about quantity of time spent.  I just can't help myself.  Lets break it down:

1) Terran Vid: Interesting concept, lots of throwbacks to in-game lines, good music, but there was no real story or connection to the characters and the line delivery was entirely uninspired.  Maybe a few retakes here and there.  The credits take up the last 1/4th of the video.  Could've been done in 2-3 days.  I like that they did live-action though.  Them being probably the only ones that did this, I think it's cool they were included, although I think they should've been runner up, not grand prize.

2) 3-D Film: It wasn't my cup of tea, and the graphics weren't exactly Pixar quality, but it's obvious this guy put TONS of time into his video.  This is one of those situations where the video might not've blown me away, but I'm glad they gave him runner up status because he couldn't have made that and not spent many 10s of hours on it.

3) Protoss Video: This is the one I think should've won because it is very high quality, but also could not have been done without hours and hours of painstaking work.  If this is the guy I think it is, he posted in the forum that he'd spent over 100 hours on his?  The cinematography is awesome, the unit battles are intense.  The whole thing has a level of polish that the others, including mine, lack.  On top of that, he advertises the game's beautiful graphics (something I indirectly hoped to do in our video).  I really do not know how this didn't win.

4) Zerg Paper Slide Show:  Firstly, I wouldn't call this stop-motion.  I feel it's insulting to people who actually do stop motion like Tomasz in the EU winners.  Also, I've never studied videography (just kind of taught myself), but I have done photography for years.  This video was approximately 2 minutes long with about 1 frame per second.  So, in essence, all he needed to do was cut out some paper printouts of units, take a grand total of 120 photos on a tripod-mounted camera panning left-to-right (which could be done in 20 minutes easily), literally drag and drop them into video editing software (it will auto-create video from the images in sequence), adjust the length of them all to 1-second, then drop something like 20 audio clips onto an audio track and you're done.  It was paper cutouts on a wrinkled blanket with a friggin' turtle and rubber ducky and some of the photos are even out of focus.  It could've been done in 2-3 hours and the fact that this guy won an HDTV and gaming mouse for that video kind of blows my mind.  I feel it kind of taints the rest of the winners' entries, and it's unfortunate that a video that took so little effort won so big when other entries like ""Like a 'toss"" were a lot more fun and memorable.  This one's just forgettable.  It has no story, no real original content...  I don't get Blizzard's reasoning on this one.

If one can add 0.25 of a suns worth of power an area  ~250 Watt / m^2 , and extra 250 watt is not  pleasantly warm if you are in a dessert. 


So you have more than one of these things in the sky,  out at a respectable GEO distance.  How many do you need spotting the same 10 km place before the effects become sufficient to be used as a weapon? 

Psychological weapon : The answer is one.    Wave that feels-sort-of-like-the-sun  beam around at night and send propaganda telling the opposition that they are getting their nuts cooked off and are loosing a year of their life every night they spend out side and feel the warmth. 


Crimes against nature : a) Melting : The answer is one.  Find a nice glacier or snow field upstream of your target.   Put a 24x7 heat lamp on a 10 km wide swath of it.   .. 23 mW * day / cm^2 ==  6 grams (ml) of meltwater per cm^2.  or about 60 liters / m^2 , or about 60M liters / km ^2 ,  and the 10 km round beam has about 315 of those a day.   With some artistry emense damage could be done  many glaciers have already started flowing faster due to increased lubrication from melt-water.   Or just build yourself a lake with a convenient ice dam, then remove the dam.

B)  Fire : In the summer some places get really dry.  With an extra 1/4th sun around that dryness could get much much worse.   Entire forests could be set abase with zero recourse from anyone who can't get to GEO.   If just the tinderbox isn't enough for you add a (relatively small) IR laser to the solar power station. 


C) direct Melting action :  Depending on how fast you need the effects to take effect, lets just say 50 stations.   50 stations or the equivalent of 10 suns.   A normal microwave oven operates at around 1 watt / cm^2  ,  50 stations would give about that..... over a 10 Km radius spot.   How long do living things last in a microwave?    Not very long, say for sake of argument 10 minutes.   It would take 112 days to remove all live from Spain, the third largest country in the EU.

Egypt has a right to close it's border. Israel has a right to close it's border.

Israel has NO right to Close Gaza's sea border or air access.

Gettit?

Once more for luck?

Any country has a right to close its border. Its not always moral, and I dont agree with Egypts stance but I understand it. There leaders have made a choice to align themselves with the USA for cash and have that right.   
What Countries cannot do is close off another countries borders. That's called a blockade. That is what Israel is doing.
That is why Israel is responsible for Gaza.

Another angle. Three houses in a row. The center one is Gaza.

The one on the left. ""The center one cannot pass across my yard to get out.""
The one on the right. ""The center one cannot pass across my yard, Nor can it use its front or rear doors to get out"".

The one on the right is the one blockading the center one.

Has that sunk in?

A few details for those that want to look into this deeper.

the border agreement between Israel and Egypt regarding the Gaza and Egypt border is very tight and monitored by the US and tied to $1.3B of aid the US give Egypt.  
There isn't much point in Israel blocking all access in and out of GAZA then leaving the Egypt /Gaza border wide open is there? IT was tied up before Israel left GAZA. 
 

[**A New Reality on the Egypt-Gaza Border**](
http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=2374)


On September 1, 2005, following lengthy negotiations, Egypt and Israel signed the Agreed Arrangements Regarding the Deployment of a Designated Force of Border Guards along the Border in the Rafah Area (the Agreed Arrangements). This agreement was designed to enable Israel to evacuate the Philadelphia corridor, an eight-mile (thirteen-kilometer) military zone along the Gaza-Egypt border, through the deployment of Egyptian border patrol forces to the Egyptian side of the border in order to prevent smuggling into Gaza. In eighty-three clauses, the agreement describes the mission, weaponry, infrastructure, and obligations of the parties


Whats more [as this congressional report mentions ](http://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL34346.pdf) Israel has not only exaggerated the threat posed by weapons smuggling, but is deliberately acting to “sabotage” U.S.-Egyptian relations by demanding that the United States condition its annual $1.3 billion in military assistance on Egypt’s efforts to thwart smuggling
A bit more info: [The Rafah Terminal Crossing](http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL34346.pdf)
The Rafah crossing point is the only non-Israeli army-controlled access point
for Palestinians to leave Gaza. When Israel unilaterally withdrew from the Gaza Strip
in 2005, Secretary of State Rice helped broker an agreement (“The Agreement on
Movement and Access”) between Israel, Egypt, and the Palestinian Authority to
provide Gazans access through the Rafah terminal. Israel agreed to allow the
European Union to maintain a Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM) to monitor the
Rafah crossing. Without a physical presence on the border, Israel monitored the
checkpoint using closed-circuit cameras. **Most importantly, Israel retained the power
to open and close the crossing based on its assessment of the security situation.**
After Hamas took over the Gaza Strip in June 2007, Egypt worked with Israel
to close the Rafah crossing. According to the last EUBAM factsheet, “Since Corporal
Gilad Shalit was captured [by Hamas] on 25 June 2006, the Rafah Crossing Point
(RCP) has been closed for normal operations and open on an exceptional basis only.

&gt;you are not her parent, so stop acting like you are.

I know, I'm sorry. I'm rather protective of her which is why I act like it I guess. I've always wanted a daughter, but anyway. I'm really trying hard not to come across as her parent, it's why I never once told her to do anything. It's why I'm just asking her to consider my suggestion as opposed to throw it out the window. And I know I'm not her parent. Her dad stopped her from coming twice now and if I was she would have come.

&gt;Her actual parent is sick, and she wants to be with him. 

I've kind of mentioned this in another reply (after you posted), so see the long one for a better explanation. But I know and I think that it is a very good decision. But I feel as though she should spend the time with him. Have some good memories with him, build a stronger connection with him. As she has moved to a neighbouring state for Uni she already isn't seeing/being with him when she's at Uni, it's why my advice is to take the next semester off and make sure that in 50 years she doesn't regret talking to me all through her holidays as opposed to spending time with him.

I just worry that if she doesn't go to Europe at the start of next year she'll never go. And that has been her dream for so long. She's studied French for years because she wants to. I know that you're probably going to say that it's her life, but the fact is that I love her and I want her to achieve her dreams.

&gt; Especially since you are young and should probably get more experience in a real, face to face relationship before asking someone to move across the world for you.

I know this, I just guess it feels so right, and you know what people say ""you know when it is [right]"". I think it's partly seeing my sister fall for an American guy online and move across the world for him (they've now been married for 6ish years and started dating when she was about my age). But please don't think that I'm just trying to go after what my sister has got, I'm not, I am genuinely in love with this girl and I really don't want it to come down to breaking up.

Yeah I know, but it's just something I want to experience as well.

&gt;Based on your ages alone, I would strongly discourage anyone from moving such a distance, even if you had a model relationship that would make even Victoria and Albert jealous.

Again I know it is possible, and I know how it feels to be with her. I know that it's unlikely but that doesn't mean I should throw it away. In the opening post I said (paraphrasing now) that statistics are against us, and even if we break up after we moved I know we'd still be friends. Still be able to support each other, and we'd still at least get what we want out of life. She'd achieve her dreams of moving to Europe (with someone she knows, instead of being alone; with residence set up, instead of that being on her plate; with a job (uni), instead of trying to find a job in France, without being fluent).

,11,"First, background on some of the names:

&gt; **The Anthropomorphists** (sometimes 'Literalists') (al-mushabbihah or al-mujassimah **[and al-hashawiyah]**) comprise a sect among Muslims who ascribe physical human characteristics to God. This group arose in the formative period of Islamic theology, around the second century. Insisting that all references to God in the Qur'an are literal, the Anthropomorphists reject the rhetorical use of metaphor therein. They view certain verses as proof that God is located in space and has limbs. A strict traditional Sunni perspective views anyone who takes such verses literally as an Anthropomorphist. Another more generous view deems as Anthropomorphists only those who do not stipulate that God is ""without modality"" (bi la kayf). While al-Tahawi is clearly opposed to this group, and certain sections in his creed address the group's specific heresies, many Anthropomorphists have appropriated his creed as their own and interpreted his clear statements in novel ways to avoid the conclusions one must draw from a more standard reading of the text.
&gt;
&gt; **The Rationalists (al-muztazilah)** are a sect that formed when Wasil b. Ata left the study circle of his teacher, al-Hasan al-Basri, and formed his own group. Rationalists are primarily a theological school (though they also had juristic points as well as a political philosophy). Though not a well-organized group of scholars, the Rationalists did introduce systematic theology to the Muslim community, which forced the Sunni scholars to produce refutations that invariably clarified their own positions within a Sunni framework of theology. The Rationalists presented the greates doctrinal challenge to the early Muslim community; ironically, Rationlist thought migrated to Europe in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and heavily influenced Catholic thought. Muslims abdandoned Rationalism for a middle position between revealed truths that present themselves as supra-rational in many instances and natural theology that demands reasonsed thought as a basis for belief and its defense. 
&gt;
&gt; Some of the Rationalists' beliefs which differ from the Sunnis' are as follows: the Rationalists interpret the attributes of God figuratively; they say the Qur'an is created; they deny the Beatific Vision; they reject God's volition concerning acts of ""evil""; they believe God must punish the sinners and reward the righteous; they declare that a Muslim who has committed a grave sin and who has not yet repented is neither a believer nor a disbeliever but is in between - a reprobate or a malefactor (while the Sunnis say that such a person is a believer but in the Providence of God [mashi at Allah]: if God chooses, He pardons him, and if not, He punishes him); and they asser that it is the duty of every Muslim to ensure the good and prevent the unacceptable (without the conditions that Sunis stipulate). A revival of Rationalist thought occurred in the late nineteenth century that still impacts modern Muslim discourse. It was started largely in Egypt by a group of Azhari scholars confronting the Enlightenment and Europe's encroaching power and influence on Muslim lands.
&gt;
&gt; **The Pantheists (al-jahmiyaah)** are followers of Jahm b. Safwan (d. 128/745); known for their negation of divine attributes, Pantheists believe that ""God is everything."" THey also claim that Hell is not eternal and that human beings are forced to act, a doctrine they share with the Determinists.
&gt;
&gt; **The Determinists (al-jabriyyah)** claim that human beings have no choice in their actions and thus cannot be held responsible for them. According to Sadi al-Ghiryani, for the Determinists, ""the state of the human being is like that of a feather in the wind; they believe that a man is on parity with an inanimate creation, and that he has neither volition nor choice...""
&gt;
&gt; **The Dualists (al-qadariyyah)** are followers of Ma'bad al-Juhani (d. 80/699). Known for their rejection of divine preordainmnent of good and evil, Dualists believe that God has no volition concerning human action, once free willl has been granted; that is, they believe that God creates human beings and then humans create their own actions. Dualists also believe that while good is from God, evil is not. The Prophet (sallallahu alayhi wasallam) predicted their advent and called them the ""Zoroastrians of Islam"" due to their rejection that evil was also from God.

It just provokes a whole new kind of discussion which you cannot win. No government should be able to play around personal freedom by feeding you with fear, that's what's difficult in fight against terrorism (you cant just shoot around everyone thinking they're terrorists) (and that's what's wrong with Patriot Act, for another example). Noone is guilty until he is proven to be.

&gt; And the raid was designed to play in Hams hands.

That's your take of the issue. But the important thing is, if there are no weapons on board (sticks and kitchens knives surely aren't), and if the aim is to provide humanitarian relief to the area, you cannot land armed commandos to their transport, take control of their ship by lethal force and you can definitely not kill them and do that in the international waters.

My view on the blockade is very clear that it is illegal and super-ineffective, but even if that was not the case, there were other ways to stop a ship without killing people on board. That is literally the last resort, there is no going beyond that. I know it's not the same but, EU and USA deal with tons of ships full of illegal immigrants every year, but you don't see any killings there. Israeli government could stop the ships, force them to change their routes without any armed conflict, by for instance actually blocking their way. But in this case it is very possible that they need to make a show-off to Turkey and the rest of the world. I am in fact sure of it as it is evidenced by the events leading up to this attack, such as the foreign minister's atrocious behavior against the Turkish ambassador.

But the main problem that the ""Dust to Dust"" study has with the Prius' impact on the environment comes next.

That smelted nickel then has to travel (via container ship) to Europe to be refined, then to China to be made into ""nickel foam,"" then to Japan for assembly, and finally to the United States.

The Jewish people, backed up by genetic research are clearly as indigenous to the Middle East as the Arabs are.

Due to various reasons, the Jews were unable to return to the land in greater numbers until modern Zionism began in the late 19th century. Living as a minority in any country, no matter how progressive and modern it is, has proven to be dangerous for Jews. In addition, Jews, like all people, deserve to have a land to which they can call a home. This narrative however, does not ignore the fact that there are Arab who also call this land home.

&gt; The problem is the imams. And the reason for this is quite obvious, even though nobody tends to give it a lot of thought.

&gt; Violence is bound to occur when politics and religion mix. It doesn't matter what [ideological and religious] variety. But especially if politics uses religion to get to the people and create a stir. One only needs to look at Northern Ireland to see that this problem is not limited to Islam. The fact that Christian youths tend into the other direction here is for the same reason: Christianity in this country at this point in time is not relevantly politicized. As a result they are ~90% composed of nags wearing vegan sandals, who (thanks to their naivety) toe every line.

&gt; And exactly that is the problem, the same thing as with the Muslims. It's just that their line is somewhat different.

&gt; The Imams who were taught abroad bring **their** Islam with them. And this is the Islam they teach. It is infected with politics and brings the conflicts from the Middle East directly to our doorsteps.

&gt; Lots of them don't even speak the local language, and most of them neither have nor want any grasp of the life situation of the Muslims here.

&gt; You don't need to be a rocket scientist to suspect what was imported here. These people are not the pacifists and dissidents the countries abroad wanted to get rid of, they are reliable agitators.

&gt; At this time this problem exists primarily in Islam. But nobody should be fooled to alternate cause and effect. The cause is not them coming from abroad and being Muslims. The cause is that they are political rabble-rousers. It can happen with different preachers for different reasons too. Mixa (an ultra-conservative German Catholic bishop who regularly slobbered about how immoral atheists, heathens and homosexuals were and who had to resign over the recent child abuse scandal and ), even though on a different level, already made a spectacle of himself several times.

&gt; State and society ensure freedom of religion, and that freedom is quite farreaching. But that brings with it the obligation to be watchful over what certain groups do with that freedom.

&gt; Criticizing the secret service for monitoring Mosques without reason is reasonable. But the reason for this is because the secret service looks at the wrong places. It's not always the Imam and most often it's not the Mosque. Those who home in on that limit their field of vision to the irrelevant.

&gt; The carefully worded ""macho mentality"" is rooted there too, for among the Muslim one can discern the opposite: Being less religious usually results in less aggressive behavior here too. The repressive perception of women is not necessarily rooted in Islam but in the perception of women the imported Imams are spreading. This perception of women is not limited to men but extends to women too. Those who argue that Islamists abuse their women ignores the fact that this opressive system is supported by a number of women too; honor killings (of Muslim girls by their family) are not just mans' thing, Mama often is involved too.

&gt; An example for this are the Islamist ""women's shelters"" in Pakistan, whose adherents are not less militant than their male fellow fundamentalists.

&gt; The solution to the core problem is as banal as it is obvious. Society has to make sure that there's no need for imports, and Muslims have to stop living their wagon fort mentality that defines them as victims in the first place. A European Islam (and that includes Turkey) cannot be an Islam of Saudi character. It is incompatible with everything a liberal society stands for. Those who do not accept this are doomed to a shadowy life at the margins of society.

&gt; The necessary efforts probably are much less hard than assumed by both sides. The few Imams who were trained here [in Germany] are very popular among their fellow Muslims, because they know of the problems the local Muslims face, can address those problems, and are often able and qualified to do other things beside preaching.",atheism,0,0,True,0,1426334452,False,[deleted],,c0rlvhl,True,0,t5_2qh2p,1275943236,,t1_c0rlvhl,t3_ccalx,t3_ccalx

finally, the 1948 war which resulted in hundreds of thousands of palestinians leaving their homes was started by the ARABS and not by the Jews. If you clearly read the declaration of independence of the state of Israel in May 1948, you will see that Israeli PM David Ben-Gurion understood there was going to be a sizable Arab population in the country and they were willing to grant them full rights. However, war was initiated by the Arab states in which they wanted to drive the Jews into the sea. As a result of war, like any other war, there were refugees. While it is unfortunate they were forced from their homes, the true crime has been the squalid condition these Arab refugees still live in today in Syria, Lebanon and other arab states.

I'll give you one of them; my family for example is from Austria then when things started going to shit for the Jews in that area, people blaming them for the economic trouble at the end of WWI etc. etc.,  my Great-grandmother left for the U.S. while some of the family stayed behind; thats when it got really bad-- Hitler and all that. Another part of my family then left for, then British controlled, Palestine as a safe haven until the end of the war so that they could wait it out then go back to their homes--this didn't exactly pan out as the part of the family, along with most of the Jews, in the homeland kinda got rounded up and killed; having this happen kinda makes you change your mind. 

So fast forward a couple of years(end of WWII), the Allies(US Britain France) come along and find a couple of hundred thousand Jews in some camps who really didn't have a good time there. So they say ""we should probable do something about this,"" the Jews say ""is it cool if we stay with you guys"" the Allies are like ""ugh kinda full atm"" why don't you stay in Britain beach house(Palestine) the Jews are like thats a great idea we use to have a house there back in the day. At the same time some Jews who had parts of their family already in the US and other parts of Europe are able to immigrate with partial success. The Jews who either choose or were forced to go to Palestine get there to find it not as idealistic as the really old book describes it, so what do they do: they get really fucking defensive some want to leave immediately the others(the guys who really wanted to go there) want there to be as many Jews in the area as possible so the try and make them stay along with impose incentives for more Jews to come. 

America and the allies see a great opportunity at this point for an another ally in the region(Britain's empire is shrinking, Americas is growing) they decide, with the encouragement of many American Jews to help arm the country-- they do. Israel's neighbors don't like the preferential treatment and attack the new country, but because of the preferential treatment they lost the war. The result of this a section of the indigenous Arab population still left in the parts of the territories that were conquered (Palestinians), these people are pissed as are any group of people that lose a war. This sets up a series of events that leads us to present day. Major parts of this included meddling in the region during the Cold War by both the US and Russia(see the Taliban) and the resurgence of fundamental Islam. The part of Europe that was just a generation ago the homeland of the majority of the Jews in Israel has become the Eastern Block behind the Iron curtain, and large groups of Russian Jews are now migrating to Israel and the US to escape. By the end of the Cold War there are at least 3 generations in Israel, and it pretty safe to say that once you have grandchildren in a country you call it home, also as result of the population growth you get the settlements as a cheap solution to the population growth-- and as with most things the cheap solution is usually the worst in the long run.

,3,"Another theory that explains this story in non-literal terms was put forward by Daniel Quinn in the book ""The Story of B"".

Warning, this is going to require quit a bit of explanation, bear with me.

His idea was that instead of being a story about individuals, it was a story about tribes.

So, about 12,000 years ago in the fertile crescent a major shift in lifestyles was taking place. This was the [Neolithic Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution), commonly referred to as the agricultural revolution.

Before this time, most tribes in this area were nomadic sheep herders.

Having an agrarian society has huge advantages over hunter-gather or nomadic shepherding societies. 

First of all, growing crops in the manner in which was being developed (i.e. clearing a section of land completely and using that land solely for growing human food) *always* leaves a surplus of food. Which can be stored into barns and used as an insurance against starvation in lean winters. 

Secondly it creates wealth. If you can manage to grow enough food, you can, instead of growing the food yourself, hire people to grow the next years crop for you. (paying them with food) You can also hire soldiers to protect your crops and your property.

One of the other byproducts of this lifestyle is overpopulation. Whenever you have a surplus of food and x animals in a population, x will always increase. (Interestingly, human population has been growing steadily every since this period in history. And the rate in which the population doubles, halves each time it does.)

So the situation looks like this. You have a bunch of wealthy, powerful people in one area, and a bunch of poor, relatively powerless people living in all adjacent areas.

So what do you do if you are this group of powerful people, with an army (possibly the worlds first professional army), and you suddenly have too many people for your little bit of land to support?

The problem is you need more land right? So what you do is you go and take over the land occupied by one of your neighbors! What if they don't like you waltzing in there and taking the land that you were using?

What did the Europeans do to the Native Americans? They killed them of course.

Here's how it relates to Adam and Eve, or more specifically, Adam and Eve + Cain and Abel. The people in this story can be seen as I have said as tribes. You have the tribe of Cain and the tribe of Abel.

Now to the tribe of Abel (the shepherds), it must have seemed as if the tribe of Cain had some superior, almost godlike knowledge that they did not posses, how else would they have gotten so powerful all of a sudden? Furthermore, now these people, whom they had formerly had good relations with (like brothers) were murdering them. So this knowledge not only made you powerful, it made you evil as well.

So, in the biblical story Abel who was a good man and a Shepard gave tribute to the God, and he was pleased. Cain who was a farmer gave tribute to God and God was not pleased.

Cain in a fit of anger, kills his brother. And God punishes him (and man) to work in the fields ever after.

Seen in this light, the story can be seen as the story of a war.

Ironically it seems as if the villains of the story, adopted it and adapted it to their own use. Now man *must* work as farmers because it is a mandate straight from the big man himself.
