black,1,"Corporatism, that you refer to there, is not about publicly-traded limited-liability joint-stock companies. ""Corporate"" could mean many things in English. It refers to many people acting as a single entity, so we can talk about the Church being the first corporate entity in Europe. *Corporazioni* are, my Italian dictionary tells me, guilds and the like. So it instead refers to trade organisations, unions and the like merging with the government -- superficially resembling syndicalism, although corporatism was created as an answer to socialism, providing class collaboration instead of class warfare. 

The corporatism bit is a total red herring anyway. The Fascists did incorporate these entities into government, but only so that they could be controlled, and the voice of labour silenced. They never really ""did"" corporatism, though many of the members were supportive. They were, after all, relatively poor veterans of the Great War. So they might think that making these organisations part of the state would help the working man. As you stated, there was plenty of rhetoric about helping them out. The chaps in charge had other ideas though.

There have been states that have adopted corporatist polices and kind of meant it, for instance the Republic of Ireland: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Partnership

The animus of the Fascists, as is made plain in their statements and acts, is that of national rebirth -- palingenesis. This was to be achieved through a totalitarian state, ""tutto nello stato, niente al di fuori dello stato, nulla contro lo stato,"" and all that.

Oh one more thing I forgot to add. In Arabic culture families are generally very tight and close. So some things I've noticed in similar situations to yours, are that they will sometimes...err....invite themselves over...or take liberties with your time, for example. In the Middle East family and friends can randomly show up to say hi and then just stay well past dinner and it's all accepted. Whereas in Western countries people tend to be more formal about this and expect invitations and such things.

Also Arabs tend to have a much smaller personal zone than Westerners. I once took a sociology class on this. Whilst Germans or Swiss might need 1 meter of space when talking to someone to feel comfortable, Arabs, Asians, southern Europeans, and South Americans all have a very small personal zone. So don't be surprised if you find your family to be ""close talkers"". Physical contact is also much more common. My father (Arab) hugs and kisses total strangers. My mother and her family (Scandinavian) like a good long distance between people, and I don't think they've ever kissed anyone but their spouses!

redblack,1,"&gt;Eh? Where? Why do you think this?

Fascism arose out of the white working classes of Europe. It was promoted by the ruling class elites in extreme situations (i.e. Germany on the brink of Civil War after WWI) because it naturally protected hierarchies and the will of the rich and powerful. These rich and powerful people were usually old and WHITE, considering this was Europe.

&gt;No, that's authoritarianism. The two are often confused in the USA, but they are quite different. Fascism no more needs strong controls than socialism does.

Fascism and socialism BOTH require strong controls, correct. You are also right that it is authoritarianism but both of those systems (fascism and socialism) are inherently authoritarian. Why? They both promote CENTRALIZED power systems. Centralized is the key word as centralization of power is what leads to authoritarianism and complete control of the masses by a privileged few. This occurred in both Nazi Germany (fascist) and the Soviet Union (""socialist"" actually it was state capitalist but it was socialist for a few years so it still works)

&gt;Fascism is not national socialism, (Nazism) and you are slightly confusing the two.

Nazism is a form of fascism. There's a reason Germany, Italy, and Japan were allies. They were all pretty fascist.

&gt;This is not to say of course that Mussolini followed the stated manifesto, he was a nasty man, but the core tenets of fascism as a political idea are less nasty and more interesting than their recent implementation would imply.

Racism and ethnic superiority already exist within our ""moderate democratic society"" that we have now. The fascist ideology empowers these institutional hierarchies to their most extreme and that is why they naturally favor the dominating ethnic group of the region.

The people who started and are participating in drawing Mohammad are not doing it because we are bigoted against Arabs or Muslims. They are not doing it because they hate Muslims. They are doing it because someone drew a cartoon featuring Mohamed and in response some Muslims "" set fire to the Danish Embassies in Syria, Lebanon and Iran, stormed European buildings, And threatened to murder the man because he drew a fucking cartoon. (some religion of peace eh?) They are doing it because we wont' be scared by a group of thugs into not expressing ourselves. They are also doing it because we aren't fucking Muslims and don't feel the need to be subjected to Islamic law. We are not forbidden from drawing images of Mohammad they are. If they don't like the fact that we do it, they can exorcise their freedom of speech and say so. That is fine, but to partake in and incite violence and murder because you disagree with it is not Ok. If the 'peaceful' Muslims get offended as a result, big fucking deal. You act like its going to kill them. Surely you were taught as a child that ""Sticks and stones may break your bones, but words can never hurt you"". Besides where are these 'peaceful' Muslims speaking out against the violence? I haven't seen it. Sure violence is perfectly fine (as long as its against infidels) but draw a fucking cartoon character that is just too much right?

So you're saying that not a single person who participated in ""draw muhammad day"" was a bigot? Did you see how much of a ruckus it caused on stormfront.org? Give me a break. What you're saying is basically a no true scotsman fallacy, aka ""aha! But no true atheist (?) would ever draw Muhammad with the intention of insulting Muslims!""

,2,"&gt; Toward what end?

Who knows? But it's not the end that matters, it's whether the direction is good, and whether we can keep going sustainably. It's not hard to work out if we're doing something badly - you just have to look at the basic science or sociology underneath everything, and see if things are improving or not.. (e.g., we know we need to stop spewing out CO2 because we know it'll screw us up royally)

&gt; Don't let government hold the reins.

You're clearly an American. I don't mean that as an insult, but outside of the US, most other developed countries still have functional governments. The governments actually are representative of the people's will (for now anyway), and are populated with mostly reasonable people (though there are [clearly exceptions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott), and it's getting worse). So we can let government hold the reins, as they (broadly speaking) do as we tell them.

In the US, well.. Honestly, I don't know. You guys are totally screwed, and I say that with sympathy because I know it's not the fault of reasonable people (like yourself), and because it's not just people in the US who will feel the effects.

There's another thing: There is no structure in place that can replace government, so the obligation is to improve it as much as possible. That includes capitalism (which libertarians believe in), because that couldn't ever work as a substitute.

So what are we to do? The only thing we can do us rebuild our civic structures, and support those who are trying to do so.. And also try to put people on the path towards reconciliation, and all of those other frustratingly slow and difficult pathways.

In short - the US needs a dose of what you call ""socialism"" really, really badly. If you could head towards the European way of doing things you'd be *much* better off. And I think other Redditors know this (explicitly or implicitly), which is why you see then compensating for the very unbalanced pro-capitalist ideology.

Any such armed attack and all measures taken as a result thereof shall immediately be reported to the Security Council. Such measures shall be terminated when the Security Council has taken the measures necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security .

At the risk of sounding presumptuous, you have to see the U.S. from the perspective of a Guatemalan campesino, a Russian journalist, a Pakistani bricklayer, or even a French student who's not from the right family / may have had a bad day when taking his baccalaureate, and who has no chance of ever rising high in his own country.

Some of these have their dark side -- the latter, for example, often seems to come across as naiveté to outsider, or degenerates into the seeming black / white pandering that makes a Fox news so popular.  Likewise, all the liberties mean that there's less support for individuals who ""slip through the cracks"", while compensatory mechanisms have given rise to feeding at the trough and opportunism.  Part of it is also the disconnect between what people want the U.S. to be and what they perceive it to be -- which is why there's no contradiction between some moron teenager in Athens chanting ""death to America"" while wearing blue jeans.

,1,"Davide Pedersoli Howdah Pistol 
With twin barrels packing a one-two wallop, this big-bore Pistol was popular with Europeans exploring the vast jungles of India and Burma in the mid-1800s. On a typical excursion, explorers and soldiers were part of an elephant caravan. Riding on a howdah (the basket perched atop an elephant) may look safe in today's world, but a century ago danger was imminent. Tigers could scale the side of a slow-moving elephant in the blink of an eye. To combat surprise attacks, the Howdah-style side-by-side pistol was created. Two cavernous 20-gauge smoothbore barrels or .58-caliber rifled barrels can be loaded with buckshot, a single slug, or the devastating ""buck and ball""-load common in big-bore muzzleloaders used on dangerous game. Squeeze one of the triggers, and you'll appreciate the hand-conforming checkered walnut grip and the recoil-soaking end-cap counterweight. Its case-hardened lockplates are engraved with detailed wild animal scenes. Convert your Howdah pistol into a potent carbine by adding a detachable hardwood Shoulder Stock.

Analysis on the IHH, the organization responsible for the convoy, from the Danish Institute For International Studies (A very well-respected organization): http://www.diis.dk/graphics/Publications/WP2006/DIIS%20WP%202006-7.web.pdf

Here the following about IHH is reported on page 10: 

&gt; Yet, the phenomenon of charitable front groups that provide support to Al-Qaida is by no
means exclusively limited to the Arabian Peninsula. Indeed, elsewhere in the Muslim world,
other such entities have been established with near equal success – as in Turkey, with the socalled
Foundation for Human Rights, Liberties, and Humanitarian Relief (IHH). Turkish
authorities began their own domestic criminal investigation of IHH as early as December
1997, when sources revealed that leaders of IHH were purchasing automatic weapons from other regional Islamic militant groups.43 IHH’s bureau in Istanbul was thoroughly searched,
and its local officers were arrested. **Security forces uncovered an array of disturbing items,
including firearms, explosives, bomb-making instructions, and a “jihad flag.” After analyzing
seized IHH documents, Turkish authorities concluded that “detained members of IHH were
going to fight in Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Chechnya.”**


&gt; According to a French intelligence report, the terrorist infiltration of IHH extended to its
most senior ranks. The report, written by famed counterterrorism magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguiere,
revealed that IHH President Bulent Yildrim had directly conspired in the mid-1990s to
“recruit veteran soldiers in anticipation of the coming holy war [jihad]. In particular, some
men were sent into war zones in Muslim countries in order to acquire combat experience.”
Furthermore, in the hopes of “obtaining political support from these countries, financial aid
was transferred [on behalf of IHH], as well as caches of firearms, knives, and pre-fabricated
explosives.” **An examination of IHH’s phone records in Istanbul showed repeated telephone
calls in 1996 to an Al-Qaida guesthouse in Milan and various Algerian terrorist operatives
active elsewhere in Europe – including the notorious Abu el-Ma`ali, who has been subsequently
termed by U.S. officials as a “junior Osama Bin Laden.”**
During the later Seattle trial of would-be Al-Qaida Millenium bomber Ahmed Ressam, federal
prosecutors called French magistrate Bruguiere to the stand as an expert witness. **Bruguiere testified that IHH had played “[a]n important role” in the Al-Qaida Millenium bomb plot
targeting LAX. Under repeated questioning, Bruguiere insisted that “[t]here’s a rather close
relation”**

And there's more of IHH's dubious activities in the report.

- They maintained their presence there for thousands of years and maintained a majority in Jerusalem
- The local Arabs living there never had a state. There was no existing political entity of any sort, as they were just seen as a distant province of other bigger empires.
- The Jews were persecuted horrendously for around 2000 years. (I know the pro-Palestinians will want to say that now they're doing it to the Palestinians but really, there's no comparison, and the Palestinians are suffering only for constantly choosing the path of terrorism)

[They will not let the Concorde compete against the A380](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/branson-denied-concorde-information-596117.html).

&gt;That is what Richard Branson owner of Virgin Airlines said and he was right.

&gt;""""If BA wants to stop flying Concorde, that's its commercial decision. I have no problem with that,"" he said. ""But in the circumstances, why should that stop someone else from having a go at keeping this beautiful aircraft in the air?

That was no longer an issue. That retrofit was already approved and all Concordes had been retrofitted and the Concorde had reentered commercial service. That crash had NOTHING to do with it being shutdown.

Remember the Concorde flies faster and higher for a sustained period than ANY FIGHTER JET. It flies faster than Mach 2. Most fighter jets only fly up to mach 2 and none can do it as long as the Concorde.

I am in Europe now and I literally ran into an American cop from Texas and he threatened me, pushed me against the wall and said 'I am a peace officer from the state of Texas!'

,2,"&gt; *Designated the jewish ""homeland""

This is the most wtf part of the entire process, I believe. Normally...you can't just have a bunch of refugees move to a place and then decide that it was theirs all along. 
This decision was influenced as:
* Jews were screwed over by holocaust, and people felt sorry for them. It had been shown (to the Jews, at least) that their way of living- scattered across Europe- made them vulnerable. They didn't want to go home. The Jews were in a good position to ask for big favors from the world- had this occurred at any other time in history, *I* doubt the state of Israel would've been established. 
* ""Home"" was outlined in Torah- awesome! One problem: ""Home"" was only meant to be their home again when the Messiah came. The UN isn't the Messiah. Somehow, this does not bother Jews. (This is pretty much the Zionist/Anti-Zionist argument- Zionists think it's ok to wait for the Messiah in the land that the Messiah is meant to give to them, while Anti-Zionists (often &gt; Orthodox) want to wait.)

Then:  
UN vote legitimized the Israeli state. (Not the UN as we know it; even more dominated by a few powerful nations.) 
 On this note: the territory proclaimed  Israel were significant in two ways:
1. In the Torah, what we know was Israel/Palestine is composed of two regions; Judea and Samaria. The Jews were given the land of Samaria, which was uncool. Judea is a far more sacred land for the Jews than Samaria. (Remember the Good Samaritan? Yeah, that guy was from Samaria.) So, from the word go, the Jews had a reason to want more territory. This is less significant than…
2. The territory ""Israel"" had two chunks of territory joined by a little skinny bit of territory. This was strategically crap. 

&gt;*Forcing out of Palestinians 

This is a war. And a highly romanticized war. I've been to a museum in Israel that paints this conflict as good, young, attractive Jewish refugees/holocaust survivors (a force known as the Palmach) fighting nobly for their new homeland, and somehow failing to murder any Palestinians in the process. It really scared me that this was the history Israeli kids were studying.      

One of the justifications the Israelis used was that the Palestinians were not really using the land- they were 'nomadic', and anyway the Jews were more educated, had some money, and would be able to make the country ""great"". 

I hope this helps somewhat- my grandparents moved to Israel around this time, and this debate happens a lot at home. Other than this, I deny any authority on the subject.

,2,"That was incredibly helpful! My flatmate returned home just now as I was reading through some Wiki articles on this. She is well-versed on politics and cultural history, and elaborated on many of these points.

As far as I can now gather:

Waaaay back, the Jewish people were hounded out of their homeland due to their faith being lowest in the pecking order of a theistically diverse region. While they were essentially arabs, the diaspora led to 'Jewish' being identified as an ethnic line with no homeland, that Jews see as having meaning beyond simple religion. The people that remained were essentially the same people, but not exiled due to their faith.

Come 1948, when everyone acknowledged that the Jews had suffered horrifically throughout the war (which of course they had), Europe grants the demand of a nation state for Jews. The problem being, in hindsight, that they really should have been a movement to return to the land to intergrate in a more tolerant political atmosphere. But this is 1948.

Over the decades, Israel is either granted more land by European interests that have land in the area to give, or they take land by force and no nation wants to condemn them. Global guilt, keeping an ally in an oil-rich area, Jewish interests in other countries persuading foreign policy - all seem to be factors here.

With nobody condemning them, Israel have continued to take the land they want for agriculture, residential and general expansionist purposes. The people who have been occupying this land for centuries, possibly descendants of the people that shared the land with the Jews before they were driven out, are now being forcefully removed. The abused child has become the abuser.

The thought this leaves me with is that their behaviour is indeed worthy of condemnation but their location and alliances with other powerful countries sees a good portion of the world rather sitting out of the argument.

I'll go and check out the 'IAMA zionist' post that recently appeared and hear another perspective on this.

That's all fine. If you want to lawfully emigrate to Palestine (as the original Zionists did), I don't have an issue with that. Actually, since the immigrant Jews in Palestine had superior knowledge and access to capital, they were already outclassing the locals in prosperity and influence, well before 1948. If you had wanted to do this in a lawful way respectful of the local population's traditions and legal rights none of this crap would have happened.

I don't see why your claims obligated the rest of us to help you (formerly European and North American jewry) establish a country in the Middle East, supplanting the people who'd been there continuously for thousands of years. The Palestinians almost certainly have more Jewish blood in them than any Europeans claiming the right of return. The only problem is that they are the descendants of Jews who converted to Islam. So suddenly their claim to the land doesn't count? That's what convinces me this isn't about nationhood, it's about religion and myth.

There are people out there who are completely convinced they are reincarnated inhabitants of Atlantis. This doesn't obligate the rest of us to give them a territory. The Jewish claim to Palestine seems very similar to me. Some Europeans who consider themselves Jewish wanted a territory in a land no ancestor of theirs had seen for thousands of years, because a book said so. Given the way human genetics works, they probably had an equally sound claim on Mongolia. But the world went along with it.

The Zionist claim seems wholly unlike, for instance, the Kurds' claim to a Kurdistan, where we have a people well defined in ethnicity and culture and politics, continuously living in the same area for millenia. So they probably do have a Wilsonian claim to need self-determination.

Jewishness (to me) seems to be a religion and a tradition, definitely unique in the European experience.

First and for all, German banks have been bailed out just as well : they are also holding a massive amounts of Greek debt that they would have had to write off without prior intervention of the IMF and the European Union. Since that debt is now as good as guaranteed by entities other than Greece there is little to no penalty for them in holding on to them (which is why they made the voluntary agreement to do so in the first place). 

In fact, keeping them allows the German banks to cash in on the interest rates they are getting on the bonds. Interest rates that are now proportionally much higher than the risk they are running on those bonds. Interest rates that became high because Germany kept prolonging and putting into question the original bailout. Without that unnecessary drawing out, Greece would either have bankrupted much sooner (without loading up on billions of debt at unsustainable rates each month) or would have been bailed out sooner (also without having to load up on billions of debt at the rates of March-April-May)

Germany needs to take a good hard look at itself as well. Why is it going cavalier seul on important measures disrupting markets of its closest partners? Why is it talking down the Euro without admitting to doing so? Why is it doing nothing to support domestic demand? Why is it so silent on the fact that it breached the European stability pack on government debt and deficit already back in 2003 and together with France bullied the others into shelving punitive action against themselves?

,1,"&gt; Are you trolling? They do share a language (Hebrew),

Well, Hebrew was revived in a rather stunning manner by modern Israelis, but previously... not so much. They shared Hebrew in the same way that Catholics share Latin.

&gt; They obviously share an ""ethnicity"", as well, but that's tautological.

I don't think it's that obvious. But the term is debatable.

&gt; It's actually been an universally accepted fact for thousands of years. Accepted by both Jews and Gentiles.

I agree it's been a universally accepted fact. But how real is it? Jews have gone through periods of integration and then apartness, with the waning and waxing of anti-Semitism in Europe. I think that as a matter of reality, European-descended Jews are way more European than they are Middle Eastern.

Does it make sense to call Jewry an ethnicity when some of them are blond and blue-eyed, some are swarthy and dark haired, and some of them have black skin and Afro hair? When they haven't lived on the same *continent* for thousands of years? It's vitally important for the national claim to think of them as a single ethnicity, but by any normal definition, they aren't.

Does it make sense that a blond, blue-eyed Jew from Northern Europe has more of a claim on some land in the Middle East than a an olive-skinned, black-haired guy who has family records going back at least a couple of hundred years?

I agree that Jewry is way more than ""just"" a religion -- it's in some category of its own, a very strong culture and tradition handed down through families, with some isolation (but not total isolation) from the local population, that is *perceived* as a separate ethnicity.

Latin and the Catholic Church have a *very* different history, and if you know anything about it, you'll know that there's no real comparison. It's more like Irish, or Belarussian - national languages that were rarely used, but still remembered by many.

I wasn't the one who said other countries would use nukes. I was responding to **you saying that Israel might nuke a 500 ship flotilla of foreign aid ships**.

Labour MEP for Dublin [,Ireland]

Tuesday 1st June 2010

 

ATTORNEY GENERAL SHOULD PREPARE A CASE AGAINST ISRAELI MINISTERS FOR PROSECUTION IN THE IRISH COURTS

 

Labour MEP Proinsias De Rossa has announced a special meeting of the European Parliament Delegation to Palestine, which he chairs, to discuss the Israeli armed attack on the humanitarian aid convoy with the deaths of 9 people.

 

Both Palestinian and Israeli diplomats will be present to address the meeting. All reports indicate that the convoy was up to 400 Kilometres from Israel at the time of the attack, and that the ships were unarmed.

 

Mr. De Rossa stated that there was a prima facie case for legal action by member states against Israel for kidnapping their citizens and for the use of disproportionate and illegal armed force against shipping in international waters, from which there was no obvious threat. ""I urge the Irish government to instruct the Attorney General to prepare a case against Israel under the Geneva Conventions for hearing in Irish courts"", he said.

 

""It is obvious that this latest breach of international law by Israel requires a response which goes beyond the usual rhetoric and handwringing. Member States and the EU have the economic wherewithal to make it clear to the Israeli government that we will no longer accept such tactics from a state which prides itself as being part of the community of democratic states. The EU trade agreement with Israel should be suspended, as should the transfer of any moneys from EU programmes such as the 7th Research and Development programme.

 

While I welcome the various calls from the EU and the UN for an independent enquiry into the assault on the convoy, it must be clear by now that this enquiry has to be an International enquiry. An enquiry by Israel of it self, by itself, would not be credible, given its response to the findings of the Goldstone Report on the Israeli war on Gaza over a year ago which cost the lives of over 300 children.

 

Equally an enquiry which confines itself to the actions of the soldiers would be inadequate. This is not simply a question of soldiers overreacting. It is clear that Israel has a doctrine of using disproportionate force, which puts civilians at grave risk. This was the finding of the Goldstone report when it identified the heavy loss of civilian life, not as a consequence of soldiers being in breach of orders, but as a consequence of following orders from the highest political level. Consequently an enquiry must also seek to establish the political responsibility for this latest and needless loss of life.",worldnews,0,0,True,6,1426327352,False,BakersDozen,,c0r6rzc,False,0,t5_2qh13,1275407256,,t1_c0r6rzc,t3_ca6s6,t3_ca6s6

&gt; “Remember what Amalek did to you,” cautioned Netanyahu, quoting a particularly ominous passage from Deuteronomy. “I have come here today from Jerusalem to tell you: We will never forget. We will not allow the Holocaust deniers or those who desecrate [Jewish] graves and signs to erase or distort [our] memory.”

&gt; The prime minister also warned that though the “Nazi Amalek” was almost entirely a ghost of the past, “a new Amalek is appearing and once again threatening to annihilate the Jews. We will not allow it ... We will never forget and always stand guard,” he said.

&gt; “Murderous hatred must be stopped in its tracks, stopped right from the beginning. All countries in the world must learn this lesson, just as we did after losing a third of our people in blood-soaked Europe. We learned that the only guarantee for the protection of our people is the State of Israel and its army, the IDF,” Netanyahu declared, warning that never again would the existence of Israel and the Jewish people be threatened.

Hamas, the Taliban and so on don't care about it and will never accept it. In which case, why should their opponents? In fact I agree with Robert Kagan that and Robert Cooper

http://www.newamericancentury.org/kagan-20020520.htm

&gt; The current situation abounds in ironies. Europe’s rejection of power politics, its devaluing of military force as a tool of international relations, have depended on the presence of American military forces on European soil. Europe’s new Kantian order could flourish only under the umbrella of American power exercised according to the rules of the old Hobbesian order. American power made it possible for Europeans to believe that power was no longer important. And now, in the final irony, the fact that United States military power has solved the European problem, especially the “German problem,” allows Europeans today to believe that American military power, and the “strategic culture” that has created and sustained it, are outmoded and dangerous. 
&gt;
&gt; Most Europeans do not see the great paradox: that their passage into post-history has depended on the United States not making the same passage. Because Europe has neither the will nor the ability to guard its own paradise and keep it from being overrun, spiritually as well as physically, by a world that has yet to accept the rule of “moral consciousness,” it has become dependent on America’s willingness to use its military might to deter or defeat those around the world who still believe in power politics.
&gt;
&gt; Some Europeans do understand the conundrum. Some Britons, not surprisingly, understand it best. Thus Robert Cooper writes of the need to address the hard truth that although “within the postmodern world [i.e., the Europe of today], there are no security threats in the traditional sense,” nevertheless, throughout the rest of the world — what Cooper calls the “modern and pre-modern zones” — threats abound. If the postmodern world does not protect itself, it can be destroyed. But how does Europe protect itself without discarding the very ideals and principles that undergird its pacific system? 
&gt;
&gt; “The challenge to the postmodern world,” Cooper argues, “is to get used to the idea of double standards.” Among themselves, Europeans may “operate on the basis of laws and open cooperative security.” But when dealing with the world outside Europe, “we need to revert to the rougher methods of an earlier era — force, preemptive attack, deception, whatever is necessary.” This is Cooper’s principle for safeguarding society: “Among ourselves, we keep the law but when we are operating in the jungle, we must also use the laws of the jungle.” 
&gt;
&gt; Cooper’s argument is directed at Europe, and it is appropriately coupled with a call for Europeans to cease neglecting their defenses, “both physical and psychological.” But what Cooper really describes is not Europe’s future but America’s present. For it is the United States that has had the difficult task of navigating between these two worlds, trying to abide by, defend, and further the laws of advanced civilized society while simultaneously employing military force against those who refuse to abide by those rules. The United States is already operating according to Cooper’s double standard, and for the very reasons he suggests. American leaders, too, believe that global security and a liberal order — as well as Europe’s “postmodern” paradise — cannot long survive unless the United States does use its power in the dangerous, Hobbesian world that still flourishes outside Europe.
&gt;
&gt; What this means is that although the United States has played the critical role in bringing Europe into this Kantian paradise, and still plays a key role in making that paradise possible, it cannot enter this paradise itself. It mans the walls but cannot walk through the gate. The United States, with all its vast power, remains stuck in history, left to deal with the Saddams and the ayatollahs, the Kim Jong Ils and the Jiang Zemins, leaving the happy benefits to others.

Let me see if I understand your argument:

* That because of the hostile policies of Post WWII Europe, the Jews were forced to move into the British Mandate of Palestine and _nowhere else_.  

* That the Jewish paramilitary groups operating in the British Mandate had no choice but to help Jews fleeing Europe illegally immigrate to Palestine and nowhere else as a matter of survival.

* That because Britain enacted immigration policies that reflected the goals as mandated by the League of Nations to create a home for both the Jews and the Arabs living there, respecting the rights and cultures of both populations, and because Britain refused to abandon their immigration policy without a solution agreeable to both populations, the Jewish leaders impatience justified the Baltimore declaration and the subsequent paramilitary attacks on British forces.

* That the Arabs shoulder the blame for the failure of the UN Partition Plan, which would have given control of 56% of the land to a Jewish 33% minority that before had only legally owned 7%, with much of the land allocated to the Arabs not being suitable for agriculture.  Under this proposal, 45% of the Arab population would have been living in Jewish territory, subject to being treated as second-class citizens. 

* That given the Arab unwillingness to cooperate, there was no choice but to declare independence and claim the land as their own. Despite a vast majority of Jewish settlers having no real ties to Palestine while the Arab settlers had been burying their dead there for hundreds, even thousands of years, had stayed with their land and converted to Islam rather than fleeing it, and had a 2 to 1 population majority.

* That the Jewish settlers had to settle in Palestine because of persecution in Europe, and this justifies their actions up to and after declaring their independence as necessary for the survival of the Jewish nation.  And this justification isn't some sick joke given the end result of the Arab-Israeli war, which displaced 750,000 Palestinians from their land, most of them civilians expelled or fleeing from the violence.

* So in closing, the Jewish right of return and self-determination is greater than the right of the Palestinians to return and achieve self-determination on the land that was rightfully theirs.  Because shit rolls downhill.

&gt;Today, Kurdish is an official language in Iraq. In Syria, on the other hand, publishing material in Kurdish is forbidden.[14]  Before August 2002, the Turkish government placed severe restrictions on the use of Kurdish, prohibiting the language in education and broadcast media.[15][16]  The Kurdish alphabet is still not recognized in Turkey, and the use of Kurdish names containing the letters X, W, and Q, which do not exist in the Turkish alphabet, is not allowed. Kurdish education in private institutions is allowed in Turkey, but there has been little demand for these courses.

&gt;In Iran, though it is used in some local media and newspapers, it is not used in public schools.[17][18] In 2005, 80 Iranian Kurds took part in an experiment and gained scholarships to study in Kurdish in Iraqi Kurdistan.[19]

&gt;In March 2006, Turkey allowed private television channels to begin airing programming in the Kurdish language. However, the Turkish government said that they must avoid showing children's cartoons, or educational programs that teach the Kurdish language, and could broadcast only for 45 minutes a day or four hours a week.[20] However, most of these restrictions on private Kurdish television channels were relaxed in September 2009.[21]

&gt;The state-run Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT) started its 24-hour Kurdish television station on 1 January 2009 with the motto “we live under the same sky.”[22] The Turkish Prime Minister sent a video message in Kurdish to the opening ceremony, which was attended by Minister of Culture and other state officials. The channel uses the controversial X, W, Q letters during broadcasting.

&gt;Other Kurdish satellite televisions are available in the Middle East and Europe.

&gt;Kurdish blogs have emerged in recent years as virtual fora where Kurdish-speaking Internet users can express themselves in their native Kurdish or in other languages.

That is the semi-official, polished Istanbul version, which has improved since I crawled under my rock before 2006. But out in the provinces where the western news cameras seldom go... as recently as 2009 about 100 secondary students and their parents were arrested and charged with sedition for petitioning for their legal but seldom granted right to school classes in their native Kurdish language.

&gt;A book isn't a legal right to a land. 

No shit.  Believe it or not though, I can point to a number of historians that will support my claim that the kingdom of Israel DID exist.  It isn't like the bible says that the Kingdom of Israel exists and everyone else denies it.

&gt;If you're referring to the BC Israel (Herod the Great), that's hardly the same country.

Depends on who you ask.  

&gt;Italy doesn't have claim to all of Europe just because Rome used to occupy that land.

My stance is that the kingdom of Israel DID exist prior to '47.  This quote of yours refutes that how?

&gt;These days, after the 4th Geneva Convention (which specifies that you cannot keep land after the end of a war), things don't work that way.

Really?  So you are telling me that no borders have been defined by military conflict since the 4th Geneva Convention?  I just want to make sure I'm clear on this before I start to talk shit.  I mean, anyone with a basic knowledge of history can come up with a few borders off the top of their head that have been decided based on conflict after the 4th Geneva convention.  You can say it SHOULDN'T be this way, but the reality is that is DOES happen.

&gt;They issued a mandate that made the state of Palestine. Later on, they gave some land to displaced Jews as well. That's where this history legally ends, in 1948.

That isn't the same as saying that the state of Palestine existed before the state of Israel.  For example, say I draw up a document saying that a country called Country X will be created in 2020.  Then, prior to 2020, I throw away the other piece of paper and create a new one saying that Country X and Country Y will be created in 2020.  That doesn't mean that Country X existed before Country Y.  

Now if you still think that the country of Palestine existed before Israel, then give me some key dates to back that up.  Give me the date that the British mandate ended.  Give me the date that Palestine was officially founded and recognized.  Give me the date that Israel was officially founded and recognized.  I could be wrong, but you will need to support it with some facts.

The only way Turkey keeps Northern Iraq stable is by not going after their enemy.  If they were to send forces across the border (which they have done since 2003), they would potentially destabilize the relatively peaceful north.

,1,"&gt;That is a separate issue and until it is cleared up, it's stupid to try to violate it and ignore it. Israel will defend it until someone convinces them they don't have the authority. I don't see that happening any time soon.

It is a fairly important aspect of this and I believe part of what the activists are trying to highlight.  This incident brings it to the fore and may well put pressure on Israel (and introduce popular pressure on it's allies) to re-examine the whole situation in a somewhat new light.

&gt;It's pretty damn sensible. The people resisted the boarding party and were fighting back.

Except that the boarding party were the attackers, they weren't 'fighting back' they initiated the aggression (through boarding) and then escalated the whole mess by using lethal force.

&gt;That is meaningless in determine legality. For israel it is a crime. Their soldiers enforce israeli laws. Israel controls gaza and has imposed a blockade.

It is meaningful in the sense that Israel did indeed act in a disproportionate manner, in a manner that a lot of people will find outrageous.  In short it damages Israel and makes them look like the aggressor rather than the victim or what you could call an intent to incite.  

&gt;Legally Israel as a right to stop any ship intending to violate the blockade. There is no argument there.

Well, they have a right to deal with any ship within their territorial waters, that much is true, if the blockade is unlawful though, then this act was unlawful.  Moreover, whilst it might be argued that Israel had the right to deter those intending to run the blockade, the way they did so is questionable at best.

&gt;But it is legal, since Israel controls gaza.

But Israels sovereignty and the authority it holds is limited to the usual land area and surrounding waters, it does not arbitrarily extend to anywhere they want.

&gt;Post law of the sea. I don't see how there can be any default laws in international waters. What courts and police enforce them?

The Law of the Sea is a collection of treaties usually abbreviated to the title I gave, you can take a look at [this](http://www.un.org/Depts/los/index.htm) for more detail.  It is what regulates international activities at sea and how breaches are dealt with will depend on the breach as much as anything else.  

&gt;The facts are if israel controls gaza, their blockade is legal and boarding ships intending to violate the blockade is legal. Shooting those that fight back is also legal.

Even if we assume that everything is legal (which I doubt) it would be fair to say that it is in Israels interests to act in a way that is not only legal, but visibly moral.  Shooting 'back' after boarding a vessel isn't, that is why Israel is facing condemnation now.

&gt;You don't have to like it, but that is reality. You can't argue with reality. You can change it if you want by force or diplomatic bullshit, but the current reality is that israel controls it.

No, of course not.  But then you can say that what Israel is doing is wrong and should be stopped. You could even go as far as to suggest military intervention (as with US operations in Iraq) is justified. The point is that it is in Israels best interests to play nice and to stop doing things that are both inhumane and generally considered unlawful. The amount of protection that Israel has in the form of US support may well be on the decline, moreover it may not protect them against popular opinion in Europe and Asia.

&gt;People need to stop saying a country has no right to blah blah blah just because they fundamentally are deciding that israel does not control gaza. That has no bearing on what a country can and cannot do in it's own territory and for it's own defense. These are separate issues.

They are separate issues, but there are limits on what countries can do within the areas that they control or occupy, Israel cannot be allowed to continue to act as a pariah and violate the very fundamental things that most of the world sees as inviolable.

What we need to do is build and train for the conflicts we are in *right now*. If we couple this with an increase in intelligence gathering (a fraction of the cost), we will be able to adapt to new threats before they materialize.

Why aren't we doing this? Because of a) our 'mandate' and b) pressure from defense contractors. Companies make obscene amounts of money delivering a new fleet of aircraft to the millitary. What makes it so expensive is the actual building of the weapons - if we only paid for R&amp;D until we needed the plane or gun or ship, we would be able to drastically slash costs while still maintaining a modern arsenal.

These decisions, just like the corn-ethanol debacle here in America, may mean a few more cents on the dollar for us in the developed world, but bankruptcy and starvation for people who only make a few dollars a month in undeveloped countries.  People whose heating oil will now be just expensive enough that they might not survive.  Hell, it's been estimated that over a million people have starved to death due to shortages because of the government's subsidization of large amounts of corn for ethanol instead of using it for aid.  How many more might die because of the higher price of heating oil after cap-and-trade?  This isn't just a scholarly debate anymore.

&gt;His presentation of standard science as observing laws is nonsense of course. But Rothbard is quite clear that in his view praxeology consists of starting with known truths and using deduction to produce answers. Utter and complete nonsense.

We'll have to agree to disagree on whether Rothbard's views are 'nonsense,' but how do you think scientific experimentation evolves?  Not by deduction, but by positing--testing hypotheses.  This works just fine for hard sciences, for which the variables can be known.  In the social sciences, you still have not shown me how it is possible to account for all the variables in play and still maintain any sort of coherent hypothesis.  The very statistical models that mainstream economists used did not predict the Crash of '09 any more than they predicted the crash that led to the Great Depression.

As I've said before (though you've not listened), the problem is not with the scientific method, but where it's applied--social sciences simply are not given to rigorous scientific controls.

Before Zionism, the region of the southern Beirut province and the Jerusalem special administrative zone was relatively sparsely populated, due to the fact that most of the land was not arable using traditional methods of the region.  The European Zionists brought chemical fertilizer, iron plows, horse collars, tractors, chemical pesticides, and modern drainage techniques which allowed the cultivation of previously unarable lands - cultivation which was originally performed by Arab laborers earning several times what they might performing similar work near Damascus.

It's incredibly difficult to draw completely accurate conclusions, of course, because the Ottoman censuses were notoriously unreliable, and the British performed all of **one** real census during the Mandate.

,1,"The argument is that the ships in question were threatening to invade what is still legally Israeli territory. Therefore, Israel didn't actually have to wait for the ships to invade its territory to act in self-defense.

Think of it this way; if someone is standing on the sidewalk in front of your house, pacing back and forth and threatening to charge in, and you have reason to fear for your safety or, say, that of your kids, you have the right to subdue that person.

So there's a valid legal argument in favor of Israel's right to board those ships.

The trouble is that there's no legal standard that I know of that justifies using violent force in such a situation. You are allowed to use self-defense to *subdue* in many situations in which you are not allowed to use it to *kill*. You have to have, essentially, a reasonable fear for your or someone else's life *and* a reasonable suspicion that other methods of self-defense are inadequate for the situation in order to justify such a response.

Israel's going to have trouble doing that. The ideal situation from Israel's point of view is it's somehow proven that the ships were firing at Israel. But a response where ten people were killed and half the people on board seem to have been injured seems difficult to justify as merely self-defense against guys with sticks and kitchen knives. You can over-step your right to self-defense pretty easily; if someone is no longer a threat and you continue to attack them, you're no longer covered.

Now Israel clearly didn't order this actual attack. It's not in their interests, and the fact that it only happened in the raid on one of six ships says pretty clearly to me that someone got nervous and started shooting. But Israel (and now America, unfortunately) is acting to cover it up. This is particularly fucked up since Turkey is a member of NATO and thus we are obliged to aid them in this situation; their nationals have been attacked in Europe. Expect them to invoke the charter in the near future. And it's almost a lock that every other member of the treaty except for us will back them.

This is a bad situation all around. Turkey alone is actually way more important than Israel strategically, but it's not just going to be Turkey. We could lose the entire EU over this.

Germany could have been broken up by the allies, but again, they would have fought much longer.

In israel's case they were attacked.  They won and had troops on the northern front and southern front.  When they won the war, the troops stayed put and these became the new borders.  A very very fair win and land grab.  They have a right to protect themselves from neighbors that attack them and buffer zones help do that.

If the countries around israel didn't want to lose land, they should not have fought.  Can you imagine if the won?  They would have slaughtered all the jews and taken all of israel.

,2,"Ok, here a a few points:

- it makes Swiss bank accounts look responsible for all tax evasion. But if you look more closely, it says that 3 trillion are deposited in Swiss bank accounts and that tax evasion is 'worth 135 trillion'. This means that even if most of the money deposited in Switzerland is not properly taxed (which is not true), it would still be only responsible for a tiny fraction of all tax evasion.

- The left column is about tax havens, which has nothing to do with Swiss bank accounts. There are companies (the mentioned example is pepsico) that move to Switzerland, Ireland, Eastern Europe or other low-tax countries because these countries have low tax rates. I'm not saying this is morally correct, but it has nothing to do with Swiss bank secrecy.

- Due to the enormous pressure put on Swiss banks, most of them don't accept American customers any more, even if they prove that they pay their taxes properly. The legal risk is just too high. This is expecially cumbersome for American citizens working or living in Switzerland. It is an absurd situation and looks to me like a symptom of a witch hunt.

- There are plenty of ways to avoid taxes (go to Delaware, the Bahamas, the Isle of Man, Singapore, etc. etc.). Ikea for example uses a Dutch Stichting (foundation) to do so. The real myth is that tax evasion could be prevented by disallowing Swiss bank accounts. Considering the large difference in criticism Swiss banks receive, and the criticism British or American tax shelters like the Isle of Man get, I wonder what the motives behind campaigns like the above one are. It is in the interest of American and British banks to weaken their Swiss competitors.

- The holocaust part is the worst. There are no 'massive quantities of nazi gold' in Swiss bank accounts (that's also why they state it with a question mark). After the second world war, stolen money and nazi assets have been returned to help rebuild Europe and all claims settled in an international agreement. The graph 'forgets' to mention this. Also, it does not mention that 20% of the 1.25£ of the mentioned settlement with the jewish campaign group went to the campaign group itself and their lawyers. Also, it took the campaign group many more years than planned to distribute the money because they couldn't find as many legitimate victims as they thought, even though they relaxed the criteria for receiving money again and again.

* It pretends to be a cost of living index. It isn't. It's a price index of a basket of goods, weighed after what 'the average american'  buys, and including some dubious estimates. 

* Owner Equivalent Rent is a farce. If somebody takes a 20-year mortgage, his shelter costs are flat for 20 years. To take that effect into account, you should incorporate all the refinanced mortgages into account.  There's no way to do that in a way that isn't a massive onslaught on everybodies privacy. 

* hedonic indices are dubious. For example, take the PC thing: PC's get deflated with their specs (which increase over time with lowering costs).  OK if you think as PC's as an item: you get a better item for the same price (more MHz/GHz, more ram, more disk).  It's not OK if you think as PC's as service: Word perfect was good enough for writing a memo.  The wizzbang of Word  isn't something that should result in a 10% adjustment of your PC costs. Ditto matrix-printed forms and laserprinted forms: for some uses, a matrix print was good enough.  

* You can have different expenditure distributions. Increases in the price of beer and pizza have a much higher impact on students than on other people (to take an example).  In europe, wage negotiations are usually based on the *national* CPI, not on the expenses of people working in a particular sector/particular region, which can differ a lot.

* status changes: the value that people give to some things can vary a lot, overnight.

&gt;Cute.

I'll take that as a concession, dearie. 

&gt;Israel launched a preemptive strike against egypt. 

In other words, Israel attacked Egypt and started the War. 

&gt;One of the reason israel won that war is because of the preemptive strike.

The war they started. None of the other countries wanted a war at that stage. 

&gt;Had they not done that, jews would have been exterminated from the earth and the airbase countries would have take the land israel is on today.

There is no reason to believe that the Arab countries were going to attack or exterminate anybody. From the wikipedia entry on the 67 war:

&gt;Yitzhak Rabin, who served as the Chief of the General Staff for Israel during the war stated: ""I do not believe that Nasser wanted war. The two divisions he sent into Sinai on May 14 would not have been enough to unleash an offensive against Israel. He knew it and we knew it."" Menachem Begin stated that ""The Egyptian army concentrations in the Sinai approaches did not prove that Nasser was really about to attack us. We must be honest with ourselves. We decided to attack him."" [76] Former Chief of Staff of the armed forces, Haim Bar-Lev (a deputy chief during the war) had stated: ""the entrance of the Egyptians into Sinai was not a casus belli,"" but argued instead that the Egyptian blockade of the Straits of Tiran ultimately caused the war. Major General Mattityahu Peled, the Chief of Logistics for the Armed Forces during the war, said the survival argument was ""a bluff which was born and developed only after the war... ...""When we spoke of the war in the General Staff, we talked of the political ramifications if we didn't go to war —what would happen to Israel in the next 25 years. Never of survival today."" [77] Peled also stated that ""To pretend that the Egyptian forces massed on our frontiers were in a position to threaten the existence of Israel constitutes an insult not only to the intelligence of anyone capable of analyzing this sort of situation, but above all an insult to Zahal (Israeli military)[78]""

And Israel in its current form does not deserve to exist. Its an apartheid-like European colony on Arab soil that was built on the ethnic cleansing of the native people. It needs to be abolished.

,1,"There is an actual debate. It's not a scientific one, it's one in our collective public consciousness. That's the debate Dawkins is participating in. At this stage in his career, he's not acting as a scientist, but as an advocate of science.

There's a wave of anti-intellectualism that's sweeping western countries (mostly the U.S. and Australia, but to a lesser degree in Europe as well) and it's fueled by people's poor understanding of the state of science, and their susceptibility to memes which hold little to no truth value.

As for your criticism that I'm labeling my beliefs by contrasting them to the beliefs of others, of course I am. That's how you get specific with your beliefs. That's what everyone does. A socialist defines his beliefs in contrast to the libertarian by making the assertion that the free market is not a universal fix and that there are certain services the government must perform to protect the interests of the people, and a libertarian does something similar regarding the overarching power of government.

I don't contrast my view on a round earth to those who believe it is flat because that meme has been marginalized in our society to the point where it's not a tenable position for people in the media or politics to hold. Unfortunately, the meme of science denial hasn't.

If you're acting like there's no actual debate about the role of science in our society, and no debate about the legitimacy of certain scientifically proven theories, you're deluding yourself.

,7,"I can't speak for anyone else here, but I can tell you that when I heard about it, I was so angry that I was shaking.  And I can also tell you, that I don't hate Israel.

My ""bias"" stems from the fact that 62 years ago my country voted to establish two states in Palestine.  What we now have is one ridiculously powerful state, dominated by white Europeans, and then a group of impoverished dis-empowered Arabs.

For the past 40 years, my country, and the rest of the Western world, has applauded everything the Israelis did, and demonized everything the Arabs did.  We spent 30 years calling their leadership terrorists, until we were able to figure out a way of putting them under our thumb. Now, when the Palestinians have turned away from the leadership we've corrupted, we now spend our time demonizing their new leaders.  All the while, Israel the good is slowly swallowing up land that international law has called occupied.

My ""bias"" doesn't stem from any hatred of the Israelis, it's due to the fact that I want the Palestinians to have their own state.  I feel the blockade of Gaza is illegal and immoral.  The fact that a group of activists ended up dead, instead of docking in Gaza and embracing the Palestinians in friendship and peace, made me very angry.  It had nothing to do with any hatred of Israelis.

Just because I believe that sanctions should be instituted against Israel until they pull back to the Green Line - at which point negotiations should begin - doesn't mean I hate Israel.  It just means that I think what Israel is doing is wrong, and I believe our unconditional support of Israel over the years was wrong.

,1,"&gt;No, the ship fully intended to violate israeli waters and go through the blockade. No one on the ship disputes this. You need to accept this fact.

I am not disputing it.

&gt;Israel has a right to police it's borders and enforce it's blockade. Just like the US, france, britain, russia, japan, china, etc.

I agree, indeed I would suggest that they have a duty to do so.  However their border is nowhere near where the ships were attacked, indeed it would seem that their border was at least 30 miles distant by the shortest route and more than double that distant on by the course the ships were taking.    Moreover, having the right to defend ones borders and territory doesn't mean that any act can be justified.

&gt;The debate of the legality of israel's occupation has no bearing on this case. The fact is they currently do have gaza under their control, so they can defend it just like their own borders. Because gaza is their border for now.

Israel has an obligation to protect territories it occupies so they can and should defend those borders.  Of course they also have a duty to ensure that the population in the regions they are responsible to have access to the things they need in terms of food, shelter and medicine...

&gt;You keep citing this legal stuff. Under what jurisdiction? 

International law is a collection of treaties, so on that basis.  Jusrisdiction for the law of the sea tends to be global, some other elements of this may fall into multiple jurisdictions (some countries have laws that are extraterritorial when it comes to war crimes etc..).  Realistically I would assume that the only real method of bringing action here would be for Turkey to do so  at the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, or with the International Criminal court, or for it to be taken up by the Security Council (after all, the blockade is already a breach of security council resolution 1860..).  

&gt;What is the punishment. 

That would be up to the body involved in any action, it could range from written condemnation through trade sanctions all the way to military action or embargo, although the latter is vanishingly unlikely.  It is also possible that certain blocks will take action independently (the EU could for example).

It being illegal with no punishment is the same as it being legal. 

Except that isn't the case here.

The facts are countries can defend their borders and no sane country is going to condem israel here. The US and japan both used the same tactics to protect their own borders. It's definitely legal.

No sane country is going to condemn Israel? Most of them already did,  this is why Israel saw a half the world's nations demand to see their ambassadors this morning and why the NATO ambassadors met (and issued a condemnation), This is why the UN security council met (although the US seems to have managed to water that condemnation down quite a bit).  Israel can and should be able to defend it's borders, when it takes military action against foreign flagged vessels in international waters (without consent of the nation that the vessel is registered in) then that could be seen as anything from an unfriendly act through to an act of piracy or even an act of war.

&gt;You can, but it means nothing.

It means something if enough people think the same thing.

&gt;Sure but who will attack israel? Turkey? Israel wants the neighboring countries to attack it, so it can have justification to finish them off. The only reason israel controls gaza right now is the last war where all the countries around israel ganged up on israel and israel won, taking gaza as a valid legal prize.

Oh I agree that that scenario is unlikely, although the point would be that an international force with backing from the UN (say on the grounds of non compliance with resolutions etc..) would be used on a multilateral basis, not some random attack by a neighbour.

&gt;No it isn't, they have nothing to gain by playing nice. The only way I could ever see them playing nice is if all their neighbor accepted the fact that israel now owns gaza and that palestine no longer exists.

&gt;They are never giving up the land they won and they will happily take more if anyone attacks them.

If that is true then we will probably see this mess continuing and it ruining Israel over time, if Israel continues to make mistakes like this one, or the Lebanon war, or the various other things it has done in the last half century to piss the world off, it will find itself cut off, isolated and ignored.  It will probably even lose US support, at which point it may well face real international pressure and sanctions.  That would not be a good thing for Israel at all.

&gt;But they haven't violated anything. No sane country can argue that land won in war cannot be kept.

Actually that isn't the case.  Since the second world war you can't actually annex land after a war, it isn't lawful (it used to be, the right of conquest has existed for ages, but after the whole Germany, Japan thing it was felt better to put an end to it...) or at least not unilaterally.  So yes, countries do argue that land won in war cannot be kept, in Israel's case there are again, UN resolutions that deal with the issue.

&gt;They are also not a pariah, the US is going to stand with israel no matter what.

Maybe, maybe not.  But then the US may well find itself rather less influential and important on the world stage over the next half century, much like Britains influence and power wained, so Israel will have to not only maintain it's links to the US but also make inroads with whoever (or whatever block) takes that position next...

&gt;In addition even if the US didn't help israel, israel has enough fire power to level all of it's neighbors without having to risk losing.

,1,"&gt; You act as if the United States never generated any good karma.

Oh, the US has done some ""good"" things. Our present empire is a *lot* less harsh and more subtle than, for example, the British style. On occasion, when there was a political need, the US would act in a country's interest -- such as allowing S. Korea or Taiwan to have favorable trade arrangements and encouraging their development for Cold War purposes. But such acts of ""goodwill"" *always* had an upside for the US.

&gt; Perhaps you'd prefer to be speaking German right now?

Let's be serious. The Nazis couldn't manage a landing across the ~25 mile English Channel at the peak of their power. How the hell could they have dreamed of invading the US?!

Once Hitler made the mistake of attacking the USSR he was doomed. The Russians killed *far* more German troops than did the US and British combined. We were kind enough to give the USSR some supplies (especially lots of trucks!) which helped them, but the Red Army was doing the fighting and bleeding while the US/UK stalled invading France for years.

While the US/UK were playing in Italy, we were fighting as few as 4 German divisions and trying to tell Stalin that was the long-promised ""Second Front"". Meanwhile, the Red Army was fighting over 200 German divisions on the Eastern Front. It was the Red Army that broke the back of the Germans and from the Battle of Stalingrad onward everyone knew the Allies were going to win the war.

&gt; A lot of good arguments can and have been made that what the United States has done since WWII has in large part been to attempt to stave off another such event,

Propaganda. The US inflated the USSR into a bogeyman with tales of a massive Soviet invasion of western Europe, but examining Soviet archives after the USSR broke up we've learned that the US tales were a myth and the USSR had no plans to launch such an invasion.

Meanwhile, all through the 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s on through to today, the US continues to expand its empire, commit atrocities and overthrow and invade other countries on the most feeble of pretexts. Anyone with eyes should know who the real imperial aggressor is.

&gt; When your vision comes to full fruition, will China be your beacon of restraint and morality for this world?

The Chinese don't have 700-1000+ military bases outside their own territory like the US does. The Chinese aren't arranging for the overthrow of foreign governments, are they? The Chinese don't seem to have much of a taste for empire at all.

&gt; Or will it crush its enemies, you included...

China seems to not develop ""enemies"", only friends of varying degrees.

You're making the mistake of thinking that everyone in the world thinks in terms of imperial/military-power like we in the US have been taught to think.

&gt;Whereas all released video footage points to the ""peace activists"" assaulting the commandos before the shooting commenced.

The commandos were raiding their ships. That is reason enough to assault them. 

&gt;In the event shots were fired before the boarding, I would almost certainly bet that they were shots fired across the bow of the ship as a warning, and not fired at the ship as is claimed.

Self-serving zionist speculation.

&gt;The blockade is in effect only because Israel is threatened by Hamas,

Israel is the regional power. It is not threatened by Hamas at all. Hamas was in large part created by Israel. The blockade was instituted because Israel wants to slowly starve the Gazans to death. That is why the evacuated all the Jewish settlements there.

&gt;who use their hideouts in Gaza to attack and instill terror in the Israeli people.

The Gazans are defending themselves from Zionist colonialism and subjugation. They have every right to attack the Europeans colonists who drove them out of their homes and have occupied and oppressed them for so long. 

&gt;It is truly heartbreaking that it has gone this far, but Hamas continues to chill out in the territory Israel has cut out for them, and regularly obstructs the distribution of the aid which is sent to help.

Hamas makes up the democratically elected government of Israel. How they distribute aid is an internal matter and none of your concern. 

&gt;And let us not forget the fact that it is because of Hamas that these people are stateless in the first place.

Don't be ridiculous. They are a stateless people because of Zionism. Hamas was only formed in the late 80s in large part by the Mossad to counter Fatah and perpetuate the conflict.

Except for the Great Lakes, there is no lake as large as Wollaston Lake in the entire United States.

&gt; The Gazans are defending themselves from Zionist colonialism and subjugation. They have every right to attack the Europeans colonists who drove them out of their homes and have occupied and oppressed them for so long.

I'm not going to debate Israel's policy, because I think you're right, and that they have mistreated the Gazans and West Bankers. This ties in with Israel's right to exist, which has no point in this discussion, because they clearly *do*, and unless something catastrophic happens, it will remain that way.

&gt; Hamas makes up the democratically elected government of Israel. How they distribute aid is an internal matter and none of your concern.

Their social wing may be democratically elected, but they are still a terrorist organization whose only mission is the overthrow and destruction of a sovereign government. As shown with their seizure and hoarding of humanitarian supplies, they have little concern for the population of Gaza.

&gt; Don't be ridiculous.

I reserve the right to be as ridiculous as I wish. Perhaps I was mistaken on that point, but it is only because that is how I have viewed the issue. 

&gt; They were democratically elected you moron.

Again with the insults. Not necessary. Their social wing was indeed elected, but their inability to work with Fatah led to the Palestinian Civil War in 2006-2007, in which Fatah were forcefully expelled from the Gaza Strip.

Hitler surrounded himself with a lot of like minded people. Some of them (Goebbels and Himmler come to mind) were probably just as whacked out as he was. Anti-semitism wasn't created by Hitler. It had been around for 100's of years and was rampant even among your basic law-abiding citizens of Europe at the time. He used it as a way to seize power and to create a common enemy. ""The Final Solution"" was actually though up by his 2nd in command Himmler. Who knows what would have happened if someone would have assassinated Hitler when he started invading his neighbours in 1936.  Maybe the Nazi party would have carried on pretty much the same but with a different leader. Maybe whoever was in charge would not have been as aggressive. We'll never know.

On the other hand, Saddam Hussein was a dictator who had an iron grip on his country. One thing he managed to do was to keep the fighting between the 2 main groups the Shia and the Sunni's under control. When the American's took him out it allowed all these people who hated each other to now be able to fight each other and the American's. Getting rid of Hussein probably created a bigger problem. 

As for genocide's. These go on all the time in Africa. (Currently there's one going on in the Congo.)

,1,"But you've just made a fatal error in your argument.  A longer shelf life and resistance of spoilage ARE a component of nutritive value as well as conducive to bringing lower prices to consumers.  Think of it this way.  You have a fruit that you want to get to a market.  But there was a problem, the fruit was destined to go from Georgia to Chicago, it has to be picked at a certain time, delivered by a certain time, and sold by a certain time or else all that nutrition is useless because it over ripens or rots.

So what can you do?  You knock out an ethylene synthase gene in the fruit so it can't synthesize a compound that promotes ripening (and eventually, rotting).  Now you can sell that fruit any time you want to, just spray some ethylene gas (very cheap) on the knockout fruit and they ripen up for the consumer without going to waste.

How is this method NOT going to deliver more fresh fruits and vegetables to consumers?   I'll tell you why.  A willfully ignorant, uneducated constituency of Americans (and Europeans to an even greater extent) who know nothing about the necessary agricultural means to sustain a planet of 7 billion humans are immediately turned off by the idea of engineering said fruits because one would be ""toying with God""  ""Offending mother nature"" or whatever other ridiculous arguments they fabricate, I don't know, I usually tune out the crazies.  Are there legitimate concerns over contamination of the natural environment?  Of course there are, but guess what, you can even put a killswitch into the engineered crops so they CAN'T escape, mingle, or survive with the wild types.  Just put a flaw somewhere in the organism and watch it die swiftly after escaping its designated grow area.

The long short of it is, twinkies last fairly long on the shelf because no dairy products are used in their production.  Why are they cheaper?  Probably because of massive subsidies on one or more of the ingredients used to produce them.  Should agricultural subsidies exist for obsolete products (HFCS and corn in general, these are the big perpetrators in the public's eye)?  My answer is no.

I was 6, and my dad was taking a trip to Eastern Europe. So Dally came to live with my mom and I for the 5 weeks my dad would be gone.
To clarify: My parents were divorced, originally Dally lived with my dad, he then stayed with my mom, after a few years back to dads, and eventually he just went wherever I went, b/c he loved car rides. 

This was Dally's first time at my mom's and we owned a dog. Part Samoyed/Part Husky. 

Dally had never seen nor heard a dog before. We walked in, let him out of his carrier and my brother (who didn't realize we were keeping my dog in a separate room for a reason) let Yecal(my dog) out and he went bounding for Dally. Yecal was friendly and super playful, and we had another cat at my mom's so he was used to cats. Unbeknownst to Dally that Yecal was wanting to play, he doubled back, kicked the bottom left window out, and dove through it. 

He then hid under the porch, where none of us could reach him.

After about 2 hours, he came out, and he had a GIANT gash on his forehead. I tried to keep him in my arms, but I was 6 at the time, and at this point my mom was inside. He jumped out of my arms and ran again. 

I ran in to tell my mom that Dally was hurt. The whole family scoured our neighborhood to look for him. After a few hours it was night, and sadly we couldn't continue. The next morning I woke up, and he was laying on the porch, gash on head, but calmly waiting for me to take him inside.

I did, and we rushed him to the vet. He was given antibiotics and stitched up, and spent the next few weeks looking as though he was an extreme shakespeare enthusiast.

,1,"We're speaking in broad, sweeping generalities—which are always subject to criticism—but, stereotypically, every ethnic group has its particular ""look"". We all know that Spain, for instance, has a 20% blond rate. But, internationally, when people think of the prototypical ""Spaniard"" they think of someone like Antonio Banderas. Likewise, with Englishmen. We know that there are a variety of different English ""types,"" but—in the popular imagination—images of John Cleese rise up in people's thoughts. 

Likewise—while Jews have a number of different genres—the popular image of a Jewish person (especially in the 18th and 19th centuries) was someone who looked like, say, Barbra Streisand and Amy Winehouse. People with a distinctly Middle Eastern appearance, owing to their origins in Palestine. 

True, within the last fifty years, Jews have [finally] been marrying outside their ethnic group, and are now (at last) experiencing assimilation. For instance, Alicia Silverstone is half-Scottish, and greatly resembles her non-Jewish parent. Or Paul Newman, who's father was German-Jewish and whose mother was a Hungarian Gentile (and, in looks, he resembled his mother).

So you get people—nervous, in a post-Nazi world—rushing to point to people who are half-Jewish and saying, ""But see? Jews can look like anything!""

That's true in the modern age. But not so true before intermarriage became commonplace. Pure Jews—especially the kind born 100 years ago in, say, Poland or Russia—had a distinctive look that owed a lot to their Middle Eastern origins. And they weren't unattractive. They were a very handsome people. It's just that, living in European countries that they weren't native to, they stood out—as a Sicilian might, who lived in Sweden. Or a Greek who moved to Norway.

Take, for instance, this picture of Jeff Goldblum standing between Ed Begley, Jr. and Jon Voigt. http://cache2.asset-cache.net/xc/81535998.jpg?v=1&amp;c=IWSAsset&amp;k=2&amp;d=77BFBA49EF8789215ABF3343C02EA548AD2C67A482A1BF4FAADF484C006EF6E1CE47900FE223DEB7E30A760B0D811297

The handsome Goldblum (while arguably better-looking than his Gentile fellow actors) stands out like a sore thumb between them. With his dark olive complexion and black hair, he has a very Middle Eastern appearance that sets him apart from his Northern European colleagues. Thus Goldblum's ancestors stood out like sore thumbs in Russia, among Slavs.

That's why there was a disgusting ethnic component to bigotry against them. They typically *looked* different from surrounding host populations. The stereotypes of the prominent nose or the dark complexion weren't born in a void. Someone of Middle Eastern ancestry isn't going to look like an Irishman.

And that holds true not just for Jews but for all Middle Easterners across the board, like Lebanese-American Danny Thomas (who always made fun of his big nose). Or Armenian actor Mike Connors, who spoke about his Armenian ancestry and said, ""Most Armenians don't typically look all-American, I know that.""

So it's not beating up on Jews, or trying to single them out. It's just that, when you have a separate community and that community doesn't generally marry outside their ethnic group [like Gypsies in Europe] they maintain certain ethnological traits, even after centuries have passed.

Which is why Amy Winehouse was born in England, but could easily have stepped off a street in Syria. Or why Sasha Baron-Cohen was born in London but could easily pass for an Iranian.

There should be no shame attached to having Middle Eastern ancestry. It's cool. (Most women would keep an Israeli like Oded Fehr over a Western-European like Dudley Moore in a heartbeat. Or Jeff Goldblum over Ed Begley, Jr.) But the fact remains: If you went to a Jewish shtetl in the years running up to World War II, you wouldn't mistake the residents of that village for Irishmen or Norwegians. 

And that's what screen icon Tony Curtis was complaining about: Jewish film moguls in the old studio system discriminating against actors who looked ""too Jewish"" and playing up Jewish actors who didn't look overtly ""ethnic"". It's depressing but as recently as the 1990s David Schwimmer—of ""Friends"" fame—had trouble getting cast because casting directors worried that the olive-skinned, dark-haired actor was ""too ethnic"". After the explosion of the popularity of the hit TV show, all these bigots were proven wrong. But it's instructive to realize that people like Schwimmer, as late as the 1990s, were still encountering bigotry (even from Jewish casting directors). *Especially* from Jewish casting directors.",reddit.com,0,0,True,1,1426328049,False,Drooperdoo,,c0r88c0,True,0,t5_6,1275449484,,t1_c0r88c0,t1_c0r812a,t3_cad22

I think you misunderstood my question.  Another way of phrasing what I meant by ""Toward what end?"" would be ""For what purpose?""  I.e., I'm asking ""What is your motivation for trying to arrange the conditions of economic markets?""

Some example answers might be something like:

- ""I want to ensure social justice for the proletariat, eliminating bourgeois dominance of society.""
- ""I want to maximize the economic production in our economic markets to support greater rates of technological advancement as a way to improve the human condition and ultimately solve the problems of disease, environment, and overcrowding.""
- ""I want to increase individual liberty, reduce the governmental sanction for massive industry-dominating public corporations, and encourage market equilibrium so that the damaging effects of the out-of-control, artificially magnified boom-and-bust cycle will be minimized.""
- ""I want to strengthen US domestic resources so that everybody can be provided for, and ensure that the haves pay their share to help the have-nots.""

I'm sure you can come up with something suitably representative of your own ideas on the subject, if none of those examples really call out to you.  Hopefully this helps clarify the kind of question I meant to ask.

&gt; You're clearly an American. I don't mean that as an insult, but outside of the US, most other developed countries still have functional governments.

""Functional"" is not the same as ""serving its proper function"".  While I was born in the US, and currently live in the US, I have also lived elsewhere (particularly Europe), and traveled around a bit.  What I have seen is that every government is at least as screwed up as that of the US, but they're all screwed up in different ways.  The majority ""native"" population of each place tends to agree that their government is the best of a bad lot, from what I've seen.

&gt; So we can let government hold the reins, as they (broadly speaking) do as we tell them.

Generally, government does as its strongest members tell us to tell them, from what I've seen.

&gt; In the US, well.. Honestly, I don't know. You guys are totally screwed, and I say that with sympathy because I know it's not the fault of reasonable people (like yourself), and because it's not just people in the US who will feel the effects.

I do kinda feel like we're increasingly screwed, all the time.  Each president has been worse than the last, for at least a quarter century.  Congress hasn't really been any better.  Whenever there have been legislative gains, they've been ""balanced"" by at least twice as much loss.  That's not even counting the damage caused by US foreign policy which, as you say, affects more than just people in the US.

Also . . . thanks for calling me ""reasonable"".  I do try.

&gt; There is no structure in place that can replace government, so the obligation is to improve it as much as possible.

Well, yeah, just making government vanish tomorrow would probably cause widespread destruction, potentially resulting in the US turning into a high-tech version of Mogadishu.  I'm no anarchist, at least in practice.  What I'd like to do is, of course, to improve what we have.  I just despair of that ever working out.

&gt; That includes capitalism (which libertarians believe in), because that couldn't ever work as a substitute.

Unless you're an anarcho-capitalist, ""capitalism"" isn't a replacement for government -- it's just a term denoting the circumstance of a market economy whose managing medium is capital.  Unlike the case with Marxist socialism, capitalism itself is not a political system as well as an economic system.  It's *just* an economic system.  When you politicize it, it becomes something like corporatism, or anarcho-capitalism, or fascism, or . . . whatever.

&gt; In short - the US needs a dose of what you call ""socialism"" really, really badly.

Bullshit.  What it *really* needs is transparency and accountability in government.  That's not even *close* to the same thing as socialism.

I love Turkey, in fact if it wasn't for Turkey - I'd never be able to get up and goto work (I start every day with a Turkish coffee). 

&gt;linking the Greek financial crisis to Turkish presence

Greece knew what it was doing when it spent all that money it didn't have. 
I don't blame Turkey one bit. Greece has an oversized military and Greece has its own fear to thank for that. 

&gt;What if instead building a maritime (Aegean, Mediterranean and even Black Sea) trade and defense alliance between Greece, Turkey and Cyprus?

I think Cyprus is another matter that should not be lumped in with Greek/Turkish relations, that way a set-back in one area will not sabotage advances in other areas. 
Cyprus will take a long time to resolve, and Turkey and Greece should not be free to use Cyprus as an excuse for stalling peace and integration (both social and economic). 

As to the maritime borders. I think Turkey and Greece need to sit-down and sign an agreement along the lines of:
*Islands x miles from the Turkish mainland have nautical boundaries of y miles on the side facing Turkey, whereas on the sides facing Greece they have the 16 miles permissible by international law. In the interest of friendship, non-military Turkish vessels will be allowed to sail as close as 6-10 nautical miles (depending on the size of vessel) to the Islands in order to navigate with less hassle through the Aegean.*  


And back on topic. I admire that Turkey are standing up to Israel when the most Europe has to say is 'we want to investigate what happened in Israel'.

,9,"Here is a tl;dr (quotes from the source) - 

&gt;* It's because of a little thing called the “Melancortin 1 Receptor” or MC1R for short. - Everyone has Melancortin 1 Receptors, but in redheads this is mutated.

&gt;* This mutation in the MC1R also causes them to have light skin from having less eumelanin pigmentation and more phaeomelanin pigmentation.

&gt;* This is a genetic advantage for people living in parts of the world where there is little sunlight. - Having lighter skin lets more sunlight through, which stimulates the production of Vitamin D, which in turn is useful for preventing things like rickets.

&gt;* Having skin that won’t tan has decided disadvantages when the sun is out. [Susceptibility to sunlight] lead to much higher rates of skin cancer and birth defects due to the sun destroying the levels of folic acid in their skin.

&gt;* Most redheads carry two mutated MC1R genes, one from their father and one from their mother. - In the case where someone only carries one copy of the mutated MC1R, they tend to end up having brown hair with light skin.

&gt;* This mutated MC1R gene also happens to be recessive. - You can carry one of the genes, but be a more natural blond or brunette.

&gt;* People who carry only one copy are known as “carriers”. - This is why a redhead can be born from two parents that aren’t redheads themselves. - Both parents have a functioning MC1R gene and a mutated version. -  In this case, there is roughly a 25% chance that a child born from these two will be a redhead.

&gt;* If one parent caries two copies of the mutated MC1R and another [has] one normal and one mutated, then there would be about a 50% chance that their child would be a redhead.

&gt;* Contrary to popular belief, redheads weren’t just located in Northern Europe throughout history. - There were pockets of peoples all over the world that had red hair. - From Russia to China to certain groups of Jews and many others; there are even references to indicate there were indigenous peoples of Africa with bright red hair.

&gt;* Scotland has the highest proportional population of redheads at about 13%. - The most redheads in any nation is the United States with about 15 million.

&gt;* [If the world used to have pockets of redheaded people all over the place, but not so much now, what happened?] - People are much more mobile than we were before. - Because of this and the fact that the redhead gene is recessive, even though the mutated gene itself is still being passed along, getting the two mutated copies necessary to produce a redheaded child is becoming much less likely.

&gt;* Before this increased mobility, groups that had this gene mutation tended to stay in one spot; so inevitably pockets of redheads would pop up making it more likely that they’d in turn mate with other redheads as nobody moved around, thus perpetuating [their set of redhead genes].

&gt;* According to a 2007 study done by the Oxford Hair Foundation and funded by the hair dye maker Procter and Gamble who was trying to boost the sale of red hair dye, redheads will very soon become extinct. - This however has since been proved completely false:

&gt;* The mutated gene itself is still being passed on, even when a redhead is not produced (often producing brown haired women who insist on telling everyone they are redheads). - So, while the numbers may continue to diminish by diffusification, the potential for a “redheaded step child” will remain for the foreseeable future.

,1,"&gt; Since it's a social construct, if human society believes it's true, then it is true. That's by far the most important factor.

That's interesting. Are you willing to apply that to [UN resolutions concerning the Palestinian question and Israel's conduct](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_Nations_resolutions_concerning_Israel)? That's a pretty good sample of what human society thinks.

But, I wouldn't ask you to do that. UN resolutions and many of Israel's critics countries have lousy human rights records themselves and spin the Palestinian question for their own political ends. So can we agree that truth isn't a matter of majority rule?

Anyway, my question was not about whether a generic Arab person had more right to Israel than a generic Jewish person; it was comparing someone whose ancestors had been in diaspora for millenia, versus someone who had recognized property rights and continuous habitation. There are plenty of people in the Palestinian enclaves who are still carrying around deeds to buildings now occupied by Jewish settlers.

The matter of interbreeding with Europeans may not be the most important thing, but it just makes the question a bit silly at least in my mind. I knew a Russian Jewish woman with strikingly blue eyes and practically albino-white skin. She insisted that absolutely none of her ancestors had ever intermarried with Caucasians, and that if she looked like other Russians, it was because Russian-ness had sort of seeped into them from the countryside itself. Lysenkoism for the 21st century.

I don't make any judgment on whether Jewish people deserve or should have a homeland or whether that should be in the lands mentioned in the Torah. That's up to them. 

I just don't think what we have was done very well. There were plenty of legal ways for Jews to conduct a mass emigration to Israel, or to compensate people for their land fairly. I regard the 1948 declaration as deeply wrong because it gave citizenship rights to people who had relatively little connection with the country, apart from mere mythology, and diminished the rights of people who had a very strong REAL connection with the country.

The addition of ""fucking"" to any insult can net an extra .001, it's pretty easy to do, so not many Insult-based firms (IBF) will pay more for it. The fact that people spewing insults for such low amounts of pay explains why the volume of insults is so high; there would be less insults if firms payed more, but their models are based on the wide scope of the internet, and always pay on volume. 

Insults based on the phrase ""They're not the _____ _____ in the ______"" pay the largest amount, usually around .02 cents per phrasing, but these are getting rarer in the internet age. 

It should be noted, that IBFs also bundle these insults as insult-based securities (IBS), which have come under-fire recently as many are backed not by insults, but by *mockery"", which is a whole industry aside from IBFs. Mockery-based firms (MBF) pay an even smaller amount, as nearly anyone can be made a mockery of. Most MBFs expect the consistent flow of mockery to back up the validity of said mocking, but not all come to fruition, which incidentally lead to the recent IBS crash. Thousands of assholes lost their jobs. Many want to work, but the pay simply isn't there.

Although the urge to insult is popular, the IBFs currently operating don't usually hire (see ""*out-sulting*""), and many end up insulting without any *real* payoff; while insulting is popular, the current situation in Europe is trending toward snide-commenting, which in itself isn't currently paying, but many Contemtologists believe this to be the future of internet hate. 

The nice thing about insults is that many will grow in value over time; many hold on to that one perfect insult just for the right time, and end up with a decent pay off; One Elizabethan insult payed roughly $100,000 when used in a Utah paintball forum; it certainly ""pays to save"".

,1,"&gt; That's interesting. Are you willing to apply that to UN resolutions concerning the Palestinian question and Israel's conduct? 

No, because I don't accept that the UN is representative of humanity. Even if it wasn't a dictators' club, it's still a result of cynical political maneuverings that 99.99% of humanity doesn't control or even aware of.

It was never *supposed* to represent humanity. It was supposed to represent those in power, mostly to prevent WW3. *Big* difference.

&gt; So can we agree that truth isn't a matter of majority rule?

It is if the question is ""what is your favorite color?"".

The question ""what is a nation"", just like ""what is art"", ""what is justice"" is determined by society. Obviously, you don't have a consensus on every issue, but if everybody agrees that, say, ""the Mona Lisa"" is art, and paying for for your crimes is justice, then it's true, simply because *society* and not anyone else, gets to determine if it's true.

In other words, people agreed that the Jews are a nation long ago before the modern anthropological definitions of a ""nations"" existed. If they happened not to include the Jews, they would be *wrong*. Luckily, as I showed before, this is not the case. The Jews are a nation according to these criteria as well.

&gt; Anyway, my question was not about whether a generic Arab person had more right to Israel than a generic Jewish person;

You misunderstood me. I *was* talking about the Palestinians. The Palestinian Arabs themselves are as genetically diverse as the Jews. Some of them are descended from the crusaders, some from the African slaves, and others, from the various other nations that lived here - Turks, Romans, Hittites, whatever.

If we weren't talking about the Israeli/Arab conflict, I would've referred to the Arab nation, because it's another shining example of a nation that isn't defined by genetics. The fact that we are is just an ironic coincidence.

&gt; The matter of interbreeding with Europeans may not be the most important thing

As I showed right now, it's not an issue at all. Being a nation is about culture, not racial purity.

&gt; I don't make any judgment on whether Jewish people deserve or should have a homeland or whether that should be in the lands mentioned in the Torah.

Correction: the Torah doesn't come with a map. We know what those lands are according to tradition, and *copious archeological data*.

&gt; I regard the 1948 declaration as deeply wrong because it gave citizenship rights to people who had relatively little connection with the country, apart from mere mythology

If you mean the Declaration of Independence, it's not a legally binding document (Supreme Court of Justice decision 10/48). If you mean the partition plan, it doesn't mention who can legally immigrate to Israel. You must be talking about the 1950 Law of Return, and I don't see any problem with it. If you accept the Jews' right to that land (and the state of Israel obviously does), then you accept that every Jew has that right.

And, I said it before, and I'll repeat it once more - the Jews' connection to the land is not ""mythological"". Jewish presence in ancient Israel is well supported by documents and archeology. Their link to Israel was recognized by every nation including themselves throughout history. 

On the other hand, there is *no* genetic or genealogical proof that the actual people currently living in Palestine lived there for longer than 5 generations ago. In fact, it makes no sense that they did. Palestine is a tiny, barren piece of land that wasn't even a discreet entity. People could move in and out of Palestine and *not even notice it*.

There is, of course, undeniable proof that the *Arab nation* lived in that area. But that abstract concept leads us into the same vague territory of the ""Jewish nation""'s claim to the land.",IAmA,0,0,True,1,1426328167,False,nidarus,,c0r8hfv,True,0,t5_2qzb6,1275457982,,t1_c0r8hfv,t1_c0r8e1e,t3_ca3az
,1,"The cold war didn't hasten its end, it seems that peaceful relations during the 80's with Reagan did. Slight democratic reforms completely collapsed the Soviet Empire. Isn't that ironic?  

When it comes to bleeding the Soviets dry, what are you talking about specifically. From my point of view, the cold war did not cost that much blood for the Soviets until the 80s. They didn't really lose that much blood post may 1945.  Campaigns invading Manchura, and Japanese islands went pretty smoothly.

I don't think 455,000 casualties + fatalites (12,000 fatalities) during the 80's in Afghanistan would collapse the USSR.  Yeah, luckily they got out after 10 years.  

The truth is the collapse of the Soviets ended up being worse for everybody, including America.  Besides the millions of Russians who died during the anarchy, the wars with Chechnya, capitalism in Russia has caused a fuck ton of weapons to go from Russia to literally everywhere in the world, making conflicts that much more lethal (that's why it was bad for America.)

,2,"If youre from Europe, you probably will know how the 5% threshold (at least here in Germany) was designed to keep out parties smaller than 5%. So if you somehow manage to get past 5%, you're in. But even with the 5% threshold, people consider voting for smaller parties ""throwing away"" their votes.

You can think of the british and US system as a even higher threshold, designed to basically keep out every party thats not able to immediately _win_ the election. Why this is so, i can only speculate. This probably comes from a time where not individual people's votes mattered, but collective votes of single electoral districts, probably in order to simplify counting.
You didnt say ""the percentages of district X are...."" but ""district X voted for Obama"". So in the end only the _one_ winner was counted in each district.

So like people here mostly ignore sub-5%s for being sub-5%s, in UK/US people ignore probable non-winners for the sole reason of not having the immediate chance to win. So instead of voting for a smaller party which represents their views best, people vote for bigger parties, which maybe do not represent their views optimally, but have a chance to win. 

Theoretically, you could have 5 20%-parties with equal chances to win every time, or 10 10%-parties, but the moment one of them grows significantly bigger than the others, it makes all of the other much less likely to ""win"", so in order to prevent the biggest one from winning every time, you have to go for the second biggest, and so on.

,1,"&gt; Yes you do. You said that Israel is the causation of it's own problems. That's like saying kid who is bullied by everyone else is the cause of his own problems for being who he is. If that's not what you meant, then clarify because the death of the Jewish race has been the goal of many organizations in this century and you applaud that as if it's some noble cause.

Israel *is* a bully. When Israel or it's supporters play the wambulance/victimized card, I call bullshit. Israel does far too many disgusting, sick actions for me to feel sorry for their crappy little pity-state. That said, I don't think jews should have been given somebody elses land as a pity gesture. They should have stayed in Europe or at least been given the opportunity to move to America and given stipends and stuff to help rebuild their lives. They should *never* have been allowed to ruin the lives of the Arabs who already made a home around Jerusalem.

&gt; Why does it have to be those two choices? Why can't it be an independent state that has grown tired of diplomatic means of solving this problem and now chooses to use the military because it's the simplest solution, seeing as how these hate organizations won't budge 1 inch to resolve the conflict.

While it's grown tired of diplomacy, it's military doesn't seem to be winning the conflict and will probably breed future terrorists, one bulldozed household at a time.

The problem is that many people have grown up knowing only that Israel hates them for something they haven't done. They see people they know suffer because of Israel. Is it hard to understand why they'd be pissed? Israel's making no effort to welcome in a more peaceful relationship generation by generation, instead it employs racist tactics that entrench the hate.

&gt; Well considering the root of the problem begins with the hatred and pride in the hearts of the Palestinian people, I would say it is pretty difficult to win that type of conflict.

There is hatred and pride on both sides of the conflict. That's part of the larger and more deeply entrenched problem. Both sides fiercely hate the other.

&gt; While they may be 'hyped up', they still have the ability to kill and maim. If one were to live in the places where these rockets land every day, I would bet those living in that area are afraid for their lives all the time. It may be puny to us, but they are right smack-dab in the middle of it.

Yet those same Israelis don't give a second thought to forcing the Palestinians to go through *worse* fear and *worse* maiming and *worse* death, innocent or not, using white phosphorus or not, attacking a UN compound or not... as long as they get their bloodshed, right? That's what it seems to somebody that's outside of the zone. They don't want the world to help, they want to do it themselves so they can murder as many Palestinians as possible to get revenge for their murdered Israelis. Eye for an eye. Whole damn area is already half-blind.

&gt; If so, then that's great! It would neutralize Hamas (without further bloodshed), consequently causing them embarrassment, and probably even humiliating them just enough so that their only choice would have to be attending peace-talks. Me hopes this tech will be deployed soon.

I also hope it'll help. If Hamas no longer has the rockets to scare Israelis with, *maybe* just *maybe* theyll give Palestinians a bit of peace too.

&gt; Like I said, what if Israel were to stop... they would have the moral higher ground but they would be overridden and pushed out of Jerusalem in a heartbeat because the Palestinians want all or none.

I highly doubt this. Israel has an amazing military.

&gt; Until Palestinians accept that they have no right to that land (at least the middle and northern parts of Israel), then nothing will be achieved but their mindset is already made up.

How does anybody have the right to the land. If a person randomly came up to your land and said that they were on it 2000 years ago, would you seriously give it to them? I wouldn't.

&gt; The only feasible way to achieve just a slight victory is to alienate both extremes and have people choose a side. With no clear objective, fighting there is useless. To have an objective, you need to opposing forces. That's just how it works unfortunately.

I don't think innocents are just an unfortunate casualty of war. I mean, look at the *huge* uproar when some innocents were killed in Iraq because they weren't wearing press vests. The U.S. tries a lot harder than Israel to protect the innocents in their fight against terrorism. Can't Israel learn to do the same?

&gt; However, we know who is the initiator. While the Palestinians may not be to blame directly (ancestral hatred and ignorance is the real fault), they continue to fight a conflict that is not theirs, in any sense. So while both should come to an agreement, if the PLO doesn't come to a consensus that they are demanding land that doesn't belong to them, then no real progress will occur.

I disagree with the Palestinians being the initiator. I view the first acts of land-grabbing by jewish settlers to be the first initiation of conflict. Families were thrown out of their homes and their lands were taken from them. I consider that a conflict. However, things are too far in and no generation today is the same generation that thought the settlements were a good idea. Thus, it seems we're stuck with the mix of people and everybody might as damn well get along and start caring for each other.

Aside from a few things like some church placements and stuff like that, I really wish the two groups would be forced to live under a fair government and stop being racist and start caring and all enjoy their religions together. But that's a damn pipe-dream it seems. So I'll wish for the second best thing: to end the violence at least (and maybe someday the racism), even if it means two separate states.

&gt; The Jews have been there since before 1 B.C. Considering the whole Moses-Pharaoh ""power struggle"", that would make it go as far as 3000 B.C. (I think, it may be closer to 4000).

My point is that some stuff happened and the land changed hands. How does one rationalize stealing back 2000+ year old land? That seems like utter madness to me. The only thing I can fathom is that people use religion as an excuse, but since I'm an atheist and firmly support the 
separation of government and religion as much as possible, this explanation would bother me. I could understand jews wanting to tour Israel (just like Muslims tour Mecca), but damn, kicking people off their land for it? Just doesn't make much sense to me. However, as I noted earlier, this is kind of a tangential argument since it's not like I could expect anybody to ""undo"" the land-grab, so Israelis and Palestinians are there to stay.

&gt; (Examples of war against Israel:

About a year ago (maybe more) I spent a good 3 hours reading all the Wikipedia entries about the wars from today as far back as when the jewish settlers first started moving in. It was an excellent read, but something really bothered me. Nobody finds it reasonable that people told to get out and make way for jews might get pissed and retaliate. Why?

&gt; You go back centuries and millennia and the people who live in these lands were primarily of Jewish origin.

I fully accept that people of Jewish origin lived there thousands of years ago. I do not fully accept why that gives their descendants, thousands of years (or hundreds, doesn't matter to me), the right to take back that land. How is this some inherent right?

No other group in the world has been given that right, regardless of atrocities, genocides, governments, etc. Why are jews special? Why aren't they the same and equally as valuable as every other human on this hunk of rock we call Earth?

It's easy to talk about what ""would"" happen.  No-one can contradict what happens in a make-believe world.  But you could look at what has happened.

They didn't drop cluster bombs on Monaghan.  They didn't drop White Phosphorous on the Divis Flats...

Interesting.  Does this reasoning apply to the ancient land claims of every ethic group in the world?  Would it apply to the Canaanites as well?

Every single scrap of land on Earth has a bloody history.  Every acre has been fought over and bears the burden of ancient injustice.  Why visit a fresh injustice upon an innocent people, as the Zionists did when they drove people from their homes?

,1,"&gt;My wife's hypothesis (which she may or may not have come up with herself, but she's the first one I heard say it) is that it's because England has a state religion that religion is so weak there. The Church of England doesn't need to bust its ass to get followers, it's supported by the government and so a lot of people are members just sort of by inertia or default.

&gt;My personal hypothesis is that World War II put Europe on a long slide away from religion. That much death and destruction on such a vast scale over such a wide area basically put the Problem of Evil in too stark a light, and too many people wised up and said, ""You know what, this 'God' stuff is horseshit. No loving god would ever put us through that.""

The way that it worked out was slightly different between majority Catholic/Orthodox countries, where the idea of separating church and state was pursued rather early on (first by the French Revolutionaries and later anti-clerical political groups which raged against the excesses of the state-church ties) and majority Protestant countries (where there wasn't ever as much of a pronounced lay rage against state-church ties, probably because the administration of the churches were more firmly under state control and national identity than the Roman Catholic Church; the rage could always happen later, though).

Either way, I fear that even though the lay population is moving away from churches in general, the population has not shed the bigotry - latent or open - that was instilled into the long-term national discourses of Europe by state-favored Christianity; the fact that Europeans, including the French and the Dutch, are becoming increasingly queasy about North African and South/Southwest Asian immigrants because of their establishment of Muslim theologies and institutions which also enjoyed the support of various states in those origin regions through totalizing symbioses reveals that, as single states, the European experience of soft or hard secularism or agnosticism - in the state or among the population - has not taken into account the presence of larger (10%+) religious minority populations which don't fall into the Christian/post-Christian continuum of Abrahamic religions. 

At the most, European-style secularism or laicity is mostly constructed within the context of countries which have a Christian majority and/or a historically-dominant denomination, and attempts to win over the populations (rather than the states) of Muslim religious communities to a less mosque-centered, more liberal revision of their cultures have not worked so far because of this bias of European secularism and liberalism in the residual favor of Christian cultural impact. Plus, even secular Europeans are often caught up in the tendency to revert to the old religious canards and hatreds of the majority Christian denomination, or at least end up apologizing for the excesses of their fellow citizens. To have atheists and other nontheists caught up in these reversions in Europe, even though the most ardent among them, I'm sure, are intentionally shedding the presence of such tendencies and legacies from their own lives within the limits of being a minority, would be disastrous to the advancement of living one's life without governance by a deity in any part of the world, among anyone bearing any color of skin, any orientation of sexuality or gender, or speaking any language. The presence of Muslims and Jews doesn't have to change the lyrics of popular secularism and atheism in Europe towards fitting around formerly-Christian-supremacist tunes.

&gt;In the U.S., no church is the official favorite, so they all have to compete for followers. Survival of the fittest, so to speak. ;-)

That, and the fact that, [early on, your religious group could retreat into the hinterland of American territorial claims in order to remove yourself from being brutally treated by dominant Protestant sects in states like Missouri, and then manage to become a majority sect in your own private semi-theocracy in which everyone shares the same or similar beliefs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latter_Day_Saint_movement). Or your sect could [come over from South Korea, buy a few media properties and become influential players in the authoritarian far-right of US politics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_Church). Or your sect could [provide free, minimally-inquisitive ordinations over the Internet to purported millions so that they can perform weddings or set up their own sects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Life_Church). Or your sect could [host other sects and ask that all members refrain from endorsing interreligious conflicts for the sake of coexistence under the same roof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarian_Universalism).

That religions are allowed to not only compete or cooperate for members, but to also have their own ""safe spaces"" for observance or hold retreats in the hinterland, is a rather far cry from the dominance of large, historically-state-supported religious creeds in the Western Old World (anywhere west of East and South Asia). There is much more room to move within a freer model of people-religion relations, and it may help the population incrementally move away from the prejudices of past religions.

I think that atheists and nontheists can also use this model to promote a worldview that subtracts the need for a deity AND the psychotic prejudices of proselytizing Abrahamic religions.",atheism,0,0,True,1,1426328276,False,raynevandunem,,c0r8puo,False,0,t5_2qh2p,1275469323,,t1_c0r8puo,t1_c0r8l7e,t3_cahd5

&gt;The word meaning ""bundle of sticks"" is ultimately derived, via Old French and Italian, from Latin fascis (also the origin of the word fascism).[7] The origins of the word as an offensive epithet for homosexuals are, however, rather obscure, although the word has been used in English since the late 16th century to mean ""old or unpleasant woman,"" and the modern use may derive from this.[8] Female terms, it should be noted, are often used with reference to homosexual or effeminate men (cf. nancy, sissy, queen). The application of the term to old women is possibly a shortening of the term ""faggot-gatherer"", applied in the 19th century to people, especially older widows, who made a meagre living by gathering and selling firewood.[9] It may also derive from the sense of ""something awkward to be carried"" (compare the use of the word ""baggage"" as a pejorative term for old people in general).[7]
&gt;It is sometimes claimed that the modern slang meaning developed from the standard meaning of ""faggot"" as ""bundle of sticks for burning,"" presumably with reference to burning at the stake.[7] This is, however, unlikely to be the case,[7] and there is no tradition of burning at the stake being used as a punishment for homosexuality in Britain,[10][11] although supposed witches and heretics were burnt to death in other parts of Europe, and were often accused of deviant sexual behaviour.[12]

* The current regulation does not limit travel of US Citizens to Cuba per se, but it makes it illegal for US Citizens to have transactions (spend money or receive gifts) in Cuba under most circumstances without a US government Office of Foreign Assets Control issued license.[11]

* The Cuban Liberty and Democracy Solidarity Act (known as the Helms-Burton Act) which penalizes foreign companies that do business in Cuba by preventing them from doing business in the US.

* United States nationals can circumvent the ban by traveling to Cuba from a different country (such as Mexico, The Bahamas or Canada), as Cuban immigration authorities do not stamp passports. In doing so, they would risk prosecution by the U.S. government if discovered.

* The Helms-Burton Act has been the target of criticism from Canadian and European governments in particular, who resent the extraterritorial pretensions of a piece of legislation aimed at punishing non-U.S. corporations and non-U.S. investors who have economic interests in Cuba. In the Canadian House of Commons, Helms-Burton was mocked by the introduction of the Godfrey-Milliken Bill, which called for the return of property of United Empire Loyalists seized by the American government as a result of the American Revolution (the bill never became law). Furthermore, the European Parliament in 1996 passed a law making it illegal for EU citizens to obey the Helms-Burton act.

* The United Nations General Assembly  has condemned the embargo as a violation of international law every year since 1992. In 2002, for example, it condemned the embargo by 173 votes to 3.[36]  Israel routinely joins the U.S. in voting against the resolution as has Palau every year since 2004. On October 28, 2009, for the 18th time, the United Nations condemned the embargo.

,8,"No, it's based on actually reading books on physical anthropology by people like Coon and Lundman. The Mediterranean nation with the highest blondism rates would be Spain [with 20% of its population demonstrating blondism]. Blond hair and fair eyes dip off incrementally the further east you move in the Mediterranean, the rates dropping as you hit Italy [12%], move on to Greece [8%], Turkey [4%], etc.

Once you hit Israel, Syria, Lebanon, etc. black hair statistically becomes the norm. While blondism exists—and exists naturally—it's in the single-digits.

I was watching a documentary on Israel recently, and a little kid had dark blond hair and blue eyes. It was a Palestinian kid. You could tell his hair would be brown in adulthood, but there it was: blond in childhood.

So Jews had these traits—recessively—before they ever entered Europe. They exist naturally in all Mediterranean populations, albeit in low numbers.

The larger statistical outlier among Jews is NOT blond hair, but red hair. (That, too, exists naturally in the Middle East. One of Saddam Hussein's generals was a redhead, as was Mohammed, according to the Koran.) Ashkenazic Jews got an even higher red-haired ratio when they bred with European populations [like Khazars and Slavs]. So red hair you see naturally occurring. Blond hair . . . not so much.

The overwhelmingly statistical rule is black hair in the region. Up in the 70-80% ratios. Dark brown hair is next, with about 10-15% having it. Next comes red hair. And, last—as an extremely low percentage—is naturally occurring blonds.

* Footnote: Interestingly, North African Berbers had—according to Carleton Coon's ""The Races of Europe""—the world's fourth- or fifth-highest redhead rate. As recently as Antiquity, they apparently had extraordinarily high rates of blondism, as well. The Egyptians—calling them ""Libyans""—referred to them as ""The White Race"" and depicted Berbers as blond and blue-eyed. They apparently got darker as Arabs conquered the region and started to bring in blacks from beyond the Sahara. But the original stock appears to have been very fair. This was circumstantially confirmed when the Spaniards discovered the Canary Islanders in the 1400s. They were shocked to find islands full of tall blonds. When DNA tests were done on the Canarians [in the modern age], it was confirmed that they were descended from the original Berber stock. Isolated, though, the Canarians didn't get darker as demographics changed in the rest of North Africa. On their islands, they retained their original ethnological character. Further DNA testing showed that Berber mitochondrial DNA was identical to the Saami of Finland and Scandinavia. So the theory is that, during the Ice Age, as European populations headed south into Spain, some traveled a bit further into North Africa. So the ancient Egyptians weren't smoking weed when they portrayed the ""Libyans"" as blond and fair-skinned, referring to them as ""The White Race"".

You still occasionally see the original phenotype, as in this picture of Berbers in the modern age: http://mathildasanthropologyblog.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/berberchildwh1.jpg

Thanks for the links.  They confirm what I suspected.  That israel owns that land and there is zero punishment for these ""illegal"" acts.

&gt;There is no reason to believe that the Arab countries were going to attack or exterminate anybody. From the wikipedia entry on the 67 war:

Ha. Right in your same article.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War#The_drift_to_war
&gt;Speaking to the UN General Assembly in September 1960, Nasser had stated that ""The only solution to Palestine is that matters should return to the condition prevailing before the error was committed - i.e., the annulment of Israel's existence."" In 1964 he said, ""We swear to God that we shall not rest until we restore the Arab nation to Palestine and Palestine to the Arab nation. There is no room for imperialism and there is no room for Britain in our country, just as there is no room for Israel within the Arab nation."" In 1965 he asserted, ""**We shall not enter Palestine with its soil covered in sand, we shall enter it with its soil saturated in blood.**""

Essentially you are saying that if the americans had known about the japanese attack, intercepted it, and blew it up, it would mean america started the war with japan for protecting itself.  That is a very pathetic way of looking at reality.  Israel only one the war because of the preemptive strike to knock out the Egyptian airforce.

&gt;And Israel in its current form does not deserve to exist. Its an apartheid-like European colony on Arab soil that was built on the ethnic cleansing of the native people. It needs to be abolished.

- Belgium had military forces in Rwanda just before the slaughtering started there. The Belgian army forced citizens from Rwanda to carry ID cards. On those ID cards was inscribed to what tribe a person belonged. (Which is a similar idea to the David-star that Nazi's forced Jews to wear)
Needless to say the result was horrible. Due to that inscription on the ID card rebels knew which tribe everyone belonged to, so they started to slaughter all the civilians of the other tribes. Over a million people died horrible deaths, including women, children and babies. The Belgian army left just before the slaughter got heavy.

- Not long after WW2 The Netherlands started a war against Indonesia in order to keep them colonized after 300 years of occupational colonization.

- Recently it has become known that in WW2 Swiss banks (secretly) funded the Nazi regime. 

- Some years ago several European bankers funded 2 tribes in Nigeria to wage war against each other. They gave 1 tribe slightly more money than the other and the best funded tribe won. 5 million civilians died in that war. Those bankers funded that war, because under the ground where those tribes lived there were major deposits of Lithium. Those bankers wanted that Lithium so they could sell it on the world market so that it could be used for mobile phone batteries. The tribe that won was the one that was favorable to sell that lithium to those bankers for a nickel and a dime. Most mobile phones batteries contain exactly that Lithium, because it's the cheapest Lithium on earth.


These things are far less known than many of the great wrongs of the major nations, but even among them there are lesser known atrocities like the ""trail of blood/tears"" where 26 million native Indians were killed by American colonist armies.

In large parts of Europe, most customers are on contracts where they get their phones upgraded after 12-18 months, maybe 24 months at worst... In other words, the manufacturers don't care, because the carriers don't care, because most of the phones from users that care about app availability will get cycled out so quickly anyway.

Anyone opposed to Israel is naturally biased against Israel because of their opposition, just as anyone who favors Israel would be called biased in favor of Israel. Biased was the perfect term to use, because when it comes to people taking sides in this conflict, once they do, it seems almost pathologically impossible for them to ever consider any other perspective rationally ever again. The second paragraph he wrote is one of the most ridiculous things ever written, but that's to be expected of those redducated on the subject.

And I'm not even necessarily in favor of Israel, I'm just not in favor of the circlejerking hivemind indoctrinating another unsuspecting user into their ridiculous self-escalating mountain of mis-informational wanking.

One thing I would suggest you keep in mind as you explore this conflict is that despite what people will say, this is not just about the Palestinians and the Israelis. It's the entire region. You have to be aware of how every side has manipulated each other, their own allies and even themselves for decades in all kinds of ways and how much of a clusterfuck it is. Of what other Arab countries have done to, and used the Palestinians for, to the detriment of the refugee populations and those still in the Gaza/West Bank areas. Of the political factions and movements inside Israel itself. Of the origin of both nationalities and the mentalities of the inhabitants, whose claims on the land trace back thousands of years. Even of Europe's involvement, since the entire conflict is essentially their fault (a bit of my own bias peeking through there, I suppose :P).

This is a long-standing, deeply nuanced conflict that most people on here will not be able to inform you about accurately. You'll need to rely on your own judgment when evaluating sources.

coincidences are usually not coincidences but results of certain acts.. which if not done on purpose would not happen. 

FOLLOW THE MONEY... if you follow the money you will end up at the door steps of the very people who we elect and who are on TV every day claiming they are for freedom and against terrorism.. but really their the ones who are creating the terrorism to be relevant... conflict is profitable.. peace is stagnation.. it takes a village to raise a child.. but it takes one person in a white house to start a war or deny ending one. Too bad we have over a hundred of these war mongers who are playing both sides at the same time... at the expense of the people who believe their lies.

religion is no different than being a sports fan... just because someone is saying something negative about your team doesnt mean you have to say something negative about theirs. You know your team is good... but you feel like the people with a different belief need to know that yours is the right one.. not theirs. right... and religion keeps this system of belief legit.. it keeps it allowed in society.. if you have a group that believes women should wear their underwear on their feet and you throw in 1 person who knows underwear goes under your pants... the one who wears the underwear right is considered the outcast..and thus made to conform to doing the wrong thing. But thats not how the majority sees it. The american way seems just as likely to prosper as religion... why go through the motions if you know the outcome will be bad? Because you can lie and make everyone believe the opposite. That is how the government operates.. and the things that are bad to that one person because hes actually normal are spun to sound like positive things for the majority which is incorrect but believes its doing the right thing.

remember.. the germans believed they were doing the right thing.. and today we call them all nazis. Just like terrorists today are just people who became what they are because of their beliefs. mental disease is not curable.. nor is it easily diagnosable.. who knows how many people out there have mental problems and dont know about them? And how many of that percent are active supporters of the different violent regimes around the world. Then how many under the employment of a countries top strike team are above the law and can get away with murder like on the Flotilla that entered israeli waters illegaly? And then fired upon and boarded? And the USA actually shows someone on TV saying THATS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DO WHAT WE SAY NOT TO... AND IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN... ITS JUSTIFIED...

no sorry.. no violence is justified.. ever.. we should have learned from WW1 and WW2 especially.. that the germans didnt have tanks and weapons and the most dangerous military in the world by themselves. They had help from the USA, from italy, from japan, from the surrounding european countries. But we all know nothing happens without the USA... if germany had the best machinery and technology.. wouldnt the USa be hand and hand with them? All questions which noone wants to think about..

the scarriest thing is the people who were the top of the Third Reich were employed by the US government after WW2 ended.. the scientists.. the murderers... and the doctors who cut up thousands of innocent women and children.. rape and murder for fun is not even discussed because the sick depravity with which people do what ever they want is disgusting... then they turn around and give a speech to the public about abstinence and how evil homosexuality is.. only to have their mind wander to the little 8 year old boy who they will penetrate through the ass later that day. Probably still in the church.. while the parents are confessing. 

Oh and confession is brilliant.. its the single reason why religion is a joke. To commit any act that you have to ""confess"" is to commit a sin.. and sin = hell. Sorry.. only the devil would create a book that makes people believe evil acts can be wiped or excused if you just say them to a church employee.

,1,"&gt;Moreover, having the right to defend ones borders and territory doesn't mean that any act can be justified.

It does mean you can board a ship.  And 30 miles?  That is damn close.  The US controls it's coast lines much further than 30 miles out.  We tax oil rigs over 50 miles out.

30 miles is definitely close enough to board a ship you know is planning to attack you.

I am surprised there is so much hoopla over the ship not being in israeli waters.  30 miles = in israeli waters.  Somalia is trying to claim fishing grounds hundreds of miles off their coast.  Many countries do control water areas hundreds of miles off their coast.

30 miles is definitely close enough to board them, period.

&gt;although the point would be that an international force with backing from the UN (say on the grounds of non compliance with resolutions etc..) would be used on a multilateral basis

Never going to happen.  The US controls the UN and we will never turn on israel.  Israel does more to stop terrorism than any war the US started.

&gt;If that is true then we will probably see this mess continuing and it ruining Israel over time, if Israel continues to make mistakes like this one, or the Lebanon war, or the various other things it has done in the last half century to piss the world off, it will find itself cut off, isolated and ignored

Definitely not.  The US will stick behind them and so will europe(even if europe bitches publicly, they technically will be behind them, just like right now).  Also this was not a mistake.  No sane person is saying israel did not have a right to board that ship. The only ones saying that are the ones that hate israel and consider israel's occupation of gaza illegal, thus they use that as justification that israel has no right to defend those waters.  This is a bullshit argument.  People need to accept the fact that israel does control the area and the waters and taking out a threat 30 miles off shore is perfectly acceptable to every nation with a coast line.

&gt;Israel can and should be able to defend it's borders, when it takes military action against foreign flagged vessels in international waters (without consent of the nation that the vessel is registered in) then that could be seen as anything from an unfriendly act through to an act of piracy or even an act of war.

Then turkey should attack israel.  But when it comes down to it, israel stopped the turkish vessel from violating israeli waters.  The turkish vessel was trying to commit an act of war.  The fact that turkey has not attacked, makes it clear turkey does not want war.  Thus turkey can bitch all they want, but they 100% support israel in this.  Their flagged vessel had to be stopped.  No one can argue against that.

&gt;Since the second world war you can't actually annex land after a war, it isn't lawful 

Again, pointless.  Israel annexed it.  Unless you want to physically take it back, it is their land.  Illegal without a punishment means it is not illegal.

&gt;Well, apart from the fact that if Israel decided to level all it's neighbours Israel as the state it currently is would probably cease to exists shortly afterwards, but yeah.

Who would destroy it?  Again, they would level their neighbors.  Those are the only people willing to attack israel.  No one else would.

,7,"Not everyone in Europe upgrades their phones after 12-18 months, and the cell providers here are now pushing 24 month contracts as the default.

The way the mobile phone market works over here (regulation) ensures that you can see exactly how much the phone is going to cost you. You can get exactly the same contract for less money (and no commitment) if you choose to go to the same teleco without a ""free"" phone. So if I bring my old handset and take a contract for 300 minutes a month it'll cost me £15; if I want my cell provider to give me a Desire that very same contract will cost me £25 a month for 24 months.

Thus having a phone which promises to be updated with the next version of Android in 12 months time does offer value to the consumer. Users may choose to buy such models, if it were offered to them. 

It would be fantastic if phone manufacturers would release updates for 2 years after release, and it really wouldn't be that hard for them to do so for the most popular models (considering how Cyrogenmod &amp;c manages to do so); the thing that prevents them is the huge variety of models that manufacturers release.

Sometimes it isn't about what we can do for ourselves but what we can do for others.  I think the way Bush tried to force democracy down the middle east throat was wrong, but talking to my fellow friends in uniform, we are doing a lot of good for those people while we are there.  

I do agree with you on the shop till you drop mentality - those people are morons.  Consumerism has made them so.  They could stand to pick up some perspective too.  So could our crooked politicians.  In some of the countries where I've been deployed, they'd have taken Bush out into the street and let the populous have at him to solve their grievances.

,24,"Well, no, not really.

The Android vs iPhone = PC vs Mac comparison is flawed in a couple of very basic ways, as is your analysis of the PC vs Mac situation. I've read opinions similar to yours a couple times today and I'll break it down as I see it.

To start with, cellphones are computers, but the cellphone market is nothing like the PC market.
* Most computers are commodity machines sold at extremely low margins and Apple is one of the few companies that markets a premium, value added product. In the cellular market, 99% of phones sold in Europe/the US are brand name phones from major manufacturers, tied to major carriers. Completely different markets.
* Phones need to ""just work"" on a completely different level than computers. Most non-computer oriented people I know have ""a computer guy"", be it someone in their family or a friend. They don't have ""a phone guy"" or if they do, it's someone who recommends a phone for them to buy. They're consumer electronic gadgets, more akin to a TV than to a computer.
* Computers are a lot simpler than most people think, at the end of the day they have: a monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, a sound device and a data store. If a peripheral other than that is supported, it's because the software is targeted at that peripheral (scanner software, digital camera software, etc). A phone has a lot more ways of interacting with us: keypad, keyboard, touch screen (is it resistive? does it have multi-touch?), vibration, status LCD (what colors does it support?), trackball, T9, joystick, side buttons, digital camera, digital compass, accelerometer, GPS, aGPS, etc... And we expect apps to work with whatever we have in our phone, because the included apps have always worked with them. If VLC doesn't support my 12 year old MPEG decoding card, nobody cares, if an app for my phone can't take advantage of it's MPEG decoding hardware, I'm pissed.

Moving on, Macs are an open development platform and have been at least since OS X came out. If anything they're easier for *nix coders to code on (vs Windows) because they are UNIX systems. The tools are just as cheap/free (included with every Apple computer) as any other proprietary operating system. Upgrades are free (within point releases) or cheap ($29 for the last upgrade) for major releases. There is one current consumer version of OS X at any given time, that's it.

Look, I think Apple has taken control of the phone to a point that it kinda sucks, but I understand why they're doing it. They approach the iPhone as an experience they're selling, not just a piece of hardware. They make money off it as long as it's in use, so they're paranoid about 3rd parties fucking up that experience. Android doesn't have that at all, Google doesn't care about the phones, the manufs don't care about the software, nobody seems to care about the apps - I can't find a single report about the Android Marketplace where app sales are anything but a joke.

As for ""losing again"", Apple might not be outselling Dell, Acer or HP in units shipped, but it has a profit margin that makes those companies weep. Dell's profit margin is 2.8%, Apple's is 21% so last year, when Dell outshipped Apple 4:1, it ended up making $8.5 billion less - who exactly is beating who?",programming,0,0,True,24,1426328591,False,jedrekk,,c0r9e6i,False,0,t5_2fwo,1275497114,,t1_c0r9e6i,t1_c0r9954,t3_cal37

Draws interesting links between trade, state granted monopolies, war, police state tactics...

After years of partially successful, mostly rural wool monopolies in England, the worsted wool market took off in NW Europe in the 16th century thanks to some technical innovations.

England's government created a cartel and through all sorts of machinations attempted to keep control and bolster exports by fighting wars, creating professional certification and granting monopolies.

Thanks to the wool trade, London was reborn as a city, this time as a power unto itself (not a Roman client city) thanks to the wool draperies trade (and in essence giving birth to English civilization).

England's grip on the wool trade went back and forth.  Political patronage was an integral part of the wool trade, tied to military and police actions.

Some interesting quotes...

&gt; The ""saltpetre men of the gunpowder contract dug in every man's house"" for the nitrate-laden soil which was their raw material. The minions of the playing-card monopoly invaded shops in search of cards lacking its seal and browbeat their owners, under threat of summons to a distant court, into compounding for their offences. The search-warrant was, indeed, indispensable to the monopolist if he were to eliminate competition and leave himself free to fix the price of his wares.

,1,"&gt;It does mean you can board a ship. And 30 miles? That is damn close. The US controls it's coast lines much further than 30 miles out. We tax oil rigs over 50 miles out.

30 Miles outside of it's territorial waters, so 30 miles plus the bit of ocean that, under international agreements it controls, we are talking about a ship that (based on BBC maps at least) was over 100km off shore. 

&gt;30 miles is definitely close enough to board a ship you know is planning to attack you.

The ship was an aid ship, or, if you don't like the definition, it was a cruise liner, not a missile ship or an aircraft carrier.  It was intending to breach an unlawful blockade and deliver goods to Gaza, not land frigging marines.

&gt;I am surprised there is so much hoopla over the ship not being in israeli waters. 30 miles = in israeli waters. Somalia is trying to claim fishing grounds hundreds of miles off their coast. Many countries do control water areas hundreds of miles off their coast.

&gt;30 miles is definitely close enough to board them, period.

As I said, 30 miles outside of Israeli territorial waters, much further from the coast.

&gt;Never going to happen. The US controls the UN and we will never turn on israel. Israel does more to stop terrorism than any war the US started.

Well that is the sticking point isn't it.  The US probably won't turn on Israel, unless of course the TV is constantly filled with Israeli military types killing civilians, or reports of Israelis killing Americans, or indeed pictures of dying kids in rubble...  So the issue there is one of who controls the US media, something that again, may well change and something that in the internet age may well change anyway. I wouldn't bet on US support being permanent, I also wouldn't bet on US power being permanent.

As to Israel stopping more terrorism, that is probably actually true, although it would also be true to say that Israel has been directly responsible for more terrorism than the US has dealt with and indeed is probably the root cause and motivator for much of the terrorism that we do see.

&gt;Definitely not. The US will stick behind them and so will europe(even if europe bitches publicly, they technically will be behind them, just like right now). Also this was not a mistake.

As I said, that may or may not remain the case.

&gt;Also this was not a mistake. No sane person is saying israel did not have a right to board that ship. The only ones saying that are the ones that hate israel and consider israel's occupation of gaza illegal, thus they use that as justification that israel has no right to defend those waters.

The legality is questionable, however rather a lot of people are saying that the manner in which Israel acted was not justifiable.

&gt;People need to accept the fact that israel does control the area and the waters and taking out a threat 30 miles off shore is perfectly acceptable to every nation with a coast line.

And again, the 'threat' was 30 miles outside of Israeli territorial waters and was a frigging cruise liner.

&gt;Then turkey should attack israel. But when it comes down to it, israel stopped the turkish vessel from violating israeli waters. The turkish vessel was trying to commit an act of war.

No, Israel violated a Turkish flagged vessel in international waters.  That is something that Turkey is probably taking up with Israel right now.

&gt;Thus turkey can bitch all they want, but they 100% support israel in this. 

Well, they don't.  Their domestic opposition won't let them let this lie, but whatever happens it will be short of war.

&gt;Their flagged vessel had to be stopped. No one can argue against that.

You keep saying that no one can argue against this or that, people can and do. Israel is so clearly in the wrong here that it isn't even funny.  Even if everything were perfectly legal (which it probably isn't), and even if no one can touch Israel (because it is supported by a superpower) it is still in the wrong.  

&gt;Again, pointless. Israel annexed it. Unless you want to physically take it back, it is their land. Illegal without a punishment means it is not illegal.

No, illegal means illegal, punishment may well come if what is set out in resolutions is not honoured.  Israel may well be getting away with it, but it is breaking international law, it is ethically and morally wrong and that needs to change.

&gt;Who would destroy it? Again, they would level their neighbors. Those are the only people willing to attack israel. No one else would. It would risk bringing the US into it, and no one wants to fight the US.

I think if Israel levelled it's neighbours even the US wouldn't support it any more, it would be more of a problem than it would be a benefit.

30 miles is pretty reserved.  I would say at least 50 miles would be the standard.  At least for the US, china, japan, russia, england, etc.

200 miles is the economic zone limit.  Israel was well within that.

And to top it off arguing that israel has no right to intercept smugglers is a joke.  No country is going to say israel does not have the right to do this.  Because all countries historically have patrolled much father out than 30 miles.

&gt;No, Israel violated a Turkish flagged vessel in international waters. That is something that Turkey is probably taking up with Israel right now.

I laugh at that comment. The ship admits it was going to violate israeli waters and was smuggling.  They are openly admitting this.  If turkey stands behind this ship, I will be surprised.  I have a feeling they will bitch publicly, but do nothing else.

If Turkey really want to back these smuggling vessels, israel can legally accept that as a declaration of war and a first strike.  No way turkey is going to do that.

Even if everything were perfectly legal (which it probably isn't), and even if no one can touch Israel (because it is supported by a superpower) it is still in the wrong.

How is it wrong?  Israel won the land in war.  I accept a countries right to take land when it is the victim of aggressors.  France could have taken a piece of germany as a buffer if they wanted.  The reason why europe went back to the way it was, is because the US was willing to back a return to normalcy and occupy germany to make sure that happened.  If France stood alone like israel against people not willing to give up their military forces to prove they will not attack again, then israel could give the land back.  The dearming of germany is the reason, germans were able to keep their boarders.

Right now israel is still attacked by suicide bombers and terrorists from neighboring countries.  These countries haven't given up or at least diminished their military in any way.  They keep their military at a size big enough to invade israel again.  On top of that they do nothing to police the terrorists in their countries.  Their lack of policing = support of these actions.

,0,"&gt;A declaration that you want everyone in an entire country to die is rhetoric? Seriously? By the leader of another country?

Yes, its political rhetoric between countries that are not on good terms. And where does he say he wants everyone in a country to die? Stop making stuff up.

&gt;That is a declaration of war.

No, it isn't. Countries that are not on good terms commonly exchange such bombastic threats.

&gt;Israel would have been stupid to wait for these nuts to build up their armies and attack first.

Israel doesn't deserve to exist in the first place. Its a European colony on Arab soil and the Arab response is completely understandable. They're not nuts at all. And there is no evidence that the Arabs were building up their armies to attack first. You've just made that up.

&gt;Israel would have lost had they not preemptively destroyed egypts airforce.

Lost what? Israel launched the war, remember?

&gt;It would be like the US preemptively bombing japanese air strips because they intercepted proof that japan was going to bomb pearl habor. Japan is still the aggressor who shot first.

Except there is no good evidence that Egypt was going to attack Israel. None at all. I'll paste the paragraph again:

&gt;Yitzhak Rabin, who served as the Chief of the General Staff for Israel during the war stated: ""I do not believe that Nasser wanted war. The two divisions he sent into Sinai on May 14 would not have been enough to unleash an offensive against Israel. He knew it and we knew it."" Menachem Begin stated that ""The Egyptian army concentrations in the Sinai approaches did not prove that Nasser was really about to attack us. We must be honest with ourselves. We decided to attack him."" [76] Former Chief of Staff of the armed forces, Haim Bar-Lev (a deputy chief during the war) had stated: ""the entrance of the Egyptians into Sinai was not a casus belli,"" but argued instead that the Egyptian blockade of the Straits of Tiran ultimately caused the war. Major General Mattityahu Peled, the Chief of Logistics for the Armed Forces during the war, said the survival argument was ""a bluff which was born and developed only after the war... ...""When we spoke of the war in the General Staff, we talked of the political ramifications if we didn't go to war —what would happen to Israel in the next 25 years. Never of survival today."" [77] Peled also stated that ""To pretend that the Egyptian forces massed on our frontiers were in a position to threaten the existence of Israel constitutes an insult not only to the intelligence of anyone capable of analyzing this sort of situation, but above all an insult to Zahal (Israeli military)[78]""

The war was an imperial campaign of expansion by Israel. That is obvious.

&gt;Why don't you point out the punishments. I laugh at these international laws. They have no punishments. 

The only reason that punishments haven't been enacted is because the US blocks any such attempts in the security council you clueless buffoon. You see it is up to the UN security council to decide what the punishments are.

&gt;Thus they aren't really laws.

That does not follow. Just because the US blocks any attempt by the International community to punish Israel doesn't mean they aren't really Laws. It means that you are an idiot.

&gt;They are just mutually agreed upon codes.

Like the code that murder, rape and theft is wrong? 

&gt;Well israel doesn't have to mutually agree to them. 

That's what criminals always claim. That they aren't subject to laws and moral standards dictating acceptable conduct and can do whatever they want.

,3,"No. Changing this one law will have a negative consequence if changed in a vacuum -- where no other legal or cultural changes are made.

Maturity is not decided by age but instead by culture and parenting. This leads to the bigger problem that current American culture of parenting couldn't handle it. Here's what I mean;

I was an American expat living in Europe when I was a teenager. I went to bars when I was 15 with kids who were even younger. I also knew plenty of American's overseas who's parents wouldn't let them drink and so they rarely went out with us. I believe their parents wanted them to stay kids (read naive) forever or least until they were out of the house and don't have good role models during an important period of maturing. Then they went to college and it was like the Hoover dam broke and all ""family values"" went out the window. It was irony at its finest.

The rule in my house was if you drank, you were not allowed to leave until the next morning. I had a mini-fridge/bar in my room so there was good incentive to stay in. Since driving wasn't legal until age 18 (one of the issues that must also be looked at) this was even easier for my parents to enforce. Not only was all of this perfectly legal, it was effective. And yes sometimes we got drunk. Really drunk. But then we also learned how to handle the alcohol and how to drink like (somewhat) responsible drinkers.

When I went to college, I wanted nothing more than to be able to sit in a bar, like I had been since I was 15 but couldn't without a fake ID. I quickly learned that American culture keeps its kids mentally immature long after the rest of the world has gone and grown up. In high school we are kids. In college we are tethered kids and now, according to the new health care bill, we can stay legally dependent on our parent's insurance until the age of 26 (I think that's what I read)!! That's crazy! 26? Seriously, I get why some think this is a good idea but dependent on our parents until the age of 26 for insurance but able to drink 10 years before is NEVER going to happen. To me this insurance change is a clear indication that the American perception of a dependent child is heading in the wrong direction, but I digress.

,-2,"&gt; Not everyone in Europe upgrades their phones after 12-18 months, and the cell providers here are now pushing 24 month contracts as the default.

That's irrelevant. As I said:

&gt; most of the phones from **users that care about app availability** will get cycled out so quickly

The people who hold on to older phones are people like me that couldn't care less because I don't use anything more advanced than SMS. Meanwhile users like my wife, who does care about app availability, and who is on an 18 month contract, are twitching to upgrade and willing to pay break clauses to upgrade early.

&gt; You can get exactly the same contract for less money (and no commitment) if you choose to go to the same teleco without a ""free"" phone.

I know. I'm currently about a year ""overdue"" for an upgrade, and as a result my contract is only 10 pounds a month for about 600 minutes. I was actually recommended not to upgrade, since deals as generous as the one I'm on aren't offered anymore, so I'm far better off buying a phone outright. 

But this is not how users that care about fancy phones behave. Half my office is on their second or third iPhone, for example.

&gt; It would be fantastic if phone manufacturers would release updates for 2 years after release, and it really wouldn't be that hard for them to do so

It wouldn't be hard, but why would they? They're in the business of pushing new phones, not giving people another reason to hold on to their old phones. It makes zero business sense unless consumers start making purchasing choices based on whether or not they're likely to get OS upgrades. 

&gt; As long as the UI updates quick enough, and you can watch a TV show on your phone whilst commuting, what else do you need CPU cycles for? Is there any need to have the latest phone, beyond compatibility?

Micro USB or bluetooth + Wireless HDMI coupled with a keyboard, mouse and a LCD TV or monitor with the appropriate interfaces = home computer. Or just Wireless HDMI = HD quality video player for your next TV.

In other words: Expect the manufacturers to find new reasons to push processing speed for quite a while longer.

&gt; One would think these kids would be amongst the quickest to update.

On the contrary, that's a segment that are focused on getting the most minutes and texts for the least amount of money. You'll find these are the type of users that may have multiple phones, but cheap ones, and often juggle 2-3 sim cards, often pay as you go, to get the best rates for whoever they need to all (my wife used to do that...)

,-2,"Write some more:  I just watched most of that Chomsky interview.  Yup, he's a bright guy.  At times I would have choked the ditsy bimbo and shouted in her face, ""You interrupt me again, and I'm biting off your needle pointed nose."" or some such.  Chomsky managed to avoid doing that!

But I don't know much about what Chomsky is saying, what the *Israeli right wing* is saying, what the various Arabs are saying, what the US has been doing, now is doing, etc.  So, write some more and educate me and maybe some others.  Here are some common issues to respond to:

(1) **Weapons.**  If the Arabs put down their weapons, then there would be peace.  If the Israelis put down their weapons, then all the Jews in Israel would be driven into the Mediterranean in another Holocaust.

(2) **Nukes.**  It is accepted that Israel has nuclear weapons.  Those weapons play a role something like why the US and NATO long had, maybe still has, nuclear weapons in Western Europe:  Without them, the conventional forces of the USSR, and maybe still now Russia, could overwhelm conventional forces in the West.  Or in Israel, without nuclear weapons, Israel would face a few hundred million Arabs from North Africa east at least to Afghanistan who want to see all the Jews in Israel thrown into the Mediterranean or worse.  In particular, with financial support at least from Iran and maybe from some of the Arab oil states, Lebanon, Syria, and Egypt, and maybe even Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq, would start another war to destroy Israel.

Chomsky seemed to be saying that Israel should give up its nuclear weapons.  Or maybe he was saying that Israel should sign the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and submit to the corresponding inspections.  If so, then how would Chomsky have Israel defend itself against a few hundred million angry Arabs?

(3) **Trouble Makers.**  Various important players don't want peace with Israel.  Instead they want to use hatred of Israel to get political power elsewhere in the Mideast.  Examples include Iran, Lebanon, and Syria, with the last two likely getting funding from the first.  Or, in Iran, Amadinanutjob wants things to scream about, and his favorite is Israel.  Or Amadinanutjob is eager to *fight for freedom* for *the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people*, fight with a few dollars of Iranian oil money and a lot of nasty words, and fight, fight, fight to the last Palestinian.

(4) **Losing Wars.**  The Palestinians over and over started wars to throw all the Jews into the Mediterranean and continue to scream that they want to destroy Israel.  But, in all those wars, the Palestinians lost, badly.  Or, in a word, they **LOST**.  Just what is it about the consequences of losing wars they don't understand?  Or the Palestinians think that, with no air force, no radar, no tanks, and with just a few crude rockets and a lot of rusty AK-47s they are going to throw all the Jews into the sea?  So, the Palestinians suffer.  Maybe if they'd try peace instead of war they'd do better.  Uh, who is better off, the screaming Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank or the Palestinians living in peace in Israel?  Or what do the Palestinians want to exchange with Israel:  Fresh fruits and vegetables for money or rocks and rockets for blockades and bullets?

(5) **The Gaza Example.** With Israel in Gaza, it was fairly peaceful, and then with US urging Israel pulled out.  Then Gaza got more violent and for a long period shot a lot of rockets into Israel.  So, Israel has tried to keep materials of war out of Gaza and actually invaded once to clean out the place.  The blockade and invasion are not very pretty, but neither are the rockets.  The problem in Gaza is that the political leaders there get support from Iran, etc. to keep the pot boiling.  So, until the suffering citizens in Gaza dump those leaders, Gaza will remain a problem.  The Palestinians in Gaza are not popular in Israel; actually they are not popular in Egypt either.  Maybe Amadinanutjob likes them.

(6) **West Bank.**  What Israel does in the West Bank is about the minimum to keep down organized violence against Israel.  The *occupation* is expensive for Israel, is bad *public relations*, is getting Israel at most very little very slowly, and is bad for the West Bank Arabs.

Some in Israel want slowly to take over the West Bank, and the long period of no deal gives them an opportunity and, really, provides a message to the Arabs:  Cut a deal or slowly see the West Bank disappear from a deal.

(7) **Two States.**  If there was a chance for a deal for *two states living side by side in peace* or some such, then that would have happened by now.

(8) **Hope.**  The hope is that the Arabs -- across North Africa east at least to Afghanistan -- in the streets just get tired of suffering from screaming about Israel and their politicians give up on trying to fight Israel.  In particular, the Arabs in Gaza, the West Bank, Syria, and Lebanon will give up fighting with Israel, sign a peace deal, and get on with their lives.

The Arabs have a **lot** to gain living in peace next to Israel which can provide them with world class contact with academics, medicine, technology, finance, and business and be good customers for a wide variety of products and services, etc.

Yes, from the Israelis the Arabs can learn how to play Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Bruch, Bloch, etc. on violin, but the Arabs likely won't care.

Yes, for food, the good food in the world is from France, Italy, China, Austria, ..., with Israel way down on the list -- Jewish food sucks!  Maybe Arab food is even worse!  But it's not about food.

,1,"&gt;30 miles is pretty reserved. I would say at least 50 miles would be the standard. At least for the US, china, japan, russia, england, etc.  

For what? Territorial waters are set and agreed upon internationally, this occurred outside of that.

&gt;200 miles is the economic zone limit. Israel was well within that.

Indeed, and if Israel had been setting up a rig, or mining the sea bed for minerals, or dealing with fisheries that might be fine (assuming that the area was within an Israeli economic zone), but they weren't, this was a ship being boarded and the crew attacked.  If this had been a Russian warship that action would have been utterly unthinkable after all and the blame would not have been on Russia..

&gt;And to top it off arguing that israel has no right to intercept smugglers is a joke. No country is going to say israel does not have the right to do this. Because all countries historically have patrolled much father out than 30 miles.

They do, but this ship wasn't smuggling anything anywhere, it was in international waters with no contraband (as far as international law is concerned) aboard. If it had been a pirate, slave or a drugs boat then there are treaties that allow certain action, it wasn't.

&gt;Depending on the metric, that would be +3 or +12. Not ""much further"". 

Look, there are maps available all over the place, the flotilla was at a Latitude od 32.64113 and a of Longitude:33.56727 when it was attacked, that is around 70 miles from the closest part of Israeli controlled territory.

&gt;I laugh at that comment. The ship admits it was going to violate israeli waters and was smuggling.

They were in international waters, so it wasn't violating anything and you can't 'smuggle' things that Israel has legislation against outside of waters where Israeli law applies.

&gt;If Turkey really want to back these smuggling vessels, israel can legally accept that as a declaration of war and a first strike. No way turkey is going to do that.

No, exactly.  Instead this will cause a diplomatic stink and we will see Israel suffering some diplomatic setbacks. Hell this incident seems to have managed to piss off both the Turks and the Greeks to the point where they are actually taking similar positions, that in itself is fairly impressive...

&gt;How is it wrong? Israel won the land in war. I accept a countries right to take land when it is the victim of aggressors.

Israel either has a responsibility as an occupier, or it is failing to ensure it's own population is treated in a manner consistent with international law. I would add that your acceptance of what rights countries have has no bearing on what international law says and what the UN security council has deemed to be acceptable.  Remember that these kinds of international statutes are essentially the entire reason for Israel's existence as a state, so they aren't something trivial to be ignored at will.  If they are trivial then surely the issue of countries or parties not recognising Israel is a non issue, which of course it is.

&gt;The reason why europe went back to the way it was, is because the US was willing to back a return to normalcy and occupy germany to make sure that happened.

Erm.. If we ignore the whole Soviet Union thing, the whole UK thing and various other elements, not to mention the fact that WWI taught us rather a lot of lessons on what not to do at the end of wars, and if we ignore the international conventions that came out of WWII then yes, your statement would be correct, as it stands it is either overly simplistic and omits most of the important factors, or it is simply wrong.

&gt;Right now israel is still attacked by suicide bombers and terrorists from neighboring countries.

Indeed they are, they are attacked by people in the areas that they occupy.  It is something that is very wrong and something that Israel has every right to deal with, much the same way as the UK had the right to deal with issues in N.I, but there are limits on what is acceptable and there are standards to be adhered to.  Not to mention the fact that Israel has no right to punish those living in a given area for the actions of a very small minority, certainly not the right to starve the population.

&gt;Nothing in the middle east suggests israel can safely put it's guard down. Until that changes, expect israel to keep the land it won and continue to build up it's defensive forces.

I would agree that Israel's safety is still threatened to a certain degree, I don't think that this threat is existential and as you keep pointing out, the US will back Israel.  So things like Israel's nuclear weapons are a problem (and Israel should be disarmed), Israel's attacks on its neigbours are a problem and Israel's refusal to protect the human rights of those within its authority are a problem.  In short Israel should be able to protect itself, but it should not in turn threaten everyone around it, that simply leads to more of a mess.

,42,"Plenty of people are suggesting that you avoid labels and enjoy what you are - although that's true, let me play the devil's advocate.

When people ask for labels, what they mean is ""Am I alone?"". Dude, you're not alone. What you probably are is a guy who likes women, who thinks about being fem, and likes cock. You could take on the label ""straight with some crossdress/femme tendencies"". Or maybe you're just a fun guy.

What you've described is common. I have a theory for it. Our (north american + western europe) society puts out the message that man is the desirer, man goes and takes, all else is ""gay"" and ""pussy"". Let's be real: being desired is really nice. A macho guy takes what he wants, but he's also the object of women's desires.

The furthest distance from macho is femme. To be desired, to have a cock perk up in your presence, is sexy to think about. Guys who roll that way - but not all the time - will typically introduce their partners to a bit of light roleplaying, get their girls to take control, take the reins, strap on a cock. Being desired, but staying with your self-described gender preference.

That's probably what you are. I'd say you're over the 5% range.

That's common enough to have a clear label, ""pegging"". Just that flip of control might be all you like, and the label would be ""guy who likes his girl to strap one on sometimes"" without going to ""crossdressing"".

Let me give you one tip. Please live by it, unlike me. *mention* this desire on either the second or third time you sleep with a woman. Just bring it up, lightly, while you're in early foreplay or post coital. Don't get heavy about it, just say that you've got some fantasies and you're not even sure whether you want to explore them. This will likely be super scary the first time or two, your heart will be in your throat, you'll want to put it off until #4, but trust me on this rule of thumb.

If you leave it past #3, you'll get all stuck on whether you can ever mention it. Leave it until you're married and you'll be sad for much of your life. Maybe you'll get dropped 50% of the time. *it's ok* - the outcome you're looking for, in some sense. ""living a lie"", as gay people call it, eats you inside like an acid.

The final bit of advice: if you find a woman who you click with out of bed and in bed, given that you're not in 100% vanilla terratory, be very, very nice to her. If there's something she likes and you don't, make sure you do it from time to time. Maybe it's a weepy movie night, maybe it's being the macho man once in a while against your personal nature, whatever. Make sure it goes both ways.

Part of the reason that it would become a mess would be that Turkey would claim to have been attacked, and claim that Article 5 of NATO requires the rest of NATO to come to the aid of Turkey to defeat Israel. The US would resist vigorously any such Article 5 declaration, and this would result in a rupture in NATO that would effectively end the organization. At a minimum, Turkey would end the US/NATO's ability to use Turkey to both stage attacks in Iraq and move supplies into Iraq [1]. 

In the past year, Turkey has been drifting away from ""The West."" Partly due to their inability to get admitted to the EU [2]. Partly due to a slow drift Islam-wards [3]. It is my belief that the Turkish government in Ankara has been wanting to break off relations with Israel, and Israeli forces attacking the flotilla was the perfect excuse. 

A fracture between the US and Turkey would result in Turkey's military stomping on the Kurds in Iraq. Those Kurds call their region in Iraq as ""Southern Kurdistan"" [4], and when Kurdish terrorists in Iraq attack Turkey, the US has bullied Turkey into ""turning the other cheek."" 

Notes:   
1 - Probably half of the supplies come into Iraq via Turkey, as Basra is the only port in Iraq that can handle cargo ships.  
2 - France and Cyprus have made ultimatums for Turkey's admission that is impossible for Turkey to comply with, and still remain Turkey.   
3 - [Ataturk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk)'s vision for Turkey was as a secular nation, with the Army as the enforcement mechanism for secularity. In the past, when the government started getting too religious, the army would march in, depose the government, hold elections, then march back to their barracks. With the government arresting many ""[deep state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_state)"" activists in the military, the military in Turkey is not likely to be able to depose an increasingly religious government.

Do you seriously imagine for one moment that it is possible to obtain accurate figures on rape from muslim countries, when some barely consider it a crime or the punishments for any woman alleging it are so brutal and the burden of proof so onerous?

It could equally be said that Soviet and Communist counties of Eastern Europe had extremely low crime levels, but of course these were brutal violent states where the aggression was committed mostly by the state against the people, not so different from most muslim counties, but you ignore this. The major difference between muslim and former Soviet states would be the status of women as non-persons in muslims counties which permits such appalling levels of endless oppression and violence against them.

I don't think you'll find many people on this subreddit disagreeing that highly religious societies, eg: Jamaica, USA, are violent while more secular societies such as Sweden and Holland are more peacable, but the point being made is that levels of violence in musliums are greater than in any industrialised western country, evidenced by the exodus of enormous numbers refugees leaving muslim countries for the West.

Open societies may inevitably have higher crime levels overall, it's a small price to pay for freedom and progress and civil rights.

Secondly, I said ""'will' aside"".  I was trying to illustrate that, whether you think anything would come of it, the British government is well placed to actual *do* something *if* they so wished.  That the UK very much does have the ability.

You seem to be getting lost in that Israel would use their large air force and navy to prevent the Royal Navy - I would argue that to do so would cost Israel far more then they could ever hope to recover.  One could literally say it would decimate the Israeli government; decimate in that Israel would be split and at least one in ten government supporters would be saying an act of war against the British was not in Israel's greater interests.  You're talking about the collapse of the Israeli government.  Make no mistake either that Britain would allow itself to be sunk into a direct war - even one that it would, not could, win.  Machiavellian politics would ensue.  The political impetus would be devastating.  You bring up the Falklands.  The US had a defense treaty with Southern America.  It stood back when it came to Britain versus Argentina.   It couldn't be seen to support her directly, although they did indirectly, and Britain was allowed to do what it needed to.  Whilst an American breakdown in UK trade would be more devastating for the UK it would still be catastrophic for the US, especially in this economic climate.  Same goes for the UK and Europe, the UK being a member of the European Union.  Economically Britain, the US and the Euro zone would be business as normal.  Domestically it might even be a  victory for the UK coalition, the leader of the Lib Dem party having already been very vocal about the situation in Palestine.
Ability wise the UK could break the embargo with a single frigate, just so long as it flew the British flag.  Israel could not attack it without losing its Security Council veto.  The country itself would split and the government collapse.  The PR ace they would hand to those who condemn the blockade would be epic.  

The ability is there.

The will?  Maybe, alas, 6 months is too short a timeframe.  This is more likely a salami scenario.  It is not in all likelihood going to be a sudden chop which brings about change (although an attack on the Royal Navy would certainly cover it), but surely you've seen Israeli credibility and political leverage diminish slice by slice?  And it is this sense that talk and posturing means a great deal, a catalyst to other more expedient measures.

Otherwise, the national security interest in delivering aid to Gaza is significant for the UK.  One of the main given reasons by Al Qaeda is the West's support for Israel.  It's reliance on Arab states and their resources is not to be belittled either.

&gt;The Nazis' objective was the systematic extermination of every Jew in Europe. Israel is seeking peace with its Palestinian neighbors. More than one million Arabs live as free and equal citizens in Israel. Of the Palestinians in the territories, 98 percent live under the civil administration of the Palestinian Authority. While Israel sometimes employs harsh measures against Palestinians in the territories to protect Israeli citizens – Jews and non-Jews – from the incessant campaign of terror waged by the PA and Islamic radicals, there is no plan to persecute, exterminate, or expel the Palestinian people. The view that Zionism is Nazism — there is no other way to understand the phrase “Zionist SS” — is not different in kind from the view that the moon is cheese. It is not only spectacularly wrong, it is also spectacularly unintelligent. I will not offend myself (that would be self-hate speech!) by patiently explaining why the State of Israel is unlike the Third Reich, except to say that nothing that has befallen the Palestinians under Israel's control may responsibly be compared to what befell the Jews under Germany's control, and that a considerable number of the people who have toiled diligently to find peace and justice for the Palestinians, and a solution to this savage conflict, have been Israeli, some of them even Israeli prime ministers. There is no support for the Palestinian cause this side of decency that can justify the locution “Zionist SS.” The absurdity of the charge is also clear from the demography of the disputed territories. While detractors make outrageous claims about Israel committing genocide or ethnic cleansing, the Palestinian population has continued to explode. In Gaza, for example, the population increased from 731,000 in July 1994 to 1,324,991 in 2004, an increase of 81 percent. The growth rate was 3.8 percent, one of the highest in the world. According to the UN, the total Palestinian population in all the disputed territories (they include Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem) was 1,006,000 in 1950, and rose to 1,094,000 in 1970, and exploded to 2,152,000 in 1990. Anthony Cordesman notes the increase “was the result of improvements in income and health services” made by Israel. The Palestinian population has continued to grow exponentially and was estimated in 2004 at more than 3.6 million.""",fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,0,0,True,1,1426328824,False,leokoz08816,,c0r9w4e,False,0,t5_2qqlo,1275510231,,t1_c0r9w4e,t3_ca7mn,t3_ca7mn

,3,"Yeah, the question is somewhat simplistic, I agree.  It arose from a graphic I saw in the context of the European debt fiasco that's ongoing.  The graphic (I believe it was from the NY Times ... I'll try to find it) showed all the debt circulating throughout Europe.  In almost every case it was a two-way street -- i.e. Country X owes country Y some amount, but Country Y also owes Country X some amount.

I realize the debt is mostly owed by private entities.  So, my curiosity was regarding how much other nations owe to U.S. entities, be they public or private.  The bottom lines is, how much money, in the form of debt payments from other nations, is flowing back into the U.S. economy.

Edit: [Found the graphic](http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/04/its-all-greek-to-me-understanding-the-debt-crisis-in-europe/).",AskReddit,0,0,True,3,1426328836,False,[deleted],,c0r9x01,False,0,t5_2qh1i,1275510956,,t1_c0r9x01,t1_c0r9w20,t3_caqle
,8,"Hijacking boats in international waters and killing passengers is, of course, a serious crime.  The editors of the London Guardian are quite right to say that: “If an armed group of Somali pirates had yesterday boarded six vessels on the high seas, killing at least 10 passengers and injuring many more, a NATO taskforce would today be heading for the Somali coast.”

It is worth bearing in mind that the crime is nothing new.  For decades, Israel has been hijacking boats in international waters between Cyprus and Lebanon, killing or kidnapping passengers, sometimes bringing them to prisons in Israel including secret prison/torture chambers, sometimes holding them as hostages for many years.

Israel assumes that it can carry out such crimes with impunity because the U.S. tolerates them and Europe generally follows the U.S. lead.

Much the same is true of Israel’s pretext for its latest crime: that the Freedom Flotilla was bringing materials that could be used for bunkers for rockets.  Putting aside the absurdity, if Israel were interested in stopping Hamas rockets it knows exactly how to proceed: accept Hamas offers for a ceasefire.

In June 2008, Israel and Hamas reached a cease-fire agreement. The Israeli government formally acknowledges that until Israel broke the agreeement on November 4, invading Gaza and killing half a dozen Hamas activists, Hamas did not fire a single rocket. Hamas offered to renew the ceasefire. The Israeli cabinet considered the offer and rejected it, preferring to launch its murderous and destructive Operation Cast Lead on December 27.  Evidently, there is no justification for the use of force “in self-defense” unless peaceful means have been exhausted.  In this case they were not even tried, although—or perhaps because—there was every reason to suppose that they would succeed. Operation Cast Lead is therefore sheer criminal aggression, with no credible pretext, and the same is true of Israel’s current resort to force.

The siege of Gaza itself does not have the slightest credible pretext.  It was imposed by the U.S. and Israel in January 2006 to punish Palestinians because they voted “the wrong way” in a free election, and it was sharply intensified in July 2007 when Hamas blocked a U.S.-Israeli attempt to overthrow the elected government in a military coup, installing Fatah strongman Muhammad Dahlan.  The siege is savage and cruel, designed to keep the caged animals barely alive so as to fend off international protest, but hardly more than that.  It is the latest stage of long-standing Israeli plans, backed by the U.S., to separate Gaza from the West Bank.

These are only the bare outlines of very ugly policies, in which Egypt is complicit as well.

Once he understands that that was a war crime, one should understand that blockading a country, without a formal declaration of war *is* also a war crime. Israel has not issued any formal declaration of war against Palestine, so they are in the wrong about this as well. They can justify this with whatever bullshit they want. It is still a war crime.

It is also, looked at with a clear eye, profoundly racist and self-contradictory (if a Muslim man is gay, do you defend his right to be gay or his community's right to murder him for it?), but under postmodernism and multiculturalism the idea that all *individual* humans are equal has given way to the idea that all *group cultures* are equally ""right"".

Being a Canadian, you probably have no issue with long days and short nights on summer time? Because at the time of summer solstice it only goes a little bit darker for 2-3 hours at night here. Even then it's perfectly light to read a book tbh (due to reflecting sunlight from the upper clouds)... I mention because a lot of tourists complain about not being able to sleep at night here on summer time. So if you think you might be one of them, I suggest to steal a pair of eyeshades from the airplane. :)

In Tallinn you definitely need to see the Old Town, but that's probably a no-brainer. KUMU (a museum), some churches (St.Olaf's was once the tallest building in Europe for example), other museums, also some views from top of buildings and from the other side of the bay would be cool I guess (especially at the dusk when the sky turns bright red). All depends on how long are you planning to stay here though? Visiting another town/city Tartu might be an experience.

first graph is number of gun related crimes not including air guns

98 is first year after hand gun ban 5K and the trend if rising year on year.

4th graph is types of weapons used in gun crimes for the year 2006/7
43% the largest single type of weapon used in gun crimes for the years 2006/7 is hand guns these are the very weapons that were banned so any registers and legal hand guns are gone. add in 3% for sawn off shot guns which are also illegal to own.
plane and simple 46% of all gun crime from that year is categorically committed by illegal weapons. 
legal fire arms are really used in crime barring the mentally flipped but they will use anything.
we live within an open boarders Europe were criminals can smuggle low quantity of anything including weapons very easily as the stats prove the criminals have easy accesses to illegal firearms.

,1,"To be honest I don't really know of many great sources for more current events reports or analyses. I'm more interested in the history of the conflict than the current goings-on because history doesn't tend to be nearly as volatile in research or discussion. My favorite sources are newspaper archives (mostly British or American periodicals since those are the ones I can read the easiest :P) or first-hand accounts. Newspapers are great because you can get a feel for what was going on locally, internationally, and also in the heads of the general populous thanks to the editorial pages. Biographies (auto- or not) are also good reading, since you can cross-check the perspective of the writer or the subject with third-person documentation and outside analysis to help you get a better picture.

Interestingly, movies can also be good for starting places. Period pieces about the pre-Holocaust Zionist movement, Europe in the 30s and 40s, etc. are all good starting places since they often set themselves in a non-fictional background and reference lots of current (at the time) events to make the setting seem more authentic. You can also judge what the public opinion on the subject or on the time period was at the time when the film was made by whatever slant the film appears to take, and what got written about it when it was released. I don't tend to watch many movies though.

I think it's possible to have a non-biased article on the debate, you just have to avoid people who tend to enjoy assigning 100% of the blame to either side, which rules out most sources. This happens to be a good starting place for a history of the entire region from ancient times up until recently, with some good recommendations for further reading sprinkled throughout the article and on the website.

I was particularly moved by what you said about the cultural revolution in china, I remember a friend being really upset in the eighth grade that the Taliban was wrecking 100 ft statues of the Buddha in afghanistan.  He wasn't muslim or buddhist, but I agree with you that you don't have to be a part of someone else's religion to value their cultural inheritance.

What can happen when people dialogue across ideological divides is that particular things the other person says stick out.  This sentence stuck out to me:

&gt;But because all ideas should have the same chance, and once these ideas were given that chance they could be laid to rest more easily.

I completely agree with this sentiment, I think that over the long term, investigating something that isn't true can only reveal how unfounded it is.

The reason it stuck out, though, was because I have a deeply held belief that (speaking just about the West) while there isn't a smaller percentage of people today who are well educated in matters of religion then there've been in other times, I think there are fewer people who know who is better and who is worse educated about religion.

I think a lot of the unhinging of Christianity by the intellectual powers that be in Europe and America over the last 500 years has been because of the exploration of the world and the frontiers of science.  The intelligentsia, in their push to universalize everything, outstripped christianity's ability in its particular language to describe to them the world beyond christendom, and in their frustration, they moved on.  I don't think of advances in biology or cosmology being critical in unhinging religion publicly, but I do think that they can add fuel to the fire when someone already sees a conflict between received teaching and what they can discover on their own.

The trouble always comes when the pupils grow up and have to become teachers themselves.  When all of the ""authorities"" have been put out to pasture, and the young rebels are put in charge, that is when the practical realities start to set in.  They realize that no one could ever have ""enforced dogmas"" the way that they had imagined and that it's trouble enough just trying to keep the ball rolling without controlling everybody's thoughts.

That ended up being more confrontational than I thought it would be and I never got around to making my point that good, bad, or indifferent, believer or non-believer, understanding of what it is that the people who went before us actually believed should be in the hands of PhD's the way that many other things are.  I think that if people could separate themselves from the abrahamic religions the way that they can from hinduism/buddhism/taoism that they would understand that they don't know anything about them until they learn about them.

It is really important for non-believers to agitate in the public sphere and ensure that social conservatives aren't controlling their lives and everything, but in the intellectual sphere, westerners impoverish themselves when they decide that they understand and reject something that they haven't been able to get good information about.

There is plenty of bad science out there, Deepak Chopra illustrates that somebody can spend a lot of time with science and not write about it well.  Likewise people can spend a lot of time with religion and not really overlap at all with things that would end up in oxford handbooks and blackwell's anthologies.  I think that it's perfectly legitimate to be an atheist because a person hasn't personally encountered anything that has been both ""religious"" and compelling.  I think it's legitimate for somebody to decide that they don't want to invest the time and that they just want to live their lives.  I think it makes sense for somebody to get into the history of christian thought, reading secondary literature, talking with people who have rigorous understandings of christianity, and see how somebody reasonable could invest their lives in it and still either have personal hangups, or simply decide that it isn't for them.

On the other hand, dismissing a body of texts outright, deciding that if somebody got through the City of God, the Sayings of the Desert Fathers or the Summa Theologica that it would be as intellectually stimulating as spending an afternoon at an amusement park or watching television is unreasonable.

I think that there's a tipping point some where and that if Kansas board of education members had grown up where there had been enough good science teachers that there wouldn't have been any trouble.  I don't think that each one of those board members would have needed a high quality education, it wouldn't have been politically viable to oppose evolution if everybody understood what it was.

Likewise, people wouldn't need a religious education for it to no longer be politically viable to propose that religion has only ever and could only ever be used to control people's minds and keep them docile, if enough people understood what Christianity is, everybody wouldn't necessarily be beating down the doors to join up, far from it.  But the idea that make believe is something that's made up so that people can feel good isn't a very rigorous one.


I'm really sorry that I dumped all this text on you, I hope you know it isn't about you, I am projecting what I wish I had said in different conversations that I've had before.  At the same time, I would be interested to hear what you think if you should choose to write a response.

Obviously there is more and more. However knowing this is not enough. You need a right estimate for energy content of cow shit. My order of magnitude guess is that it is probably comparable with energy actually used by cows, which is probably about the same order of magnitude as energy used by horse.

Now we know some examples of horse powered civilizations. European middle ages is probably a good example. Obviously this was not a civilization with very high production of energy. Which probably means that if we want to preserve first world standard of living (and not middle ages standard of living) biogas from cow shit is not likely to make a significant impact.

I did not even do any calculations here, but I did some reasoning about orders of magnitude. This is a kind of reasoning sorely lacking by people suggesting that renewables can solve our energy problems. 

It is a mistake to assume that if you see a rising trend it will keep rising forever. People who bet on US home prices rising learned it a hard way.  If something can not go forever it will stop. This is true even for biogas and for solar power stations. 

(BTW, I actually believe cow shit gasification is not a bad idea -- it keeps methane away from atmosphere and methane is a stronger greenhouse gas then a resulting CO2. But it will not produce a lot of energy).

Cher député,

Je vous écris pour vous communiquer mes inquiétudes concernant le projet de loi C-32 déposé par le gouvernement, que j’ai lu sommairement.

Ce projet de loi vise à modifier la loi sur le droit d’auteur.

Une des dispositions de la loi établit que si une œuvre sur support numérique est munie d’une protection anticopie, les droits du distributeur auront préséance sur les droits du consommateur (articles 41 et plus de la loi)

http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=4580265&amp;Mode=1&amp;Language=F&amp;File=72#16


Un des effets perverts de cette disposition est que certains usages parfaitement légaux seront rendus impossible à effectuer sans violer la loi. 

Par exemple, les films sur support DVD provenant de l’extérieur de l’Amérique du Nord (dite «zone 1») ne pourront pas être lus sur des appareils nord-américains sans violer la loi.

Cela revient à dire que les canadiens ne pourront pas visionner des films provenant d’Europe ou d’Asie, fussent-ils légalement acquis.

Il est difficile de croire que le Canada, pays d’immigration par excellence, empêche ses citoyens de visionner des films provenant de leurs pays d’origine, et soient condamnés à ne pouvoir visionner légalement que ce que les distributeurs nord-américain daignent mettre sur le marché.

Je suis moi-même propriétaire de quelques films sur DVDs édités en France, acquis lors de voyages en France. Si ce projet de loi passe tel quel, je ne pourrai pas légalement regarder ces films, car l’appareil requis sera considéré hors-la-loi, car le système de segmentation en zones géographiques est en fait un système de contrôle de marché plutôt que de contrôle de copie.


Je compte sur vous pour faire le nécéssaire pour que le droit de regarder des films légalement acquis à l’étranger soit intégralement préservé.

For land line phones, you only pay for calls you make, and not the ones you receive.  However, when cell phones came out, the carriers were worried about people with cell phones never making calls and only receiving calls from land line phones.  Then there isn't anyone paying extra for the added cost of a cell call.  So we got accustomed to paying for minutes on cell phones whether we initiated the call or not.  When SMS came about, they just followed the same practice.

Every now and again you'll get someone telling you not to text them anymore because they don't have a text plan, but that's becoming more and more rare.

Well, then either Turkey is incorrect, or I am. I'm accepting the IDF claims that they did in fact have knives, which does not seem at all unusual for a boat crew to me. The point is that there was no evidence that there was ever any intention of delivering anything but humanitarian aid, which is desperately needed according the UN and Amnesty International. Israel did not attempt other methods of stopping the ships before invading them and shooting the passengers. Therefore, the passengers had a legal right to defend themselves since they were in international waters. Those passengers by the way, were not members of Hamas. They were mostly Turkish, European and American civilians.

--

Dear MP,

I'm writing to communicate my concerns regarding bill C-32 tabled by the government, which I have briefly read.

This bill seeks to modify copyright law.

One of the provisions of the act provides that if a digital work is provided with copy protection, the distributor's rights will have precedence over the rights of the consumer (articles 41+ of the bill).

http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=4580265&amp;Mode=1&amp;Language=F&amp;File=72#16

One of the warped effects of this provision is that certain perfectly legal usages will be rendered impossible without breaking the law.

For example, DVD movies from outside North America (aka Zone 1) will not be able to be played on North American equipment without breaking the law.

This means that Canadians cannot watch films from Europe or Asia, even had they been legally acquired.

It's hard to belieev that Canada, archetypal country of immigration, prevents its citizens from watching films from their home countries, and punishes them by only allowing legal viewing of what North American distributors deign to put on the market.

I am myself the owner of some DVDs published in France, acquired while traveling in France.   If this bill passes as is, I can not legally view these films, because the device required will be considered illegal, because the system of geographical segmentation is actually a system of market control rather than copy control.

I am counting on you to do what is necessary in order to preserve the integrity of the right to watch legally acquired foreign films.

http://www.diis.dk/graphics/Publications/WP2006/DIIS%20WP%202006-7.web.pdf

""Turkish authorities began their own domestic criminal investigation of IHH as early as December 1997, when sources revealed that leaders of IHH were purchasing automatic weapons from other regional Islamic militant groups. IHH’s bureau in Istanbul was thoroughly searched, and its local officers were arrested. Security forces uncovered an array of disturbing items, including firearms, explosives, bomb-making instructions, and a “jihad flag.” After analyzing seized IHH documents, Turkish authorities concluded that “detained members of IHH were going to fight in Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Chechnya.”

According to a French intelligence report, the terrorist infiltration of IHH extended to its most senior ranks. The report, written by famed counterterrorism magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguiere, revealed that IHH President Bulent Yildrim had directly conspired in the mid-1990s to “recruit veteran soldiers in anticipation of the coming holy war [jihad]. In particular, some men were sent into war zones in Muslim countries in order to acquire combat experience.”

Furthermore, in the hopes of “obtaining political support from these countries, financial aid was transferred [on behalf of IHH], as well as caches of firearms, knives, and pre-fabricated explosives.” An examination of IHH’s phone records in Istanbul showed repeated telephone calls in 1996 to an Al-Qaida guesthouse in Milan and various Algerian terrorist operatives active elsewhere in Europe – including the notorious Abu el-Ma`ali, who has been subsequently termed by U.S. officials as a “junior Osama Bin Laden.”",politics,0,0,True,1,1426329346,False,DrakeBishoff,,c0rayqh,False,0,t5_2cneq,1275541406,,t1_c0rayqh,t1_c0r8psb,t3_cahte

At the end of the day, siding against Israel would make US-Turkish relations rather complicated and difficult.  The US might still need Turkey as a base for the ongoing conflict in Iraq, but if it ever came to having to decide between the two countries, they'd still side with Israel.  Hell, it might even encourage them to be more sympathetic to the Kurdish separatists (even if it would never amount to anything, simply a realistic looking threat would freak Turkey out).  

I honestly don't know who would win in a war between the two countries, but if Israel pulled the nuke card (which, if Turkey was joined by other nations, they might) it would be a short fight.  And that's assuming the US doesn't get involved, which can't be ruled out, regardless of pretty much anything.  And I'd wager Turkey is aware of this.

*It is the usual modus operandi of Arab rulers...* The Turks aren't Arab, but I know what you were getting at, and there's validity to it.

There is a project called Desert-Tec http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertec (better information available in German) which is a concept creating power with http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_heating the distribution problem will be with potentially solved with http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-voltage_direct_current DC transport. This project will lead to a Trans-European Super Energy Grid. 

The other problem involved the storage of energy is not as severe as you may think. Since we are already able to store energy for several days. But this is to expensive right now and will not be solved early. Still the costs for Solar Energy are 12 cent per KWh right now while Nuclear Energy does cost (at least since trashing is expensive) 10-12 cent per KWh. While the solar cells produced nowadays are not even produced in really mass production ( and the sold solar cells do have an efficiency about 12-16% - the being ready to produce got over 20% (thin layer) and nearly 28% (thick layer) as far as I know ). 

If we just add the storage costs to the costs of the production we get an energy source which might be cheaper than the last piece of oil in the Gulf of Mexico. 

Solar Energy will most likely not be the only energy source used, as nowadays oil, gas, coal, wind, solar, geothermic &amp; strange organic stuff is used to produce energy. 

Furthermore most energy is needed at the day since a huge percentage of fabrics do work mainly then. Additionally you can cut down the amount of energy needed with green products (refrigerator) as already done in Germany. The building of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_house will also help a lot - and also save money. 

Still there are things like the use of fossil-fuel powered cars which will become quite expensive in the next 50 years (even with an attack of Iran).

http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM

Livestock agriculture is a major driving force behind environmental degradation. Additionally, it is immensely costly in terms of fossil fuel and freshwater usage. It's highly inefficient:

""In simple numeric terms, livestock actually detract more from total food supply than they provide. Livestock now consume more human edible protein than they produce. In fact, livestock consume 77 million tonnes of protein contained in feedstuff that could potentially be used for human nutrition, whereas only 58 million tonnes of protein are contained in food products that livestock supply. In terms of dietary energy, the relative loss is much higher. This is a result of the recent trend towards more concentrate-based diets for pigs and poultry, with nutritional requirements more similar to humans than ruminants.""

and

""The livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global."" 

To address your concerns specifically:

&gt;So, Iceland and Norway are going to switch to a vegan diet? Who will be growing their fresh fruits and veggies?

http://www.iceland.is/economy-and-industry/agriculture//nr/29

""Crops  
Grain is grown in very limited quantites in Iceland and most agricultural land is devoted to grass for production of hay and silage as fodder for sheep and cattle, which are the main livestock types in Icelandic farming. Other crops include potatoes (the harvest of which meets about 80% of domestic consumption), turnips and carrots. Cultivation of vegetables and flowers in geothermally heated greenhouses is extensive. In total, greenhouses produced about 800 tonnes of tomatoes in 1998, which was two-thirds of annual consumption. By area under cultivation, cucumbers come second in importance after tomatoes, and the output of 700 tonnes supplies over 70% of domestic demand.""

http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Europe/Norway-AGRICULTURE.html

""The leading crops in 1998 were cereals—particularly barley, wheat, and oats (total output of 1.3 million metric tons)—and potatoes (400,320 tons)."" ... ""fruits, vegetables, and most grains are all imported.""

What they are not self-sufficient in, they can import. Additionally, it would not take much effort to increase domestic production, especially by reducing financial, energy, and resource inputs to livestock agriculture.

&gt;from cows in lands that are too dry to grow crops?

What are those cows eating?

http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Aug97/livestock.hrs.html

""""If all the grain currently fed to livestock in the United States were consumed directly by people, the number of people who could be fed would be nearly 800 million,"" David Pimentel, professor of ecology in Cornell University's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, reported at the July 24-26 meeting of the Canadian Society of Animal Science in Montreal. Or, if those grains were exported, it would boost the U.S. trade balance by $80 billion a year, Pimentel estimated.""

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_effects_of_meat_production

""According to the vegetarian author John Robbins, it roughly takes 60, 108, 168, and 229 pounds of water to produce a pound of potatoes, wheat, corn and rice respectively. He reports that a pound of beef however, requires 12,000 gallons of water.""

&gt;How are we going to ship the 2-3 times extra volume of food to places that cannot grow enough vegetation?

Internalize externalities of pollution, habitat destruction, and depletion of wild stocks through pricing signals, and encourage local production via carbon taxes. Make use of more sophisticated and sustainable agricultural techniques, rather than very inefficient use of livestock to process grasses and grains.

&gt;Does the world even have enough arable land to grow a vegan diet for 7 Billion people?

The vast majority of grain produced in the Western world goes to feed livestock. The Amazon is being cut down not to feed people directly, but to feed cattle. A vegetarian diet requires a fraction of the arable land for meat production.

Meat and dairy are not necessities, but costly luxuries that are driving the loss of natural habitat, potable water, topsoil, and increasing pollution and greenhouse gasses.

&gt;The fact that you yourself are telling me that it's unsuitable for treatment indicates that you yourself would not willingly pay for it! 

Yet there are plenty of morons who are still very willing to. 

&gt;Your assumption is that the people in government will both know what the best treatments are, and mandate them by law. Unwarranted assumption #7

Yeah, because no-one knows better than you, right? No-one can possibly have more expertise in any given field than you, right? You arrogant sack of cocks. 

&gt;Pseudoscience cannot overcome real medicine in a free market. 

Yet, in history, it did. Yet, today, it does. 

&gt;People will not move from something with well-established success as a treatment to something which has been shown to fail as a treatment, if they have any reliable information whatsoever about the treatments.  

Yes, and where are you going to get this reliable information? From the quacks themselves? From doctors who would be much better employed actually getting on with some fucking medicine? If only there was some impartial regulatory body with the sole remit to investigate this sort of thing. Maybe, I dunno, gubmint scientists?

Thankfully, we have an internet to provide that information - the same internet which your government is trying to censor with the ""Digital Economy Act.""

&gt;Thankfully, we have an internet to provide that information - the same internet which your government is trying to censor with the ""Digital Economy Act.""

Now this is the part of your post I've been looking forward to. The part I waded through all your humourless libertarian bullshit just to savour. Because I knew libertarians were naive (and humourless, selfish, whiny, cowardly, thick... but I digress), but this really takes the cake. You're going to get your reliable information from the *internet*? Hahaha.

Let me tell you about the reliability of the internet. There was a thread on the SomethingAwful forums earlier this year. It was an ongoing contest to vandalise wikipedia - to make edits that were completely false, yet plausible. At least one participant described how they had gone onto the page for various drugs and fucked around with the recommended doses, knowing that almost no-one in all the world would have the inclination to check whether the edit was total bollocks. Before you write this off as ""just wikipedia,"" you ought to know that even an otherwise good doctor will occasionally be a bone-idle bastard and just look something up on wikipedia rather than trawl journals for an hour. This is because humans are not the omniscient, perfectly rational beings that libertarianism requires to function. 

Also, the Digital Economy Act is nothing to do with censoring the internet, you tard. 

So there we have it. Solid evidence that libertarians care nought for things like facts once they get an idea into their noggins. Here we have an individual who believes every bit of paranoid hogwash he's ever heard about the UK, and feels free to judge its inhabitants based on that despite clearly never having actually set foot there. This is exactly the sort of person who deserves nothing more than dismissal with with a rolled eye and back-and-forth jerk of the wrist.

Really? Really? I didn't see any wall around Batman last time I was there. Didn't see a naval blockade either.

&gt; It is the usual modus operandi of Arab rulers, blame Israel for everything.

It is, but Turkey != Arab and as Islamist as Tayyip is he's not an Arab. Have you ever been to Turkey? To imply that Turkey is Arab suggests that you haven't, serious schoolboy error.

&gt; We will see how he will fare at the polls and if his decision to give up joining the EU and align himself with the popular democracies in the Middle East like Iran, Syria at Israel's expense will pay off long term.

It's Tayyip that's been pushing for EU ascession. CHP have been fairly light on the matter as a lot of Turks vary from not caring to being quite resentful of Europe for various reasons, including being treated as second class citizens. As for aligning with Iran and Syria they've been less hostile for years but there's zero chance of aligning with either of those as the military wouldn't stand for it and the US would definitely be against it (and the US is an important ally and trading partner).

Here's the thing, until recently Turkey was acting as a neutral mediator as a friend of both Israel and the Arab states. The Lebanon and Gaza incursions made it politically unacceptable for Turkey to remain neutral but they still tried to remain partially friendly. The act of piracy committed by Israel against Turkish people makes it now impossible to be anything other than an enemy of Turkey in the short term unless justice is served. I'm sure there's discussions and negotiations going on, but Turkey has had it's blood shed and will want an eye for an eye. Add to the fact that the Turks are master negotiators and you're talking about two eyes for the price of one.

There will be a lot of posturing and Tayyip will need something that makes it look like he's achieved a result before the election.

a huge advantage of these energy sources is their potential to decentralize supply, especially in a huge country like the u.s. which spans several time zones).

* Anne Frank House (do it SOBER)

* Dutch Resistance Museum (I did both of these interesting but HIGHLY depressing museums back to back, then got a much needed pick me up in a coffeeshop)

* Van Gogh Museum

* Eat Frittes, they are everywhere and so good, especially useful if you've been hitting coffeeshops.

Belgium

* [Cantillon Brewery](http://vegantraveller.tumblr.com/post/643609075/the-cantillon-brewery)

* Drink at the Delirium bar - it's a tad touristy but the beer selection is great.  Also for a cultural experience, go there during the day, watch for kids with their parents to order child size glasses of beer.

* Mannequin Pis (little boy peeing statue)

* Grand Place (fantastic architecture exhibited in the guild hall buildings)

* Belgian Centre for Comic Strip Art - Comic Strips are a huge part of Belgian culture.  You can see Strumpfs, which became smurfs in America.

* In Brussels, I found it very hard to navigate the city streets, they are very windy, and signs are not well placed.  If you are European, maybe you'll be used to navigating old cities already, but for me (American) it was quite difficult.

Its all I have to say.

Israel v the Palestinians

Israel is the regional power. It is the big mean dog, it has all that it wants, the land, military dominance over all its neighbors, trade, the coverage of the worlds only super power. Therefore Israel wants to maintain the current power status quo as is. Israel wants to impose its will on a defeated people and call this peace Those who rule others always want that kind of peace.

I dont expect everyone to agree with the Palestinian POV but at least to understand it.

Palestinians do not place the same premium on peace the Israelis do. This is because they have very little. They have issues that need addressing, the right of return, the occupation of the West Bank, the annexation of Jerusalem, the economic shut down, the total control and blockade of their areas. They see peace as surrender. This is why they keep firing rockets and launching suicide attack. They want justice. The ruled always do.

To get Peace the Israelis have to address issues they simply do not want to. Until Israel is prepared to do that, there will not be peace.

It can be done, The UK showed the way when it talked to the IRA with no pre-condtions. No, ""edit the United Ireland part of your charter"" before we talk. The commander of the Londonderry IRA is now a UK member of parliament and Northern Ireland is still a part of the UK. By talking to the extremists, you fractionalise them, those that want peace, and those that want to fight. To strengthen the hand of those that want peace serious concessions have to be made, when those that want to derail the peace talks strike with rocket attacks and car bombs you have to be very careful with retaliation. Its a long slow road, but there was a time when Northern Ireland looked as hopeless as Palestine, but look at it now. The native population in the protestant enclave in the north have put their desire for a united Ireland on hold. They no longer shelter the men of violence. They settled for the rewards of peace ( jobs, investment, a predicable future ) and the changes made to the power structure and institutions giving them a voice in the protestant enclave.


The solution to Israels problems is obvious. All the peace plans are essentially the same. Clinton's Peace Plan, the Nusseiba-Ayalon Plan, the Saudi Peace Initiative, Bush’s Road Map, Oslo, Taba summit are all similar

They all include clear measures that Israel has to take in order to make peace:

1.Dismantle the settlements.   
2.Withdraw its soldiers and civilians from the occupied territories.      
3.Allow the creation a viable Palestinian state.    
4.find a solution for the Palestinian refugees' right of return. A massive compensation package?     
5.Find a way to guarantee Israeli security. Altho' I believe having nuke addresses that.      
6.A creative way to reward Israel for giving up what it feels it has won in war.      

The problem is Israel will not to go along with these plans. At some point the talks will fail. Developing new plans is a waste of time. Israel wants land, specifically the West Bank. Israel has not dismantled a single settlement built there, and has never ceased to take Palestinian lands under the guise of security. This is the underlying tactic. The aim is to create a ""reality on the ground"" where it become impossible to uproot 100,000's of settlers. The Palestinians will become a servant population within this greater Israel ruled by a compliant Palestinian authority.

My greatest insight occurred while living in Israel. I came to realize Israel is a typical colonialist project. Europeans jews using American Jewish wealth, politics and violence to transfer a native population from their land using using a tried and true tactic. You start friendly, grow in strength, then remove more natives, when they see what is happening and they resist play the ""we are the victims of native violence"" card and use greater violence to remove greater numbers. Continue until you got all you want. I think the map posted in this thread shows that perfectly.

See the Founding of the USA, Australia, South Africa etc for details.

PS. Look into the Taba summit. Any lasting peace agreement will look like that. Pity it's a vote loser in Israel

* Ali Haydar Bengi, 39, from Diyarbakir, the largest city in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast.

* Ibrahim Bilgen, 61, an electrical engineer from the southeastern town of Siirt and the father of one son, Anatolian reported.

* **Furkan Dogan, 19**, was a Turkish-American traveling with a US passport, Anatolian said. A forensic report said he was shot at close range, with four bullets in his head and one in his chest, the agency said.

* Cevdet Kiliclar, 38, a journalist born in the central Turkish town of Kayseri, Anatolian said. He was also employed by the IHH in Istanbul.

* Cengiz Songur, 47, from the Aegean port city of Izmir.

* Cetin Topcuoglu, 54, a former European taekwondo champion who later worked as a coach for Turkey's national team, an official from the Turkish Taekwondo Federation said. Topcuoglu lived in the southern city of Adana.

* Fahri Yaldiz, 43, a firefighter and father of four from the southern town of Adiyaman, Anatolian reported. His brother Habip told the agency that Fahri had long wanted to die fighting in Israel to become a ""martyr.""

,1,"FORT WORTH, Texas – UST Mamiya – maker of the world’s finest carbon-fiber golf shafts – confirms the winners of the PGA Tour’s Valero Texas Open and Champions Tour’s Regions Charity Classic relied on its Proforce V2 shafts.

Recording the company’s seventh PGA Tour victory this season, the Valero Texas Open champion played the popular shaft model in his driver (86-gram, x-flex) and two fairway woods (96-gram, x-flex).

Also utilizing Proforce V2 shafts, the winner of the Regions Charity Classic recorded three rounds in the 60s to claim the company’s 14th worldwide win this season. UST Mamiya users have captured titles on the PGA, PGA European, Champions, Nationwide and PGA European Senior Tours in 2010.

“Both of these outstanding performances were highlighted by great ball striking that lead to scoring opportunities,” says Gene Simpson, COO of UST Mamiya.  “Our technologically advanced shafts are known for providing tremendous distance and accuracy, as well as the consistent reliability trusted by a substantial and growing number of the world’s best players.”

The Proforce V2 is designed for players seeking a flatter, more penetrating ball flight. It features a firm tip section that promotes medium launch and increased ball speed for optimum distance. Its low-torque design prevents the clubhead from twisting on impact, reduces back spin and tightens shot dispersion. Like all UST Mamiya shafts, the Proforce V2 uses superior materials and design to produce a very stable and consistent platform.  

Likened to the precision of automaker Lexus, all UST Mamiya carbon-fiber shafts are unrivaled in quality attributed to world-class engineering, premium-selected raw materials and handcrafted, repeatable production techniques. Tight tolerances, constant taper design and low-resin content enhance feel during the golf swing.

UST Mamiya produces 35 shaft models within the ATTAS and Proforce product lines:

•    ATTAS – Introduced in Japan in early 2009 and in North America late last year, this premium shaft was immediately adopted by Tour players globally. Innovatively engineered with smooth-bending properties throughout the shaft’s constant taper design, more energy is transferred to the ball for instant feedback with greater distance. Ultra-thin carbon fibers optimize feel and allow the shaft to maintain its shape for consistent, accurate shots. ATTAS is distinguished by its tri-color look, notably its atomic orange.

•    Proforce – Famous for its bright gold color and contributing to multiple major-tournament victories, Proforce shafts have been UST Mamiya’s flagship since winning the 1999 Masters. The V2 incorporates the company’s original “tip technology,” masterfully balancing torque, weight, spin and launch angle for extraordinary power off the tee. The latest in the Proforce series, the AXIVCore features four-axis material promoting stability, control and ease of swing for increased ball speed.

About UST Mamiya

Furthermore, the EU is a supranational organization, not a government, and for it to present itself as such would be a disingenuous usurpation of its role as an economic stability organ.  

Note that although I do not like the EU as such, I am not questioning its legitimacy -- just its suitability to be a representative power in the United Nations, particularly in the UNSC, just like a NAFTA, MERCOSUR, or ASEAN, although these are admittedly less developed and integrated than the EU, would not be suitable as representatives of their regions.

The EU would also not be able to exercise a consistent voice founded in historical stability; even if you go way out on a limb and include the treaty of Rome, it's had at most ~50 years of existence.  That means about 1/4 of the maturity of the UNSC's youngest permanent member it its founding, and that's a country that was vastly more integrated and stable at the time.  

The only reason I could see for including the EU would be a symbolic one, and that's not a good rationale for letting someone into what should be the ultimate last-ditch club of stability guarantors.

For exact reason you mentioned (unelected leaders), I believe that the current form of the UNSC is the least worst solution.  Any attempt to democratize it without addressing the underlying inequalities or injustices that would drive large blocs of countries to cynically and opportunistically undermine its mission more than already happens would be catastrophic.

Historically, RO has always been at the crossroads between three major cultural influences:

* Central (and even Western) Europe from the West
* The Balkan Peninsula from the South (Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, Albania - the whole ninety nine yards)
* Russia / Ukraine from the East (with occasional incursions by the Tartars every once in a while, for good measure)

Add to that the fact that the language is actually derived from Latin (it's in the same group with Italian, French, Spanish and Portuguese - the Romance languages) while the main religion is Eastern (Orthodox) Christianity.

So, basically, it's one of the most heterogeneous European cultures, even by balkanic standards. :) Don't be surprised when you see there all sorts of influences in terms of customs, music, language, culture in general.

OTOH, the language is surprisingly uniform across the entire territory (barring small regional differences) and the sense of national identity is strong, at least among the ~ 90% of the population who ethnically identify themselves as ""romanians"" - this despite the fact that the romanian state is a relatively recent creation, only 100 years old (historically, for hundreds of years, there were three kingdoms or principalities splitting the territory more or less equally - and a bunch of tiny communities for thousands of years before that, etc.).

Клуб будет открыт для посещений в период школьных каникул, то есть с начала июня до начала сентября. Занятия в клубе предполагается проводить ежедневно, без выходных, с 10:00 до 18:00. С 12:45 до 14:30 установлен перерыв на обед и послеобеденный отдых. Родителям предоставляется право выбора наиболее приемлемого для детей режима посещений: привести ребят в клуб можно на 2,5 часа в первой половине дня, на 3,5 часа в послеобеденное время, или на полный день — в этом случае пребывание в клубе составит 6 часов. Программы, разработанные клубом, рассчитаны на две возрастные группы: от 4 до 7 лет и от 8 до 12 лет. В программах предусмотрены разнообразные турниры, конкурсы и другие виды состязаний, развивающие творческую активность, оздоровляющие игры на свежем воздухе и театрализованные представления в игровых комнатах отеля, дискотеки и водные аттракционы, среди которых центральное место занимает водная горка длиной 93 м. Для гостей клуба работниками ресторанного комплекса разрабатывается специальное детское меню. Мини-клуб ОЛИМП поможет разнообразить каждый из дней отдыха в Греции с детьми, сделав пребывание в Пелопоннесе увлекательным и незабываемым.

from wiki: 
Dutch gun law is typical of the Western European approach. Firearm possession is not subject to any constitutional protections, but regulated simply in the Arms and Ammunition Act (Wet Wapens en Munitie). Weapons, including firearms, are divided into four categories, and for each of the categories a certain maximum punishment is set for ""voorhanden hebben"" (possession), and ""dragen"" (carrying in public).

Only citizens who are hunters, members of shooting sports clubs or legitimate collectors may obtain licenses for firearms. In the case of shooting club members they will get a license for category III weapons (a firearms category which includes all non- full automatic firearms up to .50 cal.). Possession is generally limited to 5 firearms per license. Collectors may obtain a license for any category of firearm, including full automatic arms, but stringent rules apply to achieving collector status. There is no limit to the number of firearms a collector may obtain. Generally the collector license does not cover shooting these weapons.

Sale/Use is only for those age 18 or over. There are a few dozen gunshops in the Netherlands. Gun ownership is extremely low with only three firearms per hundred people.

Antique firearms are exempt from regulation, antique generally meaning all pre 1945 original muzzle loading firearms or firearms designed for black powder cartridges over .22 caliber, NOT being revolvers.

Employers should be required to demonstrate that their employees are legal to work and should be audited if there are indications to the contrary. Same for renters &amp; tenants, or DMVs issuing IDs.  And if this results in discovering undocumented immigrants, then appropriate consequences (including deportation) should follow promptly and in accordance with due process.

What I *do not* support is giving law enforcement an on-the-books excuse to harass individuals who are not engaged in any activity whatsoever other than ""looking foreign.""

I'm not saying that there will be a coordinated effort or a conspiracy: Just that a few racist assholes who happen to be police officers will use the law as an excuse for voter suppression.

&gt;Good thing we have a Constitutional amendment to serve as a bulwark against reactionaries who panic the moment they see a simple chart

My opinions about gun ownership were not formed on the basis of this graph. In fact I think this particular graph is not the best possible graph for making an argument against gun proliferation.

I never said pandemic or panic-worthy. Those are your words. Of course there are other things society can worry about, but this thread was about guns.

&gt;What are you going to do when you make guns illegal

Where did I say they should be made illegal?

&gt;and the millions and millions and MILLIONS of guns out there go into the black market?

I don't think making guns illegal would increase the number of illegal guns.

&gt;How are you going to defend your family, yourself, your property?

From what? I don't live in Bosnia. Even if I have a gun I can't fight off a gang of armed criminals who want to shoot me to take my TV and my wallet. I am quite capable of protecting my property with an alarm system and security gates and a phone to call the police. Why on Earth would I want to shoot someone who was trying to steal my television?

&gt;I prefer taking actions into my own hands, and taking my defense into my own hands.

You can protect yourself in your home without a gun. Besides, criminals generally do not shoot people without guns who are cooperative.

&gt;The police do not respond in time. This is harsh fact.

That sounds like something you should take up with your representative. I think US police response times are probably pretty good in global terms.

&gt;If you want to be scared for your life, and scared of burglaries and violent criminals, get rid of your guns.

I'm not scared. If someone breaks into my home to steal my TV, I will phone the cops and stay behind my security gates. Why do you think a burglar would want to shoot unarmed people? He wants your stuff, not to kill you. Besides, you probably cannot win a gunfight against a gang of armed burglars anyway. You make it sounds as if there are gangs trying to break into your house every day and you are forced to open fire on them to make them go away. Have you actually ever shot someone? Have you ever seen a criminal shoot someone?

&gt;Everyone owns guns around here. Our crime rates in our neighborhoods are very, very low.

More guns around means more guns for criminals to steal.

&gt;I never hear of robberies, ever.

Me neither, and yet no one around here has a gun. I don't know a single person who owns a gun.

&gt;The drug war is the cause of most of this nonsense, sir.

Why does it have to be absolute? Surely if we could get rid of even half of guns, we would see a decrease in gun-related deaths. That is pretty much what this graph is telling us. Fewer guns = fewer gun-related deaths. We don't need to get rid of every single gun on the entire planet in order to have a positive effect.

,1,"You still need to put all of this in context.

Israel is a democracy, and aligned with Western nations.  And unlike, just as an example, the situation in Sudan, the populations of Europe and America can actually pressure (or feel that they can pressure) the Israeli government through non-violent means (diplomacy, protests, media attention, etc.)

In Sudan (Darfur), since it's a civil war and it's between factions from within the country, it is very hard to pressure the government (or what's left of it) to stop the conflict.  In that case, response from the West has been direct military intervention (through UN peacekeeping missions). Response from populations of the world has been mostly in the form of direct humanitarian aid (and protests/demonstrations a while ago). Many charities now cooperate with the UN in order to  bring aid to people in Darfur. There's no ""outcry"" because that would be pointless (diplomatic pressure on rebels is mostly futile).  But there are still campaigns going on here and there to convince people to send help.

I think the current outcry shows how people respect Israel and expect a lot more from the nation.  For NK, it's the usual SNAFU (Situation Normal: All Fucked Up).  It's hard to feel like you can change anything with a dictatorship (without risking full-out war).

There's also the fact that U.S. aid to Israel is mostly in the form of weapons, and taxpayers have a right to be frustrated with the situation.  Also the fact that many neighboring countries are hostile to Israel, and the media organizations catering to them will never put Israel in a good light.  Depending on where you get your news, you might be inundated with anti-Israel news right now, which might add to your perception that people are singling out the country because of its Jewish heritage.

But overall, I think it's far too complex a situation to narrow it down to Jews vs non-Jews.

,0,"&gt;Have you ever been shot at or even had a gun pointed at you?

Yes. I grew up in South Africa. Although I don't think anecdotal evidence should really form the basis of discussions like this, I can't disguise that my anti-gun stance is largely motivated by my experiences with gun crime.

I don't want this to turn into a dick measuring contest about who has been the victim of more crime or something like that, but I have seen people get shot dead just so someone could steal a cellphone and a wallet. I have been mugged many times but every time I was calm and cooperative and lucky enough to get away without being hurt.

I have also woken up inside my own home with a gun in my face. In all the situations where I have been robbed there was never a chance for me to use a gun even if I had owned one. That is why I think their usefulness in self defence is vastly overstated. I think carrying a gun is going to make it even more likely that a criminal will shoot you.

&gt;There will always be guns in existence.

Probably. However, in the UK there are very few guns around. Sure they sometimes get used in crimes but in general the crime here is nonviolent or you might get stabbed in the worst case scenario. There are hardly any gun murders in muggings or robberies.

&gt;Organized crime (the only statistically significant users of criminal firearms) will see to it. Criminals run their own import/export businesses. Most firearms used in Canadian gun crime were illegally imported firearms.

Well I am not worried about the use of firearms by organised crime. They don't want my wallet or my TV. I don't see why anyone besides law enforcement needs firearms to deal with organised crime.

&gt;Also in Canada, where handguns are quite easy to legally obtain, most violent crime is committed with knives and related non-gun instruments

I don't know enough about Canadian gun law to really comment. Maybe they have much harsher sentences for gun-related crime?

&gt;But why should the police be armed and not the rest of the population?

They shouldn't. As long as the police need to carry guns, then it must be legal for the public to have them. I don't want to force the public not to have guns. I want to change the perception that they are actually useful in self defence.

&gt;If you don't have a gun, you can still be a threat very easily. A street thug will rob you of your phone and wallet, stab you a couple of times and kick you in the face if you aren't prepared to defend yourself.

In my experience that is not true. They don't want to make trouble for themselves. Getting caught after mugging someone is minor. Getting caught for stabbing someone who died is much more serious. Generally I think it is immensely stupid to try to fight back against an armed attacker if all they want is your wallet and phone. My life is worth much more to me than all the wallets and phones on the planet.

&gt;A criminal with a gun is likely to not shoot you ""just for kicks"" because it makes too much noise and ammunition is harder to come by than another knife.

Sure. That is why I don't think you need a gun. He probably won't shoot you anyway. If he is going to shoot you, your having a gun won't change his mind. However, if he wasn't going to shoot you but he sees you have a gun, he might change his mind and shoot you because you are a threat.

&gt;Seems like you haven't really had to deal with dangerous neighbourhoods and the types of situations that can occur in a thug-ridden urban environment.

As I said. I grew up in Johannesburg in South Africa. While I don't think this argument should be based on anecdotal evidence I also don't want you to assume that I am some American brat from the suburbs who has never stared down the barrel of a gun.

&gt;A compelling reason to own a firearm for home defense is not because you can kill people, or even shoot at them. 9 idiots out of 10 will run at the sight of a gun or the sound of a gun cocking.

Unless they have a gun, of course. In that case they shoot you.

&gt;If you were woken up in the middle of the night by 6 16ish year old kids kicking in your window and swarming your house, running up the stairs, raping your wife and young daughter in front of you while two of them stabbed and beat you senseless, you'd wish you'd owned a firearm. You'd wish for it even more if the police took 45 minutes to respond because they ""know it's a bad area.""

Security gates? Burglar bars? Alarm system? All of these things allow you to protect yourself. Besides, if six people enter your house with the intention of killing you and raping your wife, there is still a good chance having a gun won't help.

I also don't think it is a very realistic example. Most burglars don't want to kill you and rape your wife. They want you valuable possessions.

&gt;I've been a responsible firearms owner for year. I was taught how to safely and responsibly handle firearms since I was about 8 years old.

Of course people like you aren't the problem. If all firearms users were responsible then it wouldn't be a problem. Unfortunately there are lots of irresponsible firearms users.

&gt;Never once have I heard of someone using their legal firearms for illegal purpose except for one careless fellow who really shouldn't have owned guns in the first place and only hurt himself.

Generally they get stolen and then used in criminal activities.

&gt;Diligent Licensing and training is the answer to gun violence. Not banning guns.

Heh, well you were lucky it was already on my DVR and nothing was on TV... I still have a DVD somebody sent me to watch a year ago that I haven't gotten around to

&gt;You're right that it's a trendy direction style, but I'm a fan because it gets things done.

Well it gets the narrative job done, but it doesn't do much for atmosphere. If we compared this to song production, it would like removing the extra nuances of a recording that make the song a bit longer in favor of cutting the song down to 3 minutes because that's better for radio play.

&gt;His sadness is obvious because he thinks its expression is profound, because it's what he's valued for by others

I can see that being a possibility, but honestly I think you're grasping at straws. Considering the general tone of the film (and the fact that Being John Malkovich is the same way), I think it's more likely that Kaufman thinks this style of characterization is effective (in a non-ironic way).  The monologue at the end of the film (which wasn't even created by Phillip's character, it was done by Diane Wiest's character) seems to say that everybody is miserable which would mean that Phillip's character doesn't think it's profound at all (or at least not because it's simply him mentally masturbating).

And since the entire film is a not-so-subtle meta-reference to Charlie and his real life, I'm not so sure if he feels that the messages in his film are trite. There's an interview of him where explains why he doesn't make films where characters find comfort in God. He basically says he doesn't make those films for the same reason he doesn't make films about lumberjacks... he doesn't relate or have interest in that which infers that he relates with that POV in S:NY (not to mention the fact that again, the protag in that film is basically Charlie). He makes this point even more obvious when Phillip's character twice points out that the audience should get the meta-reference that a sad actor playing a sad actor is going to meet the same fate as the character (i.e., the film is saying that Charlie Koffman will have the same fate as Phillip's character).

I think the other problem you mention about exaggeration is that he already uses surreal exaggeration on top of things that are not. In other words, unless it's really obvious (like the weird therapist or the actor struggling to just walk correctly), the lousy characterization is actually not meant to be lousy or ironic. In fact, the real exaggerations come when we see things like his daughter growing up quickly or when his friend buys a house that's on fire or when he projects himself onto the characters on his television.

Of course the problem with blatantly obvious meta-reference films is that all of the weaknesses in them can easily be explained as being, ""on purpose... that's the point!"" I'm not saying that this makes the explanation inaccurate, but it does make criticism unfair since the artist can simply hide behind that. But again, Malkovich had a similar tone and it wasn't a meta-reference film which leads me to believe that the weaknesses I'm pointing out are more likely real than purposeful.

What's also strange is that if the whole thing is him making fun of these trite statements, then the film really fails to say anything at all.

&gt;Can you suggest some foreign ones for me? I can't promise the turn around you did, but I can promise I'll give them a shot. Thanks for discussing this with me!

I can, but I'm not sure where to start. The best films came from Europe in the 60's so that's a good place to start. Have you seen films by Bergman, Antonioni, Resnais, Godard, Tarkovsky or Fellini? If so, tell me which. If not, I'll name something.

Werner Herzog's films from the 70's were also top notch (films like Grizzly Man, Rescue Dawn and perhaps Bad Lietenant are good, but they're not even close to the stuff he did in his early days).

Again, who said we should ban guns outright? It has to be a process. We have to decrease the number of guns around over time, not make it illegal for law abiding citizens to have them without affecting the number of guns in criminal hands. However, as Western Europe clearly shows: a decrease in the number of firearms in households leads to less gun-related violence. This means that fewer guns in households _must_ lead to fewer guns in the hands of criminals over time.

&gt;We can outlaw violent crimes and the means to commit those violent crimes as much as we want, but until we understand the desire to commit those crimes we don't have a real chance at curbing the behavior.

I don't think that is true. Guns make it very easy to commit violent crime. Fewer guns means that it becomes more difficult and dangerous for criminals to commit violent crimes.

I do concede the point that the US and the Western world has, theoretically, more pull with Israel than they do in the DPRK or Sudan.

On each occasion, there has been all manner of international outcry but nothing ends up happening.

,1,"&gt;And since the entire film is a not-so-subtle meta-reference to Charlie and his real life, I'm not so sure if he feels that the messages in his film are trite.

I suspected this until the scene where the man playing the preacher literally preaches themes.  I took that as an assurance that the themes were tongue-in-cheek.

I'm not sure if I buy too much of a Caden/Charlie equivocation.  Obviously they're both writer-directors, but beyond that Caden seems like too much of a character.  Caden did explicitly mention meta-actor fate, but Caden wasn't an actor, and his meta-actor was the one to succumb to kill himself.

&gt;the lousy characterization is actually not meant to be lousy or ironic.

I took the obvious bad characterization to be a hint that the audience should be more suspicious about unnatural characterization in the rest of the film.  I didn't think it was meant to be ironic, just filtered through Caden's perception of other characters/himself.  Other good extreme examples are his first wife's ""little paintings,"" his second wife's gigantic, horrible tattoo, and that his daughter's tattoos literally wilted upon her death.

&gt;it does make criticism unfair since the artist can simply hide behind that.

I don't think it makes things unfair, it just paints an easy characterization target for other characters and a more complex one for Caden.  It's a bit unfair because of the lessened scope of necessary characterization, I suppose.

&gt;Malkovich had a similar tone and it wasn't a meta-reference film

That is an excellent observation, but I don't know if I'm sold yet.  Malkovich didn't have hints about unreliable narrator the way S:NY did.  I completely understand your position though, it is rather astute.

&gt;if the whole thing is him making fun of these trite statements, then the film really fails to say anything at all.

I'm great with that!  But this may boil down to my having a closer existential paradigm to Kaufman than some.  The movie was fun and challenging, and then it was over.  I'm more than happy with that much meaning to my existence.

As such Israel should face greater scrutiny and, given it is a democracy, scrutiny and international pressure is more likely to work in resolving the issue (rather than resorting to sanctions or military action).

I also probably wouldn't put Turkey in the same category as Israel, Iran or many other nations, mainly because of the efforts Turkey has made (in pursuing EU membership) in correcting it's behaviour and because, frankly, it's actions pale in comparison with those of Israel and others both in terms of scale and their nature.

The Autochrome Colour Photography Process was invented 1903, and first marketed in 1907.
The complicated and very expensive process resulted in a big, transparent glass slide called an ['Autochrome'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autochrome).

..It seems this particular picture is not well known yet, i found it on flickr, recently uploaded by [richard sullivan](http://www.flickr.com/photos/richard_sullivan/), the actual picture was supposedly taken by [Alvin Langdon Coburn](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Langdon_Coburn).

More Autochromes are in this [flickr group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/703767@N21/).

The most notable person associated with early colour photography is [Albert Kahn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Kahn_%28banker%29). Beeing superrich and philanthropic, he sent out photographers to
travel the globe and create a colour photographic record of human life on Earth, ""Archives de la Planète"". About 72,000 colour plates where created between 1909 and 1930, some of these even where stereoscopic. Then, Black Friday and the following Great Depression ruined him and put an end to his project.  
his estate, and all his belongings later where seized and became [a museum](http://www.albert-kahn.fr/english/).

i first learned about this by the wonderfull BBC series about Albert Kahn's incredible legacy.
looking in the livelike faces of people from one hundred years ago is incredible.
There is [a book](http://www.albertkahn.co.uk/europe.html) and [another book](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8718.html) and [a dvd](http://bioscopic.wordpress.com/2009/09/11/albert-kahn-at-last-on-dvd/).

Not Jewish- just pointing out the fact that this, although not necessarily on this board, is sure to lead to antisemitic justifications...mostly because the paradigm already has strong roots within the western mindset.

,4,"Muslims became extremely rich and started living the high life. They got drunk on their excesses and lost any hunger/thirst for knowledge. It's sort of what you see happening in some circles of American society today. Popular culture values wealth, ignorance, lavish lifestyles, and entertainment. And devalues knowledge.

While scientific advancements stopped, engineering advances (in the military sector) continued right into the 19th century. The Ottomans and Mughals helped pioneer the use of cannons and missiles/rockets. The British copied the design for their rockets from Tipu Sultan in India, which were then used on the United States in the War of 1812 (""the rockets' red glare...""). The use of cannons were instrumental in the Ottomans' conquest of Constantinople and subsequent romp through Eastern Europe. There are fascinating YouTube clips from documentaries on the History Channel and others showing a glimpse of Mughal culture and their technological innovations.

Of course that wasn't enough. India couldn't offer a united front against Western colonial powers and soon the Mughals lost to the Brits and the Sikhs followed suit in the mid-19th century.

The Ottomans slowly lost ground despite rapid reforms which kept their military up to date with Western standards (a few British naval officers served in the Ottoman Navy at one point). What finally got them was being unable to keep up with the free market economies of Western Europe (powered by colonies abroad) and the betrayal of the Arabs in the Mideast. Despite that, they went out in World War 1 by holding their own during the Gallipolli Campaign where they inflicted massive losses on Allied invading forces, mostly British, NZ, Aussie. Hundreds of thousands dead.

The last century (the 19th) of Westernization had its own side effects. It bred de-religiousified Ottomans. Take a military-religious imperial tradition, remove the imperial and the religious and you get a strongly nationalistic/ethnocentric military-focused culture that is modern day Turkey. Founded by one of the leading Generals of the Gallipolli Campaign. He deposed the last Caliph, sent him into exile, and disbanded the Caliphate.

Then the Muslim world started following Turkey's lead. Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Saudi-Arabia, all were united behind their respective flavors of nationalism and were on the fast track to liberalism until the creation of Israel, a Jewish state (Jewish... in a time when everyone was trumpeting secularism) and the subsequent decades of unconditional support from the world's leading example of Western democratic tradition, the United States. This was exacerbated by meddling in their affairs by the CIA and the US, who overthrew elected governments and installed dictators. Muslim rulers then entrenched themselves, keeping their people suppressed while simultaneously using their anger as leverage to retain relevancy in the eyes of the world's secret power brokers, the US and the CIA.

After all this, the Muslim version of the Tea Party came out of the woodwork and started training people to blow themselves up after seeing it work for the Japanese and Sri Lankans.

After all that. And yet in America, the Christian Tea Party is already in full swing before America's even gotten too far in its decline. As bad as the Muslim world became, all indications are when the US goes down, things will be much, much, worse.

,1,"Hmm... Social Market Economy is a post-war concept, that makes comparison difficult. But let's try anyway.

Luckily, there's some good data available [here](http://www.measuringworth.org/usgdp/). I'll take 1928 as the last pre-Great Depression year as the end of the period, not the New Deal. I hope you appreciate this.

Real per capita GDP (in 2005 dollars) of the US in 1928 was $7,645. Half of that is $3,823, the closest year to that is 1880, with $3,816. This means that it took 48 to double.

FDR became president in 1933 and the New Deal was enacted the same year, in the middle of the Great Depression. The figure for 1933 is $8,188, the nearest double is $16,466 in 1962, only 29 years later. Now, this includes a decent chunk of the Great Depression and all of WW2, so maybe it's not the best reference period. Let's look at the period before the current crisis instead, going back from $43,425 in 2006. Nearest to half of this a little bit closer to 1972, but I'll take the $21,249 in 1971 anyway -- still only 35 years.

OK, maybe going back to 1880 is a bit much. Let's find out what the closest year to 75% real GDP per capita of our reference years is instead. For 2006, this causes a bit of a problem. It could be 1993, with $32,747. Or it could be $32,112 in 1990, before it dropped to $31,614 in the following year. So, 13-16 years.

For the pre-FDR reference year of 1928, we face a similar problem. The closest match is $5,739 in 1901 (only $5 over), the alternative would be $5,656 in 1904. That's 14-17 years, a comparable result.

We could try the same with the period beginning in, say, $13,225 in 1950. That's five years after WW2. For 100% growth we end up at $26,010 in 1979, 29 years later, easily beating the 48. The result for our other measure would be $17,675 in 1964, or 14 years, which is at the low end of the other result.

Of course, there are a number of problems with this. The moving assembly line was only introduced in 1913, and the figures are mudded by the First World War. During the modern period, women entered the work force in increasing numbers, which is an advantage for the post-WW2 figures.

Still, I interpret this as supporting my thesis that it doesn't make much of a difference. And with or without the New Deal and later social policies, what the US has is still a far way from what we have in Europe. [Taxes as a share of GDP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_as_percentage_of_GDP) are only 28.2%. For Germany it's 40.6%, France has 46.1%, Sweden 49.7% and Denmark even 50.0%. The regulation and social programs don't appear to affect economic growth all that much.

I didn't say anything about gun control laws at all.

&gt;It seems blindingly obvious to me that there is a direct correlation between the number of a guns citizens have and laws restricting the number of guns citizens can have.

This graph doesn't measure number of guns per household. It measures percentage of households with firearms.

&gt;But if you use laws to take guns out of the hands of citizens, like Mexico has done with some of the toughest in the world, then your left with an unarmed society that can not defend themselves against thugs with guns. And such is the situation in Mexico and Russia.

Do you think Mexico and Russia are good for socio-economic comparison purposes with the USA? I think they are vastly different societies with many differences we cannot really control for. If you want to know if this effect is real, why not consider the Western European countries on this graph? They are far more similar socio-economically and yet the effect is still present.

&gt;Taking 100% of the guns out of a country is a fantasy - because you can't get guns out of the criminals hands.

I don't think anyone really believes you can get rid of guns 100%. We just want to decrease the number of guns.

,1,"Your knowledge of Israeli history seems to be what's flawed here, so I'll try to be nice and go through this with you in a civil manner.

&gt;True, but Palestinians have been attacking Jews in the region from before there was an Israel.

I recommend you read some Israeli history books. Perhaps Ilan Pappe's [The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine](http://www.amazon.com/Ethnic-Cleansing-Palestine-Ilan-Pappe/dp/1851685553/ref=bfac-20/183-7249894-1074157?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1275582296&amp;sr=8-1), or Noam Chomsky's [Fateful Triangle](http://www.amazon.com/Fateful-Triangle-Palestinians-Updated-Classics/dp/0896086011/ref=bfac-20?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1275582316&amp;sr=1-1) or any number of books.

Yes, the Palestinians did attack Jews before the creation of Israel. But you're omitting the tiny little fact that the Jews were arriving en masse from Europe and Russia with the intent to create their own state.

&gt;“The aim of the [Jewish National] Fund was ‘to redeem the land of Palestine as the inalienable possession of the Jewish people.’...
&gt;As early as 1891, Zionist leader Ahad Ha’am wrote that the Arabs “understood very well what we were doing and what we were aiming at’...
&gt;[Theodore Herzl, the founder of Zionism, stated]:
&gt; ‘We shall try to spirit the penniless [Arab] population across the border by procuring employment for it in transit countries, while denying it employment in our own country... Both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly’...
&gt;At various locations in northern Palestine Arab farmers refused to move from land the Fund purchased from absentee owners, and the Turkish authorities, at the Fund’s request, evicted them...The indigenous Jews of Palestine also reacted negatively to Zionism. They did not see the need for a Jewish state in Palestine and did not want to exacerbate relations with the Arabs.” 
John Quigley, “Palestine and Israel: A Challenge to Justice.”

Secondly, why are you omitting Jewish attacks on Palestinians??
Haven't you ever heard of the [Irgun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irgun)? Or the [Hagana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagana)? Or [LEHI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehi_%28group%29)?
To say ""the palestinians attacked Jews before Israel was created"" is an utter and absolute misrepresentation of history. There were attacks on both sides, and the Zionists were intent on driving out the Palestinians. 

If Mexicans move en masse to Canada tomorrow, with the intention of creating a Mexican homeland in Quebec, then the Quebecers will **obviously** fight them.

So the fact that you mention how Palestinians attacked Jews and not that both attacked each other is either a sign of brainwashing by a media that keeps repeating it, or a lack of knowledge of the history, or simply a racist outlook whereby Palestinian lives don't mean as much as Jewish ones.


&gt;“Serfs they (the Jews) were in the lands of the Diaspora, and suddenly they find themselves in freedom [in Palestine]; and this change has awakened in them an inclination to despotism. 
&gt;They treat the Arabs with hostility and cruelty, deprive them of their rights, offend them without cause, and even boast of these deeds; and nobody among us opposes this despicable and dangerous inclination.” 
Zionist writer Ahad Ha’am, quoted in Sami Hadawi, “Bitter Harvest.”

Lastly, David Ben-Gurion, the 1st Prime Minister of Israel had this to say:

&gt;‘in our political argument abroad, we minimize Arab opposition to us,’ but he urged, ‘let us not ignore the truth among ourselves.’ 
&gt;The truth was that **‘politically we are the aggressors and they defend themselves... The country is theirs, because they inhabit it, whereas we want to come here and settle down, and in their view we want to take away from them their country, while we are still outside’**
Quoted from Noam Chomsky 'Fateful Triangle'

So again. Why do you insist on repeating ""but Palestinians have been attacking Jews in the region from before there was an Israel""

Israel is occupying their land. They have a right to resist as you agreed. I'm not saying it's the right way, but it is pure and utter irrationality to demand a country to stop resisting when another country occupies it. Nobody on earth questioned the Finns when they resisted the Soviets. No one on earth questioned the South Koreans when they resisted the North Koreans. If Israel went back to it's 1967 borders, and Hamas was STILL firing rockets, THEN you would have a right to argue that.




&gt;why should Israel accept the constant judgments against them

a) Because they do terrible illegal things
b) Because Israel is a signatory of the UN charter - so it must abide by them.

&gt;Despite the fact that Palestinians were the ones who dissolved the UN solution in 1948, and when Israel won, they offered amnesty, equality and repatriation so families wouldn't be split. 

Again, either you are lying, or you don't know what you're talking about. 

“Arab rejection was...based on the fact that, while the population of the Jewish state was to be [only half] Jewish with the Jews owning less than 10% of the Jewish state land area, the Jews were to be established as the ruling body — a settlement which no self-respecting people would accept without protest, to say the least...The action of the United Nations conflicted with the basic principles for which the world organization was established, namely, to uphold the right of all peoples to self-determination. By denying the Palestine Arabs, who formed the two-thirds majority of the country, the right to decide for themselves, the United Nations had violated its own charter.” 
Sami Hadawi, “Bitter Harvest.”



&gt;Back to a previous point. You said that it was wrong because it was illegal. Legality is measure of society's acceptance of a behavior. 

No. What kind of a statement is that??

Somalians accept piracy because they have a non-functioning government. So by your logic of ""society's acceptance of a behaviour"" Somalia can argue that they are perfectly in the right when they pirate ships.
Of course, this is  untrue, because as any human being imbued with logic can tell you, piracy is illegal by international standards.

So Israel can feel hurt and betrayed all it wants - but it still can't attack foreign ships in international waters just because they think their society's acceptance of a behaviour is the only thing that matters.
Your view has such a stench of inherent racism it's absurd.

What about what Palestinian society? Did you even consider them when writing that absurd sentence?
If they accept suicide bombing, then by your ridiculous logic we can say that despite the UN condeming it, they are free to do so!

They might be rare, but I bet they're out there. I'd suggest looking at startups rather than big companies. Look for a company that has &lt;20 employees. They might not pay as much and there is some risk that the company will flounder. In return, you'll typically get more say in what goes on, since the org-chart is significantly flatter. Startups tend to be more cutting edge with technology and environments, since they need every advantage over established companies that they can get. Big companies are all about limiting risk, whereas startups already have an inherent amount of risk associated, so it makes sense to push the envelope. 

Even in the US, you can still find work that sounds a lot like what you describe. In fact, I'd imagine that's the norm for corporations that aren't focused on development.

First, I simply don't believe you when you say that ""we"" (ie you) want to find the truth behind the ""Armenian incident"".

,5,"I thought Stewart's commentary was predictable and within the confines of the status quo narrative. Why? 

1. Because most of the time he just recapitulated the idea that the axis of evil folks (arabs, iranians, and north koreans) may just ""annihilate us all together"", saying, ""teetering on the brink of war, that's your thing (middle east)"". Don't mind the fact that the US has been the most blood thirsty country, far more than any country in the middle east, we've seen this decade - especially in the middle east. In fact, by far most of the death we see in the middle east this decade is a direct result of American (i.e. white people, European, whatever) aggression. So, what we can expect from Jon Stewart is a lack of perspective, a lack that does not account the purview from which he judges these world events.

2. He says, ""Try almost 6,000 years [of war]"" as if the arab-israeli conflict is this sort of never-ending conundrum resulting from what Stewart calls ""religious strife"". It is this defeatist attitude that keeps American criticism of Israel at bay. Simply, it's just a huge ""clusterfuck in the middle east""... oh what irrational war-mongering people they are.. Nevermind the fact that muslims haven't even been around for 6,000 years!! Stewart, alas, here, is a tool of the dominant dumb-fat-American narrative. Or, he is unwilling to question it. 

3. He says, ""so this story is ultimately a very complex he said she said..."" as if all we have are two sides arguing, with no actual facts and laws to touch base on. Once again, this is another rhetorical tool used to make it seem that this is just one ultimately never-ending war based on prejudices and finger-pointing, as if concrete and actual moral transgressions never occurred by Israel or Palestinian political organizations. This keeps Stewart from actually honing in on and pinning down on Israel for its immoral violence.

4. Lastly, he asks, ""What was the world's response?"" only then to show various pictures of flag burning. Alternatively, he could have mentioned the International denunciation of Israel's latest transgressions, he could have mentioned the Israeli ambassadors kicked out of countries, he could have mentioned the U.N. chief's remarks. He could have mentioned the increased isolation of the U.S. and Israel that has resulted from this violence. But, no! Stewart has a narrative to sell, and the narrative is one of war-mongering arabs and Jewish people duking it out until the Apocalypse.

With that in mind, I suggest that a subtle and honed in reading of Stewart will continue to show that his commentary more often than not falls short of insightful time and time again. Indeed, he often perpetuates the very racist stereotypes against folks from the middle east that one would think he would avoid. Instead, I believe we should see Stewart as an ideologue that plays this role of leveling discourse into this left-vs.-right binary. He is simply unable to see beyond these two options. In turn, he is unable to truly come through with insight and more often than not perpetuates the status quo political dualisms.",politics,0,0,True,5,1426330309,False,frenlaven,,c0rd10b,False,0,t5_2cneq,1275610093,,t1_c0rd10b,t3_cb1di,t3_cb1di

,1,"&gt;though, to be fair, they are no longer occupying Gaza

Though, to be fair, they've had a blockade on Gaza since 2000.

According to the UN, there was a humanitarian crisis in Gaza due to this blockade already in 2003 - 3 years **before** Hamas was elected.


&gt;I have been unable to find any resolution or anything else officially calling the blockade, and specifically the naval blockade illegal.

They don't need to make a resolution to say it's illegal. The definition of a legal blockade is if the UN Security Council approves it, so by definition, this blockade is illegal.

Most European countries, and the UN Sec. General have called for it to be ended immediately and condemned it. See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_blockade#United_Nations)

So why should they pass a resolution if it's already illegal?

To give you an analogy, say your friend is murdered.
The US congress doesn't meet to discuss whether your friends murder was legal or not - because the definition of murder according to the law is illegal - so that specific case doesn't need to be addressed on its own, otherwise the UN would have to meet to discuss every fictitious or ridiculous blockade all over the world. The point is - if the UN didn't establish it - it's illegal.


&gt;Also, in regards to Resolution 242, the UNSC acknowledged that Israel is occupying Palestinian land, but the premise of the resolution is ""land for peace"" in which Israel returns the land in return for a lasting peace. Israel did unilaterally leave Gaza and the result was rocket attacks.

I'll address this in 2 parts.

1) Israel left Gaza ONLY - not the land it was supposed to leave according to Resolution 242. Till this day it hasn't left the land it was supposed to - in fact, it's only going deeper and deeper into the West Bank. For ideological reasons and for resources such as the water of the river Jordan.

2) &gt;Israel did unilaterally leave Gaza and the result was rocket attacks.

Not entirely true. Israel left Gaza in 2005 - BUT, as I said above, there was a blockade on Gaza since 2000 that wasn't lifted. Israel maintained control of Gaza's borders, and there was a  humanitarian crisis in Gaza according to the UN 3 years before Hamas was even elected. 

According to the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), in January 2003

'(T)he Israeli **blockade** and closures over the past two years had pushed the Palestinian economy into such a
stage of ‘de-development’ that as much as US $2.4 billion had been drained out of the economy of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip’[9]

Taken from [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_blockade)

This statement is from 2003, so you can see clearly that Israel was strangling Gaza to death looong before Hamas ever rolled in, and 2 years before it ""left"" the Gaza strip.

Now, when Hamas won the election in 2006, they demanded Israel to lift the blockade. Israel refused, and thus they took the hardnosed approach of firing rockets.

&gt;Oh yeah, you never addressed Article 51 where Israel gets to do what it needs to do defend itself until the UN takes adequate action.

But Israel is **in violation** of the UN. Israel isn't defending itself, that's what you're not getting - it's **maintaining an occupation.**

Like I said before, if Mexico invaded Canada tomorrow, and the UN passed a resolution stating that Mexico must draw back from occupied Canadian land **immediately**, Mexico cannot say ""we will draw back as soon as the Canadians stop attacking us!""

Can't you see how inherently and absolutely illogical that is??


&gt;So, to recap: 1) Arab states occupied Palestinian land for nearly 20 years before Israel 2) Israel is not occupying Gaza 3) Israel has the right to defend itself according to the UN Charter until the UN resolves the situation. (so does Palestine)

1. Egypt attacked Israel to stop Palestine from being partitioned. When they gave up that dream they drew back from Gaza, simple as that. The Palestinian fighters were allied with the Egyptians and Jordanians and never saw them as occupiers, mainly because they're fellow Arabs. They never fought nor denounced that brief period of occupation. After the failed attempts, the Palestinians were left to fend off Israel by themselves.

2. Israel **is** occupying Gaza. They never lifted the blockade, utterly destroying the Gazan economy. How can you say they left Gaza when they retained control of its borders and stopped anything from coming in or out?? That's why experts call it an 'open-air prison'.

3. Sure, Israel DOES have the right to defend itself. But the UN **already resolved** the situation back in 1967. Israel is occupying Palestine, so what does it have to defend?? The Palestinians have occupiers on their land, surely that means they can resist?


&gt;Parting shot: Egypt is a full and willing participant in the Gaza blockade, but it's so much more fun to make Israel the only bad guy in conflict that the entire region is responsible for (plus the US and the British).

That's not true. I haven't mentioned Egypt simply because I don't consider Egypt to even be worth discussing.

Egypt is an utter, 100% dictatorship. It has had the same puppet in power since the 70s. Every humanitarian organization you can think of have said that the Egyptian government tortures and murders its citizens. It is one of the most controlled societies on earth.
Even bloggers are imprisoned and tortured in Egypt.

I know this because I lived there.

Secondly, Egypt is one of the most riotous countries on earth. Riots are so routine they are a part of everyday life. The army cracks down on them, beats them, tortures them.

Thirdly, Egypt is the 2nd largest recipient of US military and financial aid after Israel - why? To keep up it's peace treaty with Israel, which about 0% of the country wants.

Also, Mubarak murdered and destroyed all political opposition. The only group he wasn't strong enough to take down was the Muslim Brotherhood, because they've existed long before he came into power. That is why you only have 1 legitimate opposition group against Mubarak: the Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian government has been criticized so many times over its torture and murder of MB members that I won't even bother finding sources.

In effect, Egypt is 100% a client state of the US, and is constantly living on the brink of civil war. Mubarak is about to die soon, and rumor has it he's going to put his son in power. If he does that, there **will** be civil war, I guarantee it.

Mubarak was never elected. He **does not** represent what the population of Egypt want. If you don't believe me, ask any Egyptian you meet. Literally anyone.

2. It wasn't a trojan horse. The photos released by Israel do not show weapons, they show basic tools like knives and axes that can't possibly be effective weapons against Israel. Remember that Israel has not allowed any building materials to enter Gaza.

3. Breaking the blockade does not mean anything violent, it just means they intended to dock in port at Gaza. Remember that the UN and EU have both told Israel that the blockade was causing a humanitarian crisis and needed to end. The flotilla was attempting to relieve some of the crisis.

Described on wikipedia as:
&gt;The New Century Foundation was founded in 1994 as a United States 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization to ""study immigration and race relations so as to better understand the consequences of America’s increasing diversity."" Since 1994 it has received support from the Pioneer Fund and is dedicated to the ideal of the United States as a white European nation. Dinesh D'Souza has described its activities as ""white racism"".[1][2]

&gt;It sponsors publications and books, and has held the biennial American Renaissance Conference since 1994. The organization was founded by Jared Taylor, who is its current president. The group publishes the American Renaissance, a monthly magazine describing itself as ""America's premiere publication of racial-realist thought."" The New Century Foundation has also published a pamphlet The Color of Crime about the relationship between race and crime in the US, discussing in particular higher crime rates amongst blacks and hispanics.[3] The Anti-Defamation League criticized the New Century Foundation for promoting ""genteel racism"" and for employing dubious techniques to claim the superiority of whites and the need for racial purity.[4]

It also publishes a magzine which has featured contributions from the likes of [Nick Griffin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Griffin), [Bruno Gollnisch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Gollnisch), [Samuel T. Francis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_T._Francis), [Paul Fromm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Fromm_%28activist%29) and various other racists and neo nazis.

My uncle was in local politics for a while, really popular and they wanted him to go higher up.  But he couldn't take the bribery and bullshit.  Much of it came from Russians who had moved to Ukraine.  This is where some of the hatred comes from, the rest is a mixture of Russia messing with Ukraine's politics [a la Orange Revolution], the deal with Chechnya, every Russian they have ever known being a wanker and the whole USSR thing [my grandparents on my mothers side met in a Gulag, and there are ties to the Holodomor].

This is where my obviously biased opinion starts.  You're from the East, so we won't agree but I'll throw my 2 cents in anyway.

I think it's bullshit that Russia and Ukraine should be together.  Russia rapes Ukraine over and over again.  Now the Russian puppet that is Yanukovych is trying to get Russian on equal ground with Ukrainian.  Russia is already huge, and it's difficult to maintain any sense of nationality in such a vast territory.

Part of the reason our politics is so messed up is that you have the East being mostly Russians now, wanting to go with Russia and the West wanting to claw independence and get in to the EU.  The East is more populated, so they usually win any power struggles.  At the moment, our relations with Russia couldn't be any stronger.
 
There's lots of corruption and joining with Russia will probably aggravate that, there's even more corruption there.

It's a shitty situation.  The way my family see it, there are a few choices.  West and East split, the East becoming part of Russia.  The younger generations gain awareness and realise that Ukraine is an independent country.  A war starts between the West and East.  

Ukraine and Russia will never, ever be together so long as we live.  ",IAmA,0,0,True,2,1426330451,False,jujuM,,c0rdbzx,False,0,t5_2qzb6,1275619879,,t1_c0rdbzx,t1_c0r9sjz,t3_caj6d

How about we give Africa a break. Over the past couple hundred years European nations went in, took what they wanted, and left without any consideration for the people living there. Is it any wonder that countries with corrupt leaders, starving populations, and some of the deadliest diseases (and a lack of medicine to treat them) are having such a hard time recovering?

Both my parents went on a Mission trip to Swaziland in 2005. Swaziland has one of the largest (if not the largest) percentage of people with AIDs. An incredible number of children are orphaned every year because of this. Many, many kids grow up without anything, or anyone to teach them about the world. 

Do you know what my parents taught the people over there? They taught them how to farm. Humans have been farming ever since the Neolithic Revolution 10,000 years ago, yet these people had had no one to teach them how to farm, and therefore had no livelihood. Whenever they saw a cabbage grow out of the ground they would pick it and eat it immediately. My parents, and the group they were with, gave them seeds and told them not to eat the plant immediately, but wait until it produced seeds. 

Now, you might here this and just think that the people of Swaziland were ignorant to farming, and that that makes them uncivilized, and hopeless, but consider how much has been given to you.

There are quite a few I don't remember, but here are some I do.

1. Like others, when I was 4-6 I would have my private parts ""kiss"" my neighbors private parts (this happened with 3 different girls) until my mom walked in on me with my pj's down... It seemed natural at the time until I got in trouble.

2. I was with a friend who set a bus on fire in the bus yard, burned down to the frame. (4th grade)

3. I stabbed a fellow nerdy kid in the hand with a lead pencil because he was bugging me and the lead broke off in his hand.

4. My mom used to sing in the choir, during choir practice late at night, I would run around behind the alter and in the priest rooms in the back of the church -generally rifling through stuff, eating the body of christ, messing with the tabernacle and setting fire to those smoke cake things in the back parking lot.

5. My neighbor had the bright idea to assault passing cars, he had a slingshot and gave me the high powered bb gun. We both climbed a tree in the woods, the 3rd car I shot at, I broke both passenger side windows (multiple bbs in the barrel).  We both ran, driver filed a police report in town and later I went with my mom to turn myself in.

6. I threw an open face cheeseburger at a retarded kid (sitting near the trash) which hit him in the face and got ketchup and pickles all over his face, he ate alone and started to cry when everyone started laughing.  I did apologize to him later.

7. I got nominated to pickup about 10 pizzas and sodas which were paid for with a stolen CC down in NYC while I was stoned out of my mind.  I kept thinking it would be setup like a sting when I went in and I was going to go to jail.  Needless to say I went in, muttered some jibberish to the guy, signed and walked out with the pizzas.

8. just before my 16th bday, rolling with the wrong crowd, I somehow ended up making a bunch of money on my computer and using it.  I stopped but other people kept doing it using a photocopier, which needless to say, wasn't the same quality.  Long story short, they got busted, ratted me out and the secret service and state police came to my house.  I was on my class trip to Europe and they thought I was trying to evade arrest.  They were at the airport when I got back.  My moms hair turned gray that year.

I did break in to a few homes/barns, coaxed by that same bad crowd later on, one time eliciting a few shotgun blasts aimed toward us from an angry home owner.  We also used to run around on the roof of the seniors home late at night and drive to the mall stoned/drunk.

,-1,"Thank you again for your response.  I respectfully disagree with your synopsis of the Armenian Genocide.  Neither you or I were there, so your opinion of the event holds no more *a priori* value than does mine.  However, some things are indisputable.  Hundreds of thousands of Armenians were forcibly removed from their homes and forced to march.  Many hundreds of thousands died.

This is no different from the WWII Death Marches undertaken by the Nazi Germans at the end of the Second World War, or the [Bataan Death March](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bataan_Death_March) inflicted upon Filipino and American Prisoners of War by Imperial Japan.  Saying ""we didn't shoot them, they just died from starvation/exhaustion/dehydration/local violence"" etc is disingenuous in the extreme.  The march was planned.  It caused their death, according to plan.  Whether you were rounded up and forced to march depended upon your ethnicity.  Therefore, *by definition*, it was genocide.

Based on past actions (and how else can we judge Turkey's actions), the government ***self-evidently*** does NOT want to address the facts of the matter.  Prosecuting Orhan Pamuk ***RETROSPECTIVELY*** (for something that wasn't even a crime when he gave his interview), because he said *""I repeat, I said loud and clear that one million Armenians and 30,000 Kurds were killed in Turkey.""* is evidence enough to me that they (the government) are not serious.  This happened in ***2006***; only four years ago.  Pahmuk's statement is also rather akin to what you yourself have said above.  It is patently not anti-Turkish (whatever the heck that means).  I wonder if you would get much support were you to stand up outside the Blue Mosque in Istanbul with a placard repeating what you have said above?  I suspect you too may be ""visited"" by the local police.  And I doubt there would be international indignation and a global campaign on your behalf to have any charges dropped.  One wonders what would happen in that hypothetical circumstance.

WRT to torture and basic human rights (which are taken for granted in the EU), saying that it doesn't happen due to minor traffic infringements anymore is meaningless.  As I referred to above, Amnesty International have said that little progress has been made in this area.

Finally, claiming that I have no proper knowledge of the issues (how would you know?) and therefore, one assumes, cannot comment upon it is like saying that because I'm not German I can't talk about WWII and the Nazis.  That reaction alone proves my point!  The Turks have a long way to go.

,1,"&gt;I think you are missing my point. Everyone is entitled to an opinion about anything, but the fact that Israel's stand is oppressive is not universal truth, it's just an opinion. I understand you are thoroughly convinced in the opposite, but it still doesn't make it true. 

Sure, and the same right back at you. Everyone's talking in opinions here, and I never claimed otherwise, so now we're back at square one. 

&gt;Tell me why no one is talking about Hamas threats to kill Jews, their violent takeover of Gaza when they assassinated entire Fatah clans as they pleased, as well as many blown buses and cafes in Israeli cities. This is either a collective memory loss, or, more likely, a selective approach to judging things. 

Plenty of people talk about that. Nobody's claiming that Hamas is an innocent victim here. The many civilians who have no affiliation with Hamas, and whose greatest crime was being born Palestinian in Gaza... *those* are the innocent victims of the blockade. And if you want to talk about shortsighted politics, I fail to see how basically reducing the Gaza strip to a downright unlivable slum helps Israel in the long term. It just gives a whole generation of Palestinians a *fairly reasonable* set of reasons for hating Israel. 

&gt;Hamas was offered to renounce their claims to destroy Israel in exchange for peace and cooperation. Should be a simple choice, right?

That's not even close to the offer that was made. The *preconditions* for negotiation included:

* unconditionally recognizing Israel's right to most of the contested territory
* Acknowledging the legality of Israeli settlements that were built on occupied territories, which is illegal according to international law
* Abandoning attempts to negotiate the right of return for Palestinian refugees

Israel precluded any real negotiation by making its hardline stance a precondition for even beginning discussions.  

&gt;So maybe a point of view opposite to yours has at least as much ground as yours. 

Based on what?  

&gt;Which means that many people that are having issues with ""billions going to Israel"" have issues with Israel to begin with.

What do you mean by ""to begin with""? I do have a number of problems with Israel above and beyond the billions that America spends on it, is that what you're talking about? I have a problem with America's insistence on unconditionally vetoing any UN measure that is unfavorable to Israel. I also have a problem with Israel's refusal to negotiate for peace in good faith, and the fact that a number of innocent civilians who wanted nothing more than to provide humanitarian aid were brutally killed.

Am I holding Israel to a higher standard than oppressive dictatorships around the world? Of course I am, and why shouldn't I? Israel's a close ally, and you *should* be able to higher standards. If you couldn't, then why would they be your ally in the first place? And this is even more true when it's your own actions that enable them.

&gt;What would be less strange is that if some people were upset just about the money, but it's always the same theme of ""us financing those bastards"", kind of like a drumbeat. And that in turn sounds a lot like people from the other countries that, in the absence of own tax dollar factor, simply stick to ""those bastards"" line with mighty ferocity. Which btw you still didn't offer explanation for. 

I didn't answer it's not for me to answer. I can only speak with authority to why I take significant issue with the current direction of Israel. I don't know why other people think the things they do, and it's not my responsibility to answer for them. 

That said, if I had to go out on a limb, I'd say that other countries, particularly western European ones, understand that Muslim extremists are acutely aware of the role that many of them played in creating the Israeli nation post-WW2. Ever since, the existence of Israel, and the conditions under which it was created, has been a source of enormous tension between the west and most of the middle east, and the entire western world, to varying degrees, has suffered from this conflict. 

In of itself, that's just global politics at work. The governments that oversaw the creation of Israel understood that there would be backlash, and they played their role anyways. But what really gets to me, and what I imagine really gets to them as well, is how unwilling Israel is to negotiate for peace in good faith. Look again at the preconditions that I listed above: that's equivalent to saying 'peace is impossible', because frankly it's an unprecedented and ridiculous set of demands. Don't take my word for it, either, ask Noam Chomsky (unless he's now an antisemite too). 

Is there a double standard there? I'm not convinced, although I do think that there *should* be a double standard, again on the grounds that you should hold your allies to a higher standard. If Canada pulled half of the stunts that China routinely gets away with, we'd rightfully roast them, because they're supposed to be our allies.  And it wouldn't be because of antisemitism then, either. It would be because they're supposed to believe in freedom, equality, democracy, and all of that jazz, while China makes little to no such claim.

To me, it seems like you've already concluded that we're all antisemites, and you'll (mis)construe every opposing argument out there to make it true. Frankly, I find that a little paranoid and disingenuous, and your posts seem to contain far more underlying prejudice than most of the ones that you accuse of antisemitism. Still, I hope that I've at least managed to convince you that a lot of us put more nuanced thought into our positions than you initially seemed inclined to believe.

Obviously, players have far more power than they did before the EU obligated FIFA to allow them greater mobility. Both sides of the argument are solid. On the one hand, you need contractual stability in sports or it will be very difficult to build teams over time. On the other, athletes are among the few workers in a free market that have limited ability to change jobs, which is patently unfair. It's even worse in the US where players are ""drafted"" into what is for all intents and purposes indentured servitude. Obviously the obscene amounts of money they make tempers all of this a bit, but it's really the principle that is important. 

The EU gave FIFA a compromise, that is, contracts can be terminated for no valid reason (other than desire to do so) but at a penalty, that we've already discussed. I suspect that two things have been happening over the past decade in terms of the Webster ruling: 1) the compensation that would have to paid is strong enough that not many players are willing to do it; 2) clubs know that when a player wants to leave they will be able to do so for less money than their transfer fees, so once a player makes his desire known to move on they make the sale, even if they really don't want to.

I noticed that the players that have exercised their rights were not big stars, maybe because when a big star wants to leave they are allowed to do so by the club because they generally have huge transfer fees in their contract. Perhaps smaller stars don't have such fees written into their contracts and so it's more beneficial to the clubs to force them to pay the compensation.

questioning atheism is the right thing to do and shows mental maturity, in my mind.

each individual atheism declaration has to be put in context. Most people i know declaring themselves atheist come from a more or less religious family and thus declaration was part of their coming of age process.

I found that such atheists with a christian background are more often on sound morale grounds than the plain christians around, probably due to their ongoing  questioning and reasoning.

maybe read Christopher Hitchens: [""God Is Not Great""](http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/books_9780446579803.htm) or at least the summary. it testifies his journey toward atheism. He is a controversal person and i dont agree with everything he says, but the good stuff certainly prevails. It boils down to stating the established religions are about mindcontrol,
and that it is  human nature to want or need a higher power for guidance along the way of life.

while i dont know about other peoples mental powers, believes and will to subordinate, i certainly -want- to control my own mind, and yet at the same time i accept you may order a completely different dish. 

Also, besides lobbyism, i think Religious fundamentalism is the worst thing, either in your own country or abroad.
 to me, Atheism is the opposite believe. 

atheisim in the western world would not be such a large scale phenomenon if there was no christianity, in both a good and bad sense.

'Second generation' atheists probably question the christian morale grounds their atheist parents still had from their upbringing and start again to seek a better understanding in the mechanics of things. This may or may not lead again in the believe of some kind of higher entity. 

I  believe that religion is as personal as ones private live and therefore politics should be stricly separated from religion.
History proves that mixing those two provides for the best reason for war, only to camouflage the actual reason, gain of power.

ones believes are part of ones personality. questioning these believes from time to time is required.

Me? i dont believe in god in the traditional way, so i declare myself atheist, but i cant completely rule out any 'higher entity' either.

The final chapter of AM is called ""The point of view underlying this book is not the result of a well planned train of thought but of arguments prompted by accidental encounters.  Anger at the wanton destruction of cultural achievements from which we all could have learned, and at the conceited assurance with which some intellectuals interfere with the lives of people, and contempt for the treacly phrases that they use to embellish their misdeeds was and still is the motive force behind my work.""  Whew.  Anyway, in that chapter he talks about working at Berkeley and coming to see how the traditions of non western cultures deserve as much respect as what we inherit from European traditions as science.  I can't find any point at which he explicitly mentions epistemological post modernism though.  I guess I was just left with a strong feeling that he was getting at that.  
In fact, in the first chapter he demonstrates some disdain for postmodernism.  In a footnote he mentions that he has come to believe that the use of reason in exploring alternative methods such as anarchistic science is becoming more important in order to protect against the chaotic and potentially inhumane results of postmodernist philosophy.  He was writing in 1975 at Berkeley, so I'm not surprised that he would want to distance himself from that crowd.  His arguments hinge on our accepting him as a rationalist who through honest research has reached the conclusions expressed in Against Method.

I really enjoyed visiting Kaliningrad and was pleasantly surprised with the area.  While it is true that a lot of the city consists of concrete blocks of flats constructed with prefabricated materials it is nowhere near as horrible as a lot of people would paint it to be.  There aren’t many traditional tourist attractions but a city has some surprisingly good restaurants, including a few pretty nice Japanese sushi/grill places.  Clubbing is fairly decent with one really impressive place called Vagonka.  Shopping on the other hand was a bit of a let down.  Knowledge of at least basic Russian is a necessity as even in hotels and restaurants foreign languages are rarely spoken.  
The city feels relatively safe and clean.  I would not risk driving to Kaliningrad region though  as crossing the border by car can prove to be a painful and lengthy experience.  The streetlights even at major intersections were turned off and traffic seemed rather chaotic.  The locals were friendly, although I had some problems with rude Russian train staff, who mistook me for a cigarette smuggler.   Border patrol officers are also intimidating. I had my passport collected by a guy in full camouflage gear and a kalshnikov on his shoulder.  I believe that locals consider themselves to be different, more European than their compatriots from Russia proper. Unfortunately it is also very clear that Russian authorities are not interested in loosening their grip on the enclave and do very little if anything to promote tourism and cooperation with neighboring countries.

Yes, good question. You're right that in times of crisis there are many commodities that are important, so how does gold fit in?

There is a report by a European describing a great hunt (with rifles and horses) in which the Indians killed thousands of Buffalo.

Yeah, and who exactly found Israel of being evil? I'll give you a hint: Europe's Muslims, who affect the media and government using their violent protests.

&gt; Amazing paranoia.

Is it? How many times has the UN done something against Iran? When Lebanon was proven by Israel to be arming their southern border after the 2nd Lebanon War, an act which the UN deemed illegal, what did they do? If you don't know, it's because they didn't actually do anything.

The difference: Israel builds bomb shelters. [Hamas steals aid money](http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/06/03/gaza.un/index.html?hpt=T2).

Here's my plan for the $100,000
I'm going to complete every one of the non-North American [REI Adventure treks](http://www.rei.com/adventures/date/date.html), at least everyone once, I won't be doing the Kilimanjaro climb every single time they offer it. I'll be hiking to Everest, exploring the Amazon, crossing Europe, the Galapagos Islands, Machu Picchu, etc etc. 
If it becomes obvious that the REI treks are horrendous and they don't know what they are doing, I'll find an equivalent trek elsewhere and use them instead. 

Furthermore, I will complete the [Students on Ice Arctic Expedition](http://studentsonice.com/index.php?content=arctic_expeditions), whenever they open signups for the next one.  I would choose to do the Antarctic trip, but I won a full scholarship to do that this past winter.

So all of that total comes out to be about $40-$50k, so here's the catch. For the Arctic trip, I will anonymously donate a full scholarship to pay for one of the students who needs it most. I was granted that opportunity and would like to pay it forward. So now I have $30K left to spend. You know how I said I wouldn't do the North American Treks? that's because with the remaining money, I'm going to hike all three major North American trails. The Appalachian, the Pacific-Crest, and the Continental Divide Trail. That's 7,400 miles of hiking. Only about 2 dozen people have done it completely. That's would put me up there with Armando Galarraga and his perfect game. I would do it. And if I was seriously injured as is very possible, I would finance someone else to complete the trail. For these trails, it's estimated that you spend about 1 dollar a mile, so I would still have $33-43k left to spend

This whole process would take several years, during which time I would defer from college and come back as a total badass. With $33-43k left to burn.  Which means one thing. I'm hiking Everest.

By now, with probably close to 10,000 miles hiked, I'll be at the peak of my physical performance. I'm going to hike Mt. Everest. Estimates range from $25-60k to do it, and I'm a cheap motherfucker, so I should be able to afford it still.

,1,"I don't believe in a Christian God, I believe in the one and only God that's responsible for all of us. I just believe that Christianity has proven itself to be the most legitimate way of presenting God's existence. 

The reason why I don't follow the Old Testament as much (and most Christians) is because as Jesus, everything was fulfilled. God mentions that he's not here to abolish the laws, but to fulfill them. Some things have changed, that is why Judaism is different than Christianity. This is why we are allowed to eat pork, this is why we don't have to keep two dishwashers in our house. 

You're correct, the same God indeed. God gave us freewill and if we abuse freewill we deserve to get punished for it. You are 'free' to do whatever you want, there are consequences, both in human nature and the God that you will have to answer to one day.

I disagree with the fact that 'godly influence' hasn't been part of human advancement within thought. God has been used as a control system for many great leaders of the past, and current, and this is what is popularly expressed in history. The major Christian charities of Europe, especially during Nietzsche's time, and probably the whole Catholic Church, was all corrupt. It's very easy to fool people with God, and it's worked beautifully. Not enough has been mentioned of the missionaries sent out by various Pope's in the past, or other peoples influenced by God. I know the U.S. doesn't like to say it is a Christian country in this manner, but the Supreme Court is decorated by the Commandments, and we are the largest Christian populated country in the world.

,3,"Agricultural runoff from livestocking contributes millions of pounds of greenhouses gases (particularly methane) to the atmosphere every year; furthermore, waste from livestock factory farms is exceptionally good at polluting local water supplies, particularly with nitrates.  Large bodies of water downstream from livestock farms typically suffer from eutrophication, the process by which lakes are essentially suffocated to death.  This is to say nothing of the human impacts of such pollution, which in some areas has been linked to birth defects and higher cancer rates.  Finally, agricultural waste disposal can easily infiltrate soils and groundwater, rendering these soils and aquifers highly toxic.

Land use practices could be significantly improved.  Land use conversions, such as clearing rainforest to grow crops for feedstock or for live stocking, release an incredible amount of CO2-- reducing meat consumption reduces the need for such conversions, and as I mentioned elsewhere cropland currently used to produce feedstock could be used to produce vegetables and grains suitable for human consumption.  The sustainability and effectiveness of our agricultural support systems would be dramatically improved.

Perhaps the greatest environmental benefit of this would be for water.  Water pollution has already been discussed, but think of the incredible amount of water it takes to produce a pound of beef vs. a pound of corn.  In 1985 Chinese people ate, on average, 20kg of meat; this year, they will eat around 50kg. This difference translates into 390km3 (1km3 is 1 trillion liters) of water-almost as much as total water use in Europe.  The capacity to save and repurpose water is, in this sense, tremendous.

Ecologically speaking, severely curtailing our meat consumption is one of the best things we could do in America and the world in general.  For many traditionalist, subsistence cultures livestock agriculture is and will remain a critical part of everyday life, but in the Western world it is largely vestigial and extremely destructive.  This is one of the largest reasons why I haven't eaten meat in almost 8 years.  Although, as others have pointed out, this may have some negative economic consequences, the negative externalities associated with consuming meat all day, every day (not atypical for the modern American) will be hard to ignore for much longer.

So your point is that those Jews should have just accepted that they lived in countries that were going to kill them and shut up about it. 

&gt;that doesn't justify taking a land that belongs to another people.

I am not sure what ""taking"" and what ""belonging"" you refer to. The Jews were not going door to door kicking out Arabs. And the land ""belong"" either to landowners, who sold to Jews, or to the Ottomans and then the British. In that case letting Jews in or not is a political position, not a moral point. The British changed their mind on Jewish immegration to Palestine because of Arab violence and a British decision to align with the Arabs. Not because somehow they decided that the Palestinians had some superior moral justification.

&gt;Also, i think one question that is very important is why didn't the Europeans and the U.S. allow Jews to immigrate into their respective countries?

But they had that right, isn't that part of your point? The Jews were not wanted anywhere, so they should have died in place.

,1,"Trust me on this one - you do NOT need to be in any hurry.

  I'm 41 years old. I have a 2 year old, a 6 year old, and a 20 year old. I also have a 23 year old (but I never met him, gave him up for adoption in high school). 

  You have all the time in the world. You'll probably complete your college years (a good idea in this professional climate - there are no jobs yet). While you're there and for the years after spend time having fun, meeting girls, getting laid, and enjoying life. Go on bike rides, travel to Mexico or Europe or Japan, eat strange foods, and love your family (assuming you have one). These are, in many ways, the best years of your life. Enjoy them!

  After that, you will find a girl (trust me, you will!) who is perfect for you. She will be pretty, fun, and ready for the serious relationship that you're talking about. You will regret that she wasn't there for all the fun stuff you did in College, but that's OK. you will both create even better memories later on. This will happen.

  And don't settle for the first girl who ""seems right"". Trust me on this - the worst thing you could do is rush into marriage or kids. It's not fair to you, to her, and ESPECIALLY not to the kids. If it seems a bit tricky, manipulative or strange, let it go. If it's a bit odd but fun, true, and honest (I mean REALLY honest), then keep going and see where it takes you.

  I'm lucky, although many might disagree. I had a teen pregnancy and we had parents who were smart enough to tell us to give the child up for adoption. I'll regret never knowing that child, but I do know that whatever life that child has, it's better than the one I could provide at the time. 

  My oldest Daughter (20 years) is awesome and rebellious (like her Dad). I found out about her when she was about 4 years old. After 10+ years of us both growing up together (and about $200,000 of child support - I won't elaborate), she is moving forward with her life and becoming independent. I'm very proud of her and I love her very much. 

  My 6 year old daughter is the result of a failed marriage. My Ex seemed ""normal"" when we met, but she was young (24) and I didn't know how much she would change as she matured. She went all religious on me and I ended up leaving her abusive and judgmental ways. I was miserable for about a year after, but I kept my focus on my Daughter. She is the most wonderful person!

  In an almost random way, I met my current Fiancé. We were on a hike with a mutual friend and it just clicked. We took it slow - she didn't even meet my daughter for the first 6 months. After that, we eased into a permanent relationship. We have been together for 5 years. We had a child together (voluntarily) almost 2 years ago. He's a great little kid. We may get married next year - no hurry.

  She was 36 and I was 39 when he was born. She was all paranoid about her ""clock"" and the whole mess of having kids at a later age, but I wouldn't change a thing, and neither would she. We are so lucky. And I know the science points in the other direction, but kids are waaay easier to have even in your late 30's.

  You have all the time in the world, man! Don't worry about your clock, and don't worry about meeting the right girl. these things will happen if you have patience. You appear to have all the right stuff for a great life - do your self a favor and do not enter into it too hastily. You will know when it's right - it will just feel that way.

  And - lastly - never enter into any relationship (wife, kids, friends, jobs) with any strong expectations. If they are selfish, then don't make time for them. Let people be who they are and you will be constantly surprised by their capacity to love and to give back. 

tl;dr: Be honest with yourself and those you love - it all works out, there is no other alternative

Reading this list reaffirmed that I am fortunate to have grown up in Canada in a tolerant household (as many of these items would be a problem elsewhere).  My take on the list:

1.  Doesn't apply to me, I have no ambition to be on TV or in movies.

2. Yes, I do.  Also, I don't even see many heads turn when I do.

3. I'm in my mid-twenties, so as a young child this wasn't the case, however as a teenager there were tons of queer folk in main stream media/culture/government to look up to.

4.  True-ish, but not that applicable.  Most people I knew (both family and friends) were waiting for me to be comfotable enough with myself to ""come out"".  Very few assumed me to be heterosexual, and as such I wasn't raised to feel that was how I must end up.

5.  This is a big issue.  I didn't know a thing about safe sex practices for gay sex.  Luckily the first guy I was with was more informed, so I learned that condoms were for more than preventing pregnancy.

6.  I do feel comfortable.  When I speak about my husband, I treat his gender as the non-issue that it is.  Occasionaly it'll catch someone off guard a bit, but it never turns ugly and in most cases the conversation continues in the exact way it would if I had made the same statement about a wife.

7. I had/have many role models to look up to that I respect.  I don't think that sexual orientation has anything to do with how much of a role model someone can be.

8. Why is this important? (see #7)

9.  I don't give a flying fuck if crazy people who believe in a magic man in the sky accept me, but am fortunate to live in a country where the government does.

10.  I am a man and am legally married to a man, and some religious people attended and took part in the marriage.

The scholarship is based on the income on your parents (the more they make, the less you get). It ranges between €100 and €3500 per year (also based on how many courses you're taking. No minimal grade limit required). If you fail your first year you have a 're-orientation scholarship' of the same amount of money to start with a different study. If you fail your first year three times only operational costs (books, travel etc..) can be refunded. If you can't afford to rent a place near the university you can enroll in the 'dorm program' which will place you in student dorms with a rent also based on your parents income (between €78/month to a max of €250 a month). Privately held appartements and houses range between €200 and €600 for a more luxurious condo.

Students are motivated to enroll in the Erasmus Program which allows you to study abroad and get scholarships if they do so.


Student Loans do exists but are controlled by the gov with the university's help.
They range between €1000 and €10.000 (post-graduate) have NO interest and you have start paying back 2 years after you get your degree or 1 year after you drop out.

,1,"Everyone here has made extremely valid and true points and all I can really do is add.  
First off I've lived in Canada for 17 years now, my family immigrated here when I was 4, and the one thing that seems to stand out over all these years is *diversity* of quite literally everything.  
The west end of the country is completely different from the East for starters. You have the video game (and supposid weed) hub of Canada out in Vancouver. My best friend goes to UBC and all I hear about is gorgeous (fairly mild) weather with amazing scenery. There's a bit of cultural diversity out there but it's mostly whites, orientals, and aboriginals.  
In the middle of the country you have a lot of flat land, and to be honest when you hear of people moving to Canada from another country they usually don't go to Calgary (and sure as hell not Regina), but they're just another experience here. In the middle is flat flat flat flat land as far as the eye can see, and (I think anyway) has more of a small town feel even if Calgary is one of the larger cities in Canada. To be honest I don't know much more about the area. I had a friend who lived in Airdrie Alberta (just outside of Calgary) and the vibe I got was straight southern-style small town (without the religious fanatics).  
Then you come to Ontario. Anyone in Quebec will tell you Torontonians are a prudish work-driven bunch but you spend some time in the GTA and you'll learn otherwise. EVERYONE and EVERYTHING is accepted in Ontario (I'm going to mostly refer to Toronto and the GTA because that's where I live). It's a fun city with a VERY multicultural population (I'm talking quite literally everything you can imagine, Asians, Eastern Europeans, Regular Europeans, Africans, Middle Easterners, South Americans, and I swear to god each group has its own village within Toronto somewhere. The weather will hit lows of -30c with several feet of snow, and we get highs of 35c with blistering humidity. Then sometimes the sky will just open up and it'll rain for a week on end.  
Then you head out to Quebec, Hull, Montreal - French Canada. This whole place is basically the Europe of the west. Parties and cafe's and a very distinct night life and a very particular culture. And don't get me wrong, Quebec is a great place to raise a family too, it's not just for trendy hipsters. The weather out there is fairly similar to most of Ontario with a bit more precipitation. The land seems to have more character out there however. Parts of Ontario are very flat and green, but Quebec has some small hills and mountains lying all over the place. Montreal is built at the foot of a mountain, and so is Quebec City I believe.  
As for the maritimes I know very little. Basically like the middle of Canada you don't usually get people moving there from other countries. From what I know predominantly white population with some French interlaced with the English. Lots of water, lots of fish, lots of seafood, a lot like Maryland from what I've heard.  
Here's the thing about Canada though, it doesn't matter where you live because everyone everywhere is... well smart. Not saying you're not gonna run in to a few stupid people, but even our stupid people are kind of smart. Most places (I feel) are very liberal in their mindsets, and everyone sort of cares about each other to a degree. Even our conservative governments are in actuality pretty liberal on the scale. Almost everyone is weed friendly, Crime rates are way lower than anything you can imagine in America, being gay isn't even something anyone thinks about, there are very few religious fanatics and NONE like you hear about in America (WBC condemns Canada anyway). I honestly can keep going on like this. Yes, you will pay a lot in income tax, yes there are some downsides, the weather does get a bit extreme, and we have federal elections as often as we have halloween.

,5,"Part of what you say is true and I'm sorry if I came across too strong, this is a point I feel slightly strongly about, so, yeah. 

&gt;I'm not arguing that Indian culture at the time was primitive, far from &gt;it. And I understand that people at the time could be very dismissive &gt;of other cultures. But are you sure that your Indian history professors &gt;aren't doing the same thing a bit in the other direction? Was the &gt;richness you mention spread throughout the people, or was it &gt;concentrated in the hands of the few rulers?

Fair enough as to what you claims. But here's the problem, at no point during that time was 'richness' spread through any citizenry. Look at Europe, it had it's rising populace of 'Royal Families' and industrialist who were definitely not even a large enough faction of it's population. As I recall, the French Revolution, The Russian Revolution, both were such examples.

The point I'm trying to make is that, you can't say, theirs isn't perfect therefore we can fix it. (I can't remember but there's a TED Presentation out there that compares the development of countries 'post-independence' and shows that African and Asian countries are doing much better now, than before. If anyone could find it, it would be awesome.)

The problem is with this, a lot of this money sucking lead to these countries ending up being poor NOW. I can vouch for India. And I'm sure any decent amount of research would have you vouch for other such colonial nations.

&gt;As I said, the countries that kept British legal traditions are much more &gt;prosperous than those that lost them. Prior membership in the British &gt;Empire is no guarantee of anything, but some countries (Singapore, &gt;Hong Kong) managed to hold onto the good legal system even after &gt;British rule ended. Most of the bad governments have had plenty of &gt;time to get their act together. At some point you can't blame the last &gt;guy anymore.

That **is exactly** the problem. In this case, the last guy(s) fucked up big time. Try and read [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Europe_Underdeveloped_Africa) book if possible, it details how Europe fucked Africa.

Your argument of countries that have kept on British traditions is also slightly flawed.A lot of countries continued to do. Some to larger parts, being a law student, I will tell you that the judicial system in India is an out and out colonial inheritance. The Indian Penal Code, 1872 (Accidentally the exam I'm going flunk from last week, ok kidding) was passed by the British, and that's just a slightly large one. Almost out entire legal system comes out of the British, modified to Indian post-independence.

On one hand, self-determination and autonomy are the values that seem to be most important to Americans - this is reflected in things such as private healthcare and gun ownership; essentially a notion that one's survival is primarily one's own responsibility. 

Conversely, there is an almost blind love for the flag and country; yet I've never been able to figure out why this love stops somewhere beyond the flag, yet short of your next door neighbour. Why is it seen as admirable to fight and die for your country (ie protecting the weaker), yet to support the unknown neighbour down the road and have him support you is something seen as detrimental?

Most bizarrely, however, is the almost utilitarian view taken towards work. Americans have so few rights as employees, yet some argue (and this seems to generally include those with the least rights and the least pay) that this is fundamentally important to a functional society. From an outsider it appears that a rule exists that it is ok to shaft those below you, but those above you must be accorded respect. And this is something far closer to the old Europe that we threw away and, frankly, don't want back.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/turkey/7798493/Gaza-flotilla-attack-Turkish-activists-killed-in-raid-wanted-to-be-martyrs.html

Since you won't believe that link, since it's not a conspiracy theory, here's a video:

http://dailyradar.com/beltwayblips/video/gaza-flotilla-participants-aspire-to-die-as-martyrs/

Have you heard of Hamas? They are linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. Did you know that many of the members on the floatilla were part of the MB? Probably not. That or you ignore that fact, because it doesn't fit with your ideology.

* The Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas, founded in 1987 in Gaza, is a wing of the Brotherhood, formed out of Brotherhood-affiliated charities and social institutions that had gained a strong foothold among the local population.

* Simply put, the Brotherhood saw the flotilla as a public relations weapon that could be used to assist their fellow Ikhwan. 

* The flotilla was organized in large part by a radical Turkish Islamist organization named IHH (Islan Haklary Ve Hurriyetleri Vakfi). The IHH, in turn, is part of a Saudi-based umbrella group called the Union of Good, which was created by Hamas. The U.S. Treasury Department designated the Union of Good a terrorist organization in 2008. Of course, Hamas itself was designated a terrorist organization many years ago.

In other words, the IHH is an offshoot of the Union of Good, which is in turn an offshoot of the Brotherhood -- as is Hamas. It is a matter of basic logic, then, that if the IHH was one of the prime movers behind the flotilla then that means the Brotherhood itself was.

* Two of the passengers, as revealed by the indispensable MEMRI organization, are members of the Muslim Brotherhood’s bloc in the Egyptian parliament. One of the two, Muhammad al Baltaji, is the deputy secretary general of the Muslim Brotherhood’s parliamentary contingent. 

MEMRI quotes al Baltaji as saying recently, “A nation that excels at dying will be blessed by Allah with a life of dignity and with eternal paradise.”

Al Baltaji also explained the flotilla’s purpose this way: “The flotilla participants have two aims: to reach Gaza and break the siege, and to denounce Israel if it prevents the flotilla from entering Gaza, even at the cost of martyrdom or imprisonment.”

* Three of the flotilla’s passengers were members of the Yemeni Islah party, which is led by the aforementioned Zindani. Sheikh Zindani is a globally designated terrorist and a longtime benefactor of Osama bin Laden.

* The Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood was represented too. Again, we can turn to MEMRI to learn that at least four Jordanian Brotherhood members, including high-ranking officials, were among the flotilla’s passengers.

MEMRI quotes one of them, Salam al Falahat, the “general guide of the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan from 2006 to 2008” as saying last year: ""We in the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan see Palestine as part of the Islamic and Arab land that must not be relinquished – on the contrary, defending it is a national and jurisprudential obligation... We see Hamas movement in Palestine as standing at the head of the project of the Arab and Islamic liberation for which the Muslim Brotherhood calls... The Muslim Brotherhood supports Hamas and every Arab resistance movement in the region that works for liberation.""

You and your anti-semite friends continue to cry propaganda (along with your little Hitler and oven jokes), yet the propaganda machine at work is the MB.

Again, nothing excuses Israel shooting these people when they could have been subdued in other ways, but nothing excuses you excusing terrorists. Yes, terrorists. Do I agree with the blockade? It's a tricky subject, for safety reasons yes, for huminitarian reasons, no. But do I agree with people car bombing, scudding, and running blockades so they can aid folks doing just this? No. Certainly there may have been aid, but aid for people who, well, condone terrorism to take a place that isn't theirs. 

Can they co-exist? It would be nice. But it's hard to co-exist with someone when they only want all of your people dead, yet they make a stink when people who made martyr videos, claimed they were going to run the blockade and might die, and filled out their wills before embarking on the boat run into trouble. Everyone on that floatilla knew what they were doing, where they were going, etc. It's just sad they had to die.

If I know the cops are going to be blocking off the president's visit, and I run at the them with sticks, pipes, and knives. And worse yet, I try to take their weapons.

,3,"Mom, I appreciate that you shared your opinion and were willing to debate it in a public forum. I checked out your website, and this issue aside, you seem like a nice person with a lot of good information to share.

In case you're curious, I'd like to offer one explanation for the level of emotion you see in this debate. For many people, including myself, such comments about public breastfeeding are received in a similar manner to a comment like, ""I don't want to have to ride the bus with black/chinese/gay/etc people."" 

You might disagree with that comparison, but it's one that is held by many breastfeeding advocates who have faced discrimination and now are relieved that there are laws to support them. I would speculate that most people react to discriminatory (to their ears) speech differently from that of mere opinion about a given subject.

The anti-public breastfeeding folks here seem to be suggesting that public breastfeeding is an arbitrary choice, and that perfectly suitable alternatives exist. Just from a logistical standpoint that does not seem to map to many people's reality. The assertion that a mother can simply go home, or be at home when a feeding need arises implies an expectation that all moms have the luxury to travel in private transportation, on brief and carefully planned outings. There's a rarefied air to such an assumption. Also, you'd be hard pressed to find any doctor who would say that formula is an equivalent replacement to breast milk for a newborn.

Also, you and others here had mentioned that a mother can simply delay feeding of a child until they reach home, and one poster made a comparison to a pushy 5 year old kid. This also does not map to the reality of either a hungry 2 month old baby or an engorged breast that cannot wait an hour or so to be dealt with. I've seen that posters on your own website have similarly heated emotions, though perhaps a bit more polite.

One of your own commenters echoed a similar line:

&gt;Private breastfeeding is ideal, but it just isn't
&gt;always possible..feeding a baby is not a matter of convenience, it is a
&gt;matter of FEEDING when necessary and sorry if that might have to be on a
&gt;park bench, at a restaurant , in church or wherever it needs to
&gt;be…for the love of God, put this in perspective…it isn't porn, it
&gt;isn't something that a mother couldn't explain to her children who might
&gt;see a mother nursing an infant in public

So to wrap up: rightly or wrongly, your comments are seen by some people as bigoted, and thus high emotions come into play. Also, some of the assumptions about the situations mothers find themselves in don't seem to map to reality in a world where moms work, go to school, care for children, run errands, and sometimes have to take public transportation, all of which can keep them away from home for many hours. The only situation that I can imagine where your conditions would always apply is if the mom stays at home all day and only leaves the house when she feels like it.

I've seen moms nursing openly in Mexico, Europe, and Asia and did not get the sense that single observing child was harmed. If you're interested, please take a look at the following website where moms around the world discuss their public breastfeeding experiences. You might be surprised how common it is.

Why would ANY man in a western country get married with the current family law court system biased against them?

,1,"&gt;I never said it was easy. That's why making excuses is a sense of entitlement. It is possible, but people want the easy way out. If they choose the easy way out, i don't have sympathy for not liking the consequences to the decisions they've made.

I never talked about anything being easy. I talked about if it was possible, worthwhile, and desirable. Furthermore, whether the alternatives are easy or hard, they do not justify centuries of exploitation.

Would you consider everything to be just if despite being forced to pay for using the king's land, the king allowed you to go into the forest and become a hermit? Easy or hard, the fact of the matter is that the king's claim of landownership is unjust, and his demand for payment is exploitative. 

Capitalists have their capital because they exploited workers to get it. Their claim of ownership is morally equivalent to their exploitation of workers, and their demands for payment to use their capital constitute exploitation upon exploitation. An alternative way of life might be a nice way to get out of such a bad situation, if there were a good one, but it still doesn't make it right, not any more than being able to become a hermit in the forest justifies feudalism.

&gt;It's a good thing, because every other attempted system has been much worse.

Up here in Aragon one was among tens of thousands of people, mainly though not entirely of working-class origin, all living at the same level and mingling on terms of equality. **In theory it was perfect equality, and even in practice it was not far from it.** There is a sense in which it would be true to say that one was experiencing a foretaste of Socialism, by which I mean that the prevailing mental atmosphere was that of Socialism. Many of the normal motives of civilized life--snobbishness, money-grubbing, fear of the boss, etc.--had simply ceased to exist. The ordinary class-division of society had disappeared to an extent that is almost unthinkable in the money-tainted air of England; there was no one there except the peasants and ourselves, and **no one owned anyone else as his master.**""

The wiki article on Spain during the revolution goes on to say:

&gt;""The anarchist held areas were run according to the basic principle of ""From each according to his ability, to each according to his need."" In some places, money was entirely eliminated, to be replaced with vouchers. Under this system, **goods were often up to a quarter of their previous cost**.

&gt;Despite the critics clamoring for maximum efficiency, **anarchic communes often produced more than before the collectivization.** The newly liberated zones worked on entirely libertarian principles; decisions were made through councils of ordinary citizens without any sort of bureaucracy. (The CNT-FAI leadership was at this time not nearly as radical as the rank and file members responsible for these sweeping changes.)

&gt;In addition to the economic revolution, there was a spirit of cultural revolution. **Oppressive traditions were done away with. For instance, women were allowed to have abortions, and the idea of ""free love"" became popular.** In many ways, this spirit of cultural liberation was similar to that of the ""New Left"" movements of the 1960s.""

I'd say that's a pretty big improvement.

&gt;We wouldn't all be better off if we took the land in today's system, because you'd be impoverishing other people that own that land. Other people that sacrificed their labor/life/time to own that land. Because banks are loaning other people's money. People that do own their property and loan it out to people to live in are providing value.

You and I have very different definitions of poverty. I consider poverty to be a situation where you are unable to get basic necessities. If you're homeless, if you can't afford medical care, if you can't afford food, and so on, you're in poverty. If everyone has a home and a place to work, and if there is welfare for people who are unable to work, then poverty would exist only where people have the ability to work but choose not to.

There are probably some people who have done what you're talking about. Nevertheless, the loss of a few homes, except the one they live in, should be well-compensated by the corresponding gain in ownership of their workplace. Since all profits from their work will go to them, not shareholders, they won't need to work nearly as much as before. I don't consider this poverty, and I think that even in this case, it would probably be a good deal. 

Suppose you worked for [Exxon Mobil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exxon_Mobil) for 30 years to buy three homes, including your own. You might get, say, $36,000/year in rent from the two homes that you're not living in (assuming $1,500/mo. in rent for each home). If Exxon became worker-owned, its $34.7 billion annual operating income would be divided across 79,900 employees, for an average of $434,200 per employee per year. In one year, you would earned as much extra money as the two homes would have gained you in 12 years. The gains would be different for different companies, but the principle is the same. Everyone who works for capitalists has something to gain from socialism.

&gt;For example, if someone proclaims that they ""own"" a house and don't want to pay anything for it, what is to stop me from barging in and tossing them out and proclaiming ""i own the house""? You want to abolish property rights and yet someone have people own their own homes.

I want to abolish private property rights. I absolutely want to abolish the right to own something that someone else uses. I don't want to abolish personal property rights. If you use something, I want it to be yours. I want you to own your own home, no strings attached, no further payment required. I want you to own your workplace, along with your coworkers, and share your company's profits among yourselves. 

To use my analogy with feudalism again, it's not that I want to abolish the right to own land. I just want the king's land to become your land.

What isn't charity is when a politician appeals to your charitable instincts during his campaign, saying such things as ""If I'm elected, children will no longer have to go hungry!"" or other nice little sound bites like that.  He then gets elected, takes everyones money, squanders it on a bloated, inefficient, heartless bureaucracy that often times shafts the very people it was intended to create (i.e.- there was a post the other day here on reddit about how terrible homeless shelters are in New York, and one only has to look at the abject misery that many children in our foster children live through to see the problems in that system).  Then, when a challenger arises and says that the instituted system isn't helping people, that there is more crime now than there was ten years ago, that people aren't being helped with this program, and that the program is wasting everyone's time, energy, and money, the oh-so-generous man in office demonizes his opponent and says that he will take money away from orphans and hates the homeless.

As for the whole ""terrible boss"" scenario that you were describing, I've never had a problem with it.  I worked under a terrible boss one time as a life guard, but I maintained my professionalism and simply worked harder.  When it came time for evals for the company, myself and my fellow lifeguards all put down our problems with the boss in question.  She got fired.  We were rewarded for our work.  The system corrected itself.

Sometimes, the system doesn't work.  It's a shame.  But last time I checked, there is no God and thus, there is no such thing as a perfect entity.  Even computers can make massive errors, and their components are made up of incredibly temperamental, emotional, humans leading complex, difficult lives.

,2,"The best way I can summarize why we have this duplicitous nature is that we have this belief that we are the land of the self-made man and that anyone can succeed here with enough hard work and determination. This belief carries with it the idea that someone who isn't successful deserves to not be successful b/c they must have been lazy or made poor choices, etc... and those who are successful (CEOs, for example) are deserving of respect despire how horrific their characters... b/c at least they are hard workers. Most Americans hold the idea of a land of self-determination very dear to their hearts and when they wrap themselves up in the flag, they are really wrapping themselves up in the idea that they want to protect a system where anyone can make themselves into whatever they want to become.  These same Americans view social programs as a form of ""cheating"" that undermines this idea of self-determination.  How can we tell who really deserves admiration and respect b/c of their self-determination if some people are living middle-class lives thanks to handouts? It undermines the entire idea that the poor are poor because they deserve to be and the middle-class and wealthy are where they are because of their hardwork and determination. If you think about it, the *ONLY* story of failure that Americans tolerate is a story where someone failed repeatedly, but kept trying, and ultimately became a success because of their perseverence.  You'll never find a Hollywood blockbuster or NY Times bestseller about someone who tried their ass off and ultimately ended up failing at everything. We just don't tolerate failures b/c we believe people only fail b/c they are quitters/lazy/or make poor choices.
I find these American views antiquated, cruel, and duplicitous, as well, but this is why they feel the way they do. 

Europe, on the other hand, grew up with royalty, a gentry, Lords, and a long history of a wealthy/educated class that was wealthy/educated by birthright rather than self-determination.

&gt; yet I've never been able to figure out why this love stops somewhere beyond the flag, yet short of your next door neighbor.

absolutely crazy, I agree. I believe it is indoctrination from a young age. We are taught in public schools that the flag and the government is what defines our life. The government is what we turn to to solve problems, so the neighbor down the street doesn't need our help, they just need to go to the government.

This type of indoctrination reaps rewards for the elite at the top. They have people that volunteer to go off and die in foreign lands to secure corporate profits. Absolutely amazing, especially if you're the one at the top pulling all the strings.

&gt; Most bizarrely, however, is the almost utilitarian view taken towards work. Americans have so few rights as employees, yet some argue

I'll disagree with you here. I have worked for some european companies and many coworkers were from europe (france in particular), so I can see both systems and enjoyed some benefits from both systems.

The thing about this system is that it rewards small businesses. I think it must be a monumental task to start a business in europe with all the labor laws. This really isn't to your point though, because you're wondering why I as a worker don't want my rights protected by the government. The reason is, because I think of myself as a small business. I might work for a big company, but I know that when a better job comes along, I'm out the door without restriction. 

Because of this, I don't think europe has as much job hopping as occurs in the US. You view this as a plus, in that you'll always have a job. I view it as stagnation though, because if I upgrade my skillset, I want to make more money. Many times this will require leaving a company and going to a new one.

Luckily, up here in Toronto, there is a 3 floor H&amp;M which offers a wide variety of options for people like us. Check out their site, they have a great interactive store where you can layer clothes on virtual mannequins

- If you can afford it, nothing beats an Italian/European clothing store. I accidentally came across one and wandered in to take a look. The people there were very knowledgable and quickly offered solutions, which I purchased and haven't stopped loving. I go there once or twice per year to get new shirts, pants and jackets.

- Some jackets and suits offer special cuts for people like us. I am not sure if suits and jackets are your style, but if they are, be on the lookout for ""continental"" cut.

- Look for unhemmed jeans and pants. They are usually 1 to 2 inches longer and are made to be hemmed once you are in them. 

- Someone mentioned getting your shirts fitted - yes, do that. You can get other things fitted as well, so find a tailor and talk to them.

- Don't wear XL or L shirts. The largest shirt/t-shirt that I own is an M and fits great - the sleeves are perfect, the length is perfect, the only complaint is that it is a little wider. Before you say anything, I am just like you - same height, same weight (OK, 135 lbs) and have the same waist size - 29. If I try a 30 on, I would need to use a belt.

Also, stay away from department store dress-shirts. I spent a lot of money on them like an idiot before I discovered slim-fit dress shirts. I got some of them fitted, but thats an extra cost and requires finding a tailor.

My girlfriend is German (mentioned in many of my previous comments) and I do a lot of business in Germany (also mentioned in previous comments, I'm actually going to Berlin on Monday to do a pitch).


Anyway, in Germany if you want to start trading as a business, you just...do it, you don't even have to register with the government until you've been trading for 3 months. At the end of your tax year, you simply fill in your tax return (just as you do in many countries) and they tax office send you a bill back which is purely your income tax, the same as you'd pay if you were employed. No fees or licensing or any of that other stuff you mentioned.

,4,"European conquest of North America was brutal, but you're right: North America was sparsely populated with hunter-gatherer tribes. (Such societies have relatively small numbers because they have to be mobile.) Sedantary agrarian societies tend to amass much, much larger populations. In North America, this tended to happen in Mexico with Mayans and Aztecs. They actually had cities. Their cousins to the North—in what is now the United States—never evolved complex, city-based civilzations. So the populations were much, much smaller than they were in Mexico.

That said, ethnic cleansing happened and many people died—either through disease, warfare or outright starvation as whites kept pushing them farther and farther away from their traditional hunting lands. Cast out of lush fields and forests in, say, New York or Massachusetts, they found themselves in dusty, hot [and unliveable] Oklahoma or Texas. No trees, very little game and inhospitable temperatures = malnutrition and death. 

According to this source, the total Amerindian population of what is now the United States in 1500 was about 1,894,350! [Source: http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/110482975/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 ]

Since quite a few people here get their news from a slanted source, al jazeera, or both, I thought I would throw in some research and truth to the matter, not just want some anti-semites want the news to say.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/turkey/7798493/Gaza-flotilla-attack-Turkish-activists-killed-in-raid-wanted-to-be-martyrs.html

Since some of them won't believe that link, since it's not a conspiracy theory, here's a video:

http://dailyradar.com/beltwayblips/video/gaza-flotilla-participants-aspire-to-die-as-martyrs/

Have you heard of Hamas? They are linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. Did you know that many of the members on the floatilla were part of the MB? Probably not. That or they ignore that fact, because it doesn't fit with their ideology.

* The Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas, founded in 1987 in Gaza, is a wing of the Brotherhood, formed
out of Brotherhood-affiliated charities and social institutions that had gained a strong foothold among the local
population.

* Simply put, the Brotherhood saw the flotilla as a public relations weapon that could be used to assist their
fellow Ikhwan.

* The flotilla was organized in large part by a radical Turkish Islamist organization named IHH (Islan Haklary Ve Hurriyetleri Vakfi). The IHH, in turn, is part of a Saudi-based umbrella group called the Union of Good, which was created by Hamas. The U.S. Treasury Department designated the Union of Good a terrorist organization in 2008. Of course, Hamas itself was designated a terrorist organization many years ago.

In other words, the IHH is an offshoot of the Union of Good, which is in turn an offshoot of the Brotherhood -- as is Hamas. It is a matter of basic logic, then, that if the IHH was one of the prime movers behind the flotilla then that means the Brotherhood itself was.

* Two of the passengers, as revealed by the indispensable MEMRI organization, are members of the Muslim Brotherhood’s bloc in the Egyptian parliament. One of the two, Muhammad al Baltaji, is the deputy secretary general of the Muslim Brotherhood’s parliamentary contingent.

MEMRI quotes al Baltaji as saying recently, “A nation that excels at dying will be blessed by Allah with a life of dignity and with eternal paradise.”

Al Baltaji also explained the flotilla’s purpose this way: “The flotilla participants have two aims: to reach Gaza and break the siege, and to denounce Israel if it prevents the flotilla from entering Gaza, even at the cost of martyrdom or imprisonment.”

* Three of the flotilla’s passengers were members of the Yemeni Islah party, which is led by the aforementioned Zindani. Sheikh Zindani is a globally designated terrorist and a longtime benefactor of Osama bin Laden.

* The Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood was represented too. Again, we can turn to MEMRI to learn that at least four Jordanian Brotherhood members, including high-ranking officials, were among the flotilla’s passengers.

MEMRI quotes one of them, Salam al Falahat, the “general guide of the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan from 2006 to 2008” as saying last year: ""We in the Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan see Palestine as part of the Islamic and Arab land that must not be relinquished – on the contrary, defending it is a national and jurisprudential obligation... We see Hamas movement in Palestine as standing at the head of the project of the Arab and Islamic liberation for which the Muslim Brotherhood calls... The Muslim Brotherhood supports Hamas and every Arab resistance movement in the region that works for liberation.""

The United Front of Anti-semitic Friends continue to cry propaganda (along with their bigoted and hateful little Hitler and oven jokes), yet the propaganda machine at work is the MB.

Again, nothing excuses Israel shooting these people when they could have been subdued in other ways, but nothing excuses the extremists here from excusing terrorists. Yes, terrorists.

Do I agree with the blockade? It's a tricky subject, for safety reasons yes, for huminitarian reasons, no.

But do I agree with people car bombing, scudding, and running blockades so they can aid folks doing just this? No. Certainly there may have been aid, but aid for people who, well, condone terrorism to take a place that isn't theirs in the name of religion and control.

Can they co-exist? It would be nice. But it's hard to co-exist with someone when they only want all of your people dead, yet they make a stink when people who made martyr videos, claimed they were going to run the blockade and might die, and filled out their wills before embarking on the boat run into trouble. Everyone on that floatilla knew what they were doing, where they were going, etc. It's just sad they had to die.

If I know the cops are going to be blocking off the president's visit, and I run at the them with sticks, pipes, and knives. And worse yet, I try to take their weapons. What do you think my chances are? I guess I am just sick of people bashing Israel because it's the cool thing to do, yet they say nothing about people who blow up children with car bombs and release youtube videos of beheadings.

,5,"I'll try and answer all of these but sorry if it gets a bit rambly:

* There is some difficulty in determining what starts the 5d &amp; 6d series. Since as you correctly noted La and Ac have no f-electrons it would be wrong to call them f-elements and put them at the start of the f-block but at the same time they don't really fit correctly in Group 3 if you take them out of the f-block (as in [here](http://www.chemistry-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/periodic-table4.png)). If you look at periodic trends (atmoic radius, I.E, Melting Point) it would make more sense for Group 3 to be: Sc, Y, Lu, Lr as putting La in place of Lu throws the trends off when compared to later groups (Gp 14: Ti, Zr, Hf). So La and Ac don't really belong in either which is why I think they are quite interchangable. See Duckroll's post and [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table_%28wide%29) for more.

* I just had to double-back and check electronic compositions and you are right, Th does not have f-electrons either. I can't really shed any light on why it appears in the f-block other than it needed to go there in order to make everything else fit. The periodic table is more of a compilation of different facts and figures, the underlying notion being electronic structure but certain things get shifted about to fit with the observed trends in more established areas of the table.

* The seemigly random electronic configuration of the f-elements does have good reason and I'll try to be concise. For the Lanthanides I assume you're happy with the Aufbau principle predicting Ce as 4f*`2`*6s*`2`* so the trend is to fill f all the way up to Eu 4f*`7`*6s*`2`*. Gd is much like Cr where you see a preference for 5 d-electrons. In this case 7-electrons are a nice stable configuration as half of the shell is filled and no electrons have to be paired in the same orbital at an energy cost; so for Gd, instead of having 8 electrons in 4f, one electron is moved to the 5d orbital producing a more stable configuration 4f*`7`*5d*`1`*6s*`2`*. For Tb, two electrons in d would have more of an energy penalty than two paired f-electrons so it goes back to filling f all the way to the end where Lu is 4f*`14`*5d*`1`*6s*`2`* and it is here why you can see it follows similar trends to the lighter d*`1`* elements and vies with La for placement under them.

* The Actinides get more complicated as the nuclei are now massive. 5f orbitals undergo indirect orbital expansion as a result of the s (and p) orbitals contracting due to their exposure to the massive charges on the nuclei causing them to approach the speed of light. This raises the energy of the 5f orbital therefore lowers the 5f-6d separation which is why at the start of the Actinide series there is 1 d-electron instead of an extra f-electron. As for Lr, my guess is that 7p is simply lower in energy than 6d at this point so the extra electron goes in that (possibly due to the orbital expansion/contraction again: weaker contraction for p and weaker expansion for d but it might be enough to flip the energies of 7p*`1`* and 6d*`1`*)

,5,"""White privilege"" is the idea that because European, and specifically Anglo-Saxon, people conquered the world a couple centuries back, they established a certain socio-economic infrastructure that favored white people. This is a fact; in practically every area conquered by Europeans, Europeans were constantly placed higher in importance and status than the native population.

How this applies to you and me is this: As a result of this system, and as a result of the legal, institutionalized racism that finally died a mere 40 years ago, there are dramatically more white people in positions of social, economic, and political power than non-white people. 

People naturally prefer being around others who look, think, and act like them. People in power tend to be white people. Thus, all things being equal, a white applicant is more likely to be given a job, given a loan, or given a renter's contract than a nonwhite person, simply because the employer, banker, or landlord in question is most likely also white. That's white privilege: because you are white, you have a statistically better chance at improving your lot in life than someone who is not white.

Affirmative action policies are an attempt to mitigate white privilege by forcing employer, bankers, and landlords to choose nonwhite people over white people where all things are equal. Theoretically, that leads to an equalization of statistics, allowing nonwhite people to become employers, bankers, and landlords, and in turn favor their own races where all things are equal. Realistically, however, forcing anyone to do anything breeds agitation, and affirmative action hires rarely advance very far in a company. It also breeds the contempt of the nonwhite employers, bankers, and landlords who are now dealing with outside perceptions that they are underqualified for their positions.

Interracial relations are suffering, nonwhites are demanding the same social treatment whites get, whites keep supporting pro-civil-rights laws and don't know what nonwhite people are so upset about, because while white privilege is glaringly obvious to nonwhites, white people in general are completely unaware that it exists.

It's not like we get a club card that says ""good for 10% off all cost-of-living expenses, one free job, and one house in a curiously minority-free neighborhood."" or anything; that's just what tends to happen, because de facto racism is the hardest to fight.",pics,0,0,True,5,1426331513,False,Sceradin,,c0rflyk,False,0,t5_2qh0u,1275691949,,t1_c0rflyk,t1_c0rfizk,t3_cbhuf

&gt; The students start each morning with a pledge to ""Be prepared, to struggle for the cause of Communism!"" Look up the Young Pioneers.

Contrary to popular belief, students in China are NOT indoctrinated. Most teachers encourage free thinking and insight into other nations and cultures. Knowledge is a positive trait in China, and students are self-motivated to learn. There is especially an emphasis placed on individuality, individual skill and ability - if you're good at art, teachers will encourage you to do something design-related. If you like music, teachers will allow you into the music room in your spare time. There is no one dominant religion in China - in fact, there is barely any religion in school, as students are given more leeway to 'believe what they want'.


Compare this with the States, where parents, trustees, and 'high-ups' in the education system are pushing for the teaching of intelligent design in science.


Indeed, I find this aspect of the US pretty hard to understand.


&gt; They salute the flag every morning as it is raised, every class is tinged with revisionism, patriotism and lies.


In boarding schools (attended by the majority of mainland Chinese), students actually start each morning with exercise. They run track, play tennis, do cardio, etc. - for about an hour or so before singing the national anthem. Wait: so whereas Chinese kids are encouraged to lead healthy lifestyles, American kids are encouraged to be able to recognize the face of Ronald McDonald years before they recognize that of the American president?


&gt; As a nation they hate the Japanese, the French, the Tibetans...

A stereotype only applicable to the older members of society. Anyone under 40 (who receives an education) does not harbour any more animosity for the Japanese/French/Tibetans than Americans do Muslims.


&gt; and they don't even have universal health care in a ""communist"" country.

You said that personal anecdotes are not evidence, while posting an article which was nothing but personal anecdotes.  I pointed this out.  

As to the stats in the article:

&gt; Per capita income is a valid economy wide statistic, and supporters of poor Scandinavia always use it to show the alleged prosperity of people there. I was simply doing the same.

Very well.  Norway has a higher per capita income.  [Wikipedia](http://bit.ly/193E8H)  Look back at the article and note that the article *completely excluded* this fact and instead presented statistics from other countries (in a study conducted by a libertarian think tank), and then compared those countries with his personal anecdotes about how Norway has stingy bartenders.

&gt; ""It (a study by KPMG) indicated that when disposable income was adjusted for cost of living, Scandinavians were the poorest people in Western Europe.""

The only thing this concludes is that Scandinavia taxes much higher (disposable income=after tax income) than the rest of Europe, which isn't disputed or terribly interesting, since everyone knows that.

&gt; ""While the private-consumption figure for the United States was $32,900 per person, the countries of Western Europe (again excepting Luxembourg, at $29,450) ranged between $13,850 and $23,500, with Norway at $18,350.""

Does the above figure mean that Norway is less well off?  Not really, just that less of Norway's (higher) GDP per capita is spent on private consumption.  America spends more money on cars, household appliances, etc., while Norwegians spend less.  This could be explained in any number of ways: America has a culture of conspicuous consumption while Norwegians are more modest.  It perhaps simply means that this is part of the tradeoff for a more generous social safety net, universal and cheaper per capita healthcare (and better performance on most all measures of public health), a secondary educational system that performs better than America's, and a much cheaper university system.

That's a myth that's been soundly debunked time and time again. The Romans *never* had a mass depopulation of Judea.

[The kingdom that *was* destroyed, and its population scattered was northern kingdom of Israel in 800 BC. The Babylonians destroyed it and much of its population went east into Central Asia.] None of those displaced people went west into Europe. None. Zero. Zilch. Babylonia absorbed them, so the tidal pull was toward the east. (Europe, at the time, was a backwater.) Babylonia, however, left the kingdom to the south, Judea, intact. Modern Jews get their name from the term ""Jude,"" which is short for ""Judean"". They are descended from the Judeans, *not* from the Israelites.

Which makes it ironic that they decided to call the modern nation created in 1948 ""Israel"".

* The awkward naming probably had more to do with the stigma ""Jew"" had acquired in Europe in the 18th and 19th Centuries. Jews started calling themselves ""Hebrew"" and naming institutions accordingly like ""The Young Men's Hebrew Association"" or ""Hebrew National Franks"". They shied away from the term ""Jew"". Hence when Zionists wanted to re-create a homeland, they shrank away from Judea [which would have been more accurate] and decided to go with the name ""Israel"".

But Israel and Judea were starkly different cases: Judea [unlike Israel] was *never* depopulated. There was no diaspora after Rome conquered the region. According to just about every mainstream historian and geneticist, the population remained intact, converting to Christianity under Rome and then to Islam in the Middle Ages. In other words, the ""dirty Muslim Palestinians"" are *actually* the Jews, who never left the land.

Certainly everything you said is true of the past but you really don't appreciate the speed at which China has changed.

Just sent a text to my wife to check on the pledge thing  ** edit she just replied and said they don't (she is a form teacher in a middle school) **,  I've never heard it myself or seen saluting the flag, but there are 100s of thousands of schools in China, so it is quite likely different things are common place in different areas. To be honest I wouldn't be too surprised about saluting the flag, but these days China does not promote the communist philosophy. I would be very surprised if the word is even used in schools except as in a historical context, everything is ""Socialism"" these days. 

I have seen plenty of Chinese text-books. No they are not all tinged with revisionism. Most of them are just text books, but sadly some of their accounts of modern history differ in places from what I believe is true. However many Chinese are at least aware of this. 

You would probably be surprised to learn that there is a lot less censorship in China than you probably think there is. Yes there are Internet blocks, (reddit is not blocked obviously) but I have pretty much never found a major foreign news story that wasn't known to my colleagues. Domestic news stories will get local coverage but may not get into the national press. Nowadays there a many more newspaper stories that are critical of government at least at the local level. I was even watching a major television drama where one of the characters, a good guy, was a corrupt city official who knew he was going probably to prison for taking bribes from a construction company. It was set in a fictional city but the back-drop was Shanghai. That drama also had a couple of really positive foreign characters, who spoke good Chinese and were generous and understanding of Chinese culture.

As a nation strong dislike of the Japanese is common, but I know plenty of Japanese people in China and the locals treat them politely and with respect like they would any other visitor. The reasons for the dislike of the Japanese as a country (rather than individuals) is the same as many Europeans still vocally hate the Germans. Simply the Japanese were the aggressors in a very brutal war against many of their neighbors. The difference between the Germans and the Japanese has been that when the Germans apologized for the war, they really sound like they meant it. The Japanese have technically apologized many times but if you read the text there is nothing along the lines of ""we are really sorry that we cut open pregnant women in front of their families, performed vivisection experiments on prisoners, and widely used sex slaves"". Their apologies are dry and technical. These omissions have caused ill feeling towards japan and not just in China. I have actually got several Japanese friends who came over here to teach, sort of to help make amends, but I have also met Japanese people in China who basically say their country never did anything wrong.
There are old people tottering along the street outside my window who were eye-witnesses to what Japan did in this area (I live near Nanjing)

Finally not all Chinese hate the Japanese, plenty of young Chinese learn Japanese, are interested in the culture and think history should be left in the past.

The Tibetan issue is complicated, anyone who thinks it is simple is a fool. I won't discuss it here in detail but I can guarantee that Tibet won't get independence, and the more other countries put pressure on China the worse the situation will get. Can you image a free Tibet that allowed America to place a missile base on the Tibetan plateau? I am pretty sure the Chinese can. This is only one small aspect of a complex story that started with the Yuan dynasty. You are not ever going to convince a Chinese person that Tibet hasn't been part of their country for 700years. I have heard all the arguments, I am quite sympathetic to the Tibetan cause, but in the end it will have no effect on anything. This is the hardest brick wall in history there is no moving it.

Now on to something I know more about. Employment law, I know about this because in 2008 I was running my own company and then the Employment law changed in China to dramatically increase workers rights.
(wikipedia_article)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Employment_Law]

The law could be improved, but it contains some important provisions. For example employers must pay severance pay of one month's pay for every year worked when laying off workers. Contracts must specify health-care provisions, public insurance contributions etc etc. Courts will enforce these laws and many cases have been successfully brought against companies. I strongly suggest you research Chinese employment law before you say there are no workers rights.

On health care, China is a relatively poor country with 1.3billion citizens. It will be sometime before a free health-care system would be possible. However laws are in place and actively enforced to ensure that the price of important drugs and critical health-care procedures (Like maternity services) are capped to ensure they remain within the reach of even the poorest. 

I have fallen Ill here a couple of times, and a course of injections, anti-virals and drips over a period of a week, set me back $60. China is a nation of savers and I can guarantee 99% of the population have enough put by to cover common medical emergencies. In China you can always find a friend, or family member to lend you money, (for medicine, to buy a house whatever) people always help out their family and school-friends and always pay back the money as soon as they can, you would be considered a pretty worthless individual if you didn't. 

I'll also say that medical services are abundant here. I live in a small city in an province most people have never heard of, but there are community medical centers everywhere for common procedures like dispensing antibiotics. There are 5-6 major public hospitals and then there are a whole bunch of private hospitals. This is not a major city or a rich area but I can confidently say that health care is well within reach of most people who need it. I would certainly say that the situation is nowhere near as bad as you are portraying.

China is a very fast developing country. Quality of life is improving in all areas, I hear well informed discussions wherever I go. I see a lot of spending of public project that benefit people. My city just got a massive new park and an opera house is being built opposite Walmart.

All I am trying to get across is that your views are out of date and need constant revision. I would be happy to answer your questions based on my personal experiences.

,5,"I'm deeply sympathetic to the Jewish plight in Europe. Because of it, I fall on the side of the assimilationist Jews from the 1920s, rather than with the anti-assimilationist zealots who wanted to preach Jewish separatism. European Jews—despite cultural propaganda to the contrary—were *not* that unusual in Eastern Europe. Lots of Balkan and Slavic groups entered Europe from the Middle East. Bulgarians, for instance, came from Central Asia. Croats came from an Iranian tribe called the Hvrati. Slavs are a hybrid of aboriginal Balkan groups and Central Asian nomads who only entered Europe circa 9,000 BC.

   So European Jews being a blend of ""Middle Eastern"" and indigenous Europeans was *not* a strange historical occurrence. 

   The only thing that made things difficult for Jews was that—unlike all the other groups—they refused to assimilate to wider European culture.

   The average Serb has *just* as much ""Near Eastern"" DNA as a Jew. So why aren't Serbs treated as shabbily?

   The average Romanian has a boatload of Middle Eastern haplogroup J2. So why aren't they as despised?

   The answer: They embraced the status quo of European culture, left the majority of their Near Eastern customs behind and assimilated.

   A Jewish friend of mine said on the subject of bacon: ""My rabbi said that eating kosher isn't really that important, as dietary concerns go. It's more just about reminding yourself that you're different. You're a Jew.""

   And therein lies 99% of the troubles besetting Eastern European Jewish culture: the obsession on a perceived difference, when in reality 90% of the other surrounding nationalities have just as much ""non-European DNA"".

   The Jews exalted their perceived originality to a sort of virtue—even at the cost of ostracism. 

   And that's the saddest part: So much of the psychological feeling of ostracism, of ""otherness"" stems from a perception that Jews and Jews alone are ""different,"" ""racially exotic,"" etc., when in reality they were formed by the same historical processes that created modern Croats, Serbs, Romanians, etc.

As to the Khazar question you brought up—

Genetics has largely vindicated it. Ashkenazic Jews have large presences of haplogroups R1a and G, which are *exactly* the haplogroups associated with Central Asian tribes, one of which were the Khazars. (Scyths and Tocharians were others.) In fact, the term ""Ashkenazic"" comes from the name Scyth. The name occurs in Assyrian in the form Aškuzai or Iškuzai (""Scythian""). It provided the source for biblical Hebrew ""Ashkenaz"".

   The Scyths were a fair-skinned, red-haired people who originated in the Black Sea region and made inroads into Eastern Europe, circa 100 BC.

   They were an ""Indo-European"" people. 

   From the larger umbrella term of ""Indo-European,"" they were what archaeologists call a ""Northern-Iranid"" group. Southern Iranids survive today as ""Iranians"". The Northern Iranids were absorbed by the Slavs and became the modern nations of Ossetia, Russia, Poland, etc.

   Later tribes from Central Asia came in, too: the Khazars were one. Like their fellow Scyths, they were red-haired, rode horses and had DNA haplogroup R1a.

   Modern Bulgarians are descended from the Khazars. It's an over-generalization, but many people say that ""Khazars who converted to Christianity are called Bulgarians; Khazars who converted to Judaism are called Ashkenazic Jews"".

   My point in this rant?

   There was nothing special—or even unusual—in the historical processes that created Eastern European Jews. Like most Balkan types, they're a blend of ""Near Eastern, Slav and Iranid"".

In the end, the only thing that alienated them, ostracized them was their own willingness to play into a larger fictitious narrative of ""separateness,"" ""otherness,"" mostly taken from the Talmud and the Old Testament.

""Saeb Erekat in Tel Aviv: Optimistic about talks"" - Jerusalem Post (5/17/10)

' “The Americans cannot make peace for us. Americans cannot make the concessions that are required by Palestinians or Israelis. Americans cannot make decisions for Palestinians and Israelis,” said Erekat. “Many people say that the proximity talks after 19 years is a regression, that Palestinians not sitting face-to-face with Israelis is a step backward.

' “That can be argued, but another argument in the science of negotiations is that proximity is when two sides exhaust everything they have – they have turned over every stone, they cannot conclude what they are trying to achieve. Then comes a third party to do four tasks: to go between, to facilitate, to arbitrate and to mediate,” he asserted.

' “In the end, though, it is up to the two parties to make the decision,” he said, declaring that “the Palestinian leadership, Mahmoud Abbas, is fully ready for what it takes to achieve the endgame.”

' ...

' Responding to a question asking why the Palestinians required Arab approval to enter proximity talks, Erekat said the Palestinians did not and never would seek Arab permission, but wanted the support of its neighbors, chiefly Jordan and Egypt.

' Erekat said the PA would not declare a Palestinian state unilaterally, but that everything was currently in motion for having the necessary institutions in place. He said Prime Minister Salam Fayyad’s state-building plan was also Abbas’s plan and that they hoped to receive formal recognition of statehood from all the countries in the European Union.

' When asked if the PA would recognize Israel as a Jewish state, Erekat shot back, “Why are you asking me to join the Zionist movement? I don’t want to be a Zionist... Your name is the State of Israel. I recognize you as the State of Israel. If you want to call yourselves the Eternal, United, Historical, Biblical, Hebrew Nation of Jews from now to the future, who cares?” '

,1,"&gt;Marry entered English in about 1300 as marien `to give in marriage.' This came from Old French marier, from Latin maritare `wed, marry,' from maritus `married man or husband.' It is thought that maritus might have its source in a participle that meant `provided with a bride or young woman,' from Indo-European *mer- or *mor-.

&gt;**Marriage also entered English about 1300** as mariage from Old French mariage. That was formed from the verb marier plus the suffix -age. That suffix is used to form a noun from a verb. It comes from Old French - age.

So the english word, even the french word, did not precede Church and State. But then, it wasn't appointed by them either. I'm not sure why you would make this point, however, since you just stated ""Marriage belongs to the Church."" 

Regardless, that point is now moot, since the word ""Marriage"" is used in codified law. It is that definition which we must consider. Either the word definition must be understood to be in line with the law, or every law that has that word must be edited.

The concept represented by ""marriage"" predates church and state, which does not support your statement that ""marriage"" is of the Church and Civil Union is of the State. It was and still is a social contract of the group that recognizes previously unrelated persons as primary family.

,17,"This is very long, but it is my best explanation:

Americans love to say, ""you can't *generalize*,"" but there are some fair generalizations to be made. Right wing populism plays well to certain segments of American society, for various reasons. Partly it comes down to the politics of keeping your piece of the pie. We've had the same government for 250 years, and during that time we've been mostly wealthy and prosperous on the home front. There have always been problems but generally things have been good for most people most of the time. This has especially been true in the post war period. Thus Americans have a natural fear of changing anything too much, too quickly, even if that change is something that people in other countries might think is a no-brainer. Our nationalist tendencies probably come from our experience of the war. Our WWII experience, in contrast to Europe's, was one of using military might for the glorious triumph of good over evil, as Hollywood would put it. Our casualties were relatively light, and there was little suffering in the homeland to turn Americans off to militarism. This mentality was extended through the Cold War when opposition to the Soviets was cast as a battle between godless communist tyranny, and ""American values"" like freedom, democracy, and so on. Our opposition to communism goes a ways towards explaining the distrust of leftist politics, since in the Cold War leftism was associated with Communism, which was seen as anti-American. You can see politicians on the right today trying to cast Islamic terrorists as the new Communist menace, since having an enemy is good politics for them.  In addition to this is the natural cheer leading that comes with being a superpower. Some people like the idea of ruling the world, and they aren't ashamed of it. The attitude is similar to one found in Britain during the glory days of it's empire. 

Having said all that though, one of the most important factors is the influence of racial politics, especially in one part of America: The South. The South has always been defined by race politically. Whites vote for one party, blacks the other. Its tribal politics, same as how in African countries each tribe votes for their guys no matter what. Before the 1964 voting rights act Southern Whites universally voted for Democrats out of their bitterness over the Civil War. (They have looong memories.) They weren't even conservative back then; they heavily supported the party's left wing agenda. After civil rights though, the Republicans started signalling that they were the white man's party.  White Southerners started voting Republican. No matter what. Economic politics took a backseat to racial identity politics. 

The result of this is that you have a large impregnable conservative voting block tilting the country to the right. If you look at the voting patterns of all other regions of the country they are quite similar to other countries like Canada, for example, in their political orientation. The effect of the South's conservativism is amplified by an archaic 250 year old political system which empowers rural states and makes obstructionism easy. It takes 60 votes in the Senate to do anything remember, and Idaho gets as many votes as California despite having 1% of its population. 

This built in political advantage for conservatives does one thing: it empowers conservatives. Republicans are continually able to block progress even when in the minority, and in the end Americans wind up seeing the government as the enemy rather than an ally. They believe that government intrinsically *can't* work, and they turn to libertarianism as the only recourse.

Money pours out of every fucking orifice and there are even more things to spend all of that money on and the tolerance for any kind of lifestyle, normal and bizarre that you want to indulge. You don't have to be smart, just be willing to work hard and you can rake cash in. Don't have cash now? Fear not, there's plenty of cheap credit available for you to hang yourself with.

Immigrants come from the world over to bust their asses, with no written English skills and set up small businesses that cater our every whim and perversion and they make fortunes.

Or you can be smart and work a little and still earn a fortune too. Whatever.

Our cars are fast and dangerous and spacious and we give licenses to anyone. Or maybe you don't want to drive ever. There are farmers that drive everywhere and city-slickers that walk everywhere. And everything in between.

Want to own a farm? Sure, have ten thousand acres and host your own demolition derbys with the rest of your redneck neighbors in Alabama. Want a shoebox apartment and a sex and the city, fashion and trendy restaurant obsessed heroin chic lifestyle? Oh man do we have a place for you.

Want to be a single mom? Nobody even notices. Want to start a family with two moms and two dads and have twisted four-somes? You don't get lynched, surprisingly.

Want to not spend your Sunday in church or at home with nothing to do because everything's closed? Welcome, sinner, the bars open at 8am. We only pretend to be religious.

Our pro-family values Republicans are all closet ass-pounding homosexuals and our moralist whining environmentalist crybaby Democrats have mansions with heated pools. TV coverage of all of this hypocrisy is endless and hilarious.

Want to name your children retarded names, yeah, we'll let you name your idiot kids Dweezil and Guthrie. Go nuts.

Want to be gay? Have we got the places for you. New York, San Francisco, Austin, TX (or San Antonio, or Dallas, etc.) will all let you get your freak on.

Want to sleep during the day and work nights? Sure, enjoy 24 hour dry-cleaning in Vegas.

Jewish? No sweat. Chinese restaurants are open on Christmas.

Concerned about the coming alien transmutation event foretold by the voices in your head? Start your doomsday cult today! Not only won't we interfere, we'll give you tax breaks.

Like Carribean warm? Live in Florida. Like the freezing cold for some reason? Live in Minneapolis.

Too lazy to get out of your air conditioned SUV? No sweat. Drive-throughs are everywhere.

Vegetarian? Yeah, not only won't we murder you for being a retard, we'll cater to your needs by selling you $15 mushroom burgers. And they'll be delicious.

The one thing in the article I thought was ridiculous though was his discussion of environmental damage and oil dependence. This is common throughout the world.

I've lived in Mexico and Central America. They are wonderful places to live until you have a problem that involves the state. But obviously, the U.S. isn't the only place with a functional government.  

Singapore has a functional government but a repressive one. Most of the time, you will have a better life in such places if you never run afoul of the state. And it is easier not to if you retain your American passport. 

It is great to be an American living in Mexico. It is great to be a rich Mexican. It is not that great to be a poor Mexican and more Mexicans are poor rather than rich. That's all I mean, really.

,2,"You're completely misunderstanding the word 'socialism'; then again most people do. That's because when most people say 'socialism' they think of the Marxist-Leninist consensus. Powerful vanguard parties enforcing dictatorial rule on a population stripped of the means of production by the state. Or, they are thinking of a western european welfare state. An untenable arrangement involving a government which takes money from it's citizens ostensibly to fund programs for the poor and the needy but in reality wastes it on hookers and blow until the state is ready to collapse.

The word ""socialism"" was originally intended to refer to a system of economics in which there were no monetary transactions (Utopian socialism, see also Star Trek). Producers would focus on 'use-value' rather than 'exchange-value'. From this grew more revolutionary branches such as Communism of the Marxist forms, which stated that capitalism (a term coined by Marx to derisively refer to the status quo of large hierarchical corporations, and subsequently and unironically used by confused economists ever since) is something that would eventually disappear and be supplanted if only by natural forces. This didn't happen and we got Lenin's version, which then proceeded to tack on a bunch of other stuff about things like vanguard parties. That grew into the Soviet Union which then proceeded to label socialism and communism as horrible excuses for state dictatorship and non-money fascism.

Now, with that out of the way I am happy to say that any socialist commune would probably not end up like either of those things. Because it is a *voluntary* commune, the leaders of such are much more likely to treat it with respect rather than loot the treasury.

,1,"First of all I am sorry if you got an impression that I was disgracing all these cultures by calling them racist, Injunteller here claimed that Indian society is the most elitist, racist, caste restricted society, I was just pointing it out, that only white Europeans have the white guilt, only they act in a culture/race sensitive manner, because otherwise I have found almost all the non-white cultures to be the very same.

No I haven't been to all over the world, but I know a lot of people, have a lot of friends, and family living in these places. I personally have been to middle east, and have two cousins living in there for many years now. I cannot be more sure about middle east than any other place.

My roommate last month applied for a job in Dubai, he was offered X amount of money(he used his Anglocized name and has an American accent), lots of negotiations went over the phone. Eventually, he submitted his photo and stuff, and they found out that he was Indian, suddenly the job offer was dropped. Now I am generally the last person to really believe the claims of racism as an excuse for incompetence, but last week another Dubai vendor found my roommate, for the same job, he knew that he was Indian, so the started offer made to him was X/3.

So yeah I don't doubt that you found Middle Easterners to be very generous and hospitable people in the world, now lets move on to the next question, are you white?

Anyways, nobody in Dubai really screams 'Go back to where you came from', or 'Traitor', at you while driving by(as it generally happens to me like 3-4 times a year here in America), but again, if you are white, I really doubt your authority on understanding racism or knowing how much racism exists in America or in middle east. But, in America generally saying or doing any such thing is mostly socially unacceptable, whereas in other cultures this doesn't exist.

For example back in India I was always taught that we got independence from British, because India belonged to Indians and they were foreigners, although its not said anywhere, we all clearly understood, that India didn't belong to them because they were Europeans(as in White). This implied racism is never explicitly said anywhere, in fact its only recently when I understood and classified it as racism.

I flinch every time someone I know use the term 'chink' or 'chinky' for Asians, I recently kicked out a roommate, and stopped being friends with him, because he couldn't just get it off his tongue. Mostly because this word is very common in India, I once told this to an American friend and she was appalled and said that Indians are damn racist.

But the fact is China invaded India in 1962, and there are some huge border disputes between the two countries, there is no white guilt there, that makes Indians feel bad about using such a term when you point it out that its not a good term. Only anger!

About your GDP point, I am sorry, but quoting what their govts did is not even remotely the same what people want or do. Coz technically we have a black president, but that hardly is conclusive about anything in America.

Another thing is, you are implying that if they were racist they wouldn't donate money to people of other races they hate, but there is another truth up there, despite of the fact that Chinese govt invaded India, if there is a massive earthquake in China, some of the massive donations of resources will to there from India.

Lemme summarize my point here, I am trying to explain it to Injunfeller that not just India but white european/americans will notice almost all the countries and societies having a lot more racism, castism or elitism, than in America, the reason is, because of lack of white guilt.

The reason why all these Indian assholes in this thread are dissing Nikki Haley for marrying a white guy, because they have no white guilt, on the other hand, if they were white, and complaint about a white woman marrying an Indian guy, everything would change, they would know it themselves what an awful and upsetting thing they are saying.

,2,"&gt; Wrong. The article contains data that is not anecdotal. Why lie like this?

The article's non-anecdotal data doesn't support the article's conclusions, but it's interspersed with anecdotes to mislead you about what the data is actually saying.  The article is dishonest; I suppose I should have parenthetically added (practically) to my sentence, because that's what I meant.

&gt; Higher than what?

Higher than the USA, higher than the rest of Western Europe (minus Luxembourg).  I provided a link, please click it again.  This time note that this is GDP per capital (PPP), which is the GDP per capita measure [*adjusted for the cost of living*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity).  If you look at the [unadjusted (nominal) figure](http://bit.ly/NOQu7), Norway's GDP per capita figure is *double* that of the United States.

You claimed that this is an acceptable statistic to use, so there you go.  

&gt; After cost of living adjustments, Scandinavia is the poorest in western Europe.

No, that's not true.  The article misleads you into thinking that, but that sentence was only referencing disposable (after tax) income.  There's no question that Scandinavia has high taxes, but that doesn't equate with being 'poor' or the 'poorest'.  You'd have to provide statistics on the value of the social services that go right back to the people and then make comparisons to reach that conclusion (or just look at GDP/capita, which doesn't show Scandinavians as the poorest).  The article doesn't do that, and neither do you.

&gt; It certainly shows that people of Norway have less choice, and hence less ability to actually make their lives better off. Remember, money spent by the individual themselves is always better spent and thus higher utility than money spent by somebody else on the individual, which is always less utility.

Disposable income is an incomplete measure of choice, and consequently, utility.  Compare Norway with the United States.  The US is taxed less and has more disposable income, which you equate with choice.  Taxes are determined by government, which is determined by democratic elections.  In Norway, there are seven political parties currently represented; in America, two.  Politically, Norway has more choice, and Norway also has higher voter turnout.  So, Norway has more political choice.

When you look at something like health care, Norway has made the political choice to provide it universally.  In the US, that choice is not a politically viable political choice; not only are there less parties to choose from, but industry interests get a disproportionate choice in the matter.  Because of costs, health care is often not even an economic choice: [42% of people in the US forgo needed medical service for chronic conditions because of cost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_the_United_States#Coverage).

Even ignoring those matters, you could start from the assumption that the utility is the same in each country and conclude that Norway's collective preferences are simply more risk averse, preferring a stronger safety net, while the US is willing to risk medical bankruptcy and so on in exchange for higher disposable income.

&gt; Suppose you have $100. You can either spend it yourself, or I can take it away from you and spend it on what I believe is good for you. It is a universal truth that your utility will be higher if you spent your money than if I spent it for you on what I believe is good for you.

Gettit?

Once more for luck?

Any country has a right to close its border. Its not always moral, and I dont Agree with Egpyt stance but I understand it. They have made a choice and have that right. What they cannot do is close off another countries borders. That's called a blockade. That is what Israel is doing.
That is why Israel is responsible for Gaza.

Another angle. Three houses in a row. The center one is Gaza.

The one on the left. ""The center one cannot pass across my yard to get out.""
The one on the right. ""The center one cannot pass across my yard, Nor can it use its front or rear doors to get out"".

The one on the right is the one blockading the center one.

Has that sunk in?

A few details for those that want to look into this deeper.

the border agreement between Israel and Egypt regarding the Gaza and Egpyt border is very tight and monitored by the US and tied to $1.3B of aid the US give Egypt.  
There isn't much point in Israel blocking all access in and out of GAZA then leaving the Egypt /Gaza border wide open is there? IT was tied up before Israel left GAZA. 
 

[**A New Reality on the Egypt-Gaza Border**](
http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=2374)


On September 1, 2005, following lengthy negotiations, Egypt and Israel signed the Agreed Arrangements Regarding the Deployment of a Designated Force of Border Guards along the Border in the Rafah Area (the Agreed Arrangements). This agreement was designed to enable Israel to evacuate the Philadelphia corridor, an eight-mile (thirteen-kilometer) military zone along the Gaza-Egypt border, through the deployment of Egyptian border patrol forces to the Egyptian side of the border in order to prevent smuggling into Gaza. In eighty-three clauses, the agreement describes the mission, weaponry, infrastructure, and obligations of the parties


Whats more [as this congressional report mentions ](http://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL34346.pdf) Israel has not only exaggerated the threat posed by weapons smuggling, but is deliberately acting to “sabotage” U.S.-Egyptian relations by demanding that the United States condition its annual $1.3 billion in military assistance on Egypt’s efforts to thwart smuggling
A bit more info: [The Rafah Terminal Crossing](http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL34346.pdf)
The Rafah crossing point is the only non-Israeli army-controlled access point
for Palestinians to leave Gaza. When Israel unilaterally withdrew from the Gaza Strip
in 2005, Secretary of State Rice helped broker an agreement (“The Agreement on
Movement and Access”) between Israel, Egypt, and the Palestinian Authority to
provide Gazans access through the Rafah terminal. Israel agreed to allow the
European Union to maintain a Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM) to monitor the
Rafah crossing. Without a physical presence on the border, Israel monitored the
checkpoint using closed-circuit cameras. **Most importantly, Israel retained the power
to open and close the crossing based on its assessment of the security situation.**
After Hamas took over the Gaza Strip in June 2007, Egypt worked with Israel
to close the Rafah crossing. According to the last EUBAM factsheet, “Since Corporal
Gilad Shalit was captured [by Hamas] on 25 June 2006, the Rafah Crossing Point
(RCP) has been closed for normal operations and open on an exceptional basis only.

Complete and utter bullshit. First, how can you quantify racism? The only difference may be the level of blatancy and obviousness. As for white guilt one could argue it has very little to do with actually objecting to racism or helping disenfranchised minorities and everything to do with demonstrating innocence.  Racism is not fashionable and white guilt leaves no room for moral choice; it does not depend on the goodwill or genuine decency of people.

This made me think about the new scientist article (dated 2007) and I was disappointed to see that the International Livestock Research Institute is still talking about the same stuff now (2010).

""Some 20 per cent of the world’s 7,616 breeds of domestic livestock are at risk, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. And change is accelerating. Holstein-Friesian dairy cows are now raised in 128 countries in all regions of the world, and an astonishing 90 per cent of all cattle in the North are of just six tightly defined breeds.""

""From Africa to Asia, farmers of the South, like the farmers of Europe, Oceania and the Americas before them, are increasingly choosing the breeds that will produce more milk, meat and eggs to feed their hungry families and raise their incomes.""

""the breeds that are being left behind not only have intrinsic value, but also may possess genetic attributes critical to addressing future food security challenges, in developed or developing countries, as the climate, pests and diseases all change.""

Native livestock are those varieties that developed to survive the best and worst of times, in the poorer nations, our Western breeds just don't measure up, they were developed in totally different environments. Not that they always do terribly well here either, lol, but when something goes wrong, a drought, a food shortage, the native stock always prove more capable of surviving, as our Western varieties take over, we leave the poor nations with less avenues, agriculturally speaking. Sadly we also leave ourselves with less avenues, even Britain is losing it's native livestock as we favour the modern high yield varieties over them.

Domestic beers are cheap and ubiquitous. Budweiser, miller high life for example are domestic beers. Billy takes a 30pack of them when he goes fishing at the weekend. He puts them in the back of his truck. Mona buys a pack of them when the Dallas cowboys are playing and invites her relatives over. Mona says the budweiser in Texas is much better than elsewhere.


If there was only one 'miro-brew' brand though, they would probably be shown to sell more. Americans love their micro brews and with good reason. They are delicious. Fat Tire, Sierra Nevada to name a couple are fantastic but localized. What most Americans don't realize though is that their 'domestic beers' in Europe sell for the same price as high end big name brands like carlsberg, Heineken, and Guinness.

If there was such a dick-tator like Adolf in the present, and I was the only one who could kill him, I'd cheerfully put a bullet through his head, then empty the rest of the clip there too to ensure that he doesn't survive it and continue to rule with some brain damage to spice it up. Afterwards, I'd brag about it to everyone.

The problem is that by killing Hitler, you don't only kill him - you kill pretty much everyone born after '39. There's probably no such thing as ""destiny"". Removing Hitler from the equation changes the life of every single human being *ever*. Conception is one of the most random acts of nature. If, as the result of your actions two people get busy a second or two later, the probability of the same sperm fertilizing the egg is extremely low, almost negligible. Thus no one who was conceived after your shot would get conceived, including probably you, your friends, your parents, your brothers and sisters, your girlfriend, your friends, etc..., so even if you could return to the present, you would be a stranger in a strange land.

Also, the political situation back then pretty much guaranteed there was going to be a war soon. The peace that closed WW1 created a lot of tension around Europe and left the economy of the Central Powers in ruins. The dissatisfaction and the despair of the people in those countries led to the rise of the far-right powers, thus to WW2. Killing Hitler wouldn't have solved anything. If you killed him before the Beer Hall Putsch, then *maybe* you could have prevented the Holocaust, as he wrote the Mein Kampf in prison, but millions of soldiers and civilians were still going to die. If you killed him after he wrote the book then the same shit would have happened, only with a less crazy leader (Göbbels, most probably) who wouldn't attack the SU. The German army was powerful enough to conquer the rest of Europe had they not fought on two fronts.

,8,"Greece ""interfered"" with Cyprus because it was, at that time, run by a thoroughly inept and corrupt military Junta which -- ironically -- was hoisted and supported by, until they eventually fell out of favor with, the United States government (primarily the CIA).

-- The following quoted from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_invasion_of_Cyprus)

Turks seeking to justify the Turkish invasion, often refer to a few isolated judgements which may, taken out of context, appear to go against the grain. They often refer to a purported judgement of the Standing Committee of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe (resolution 532 / 1974), dated 29 July 1974, which stated the following :
""Turkey exercised its right of intervention in accordance with Article IV of the Guarantee Treaty.""
The key feature of the statement purportedly made at the CoE is the date at which is was made. At the time of the statement, it was not yet absolutely apparent that Turkey, rather than using its right of intervention as a Guarantor power, was acting contrary to it, under its guise.
Critically, following the date, the Greek junta had collapsed and the democratic government of the Republic of Cyprus was restored under Glafkos Clerides leaving further “intervention” unwarranted. Nevertheless, there followed a second wave of Turkish invasion which was universally condemned and revealed the underlying motivations behind the first wave.
Whereas the first wave of military action was and still is said (by many Turks) to have been carried out in accordance with the right of intervention, the second wave of military action revealed that Turkey’s right of intervention was used as little more than a guise for an invasion. The second phase of the Turkish invasion was characterised by a disproportionate use of violence and disproportionare occupation of territory (in relation to the ethnic populations) Ultimately, the right of intervention to protect the sovereignty, integrity and independence of the Republic of Cyprus was abused as those goals were undermined by Turkey’s creation of an internationally unrecognised pseudo-state, the TRNC, and the stationing of 40000 Turkish troops on sovereign territory of the Republic of Cyprus, in violation of all resolutions of the United Nations.

,7,"General background info:

There will be early elections in the Netherlands next week, on 9 June, after the collapse of the Christian-Democratic/Labour/Christian Union government a couple of months ago.

Judging on the latest polls, the left-wing parties will be losing badly. The Labour Party, which already did very badly four years ago, is set to lose a little further ground still. The Socialist Party, which scored a sensational result in 2006, is now set to fall back to modest levels (though it's currently enjoying something of a last-minute rally).

On the right, the Christian-Democrats of Prime Minister Balkenende are set to lose many votes as well, but the gains that other right-wing parties will likely make will make more than up for that.

The right-wing liberals are the flavour-du-jour, having gone up from less than 15% in the polls two to three months ago to close to 25% now. (For the Americans among you, the right-wing liberal parties you can find in many European countries are all stridently pro-free market, but tend to be secular and culturally liberal - though some of them, including the Dutch VVD, combine open-minded views on things such as gay marriage and abortion with a distinct nationalism and anti-immigrant rhetorics.)

I would first and foremost recommend that you become a member of [couchsurfing](www.couchsurfing.org]. Not only can you meet some really great people, get local advice on places to go and things to see, but it's a free place to stay. 

Second, check out the local cheap airlines, ryanair, easyjet...you can find flights as low as 0.01 pounds (before taxes). The train isn't a bad way to experience Europe, it's just expensive. The travel between locations will probably be the most expensive part of your trip. So, that's a decision you'll have to make. 

Also, make sure to look for free bikes. Many big cities have 'green bike' programs. Public bikes that you pick up, ride and drop off.

2) The cancellation of an unconstitutional government endorsement of the Christian religion would only feel like ""a blow to the solar plexus for battle weary Christians"" if they believe that its their duty to force non-Christians to kowtow to Christianity by means of governmental power.

3) Liberals, nor yet atheists which are two different categories, are not frightened by prayer.  We do, however, get darn nervous by **government sponsored** prayer as that seems like a step down the slippery slope to theocracy.

4) No one claims that Christians, nor any other religious people, should be prohibited from praying.  We merely don't want to allow government money, property, etc to be involved in leading prayer.

&gt;More importantly, acts of hatred, name-calling, or intolerant public jeering have never occurred at one of these prayer events.

Bull paddies.  The US Senate, much to our national shame and quite unconstitutionally, begins each session with a prayer.  That prayer has been pretty much exclusively Christian for our entire history.  This prayer has never, not one single time, been disrupted by atheists or non-Christians.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZ9To30Hz7A

That's a video of the first ever attempt to open the Senate with a prayer lead by a Hindu priest.

Let's quote the lying article again:

&gt;More importantly, acts of hatred, name-calling, or intolerant public jeering have never occurred at one of these prayer events.

Yeah.

EDIT: I should add that any thinking Christian should also be made very nervous at the prospect of government endorsed religion.  Throughout European history that was the primary cause of Christian on Christian persecution.  Governments can't, not really, just endorse ""Christianity"", mainly because there is no such thing.  There's Catholocism, and Seventh Day Adventism, and Baptism, and Church of Christism, and Episcopalism, etc.

Once a government becomes sectarian, which is the antonym of secular, the question becomes ""which sect?""  If your sect isn't the lucky sect, then you'll face worse problems than us atheists.  And, of course, even if your sect is the ""lucky"" sect, you've still got problems.  Now its a para-governmental agency, and that means its under governmental control (kinda).  Your priest/minister/whatever goes against sectarian doctrine today and the worst result is a schism.  In a sectarian government going against the **government decreed** sectarian rules means heresy charges and arrest.

[Jamal Elshayyal](http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/06/2010639114160373.html):

There is no such force internationally (although everyone calls america the worlds police force). Now israel is there and waiting for this police force, but it doesn't exist. It doesn't exist because the views and political needs of the world are too many and varied and self serving. You're not about to see a UN force march in israel is just isn't about to happen.

Now things like the hauge and human rights courts etc are only any use if you can actually lay your hands on the people committing these internationally defined crimes. How many world leaders in power right now and in power previously could be brought to hand but aren't, because there is no power to go in and arrest these people.

,1,"Hi Tybris, appreciate your direct and honest comment. Standard of living. All indexes that tried to move away from GDP to reflect quality of life ended up mirroring GDP. Could you state what std of living means for you. I guess there is something about space/wilderness in the Pac NW that you don't have in the Netherlands, but do in many other European countries. Electronics goods are far cheaper in America than in other western economies. Single market, economies of scale. Unfortunately the EEC hasn't won on that yet!! The cost of the EEC bureaucracy must be phenomenal and remove any gains from a better integrated Europe. I agree on the material / consumer aspects of US society. Are they significant (paying more/less range irritates me but doesn't really mitigate std of life outcomes) - I am surprised you find them so.
However, do you fear the police in the US? Or at least have the same view of them as in NL/D/B/Fr? Walk the streets as easily as you do in NL? Do you think there is an educational differentiation between US and NL? For eg. NL has the largest number of private company start ups in Europe. Considered an entrepreneurial society. I understand societal education in NL and much of western Europe is higher than the US.
As you are in business you state US business is better, why? They get (being English speakers) cream from Europe, GB, Australia, South Africa etc and higher quality/sophistication ensues? New blood. It is hard for foreigners to choose NL as a destination, language, climate and limited geography make it difficult for new people. (Dutch academic institutions though do very well with foreign academics visiting/sabbaticals/contributing. Having lived in Europe for 20 yrs, other western economies for about the same and a few years in and out of the US (some on business) the quality of many individual Americans is impressive. I don't think they are in numbers sufficient to overcome the negatively recrudescent spiral that corporatism, American urbanism,  poor social educational levels and the limited outlook its populace creates. Also American makes much capital /wealth from intimidating smaller countries eg South American, African states and other western economies - threatened Australia with sanctions if it did not permit the USA to cripple its film industry and maintain cuckoo status. This will occur less as China takes over that role. Britain's net invisibles were huge because of its foreign controls.
American corporatism since the Bush/Cheyney regime has fundamentally destroyed creative business development and follows a robber / standover mentality because the cake is no longer sufficiently growing.

1 - As Europe was a tinderbox at that time, it is quite possible the war would have started anyway, caused by someone else. But his was the shot that started WW1, WW2, the Cold War and the Middle East.

3 - The Ottoman Empire would have liked to have allied with England and France to help defend themselves from Russia [4]. However Russia was already aligned with England and France. This meant that they had to join an alliance with the only other military power remaining: Germany and the AustroHungarian empire. Being on the losing side of the war, the Ottoman Empire was broken up by the [Treaty of Sèvres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_S%C3%A8vres).

But as for finding records of that time, I think it would be rather difficult. From what I gather through articles like [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_of_Germans_after_World_War_II), the expulsion of ethnic Germans from all over Europe was rushed, chaotic, and rife with acts of victimization by those doing the expelling; so due to all of those, it would seem like those doing the expelling wouldn't be as good with keeping records as they should, or if they did keep records but also committed crimes to the ethnic Germans they were expelling, it makes sense that they would destroy any related records that would make those crimes verifiable. 

And from what I gather, the expulsions varied very widely in how they were done and how fair/brutal they were. Like Hungary, they only did expulsions when forced to by the international agreement, and even then, they didn't separate mixed German/Hungarian families. Though in the Netherlands they did separate families, removing the ethnic German members. Though the worst of it was in the region that was the former far eastern part of Germany. (and other ethnic minorities were expelled during what was done to Germans in the couple years following the war, Ukrainians, Italians, and I think a few others; something ironic about the post-war push for ethnically pure nation-states, wonder where they got *that* idea from...)

I do hope that as the World War 2 generation dies off, and this becomes the stuff of historians, that more will come to light and we'll learn more about what exactly happened.

Yes, of course I do.

What you've now gone from saying is that Israel is not being unreasonable to Israel just takes what it wants but that's okay because nobody can hold them accountable.  Not the same thing.  You've completely changed tac.

You've gone from arguing the blockade as legal - quite vehemently too, to completely surrendering that defense and saying it's only an intellectual exercise because they can do what ever they want.

Well, no.  They can't and Israel is realising that.  It's starting to feeling the reprisals.

People are holding them accountable.  They're looking at the blockade and saying 'No'.  From this one flotilla Israel has already lost an ally, a planned natural gas pipeline and a fresh water program.  Israel is not resource rich.  Their economy is based on agriculture, technology, finance and tourism.  Tourism is huge and a major component of their economy.  In the first half of 2009 following Israel's catastrophic PR tourism was down over 20% on the previous year.  No matter what figures the Israeli government tells the Tourist Board to put out - this has burnt them.

Now you have to look at what Israel needs.  They already know that gone are the days of the 1990s where the Israel lobby in the US was taboo.  Everyone knows about it.  During Op CastLead there were major protests in most major cities across Europe.  That means that governments can't be lent on as heavy by these lobbyists.  They now have the popular people lobby.  It's getting easier to speak out and to act.  Israel also needs US support and their veto.  That relationship is changing.  [People are talking about it.](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/may/26/postamericanisrael) They need migration because they're facing a demographic time bomb.  The real threat is when moderate dual Israel citizens start to leave because of Israel's lurch to the authoritarian right.  All these things are being effected and brought about.  Israel's never had great PR but the last few years a corner somewhere has been turned.  They're pepper-pottering their public persona from disaster to crisis and back again.

**Go Off Path** - Dont be afraid to go off the beaten path in Barcelona. Its full of old paved streets and alleyways. Its probably the safest city I've been in. I know its got a reputation for pickpocketing but its cleaner and safer than most British cities (I've been to most). An alleyway in Barcelona will normally have a nice tapas bar, ice cream shop and even an antique chair shop! I never saw any overt crime while there.

**La Ramblas** - this is basically a large pedestrianised street. Its got a lot of history and a lot of culture surrounding it. I believe the cathedral is just off it - I walked past it several times without realising though!

**Language** - you're better off learning Spanish (a good site: http://www.livemocha.com). Everyone knows Spanish but if you learn Catalan and happen to speak to a non-Catalonian you're stumped. Most people are very happy to hear you trying the language and try REALLY hard to help you out. You do get some less than patient people but it is a large city so its to be expected.

**Sagrada Familia** - this isn't the cathedral I mentioned earlier. This is further north in Barcelona. Its an unfinished church with an absolutely stunning gothic design. I took 2 days to get round to seeing this because I didn't think a church could be *that* interesting. But seriously - its stunning. See it!

**Street Sellers** - its got a rich trading history and you can see that in the number of street vendors. At night you get groups selling cans of beer on the street. Posters, souvenirs, etc. They don't pester you but I wouldn't bother buying anything from them as you can normally get cheaper/better from a shop round the corner.

**San Miguel Beer** - I dunno where you're from but in the UK there's a popular Spanish beer called San Miguel. Well this stuff is actually brewed in Barcelona. They're very proud of it and they have a lot of different varieties. Dark, light, etc. I'd recommend trying a few out - when in Rome as they say!!

**Sex** - I may as well mention this as every major city has it. I have no direct experience with the prostitues (I never partook!). I did get propositioned a lot though especially round La Rambla. La Rambla is the place in Barca for all the good and bad side of nature. 

What I can say is the vast majority of prostitutes who go after foreigners in Barca are North African immigrants, some of which look underage.

,6,"I'm starting to repeat myself in these comments, but here goes:

Turkey has gained quite a bit from the Mavi Marmara incident, partly because Israel has responded with astonishing ineptitude. Possible advantages for Turkey, not in any kind of order:

* Egypt has opened the border with Gaza, and Turkey has got some credit for this both domestically and internationally.

* Turkey was beginning to view its close relationship with Israel as something of an embarrassment. Now Turkey has an excuse to back off without losing any credibility. 

* Turkey has been getting a lot of flak for its treatment of the Kurds, its occupation of Cyprus, and its denial of the Armenian genocide. Now they can look like the good guys, at least in comparison to Israel. 

* Turkey can now play the NATO card the US and EU will have to give it some incentives in lieu of actual action. 

* This will help cement Turkey's relations with other Middle Eastern nations, furthering their ambition to be the bridge between Europe and the Middle East.  

Actually going to war would nullify many of these ambitions. It would be an astonishingly risky move because it's possible that a war with Israel could bring in other participants. A Turkish victory is far from a foregone conclusion. 

Even if Turkey won, it could take a great deal of damage both economically and politically: for example few tourists would visit Turkey during hostilities.

Turkey stands to gain much more from the situation as it is now, than from a war. Turkey could be tempted to play a dangerous game of brinkmanship and could inadvertently trigger a war. For example if Turkey accompanies an aid ship with naval vessels, there's a ""dispute"" about the position of one of the ships, and an IDF unit attacks it. 

Perhaps this is why the Mavi Marmara was quietly reflagged: it gives the  Turks a get-out clause if things start to get out of hand.

I appreciate and love soccer/football in all its forms. I watch mostly European soccer because first off I love Arsenal, their style of play, their style of management and the players themselves. For me, trying to watch MLS after watching European soccer (This includes, La Liga, Serie A, Ligue 1, Bundesliga, Russian Premier League, and occasionally the Eredivise) is like going from driving a Mercedes Benz/BMW to driving a beat up old Chevy Malibu. It just doesn't compare. This is not to say that I don't feel that the MLS is getting better, it certainly is as shown by the US Men's team being the strongest in years. But I just don't have any personal connection to the players or clubs from the MLS, and as such, I don't follow a large number of USMNT players. Donovan, Altidore, Howard, Dempsey, etc. are all excellent players, and I do enjoy watching them play, however as a team they feel somewhat disjointed to me.

Because of my exposure, I really really appreciate the clubs, players and national teams of Europe. I understand and enjoy watching them much more than my own nation's team. I want the Netherlands to win because I feel they deserve it. I love their players, namely (van Persie, Sneijder, Huntelaar, Nigel de Jong, and Bronckhorst), and playing style as well and I feel it represents an ideal in football of fluid, attacking, clean passing football. I believe they should win because they deserve it in my opinion. The US doesn't even care about soccer to be honest, most of the people I know who will be supporting the US in the world cup do so because they're supposed to, and they think it would be funny if the US beat any big European names.

You have to consider the fact that many of the Americans who grew up watching soccer in the US, didn't grow up watching MLS, unlike those of you from England or Spain let's say, who most likely grew up watching the EPL or La Liga. We don't have a history of it here, and for the most part the general public lacks an appreciation for good soccer.

I wish the USMNT the best in the World Cup, and I'll be watching many of their games, (definitely England v USA, in which I will be rooting for USA because Capello left out Walcott which angered me, but also probably USA v Slovenia), but realistically I don't expect them to win. And my support for a potential winner goes to the Netherlands, not on patriotic principle like many do, but on the principle that I believe the team that I feel deserves the trophy the most due to skill, style, and respect for the game, should lift the trophy.

**WHAT???**

Arabs and Palestinians absolutely have rights and responsibilities, just like everybody else.  It's boggling you invoke racism whilst the Israeli government neither meets its responsibilities or recognises the rights in others.

Truly staggering.

&gt;You can't consider that it is possible that the condition of the Palestinian people has something to do with the actions of the Palestinian people.

The international community is polarized in that the Palestinian people are being collectively punished.  I can understand Israel having issues with Hamas but even on that score they are the ones that asked for a ceasefire, they are the ones that policed it, they aren't the ones that broke it and alongside the Arab Peace Initiative they have said they will accept Israel if international law is seen to be adhered and 1967 borders adopted.  International law provides for a right of return, has found East Jerusalem to be illegally annexed and that the settlements are illegally built.

&gt;Instead since you see Jews as White and European (a relatively recent notion, in the 19th Century and earlier they were dark and Eastern) the Jews have to be responsible for everything.

Actually I'm incredibly proud of the Jewish communities outside Israel and collectively admire them immensely.  During Operation Cast Lead they joined in protests saying 'not in our name'.  The British Academia boycott was organized by British Jews in academia.  Voice for Peace was set up in New York.  [It's work is immeasurable.](http://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/)  If anything I'm even more impressed with the Jewish moderates in Israel living under this authoritarian yoke supposedly in their name: Rabbis for peace, [Gush Shalom](http://www.gush-shalom.org/) and of B'Tselem amongst many, many more (check out the Gush Shalom pic).

I wish I could say I can't believe you've just tried to place the ol'race anti-semitism card, only I can.  I was talking about Israel breaking international law and you transferred that into seeing ""Jews as white and European"" and ""the Jews... responsible for everything"".   You're unhinged.

I suppose you think these people, these Israeli Jewish people also protesting the blockade and collective punishment of Gaza; these people that are repeating the same line in Ashdod, Tel Aviv, Haifia and Jerusalem as I am here, that they are also anti-Jewish.

Yes, and thousands upon thousands of climate scientists, publishing data around the world, with a large variety of different sub-sciences, are all converging on the same basic picture. Appeal to authority is perfectly valid and rational when the authority is an expert in the field in question.

&gt;There is no functioning model for global warming that has yet made a statistically significant prediction.

Completely wrong. [Climate models predict the climate just fine.](http://www.skepticalscience.com/images/IPCC_model_vs_obs.gif) But climate is defined by the World Meteorological Organization as weather averaged over 30 years *or more*. What so-called climate ""skeptics"" do is zoom down to a decade or five years, where climate models are not detailed enough to predict yearly and decadal noise, and claim that this proves the models are wrong.

This is like having a set of loaded dice and claiming that since you can't predict each individual roll that therefore you can't predict that 7 will come up more than any other number.

I'm sorry, but this is not skepticism. This is anti-science.

And secondly, the conclusion of global warming does not come solely from models, but *from a wide variety of data around the world.* For instance:

* As measured by satellites, there is more heat coming than going, and the heat that is missing is of the same wavelength that CO2 absorbs ([Harries 2001](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v410/n6826/abs/410355a0.html), [Griggs 2004](http://spiedl.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=PSISDG005543000001000164000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes&amp;ref=no), [Chen 2007](http://www.eumetsat.eu/Home/Main/Publications/Conference_and_Workshop_Proceedings/groups/cps/documents/document/pdf_conf_p50_s9_01_harries_v.pdf))

* Heat of the wavelength that CO2 absorbs is increasing at the surface level ([Philipona 2004](http://landshape.org/enm/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/philipona2004-radiation.pdf), [Evans 2006](http://ams.confex.com/ams/Annual2006/techprogram/paper_100737.htm))

,1,"&gt; Hi Tybris, appreciate your direct and honest comment. Standard of living. All indexes that tried to move away from GDP to reflect quality of life ended up mirroring GDP. Could you state what std of living means for you. I guess there is something about space/wilderness in the Pac NW that you don't have in the Netherlands, but do in many other European countries. Electronics goods are far cheaper in America than in other western economies. Single market, economies of scale. Unfortunately the EEC hasn't won on that yet!! The cost of the EEC bureaucracy must be phenomenal and remove any gains from a better integrated Europe. I agree on the material / consumer aspects of US society. Are they significant (paying more/less range irritates me but doesn't really mitigate std of life outcomes) - I am surprised you find them so. 

As a baseline there I find GDP (PPP) per capita quite reasonable  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita . I think the idea that that Americans are 16% richer than the Dutch across the board is not unrealistic. Of course, there are other elements to it, especially in the comparison to to the small top 10 countries. The quality/cost and availability of goods and services, and the rate at which business develops and innovative products become available is hard to measure, but my personal experience is that these are truly much greater in the United States. This includes the areas that have a big impact on the quality of life such as health care, finance, education and legal protection. 

Health care is a controversial issue. For a person with regular employment, the cost of American health care are lower than the European income tax used to pay for it or keep prices down. However, since the unemployed and underpaid need health care too, this is not necessarily a good policy. That's why the U.S. is copying the European model in this particular case.

&gt; However, do you fear the police in the US? Or at least have the same view of them as in NL/D/B/Fr? 

I generally have too little contact with police to make any judgement on this issue. I do perceive the Dutch legal system as more humane, for example with regard to drug use, but I don't have personal experience with either and see the drawbacks as avoidable.

&gt; Walk the streets as easily as you do in NL? 

I never felt unsafe in the United States. People seem generally more relaxed and passive. American football (tail gates) vs. European football (riots) are a prime example of this. The only thing that bothers me is the high rate of homelessness, but I have rarely seen an American homeless person become aggressive. Quite the opposite to my experience in Europe where homelessness might be low, but alcohol abuse and the resulting aggression is high.

&gt; Do you think there is an educational differentiation between US and NL? 

Yes. The top tier is not facilitated in the Netherlands, while the bottom tiers gets more support. 

&gt; For eg. NL has the largest number of private company start ups in Europe. Considered an entrepreneurial society. 

You probably know of successful Dutch companies like Shell, ING, and Philips, but each of these is over 100 years old. Overall the society is not shaped to support a large density of businesses. A vast body of local and national regulations keeps them from growing quickly enough to be competitive. More than in the U.S., start-ups remain small or file for bankruptcy. Venture capital is virtually non-existent. Banks provide investment, but require more collateral, such as existing businesses or real estate, which is not available to young entrepreneurs.

(note: I'm not comparing the Netherlands to a third world country in which doing business is virtually impossible, just claiming that there's a noticeable difference)

&gt; As you are in business you state US business is better, why? 

Less regulation. More financing opportunities. Lower production costs. Bigger market. Larger workforce, especially in the top tier of education. This all leads to faster innovation and higher impact of the business.

&gt; They get (being English speakers) cream from Europe, GB, Australia, South Africa etc and higher quality/sophistication ensues? New blood. It is hard for foreigners to choose NL as a destination, language, climate and limited geography make it difficult for new people. 

I don't think the language barrier between the Netherlands and the United States is that great. You can move both ways without much trouble thanks to the high percentage of Dutch people that have reasonable acquaintance with the English language (due to the U.S. exporting it). It's really more about economic attractiveness. 

&gt; (Dutch academic institutions though do very well with foreign academics visiting/sabbaticals/contributing. 

As I said, the Netherlands does not invest heavily in top tier education (PhDs), but do pay for high-quality research (postdocs, profs). This attracts researchers, but offers few economic benefits, since the academic research is published internationally and the researchers tend to move on. A more market-driven model promotes top tier education, since that brings money to the research institutes through fees and donations. 

&gt; Having lived in Europe for 20 yrs, other western economies for about the same and a few years in and out of the US (some on business) the quality of many individual Americans is impressive. I don't think they are in numbers sufficient to overcome the negatively recrudescent spiral that corporatism, American urbanism, poor social educational levels and the limited outlook its populace creates. 

Social inequality is certainly the main drawbacks of the American model and this affects a significant percentage of the population, but certainly not a majority. The question is really how much social inequality you are willing to accept. Especially when I first moved to the U.S. I noticed that Americans have different boundaries than Europeans. I could not really blame them, since social inequality is also necessary for society to change and adapt. If all people need to have access to the same services at all time, it becomes impossible to deploy a new service. This is why pure socialism failed and why Europeans have trouble innovating from their garage. I've come to accept the American tolerance to social inequality by understanding its advantages and drawbacks. 

&gt; Also American makes much capital /wealth from intimidating smaller countries eg South American, African states and other western economies - threatened Australia with sanctions if it did not permit the USA to cripple its film industry and maintain cuckoo status. This will occur less as China takes over that role. Britain's net invisibles were huge because of its foreign controls. 

That only comes at the cost of humungous defense investments, which have often been falsely identified as good for the economy (it really depends on who your investors are). Much of the current economic crisis is a correction, which will give East a more equal, yet still significantly smaller, share of the pie. U.S. policy will have to adapt to the new reality. 

&gt; American corporatism since the Bush/Cheyney regime has fundamentally destroyed creative business development and follows a robber / standover mentality because the cake is no longer sufficiently growing. When there isn't economic growth one becomes tougher so as to take what you perceive you need (a la Mancur Olson.)

I would say one of the aspects of American economy is that some things have become too good. Walmart is irresistible, and so are SUVs, big houses and cheap loans. Wealthy lobbies have become too good at convincing politicians to defend their interests. Business banks have become too good at making money, leeching on the rest of the economy. Large corporations have become too good at reducing competition. This has certainly caused the people's economy to shift in the wrong direction. Still, I think it will take many years before the European model becomes more attractive to regular people than the American one. Every day an American starts a business, which will have massive impact on the quality of life. That just doesn't happen much in Europe. What is the European answer to Internet, Biotech, Solar energy, Electric vehicles? Hardly any. Doesn't happen or not nearly at the same scale.

but you know what?  That was never, literally, never, the case for Jews living in Arabian peninsula until the creation of Israel.

Our dominance after World War II was not sought...we are the rarest of geopolitical phenomena: the accidental hegemon and, given our history of isolationism and lack of instinctive imperial ambition, the reluctant hegemony -- and now, after a near-decade of strenuous post-9/11 exertion, more reluctant than ever."" 

And the best part (speaking of Obama's ""indictments"" of America's past mistakes, like Vietnam, etc.): 
""Quite an indictment, the fundamental consequence of which is to effectively undermine any moral claim that America might have to world leadership, as well as the moral confidence that any nation needs to have in order to justify to itself and to others its position of leadership.""

Indeed they do: until recently Sweden's been pretty monocultural and a consequence has been a degree of xenophobia and racism, especially to groups thought *particularly* different from traditional Swedes.

Along come several waves of immigration by Muslims. Swedes, on the whole being reasonable people, try to accommodate new immigrants by adapting to the new and at first unfamiliar *multiculturalism*.

Many of the newly arrived and then second and then 3rd generation of Muslims harbour a traditional Muslim antipathy to Jews, and foment  new waves of antisemitism. 

So non-Muslim Swedes may feel ambivalent about their Muslim countrymen, expressing that at the periphery in out-and-out racism directed at Muslims; and some Muslims make common cause with traditional antisemitism to make life difficult for Swedish Jews.

There are estimated to be some 60,000 Muslims in Malmo and just 700 Jews - a number that's halved in 20 years.

,12,"Whenever a mass shooting occurs and much of the pro-gun community begins processing this as ""an example of gun control not working,"" my first thought is toward the human condition: namely, that human beings are capable of evil and I never want to be disarmed in such a world.

At this point, I wonder whether there is anyone who hasn't taken a stand on whether gun control can really prevent violence.  And of those who have, on either side, I seriously wonder whether a single person is capable of changing their mind on the issue.

At some point, I lost interest in this question.  Gun rights respected, gun rights infringed, I will always have a gun.

And the ""debate"" about this is light entertainment for me, at best.

The political fight is important, of course.  But I don't think the ""debate"" connects with the political fight as much as I think it once did.   Even as a minority, a well organized, strategic political movement is probably going to be more effective (at least in the United States) than a disorganized, weak political movement which represents a hypothetical anti-gun majority.  What must steam the Brady people is how ineffective they are at getting people to the voting booth the way the NRA does.

It is why with all their flaws and even occasional treachery, I think the single best thing a person can do - if we look at the net effects on their rights when all is said and done - is to join the National Rifle Association.

I have heard and understand a lot of the objections to the NRA, and that need not be the only thing a person gets involved with, but, on balance, a principled pro-gun lobbying organization which has minor pull is less effective in protecting my rights than a compromised one with a lot of pull.  

And the NRA has a lot - orders of magnitude, perhaps (on the federal level) over the next most famous group, GOA.  Ideally, one would be members of both.  (I am a member of the AzCDL, a bafflingly effective state lobbying group here in Arizona which has pulled countless rabbits of out of their hat, legislatively.  I salute them most of all.)

But it is as if, in many countries, the more you roll over and just let bad people go rampaging through the streets, and the less willing you are to defend yourself, and the more you back down from every fight, the more enlightened and modern you are.

Sacrificing your right to defend yourself and prostrating yourself before a government which is at best incompetent in protecting people and at worst not on your side is not enlightened.  I've tried to admire this brand of pacifism, and I can't.  No matter how I try to read it as philosophically principled, all I see is weakness masquerading as sophistication.  

It is historically stupid, and a demonstration of nothing more than being milquetoast - one forgivable as a personal choice when it is you, personally, but one less forgivable when it is a surrender which also enables the snuffing out of innocent lives around you - maybe your own family.  

It is as if people find a comfort in submission to violence and evil.  By insisting they can do nothing (note the insistence so many have on attacking the efficacy of firearms for self defense - it is not even that they believe it but that they desperately need this to be true to have a perfect, non-contradictory list of reasons for pushing submission), there is peace in surrender, as the terminally ill patient eventually accepts and surrenders to death.  It is as if Europeans want nothing more than to go gently into that good night.  

How am I supposed to look at a man who thinks it would be better to submit to an armed criminal in his own home, endangering the lives of his wife and children, and who berates me for being some kind of impetuous cowboy who has seen too many movies for insisting on my right and duty to take a stand?  I can only regard such a man with contempt, the way I regarded people - even myself at times - who didn't stand up for themselves in schoolyards.  I am not a tough guy at all.  But I know enough to despise my own weakness and, at times, cowardice.  I know enough to understand that good men must make a stand.  Men like Orwell and Kipling and Churchill understood this too.  I don't know what softened Britain up so much, but it is disappointing because I expect so much more.  Enlightenment and civilization are the products of good men speaking softly and carrying, when necessary, a big stick.  They are not the product of rolling over and submitting to those who seek to destroy civilization, order, and decency by preying on the innocent.

The faith people have in their governments, and for fate to work in their favor is less childlike than it is childish.   I'm talking about the ""grinch"" moment, like in the cartoon where mean Mr. Grinch looks into the eyes of a peaceful person and his heart swells, and he decides to do no more wrong.  I honestly get the sense that people encountering a carjacker or home invader believe that this is all that is required to get the perpetrator to experience this moment of peace, love, and understanding.  Part of me wishes this was true, but I would think that adults by this point would really know it isn't.

In the end, what irritates me about the debate is the sanctimoniousness of those who state proudly that they'd rather not resist in the face of an attack, and that somehow this is an attitude I should respect, like they're Christians walking into the mouths of lions or something.

,1,"That won't be allowed. Putting on my tin foil hat for a second, here's why:

Everything that runs in this world runs because of banks. The Warburg, Rockefeller, Kissinger families, as well as a few other lesser known ones started this system. Quoting Wikipedia: 

""At the end of November 1910, Senator Nelson W. Aldrich and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Department A.P. Andrews, and 5 more of the country's leading financiers, who together represented about one-fourth of the world's wealth[citation needed], arrived at the Jekyll Island Club to discuss monetary policy and the banking system, an event which some say was the impetus for the creation of the Federal Reserve.""

This happened almost 100 years ago, November of this year. With the creation of the American Federal Reserve system, it put the entire country into the debt of the banks, and that debt must be repaid somehow. This system systematically stretched out its arms and became the IMF around 30 years later. 

Basically, what they have set up 100 years ago they won't let be undone. Any opposition to them will be halted. When JFK was assassinated, he proposed to bring back the Gold Standard, meaning using *real*, Gold money that is not subject to inflation, and because of that the banks would hold no power over the US. So, he was assassinated.

Slowly the world has started to form into a collective government in the effort of peace and prosperity. The [League of Nations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations) was formed as a test run for a bigger scale operation. It eventually failed and became the UN Council. Later, the [EU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union#History) was created. The EU's monetary system is run by the IMF. Anyways, as you can see the world is slowly starting to form a collective, one government. The African Union is stretching its legs, but it is unimportant in the scale of things. There are other smaller Unions as well, but slowly they are becoming one unified group.

So, with this brief history lesson, I can tell you one thing with absolute certainty: No one is allowed to oppose this, the banks, or the process of unification. If you oppose it, you are a freedom hating terrorist, and you will be stopped. The easiest way is to dissuade people is to call them crazy conspiracy theorists, which usually stops most people. 

Why do you think that the G summits are held behind closed doors? Why is the Federal Reserve never audited? Simple questions, but with really complex answers.

So, in order to oppose this group of people who we don't even know, what they look like, or even their names, you would have to stop them at a base level and deconstruct them block by block, starting with the banks. Take down the financial sector on Wall Street, destroy the banking system, and you can start to destroy them. Then, destroy their oil supply. Without oil the world grinds to a halt, and their power grasp clenches to a small area for a long time. 

Maybe then you can oppose them.

Edit: Thought I would add some more. Below is the new stuff.

I'm going to start this off with a question, answer it before reading further please. Why is Washington driving itself into debt it can never repay?

Here's my answer. It has to. In order to keep up its military industrial complex growing, and to keep control on its people, it must drive itself further into debt. The Patriot Act is an example of control the government is trying to achieve. Once the US fully collapses, a new system will have to be set up to regain control of the idiot masses. That is what the Government is trying to achieve: The 1930's all over again. 2008 was just the tip of the iceberg, a preview of what is to come. Why would a government be so backwards towards its people? Because it isn't the US President who is calling the shots. If that isn't apparent to people nowadays, I can assume they live under a rock and never vote. 

buildingrage posted this on this page: ""This fucking government is driving me crazy. They don't understand shit about finance. I try to tell them they can't spend their way out of debt. But do these brain dead fuckers in Washington give a shit? Fuck no."". They *fully* understand what they are doing. The individual cogs in the machine don't know their purpose, but the machine is being beautifully orchestrated in a different, overarching direction. There will be no revolution against this system, that is what Martial Law is for; a complete grasp of control instantly by the military at the direction of the President.

Edit 2: Doesn't this all sound like [Metal Gear](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid)? Of course it does. Now, I hope this doesn't invalidate my previous writing because it is a video game. I play games, I make games, and I am pretty sure Kojima knows exactly what he is talking about. Let us relate a few facts between reality and fiction. The Patriots in the game are the ones calling the shots, much like the people behind closed doors are pulling the strings. The Patriots *s*elect the President of the United States, much like the president is s*elected* every 4 years. The Patriots one and only goal is to have a unified world government, much like the current shadow figures have that in mind. The Patriots also produce a system of ID tracking every single person through nanomachines; this is almost identical to what is being proposed through tracking, a chip in the hand to start, or a pill that floats in the blood stream. Yeah, some heavy conspiracy stuff right there, I know that.

In the history of the game, the Patriots were initially set up as [The Philosophers](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/The_Philosophers), which had access to most of the worlds money in the form of [The Philosophers Legacy](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/The_Philosophers); identical to what happened at Jekyll Island 100 years ago in reality. They soon branched out and had control over the many military's of the world, the production of medicine (Like the Rockefeller family has now over our own Pharmaceutical production), and created wars to fuel their power and to drive countries into the dirt. Does this sound familiar?

Now, this is a strange coincidence, and a really, really funny one at that, but the Gulf of Mexico's oil spill resembles the [Big Shell Incident](http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Big_Shell_Incident) in Metal Gear Solid 2. In the game the spill took place in 2007, and the cleanup was ongoing into 2009. It was known in the game as the worst environmental disaster in history. Close to home, hm? Now, this was used to create a new Metal Gear, ordered by the Patriots, in reality that won't be happening. Still, pretty fucking funny how good of a guess Kojima made in 2001.

In the same way technology is playing out, globalization will be the same.  We have only just hit the surface of what globalization can do for our economies.  Boosted by developments in technology, who knows what we'll be able to do just from sitting at a desk in our homes.

However, you are right: power is the name of the game, but money plays a large role in what power is and the shape it takes.  Just imagine what the US would be like if we didn't have lobbyists influencing policy.  These same forces have the same influences in the US, Europe, the Middle East, etc.  It's no longer bound by nationality or borders.

So while the end game (power) might not have changed, the rules and forces available in the game have.  As you've said, the system is working as intended since 1929.  That's right, but the system wasn't design for today's marketplace: it's antiquated.   That's why it's broken, that's why large corporations are able to take advantage of the system.

The idea that the system doesn't change is one that I ***strongly*** agree with.  Every instance of ""the system"" is design to resist change and to perpetuate the system, much like any other organism.  However, look at how the great depression changed our country.  Such instances do have the power to promote change.  Imagine what happens when the EU dissolves and all of Europe is bankrupt, the US double dips, and China goes into deflation.  The system will change, it has to or it won't survive.  

&gt; World politics and economics isn't a dynamical system that evolves and reaches some steady point after a while that balances interests' of various groups.

You're right, in some sense.  Within a certain timeframe, it's impossible to identify such an equilibrium.  Just like anything, there's volatility.  But over the course of decades or centuries, I would argue there's a steady increase towards this ""equilibrium"".  Globalization is definitely a driver towards such an equilibrium.  

I'm not saying we're headed towards Utopia.  I am saying that in the interest of maximizing profits, world-wide cooperation is a must.  In fact, this is a logical conclusion to a central idea in economics: free-trade and specialization benefit all parties.

It would be very silly to expect every person to be an expert in energy consumption, the politics of the crude oil trade and the other related issues, but your ignorance is shameful unless you are say, under 15.

I think what is worse is that after you managed to muddle through and figure out something that countless people already figured out, you are arrogant enough to say, ""What button do I push to get out?"" Your submission reminds me of a Dilbert cartoon where an idiot says, ""All the starving people in Africa should move to Europe.  Problem solved.""
Having reread your submission several times, I'm beginning to wonder if this is actually a troll-post, because it is still hard to fathom that someone with the competency to join /r/energy could make such an awful post.

**And where do you think you're going /r/energy?** Shame on you for giving this as many up-votes as it currently has. This submission is not insightful. This submission does not open up new discussion.

,2,"It can be estimated (via http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/404/CH1.HTM)

&gt; How do economic historians measure the GDP of ancient Rome or of the Carolingian Empire? After all, millennia ago there was no Commerce Department and no Bureau of Economic Analysis. Not until the seventeenth century did early demographers like John Graunt and Caspar Naumann begin tabulating actuarial data, and not until two centuries later did economists begin to collect the first accurate aggregate financial data for individual countries.

&gt; If you want to measure economic progress over the centuries, you first must ask, How much money is necessary to sustain a subsistence level of existence? Maddison estimated that in an underdeveloped nation in 1990, about $400 per year was required. Next, economic historians use whatever data they can find to determine what percentage of a population existed at this level. A society in which nearly 100% of the population is engaged in farming and that does not export any substantial amount of its agricultural products lives, by definition, very close to the $400 per year subsistence level. It is highly arbitrary to assign the same $400 per capita GDP, as Maddison did, to Europe at the beginning of the first century A.D., to China in 1950, or to modern-day Burkina Faso, but doing so at least provides economic historians with a benchmark against which to measure economic growth.

&gt; Another way of viewing this is to look at the ""urbanization ratio""— the proportion of the population living in cities larger than, say, 10,000, and, by inference, a measure of the proportion engaged in farming. At the height of the Greek and Roman periods, only a tiny percentage of the populace lived in cities of more than 10,000. By 1500, the largest city in Europe was Naples, with 150,000 inhabitants. Only 865,000 Europeans, or about 1% of the continent’s population, lived in cities of more than 50,000. Another 6% lived in towns of more than 10,000. More than 90% of Europeans, then, were engaged in agriculture in the medieval period. In the great civilizations of Asia, which during the medieval era were far more advanced than those in Europe, the percentage of the population engaged in agriculture was even closer to 100%; the vast riches of the tiny ruling elites did little to raise the overall level of prosperity in these domains. So it seems likely that before 1500, the world’s overall per capita GDP was close to the $400 subsistence level defined by Maddison.",history,0,0,True,2,1426332431,False,[deleted],,c0rhkrh,False,0,t5_2qh53,1275776680,,t1_c0rhkrh,t1_c0rhk8j,t3_cbpwf

But do you think that if tomorrow all turkish troops abandoned Cyprus, the turkish cypriots(along with the hundreds of thousands of colonizers which Turkey brought into the island) would be in any way oppresed by the current greek cypriot government(or greek cypriot people)? 

Though there are still some serious issues to be resolved, regarding the thousands of greek cypriots who are ""missing"" and the currently occupied by turks/cypriot turks property of greek cypriots(and vice versa but the turkish side has a lot more squatters). Another issue is whether turkish cypriots should get extra political power, veta power, etc to protect their rights, since they will be a minority. Though that was how things were before(greek cypriots ruled, turkish cypriots had veto power), i think this is the cause of most of the problems back then.

Also, like others have pointed out she is a monument, but unlike other monarchies in Europe Brittish monachy was not bestowed by other governments. When Dutch, Belgian, Norwegian monarchies were run over by Germany Germans also smashed what those monarchs represented, it took Russia and USA to install those monarchs back. Their title is essentially a gift from USA. Brittish crown, undefeated, truly represents continuation of the country that once ruled half a world.

in your opinion, what would be the situation of a person with a bachelor's degree (but no work experience) like? how hard would it be to find a job, and what kind of salary is one expected to look for?

i couldn't teach english since it's not my native language, but i'm going to get a degree in business/industrial engineering, and i think that should be useful as well.

my plan is to get a degree and then look for a job in hong kong or in bangkok, but i always wonder how hard that would be. i already ended up asking [different](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/bfbx0/since_when_does_entrylevel_mean_35_years/c0mhph1) [redditors](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ca7cc/do_any_semiqualified_redditors_want_to_teach/c0r7g7q) the same questions.

i often find myself thinking ""they've got their good number of engineers, why should they hire me?"". but then i hope a european and professional looking one should be sought-after too.
