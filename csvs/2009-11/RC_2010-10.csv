After all, it's my home there, I'm as British as you get - I'm great at complaining, I will happily sit and watch a five day test match, I love crumpets. I had a good job, working with great people. I wasn't utterly unhappy with my life, I just felt that I'd be happier elsewhere.

Although most of my friends from my hometown are English, throughout my life (especially at university) I've found that I gravitate towards foreign people. I love learning about other cultures and languages, and travelling around Europe just amplified that passion. At university my girlfriend was an English born Chinese girl, a lot of my friends were exchange students (my best friends were Singaporean, Barbadian, Japanese, Indian and Saudi Arabian). I was quite active in the Anime society at uni, even though I only followed a couple of series - it was mostly to meet people and practice my Japanese while drunk (Japanese people make terrible drinkers but fabulous drunks, FYI).

At the place I worked until I went freelance, they hired a lot of foreign interns to keep costs low - I was one of only two English people there, surrounded by young foreign girls. Again, I loved it, as I got to learn about people from all over Europe and further afield, their views on English life, etc. Even though they were 5 years younger than me they seemed much more worldly and comfortable within themselves, and just being around them made me start to believe that perhaps life in England wasn't necessarily for me. They also highlighted a lot of things about England that I didn't like (chavs, binge drinking, ridiculous cost of living, etc.), which caused me to think more about whether it's the same everywhere (pro tip: it isn't).

I've only ever had one fully English girlfriend and looking back at it, she was so boring. That's not to say that all English women are boring, just my own experience of being with one. I have English female friends who are lovely, but I'd never date them or girls like them.

I guess I've always been one of these people who likes to be 'different' - when my friends started going out clubbing in our teens I was smoking weed with friends and jamming. When everyone went to uni to study either politics or economics or business studies, I chose to do classics. Not in a 'too cool for school' hipster way, I just had no interest in the things that seemed to float everybody else's boats. Maybe that's why I gravitated towards things that weren't usual at the time, and still do now.

sorry but that's not true.

&gt; The US led coalition likely could have won all the primary engagements with Apache's and A-10s, leaving the infantry to roll around and clean up afterward. I suspect the only reason there were even any armor battles in the gulf was because there was a lot of Pentagon tank brass that spent the 70s and 80s training for a Russian tank battle that never came and wanted to work all that out on the next thing, the largest Russian supplied tank army in the world.

The Nato kill rate against Serbian tanks in 1999 was shockingly bad.

For 99% of Spanish media (including in media, Twitter, Facebook, blogs, tv, newspapers, radio, from left, right and centre) the General strike was a big failure, wasn't needed, and the pickets were just terrorists on the loose. They say that no one (&lt;7%) went on strike, and those who did, did so because they were scared off working by the violent pickets. 

80% of the Spanish public swallowed these lies. And in Spain we have a tradition of distrusting the institutions from time immemorial. In America, in the 80s, the air controllers went on strike and Reagan fired the whole lot of them on the spot, and no one said a word. And they were heavily unionised. Reagan killed the unions, worker's rights, and worker's salaries started spiralling down, or stalled. They are trying to do the same over here in Europe using the crisis as an excuse.

Truth is, more people I know went to work because their bosses told them that if they didn't show up to work on the day of the strike, they shouldn't bother coming back the next day. Workers in a shop right below my place were saying thank god for the pickets because of this very thing. If you don't go to work you might lose your job, but if someone else prevents you from going, you get the same effect, but your boss can't blame you.

First off, it sucks. The whole derailment of plans is so very frustrating. I hope that I am out of debt now, wait...I am in year three, you are still in year two; something is amiss. 

Gah, does this ever confuse me. First, I would like to say that you may have gotten out of this easy. For one thing, you are not the bad guy. To me that was/is very important. Mostly because I do truly love and cherish my relationships with her family. And you dont have a bunch of drama being spread about you in the female friend world. Which is going to be helpful later on. 

I say, we say; fuck it. Sell everything, and backpack Europe like we wanted to do in our youth. The jobs, houses, kids, all of that will be here when we get back. Remember, its about the experiences through life that makes it worth it. 

The best thing we ever did was to quit being that lazy douche. So grateful we quit smoking. Running is the true savior. No we havent ran the marathon yet, but, the women that run...oh my. I am actually in great shape. I do believe that if I needed to run from the police, I have a fairly good chance at getting away. Keep in mind that the reason we hit the gym is not just for all the hotties we can get, but so that we may actually have the ability to live as long as we can with the people we truly fall in love with. We want to live long enough to play with our grandchildren, see as many innovations to our Earth as we can, and to look into the eyes of Her, whom we have struggled to find our entire lives, forever. 

Please know that this is only temporary. We have much more hurt and heartache to go through later on. This pain is only preparing us for what we have to go through later on. Remember, if we aren't getting stronger, we are getting weaker. 

Sure, we can find solace in spirits. I prefer Beam and Coke for the  immediate, but nothing beats sitting outside, a cooler of beer, your best mate and some tunes. Dont listen to sad shit. Not until later, much later in the evening. I prefer we listen to some metal. Maiden, Crue, Chevelle, as that can induce some 'shot' sessions. Something like that early in the evening. Perhaps slowly work our way into some Apparat, or Little Boots, or Florence and The Machine midway through. We surely will be ending the night with some Ryan Bingham and Jamey Johnson. 

Dont go though the house, finding things that bring the ""Oh Remember's"" while we are drinking. That leads to phone calls and letter writing, emails that dont need to be sent and facebook stalking that could fuck us up later on. Please, please remember that we got out of this only slightly fucked up. It could have been a whole lot worse. We are now a person that is different. We are not the same as when we got married. That part of our brain is fucked. Forget about it. It will go away on its own. We are only to do simple shit right now until it does. Its like being on ""light duty"". Gym Tanning Laundry is now a rehabilitating therapy. Gets us back into the swing of things.

Googling to find the background to the dispute I found this

&gt; In 1984 the British government was taken to the European Court and had to amend the Equal pay Act to provide equal pay for work of equal value.

If you fancy the higher pay of those doing different work you should apply for the next job opening that comes along and get the higher pay that comes from the different work. If you are not allowed to, because you are the wrong sex, the government should step in to prevent sexual segregation. And the government should be vigilant to make sure that things aren't being rigged behind the scenes, with women being allowed to apply, but never getting the job.

But I'm appalled at the notion of having a tribunal decide that different kinds of work are of ""equal value"". In any sane world there are both men and women doing both kinds of work. Every-one has their individual preference for one kind of work over another and what wage premium would persuade them to switch.

I've seen documentaries and read articles that reverse these events.

The Ottoman Empire during the 1900s was trying to hold on for dear life and using Europe and the events of the Balkans as inspiration decided to attempt to unify the remaining Ottoman subjects under the label ""Turk.""


Keep in mind that prior to these events ""Turk"" meant nothing special in the Ottoman Empire, and racial Turks were given no special treatment over the other subjects (the divisions were religious rather than racial).",2,t3_dlf3a,True,t1_c113kvj,0,False,2,1426495754,,,c113kvj,0,0

Seasonal affective disorder is in Nordic genes, and the Vikings spread it
all over Europe and the British Isles.

Scientists have connected SADS to the violent berserker moods that Viking warriors exhibited and say that it has something to do with red melanin.

If you're fair-skinned and light haired, with blue eyes, you're more prone to SADS than people with dark hair and brown eyes.

Light therapy definitely helps to overcome how SADS messes with the body's circadian clock.

And, as I mentioned above, staring at saturated colors, like the brilliant yellow of a field of rapeseed is very therapeutic.

The Buddhist Vishuddamagga Sutra explains various ways for seekers to find enlightenment and it mentions meditations on remembering the Buddha, or meditating upon how disgusting the human body is in order to releases attachment to it in preparation for liberation from cyclical rebirth.

However, the Vishuddamagga Sutra also offers gazing upon brightly colored disks while practicing breath control.

These disks are called ""kasinas"" and are still used by monks in Thailand and Myanmar.

But I don't need any colored disk. I went to Windows Paint and made a yellow bitmap for my desktop.

I sit in the dark and stare at it and practice breath control.

If you think the Confederacy represented racism and prejudice, you are a fucking idiot.  Pick up any book of historic significance and you will quickly learn the difference between [propaganda](http://www.civilwarhome.com/propaganda.htm) and facts.

If you argue for strict construction of the Constitution, you are arguing the Confederate position; when you oppose pork-barrel spending,
you are arguing the Confederate position; when you oppose protective
tariffs, you are arguing the Confederate position; when you argue for the Bill of Rights, you are arguing the Confederate position; and when you argue that the Constitution limits the power and jurisdiction of the federal government, you are arguing the Confederate position.

One of things that gets lost when you adopt the politically
correct oversimplification that the War Between the States was a Civil War all about slavery is a whole treasure trove of American political history.

In fact, It was not a civil war.  A civil war is when two or more
factions contend for control of one government.  At no time did the South intend to or attempt to overthrow the government of the United States.  The Southern states simply withdrew from what they correctly viewed as a voluntary union. They formed their own union and adopted their own constitution.

Abraham Lincoln's invasion of the South was entirely without any constitutional authority.  And it's as plain as an elephant at a tea party that Lincoln did not seek to preserve the union in order to end slavery.  All you have to do is read his first inaugural address.  What Lincoln didn't want to lose was the tax revenue generated by the South.

As Northern states gained a majority in both houses, they
began to use the South as a cash cow.  Here's how it worked.  Most
Southerners who exported cotton bartered the cotton in Europe for goods.  When the protective tariffs were imposed, that meant Southerners had to pay them.  To make matters worse, the North would then use the revenue for pork-barrel projects in their states.  The South was faced with either paying high tariffs and receiving no benefits from the revenue or buying artificially high-priced Northern goods.

The South opposed pork-barrel spending.  Its correct view
was that because the federal government was merely the agent of all the states, whatever money it spent should be of equal benefit.  The South's position on public lands was that they belonged to all the people, and the federal government had no authority to give them away to private interests.

The South also believed that whether a new state would
authorize slavery or forbid it was a matter for the people in that territory to decide for themselves.  The South never insisted that any new state had to be a slave state, but it opposed the Northern position that any new state must be a free state.

As Northern states gained a majority in both houses, they

The South was faced with either paying high tariffs and receiving no benefits from the revenue or buying artificially high-priced Northern goods.

Northerners had announced that they would not be bound by the
Constitution. What you had was the rise of modern nationalism fighting the original republic founded by the American Revolution.  So  regardless of where you were born, you might be a Southerner philosophically.

t3_dlf74,1285960362,blahquabats,t5_2qh1u,Music,,False,"I like just about anything if it's done well or interestingly, so here are a few I've found.

Eastern Europe is great for hard rock. I recommend [Coma](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbL942M0OrU), the Polish band (there's also a Romanian Coma which used to do all sorts of [ska-like](http://www.youtube.com/user/comaofficial#p/u/16/VTsjwqymeHg) stuff but which now sticks mostly with [the harder stuff](http://www.youtube.com/user/comaofficial#p/u/4/S-da0-GoBaI), and which in any case isn't as good as the Poles).

I would like to repeat someone else's suggestion of [Distemper](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ft01ltAlicU) for a fun sort of Russian ska-gypsy-punk mix.

[The Corries](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1sDd0GjMm0) are an excellent old Scottish folk band that I like to listen to when I crave a powerfully sincere voice.

I'm a bit of a Hungarian fanboy. As such, i can offer a few magyar musics. [Hiperkarma](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKMnHmbQzYM) is a fun hyperkinetic rock-ish group (one of my favorite things about foreign music is how easily they break what you think about genres). As part of Eastern Europe, Hungary is best at heavy or doomy metal like the godfather of Hungarian metal [Kalapács](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUmBvxIFAtA), or the droney [Nevergreen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANF69JKIVc0), but [Tűzmadár](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYwWqBvy8XE) is a pretty great power metal band, if you're into that sort of thing. For straight-up rock, it's hard to get better than the powerhouse [Tankcsapda](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sagxCNjoQJY). And then there's [Aljas Kúszóbab](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwylx9-ikEg) for a more pop-punk feel.

I'm a huge fan of Latin American folk rock, especially the vallenato/cumbia of [Carlos Vives](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKq42-YoOUg) and [Cabas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROO3EB-9MIQ). but I would suggest just getting a super-mix of merengue, bachata, salsa, samba (someone else mentioned [Bossa Cuca Nova](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuY7BVD6sSg), and i heartily second the suggestion), and whatever else you can find from the caribbean and latin america. I sincerely believe that if only one language group should be allowed to make music, it should be Spanish-speakers. I guess the Portuguese speakers can come too. Speaking of which, [Skank](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azi92Wlv9BY) is fun Brazilian ska-punk-whatever.

Other exciting Spanish things include [WarCry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IFZpM9hOpU), good ol' power metal. And that song contains the absolute best power metal scream of all time. If you don't have time to listen to the whole thing, skip forward to 5:18 and sit back. [Mägo de Oz](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j25-RjaP__w) is extremely fun folk metal.

Other people have covered Japanese bands pretty well... The Pillows are fun, Shiina Ringo's got a great voice, and everyone likes to use English just for fun, but it's all kinda weird.

The preeminent rock band in China, [Cui Jian](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmcH0pJQUOs), didn't get that way for no reason.

I'm not a big hip-hop guy, but I truly and unironically enjoy [MC Sniper](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTq2wmkfdLI). Something about Korean makes all shitty genres (hip-hop, house, pop) bearable and even enjoyable.

&gt; Of course not every single one was. There were mandates set up that were violated, Palestine was considered a sovereign state and its sovereignty was violated.

Palestine was *never* considered a sovereign state.  Never!  The last time there was a sovereign state in Palestine was long before anybody called it Palestine (The Roman emperor Hadrian renamed Judea to Palestine in the 2nd century to spite the Jews who had revolted against him).  The last sovereign kingdom was the Jewish Hasmonean kingdom that Pompey conquered in the 1st century BCE. 

&gt; This is inflammatory. Hamas has condemned suicide bombing since at least 2007. Israel does not recognize Hamas, thus undermining democracy in Gaza. Either Israel is at war with Gaza, and is in violation of article 4 of the Geneva convention; or it is an occupation and the blockade is illegal.

Any sources for this condemnation of suicide bombing?  

Hamas does not recognize Israel.

t1_c113uhp,1285965264,Aesir,t5_2qh17,geek,,False,"**Prime example:** I used to work part-time in a local travel store. People would come in daily to purchase power adapters for there electric devices so that they could be used in foreign countries with different voltage levels and plug styles. We sold both plug adapters and power transformers. Plug adapters that simply allow for an American device to be plugged into a foreign socket never cost more than $10 and are usually closer to $5. If your device requires 120 volts, but your in a country with 240 volt sockets, then you need to buy the $30 to $40 transformer so that you don't fry your device.

Now the beauty of modern electronics like computers, cellphones, cameras and the like is that they come with chargers that will automatically accept both US and international voltages. There is no need to buy the transformer, all you need is the cheap plug adapter that's country specific. This is why every time that a customer would come to the counter with a transformer I would ask them what it was that they were planning on taking with them on their trip. The vast majority of people were taking things that did not require the expensive transformer and almost everyday I would save a customer $40 or more because they had NO IDEA that those power bricks that come with many electronic devices almost always accept a wide range of voltages. 

Now the owner of the store would have LOVED for me to sell a $40 item to each and every customer, but because we knew certain things that the they didn't we felt obligated to share with them what we knew. You see I had expertise that the customer was lacking and rather than taking advantage of that gap in knowledge, I ensured that the customer was buying only what they needed. 

Could they have found a use for that transformer? Maybe. Did they need it? Certainly not. They demonstrated a certain amount of trust in me when they asked what they needed specifically for their trip to Europe or wherever and I never took advantage of that trust to increase the profits of the store. Had I attempted to sell them that transformer when nothing that they were taking required it I would be ripping them off, plain and simple. 

What would be the point of my position at the store if I expected the customer to know everything about travel power adapters and foreign power infrastructure before they came in? Surely I could be replaced by the equivalent of an ATM if that were the case. 

There are those out there who feel justified attempting to take ever bit of money that they can from a customer, even if it means selling them something that they don't require or can be found for far less, maybe even free. We on the other hand recognized the value in treating others with respect and not taking advantage of the customer's ignorance.

No it's saying that someone shouldn't be enslaved to people who lend them money. If someone can't pay that's a failure on their part, but it's also a failure on the part of the lender who gave them money without examining the risk sufficiently. That's why we have the concept of credit rating too, which is part of the issue here.

&gt;Whether D was a dick or not doesn't really come in to this issue at this point

It does when you abandoned the metaphor and examine the reality where a lot of the income going to the state assumed a certain level of market activity that now isn't happening because of the current meltdown.

&gt;And C is giving way too much stuff to E and quite honestly can no longer afford it.

That is wildly inaccurate. Governments largely exist to transfer money to businesses. There's a reason why we all have the same defensive forces, and it's because the mythology of the state is required to explain why you're giving money to business in the form of bailouts or even just government purchases. 

I'll also note that [France and Germany aren't exactly saints in this situation](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/world/europe/30iht-turkey.html).

&gt;While E can repeat that D is a dick, it just doesn't really enter to the equation here.

But my point here is that there are options other than what's being proposed and what's going on now is just uncritical acceptance of the advice of people who caused the problem in the first place. Advice that bundles actual remedies with solutions that they would just like to see happen.

&gt;Yes but you're taking it out on A via C, neither of which was abusive

The solution isn't to just sit by and do nothing, or even in this case help them.

Jon Stewart is of Jewish extraction, with Middle Eastern features, a shrimpy Levantine stature and unmistakable Armenoid bone-structure. Rewind 70 years to Nazi Germany and Stewart would be tossed into the concentration camp as a non-white and Sanchez would be treated just fine.

Germany's main ""foreign workers"" during World War II [in the era before Turkish immigration] were Spaniards and Portuguese. Anyone ever hear of Spaniards and Portuguese thrown into concentration camps?

Of course not. (Yet there were hundreds and hundreds of thousands of them in Germany at the time-period.)

So Rick Sanchez would have been treated well, whereas Stewart would have been beaten up, called a ""filthy Middle Easterner"" and thrown into the back of a truck.

Rick needs to tone down the ""oppressed minority"" bullshit when he's descended from the white men and not from the slaves. (That would be like George W. Bush talking about oppressed blacks in America and saying 'We oppressed Americans.' No, asshole! You're descended from the slaveowner. You don't get victim status, moron.""

Likewise with Sanchez. ""Sure, my ancestors were the white Europeans who owned blacks and Indians. But it's all the same. We're all oppressed 'Hispanics'.""

No, brickhead. Your ancestors were the ones in the white plantation owner suits, ordering the blacks and Indians around. You don't get victim status. If Hitler wouldn't have thrown your ass in a camp, you're white. Period.

t3_dlku5,1285969238,Rebbit_Frog,t5_2qqjc,todayilearned,,False," I wrote this essay when my American government teacher asked us if we thought the United States was a Christian nation.                                    
                                    Is the United States a Christian Nation
Absolutely not. Many people believe the United States is a Christian nation based on their own religious beliefs. As I look back and read the facts of our founding fathers, they dictate otherwise. I have to wonder what they thought our country would become for the future generations.
In the first Amendment of the Constitution it forbids Congress from making or enforcing any law that is in support of ANY religion. It is the primary law of the land; “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” Our founding fathers wrote this Constitution; therefore they had no intention on the United States being a Christian nation.
In the 1796 Treaty of Tripoli it states that the United States was “In no sense founded on the Christian religion.” It was written under the presidency of George Washington and Signed under the presidency of John Adams.
The only Bible ever to pass through Congress was the Aitken Bible which is an Americanized, edited version of the Bible. The war with Britain cut off the supply of all Bibles to the United States with the result that on September 11, 1777, the Continental Congress passed a motion that would have instructed its Committee of Commerce to import 20,000 Bibles from “Scotland, Holland or elsewhere.” This, however, was not a final vote. A second motion was made to pass an actual resolution to import the Bibles, but was postponed and never considered again. A later attempt to have Congress buy these Bibles and give them to soldiers being discharged was rejected by Congress. 
Thomas Jefferson said to Baron von Humboldt in 1813 “History furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free civil government. This marks the lowest grade of ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will always avail themselves for their own purpose.” Thomas Jefferson wrote the Wall of Separation letter on January 1, 1802 stating his urgency in the separation of church and state.  In 1814 he wrote a letter to Dr. Thomas Cooper saying, “Christianity neither is, nor ever was, a part of the common law.” Thomas Jefferson believed “Christianity was founded on fables and mythology.” Although Thomas Jefferson believed in a Creator, his concept of it resembled that of the God of Deism (nature’s God). He rejected the superstitions and mysticism of Christianity and even went so far as to edit these gospels, removing the miracles and mysticism of Jesus leaving only what he deemed the correct moral philosophy of Jesus. 
John Adams, another of our founding fathers, wrote a letter to Charles Cushing on October 19, 1756 saying “Twenty times in the course of my late reading, have I been upon the point of breaking out, ‘this would be the best of all possible worlds, if there were no religion in it.’” Adams served as the sixth president of the United States from March 4, 1825 to March 4, 1829. He took the oath of office on a book of laws, instead of the more traditional Bible, to preserve the separation of church and state.
Benjamin Franklin wrote in Poor Richard’s Almanac “In the affairs of the world, men are saved, not by faith, but by the lack of it.” He goes on to say, “Lighthouses are more helpful than churches.”
James Madison wrote a letter to Wm. Bradford on April 1, 1774, “Religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprise.” James Madison later wrote a letter objecting the use of government land for churches in 1803 saying, “The purpose of separation of church and state is to keep forever from these shores the ceaseless strife that has soaked the soil of Europe in blood for centuries.” 
In conclusion, the United States was not founded to be a Christian nation. Our founding fathers may have been religious but look at where they came from. They fled Europe in search of a new land to get away from the religious dictatorship. Based on the facts of our founding fathers it is proven that the United States is not a Christian Nation. If our founding fathers based our nation on Christianity then they would have put some kind of reference to Christ, God or even Creator in the constitution.""Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man &amp; his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, &amp; not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof', thus building a wall of separation between Church &amp; State.""

t1_c1149rd,1285969760,Drooperdoo,t5_2cneq,politics,,False,"Jews, to me, are like the British. I've loved every individual Jew I've ever met, but am a little ambivalent about them as a group. Likewise, I respect and personally like all Brits, but think that Great Britain has done some really disreputable things for a really long time.

My respect for Jews is grounded in my respect for their intelligence, their humor, their humanity.

My feelings of ambivalence arise from their occasional lapses: Like their behavior during the slave-trade. It was based in the Netherlands, because that's where Jews flocked after Spain expelled them. Black nationalists are actually right when they say that most of the slave ships were Jewish-owned. They made tons of money in the blood diamond racket, the slave-trade and a million other disreputable endeavors. 

Like pornography. Upwards of 95% of the pornography trade is run by Jews. Even more horrifying is the kiddie porn trade, which is run by the Russian mob [who, outside of Russia, are mostly Jews with names like Yevgeni Greenblatt, Boris Silverberg, Sasha Lipschitz, etc.]. In fact, the seminal book on the Russian Mob was originally entitled ""The Jewish Mob,"" but the publisher made the journalist change it. 

To be fair, *inside* Russia, the mob is mostly Armenians and Chechyns. But *outside* Russia, it's historically been a predominantly Jewish enterprise, since Jews could acquire passports more easily, and already had an international infrastructure set up for them. They used the networks and liquid assets set up during the diamond trade to funnel other stuff internationally: like child pornography, illegal weapons, drugs, white slavery, etc.

In 1998 Israeli writer David Weinberg wrote a series of articles, calling Israel the white slavery capital of the world, and many subsequent journalists have agreed with him (citing all the Eastern European girls being kidnapped and waking up in brothels in Tel Aviv). Likewise, Jews run the Ectasy and Heroin trade in most major US cities.

So, yes, they're intelligent. But sometimes that intelligence is used for good [Einstein, Jonas Salk] and other times it's used for evil [like when Meyer Lansky created the infrastructure for the modern America mafia].

They've been great civil rights leaders helping blacks, and they've been slave-traders *selling* blacks.

They've been cosmospolitan internationalists decrying the evils of the nation-state, and they've been nationalistic zealots doing everything they could to maintain their own nation-state.

Like all great characters, they embody at one and the same time, all the greatest aspirations of Mankind and all of its shortcomings.

But, then, all great peoples do the same. Only tiny people are totally consistent. What did Walt Whitman say? ""I contradict myself? So be it. I contradict myself. I am huge. I contain multitudes!""

It is safe, developed, and relatively well off.  On the other hand, Ramadi was like a shithole.  Which of these is indicative of Iraq?  Would you judge the entirety of the US based on the gang warfare between the Crips and Bloods?  Would you judge the US based on Martha's Vineyard?  Neither would be helpful.

Just Some Of The History of Experimentation on Human Guinea Pigs

1931 - Dr. Cornelius Rhoads, under the auspices of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Investigations, infects human subjects with cancer cells. He later goes on to establish the U.S. Army Biological Warfare facilities in Maryland, Utah, and Panama, and is named to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. While there, he begins a series of radiation exposure experiments on American soldiers and civilian hospital patients.

1932 - The Tuskegee Syphilis Study begins. 200 black men diagnosed with syphilis are never told of their illness, are denied treatment, and instead are used as human guinea pigs in order to follow the progression and symptoms of the disease. They all subsequently die from syphilis, their families never told that they could have been treated.

1935 - The Pellagra Incident. After millions of individuals die from pellagra over a span of two decades, the U.S. Public Health Service finally acts to stem the disease. The director of the agency admits it had known for at least 20 years that Pellagra is caused by a niacin deficiency but failed to act since most of the deaths occurred within poverty-stricken black populations.

1940 - Four hundred prisoners in Chicago are infected with malaria in order to study the effects of new and experimental drugs to combat the disease. Nazi doctors later on trial at Nuremberg cite this American study to defend their own actions during the Holocaust.

1942 - Chemical Warfare Services begins mustard gas experiments on approximately 4,000 servicemen. The experiments continue until 1945 and made use of Seventh Day Adventists who chose to become human guinea pigs rather than serve on active duty.

1943 - In response to Japan's full-scale germ warfare program, the U.S. begins research on biological weapons at Fort Detrick, MD.

1944 - U.S. Navy uses human subjects to test gas masks and clothing. Individuals were locked in a gas chamber and exposed to mustard gas and lewisite.

1945 - Project Paperclip is initiated. The U.S. State Department, Army intelligence, and the CIA recruit Nazi scientists and offer them immunity and secret identities in exchange for work on top secret government projects in the United States.

1945 - ""Program F"" is implemented by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). This is the most extensive U.S. study of the health effects of fluoride, which was the key chemical component in atomic bomb production. One of the most toxic chemicals known to man, fluoride, it is found, causes marked adverse effects to the central nervous system but much of the information is squelched in the name of national security because of fear that lawsuits would undermine full-scale production of atomic bombs.

1946 - Patients in VA hospitals are used as guinea pigs for medical experiments. In order to allay suspicions, the order is given to change the word ""experiments"" to ""investigations"" or ""observations"" whenever reporting a medical study performed in one of the nation's veteran's hospitals.

1947 - Colonel E.E. Kirkpatrick of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission issues a secret document (Document 07075001, January 8, 1947) stating that the agency will begin administering intravenous doses of radioactive substances to human subjects.

1947 - The CIA begins its study of LSD as a potential weapon for use by American intelligence. Human subjects (both civilian and military) are used with and without their knowledge.

1950 - Department of Defense begins plans to detonate nuclear weapons in desert areas and monitor downwind residents for medical problems and mortality rates.

1950 - In an experiment to determine how susceptible an American city would be to biological attack, the U.S. Navy sprays a cloud of bacteria from ships over San Francisco. Monitoring devices are situated throughout the city in order to test the extent of infection. Many residents become ill with pneumonia-like symptoms.

1951 - Department of Defense begins open air tests using disease-producing bacteria and viruses. Tests last through 1969 and there is concern that people in the surrounding areas have been exposed.

1953 - U.S. military releases clouds of zinc cadmium sulfide gas over Winnipeg, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Fort Wayne, the Monocacy River Valley in Maryland, and Leesburg, Virginia. Their intent is to determine how efficiently they could disperse chemical agents.

1953 - Joint Army-Navy-CIA experiments are conducted in which tens of thousands of people in New York and San Francisco are exposed to the airborne germs Serratia marcescens and Bacillus glogigii.

1953 - CIA initiates Project MKULTRA. This is an eleven year research program designed to produce and test drugs and biological agents that would be used for mind control and behavior modification. Six of the subprojects involved testing the agents on unwitting human beings.

1955 - The CIA, in an experiment to test its ability to infect human populations with biological agents, releases a bacteria withdrawn from the Army's biological warfare arsenal over Tampa Bay, Fl.

1956 - U.S. military releases mosquitoes infected with yellow fever over Savannah, Ga and Avon Park, Fl. Following each test, Army agents posing as public health officials test victims for effects.

1960 - The Army Assistant Chief-of-Staff for Intelligence (ACSI) authorizes field testing of LSD in Europe and the Far East. Testing of the European population is code named Project THIRD CHANCE; testing of the Asian population is code named Project DERBY HAT.

1965 - Project CIA and Department of Defense begin Project MKSEARCH, a program to develop a capability to manipulate human behavior through the use of mind-altering drugs.

1965 - Prisoners at the Holmesburg State Prison in Philadelphia are subjected to dioxin, the highly toxic chemical component of Agent Orange used in Viet Nam. The men are later studied for development of cancer, which indicates that Agent Orange had been a suspected carcinogen all along.

1966 - CIA initiates Project MKOFTEN, a program to test the toxicological effects of certain drugs on humans and animals.

1966 - U.S. Army dispenses Bacillus subtilis variant niger throughout the New York City subway system. More than a million civilians are exposed when army scientists drop lightbulbs filled with the bacteria onto ventilation grates.

1967 - CIA and Department of Defense implement Project MKNAOMI, successor to MKULTRA and designed to maintain, stockpile and test biological and chemical weapons.

1968 - CIA experiments with the possibility of poisoning drinking water by injecting chemicals into the water supply of the FDA in Washington, D.C.

My wife and I are both 37.  This is our first child.  It wasn't an accident, we decided to have a kid.

But now we have a home, and careers, and things have slowed down and we realized that our lives night to night have become routine.  We realized that this is it... as much as we can talk about traveling across Europe, and all the other stuff we talk about doing, but never often get to do (because of money, work, etc) we realized that these were just things we talked about to make our future seem more optimistic then it really was.  

We came to realize that what we were doing, night after night, was basically it... for the next 30 years, this is our life.  It seemed empty, and shallow, and seriously fucking boring.  

We didn't have a big conversation about it, but yet it wasn't spur of the moment.  We finally realized we wanted our lives to be about something other then ourselves, and that we had enough to share with another.

t1_c115jh4,1286005234,[deleted],t5_2qh1e,videos,,False,"This thread was discussing the punk side of hardcore ([hardcore punk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcore_punk)). In short, it was musical genre born in the late 70s/early 80s characterized by a super-fast tempo and often having anti-establishment lyrics. It was inspired by a variety of genres, from early punk to post-punk to heavy metal to noise rock on the music side, and paired with the counter-culture message from a variety of status quo-defying movements around that era (hippies, black rights, the political mess in the US and Britain).

Hardcore punk was the original ""hardcore"" genre. It served as an influence to just about every genre that was born in the 80s and afterwards. Even within the hardcore movement, there were different ""schools""/scences; that is, a band from hardcore had a very, very different sound from a California band, and a completely different sound when compared to a British band, and these were also different from Swedish bands, and so on. For example, the Boston scene had faster tempos and a more raw sound ([SS Decontrol](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dnLC3RAvA) than California bands (like [Fear](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQM00K24qG8)). Britain's [Amebix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nN4mOUrgbn0) had a very gloomy sound which was present in almost every other British band. [Disorder](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcIWSms1gxI)'s music, as its name implied, was pure disorder. It was almost completely dissonant. Sweden's [Shitlickers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h406z7bS-eg) had the traditional extremely-raw sound of Swedish bands. It was pure and utter (yet beautiful) mess.

Another interesting thing to note was that European hardcore punk bands dealt with anarchism more often than not, and the bands were made by lower-class people; whereas the US punk bands had middle-class kids and the lyrics were not as ""crude"" or direct or harmful towards ""the system"" as their British counterparts.

Metallica was initially (and incorrectly) considered a ""hardcore punk"" band when in its early stages due to the raw speed and sound of their music. Same for Slayer. The entire thrash metal movement borrowed the speed and attitude of the hardcore punk movement and the... **complexity** and gloominess of heavy metal, and fused it all together. Metallica did a cover of Discharge's [""The More I See""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgJDpfm9dcM) ([Metallica version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRZ0TTJbUAA)) and Slayer used to do a live cover of Dead Kennedys' [""Holiday In Cambodia""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KTsXHXMkJA) (though I can't find their version). Similarly, Anthrax was also inspired by the punk movement.

I'll go back to the thrash side in a bit.

Around the mid-80s death metal was created. Again, early proto-death metal bands like [Possessed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6FZBIZ0Xbs) combined the metal sound of thrash and made it even more aggressive, borrowing, once again, from some hardcore punk bands, primarily the bleakness and growling sound of bands like [Discharge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk9v6AM1hUk). Then came actual death metal with bands like [Death](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l79HbNhSnsw) and [Sepultura](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxnVuvywUUQ). Sepultura specifically was heavily inspired by hardcore punk bands, doing a couple of covers and later releasing albums with very noticeable punk elements (1993's Chaos AD).

Incredibly enough, music would get even more extreme with the birth grindcore with bands like [Napalm Death](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esgh_tyH3Uc) and [Terrorizer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjviWgLQLe4), and early crust bands like [Disrupt](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkprusF5la0) [Concrete Sox](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWzbiK9EnFI) (notice the thrash-sounding elements in this song). Around this time black metal was also in the process of creation, which, again, also had some hardcore punk influences. Bathory's debut [Blood Fire Death](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYnstGB3rM) had some crust elements, as well as Darkthrone's [early material](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBwu83RR6ZU). [At The Gates](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF0U77bm9mc) also cited punk bands as influence, the singer went on to create crust punk band [Skitsystem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYg1Qnl-Efo) when ATG disbanded.

Ah, I forgot. Also, around the mid-80s, crossover was born. [DRI](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZfKu_8a9ds), [Suicidal Tendencies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoF_a0-7xVQ), [Corrosion of Conformity](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF4Nkh0kbNo) and [Poison Idea](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQGn5ZZJ_TQ), to name a few, despite being considered punk bands, borrowed (oddly enough) the cleaner, more straightforward sound of thrash metal and fused it with the punk speed. It was a clusterfuck of different kinds of mixings happening.

Anyway, ""hardcore"" bands of today (like Between the Buried And Me) are not actually ""hardcore"" per se, but are rather given that term incorrectly because they don't fit any of the other genres (though I would still classify them as metalcore). There is no doubt they were influence in more than one way by extreme metal bands of the late 80s/early 90s, but *HARDCORE*, used correctly, refers to hardcore punk.

Also, I really think that if your assumption of being so highly self-educated is coming off as waaay too pretentious.  

How can you quote data and information from places like ""policeofficersteps.com"" and ""policejobsinfo.com"" and assert them to be credible sources?

Your argument is very weak. You point out a few publicized individuals that happen to be highly scrutinized over what amounts to opinions and, therefore, you conclude that since they had an Ivy-League education, then everyone who has an Ivy-league education must be guilty of the same shortcomings.  It's the ""one bad apple ruins the whole bunch"" fallacy.  While I agree that the people you alluded to hold dumb ideological opinions, that in no way is grounds to declare them uneducated or unintelligent.  

Colleges aren't a scam, at least the traditional colleges. The ""university of phoenix"" and other diploma-mills could largely fall under a ""scam"" as you put it.  While it's true college is not for everyone, that does not mean it is only a means to an end.  College, to me, does more than educate in the traditional sense. It's an education in social interaction, networking, financial responsibility, and independence as well.  It's true you don't need to go to college to accomplish all of this either, though. But, a degree is a document that establishes credibility.  In this world, that is the only currency that matters.

You need to be more specific when you state what your ""real world achievements"" are and how they are equal to or greater than what completion of formal education is.  You condemn postsecondary education (and secondary as well, perhaps?) but you offer no evidence to why or how taking the contrary path of not attending college is a no worse exhibition of knowledge or intellect.

And last I checked, if you excel on the testing requirements for Ivy-league and similar schools, then chances of acceptance is higher.  Outside of that, at least obtaining an average or close-to-average score on the ACT/SAT will get you in just about any state university of your choosing.  And those scores are not terribly difficult to get.

Mmmm... Denmark and Germany in particular did some pretty sweeping changes due to their economies not working ideally in the 90s and 00s. The big change in Denmark was almost completely dismantling the bureaucracy around hiring &amp; firing *while actually improving the social safety net*. Very clever mix of capitalism and socialism in my opinion, and it's working extremely well.

&gt; I'm not advocating Spain default, BTW that would make things a lot worse for them.

Fundamentally there are 4 ways out of this (or any sort of combination or milder variation of thereof):  
a) Spain slashes government expenses  
b) Spain increases taxation to get more revenue  
c) Spain gets more loans with promises to reform themselves (this kind of is a delayed version of A or B)  
d) Spain defaults  

I guess you're implying that some sort of Hitlerian public works program? (I'm not using this in a negative way, there was a very good reason Hitler was very popular early on)

&gt; In this world, including Europe. At the very least that's the socialist line. That's what a ""worker's state"" is supposed to be, to replace the council of capitalists with a council of the proletariat

Definitely not the way the only successful quasi-socialist states roll. Basically there's a great deal of wealth transfer from the wealthy to the poor, but beyond that *everyone* wealthy knows that the way to create money is to allow the capitalist system work while policing its excesses. This means generally rolling with the punches of the system, and then punching back once you're back on your feet (US seems to be doing this latter part quite poorly for example).

&gt; There have been cases when that isn't the case. 

Yes of course, tons. Most of Finlands government companies made profits for very long times. Problem was that it never lasted, and because of the way government worked, they successfully hid 10+ years in a typical case before something was done, often burning away every bit of profit they ever had made. So even if they can work in the short them, our experience implies that they generally don't work in the long term.

&gt; Which brings us back to my central point as to why the general strike is necessary, that the neoliberal answer is treated as the only answer.

Because it has worked so damn well in so many places. Also, few places are *purist* neoliberal - think how much the Nordic Countries, South Korea etc meddle with the economy. Still, there haven't been any comparable successes using any other model among developed countries (France perhaps, but it'd be more or less the only one).",1,t3_dl91y,True,t1_c115smp,0,False,1,1426496788,,,c115smp,0,0
t1_c115e89,1286009079,height,t5_2qh1s,Economics,,False,"There's actually extensive literature on the topic of the money multiplier and why it is not applicable. Post Keynesians have been talking about this for almost three decades.

Charles Goodhart states the following on the money multiplier (he also argues against the MM in his 1989 book):

&gt;“...simple observation of the way that central banks and money markets actually behaved would reveal that this was the exact reversal of the truth. The process started with the Central Bank determining its official short-term interest rate, in pursuit of its current policy objectives. The demand for bank borrowing, at the chosen policy rate, was the main determinate of the growth of monetary aggregates. Given M, **the multiplier worked effectively in reserves, to determine the amount of base money that the authorities had to make available to the banking system to sustain their initially chosen interest rate”** (Goodhart, 2004, p.3)

This is supported by such statements as the following (this is a representation of central bank behaviours in other countries as well):

&gt;”The Reserve Bank has no prescribed target for the level of settlement balances [reserves], supplying whatever amount is needed to keep the cash rate near the target (RBA, 2003, p.4)

Furthermore a previous Reserve Bank Governor stated the following during the 1980s:

&gt;”When the dust has settled and statistics collected, it will be seen that there is a reasonable relationship between the cash base ... and bank deposits. IT is this relationship that has traditionally been referred to as the multiplier between money base and money supply, but as the forgoing suggests, causality between the two variables is a complicated process and not a mechanical one, as estimated equations for the multiplier would imply. **The main channel of causality runs from interest rate to deposit growth and then cash or bank reserves**. The multiplier shows a simple supply relationship but that is because it leaves out the chain of causality” (Macfarlane, 1984, p.116)

Of course we can arrive at the conclusion by other ways as well:
If the central bank is the monopoly issuer of reserves,
Then it can either set the price or the quantity of reserves but not both.
We know that the central bank sets the price, therefore it must allow the quantity of reserves to ‘float’. 

Central banks in maintaining their target rate will actively defend their price and accommodate the demand for reserves, because otherwise transactions to and from the treasury (which destroys reserves and creates reserves, respectively) and banks being interest rate inelastic will cause overnight rates to be volatile, driving it up or down depending on the reserve position of the banking system.

Furthermore all banks do when they create a loan is create bank credit, which is convertible into state money (currency, reserves). Banks don’t need deposits prior to making a loan because loans create deposits as a matter of accounting – deposits exist either from government spending or from private sector credit creation, you can’t have a financial asset (deposit) without a financial liability (which had to have created the financial asset). When a bank creates a loan a simultaneous deposit is created as a matter of accounting. Reserves are sought after the fact (and are not an ex ante operational constraint) to meet reserve requirements (where applicable, this just reduces bank profitability) and as a means of settlement within the banking system.

I’ve read people argue that the money multiplier should be better thought of as a capital multiplier. As banks do require bank capital- ex ante operationally constrained – prior to making a loan, as they assign capital to ‘risky’ assets. 

At the end of the day the money multiplier is simply an ex post accounting identity. You cannot derive causation from an accounting identity, this require ‘theorising’ which interprets the identity and suggests a possible causation. Orthodox economics interpret the identity as implying that causation goes from reserves to deposits to loans. Whereas Heterodox schools (i.e. Post Keynesians) interpret it as a meaningless ratio with little to no use for economic analysis. 

In terms of links (I can search for academic references too, but I’m busy with an econometrics assignment):

t1_c114paq,1286018760,kolm,t5_2qyt6,TrueReddit,,False,"&gt; It's expensive because in the U.S. health insurance and health care have become synonymous. Insurance  is supposed to cover you for unforeseen (maybe catastrophic) events. Health care is a service, and like any other service it has a price. But since usually the insured don't pay for their service, medical providers charge the maximum that insurance is willing to cover (and beyond, so there's still some out of pocket for the patient). The prices aren't subject to supply and demand but to the providers ability to extract as much money allotted by the plan as possible. The result is a spiral of inflation in health care costs.

That would sound plausible, but:  In Poland, Czechia, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Sweden and lots and lots of other countries, ""usually the insured don't pay for their service""; actually, this phenomenon is way more pronounced there because of universal health care paid by the state.  Following your logic, they would also face the same high costs -- but they don't.  

I think a main point is leverage by monopoly.  When the state threatens to drop your drug off their coverage plan (they can do that), you go back and re-negotiate the price.  Another point is that the EU banned ads for prescription drugs.  The drug companies can't advertise -- but one can also say that they don't have to advertise, so a **major** cost factor for them is just not apparent in the EU.  

In fact, the US patient pays on average more of his health care costs personally than in any other state the professor uses.

Nations that use these solutions don't see their costs go down, they just hide them through complicated budgetary schemes and rationing.

This is flat out wrong, and if dogma conflicts with reality, it does not help to re-iterate the dogma, reality won't go away.  If the EU had higher actual health care costs than the US, we would be bankrupt.  The OECD does a really good job at assessing the actual health care costs, and the article shows that their findings are precisely the opposite of your claim.  Also, rationing occurs in the sense that they won't pay for bullshit like homeopathy, but if your life is at stake, you will get **every** treatment that the doctors approve and which could save you, regardless of costs.  They pump south of $200 000 worth of drugs into every relapsed leukemia kid, regardless of the poor response rate (less than 5% survivors after relapse).

Really? Strict laws does not create a scary country and it has fuck-all to do with religion.

A person who is willing to kill for no motive is more scary than a person who kills with a motive.

I don't really agree with. Our(world) internet does not only encompass the US and Europe. China and India and other poorer countries are coming into the fold.

The ones that do get internet access will be capable of it and that will raise the stats for IE 6.0. Then consider on a smaller scale the Small us business's.. That don't really need the best latest greatest computers and usually just buy a used computer and they don't have a ton of experience with it and just leave whatever browser is on it when they get it.

I carry a photocopy of my Irish passport with me so that when they start asking me questions at customs I can just hand them the photocopy and cut the interview short.

A: Dunno, a few months most likely.

Q: Where will you be staying while you are in Ireland?
A: Not sure, I'll probably head to one of my Aunts houses and see what happens from there..

They didn't like that until they realized I am an Irish citizen and then the tone changed immediately.  That was when it was suggested to me that I carry a photocopy of my Irish passport and present it when I land.

Backstory: My grandfather was in the Army and landed on Normandy in the second wave. By the time he was done in Europe, he had two purple hearts and a bronze star. While recovering from Purple Heart no. 2, he was doing a desk job in DC. Then, he was transferred to active duty again and was part of the Battle of the Bulge. He brought back his medals, uniform and sidearm. When my dad was young, he found the 1911 in the attic, which prompted its move to somewhere out of the curious hands of children. I suspect he knows where it is, I know my grandma KNEW where it is, but now has Alzheimers and is 95. I think the only reason it hasn't been given to me is because my dad married my mom. Her dad was on Normandy and was a doctor and medic. He came home from the war, started a successful medical practice, had my mom with my grandma, started an entire hospital with some friends, and one day, out of the blue, went to the top of his medical practice and shot himself in the head.

Western socitety is evolving from capitalsim to communism. Why is this too difficult for some people to understand?

We are technologically at the right point. We have a platform for instant communication with anyone, anywhere in the world, which is required for direct democracy on a large scale.

This is the first step towards communism - the dictatorship of the proletariat.

We'll be able to take the next step when we have Star Trek style replicators, and abolish the class divide. Such a technology will allow poeple to create designs on their computers, share them instantly with anyone, anywhere in the world, who can then have them physically produced (replicated).

Within a century,  you'll be able to torrent physical objects. This would mean an end to world hunger and poverty. The only possible type of currency I can think of is energy.

Have you heard of [molten salt reactors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten_salt_reactor) (also known as [liquid fluoride thorium reactors](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWUeBSoEnRk)) or small modular reactors like Babcock &amp; Wilcox's [mPower](http://www.babcock.com/products/modular_nuclear) or [Hyperion](http://www.hyperionpowergeneration.com/)? If not, read the links. These are the technologies that are going to be ready very soon to replace coal.

As for renewables, they do not have the energy density necessary to even come close to being a practical reality for running the whole grid, especially if we try to use it to charge electric cars and heat homes. They also only work when the wind conditions are right. The result is that they have a low [capacity factor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor), which is the actual average power output divided by the peak power output. Nuclear reactors have a capacity factor above 90% while wind is 20-40%, depending on the location. This means that a 2 MW wind turbine will only output about 400 to 800 kW, which is tiny compared to the 1 GW (1 million kW) each nuclear reactor can put out. 

To understand just how bad this is, let's take a look at the world's largest wind farm. It is called the [Roscoe Wind Farm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscoe_Wind_Farm) and is located in Roscoe, Texas. It has 781.5 MW of installed capacity, cost more than $1 billion, and covers 100,000 acres. At 20-40% capacity factor, that will average 156.3 to 312.6 MW. Over the course of a year, this will output 1.37 TWh to 2.74 TWh of energy.

The United States total energy usage is illustrated here in this diagram from Lawrence Livermore National Lab (https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/energy/content/energy/energy_archive/energy_flow_2008/LLNL_US_EFC_20081.png). Total energy usage in the US is 99.2 quads per year (note: A quad is a [quadrillion BTU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quad_%28energy%29) or 293,071,000,000 Kilowatt-hours). That means we need 29,072,643,200,000 kWh or 29 petawatt-hours.

Let's do some simple math here to estimate how many Roscoe Wind Farms it would take to output 29 PWh. That is 10,584 (for 40% cf) to 21,168 (for 20% cf) copies of the Roscoe Wind Farm. At 100,000 acres or 156.25 square miles a pop, we would need 1,653,750 to 3,307,500 square miles. To put that into perspective, the lower 48 United States entire land mass is 3,119,884.69 square miles.

Essentially, **we would have to completely cover the US with wind turbines to replace our current usage of energy**. Each one of those wind turbines is about 40 stories tall and made of steel and needs exotic materials like neodymium for the generator. A project of such scale would not be good for the environment because of all of the mining and manufacturing and land use involved.

To compare, a big nuclear reactor, like the European Pressurized Reactor, can generate 1,650 MW. At a 90% capacity factor, that is 1,485 MW. Each year, that will generate 13,008,600 MWh or 13 TWh. Therefore, to replace 29 PW of energy, we would need 2,231 EPRs. Let's assume we follow the Japanese example and put a lot of them at a single site. They have a plant with [7 reactors at one site](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashiwazaki-Kariwa_Nuclear_Power_Plant) sitting on 4.2 square kilometers or 1.62 square miles. If we put 7 EPRs per plant, then would need 319 such plants to power the US and it would only need 516.78 square miles. [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=516+square+miles) says that is **about half of the size of Rhode Island**.

This is why we need to use fission if we want to replace coal. Wind just won't work. If we try to skip fission, we will just keep using coal.

I'm pretty sure i put that in there for a reason. Maybe so someone might read it. Oh well. 

&gt;How dare you say that religious people do nothing!!

No i think i will. I worked in a catholic orphanage in the poorest part of south africa. I watched children dying of AIDs, i watched the extreme poverty stagnate the lives of everyone caught in that region

I watched the money come in from overseas catholics being spent on expensive toys the children did not need, on paying camera men to come over and film the pile of clothes religious donaters had demanded thier money be spent on. It wasnt malicious they just hadnt understood the situation, so the orphanage had to sell the excess on for very little while much needed beds and facilities were ignored.

I remember that money was spent on biblical literature and for visiting christian dignitaries to get thier pictures taken with thier suffering flock

My Dad is a former vicar of the Church of England. He is now an important part of the Anglican Health Organisation. They spend the money of the rich european christians on various health initiatives around the world. The only problem is, they don't really have enough to deal with the reality. I mean they have next to nothing. Your jaw will drop to lean how little four million euros will actually do for 300 million people.

Third world countries cannot compete with european and american imports. Thier dairy farmers go out of business because the price of american imported powdered milk is cheaper. Its paid for by the 'cash crops' like diamonds or coffee beans or sugar, whose prices are dependant on the whim of richer nations. When the prices drop because all the rich wives have enough diamond rings for a few years, those nations dont have the money to deal with the next unfortunate rainfall, and those pictures are the result. 

Its this simple. The first world protects itself by slapping tariffs and import changes on the apple the african farmer tries to sell over here because hes out of business in his own country. This allows its citizens to grow rich and provide you with a nice house, education and internet access. Feels good doesnt it?

Next to the mounting debt, famine and disease problems, charity does next to nothing. The only solution is wholesale reform of the economic system. Religions in America (the country that more or less says what does or doesnt go) provide enormous support for right wing candidates who believe protectionism is right, moral and christian. 

They vote for the people who make the world burn, who convince them that abortion and homosexuality is more important, then reassure themselves they are moral, because they give to charity. Its a generalisation, but fairly accurate

EDIT: On reflection, its unfair to say religious people do nothing. They don't do nothing, but what they do is not good enough. I'm sorry but i compare what people actually do with the intelligence they are genuinely capable of, and on the religious right they fall so far short. I can't accept, 'i don't understand the situation but my congressman is a good christian and he says hes doing the right thing, and anyway, i gave 10$ a month to charity'",41,t3_dm1nb,True,t1_c117kmw,0,True,41,1426497632,,,c117kmw,0,0
t1_c117317,1286065675,essjay2009,t5_2qh1i,AskReddit,,False,"There are only two reasons I pirate and you touched on both of them. The first is DRM, or rather the symptom of DRM which is reduced choice. I have bought something, yet I can't use it in a way in which I want to. If I buy something on iTunes I can't watch it on my PS3 through my DLNA server because of DRM. It's absurd. Im pretty sure that when I used to buy VHS tapes I could play them on more than one brand of player. It's an absurd retrograde step. 

The other issue is availability. I'm not American but there are a number of American tv shows I enjoy. The networks are more than willing to use global platforms to market these shows but don't make them available globally. Take The Office, for example. I'm a fan and season 7 has just started in the US. I've seen numerous adverts for it online. As it stands, I can't get it legally. NBC has made it impossible for me to buy it from them. In this case, where they have clearly rejected my custom, I have no moral issues with pirating it (without ads, DRM and in 720p). If you look at the pirate tv charts, availability is clearly a major driving force. American TV shows are downloaded in Europe (Lost, Heroes, 24 etc were heavily downloaded but couldn't be bought legally) and European shows are downloaded in the US (Top Gear, Dr Who and Sherlock were all downloaded heavily).

t1_c117fmg,1286066402,ballpein,t5_2cneq,politics,,False,"I never said what happened there was justifiable.  Only that this type of wonton, desperate, violent crime stems directly from the drug trade.  

Prohibition on drugs creates a huge and immensely profitable black market.  Let's be clear that the drug trade is orders of magnitude more profitable than any other type of crime.  Return on investment, even at the street level, and after costs, is in the thousands of percent.  In BC, where I live, you can earn $10,000 for driving a vehicle loaded with marijuana to Ontario, within spitting distance of the US border; it's about a 3 or 4 day trip you don't grow it, you don't sell it, you're just a courier.   The risk for this type of venture is relatively low, low enough that there is no shortage of people willing to take the trip.

Moving the marijuana across the border into the US is an order of magnitude more risky - and also more profitable.  Dealing in Cocaine jumps another order.  

Now let's look at those boat-jackers.  Say it's a $30,000 boat.  Stolen property typically sells at 20 cents on the dollar, so they might be able to fence it for $6,000 ... which is split two ways.   And the risk is much, much higher than for the guy who drives the drugs.  As a business proposition, it's far less enticing than trafficking drugs.  This is a crime of desperation, not choice.

[The UN estimates that the world drug trade in 2003 was worth around $320 Billion.](http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2005/06/30/un_report_puts_worlds_illicit_drug_trade_at_estimated_321b/)  That is a huge market, and the bigger it gets, the more players it attracts, which has a normalizing effect, which in turn makes it more attractive, and so on.  THe end result is that more and more young people look to the drug trade as a viable career path.  

This has been the case in Northern Mexico, which due to geographic circumstance, is a hub for cocaine travelling to the US.  The numbers of people involved in the drug trade there grow year after year - it has become a viable career path for many young men.  Furthermore, this trade is so profitable that the industry leaders can afford to, literally, finance a war against the Mexican police and military.  

So there is a huge amount of money in the market; and more and more players entering the marketplace everyday, attracted by the vast sums of money to be made.  You now have a whole class of people involved with the black market, to whom crime and violence become increasingly normalized.  

And then, the market hits a crisis - as is currently happening in Mexico, with the government doubling it's prohibition efforts, and the competition increasing amongst cartels, the US tightening border security, etc..  Temporarily, the costs go up, while return goes down.  The low level players are the first to feel the squeeze as the flow of easy money dries up.... They are now habituated criminals, and will look to other types of crime to supplement their income.  And you start to see desperate acts of violence like you're seeing in Texas right now.  

Nobody becomes a criminal to jack boats - it's just not worth it. That's a crime of desperation, not a viable career.  Which is why  there's no epidemic of boat jackings, or armed robberies, or car-jackings in North America right now.  The drug trade, however, is pervasive, and there is enough money available to attract new players every day.  It's an epidemic, and it's becoming more and more normalized.  And the irony is, the more successful the ""war on drugs"" is, the more profitable the business becomes.

And, the Carnegie's, the Harriman's and the Rockefeller's all helped fund train and inspire Mengele and Hitler via the Eugenics movement, with money coming from the  Eugenics Record Office in Cold Springs Harbor.  Eugenics at one point was also supported by Alexander Graham Bell, Margaret Sanger and other high profile Americans.  Before the onset of WW2 Eugenics and its supporters were responsible for the forced and/or coerced sterilization of over 60,000 Americans, 30 or 40,000 Canadians, and over 100,000 Europeans.  One of the solutions considered by the movement in the US was pressing for forced euthanization of what they considered bad bloodlines.  They were applauding Hitler right up until the rest of the world found out the extent of what he was doing and became angry.  At that point the Eugenics people starting trying to distance themselves from Germany and Hitler.

As part of my PUA transformation, my plan of attack was to lord some clubs. I've been djing/producing for a long while so I am known amongst that community. To the plebeians however, I am not- study and work mean presence has been erratic in the past.  

I became a promoter at a top club to change this. For the job, I crafted a new facebook (just under a thousand hand picked girls) where I send out one weekly event notification. In exchange, I get money, free entry for whomever i want, VIP and just generally know everyone on the scene. 

Being this involved and frequenting the same clubs has really changed my personality. My party vibe is intimidating, I do whatever I want, whenever I want. My persona is playful yet assertive and I exude confidence without being macho. I try to reflect this in what I wear. I dress up uniquely- skinny pants, fitted boldly patterned button up shirt with a skinny tie and rabens.

The confidence and club status (they feed off each other) I've gained has done wonders for pickup. Hate to boast, for the last two months I've had a 100% success rate; k-closes, f-closes and a barrel of numbers. The process is mechanical now.

I really need to write up my experiences, as I owe alot to Seddit. Teaser- Last week I picked up two eastern european girls in the smoker's den. I played them against each other and ended up with an FFM 3some in their apartment. I didn't even know one of their names.

It seems like there is something that a lot of people on reddit who are very passionate about the Israel-Palestine issue need to realise: the Israelis and Palestinians _need_ to compromise and share the land fairly. The example I mentioned earlier of South Africa is relevant. The non-white population in South Africa was degraded since the day the first European settlers arrived. That degradation was enshrined in the law from 1948 until 1994. The non-white population did not, for the most part, take up arms. Instead, they fought a war of ideas. By undermining the support for apartheid among white South Africans, the process of transformation was set in motion.

The Palestinians could seek to pursue this same path. Israeli citizens are not heartless robots. If the Palestinians peacefully opposed Israeli incursions into their land, this would be interpreted in a very different light by the mainstream of Israeli society.

So, the proof is in the pudding really. Palestinians have been trying to beat Israel by violent means for how long now? And how successful have they been? Yeah... precisely.

I'm a huge thorium and LFTR advocate and really want to see it happen. However, I think weaponization concerns are overblown. I think the plutonium economy would have made the world safer, not more dangerous, because most wars are caused by resource conflicts (especially oil). More energy means that the world will be richer and more peaceful.

&gt;Arguably this limits freedom and experience in driving

If depends on how it is designed. Maybe we could make some sort of AI-assisted driving or something like that, so people that want to have ""control"" over their car still can. And you can always go out in the country and drive all you want. For cities that have awful traffic (I live in DC and have friends that live in the SF Bay Area), AI drivers would be a huge improvement in their daily lives.

&gt;Also, a better train system should reduce jet travel, which is a massive consumer of energy. If we find that only construction, freight, and other industries that really need gas are using it, we could extend the effective lifetime of oil by a lot.

Another thing I didn't mention above that I'm interested in is synthetic fuels. We can still use jet fuel, gasoline, etc. after we have our nuclear age. But we will manufacture them in environmentally sustainable ways. For example, you can make gasoline and jet fuel by simply combining air and water (that is how plants and the Earth did it in the first place anyways). One such process is:

Step 1: Capture CO2 from the atmosphere or dissolved in ocean water.

Step 2: Electrolysis: 2 H20 → 2 H2 + 2O

Step 3: [Sabatier reaction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabatier_reaction): CO2 + 4H2 → CH4 + 2H2O (we now methane)

Step 4: Steam Reforming: H2O + CH4 → CO + 3 H2 

Step 5: [Fischer-Tropsch Process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer-tropsch):  (2n+1) H2 + n CO → CnH(2n+2) + n H2O  (if n=8, we have octane)

This process does require a large energy input, but if we have a fleet of LFTRs and eventually fusion providing extremely cheap electricity and heat, that won't be a problem. This also is completely carbon neutral because the amount of CO2 released by the jets is the same amount sucked in by the electrolysis. There are probably plenty of other potentially more efficient ways to create liquid fuels as well if we have a huge cheap source of energy. We might also be able to use [methanol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol_fuel), [aluminum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_battery), and [boron](http://bravenewclimate.com/2009/01/13/prescription-for-the-planet-part-ii-newclear-energy-and-boron-powered-vehicles/) for fuels. As the Cable Guy said ""There's no end to the possibilities!""

&gt;Of course, this is all rather unlikely, largely because of how politics and capitalism work. I suppose the EU can be a leader on this (I think they already are), but America will probably lag behind for a while.

I agree. However, eventually our current unsustainable practices will have to end by definition.

If the wife is not a virgin, she shall be executed.""), violence against gays (Leviticus 20:13, ""If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death."") and a myriad of absolutely detestable, racist, bigoted propaganda, which is then condemns in later passages, which pretty much allows you to do whatever the fuck you want, then cherry pick which scripture you regard as law. The religion is completely incompatible with progress. Almost every famous scientist, philosopher, politician and social activist was impeded by religion (namely christianity, but most abrahamic religions apply) in one way or another. Shit, Einstein famously rejected quantum mechanics, saying ""God does not play dice."" Who knows how much more that man would've accomplished if he had come to terms with the idea that the universe is dynamic. And there's a plethora of other examples, if you're thinking ""well that's just einstein"". Your lauding of faith? Absolutely fucking ridiculous. Oh yeah, we should *believe something without any proof.* That's a great idea! Nothin' can go wrong there! The reason why we've made so many advances since the renaissance is because we developed the scientific principles of observing physical phenomena and coming up with conclusions that can be replicated and backed by logical reasoning. The notion that we should blindly follow scripture written thousands of years ago, without any semblance of rationality or evidence to confirm it's wildly grandiose claims, is so laughable that I don't even pity you jesuits. Your idea that you should respect authority is twice as ridiculous. What if Gandhi had respected British authority? What if the colonists had respected Britain's taxation? If MLK had respected the authority of the McCarthyists? Authority is something that's meant to be struggled against. If we submit to authority for even one second, we lose our rights. While I agree, slander and ad-hominems are pointless, silly, and should be chastised, especially republicans that toss around that shit about the president, but I'll be damned if I let the powers that be rule over me without opposition. With the exception of his extrajudicial assassinations and human rights violations, I wholeheartedly support the president. But if he starts fucking my shit up I will not respect him, and neither should you. Saying ""God did it"" doesn't change the fact that a corrupt politician is an asshole that should be rebelled against, and though telling your friends you shouldn't carelessly mock the president (especially since the implications that he's a terrorist is extremely fucking racist) is good, telling them they should respect him because he's authority because that's what God wants us to do is fucking retarded on so many levels. 

The chapter ""Rebellion"" from The Brothers Karamazov mocked the idea of hell. It gives the example of a Russian general that, for no reason at all, stripped an innocent 5 year old boy naked, put him in a field, and let a group of hungry dogs loose. The dogs ate him alive. According to Christianity, the general is going to burn in hell as punishment. But what does this achieve? Does it erase the painful death of the boy? Does it take wipe away the tears cried by his mother that day? Does it prevent the general from committing any more horrible crimes? Does it revive the boy, letting him live a full life, experiencing everything the world has to offer? You'd think that the almighty creator would see the flaw in this schematic. And he would, but humans wouldn't, which is where the idea of hell comes from. If there was a God orchestrating all these, he'd clearly see the problem with punishing someone after they've already died. And if God really loves us, why does he create evil? God specifically states that he creates evil in the bible. Why? Why does God need evil? Why is eating the apple of knowledge so bad? Why is God surprised by the fact that they ate the apple? If he's omnipotent, wouldn't he already know what was going to happen? If so, why doesn't he prevent it? Why does he put the fucking tree there in the first place? Why does he choose to throw them out of the garden of eden? They had no free will at that point, so they had no choice but to eat the apple. If they had no free will, and God orchestrates everything, then God implicitly made his creations commit the only sin, and then punishes them and the entire human race for an act that not only did they have no choice in committing, but an act that he specifically wanted them to commit. This all points to ""God fucking hates you."" I've put this hypothesis forward to a lot of Christians, and what did they all tell me?

""God works in mysterious ways.""

Fact is, Marx was right. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people. It's the desperate attempt of the trampled and disheartened to cling to the idea that if they follow these set of rules, they'll achieve an everlasting ecstasy beyond all comprehension. It's whimsical fantasy. According to your scripture, the more we move towards secularism, the more God will punish us. But we can clearly see that Europe's quality of life is improving, while America is going to absolute shit. Christians have blocked progress at every. Fucking. Turn. When we wanted to free blacks? Christians said no. When we wanted to give blacks the right to vote? Christians said no. When we wanted to end segregation? Christians said no. When we wanted to grant women rights? Christians said no. Now that we want to give gays rights? Christians say no. In 30 years people will look back at people like you in disgust of your bigotry. You people argue against Evolution, which is pretty much scientific fact. You argue against stem cell research, even though most stem cells are made in labs, NOT being harvested from abortions. They're blinded by religion. And of course, you're going to say ""That's my point, if you ignore christians, christianity is great"" but the fact is that most Christians get their stupidity from Christianity. Some parts of the bible are great. Christ was a pretty cool guy. But for every tolerant, nice, peaceful part of the bible, there's a violent and bigoted passage that can be used to justify Christians' asshattery. It's not like these morons make up scriptures to interpret. It's all in there. If it weren't in there, they wouldn't have anything to back up their ignorance. But they do, because it's in there, because of Christianity. You seem to be one of the better jesuits. And I commend you for thinking a little bit more than other people. But you're still listening to an archaic, shitty religion that spreads intolerance. And why? Probably because your mum and dad said it was right. Because mom and dad are always accurate. 

And on the topic of your anti-abortion stance: **FUCK YOU** for making victims of incest and rape carry their rapist's baby, go through labor, pay thousands of dollars for hospital bills, and then support the kid who was born out of tragedy for it's entire life.

Re: being an American, get over it.  Honestly, with no malice intended, it'll only be a big deal if you make a big deal of it.  Galway has people from everywhere, especially in/around the uni/colleges. Learn to use your inside voice a little more, don't expect customer service to mean the same thing it does in the US, and learn to just go with the flow a bit more.
Be aware of the stereotypes, but don't *be* the stereotypes.

Re: being a female American, this may get you in more trouble.  Do be aware that despite what hollywood tells you, Irish women aren't the prettiest creatures to grace the planet.  There are of course exceptions, but you'll discover most are exceptional in the wrong direction.  What this means to you, is that you may find yourself drawing more attention than you're used to.  Before you let flattery take you places you hadn't anticipated, do look around you and establish where you fit in compared to the local average.  You'll most likely find a wildly different answer to home. 

There's a very high chance you're going to be lumped in with the erasmus students; a pan-european exchange program.  This can be fantastic if you're studying a european language, but do try to find a balance and make some irish friends, else you're not going to see anything any other budget tourist would see.  On the other hand, if you're not put in with the erasmus group, do try to seek them out.  They're a lot more prone to actually get out and see things, rather than being 'stuck in galway' for 4 months.  Balance is the key word here.

If this is your first time in europe, or you're not sure if/when next time will be, do try to apply some of your beer budget towards flights.  If you're willing to accept a level of service which doesn't rival that of a municipal bus service, you'll discover flights to the UK / continent are amazingly cheap.  I took our last exchange to scotland for a weekend when I realized she had no plans to step any further afield than Ireland.  If you can afford to spend a bit more on hotels, my last flight to Paris cost less than a good night on the beer.  While you're here to live/see/study Ireland, don't ignore that there's a lot of potential one-in-a-lifetimes €40 away.

Don't even consider driving.  It's a lot more work, and risk, than it's worth.  If you're not a complete shut-in, you'll find friends that drive.  Use them.  Use public transport (it's pretty normal here, not just for the homeless).  It's not just the right-hand-drive thing; roads here are completely different.  If you're not completely familiar with roundabouts/rotaries, they will drive you insane.  If you're not used to travelling freeway speeds on roads that may not be much wider than your car, they will drive you insane.  If you're not used to a country full of maniacs who clearly have no idea how to drive either, they will drive you insane.  And all of these will usually involve calling the rental company for a new car because you broke this one.

Studying will most likely be completely different, and quite honestly becomes one of your lowest priorities.  Don't completely blow it off, but do investigate how much of it will actually transfer home.  Also look into how things are scored; a lot of the time, 'top marks' is a theoretical maximum; you will find courses where 60% is more than acceptable, but will run completely counter to the ""must be #1"" attitude to education in the US. Also be aware that most the students you meet will be in education for practically no cost, leading to a huge difference in attitudes &amp; approaches.  This difference is difficult to describe, but you'll know exactly what I mean very quickly.

Finally; shit's expensive.  Deal with it, get over it.  Save as much as you can now.  Save more than you can now.  Cut every corner you can, now, and while you're here, and don't be overly afraid of a sensible amount of debt to go home to.  This isn't the most sensible financial advice you've ever heard, but for most people, this will be a once in a lifetime experience.  Make it count.

tl;dr; many nationalities have issues with the US govt &amp; a lot of its actions. Very few nationalities have issues with Americans themselves.  Learn to tell the two apart, and have fun.

COSCO also leases the port of Piraeus. COSCO is a (partially) state owned corporation, so what the Chinese government is doing is to protect and expand it's investment. 
The fact that Piraeus is the closest EU port to China compounded with the fact there are serious reforms going on and Greece is moving to a market structure more close to capitalism (it was too socialist even for China before the EU-IMF restructure plan) means Greece is now a place of opportunity for China.

If you are eager for beer-related destinations at the end of the day, Belgium can't be beat. We rode to all of the Trappist abbeys in Southern Belgium and are eager to go back to the north sometime soon. The trip included a visit to the West Vleteren abbey in Flanders where the monks brew what is alleged to be the best beer in the world...only available at the abbey. It was delicious. Overall Belgium provides amazing natural and cultural scenery and too many cute bed and breakfasts that you'll have a hard time deciding where to stay (we camped).

The trip in Alsace started in Basel where we were easily able to meet up with the eurovelo 5 route on the Rhine along the French and German borders. This route is great because not only do you get a daily option of which country you ride in (and which cuisine you eat for dinner), but you can also mix it up between riding on the path by the river (very flat) or heading into the hills in the wine country in France.

When I'd visit Cairo 15 years ago you'd hardly ever see a ninja, and only sometimes see a woman wearing a hijab. Most women walked the streets with their hair free, even when dressed Arab style. Ninjas were looked at as strange, and even the hijab was thought to be a bit odd.

Today, ninjas are everywhere, and the great majority of women at least cover their hair. Those that don't are the ones who are now seen as odd. This is terrifying.

&gt; Where did you get this idea?

Before we had universal male suffrage in America, only men who owned property could vote. This wasn't so much of a problem at first because land was in such abundance, but soon whole populations of men were deprived of the right to vote because there was an influx of European immigrants who began to concentrate in cities, where they didn't own any land. So they fought for the right to vote, just like blacks and women did. The [Dorr rebellion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorr_Rebellion) is an extreme example of this. It was one of the main civil rights movements in this country, though it's often underappreciated.

I could easily turn that back around on you. Just because you believe it's not force doesn't make the idea any less stupid. Many wage slaves in America instinctively feel otherwise. The system is rigged against them.

Furthermore, have a current account deficit could simply mean that there is a lot of foreign investment going on, as opposed to runaway spending and low savings rates which are the reason for American deficits. The deficits of the Asian Tigers in the 70s and 80s are examples of this.

In short, this may not mean what you think it does. Buying government debt is not the same thing as buying the country.",2,t3_dm3jq,True,t1_c119i6v,0,False,2,1426498559,,,c119i6v,0,0

I remember reading this case study in my international marketing class in business school as a major backfire for Nestle, otherwise before a pretty well respected brand. This is one side of the story, the other side of the story is not quite as evil. Nestle formula was selling well in developed nations, the marketers in charge of the formula brand were tasked with expanding into Asian markets. The thing is many people at Nestle did believe that their formula was a healthy and safe alternative to breast feeding (this was the 1970s). Tasked with trying to sell into a new market, the executives in charge based on market research decided to expand where their formula could be used best, where sometimes breast feeding isn't always an option: into hospitals. This technique proved to be successful so they expanded that effort into doctors offices and hospitals throughout Asia. 

However, this took a life of it's own, and soon mothers everywhere believed that they had to use formula, that it was safer than breast feeding. It's what they use in hospitals, so it has to be right thing to do for my baby, right? Nestle executives were thrilled with the huge success of the formula so they kept on selling it, buying more advertising, promoting how great and safe their formula was (Doctors use it, so should you!). Of course they didn't take in consideration that third water supplies are not like they are in the west. In Asia they didn't have to follow any sort of FDA guidelines, which meant shortcuts in the manufacturing process to keep up with demand. Soon, babies starting dying everywhere and Nestle is the most evil company in the world. Last thing you want your company to be known for is killing babies, which is exactly what happened with Nestle's aggressive expansion and ill-researched marketing strategy. To this day, there are major boycotts of the Nestle brand throughout the world and they have lost major market share in most of Europe. This was a case study of the dangers of expanding your product internationally without taking in regional living conditions and culture. 

TL;DR: if your going to sell a new product, in a country you've never sold before, make sure it doesn't kill babies. ",15,t3_dm7ic,True,t1_c119js6,0,False,15,1426498579,,,c119js6,0,0

A Swedish friend of mine had an interesting hypothesis about why the US can assimilate Muslim immigrants.  Life is hard in the US.  If you're an immigrant you're working two jobs and barely getting by.  You're concentrating on how to pay your bills and ensure your children will have a better life.  You have no time to think of politics or the like.  European countries are much more generous.  Europeans don't work as much.  They have more time to think, to think about how society is excluding them or whatever.  No matter how wealthy a Muslim becomes in Europe, most likely they will still  be ""othered.""  In the US money speaks.  If an American Muslim can rise to the middle class his children will be accepted into American society.  So they work hard to get into that class.  Basically, it's hard to become radicalized when you're working 70 hours a week.

Diesel gets better mileage largely because it is a denser fuel - it contains about 20% more energy per volume.

edit: if you have a subscription to the Economist, they do an interesting analysis here: http://www.economist.com/node/10984681?story_id=10984681

some relevant text:

&gt;So, two decades after vanishing in a puff of smoke, diesels seem poised to reappear on the American landscape. Your correspondent will be among the first to plonk down his cash the moment diesel versions of family runabouts arrive. But he wonders where all the fuel will come from if Americans take to diesels as much as they’ve embraced hybrids.

&gt;Fact is, there’s a global shortage of the stuff. That’s why, shorn of tax breaks, diesel costs so much more than petrol. Over the past year, the average price of diesel in America has risen by 117%—twice as fast as petrol. While both carry the same taxes in America, diesel now costs 60 to 70 cents a gallon more than regular gas.

&gt;With spring in the air, factories, office, stores and homes in the chillier northern half of America will have started to turn down their oil-fired heating systems. Meanwhile, farmers and truckers (big users both of diesel fuel) are in the midst of their slackest season of the year. Couple that with an economy that’s lurching towards recession, and you would be excused for thinking the price of diesel—which comes from the same part of the barrel as heating oil—would now be falling.

&gt;Actually, if anything, it’s continuing to rise. That’s because of the burgeoning demand from Europe, China and India.

&gt;It doesn’t help that the catalytic crackers used by oil refineries in America are optimised to produce as much petrol as possible—typically about 50% of every barrel. Diesel accounts for only 15% of the rest, with the balance used to produce heating oil, jet fuel, heavy fuel, liquid petroleum gas, asphalt and other products.

&gt;Refineries in Europe and elsewhere tend to use hydrocrackers that produce 25% petrol and 25% diesel. They would like to produce more diesel than they currently do, but that would mean producing even more petrol than they need. At present, they export their surplus to America.

&gt;So, if America switched to diesel cars in a big way, the Europeans would be even more awash in unwanted petrol than they are today, and might have to dump it elsewhere or even idle some refinery capacity. Either way, the global price of diesel would soar still further.

&gt;Meanwhile, back at the pump in America, diesel currently costs 20% more per gallon than regular petrol. When that premium reaches 35%, the difference in fuel efficiency will equal the difference in price—and there will be no economic reason to make the switch.

t3_dm99n,1286146356,eyal0,t5_2cneq,politics,,False,"I'm from Israel.  I'm familiar with all the ""scams"".  Here's a quick primer:

Intro:
-----

After high school you go to the army and when you get out you're excited to finally be free and you're poor because the army pays like 70USD a month.  From here there are two options: go to university (5-10k USD for a year), go travel (like O.E. in Aus/NZ, $500USD/mo).

Both cost a lot compared to what a 20-year-old has so most go work.  The money to be made in the USA and Europe is much easier but riskier than in Israel.  Relative to Israelis, Americans give money away.  A lot of young people try to get a visa to go to the USA.  The embassy tries to filter them out but many make it through.

The jobs:
---------

**Carts:** Little booths in the mall walkway where Israelis sell paintings, potpourri-scented pillows, massage stuff, etc.  The booth workers don't make dick but they aren't paying income tax so not too bad for them.  I knew a guy that worked his way up and had 200 employees, a supplier for carts in malls around the country.  At age 22/23 he made some $250,000USD in a year or two.  He didn't pay taxes either.  I'm still jealous.  If you feel that an eye-mask that smells like tea is worth $10USD then go ahead and buy it.  No one stole your money but you could have haggled.

**Door-to-door:** Mostly just the paintings.  This one is in Europe, too, especially Amsterdam.  Like the carts, it isn't really a scam except that the artist might not be the starving student that you imagine.  If you like the painting no matter who painted it and the price is right, I don't see the problem.

**Movers:** This is the big money for the boys.  Bust your ass for up to a year.  Sleep in the moving van while on the road to save cash.  These guys can make $6000USD a month (not paying taxes, again) and the boss is doing even better.  Eventually they learn that they can get to the destination and say, ""Oh, you've got stairs?  That'll be another $2000.""  Now your shit is hostage in their truck.  Even Israelis living in the USA don't use Israeli movers.  If you get stuck, say that you've called the police and the INS.  Have police show up.  Ask to speak to the boss, talk about deportation and tax fraud.  You might get your move at a discount.

My family knows a guy that ran some movers.  All of the kids got their passports blacklisted from visiting the USA again and deported.  The boss went to prison for a year or two.

**Au pair:** Mostly girls.  The Israelis that moved to the USA went there for the chance to make big money.  This gives the USA a skewed Israeli population because not all Israelis are chasing after dollars and America but the ones there are.  So you've got Israeli families, both parents work, and someone has to stay home to watch the kids.  Preferably speaking Hebrew.  Au pair lives or rents a flat with her au pair friends and ekes out a living.  Cost of living and shopping usually mean she doesn't save much anyway.

**tl;dr**: Except for the movers, most of it is ""caveat emptor"".  Try not to be dumb with your money.",5,t3_dm99n,True,t1_c11a9jq,0,False,5,1426498913,,,c11a9jq,0,0

Once western Europe got it's hands on some ancient writings, such as Aristotle, in the 11th and 12th Centuries there was an explosion in learning. The people who read these works were monks, like Peter Abelard, as they were the only literate class. Christianity may have done many things wrong, but it did not knowingly or willfully destroy and bury these works. From the 12th Century onwards we see the founding of universities in Europe. Many of these were born out of the cathedral schools, where monks and clerks (from the original cleric) were trained and educated. 

From the acceptance and willingness to learn from 'heathen' works in the late Middle Ages, it seems that Christianity was not totally averse to the works.

There wasn't a lot of Greco-Roman statues around Europe at this time, at least there is no evidence in the writings we have. As I said the censoring of nude statues took place during the Renaissance, well after the Christian rise to power. It was, in actual fact, a response to the Protestant Reformation which urged the Popes to be more 'pious'. 

You're argument that if it was nudity in a Christian context it was accepted, but that there are no secular nudes does not stand up to scrutiny. There was little to no secular art at this time. Nearly every piece of art we have is to beautify the church and church buildings. We have some portraits and other artifacts based around the royal court, but even today there is very little nudity displayed in works about such things.

Listening to his clip that's not at all what I heard him imply.

His use of the language ""It started small, and it started with seemingly innocent ideas..."" implied that at one point in time all that existed was nice, safe, innocent indentured servitude (and not the indentured servitude that actually existed), and that the slave trade in all of its horrors did not even exist until the regulations compounded.

Hence his comparison of the modern day healthcare system to the slave trade of old: we had a perfectly innocent and fine system (that was his stance during the debates, that it wasn't broken) and all the regulations will result in a horrific system *just like how the slave trade system came about*.

&gt;One view, first propounded by Enlightenment philosophers, asserts that the Church's doctrines are entirely superstitious and have hindered the progress of civilization. Communist states have made similar arguments in their education and propaganda in order to inculcate a negative view of Catholicism (and religion in general) in their citizens. The most famous incidents cited by such critics are the Church's condemnations of the teachings of Copernicus, Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler.

&gt;In opposition to this view, some historians of science, including non-Catholics such as J.L. Heilbron, A.C. Crombie, David Lindberg, Edward Grant, Thomas Goldstein, and Ted Davis, have argued that the Church had a significant, positive influence on the development of Western civilization. They hold that, **not only did monks save and cultivate the remnants of ancient civilization during the barbarian invasions, but that the Church promoted learning and science through its sponsorship of many universities which, under its leadership, grew rapidly in Europe in the 11th and 12th centuries. St.Thomas Aquinas, the Church's ""model theologian,"" argued that reason is in harmony with faith, and that reason can contribute to a deeper understanding of revelation, and so encouraged intellectual development.** The Church's priest-scientists, many of whom were Jesuits, have been among the leading lights in astronomy, genetics, geomagnetism,meteorology, seismology, and solar physics, becoming some of the ""fathers"" of these sciences. Examples include important churchmen such as the Augustinian abbot Gregor Mendel (pioneer in the study of genetics), Roger Bacon (a Franciscan friar who was one of the early advocates of the scientific method), and Belgian priest Georges Lemaître (the first to propose the Big Bang theory). Other notable priest scientists have included Albertus Magnus, Robert Grosseteste, Nicholas Steno, Francesco Grimaldi, Giambattista Riccioli, Roger Boscovich, and Athanasius Kircher. Even more numerous are Catholic laity involved in science:Henri Becquerel who discovered radioactivity; Galvani, Volta, Ampere, Marconi, pioneers in electricityand telecommunications; Lavoisier, ""father of modern chemistry""; Vesalius, founder of modern human anatomy; and Cauchy, one of the mathematicians who laid the rigorous foundations of calculus.",8,t3_dmcv3,True,t1_c11axod,0,False,8,1426499227,,,c11axod,0,0

during the enlightenment, hundreds of years after petrarch, some european intellectuals took great issue with the catholic church, and used petrarchs anti-german dark age metaphor as if the italian christian had meant it as a condemnation of catholicism

You honestly need a better plan other than ""help me get to another rich country"".  If you have no blood ties (close relatives that lived in other country), a lot of money, or very specialized skills, you are going to have to work hard indeed to get out.

One note about ""Europe"" is that it is really quite a lot of countries with very unique host cultures and languages.  If you move anywhere in Western Europe, start working on the host language of your desired country *NOW*.  Unless you're going to England or Ireland, the English language makes you an outsider.

First target a region that you like the most.  If you don't LOVE the country you're about to move to, your adventure will be short lived as living in a foreign country day to day requires you to completely reboot your life and start it over.  You will tuck tail and run as the grind of daily life and possibly a foreign language and culture take their tolls.  If you haven't already, travel as much as humanly possible to see the world and hopefully fall in love with a place where you can become a native of that culture.  Research the laws and cultures of your adopted homeland to death.

Once you have targeted your host region, look at what skills are most in demand in that region, and try to figure out what specialties you have been trained and schooled in will fit that jobs list.  Most countries do have a desired skills/jobs list, you better read them.  Tailor your resume to show your strengths in your chosen/wanted position.  Then you can begin the arduous task of going hat in hand and sending out resumes on the internet.  If you have no residency for your targeted country, employers are going to view you as an unloved smelly fish so you really better have a perfect CV -- you have converted your resume to a CV already, right?  If not, start looking into what the host country wants in a CV.

You sound young, but that is ok.. really the best time to move.  But get some travel under your belt and focus.  Focus focus focus, or you'll just be seen for the naive, unwashed, uncultured youth that you are, and your dreams will go nowhere.  Sorry if this advice seems a little unstructured, but I'm having to paint on a bit of a blank canvas here.

France was an industrial, urban nation while the United States (Which were much more of a confederation of states rather then a single nation) was a rural, farming area, comparing the two is comparing apples and oranges.  Of course the two had separate goals and roads to realizing those goals. 

That being said, the American revolution was directly responsible (in some small way, of course, not the main reason) for inspiring the people of France to revolution against their hierarchies, and the wording of Frances bill of rights and revolutionary documents often borrowed from American sources (in turn who were often inspired by the French)  There is a reason that Thomas Paine found such a voice in America.

America was not a ""Cess pool"" as was often reported, it was decentralized and sprawling, with no military or federal bank,  and it was made that way by design, as it was fitting for the area at the time.  Americans had total freedom of speech, freedom of the press and right to arm themselves.  Newspaper subscriptions were ridiculously high, and the nation on a whole was politically aware and active.  They were the first to successfully overthrow a European hierarchy and were often resented for it, the belief being that their blind devotion to ""Classical Liberalism"" were unfounded and ridiculous.  And thus news reports (which had to go through the state first, before they could be published) were often heavily biased against them.  The notable exception of course, being France. edit: Oh fuck, dont forget the separation of church and state, that was pretty big too.

And I am an Anarchist!  Please, leave your ignorance and bias at the door when you come into /r/history. 

as an aside, it is silly to say the French were a bastion of hope for all peoples, as they continued to hold about a half dozen colonies around the world, exploiting entire countries in a way that is not considered slavery for some reason, but really is.  The French and all European powers at the time were totally fine with slavery and oppressing native peoples, so long as they did not have to directly see it.

Wages aren't flat because of some conspiracy or because of the policies of some Executive Branch administration.  Wages have been flat because demand for blue-collar labor in the US (at least at a US price point) has been imploding for decades now.

In the 1940s/50s, Europe had seriously damaged or wiped out its industrial infrastructure in World War II, to say nothing of killing or maiming workers.  India wasn't industrialized.  China wasn't industrialized.  Russia and China had both gone communist and basically hamstrung themselves as economic competitors.

If you wanted industrial work done, you were going to pay out the nose for a US worker to do it.  Demand for blue-collar labor relative to supply was very, very high.

Rebuilding happened.  Europe came back on-line.  Children were born.  Major third-world countries started on the path to industrialization.

In around the 1970s (well, earlier, even), demand for manufacturing in the US falling off relative to available labor caused infighting between people who wanted more blue-collar jobs than were available.  This is where you get stuff like the [1967 Detroit Riots from](http://www.67riots.rutgers.edu/d_index.htm) -- policies from whites put in place to keep available blue-collar labor for themselves, violence on both sides, etc.

In the late 1970s, market-based reformers under Deng Xiaoping in China started the gradual shift away from a command economy.  China slowly starts moving towards dumping its population -- over four times the US population -- onto the labor market.

The development of safer and more efficient good transport helps this process.  Many people who would otherwise have been even more impoverished, working at small-scale farming in China start moving to manufacturing and jobs going overseas to China.

The development of the computer and the spread of mechanized devices allows automation to a much greater extent than was previously possible.  Now, one man (a backhoe operator, or a repairman for a robotic device on a production line) can do the work of many with shovels.

It becomes harder and harder for someone without specialized skills that are in demand to find someone who wants to employ them.  A US worker who wants to maintain a middle-class standard of living has to be better than any robot, overseas worker, or computer, many times over.

The construction layoffs and manufacturing layoffs weren't produced by the banking crisis.  They'd been steadily coming for a long time.  It was just the recession that clobbered businesses hard enough that they couldn't keep trying to find ways to keep on running.  Layoffs disproportionately get clumped up during downturns...but an awful lot of these were layoffs that were coming no matter what.

Yeah, I'm a fiscal conservative.  But if you want to discount what I'm saying on those grounds, go up and dig up a fiscal liberal like Robert Reich.  He was Clinton's Secretary of Labor, and was pointing this out (a bit less bluntly) twenty years ago:

&gt;In addition, Reich used the office as a platform for focusing the nation's attention on the need for American workers to adapt to the new economy. He advocated that the country provide more opportunities for workers to learn more technology, and predicted the shrinkage of the middle class due to a gap between unskilled and highly skilled workers.

Or from his blog:

&gt;But here's the real worry. The basic assumption that jobs will eventually return when the economy recovers is probably wrong. Some jobs will come back, of course. But the reality that no one wants to talk about is a structural change in the economy that's been going on for years but which the Great Recession has dramatically accelerated.
&gt;
&gt;Under the pressure of this awful recession, many companies have found ways to cut their payrolls for good. They’ve discovered that new software and computer technologies have made workers in Asia and Latin America just about as productive as Americans, and that the Internet allows far more work to be efficiently outsourced abroad.
&gt;
&gt;This means many Americans won’t be rehired unless they’re willing to settle for much lower wages and benefits. Today's official unemployment numbers hide the extent to which Americans are already on this path. Among those with jobs, a large and growing number have had to accept lower pay as a condition for keeping them. Or they've lost higher-paying jobs and are now in a new ones that pays less.

What I'm saying is that the US seeing a lack of interest in blue-collar labor at the prices a US assembly-line worker could command from the world in 1950 is not the product of any of the policies that you've listed.  Yeah, there's always friction over how much by way of extra taxes the well-to-do should pay, and I think that Iraq was an inefficient use of resources too, but you can't accurately wrap up all the fiscal policies that you don't like and blame the decline of demand for US blue-collar labor on those -- not only did they not cause it, the processes were set in motion for a decline to happen decades back, and policymakers were well aware of the process a long, long time ago.",1,t3_dma71,True,t1_c11b7xk,0,True,1,1426499359,,,c11b7xk,0,0

t1_c11b6q2,1286177608,mogdit,t5_2qh1i,AskReddit,,False,"^ Truth again.

I used to about to feel the same for no more than 1-2 years ago. I can barly recollect any memories from the previous 5 years from that point because my life consisted only of routines of work, go home and eat and play games. Sleep, work again next day, etc.... no memories of doing anything else tbh.

This might sound silly, but my life changed DRASTICLY after some deep thinking about what I want to do with my life and how I want to live my life. Then I saw the movie called  ""YESMAN"" with Jim Carrey, which very much sparked something inside me, and wanted to try what he did in the movie:  To say YES to things, even if they might sound scary.
In the start, I started to attend to parties which was allright.. but not that special.

But then, things started to happen, and within 1,5 year by now I've lived a more lively life than I've ever done in my previous 20ish years!
This is what have happened in the past 1,5 year:

- Moved out for the first time to the city ( I got asked at a party if I wanted to join in a collective )
- Learned to read, talk and write Japanese. Again, because I said yes when someone asked if I wanted to join in.
- Made LOTS of new friends and acquaintances, both local and abroad.
- Traveled to California, Sweden, England and almost Netherlands with my new friends.  Never had so much fun before. Again, because they simply asked me if I wanted to join
- FINALLY dared to go out with of my passions in life: Cosplay -  I've been attending around 4-6 differents conventions in Europe within a year. Each time, made so many fond memories and met new friends!
- I stood on the stage infront of thousand cosplayers, when I have a fear of stages, winning the cosplay competition for best equipment/weapon.
- Met my first GF, learned the hardship of first breakup, and grew equally much after wards from it.
- Met lots of girls, especially anime/lolita/cosplay girls and became 'cough' popular for some reason in their eyes &gt;_&gt;;
- Met a person, who is today my best friend who we support eachother no matter what.
- Learned ALOT of important life lessions, especially with girls. I used to be afraid to talk with girls, but today I've often been in the center of attention by 3-7 girls, very cute and hot ones, without feeling small and insecure.
- Speaking of insecure... in over 12 years, I've been believing that I would always be alone and ugly due to my appearances after a tough puberty. This ruined me ALOT, belive me. henche why I developed to become a sad person with no much life. This self view of myself changed over time when I had the opportunity to meet so many people, and they didnt show any sign of reject or problems with my apperance. My confidence have grown and I've learned that heart and mind is what matters in the end, and I'm no longer afraid to show myself and who I am.
- On a small sidenote, I used to have only 20 pics or so of me on FB due to that insecurity, but now I have over 300, which more or less others who have tagged me. 

The list goes on, and  I know for certain that it will not stop any time soon, I wanna learn to dance, encouraged to play piano again, travel to japan, china, pretty much anywhere I can, etc.. :)

All this because I started to rethink and stop being afraid of taking opportunities as they come up.  

However, as wackyvorlon writes: ""It's not all sunshine and roses.""  
I second that; Lots of shit have happened as well, hearts have been broken, tears have flown, I've been shouted on, angered on, and I've had some long on going arguments, fell into small depressions regular, running away from unwanted memories, etc. It can be really though sometimes, but I'm prepared for it and my mind is set on to expand my horizontal view, experience and learn as many lessons as much as I can. Nothing is that bad, that it won't be good for nothing.

I'm proud of myself and what I've archived after these few years, even thou I'm a bit heartbroken atm (had a break up a month ago), I can look back and smile, because she, along with so many great people I've met, have been a part of my journey and helped, giving me opportunities, to open myself up and become the more colorful person I am today.
The more I experience and live out my life, the more interesting person I become, when I share my life with others.

Sooo... needless to say &gt;&gt;&gt;  Break the cycle, by seizing opportunities. Watch that movie if you want to, its a fun one even if you dont take it seriously.  Small changes in your life today, will make a bigger outcome tomorrow. You never know whats gonna be behind a new door. 

Oh, and Hi reddit!  (second post, former digg lurker) Sorry for weird english and text of wall, but this topic have been a life changing event for me I wanted to share for a long time. Plus I like reddit.

In France there's something called the [PACS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacte_civil_de_solidarit%C3%A9) (Pacte Civile de Solidarité). You do not have the right to adopt children under this. It was designed to apply to all types of unions (not just same-sex) - so basically this applies to everyone and marriage only to opposite-sex couples. It is still discrimination. So much so that loads of French straight couples refuse to marry out of solidarity, and will PACS instead. I count myself among them. 

I was there during the debates. Only one right wing parlimentarian voted for it. The Catholic Church threw all their weight behind the opposition. One of the acts of the opposition was to brandish a Bible in Parliment and saying ""remember this book?"". Religion is illegal in Parliment in France so she was censured, but as you can see religion, even today in a secular non-religious society, is still capable of fucking with peoples' lives. My gay friends in France cannot adopt children. Thanks to a bunch of abstinent old men. 

In the UK it's more liberal. It's pretty much marriage except in name only. There are a few differences though but same-sex couples here don't complain very much about it. I was at a Civil Partnership ceremony not so long ago (one of my friends finally got hitched with his partner of five years). It was a lovely ceremony. Nor religious anything involved. But if you ask the religious here, they will call this a shocking travesty destroying society and all the other bull they are used to saying the world over.

t3_dmhny,1286188927,[deleted],t5_2qi4f,Catholicism,,False,"I myself am a convert. I went to Catholic High School, and was basically required to go to Mass. Most of the time I would just cut and smoke cigarettes, or whatever. However, the times I went, my friends would be talking and whatnot, and I would just silently pay attention to the Eucharist. I mean the actual host the priest elevates. The presence of Christ in the Eucharist is just overpowering. It is not the only thing different about the Catholic Church, but it is the main thing. Christ is present in the Eucharist Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity. In other words, He is, in some mysterious way, there as if He were sitting in the room with us, on his throne if you will! 


Anyways, zip forwards. I was the most delinquent of my whole school pretty much, or up there with the best of them. I still regret all the drugs I did, as I have a hazy memory as a result. I left the school, went on some crazy adventures through Santa Fe, Montana, Canada, Alaska, on to Europe, Italy, and Rome. I went there with a bunch of Catholic friends who were all basically delinquent in their won right! We went to study philosophy, although I was the only one who actually finished a semester. This was in 1993. In November, I met a Canadian Bishop on the steps of Saint Peter’s. He was there on his first visit to the Pope as a new Bishop. We all hung out as a group for about a week, and towards the end, it was the first Saturday of the month, and we went to the Rosary with John Paul II. It is a semi-private affair with about 1000 people max. So, they set me to sit on the aisle. This was when John Paul was still in fair health, and he walked down the aisle greeting people. He walked passed me about two steps. I hadn't really moved to be in his vision etc. But then I said to myself – no way this guy is getting past me! So I called out spontaneously the first thing that came to my mind ‘God bless you!’. A bit ridiculous to bless the Pope, but there you have it. He turned back, looked me in the eyes, reached out his hand, and patted me on the cheek, saying simply, ah, yes, ah, yes. That man was so much larger than life. Like a modern John the Baptist or something. Anyway, a few days later, we were walking after dinner in a group, it was the last day the Bish was in town. I asked for Baptism. He started telling me about RCIA and all that jazz. I was talking about then and there. I had studied in a Catholic high school for 3 years, and was studying at a Pontifical Uni. So, he declared the chapel at the convent where he was staying part of his diocese (we were like 50 feet from the Vatican walls), and baptized me at midnight on November 17th 1993.


At the beginning of 1996, I actually entered a Monastery in France, and lived as a religious for five years. I left at the end of my temporary vows. I have been all over the place – probably more than I should. France, Italy, South America, Israel... I just finished my doctorate in theology. The way Christ just grabbed my heart, he is like a Lion, I just never looked back. It is awesome.


Finally, I want to add something that is a bit technical. The Catholic Church believes (i.e., faith, not proof) that man can prove (i.e., reason, not faith) that God does indeed exist. It however requires a fair amount of philosophical formation. I personally have this formation, and find atheistic arguments illogical and sometimes ridiculous. However, many so-called believers froth at the mouth and spew dribble, making anyone who affirms the existence of god, whether through faith or through personal knowledge, appear as a fool. We don’t want to be like them, or even associate with them. On the other hand, as you can imagine, dinner parties tend to turn in a certain direction when people hear of my formation, and there is always one who wants to go for my jugular. I personally win my debates, although I do not think this means much at all (and the same goes for an atheist who wins an argument – he may be the smarter man, and the bettor rhetor, but he almost certainly does not have the proper formation, or else has argued himself into a world of inconsistencies IMHO). More importantly, I have sat down at a table of twenty to thirty atheists and agnostics who are all college educated, and had great conversations with them about the philosophical demonstrations of the existence of God. I have never once had a deep conversation with an atheist where I think they walked away considering that I was a fool. Instead, there can be a deep respect, probably because it is unusual to see someone who is both open and very rationally oriented defending the existence of God. I will say now what I often say. I can present you the arguments for the existence of God succinctly, but you will not understand them. This is because they require a very large body of philosophical knowledge in order to understand that they are more than arguments from probability, and that they are in fact demonstrations. I do not think I will go into the details here on reddit, because I do not have the time for the certain debates to follow. Suffice to say, Thomas Aquinas, when properly understood, is extremely convincing. Biologists who claim to have philosophical proofs, not so much.


So, to end. I took the time to write this for you, because God is worth it, and you are worth it. I normally avoid all discussion of such things on reddit, since one must play whack-a-mole, so I decided to make a real-name account to post this one-off. God is very, very present. To everyone. Just ask Him (frickin humiliating the first time!).

I specifically said it was **perceived** as a genuine Crusade (capital C) by the Muslim world, especially after George W. Bush used the word himself.

What I was alluding to was that while Europeans may feel they have become the victims of Islam because a bunch of Muslims emigrated there and wear burqas, Muslims also feel victimized by Europeans and that's more due to you know... bullets, tanks, missiles, lots of dead people. It just seems that of the two claims to victimhood, the Muslim one might have more merit and the Europeans seem a little disconnected from reality.

&gt; but on the other hand, people say that the hostility was already there and that conflict was inevitable.

9/11 was an attack on New York. Aside from the US, there's a good chance Al-Qaeda might have attacked the UK, but had NATO or the rest of Europe not been involved in the US response there seems to be little evidence to indicate that Al-Qaeda would have ever attacked Europe (the Madrid bombings are the only one that I'm aware of and they were directly linked to Spain's participation in Afghanistan).

&gt; if al-Qaeda hadn't attacked New York, there would have been no invasion of Afghanistan, and no invasion of Iraq.

First, free speech is not a ""vague ideal"" - it is a concrete political and social goal, encroachment upon which, no matter how well-intentioned, has been shown time and time again to lead to unintended consequences and slippery slopes.  It has been infringed upon in many European countries by paranoid, uneducated electorates and pandering politicians mortally afraid of largely imagined threats from Muslims and Neo-Nazis, and has in the past led to such outgrowths as Germany's and Switzerlands laws making it illegal to insult government officials.  It has led to bans and restrictions on books, films, games, movies, for reasons ranging from perceived incitement to violence, racism, discrimination, whatnot -- often used by various groups with an axe to grind for their own purposes.  I do not like giving tools for the suppression of my opinions to people who are not responsible enough to deal with them.

Second of all, ""we in Europe"" - **fuck you very much for claiming to speak for me and others.**  I can not stress this enough.  I am European, living in Europe.  I find European muzzle laws to be abominable, despicable, unworkable things.  I vote against them, and the politicians who support them, every time I have the opportunity.

Third, ""pragmatic"" and ""realistic"" are terms regularly used by totalitarian or authoritarian governments to silence dissent and for ""those who know better"" to guide the populace in the direction of what's good for them.  Be quiet, you, run along and play, let the experts make policy.  That attitude is undemocratic and patronizing.

European citizenry is, by and large, accustomed to centralized authority, with a few notable exceptions.  Even countries with common law traditions of open expression and individual liberties have succumbed to this.  How many countries do you know where the government / the voters trust the citizenry-at-large enough to regularly hold popular votes / referendums?

However, I don't think it's necessarily wrong to call Jews an ethnic group, per se. Race and ethnicity aren't the same thing, or at least the US Census doesn't seem to think so since the measure for Hispanic-ness is literally ""a person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, *regardless of race*,"" suggesting that if you are culturally Hispanic, that's good enough.  In order to become Jewish you have to dedicate yourself to a Jewish way of life--effectively assimilating into Jewish culture (and there is definitely a well-defined Jewish culture). It's that culture that makes you ""ethnically"" Jewish, if not semitic in origin.

EDIT: I also feel that it's important to note that there are different cultural practices WITHIN Judaism. Sephardic Jews are mostly Spanish/North African/Middle Eastern, and they have some differing customs than Ashkenazic (European) Jews. However, their Jewishness is not challenged.

You reasoning is shoddy.  The ""unifying technology"" didn't really make much of a difference, as stock markets still functioned in much the same manner then as now, just a touch more slowly.  Markets world wide still crashed, millions lost their jobs, and overall things were much worse for the folks back then than they are now.  Further, this wasn't even really a world-wide crash.

Shariah is not limited to government.  There is a spiritual sharia as well.  Sharia litereally means the way or the path.  Sharia is the path to god. Praying 5 times a day is part of the Sharia.  Fasting in Ramadan is part of the Sharia. Making Hajj at least one time in your life is part of the Sharia.  Many people misunderstand it as something like Democracy or Communism or Monarch.  A part of Sharia is government, but its more then that.

Also with Shariah, [Muslims who live in non-Muslim lands](http://www.themodernreligion.com/world/muslims-living.html) have to observe the laws of that country.  That is part of the Sharia.

So if the law requires a Muslim woman to show her face in a Bank or a Government building then that is not an issue.  The problem is when Western countries profess freedom but really don't give freedom to Muslims especially Muslim women.  There are women who are forced to cover, but by banning the burqa/niqab they are also forcing women not to cover even though it may be their choice.

Thank God, America is true to their principles unlike France or other European countries.

Also, many people say why don't the Muslims go back to the Muslim countries and live there.  The problem with that is that America and other Western Nations has influenced many of the governments (See Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and others) making them corrupt and not caring to help the people.  So they look to the West for opportunities.  Some of these Muslim countries also go further in banning the Hijab in schools or government buildings (Algeria, Turkey, Egypt, Syria).  So when this happens Muslims say, ""hey we can be a better Muslim in America or the UK instead of a Muslim country.  let's migrate"".

&gt;The dating game as it is played in Western society is tainted with attitudes that go all the way back to pre-history

I'm assuming you're in Northern America, because in my experience there isn't the same ""dating game"" in the UK (or the rest of Europe).  I can't think of anyone I know going on a ""date"".  Rather, relationships tend to develop more organically between people who share social circles, often with sex occurring early in the relationship.  

I've lived with women for all of my adult life, and none of them has ever avoided sex for fear of looking like a slut.  All of my female friends who have been in a relationship have had sex, often early in the relationship. 

I've also not experienced ""slut-shaming"" (Obviously not on the receiving end, anyway.  Male here, since I didn't mention it earlier) outside of high school.  Its just not a big deal for adults.  There's only one girl I can think of who has even come close to receiving this, and she's worked through half the guys in our workplace, passed STDs on to at least one and keeps an ordered list of their prowess.  And yet, she's not been ostracised for it.  In fact, she's one of the most popular people in the workplace, both with the men and the women.  Its a bit of a joke, but not a malicious one.  She's also now in a long-term relationship, with a guy who is well aware of her sexual history and it isn't an issue. 

Now, I'm not sure if this is a generational thing.  The UK (and rest of Europe) may have been as you describe in previous years.

It paved the way for revolutions throughout Europe and Asia, directly influencing the upheaval of monarchies and creation of rights for all man throughout the developed world. 

The American war was one about a colony fighting for fairer taxation, resulting in independence. The French revolution was the people of a superpower uniting to gain control of their own government.

I'm 38, so my high school/college-age dating years are far behind me. And yes, I am in North America.

As far as I know, young Americans still date.  Its just not something that happens in Europe.  And thinking about it, the lack ""dating"" part isn't even something new.  By dating here, I mean the social event where two people do an activity together in order to determine suitability.  It just doesn't happen.  And I don't know anyone who has done it.  My parents didn't, my grandparents didn't and my girlfriend and I certainly didn't.

In Europe, you tend to meet someone in similar social circles (Friend of a friend/at the same party/at the pub, etc.) and if you get on, you spend more time together within a group until one day you decide you're together.  I know it seems really hazy and indistinct, but... well, it is.  American dating is much more formal.  

The closest to ""formal"" in our relationships is the fairly awkward ""So... are we like, a couple now?"" conversation that happens fairly early.  

&gt;You may not be attuned to ""slut-shaming,"" since it's not something you sound as if you would engage in or condone yourself. When I was younger, there was a lot of disapproval for women who ""slept around.

For the record, I spoke to my girlfriend and she agrees with me.  Its not something we see.  It was fairly common in high school, but died off completely when I was at university.  My girlfriend didn't even experience it at school.  And she went to a snobby all-girls private school.  I really expected it to be a big deal there, to be honest.

&gt;There's also slut-shaming online, in the sense that women are sometimes reduced to non-entities by what used to be a male-oriented online culture. For example, the once-ubiquitous ""Tits or GTFO"" and the maxim that there are no girls on the internet. 

Agreed, although thankfully that seems to be dying out. 

&gt;Slut-shaming also comes into play when you talk about rape and sexual assault -- the assumption is that a rape victim was asking for it until proved otherwise, in a lot of male-dominated areas of the net.

Ugh.  Not experienced that.  Hopefully that's dying out.  If not, tell me where it happens so I can avoid it.

No one said that the Aryans spoke Celtic (although Celtic was an offshoot of the proto-Indo-European language). Nor that the words themselves signify anything. I said that the *concept* of horse ownership being tied to caste and social standing was an Aryan import to European culture.

The earlier paleolithic Europeans from which the Celts descend didn't have horses. Nor horse-culture.

It was a foreign concept to them . . . like the Greeks who initially saw horsemen from the steppes and like the Aztecs millennia later who saw Spaniards atop steeds assumed that they were strange Centaur-like monsters.

The early Greeks had no concept of horse-culture (but were later inundated by newer neolithic ideas), after which the term showed up as a caste designation . . . like Philip of Macedon's name translating as ""horse lover"".

And, no, likewise, the Greek terms ""Philos"" and ""Hippos,"" from which ""Philip"" derives were not used directly by Aryans, either. 

But the Greeks would use their later version of the language to describe a sociological phenomenon that was an import from the grassy steppes of Central Asia.

In other words, it was an accretion that happened later—after Aryan culture spread and pervaded the pre-existing paleolithic hunter-gatherer societies of Europe.

What words were used (at which time-periods) are irrelevant. What I was discussing was the new [Indo-European] ideas of caste and social-standing and how that affected modern European ideas [and ideals].

Ken Rogoff, Greg Mankiw, Alberto Alesina (all at Harvard), and other serious economic scientists do not understand economics as well as he does. Those who do not agree with him are ""mass delusional."" And perhaps Krugman's favorite line: ""I was right, of course.""

Old people being left to die? What about policy-holders being denied care? The US is being strangled by the elderly and the obese. My grandmother was kept alive against her will for 2+ years because Medicare was paying for her to be fed by tubes in an intensive care hospice/hospital.

When you come here I will happily give you:

* A place to live and a generous allowance while you get used to my country
* Schools so your children can get an education
* Health-care so you won't get sick
* Language training and help finding a job

In return, I expect from you:

* That you learn to speak the language. You can probably speak to your friends in Arabic and get by with a little English, but as long as you can't communicate in my mother tongue, I will see you as a foreigner. Of course I understand that my language is one of the hardest in the world to learn, but unless you have some kind of trauma-related learning difficulty, you should make an honest effort to get the basics down.
* That your wife works. It is extremely hard to survive and raise children on one income. Stay-at-home mothers are a thing of the past, and only seen in economically independent families. I know that it's not normal in your culture, but in order to survive here, it's critical. Otherwise you will live in poverty for the rest of your life.
* That you accept your children hanging out with locals. Not having Danish friends to support you and teach you about life here is the easy way into a socioeconomic slump.
* That you respect the laws of my country, before the laws of your home country or the laws in your religion. I don't care what your daughter wears on her head or if she's allowed to go out with boys – that's between you and your daughter – but don't refuse to shake hands with female coworkers, and don't mutilate your newborn children's genitals. You've moved here and you receive financial support from the state – the least you can do is comply with the law.

Some muslim immigrants happily take the free money, education, and health-care, without even making an effort to learn the language, make friends with Danes (the majority of us are friendly, although some will always be xenophobic), and live by Danish rules and norms. The small percentage of muslims who do this make the rest look bad.

Since people are dying on transplant waiting lists (this is something you should know, god, people will pick on anything), it's not that less people need them.

What it is, we don't know.

And why are there no donors? I didn't say people were dying because they can't pay.. The point isn't that healthcare is more expensive in Canada, the point is that it's worse. Why are less people donating? I don't know, you don't know, nobody seems to have done research. The fact is, people in the US have better access to transplants than in Europe (couldn't find any statistics for Canada). 

&gt;You also don't provide any comparative statistics relating the Canadian data to the number of people who die waiting for a transplant in the US (both on-list and those too poor to make the list).

That's really not relevant.. There are shortages in both places, which means the reason there are less transplants in EU isn't because there is lower demand. 

&gt;No one is arguing that Canadians have the perfect system, but keeping a shitty system simply because the alternatives are not perfect is plain daft.

You'll need to prove that the Canadian system is better. I argue its not. We'd switch one system to an even shittier system.

I know too much about this topic. The reporting falls short in a couple places.  
  
Having just a phone company and cable company compete is A-OK. In Europe you see some resellers, but margins are thin, and service is poor. In the future, mobile companies will also compete, as they roll out 4G / LTE networks.  
  
Every US cable company today already offers 20 Mbps (DOCSIS 2.0 technology). US Cable companies definitely want to outdo phone companies on speed (this will help them keep your cable business), but have been technically limited. They are in the process of rolling out DOCSIS 3.0 in key markets, which allows download speeds of up to 100 Mbps. Europe already has it. The US is behind, but will be DOCSIS-capable in 1-2 years.  
  
In the end, Americans don't want speed enough. It's very expensive (new customer modem and network equipment) to enable DOCSIS 3.0, and it's done based on customer demand. The US has not demonstrated a strong desire for 50-100 Mbps, and not enough to justify the investment - customers will not pay more.  
  
In fact, there are few uses for 100 Mbps, beyond occasional file sharing. And even in regions where 50-100 Mbps is offered, customers generally opt for 20 Mbps. It's really more of a marketing gimmick than anything else, to keep your cable subscription.

And one can say that the US, acted upon Japan, using the morality and conscience that was highly popular during the Imperialist era. They imposed a very unfair trading agreement with Japan which forced a country that had for a long time exerted an isolationist policy to make extensive changes socially, culturally, and politically. A small fishing town, Yokohama, is now currently one of the biggest most populated cities in Japan mainly catalyzed by Foreign traders and merchants. Most of the education systems in Japan is modeled after the West. Foreign professors and advisors were imported from Europe and US to advise the development of Japan. They modeled their first ever constitution after the West! The emperor started changing his clothes in order to fit in! The whole confucius hierarchy was demolished and equality was technically given to all! The Samurai who were in power for hundreds of years lost their political power. Culturally they were subjugated. Also your missing my point. I was talking about HOW it was affected...I have no idea really what you are getting at?

Also it's very hard to argue that friendly competition is what pushed Japan into rapid westernization. Many argue that Japan westernized in fear that if they did not they would be colonized. They would rather subjugate their own culture than another western power.

The Golden Rule was not Jesus of Nazareth's teachings, but predates him by several thousand years to the teachings of the principle of Ma'at -- ""order"" -- as known to the first Egyptian Dynasty.  It has been independently recorroborated from Mesopotamia, Europe, Asia, and even the Americas.

2. Jesus of Nazareth's teachings included hating all those who refused to accept him as their personal Lord and Savior -- even if they were your own family.  And yes, as per the writings of Luke, **hate** is exactly the word used.  They also included a commandment to slaves to obey their masters as though their masters were God himself... for only through this obedience could they hope to achieve Heaven.

Jesus's teachings **in his own words as they were written** include the message of oppression of other human beings.

Sir, I humbly submit to you that you aren't very Christian at all if you believe what you have thus far professed.

I think a lot of Americans who would like to see universal healthcare are a little concerned about how it might be implemented. For instance:

How I would not like it done: I have a friend in British Columbia who has severe migraines to the point where she cannot work some days, and the amount of bureaucracy that she had to go through in order to see a neurologist was truly staggering. This same province has many people who are effectively uninsured due to a lack of capacity in that area.

How I *would* like it done: another friend of mine lived in Korea and has a chronic back condition. His has herniated disks bulging into clusters of nerves in his back. It's bad.

When he lived in South Korea, the cost of all of his medications as sold to him through the government insurance programs was &lt;$10/month. His medications to cope with the pain include lyrica and methadone. Though I cannot remember his figures exactly, his bills for his medications are greater than his rent, not including some of the experimental therapy they're giving him (something to do with injections of a steroid and lidocaine).

In Korea, his medications were cheaper, and he never encountered any issues with capacity with in the healthcare system. Medications are largely paid for by the state in ridiculous quantities but you pay full price for things like annual physicals. You pay to be enrolled but it's a pittance compared to American insurance. I think that's what I would like to see.",1,t3_dms7c,True,t1_c11e0rk,0,False,1,1426500670,,,c11e0rk,0,0

Me too.  When we use the term ""white"" in this sense, it is purely colloquial and is used purely for convenience.  It refers to the look of the people, and I have no problem with that whatsoever.

But my attitude changes when people start talking about ""white history.""  That's different.

There is no white history.

&gt;However the term ""white"" in itself doesn't bother me anymore than the term ""black"" does even though ""African"" is a better term.

Yea.  I actually like black and white as terms, because they're simple and humble.  ""African"" is more fancy-pants, and it's also a distortion because someone who is a 7th generation black American is by no means African.  So black refers to the general looks and so does white, and I have no problem with people pointing at me and saying ""that guy looks white"" or ""that guy is white.""

t1_c11exfs,1286270042,[deleted],t5_2qh13,worldnews,,False,"&gt;Is the term proto indo european retarded too?

No.  This one is OK, since it's discussing geography.  Geographical features are much more real than vague ideas like ""race.""  Scientifically speaking, when you talk about race, you're not actually talking about anything specific, since race is not part of real scientific taxonomy.

Quoting http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_taxonomy:

&gt;Biologists once classified races as subspecies, but today scientists question even the concept of race itself.

So race is not a scientific term and color of the skin is obviously not a scientific term either.  Thus phrases like ""white history"" make no scientific sense.

&gt;Hitler took this concept of discrimination, called himself something exotic, and then started killing the lower classed people.

They weren't actually lower classed.  Hitler was killing the same kinds of human beings as himself.

&gt;Neo nazis just want to discriminate, they don't really care how they justify themselves.

I don't know about other neo nazis, but the ones in Russia are afraid that what they think of as ""Russians"" are becoming extinct.  Thus they react violently to scare what they perceive to be non-Russians out of Russia.  They base their own identity on a bogus concept and when that bogus concepts falls apart in the real world, they get scared.

That's natural.  We all experience our identities being threatened.  The ultimate threat is our own death at the end of this life.  All this stuff is scary.  However, rational, and indeed noble arya individuals are able to rise to meet this fear inwardly.  Instead of allowing this fear to dominate our psyche, we can become something bigger and broader than just one identity.  To transcend one's own identity is the very definition of ""arya"".  Trying to protect the physical vestiges of one's identity by threatening other people's lives is the opposite of arya mindset.  It's very ironic that neonazis want to be called ""Aryan"" but their actions and their mindset are pretty much the opposite of what a true Arya would demonstrate.

So they don't just want to discriminate.  Discrimination is a worthless goal that no one has, not even neonazis.  People want to *protect* what they *think* they are -- their *identity*.

In reality people are much broader and much different from what they imagine themselves to be.  In essence, our ideas about our identities are our limitations and delusions.  They are the hooks and the buttons that allow the world to emotionally manipulate us into submission.  

Consider this simple example.  The vast majority of men identity with their balls.  Thus, if someone threatens your balls, you greatly fear, correct?  Why?  It's because we cannot conceive ourselves without balls.  It's a very important part of being a man.  It's an important part of having a masculine identity.  But this very pride of our own balls is exactly what allows other people to manipulate us.  That's exactly how torture works.  Someone grabs your balls and you are ready to talk and say anything just to get it to stop.  See?  Identity is our weak spot when we become obsessed with it and when we are desperate to maintain it.  But identity is also what makes life interesting when used in *moderation*.

&gt;Do you really think those illiterate thugs know about the proto indo european culture? Or that they consider the ancient Indian civilization to be on par with their own ancient ""Aryan"" people?

Who knows what exactly they consider.  However, they aren't as dumb as you make them out to be.  They're just scared.  They're not total retards.  They can read.  They do take pride and interest in their culture.  They probably have little binders where they collate every study like this one.  So during the breaks between beating the piss out of all the ""non-Russians"" they likely go over these and lament how they are on the verge of losing their greatness and how they must work hard to protect their purity and all that other shit.

Hitler was warped, but he wasn't a moron.  He was just unwise and deluded in many important ways, and he was also scared internally.  Be he wasn't totally dumb.

Mush talking about Pakistan:

&gt; **We** [Pakistanis] unfortunately have a culture of vendetta and vindictiveness in Pakistan.  

&gt; **We poisoned Pakistani civil society for 10 years** when we fought the Soviets in Afghanistan in the 1980s. It was jihad and we brought in militants from all over the world, with the West and Pakistan together in the lead role.

About Kashmir 

&gt; The West blames Pakistan for everything. Nobody asks the Indian prime minister, Why did you arm your country with a nuclear weapon? Why are you killing innocent civilians in Kashmir? Nobody was bothered that Pakistan got split in 1971 because of India's military backing for Bangladesh (which declared independence from Pakistan that year)

Here is where he says the quoted line 

&gt; SPIEGEL: Does that give Pakistan the right to train underground fighters?

&gt; Musharraf: Yes, it is the right of any country to promote its own interests when India is not prepared to discuss Kashmir at the United Nations and is not prepared to resolve the dispute in a peaceful manner.

Nuclear weapons are part of Pakistani ""pride""

&gt; This capability is our pride and it will never be compromised.

Like a slave to the west, he says

&gt; Now you expect Pakistan to pull out a magic wand and make all of this suddenly disappear? That is not doable -- **this will take time**.

Trying to be a military expert

&gt;  The fourth and worst blunder would be to quit [Afghanistan] without winning. Then militancy will prevail not only in Pakistan, India and Kashmir, but perhaps also in Europe, the United Kingdom and in the United States. That's my belief.

My counterpoint: the US can let Taliban govern the country and keep bombing it from space. There is no competetion - the US does not even need any bases in Afghanistan - they can bomb Afghanistan from Central Asia. The reason they are their is their fucked up psychosis about wars. 

There is no value in the argument that leaving Afghanistan to the Taliban will enable militancy elsewhere. The US can leave Afghanistan anytime, and keep bombing it for 40 years, as long as Taliban/Pashtuns support terrorists. 

Pakistan is fucked 

&gt; If you hear the new statements from the West that they plan to withdraw their troops and leave Afghanistan in 2011 ... Pakistan needs to find a strategy **for its existence** venting. 

haha, yes you assholes, you do. Just like after 1971 when you  overnight became Islamic in 1973 constitution. 

About himself

&gt;  I am happy here in London. I am earning good money, but Pakistan is my country.

He cannot return because he will be arrested and perhaps even hung for all you know, like Saddam, you never know ( it has happened with another ex-ruler - Bhutto). Plus, no politician in India, not in central role, EVER talks about money. And this guy is a general. Those who compare India and Pakistan are off their rockers.

t3_dmzok,1286294553,[deleted],t5_2qh61,WTF,,False,"As an aspiring teacher, or preacher, this is sickening.
I am torn between the two occupations because I sense there is a great need for both.
 One one hand, people are looking for intellectual, as well as emotional, answers pertaining to faith. I know this because I feel this myself and see ""artistic philosophizing"" everywhere (conversation, books, movies, etc.) Ravi Zacharias and other apologists have helped me think of Faith in new ways. But that generation is aging, an entire praying generation is dying out. Who will take their place. At the same time, if students can not READ if they not not even _think_ in a way that bears any semblance to critical thinking then they will becomes slaves to the ideas with the best advertising team or the deepest pocket books. Truth will be undefineable in their minds and the entire purpose of evangelism and apologetics will be lost. I don't think I can ""change the world"", I know I'm speaking of lofty things, but let me explain why I consider literacy so important and even connected with people's ideological and theological understanding.

There is a difference between protecting a child from something he or she is not ready to accept psychologically. We shouldn't aim to drop the entire weight of the world's evils on the shoulders of the unready, causing permanent psychological or emotional harm. At the same time, this does not mean we should censor to create this bubble of a world-- a evil-less, soul-less, faux-notion of reality. This is a world filled with rape, murder, temptations, all-kinds of sexuality and ideas-- how you interpret them is up to the values and judgement of the individual and I would say is best taught in Churches and at home. Too often parents expect the schools to do ALL of the educating and refuse to help out any at home. When you expect the school to teach your values _for YOU_ do not complain when there is simply an OPTION to read something that does not fit your values.

Working in classrooms for a vocational program during high school and for tutoring presently, I cannot express enough my support for this woman's advocacy of Young Adult/ Juvenile Literature. There is a place for the classics (I love some ""Great Gatsby""!) but we must get students to the place where they can and will read first. Educators scramble trying to find ways to get students involved ""learning styles"", glitzy presentations, independent projects mean nothing if they do not build the skills students need and students do not see the connections between the disciplines. It took until my junior year for a teacher to explain to me that literary periods corresponded with historical periods as well! English is really artistic philosophy and applied history (just as science is applied mathematics. There's a reason science was once called ""natural philosophy"")-- students just don't see the connections between disciplines anymore. This affects every aspect of our nation's life.

It affects our political base, an uneducated public is very dangerous. It affects America's historical understanding, making us liable to repeat mistakes. It affects our theology. There's a reason why the early Protestant church emphasized literacy-- those who do not think and read are often weak in their faith and rely on face-value wisdom and happy lies. Without seeing how literature corresponds to different ideas, different world-views, we fail to understand our fellow man. The ability to empathize is stripped from us. The religious are prone to this. Reddit is obviously familiar with the late Islamaphobia not only in America but in Europe as well.

All of this said, her reaction of emailing a rebuttal  probably caused bad blood leading to her down-fall. I'm not saying she was wrong, but it's the reality of the educational hierarchy. I can sympathize with emotions running high but, so often, there are consequences for directly opposing authority-- sometimes you have to be more diplomatic than that. But really, does she need to be taking work advice from a 19-year-old like me? She seems to be doing just fine for herself in a new job, for that I'm happy for her.

As for the religious who opposed her, I think they did not read the books they were against and knew nothing about her. I know nothing of the author's religious views, but there may be an indication in the line ""one Sunday after church"". She may be implying she attends (or attended) a church. This does not make one have faith but those with faith are more likely to attend an establishment of religion. Obviously, this would not come out during parent-teacher conferences it is irrelevant-- so because she was not blatant the parents made assumptions ""gay-propaganda!"" ""atheist!"" when in reality she would fight this attacks in her office after Church service on Sundays. Whether she goes to Church or not is pretty-much moot but I mention it to highlight the possibility that the problem likely lies in complete parent ignorance and knee-jerk assumptions.

That's all, I don't expect anyone to read this. It was more . . . therapeutic on my end. Excuse my more paragraph structure.

tl;dr [roughly] Torn between pastor/ preacher and English or History teacher (I'm currently majoring in English and History for Secondary education with a possible minor in youth ministry)-- sickened by this story. I believe literacy is extremely important in every aspect of life and is unacceptable skill not to develop in this modern age. Students should not be emotionally traumatized at a young age but ignoring reality is idiotic. Knee-jerk reaction from parents could be ignoring the teacher's own unspoken views suggesting they rarely really listened to her. The teacher's rebuttal probably shot herself in the foot. But I'm only 19, don't take me too seriously with career advice.

The deal is Anengineeringdegree is right in saying it's more
of an immigration issue.  People are fed up by examples of immigrants getting support from the government while they won't learn the Dutch language or want to find any kind of job. Add the upping of the pension-age with 2 years to this and people feel fed up.
&gt;Would they feel free to take advantage like that if it was Islamic government they were raping? I bet they feel more OK in taking advantage because it's the heretics and unbelievers they are fucking over, which is OK.

  Most Islamic governments don't have any of the Dutch benefits, they are almost all too poor for that.  I am certain you would move to another country too mooch of its system if it was way better than the one you have now. So don't argue it's an Islamic order to mooch of the Dutch government, there are also lots of Eastern-Europeans who do the same and aren't muslim. You would also feel more ok with mooching from some group you don't identify with as much.   Just like the Mexicans feel more ok with taking advantage of the USA government.

Its fairly logical why: doctors all over the world train in the US and want to work in the US. They make vastly more money then they could from their home countries.  Competition is highest, prices are highest.  And that has lead the US to have very top rated facilities.

Here's your evidence:

A McKinsey and Co. report from 2008 found that a plurality of an estimated 60,000 to 85,000 medical tourists were traveling to the United States for the purpose of receiving in-patient medical care;[66] the same McKinsey study estimated that 750,000 American medical tourists traveled from the United States to other countries in 2007 (up from 500,000 in 2006).[67] The availability of advanced medical technology and sophisticated training of physicians are cited as driving motivators for growth in foreigners traveling to the U.S. for medical care,[66]

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_tourism


Most of those patients in search of the best care, including 38% from Latin America, 35% from the Middle East, 16% from Europe and 7% from Canada, are heading to the United States. Additionally, it's estimated that 32% of all medical travelers simply want better care than is available in their home countries, mostly those in the developing world, and 15% want quicker access to medically necessary procedures. That's compared to only 9% of medical travelers seeking medically necessary procedures at lower prices and 4% seeking low-cost discretionary procedures. 

Commonly seeking cutting-edge cardiovascular, neurological or oncology treatments, the bulk of medical travelers head to U.S. medical facilities because physicians from their native countries have trained or currently work there or they follow the lead of friends or family. And then, of course, there's the United States' reputation when it comes to health care.

Of course, the flow of foreigners heading to America's most prestigious academic medical centers, such as Cleveland Clinic, Mayo Clinic or Johns Hopkins is nothing new, says Rick Wade, senior vice president for communication for the American Hospital Association.

I realize that many view this idea as extreme. 

I would argue that even very liberal people during the time of the civil war often thought abolition of slavery was extreme, and even more-so, the idea that you shouldn't buy clothing from southern plantations because they use slave labour must have seemed rather extreme as well.

Most people neglect to think about their economic choices as being, effectively, a vote. With every dollar you give to a company you are voting for their business practices. If you choose a product that is cheap due to foreign slave labour practices, over a more costly but human rights friendly product, you are voting that you care more about price than the victims of said slave-labour. 

For example, are you aware that most computers use minerals mined by Congolese child slave labour? -- http://news.scotsman.com/world/EU-urged-to-pressure-computer.6487118.jpg

If you purchase a computer from said company, you are voting for the practices of said company, but you can also purchase a computer from a company using human rights friendly minerals, and by giving them your dollars you can effectively move the economy in that direction -- thus voting.

That's really the number one problem with the USA -- people think voting is done in a voting booth.

The real democratic process in our country happens at the store, at the bank, at the gas station. Only by voting with our dollars will we be able to really turn this country around.

Of course, and if you were asking more general questions about how religion affects people's lives, your own perspective would obviously be a valid datapoint.  However, since you're asking about *atheists*, the perspective of *any* theist (yourself included) is irrelevant and should not be included in your sample.

&gt; How is, in your view, intolerance and narrow-mindedness taught by religion?

Very effectively ;)

In seriousness, though:  every logically self-consistent ethical system must include ""our way of doing things is morally good,"" either explicitly or implicitly.  In the West, logical self-consistency is highly valued, so this can be considered a broadly applicable principle for Europe and the US.  Therefore any system that includes any notion of moral absolutes must *of necessity* encourage narrow-mindedness and intolerance toward those things which it considers absolutely ""evil""; you can see this in trivial examples like infanticide, but also in more controversial areas like gender equality, homosexuality, abortion, animal rights, and euthanasia.  So the metaphysical stance of moral absolutism (which *almost* every religion adheres to) goes *necessarily* hand-in-hand with intolerance and narrow-mindedness.  Moral relativism on the other hand, which I find is fairly common among the non-religious and the well-educated, does not *necessarily* encourage these things (though of course it does not necessarily prevent them, either).",2,t3_dmckx,True,t1_c11h0wr,0,False,2,1426502087,,,c11h0wr,0,0

I have a diesel one ton dually, 4x4, and I average 18 miles to the gallon.  By the same token, I also have a dodge grand caravan that is only a 6 cylinder, and it only gets about 16 miles to the gallon in town.  So you need to dispel the fuel hog myth.

As far as the european driving mopeds and smart cars, has it ever occurred to you that the particular individuals driving them - maybe that was all they could afford?  Or maybe their roads are to narrow to accommodate anything larger?  But I am pretty certain without ever having been there that not **everyone** in Europe is driving mopeds and smartcars.

I really suspect that you have jealousy issues, and came up with all of these arguments to make your jealousy look less like jealousy and more like being a good green citizen.  In fact, that you have resorted to the name calling of the people who drive trucks makes you look more jealous than anything else.

As far as Peak Oil goes, even though there is a move towards using less fuel in many countries, there are many countries that are pushing to use more oil, like China.  My dad went there in 2004, bought a little electric tricycle for traveling around town, and by 2006, they had outlawed them for anyone that wasn't handicapped (which he was, so he got to keep using it).  But they made everyone move to fuel powered scooters and tricycles, and so now we are in a thing where we can use the fuel, or we can conserve so they can use more fuel.  But for the US to dramatically reduce their fuel consumption isn't going to make fuel available for any longer.  Either everyone on the planet needs to get on board the entire ""use less fuel"" kick - or we are depriving ourselves so someone else can use it.

I really have a sneaking suspicion that you are a single person, or you wouldn't be admiring scooters or smart cars at all.

Oh, I agree, but the thing is that the government keeps secrets from the people, and the only people who make these decisions about what is kept secret are people in the government. State secrets are used to justify keeping people in jail. And so on. 

Meanwhile, the government expects full cooperation from all citizens to provide it with all secrets that they may have. Bank records. Telephone records. Warrantless wiretapping. Sales receipts. Reasons for going overseas upon return. 

Government is not a two way street of accountability for secrets. If the public having the encryption keys for government communications doesn't serve the public interest, then how does the government having the encryption keys for private communications serve the government interest?

Further, the production of stealth bombers and nuclear weapons are devices of the state. Private citizens have absolutely zero use for these things. In the absence of the government funded creation of nuclear weapons there would be no reason for private investment in these ""public goods.""

There is no need for a moderation of transparency. At all. The fact that the government still keeps secrets from WWII is a sign that the government does not want people to know what it has done. It was recently revealed that the Truman administration clandestinely infected dozens of people in Guatemala with syphilis to study the effects of penicillin. About 10 years ago, Robert Stinnett wrote a book that showed how FDR egged the Japanese into attacking Pearl Harbor and disclosed his foreknowledge of an attack in order to get the American people on board with his desire to go to war in Europe. 

The US government conducts absolutely despicable policies, both foreign and domestic, in your name. Think about that. **In your name**, the US government kills people and you have no say in it, and people abroad hold you responsible. There is absolutely no way to know which policies are good and which are bad until all are seen, and the people can sift through the records. 

Just look at the aftermath of the fall of East Germany and the Soviet Union, when people were finally allowed to see what private actions the government was spying on them over. Think about all the abuses of privacy that we know the US government is committing, then think about the fact that we have absolutely no idea how much they are spying on us.

It wasn't the motivation for the trip (and the trip wasn't the motivation for the breakup), it was just coincidental (&amp; a bit convenient) timing.  So a lot of my time was spent sort of learning to be single again, which ended up being really beneficial.

I also met a girl towards the end of the trip who ended up driving with me for 8 days... that turned into a bit of a fling.  She's from Europe and left today, so we both knew nothing would ever come from it.  That didn't make it any less fun, though.  It was like the movie Garden State, minus all the emo bullshit.

Lessons: I learned to live on mostly nothing, and to rely on myself &amp; only myself.  I also learned to be less structured, to take leaps of faith and risks and go with the flow (something I've never had an easy time doing... I overplan &amp; overanalyze).  I also got much better at talking to strangers... when you're on the road, every day is a foreign land, and every person is a stranger.  It's a great opportunity to practice, because if you blow it... who cares?  You'll be 500 miles away the next night.

My advice:  Plan, loosely.  I had a pretty strict itinerary when it came to which days I'd be in which cities - but I had little or no plans when I got to each destination.  That turned out to be the most fun... just arriving in a new place and winging it.  It's a balance, though.  If you're completely without a plan, it wastes a lot of time trying to figure out what direction to head next.  So, pick out some destinations, but don't try to schedule your trip down to the hour, or the day.

I'd also advise to visit places where you know people, or if you don't know anyone, try to find locals to be your tour guide.  Obviously, you'll save on hotels.  But you'll also have a lot more fun if you're hanging out with residents, and not just hopping from tourist-trap to tourist-trap.  Also, sign up for Couch Surfing.

The American system eventually became similar but not until the 14th amendment and that was over 70 years after the french constitution was written and adopted.

You can't argue that the American system of 1787 was similar, because it wasn't. Even at 1792 when the French constitution was written and adopted the American system let the states overrule their constitution and gave the nation almost no legislative power over them. America wasn't a fully fledged, unified nation at that point. It was similar to the EU now, a loose but tightening connection of states that exist almost independently with those that choose to follow the legislation of the union freely able to.

America achieved less, finished after and did it from a position where they were in control of their own country already. The French created achieved much more, finished the job by 1792 and they did it by overthrowing they're centuries old absolute monarchy.

You weren't trying to just say they ended up with something similar you've been trying to argue that the American Independence was of greater or equal value to the French Revolution, and that the first ever democracy in 2000 years was America.

If America wants to curb its terrible per capita emissions, it HAS to tackle the American lifestyle itself. The half hour showers, the AC spam in the summer, the CH spam in the winter. The throwing away 80% of the food you buy etc. 

But, being a democracy, NO government will have the balls to tell Americans to essentially change their tradition of wastefulness. In that aspect, American green movement is screwed. 

THe thing is, heavy industrial pollution CAN be effectively reduced. For example, MOST of the emissions that come out from smokestacks CAN be transformed into cement. But that requires massive amounts of investment so instead of doing it in the U.S., the industries went to China. 

China has actually not learned much from the Americans in terms of green technology, we've been learning from the Europeans in many aspects. Like it or not, they're much, MUCH more progressive and innovative than the U.S. in many aspects.  

The reason why China was able to achieve a 20% per capita reduction in CO2 emissions is because we retrofitted a lot of dirty industries with modern green technology. 

So, while the Americans are busy crushing up old cars by the millions and dumping massive amounts of waste into the environment making new ones, China is aiming to have half the cars on roads be EV cars by 2030, we're concurrently expanding renewable energy generating capacity on every frontier + expanding nuclear power generation. Currently 3 models of domestically produced EVs are already on sale in China while Government Motors in the U.S. try to educate people about why the Chevy Volt isn't a socialist plot.

Even simple things can be done to reduce car pollution MASSIVEly. In China, during Rush hour, lanes in the opposite direction (which are usually empty during Rush Hour) open up to Rush hour traffic to make traffic move much faster. In the U.S. during Rush Hour, you have millions of cars sitting still going one direction while the opposite direction has 5 lanes completely empty.

I disagree, to a point. Average people's taxes actually are higher in Europe, but they get more for what they pay. Transportation is cheap and very fast, unlike the overpriced, slow Amtrak service. A lot of European countries provide ""public option"" housing to keep landlords honest; just think of how much this would save if implemented in New York and Silicon Valley. Healthcare and university are free or very cheap. Also, to be part of the EU, a country has to *mandate* that every company offer 20 days per year of vacation, an allotment that would be 85th percentile or better in the US. 

If you're middle- or upper-middle class, you're probably better off living in Europe, even if your tax rate is higher, especially when you consider intangibles like vacation, pace of work, et cetera.

The only ""cost"" of living in Europe is that it's harder to get very rich, not because of taxes, but because upper-tier jobs don't pay as much. It's very common for a mediocre piece of shit to make $200,000+ per year in the U.S. private sector, not because he's talented, but simply because he's good at office politics. $200k, among corporates and bankers, isn't even worth bragging about. That sort of thing doesn't happen nearly as much in Europe. European salaries also sound low because, when people talk about their pay, they usually quote their after-tax earnings. So an entry-level computer programmer will say that he makes 2500 euros per month... that seems very low for a white-collar professional, until you realize that $42,000 after-tax is about $65,000 pre-tax, which is comparable to US salaries.

The fact of the matter is that the past was horrible and no amount of pining for a time of ""respect and manners"" that never existed is going to make up for the fact that people were *openly* incredibly racist, sexist and bigoted only a few decades ago.

An example: in 1856 (I assume this is far enough back to have ""respect and manners""), Congressman Preston Brooks used his cane to beat Congressman Charles Summer until he was blinded by his own blood and collapsed unconscious *during a senate session.* To suggest that the past was somehow more ""respectful"" a period is incredibly naive. People dueled to the death, beat one another senseless over petty politics, ran massive campaigns of violence over race and religion (yes, even in the US and western Europe) and profited far more than at any other time from graft and corruption in western states.

Individuality as it exists right now stresses a critical analysis of society and its norms and mores. Utilitarian individuality, even more so, is about acting to advance your personal self-interest. This makes it rather unlikely that people are going to care about whatever baseless ideals you have about behavior, and they're going to scoff at you for attempting to force them to act in some particular way just because they offend your narrow sensibilities.

It is pretty standard for those people (cooks/dishwashers) to get tipped out, at about 10% of sales. THEIR job I would not rather do at a place like that so I will give them 3$, but the server ... I'd gladly just do that myself and save myself 5-6$ on top of that.

The Doctor is the service provider.  He charged me for the service, and the charge was $35. 

I concede that I did not lay out all of the details - so I understand why we are having a misunderstanding.  I hope this helps to explain:

I saw a doctor in his office.  There is no secretary, no nurses or additional staff, and no additional support services.  There are no million dollar CAT Scan machines in his simple office... just the basic examination equipment and tools that a general practitioner would need to support his/her practice.  The doctor is the business, and the lone employee of that business.  There is no need for 5 staff to process insurance payments, as the services are directly billed to the clients.  The clients submit payments to National insurance for reimbursement - and it is a single payer system that is not looking to maximize profits.  

Yes, $35 for 45 minutes in this case is an example of getting more value for my money.  I believe that the $35 entitled me to 20 to 30 minutes with the doctor.  If he had another appointment or walk-in, my appointment would not have been as long.    

If more intensive treatment or studies are needed, you would either go to a Hospital or a specialist, who would have more equipment on hand, specialized staff, etc.  There are larger GPs who have receptionists or even nursing staff - but as far as I can tell, the streamlined process allows them to handle more patients per hour, which covers the additional overhead.  

I do not know what the costs associated with specialists or Hospitals are - but from anecdotal evidence I can say that it is certainly much less than is paid in the US.   

All I needed was a consultation with a Doctor to get their expert opinion that I was a healthy person as an input to my immigration process.  In Europe, I got that and a lot more, at a very fair price. 

I do not think that the price was fair in the US system, and I do not believe that I got an appropriate level of service for what I paid for.  ",1,t3_dn0ck,True,t1_c11jn50,0,False,1,1426503327,,,c11jn50,0,0

We starting in Iceland. Icelandair has a stopover system. You tell them your european destination and stop in Iceland for as many days as you want. We flew out of JFK in NY and stayed for 4 nights. It was amazing. We had enough time see Reykjavik as well as do some day trips to see Gulfoss, Geysir, and Blue Lagoon. I would recommend it to anyone and want to go back to see more of Iceland. It wasn't as expensive as you might suspect.

[Norway](http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2052127&amp;id=1433734904&amp;l=bd1f24dbbb)

Norway was where we ended up. We saw Bergen, Voss, Oslo, Flam as well as doing a fjord tour. It was stunning but the most insanely expensive place ever. I want to come back here but need to save many more monies.

[Italy](http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2052528&amp;id=1433734904&amp;l=a203713d8e)

We flew from Oslo to Pisa. Don't spend more than a couple hours in Pisa. They have a tower and that's it. Next we went to Cinque Terre. They have hikes between each to the five coastal towns. This was amazing. After that we went to Florence. There's a ton to see here. Depending on if you wanna go inside the sites you might need at least two full days here.

[Switzerland](http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2056501&amp;id=1433734904&amp;l=6c76184cb7)

Next we went to Interlaken. So beautiful and the people are great. Not insanely crowded and has amazing adventure sports. GO CANYONING! So fun. Also, going up to Jungfrau is awesome. Also, high ropes course was really fun.

[Slovenia](http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2060972&amp;id=1433734904&amp;l=e292b2d157)

This places is a hidden gem. The people are great. The geographic diversity is amazing. The prices are good. First we went to Ljubljana. This is a great capital city. Not too insane and lots of fun history. You have access to caves and beaches. From the beach in Piran you can see both Italy and Croatia. Next we went to Bled. Small fairy tale town with a beautiful lake. Vintgar Gorge is so beautiful. Castles. Second chance for canyoning! Rafting. More caves. Do it!

Started in Budapest, Hungary. People here are really mean to foreigners but there's a lot of nice sights here. The Hungarian bath houses are a fun experience. Terror museum. Opportunity for some down and dirty real cave exploring. 

Next was Krakow, Poland. This is a great city. Very charming. Day trips to Auschwitz and Salt mines. Castle is very nice.

[Czech Republic &amp; Germany](http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2061255&amp;id=1433734904&amp;l=ded73456e4)

We went to Prague. It was too crowded for my taste but the sights are amazing. If you come here definitely take a day trip to Kutna Hora. There's a lot of beautiful sights and this church decorated with the bones of 40,000 people. 

In Germany we only hit Berlin. A lot of it is covered in scaffolding right now. It's a huge city but transportation works great there.

First Amsterdam. I don't smoke so immediately I didn't fit in. It's just madness here. I'm not a fan. Next we went to Delft, which is where I am now. This is a really cute town and you have 10 minutes by train to either Rotterdam or The Hague.

Is this also true for heli pilots? Let's say in the situation where the pilot let's go of the controls without any further inputs.

- When I think helicopter, I think VFR. You said there are IFR certified ones as well. Does that mean the pilot needs to file a fp just like normal pilots? Are the routes the same? What about the speed/height restrictions that are less suitable for helicopters? Why would a heli pilot file IFR anyway?

- I know some of the military ones have autopilot systems, or at least some sort of roll/pitch assistance. Is this also common on the more expensive non-military ones? 

- Are you allowed, with your certification, to also fly in Europe or other places, or just US?

##Are you in favor of the Bologna Process?

Tough questions. I got mixed feelings on the whole Bologna thing. Of course the main ideas of comparability and unburdened change of universities are good, but the realisation of those is quite dubious.

Firstly, the whole Bologna thing led to a massive shift into a more school-like university. Everything must be tested, every bloody useless side-task needs to be documented, and so on. That way of education seems questionable in school, and does so in university even more. The old way university worked was way more open to free working and thinking (and oftenly, also free choices in what subtopics to deepen). Opposing to that, a lot of the new bachelor courses tend to be overloaded with obligatory tasks and exams.

Secondly, it often seems as if comparability is valued more than qualitiy. Which is plain wrong. I'd rather have 20 totally incomparable, high-quality types of university than one super comparable, but mediocre european-wide type of university.

You're talking out of your ass about malpractice insurance. Insurance premiums are high because doctors engage in a lot of malpractice. Your analogy would work if I were paying exorbitant insurance rates because I was involved in a lot of negligent accidents.

t3_dnpvp,1286397064,[deleted],t5_2qh1i,AskReddit,,False,"Might be helpful to more directly identify what kind of program you're looking at.  I'm in the amorphous field of digital humanities, which is interdisciplinary simply because most universities don't have departments/programs devoted to it yet, so I can share some of my experiences.

First, you're going to have to pick a home department.  This will be harder for an interdisciplinary focus than for someone with a traditional field of study. You will have to take classes mostly in your home department, and take a comprehensive exam in a single department (even though my dissertation committee involves 4 departments if you count joint-appointments).  So you're probably going to have to decide between the two departments you mentioned.  There are no ""literary theory"" departments: you're looking at English or Comp Lit.

Second, funding is definitely available if you get into a good university.  The one's you've named are incredibly competitive, but there are other well known and well funded public universities you may want to consider as well.  In the US, anyway, you're probably going to have to teach for a living while taking classes and working on your dissertation.  If you end up in a cognitive/neuroscience department, you'll work in a lab.  Either way, it's going to be a lot of work.  You may get offered a fellowship for your first year, but generally you should expect to work for your tuition waiver and a small (but comfortable if you're frugal or willing to take on roommates) salary.  It's much more common to get a fellowship at the dissertation stage.

My experience: I'm based in English even though I now do very little literary work.  When I applied for my PhD, I sent out applications to different departments at different universities based primarily on the people I wanted to work with and the sort of projects I thought they'd let me get away with.  I ended up in English because the department I chose guaranteed me a salary and a tuition waiver (and health/dental/vision) for 6 years with the possibility of extension if I have trouble finding a job.  Cost of living is cheap where I'm at, so I haven't had a problem paying the bills without the need for roommates.

They also had no problem with me doing a lot of work outside the department and have been extremely supportive at my efforts to do interdisciplinary projects.  I've done cultural studies work typical of English departments, but I've also written some software and studied some open source development histories for my graduate seminars here.  I've been lucky to have professors who encourage innovative scholarship.

I teach two classes a semster, usually on research/writing.  This year I started teaching elective courses on fiction and was able to substitute one of my classes with a job doing webmastering and graphic design on campus.  I plan to join a project team developing text mining software next year after I pass my comps.

As far as ending up living in a car goes, the academic job market is very tight in most fields right now.  I'm not sure whether a European degree would help/hurt getting a job or whether their job market is better than ours.  I'm not too worried because my focus will let me apply for a variety of jobs, and the sort of work I do is one of the few subfields in demand within English departments right now.  If you're considering English as a home department, know that jobs are extremely scarce for people with a lit focus.

I think you misinterpreted the PM as ppm instead of **P**articulate **M**atter. 

&gt;The metric has no tie to fuel efficiency - so despite these types of engines emitting far less pollution per mile traveled than, say, a truck/suv that gets &lt;20 mpg, it doesn't count.

Emissions *are* largely a different metric from fuel economy. Running an engine leaner leads to higher fuel economy but w/ hotter combustion and a matching emissions profile to boot. Europe is concerned w/ CO2 whereas the US (well, CARB more exactly) is concerned w/ the more directly human harmful emissions of PM and NOx. And diesels do emit more of those two types of emissions, hence the PM filters, urea injection, and ammonia NOx adsorber technologies needed to make them compliant to CARB standards.

My beef w/ what emptyvoices said is that he implies that sulfur emissions is a measured factor from which diesel cars are restricted from the US, which isn't true at all. The role that sulfur had in restricting adoption is that it took some time for the US to fully incorporate ULSD vs Europe. ",2,t3_dn8xo,True,t1_c11kbac,0,False,2,1426503640,,,c11kbac,0,0

She tells him, through her actions and words that he's stilting her and not alowing her to go out on her own and make her own decisions?  Has he honestly made it clear she cannot do things with out him?  I think not since he consented the europe vacation, 

She insists that he's uninterested in her diagnosis, but then totally disregards his theories, perhaps he was checked out on that regard because he was told in no uncertain terms that his opinion was not wanted or needed.

Then when tragedy strikes the household, instead of saying it was an accident, as I'm sure he would have said had she been the last to touch the dog, she recriminates him, brings up history and then questions his ability to be a father, that's pretty personal stuff there.  This is because he's unsafe?  I don't know the details but that seems like an ever escalating scale of performance.  Where anything less than perfection is shot down as proof of his unworthiness. 

When he expresses his frustrations with her health, she calls him names and contrary to the proof otherwise says he's uncaring.  Since uncaring people totally do extra house work and try to be involved in the health question, even though he gets rebuffed. 

Then to top it off, he having decided to get married to her, at her coercion, then learns that his love is not enough, and is even the cause of her illnesses and her resentment, his mere proximity is anathema to her.  Wow, loving someone and having them say these things is pretty, no humiliating at all.

So unless there's some details missing, the wife has made a shape in the relationship that she's unhappy with, through no effort of his to put her there, and finding she doesn't like these roles that she so vigorously desired has decided that HE and THE MARRIAGE are the cause of her unhappiness, because she cannot be self determined in the relationship.  Did he do this to her?  Did she do this to herself?  

It certainly isn't humiliating to know that your wife doesn't want to have sex either, not at all.

The person with all the power in this relationship is the woman, and she has contempt for her husband.

t1_c11kn7x,1286410038,TheRedTeam,t5_2qh2p,atheism,,False,"&gt; As an example of something good coming from christianity, liberalism and liberal democracy, idea of human equality (""natural rights"") even idea of separation of state and church finds its origin in early christian philosophy.

I disagree.  These came from Europe during a time when *everything* was christian and people were just starting to cast such dogma aside.  It was right at the time of the rise of protestantism and the end of the inquisitions.  I find them to be the result of people looking for a better system, religion having failed as a ruling body in their eyes. 

&gt; Not to mention, earliest recognition of equal women rights in America was done by Quakers, long before any other enlightened states.

The Quakers are still pretty awesome even today... 

&gt; These institutions enabled a lot of things, which some people call in general ""western civilization'"", including probably fundametalism too as part of it.

I think that religion was the primary organizer in the past and hence it had a hand in most organizations.  Today however, I see that most secular organizations seem to be the most sane and progressive.  

&gt; But unfortunately, arguments here if christians nice guys or bad guys, overshadow curious question ""Does god exist? and if so, should we care?"". Even if christians are bad guys, it doesn't automatically mean that they are totally wrong with theirs view of god and the world, and people should become atheists. In other words, atheism should not be result of christians misbehaviour, but statement of truth. (I would rather prefer to see it that way on reddit)

We do go off on tangents sure, but only because it's a forum and we've got the time.  When people point out bad religious persons it's usually more of a fun/venting than anything else I think. 

&gt; Not exactly so. Considering Marxism, as kind of Scientology, rather than traditional philosophy. It requires more faith from members, than logic and reasoning.

Well, in any case I think that it was just another example of people accepting dogma and authority blindly. ",1,t3_dnlim,True,t1_c11kuvj,0,False,1,1426503898,,,c11kuvj,0,0

With cotton, the textile market boomed, mostly because proccessed cotton was a lot more comfy than wool was (which is mostly what they used). Also potatoes were able to grow really well in the northern countries more, which led to a mass production of it.
