This article makes it sound like a good thing, let me tell you all about this (Hartz IV) is inhuman.

The author is talking about a decent life? Sorry, it could not be further from the truth. The money you do get each month is in reality the very minimum you need to survive. There is absolutely zero margin to for any form of entertainment (no holidays, no restaurant, no cinema, no presents for your kids for birthday or xmas,), just mindless TV.

I realize that for people not from europe it must sound crazy to say anything bad about it, you get free money, you can survive on this without ever doing any kind of work ever in your life.

But it is not, germany has always been a welfare state which made it possible that everyone has healthcare no matter how much you earn (even nothing), the possibility of a home (you dont need to be homeless), food, a basic quality of life, not just to survive.

However, in recent years this changed, this program was introduced (Hartz IV) and people struggle to survive, they get far less benefits, far less money to survive as they did before.

This leads to various problems for feature generations, parents can not afford that their kids reach a higher education, most childs of parents with Hartz IV stop going to school with 16 years so that they can get a job. The kids then struggle to find an apprenticeship, and after that will most likely be jobless too which leads to one thing : the new generation will also receive Hartz IV and their kids too and so on. These people also have mostly on average alot more kids than middle class citizen. This sounds harsh but the effect is that the average german will be less and less educated, the economical effect and quality of life to everyone should be obvious.

Finally think about how people (politicians) are able to judge how much money their citizen actually need, when they earn 20 to 30 times more each month just from their primary job alone (most have a contract with the industry so this easily goes to 100x). They lost reality, they wouldnt even survive 1 week if they would walk in the shoes they put other people in.

The main gist of what I was trying to say and what I am still trying to say is that much of what has happened is not because of Al Qaida's design but because of the US's inept handling of the situation. 

On the point of Saddam, one thing that everyone discounts and dares not mention is that Saddam was a client of the US. This is true in so far as the US facilitated his purchase of the weaponry he used against his citizens, including the chemical weapons. It is highly hypocritical to say that because of who he was the US should have intervened. In actuality the US is the main sponsor of some of the major despots in the Middle East, from Mubarak in Egypt (where torture is common place) to zero freedom Saudia. So the US has zero high ground to stand on. It all comes down to oil and oil.

As to the torture and the like, it is not the fact they were done by individuals, it is the fact the system was/is no longer capable of addressing these acts honestly and in a just way. All that Obama's administration has done is go out of its way to cover up Bush's misdeeds, Gauntanamo is still operational. These are not the actions of a mature democracy. It is something we would expect from a newly minted East European democracy.

On the idea of Muslims, it is not about the those that have trusted the US, it is however the fact the majority of Muslims do not trust the US (blanket statement .. but I think true). It is incomprehensible to view positively a nation that sponsors the despot that makes your life hell. If Muslims were a monolithic body then we can say this or that, however just because a great majority of the elite in nations with zero democracy that suckle on the tit of the US, trust it, does not mean that the US has any great support.

On Iran, the fact that the US has transformed itself into a polar opposite and is unable to establish diplomatic relations is not Al Qaida's doing. Iran is an enemy as far as Al Qaida is concerned (did you know that Osama's immediately family is currently being held in Tehran and have been for the last few years?). However the fact the US has been unable and unwilling to co-opt Iran has meant that another front could not be opened on Al Qaida.

Chile has been unusually independent and homogeneous since it was started as a colony in the 1500s when geographic barriers were even more formidable.  It is a long strip of land with the largest population centers near to the middle.  One of the sure signs of cultural separation is the unique local accent.  Chile's largest trading partners are in Europe, North America, and Asia, not South or Latin America.

&gt;Apostasy laws? Laws forcing women to cover their hair?

Yes and yes.  I don't like Sharia punishments such as limb amputations and caning, and I can't say I am a huge fan of ""an eye for an eye"" either, which Islam seems to borrow/inherit from the Bible.

&gt;Left to its own devices, Islam would have likely taken the course you would have wanted.

Don't you dare blame any of this shit on outsiders.  Muslims have responsibility to keep Islam decent and free of barbarity.  Islam doesn't exist in a fucking void.  Muslims are our neighbors, for better or for worse.  This means of course Muslims will hear some opinions about their religion, including many negative ones.  A lot of the criticism Islam receives is well deserved.  Well deserved.  Don't be blaming it now.

What the Bushies were doing, plus what the Obama is continuing, that's a separate issue.  That's the issue of corporatism and greed, which by the way I am strongly opposed to.  If Muslims were more rational and reasonable people, I would personally ally myself with them because both me and Muslims denounce things like greed and usury.  So we have a lot of common ground.  But I can't ally myself with a runaway doctrine and that's exactly what Islam is.  Islam has so many poisoned doctrinal writings, in both Qur'an, ahadith and the commentaries, that seriously there is no easy way to completely disinfect Islam.  Reformation would be nice and would go a long way toward that.  Then maybe we could unite and struggle together against the greedy bastards who are manipulating shit, including religions of the world, left and right, to get their goals.

By the way, Clinton and Europe stuck up for the Kosovo Muslims.  Of course they did that because they hated the commies and not because they are so morally upright or anything.  USA ""helped"" mujahadeen for the same reason, because they hated the Soviet Union and commies and not for any righteous reason.  All these alliances were based on mutual hatred and not on brotherly love.

Don't confuse two different issues.

Issue 1: Elites are trying to control wealth and trying to dominate politics.  These elites have become worldwide and are not tied to any specific country.  They originate largely from USA, but I don't think they give a shit about USA.  If USA is to collapse tomorrow, they'll just laugh and move to Singapore.  In fact a few of them already moved there.  These guys are mobile and the only one they care about is their own self.

Issue 2: Abrahamic religions have always been harmful to society, but now it's becoming not just obvious, but *painfully* obvious.  There is a struggle going on between secular people and Christian and Islamic ones.  Christians like to oppose Muslims and Christians have a lot of inter-sectarian strife.  Muslims of course love to oppose other Muslims and if they think you differ on one or two doctrinal points, they'll be happy to declare you an apostate and bomb the fuck out of you.  What you don't realize, is that the rest of the world is tired of all this shit and wants all of you to either calm the fuck down, or get the fuck out, whichever is easier.  2.2 + 1.6 = 3.8 billion crazies, and we are fucking tired of you.

People can tolerate religion, but not the crazy that very often comes with it.  What you don't want to admit (and Christians don't want to admit this too), is that while most of you are not overtly crazy, you know damn well you sympathize with the crazies.  A lot of moderate Muslims say shit that makes my ears curl.  I read a book like ""Islam for Dummies"" and I read things like ""Islam is ideologically opposed to secular government."" right in the book that's aimed at the broadest possible audience and published in USA by Muslims.  You'd think they would do a better job of appearing more modern and moderate, but nope.  Oh yea, they do say *some* scholars in the Islamic world are just now beginning to wonder if the separation of religion and State is perhaps not a bad idea after all.

Then, one day I was served some eggplant parmigiana and tucked in before I'd really even thought about it. Been eating well cooked eggplants with gusto ever since. 

I've had similar experiences with peanuts and raw bell peppers, and to a much lesser extent with raw tomatoes, with the difference being that I won't even consider eating peanuts. That experience was just too horrible. I really thought I might choke to death last time I had a handful of those. What typically happens with me is I get a ""tickle"" in the back of my throat, and it can either be just a tickle, or can lead to uncontrollable coughing jags that may or may not lead to actual puking. When I do upchuck, I'm convinced it's not a stomach rejection kind of thing so much as just my body trying to clear the perceived throat irritation. 

Aside from the dreaded peanut, the plants that seem to give me the most potential for problems are all nightshades. Now, where this gets interesting is that northern Europeans once regarded nightshades as poisons. Could it be that someone with Scandinavian ancestry just isn't always evolved to eat nightshades? That's one possibility. But, yet, eating most of these nightshades cooked well doesn't seem to bother me. 

I discussed this at length with an allergist I'd seen for years. I told him that when I picked the nightshade family from the garden, usually in the morning, or evening that I often felt the twinges of the throat tickle that presage the awful throat tightening that can lead to the godawful coughing and choking. He theorized that it's actually molds on the nightshades and peanuts that I'm allergic to. This makes sense. I'm extremely allergic to molds. My body would not likely take eating them kindly. I get the same reaction to a lesser degree from Blue Cheese, (though I love it). He says it's always the foods you like the most.

After all, it's my home there, I'm as British as you get - I'm great at complaining, I will happily sit and watch a five day test match, I love crumpets. I had a good job, working with great people. I wasn't utterly unhappy with my life, I just felt that I'd be happier elsewhere.

Although most of my friends from my hometown are English, throughout my life (especially at university) I've found that I gravitate towards foreign people. I love learning about other cultures and languages, and travelling around Europe just amplified that passion. At university my girlfriend was an English born Chinese girl, a lot of my friends were exchange students (my best friends were Singaporean, Barbadian, Japanese, Indian and Saudi Arabian). I was quite active in the Anime society at uni, even though I only followed a couple of series - it was mostly to meet people and practice my Japanese while drunk (Japanese people make terrible drinkers but fabulous drunks, FYI).

At the place I worked until I went freelance, they hired a lot of foreign interns to keep costs low - I was one of only two English people there, surrounded by young foreign girls. Again, I loved it, as I got to learn about people from all over Europe and further afield, their views on English life, etc. Even though they were 5 years younger than me they seemed much more worldly and comfortable within themselves, and just being around them made me start to believe that perhaps life in England wasn't necessarily for me. They also highlighted a lot of things about England that I didn't like (chavs, binge drinking, ridiculous cost of living, etc.), which caused me to think more about whether it's the same everywhere (pro tip: it isn't).

I've only ever had one fully English girlfriend and looking back at it, she was so boring. That's not to say that all English women are boring, just my own experience of being with one. I have English female friends who are lovely, but I'd never date them or girls like them.

I guess I've always been one of these people who likes to be 'different' - when my friends started going out clubbing in our teens I was smoking weed with friends and jamming. When everyone went to uni to study either politics or economics or business studies, I chose to do classics. Not in a 'too cool for school' hipster way, I just had no interest in the things that seemed to float everybody else's boats. Maybe that's why I gravitated towards things that weren't usual at the time, and still do now.

Either way, I felt like I needed a big change in my life, and just thinking about it made me feel excited for all the new experiences that were waiting for me out here. My mouse cursor hovered over the purchase button when booking my ticket for about 15-20 minutes... But I'm glad I clicked :)

I definitely didn't come here because I wanted people to consider me exotic. If I'd wanted to do that I wouldn't have chosen China, and I probably wouldn't have moved in with my girlfriend as soon as I got here :P

But don't let that fool you... if you're a westerner and you come here, you will do pretty well with the ladies. Seriously, you'll barely need to try.

I love the sound of the five cylinder and the turbo.  It's only a 5 speed (Europe got a 6 speed) but I have no complaints about the gear spacing, though a taller top gear for highway cruising would be nice.

You're right about the age, and that's a problem in several ways.  Mine is chipped (280hp) and has a bunch of other upgrades (993TT front brakes and rotors with custom hats, silicone hoses, and more), but modern cars have gotten so good that it is hard to compete.  The front end is HEAVY, too; my 2001 S8 only weighs 100 pounds more despite its bigger size and V8 engine yet seems to handle so much better.

Also, having almost 15 years on it (mine is a 1995.5, the last model imported to the US) and close to 200,000 miles means that things just keep breaking.  So far this year I've replaced the ignition switch, oil pressure sender, the parking brake lines, and an ignition coil, and I'm bound to have more things fail as time passes.

On the other hand, I still get compliments about it, and people are astonished to hear how old it is and how many miles it has.  It's a great car and very practical.  This year alone, on different occasions I have hauled 25 folding chairs, a three-drawer 36"" lateral filing cabinet, and 100 thermal printers, and at other times it's swallowed things like a 150-pound laser printer and a table with four chairs.

They wanted the land that they had been living on for over a thousand years.

There were some legitimate concerns:

&gt; John Wolffe says that while Zionists have attributed Palestinian rejection of the plan to intransigence, others have argued that it was rejected because it was unfair: it gave the majority of the land (56 percent) to the Jews, who at that stage legally owned only 7 percent of it, and remained a minority of the population.[87] Mehran Kamrava also notes the disproportionate allocation under the plan, and adds that the area under Jewish control *contained 45 percent of the Palestinian population.* The proposed Arab state was only given 45 percent of the land, much of which was unfit for agriculture. Jaffa, though geographically separated, was to be part of the Arab state.[87] Eugene Bovis says that the Jewish leadership had rejected an earlier partition proposal because they felt it didn't allocate enough territory to the proposed Jewish state.[88]

If you read the above article, 99% of the Palestinian part of the partition was in fact Arab/Palestinian.
But 45% of the Jewish part was Palestinian, however.  This is a recipe for disaster. The  Jews didn't want the Arabs, and the Arabs didn't want to be ruled by Jews.     And with the faster birth growth, the Jewish part would be swamped by Palestinians in no time without immigration.   I find it hard to believe that the expulsion of the Palestinians was a *defensive* move, rather than one made out of demographic necessity.

sorry but that's not true.

The poster is confused, food in Western Europe especially is insanely expensive and not of the greatest quality. America has some of the BEST quality food in the world.

The food overseas is different, but its rarely something you can't find in America in some ethnic store or even mainstream grocery stores (like Wegmans.) 

The food culture in the US is what the problem is. Immigrants who are just as poor as Americans will eat fresh meat, and vegetables in the dishes of their culture they make from scratch. The Americans will eat frozen fried chicken and TV dinners in lieu of food from scratch. Personally, I actually find that processed food is WAY more expensive than ingredients for basic meals.

But its entirely plausible that our economy could advance in efficiency, producing improvements to material well being that requires less consumption of resources.

This was interesting to me:

&gt;Between 1990 and 2001, for every $100 worth of growth in the world’s income per person, just $0.60, down from $2.20 the previous decade, found its target and contributed to reducing poverty below the $1-a-day line.38 A single dollar of poverty reduction took $166 of additional global production and consumption, with all its associated environmental impacts. It created the paradox that ever smaller amounts of poverty reduction amongst the poorest people of the world required ever larger amounts of conspicuous consumption by the rich.

The other thing that interested me was pg 23 which has an interesting chart based on a survey of 35,000 people in Europe (I really F-ing wish google docs would let me link to specific pages). It shows that the subjective sense of life satisfaction tops out at a relatively low level of material consumption. And even when we scale the level of consumption upwards, it doesn't increase the reported sense of satisfaction. (that's not to say it can't increase, but that we should look for a way to increase it that doesn't depend on material consumption.)

In many ways it seems to me that early Islam comes accross as superior to modern Christianity. Especially in the common respect for science and philosophy.
Unfortunately most people are too caught up in the 'mine is better' version of their own religion to consider the positive aspects of others.

I'm still processing chapter 6. There is a lot to absorb there. If I can find the time I'm going to go back and read it again.

Truth is, more people I know went to work because their bosses told them that if they didn't show up to work on the day of the strike, they shouldn't bother coming back the next day. Workers in a shop right below my place were saying thank god for the pickets because of this very thing. If you don't go to work you might lose your job, but if someone else prevents you from going, you get the same effect, but your boss can't blame you.

Can't speak for the rest of the country, but at least in my home town (around 500.000 people), 90% of factories, companies, shops, banks, bars and restaurants closed for most of the day. There were very few taxis or buses available for most of the day, and everybody just stayed at home.

My thoughts? War has been declared on the workers. Not even the leftist media supported the strike. Everybody's been bought out.",t1_c1111dz,1285943077,jandemor,t5_2cneq

Hamas is an elected government entity. Can you point me to Hamas.mil? 

&gt;In 1993 PLO recognized Israel's right to exist in peace, accepted UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, and rejected ""violence and terrorism""; in response Israel officially recognized the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people.[4]

This is not a terrorist organization.

&gt;If 10 poorly armed Palestinians come at one well-armed Israeli soldier, you can more Palestinians than Israelis to die.

If 10 civilians come at 1 heavily armed soldier, I can expect that soldier to kill all ten if he is Israeli and they are Palestinian. Is this what you are saying?

&gt;I mean, if you're armed with a gun and I come at you with a knife, nobody expects you not to use your gun to protect yourself.

I do. What about the attacks on the freedom flotilla? They were practically executed. There was not a single gun. If you want to maintain some kind of formal peace, asymmetrical use of force should be kept to a minimum.

&gt;Hamas also has money. They tax the tunnels and they get ""donations"" from friendly countries. However, they don't invest in their lives.

They can't even leave or re-enter their nation freely. EU fuel supplied to them is consistently denied. Do not act like they have the freedom to prosper that you are suggesting.

&gt;They invest in Israeli deaths.

Inflammatory. Citation please.

&gt;Not true. Ever heard of Indian reservations?

Ever heard of the conditions on these reservations? Not good. The fact of the matter is, there was a genocide of the Indian people in America. 

&gt;Israel was a kingdom for about 500 years before the Babylonians conquered it. It was also a kingdom for about 150 years or so 2000 years ago. Where did you get your figure of 78 years?

You were trying to paint Jews as the native-Americans of Palestine. You white washed the fact that the Arabs have been the vast majority for 1300 years. I read it somewhere, 78 and 150.. 2000 years ago are not so different.

&gt;And if they decided to buy land all over the US and live alongside white people,

They have no money, their land and resources were plundered.. 

&gt;would you justify white people who became suicide bombers against the Native Americans?

You are trying to suggest that all the land Israel now occupies was obtained rightfully? There are constant illegal land grabs *still*.

First off, it sucks. The whole derailment of plans is so very frustrating. I hope that I am out of debt now, wait...I am in year three, you are still in year two; something is amiss. 

Gah, does this ever confuse me. First, I would like to say that you may have gotten out of this easy. For one thing, you are not the bad guy. To me that was/is very important. Mostly because I do truly love and cherish my relationships with her family. And you dont have a bunch of drama being spread about you in the female friend world. Which is going to be helpful later on. 

I say, we say; fuck it. Sell everything, and backpack Europe like we wanted to do in our youth. The jobs, houses, kids, all of that will be here when we get back. Remember, its about the experiences through life that makes it worth it. 

The best thing we ever did was to quit being that lazy douche. So grateful we quit smoking. Running is the true savior. No we havent ran the marathon yet, but, the women that run...oh my. I am actually in great shape. I do believe that if I needed to run from the police, I have a fairly good chance at getting away. Keep in mind that the reason we hit the gym is not just for all the hotties we can get, but so that we may actually have the ability to live as long as we can with the people we truly fall in love with. We want to live long enough to play with our grandchildren, see as many innovations to our Earth as we can, and to look into the eyes of Her, whom we have struggled to find our entire lives, forever. 

Please know that this is only temporary. We have much more hurt and heartache to go through later on. This pain is only preparing us for what we have to go through later on. Remember, if we aren't getting stronger, we are getting weaker. 

Sure, we can find solace in spirits. I prefer Beam and Coke for the  immediate, but nothing beats sitting outside, a cooler of beer, your best mate and some tunes. Dont listen to sad shit. Not until later, much later in the evening. I prefer we listen to some metal. Maiden, Crue, Chevelle, as that can induce some 'shot' sessions. Something like that early in the evening. Perhaps slowly work our way into some Apparat, or Little Boots, or Florence and The Machine midway through. We surely will be ending the night with some Ryan Bingham and Jamey Johnson. 

Dont go though the house, finding things that bring the ""Oh Remember's"" while we are drinking. That leads to phone calls and letter writing, emails that dont need to be sent and facebook stalking that could fuck us up later on. Please, please remember that we got out of this only slightly fucked up. It could have been a whole lot worse. We are now a person that is different. We are not the same as when we got married. That part of our brain is fucked. Forget about it. It will go away on its own. We are only to do simple shit right now until it does. Its like being on ""light duty"". Gym Tanning Laundry is now a rehabilitating therapy. Gets us back into the swing of things.

The only difference between communism and social democracy is the degree to which the government abolishes private property in various economic sectors, and the degree to which they control the means of production.

Food, Shelter and healthcare.  I do not want people to suffer.
But I do not want to fund their lifestyles beyond the basics.
Most conservatives feel this way regardless of how many times Kieth Olbermann says conservatives kick puppies for fun.


Conservatives get a bad rap here. We definately neds to drop the religious bullshit but in general we are for responsible government, not throwing money at a wall and hoping it sticks.


The American way is to earn your own, not a ""cradle to the grave"" syndrome. We (generally) are VASTLY different in mindset, you may think we are screwed up, but we are fundementally different, more optimistic, more driven and more ""can -do"" than anyone else.

Our education isn't as bad as they want you to think. As far as University costing money, you can get a free education in the US, please, again, do some research.  I am sure all the European kids coming over here to spend their money on our ""university"" educations are all so pissed about it.

Right.  Keep thinking that.

One thing that is never ever mentioned, is the ethnic problem.
I am not saying ethinicity in itself is a problem but the diverse nature of the US is an issue many or most European countries do not have to deal with.  The huge burden of supporting a community that does nothing to better itself and instead relies on government and a rapidly waning sympathy for past injustice is simply massive.

I am talking of course, about the african american population.
They have been oppressed, in slavery, and treated poorly for hundreds of years and it is only in the last 30 or so that things have changed, they are not able to pull themselves out of the past for many reasons (I am not blaming them) including vicious cycles of a lack of parenting.

It might be a helpful tool to use if you do confront her. The religious confuse ""knowledge"" with something they really, really want to be true. Belief, of course.

When I was a kid, I really, really wanted to be able to fly. I wanted it to be true *so badly*. This is pretty much how I think religious folks who have ""religious"" experiences come to interpret them as truly religious.

Look at one of those cottage-cheese suburban ceilings for ten minutes or so. You'll begin to see faces. This is from an article on the NYT site:

---------------------------------
More than a decade ago, Diana Duyser of Hollywood, Florida, received a religious message through an unlikely medium — a grilled cheese sandwich she had made herself. As she gazed at the brown skillet marks on the surface of the bread, a familiar visage snapped into focus.

""I saw a face looking up at me; it was the Virgin Mary staring back,"" she told reporters in 2004. ""I was in total shock.""

After holding on to the stale relic for 10 years, Duyser put it up for sale on eBay. The auction generated so much excitement that the sandwich eventually sold for $28,000, proving that she was not alone in seeing a face where none should reasonably exist. Such faces made headlines again near the end of 2006, when Mars Express, an orbiter from the European Space Agency, captured the highest-quality three- dimensional images to date of what looks like a face in the Cydonia region of Mars. The photos reignited conspiracy theories that governments on Earth are trying to hide the existence of intelligent life on Mars.

Why do we see faces everywhere we look: in the moon, in Rorschach inkblots, in the interference patterns on the surface of oil spills? Why are some potato chips the spitting image of Fidel Castro, and why was a cinnamon bun with a striking likeness to Mother Teresa kept for years under glass in a coffee shop in Nashville, Tennessee, where it was nicknamed the Nun Bun?

Compelling answers are beginning to emerge from biologists and computer scientists who are gaining new insights into how the brain recognizes and processes facial data.

Long before she had heard of Duyser's grilled cheese sandwich, Doris Tsao, a neuroscientist at the University of Bremen in Germany, had an inkling that people might process faces differently from other objects. Her suspicion was that a particular area of the brain gives faces priority.

""Some patients have strokes and are then able to recognize everything perfectly well except for faces,"" Tsao said. ""So we started questioning whether there really might be an area in the brain that is dedicated to face recognition.""

Tsao used functional magnetic resonance imaging to record which areas of the brain were activated when macaque monkeys were presented with stimuli including fruits, gadgets, scrambled patterns — and faces. She discovered almost immediately that groups of cells in three regions of the brain's temporal lobe seemed to be strongly attuned to faces.

Her results were published in October in the journal Science.

Tsao's investigation yielded a surprising related finding: areas of the brain she had identified as face-specific occasionally lit up in response to objects that bore only a passing resemblance to faces.

""Nonface objects may have certain features that are weakly triggering these face cells,"" she said. ""If you go above a certain threshold, the monkeys might think that they're seeing a face."" In the same way, she said, objects like cinnamon buns, rocky outcroppings and cloud formations may set off face radar if they bear enough resemblance to actual faces.

Our naughty, naughty brains. Our facility for imagining is so incredibly strong, the brain thinks it's really seeing the things it wants to see. Fact of the matter of is we don't know shit- we only believe things.

I had a Ouija board that wouldn't go away.

When I first got it, it was kind of fun to screw around with.  Fast forward a few months, having it over for parties etc. and there were some pretty weird nights.

Decide after a few extra weird nights to just be rid of it.

Give it to a friend who's going to school in Alabama that I know I'll never talk to again.

A month later at a random house party I would normally skip, I run into her and she happened to bring the Ouija board with her.

It some how finds its way into the trunk of my car that night, and I end up taking it home.

3 months later I give it to someone else, this time someone on the west coast.  6 months later she's back in town, and the board ends up at my place somehow.  I have nothing to do with it.

Finally meet some exchange students from Austria.  I convince them to take it with them as a funny American remembrance.    This was my senior year of college at this point.

I graduate, they go back to Europe and take the board with them.  All is well and I know I'll never see it again.

The next year I go to Madison for their state street Halloween party.  Drop in on some friends who are still in school.  Start walking in the back door and I see the two exchange students from Austria.  They're back.  And at this one particular party.

I made everyone with me leave and we went to the other side of town again.  (they knew about the board and wanted to see if they'd brought it with them.)  I suppose it's not as unlikely as I think it is, but I didn't want to get it back again.

Googling to find the background to the dispute I found this

&gt; In 1984 the British government was taken to the European Court and had to amend the Equal pay Act to provide equal pay for work of equal value.

If you fancy the higher pay of those doing different work you should apply for the next job opening that comes along and get the higher pay that comes from the different work. If you are not allowed to, because you are the wrong sex, the government should step in to prevent sexual segregation. And the government should be vigilant to make sure that things aren't being rigged behind the scenes, with women being allowed to apply, but never getting the job.

But I'm appalled at the notion of having a tribunal decide that different kinds of work are of ""equal value"". In any sane world there are both men and women doing both kinds of work. Every-one has their individual preference for one kind of work over another and what wage premium would persuade them to switch.

Eventually we got talking, and she asked me what my girlfriend's name was. I told her, it is an obviously Russian name, she (being interested in all things eastern European) was intrigued and asked me what her last name was, I told her. Both she and my grandfather started laughing... hard.

I asked them what was up. Apparently they knew her. Well...

As a European, I'm going to stick my neck out and say this: The ban on Burkhas has NOTHING to do with the oppression of women. That's just the excuse.

As some of you may have noticed, times arent so great in Europe at the moment. 

This is not the fault of Muslims, but alot of people feel that an outside agenda has been pushed on them in the form of 'political correctness' but also from fiascos like those Danish Cartoons. Therefore, support for extreme right-wing groups has grown, especially now that money is short.

It's this political aspect that is the real reason for the ban. In France, the current government is relying on support from the (fascist) French National Front, and in the Netherlands, Geert Wilders' (anti-islamic) Freedom Party currently stands as the 'kingmaker' faction.

Previously, parties like these have been dismissed  (a foolish tactic that has led to widespread distrust for politicians in Europe, since our elected officials evidently only listened to opinions they liked to hear) but now they are forced to listen to and obey the European extremists.

So, we see the Burkha banned in France and the Netherlands, Minarets banned in Switzerland and immigration halted in Sweden.

Islam is the victim of it, because many Europeans feel that they have become the victims of Islam – the death threats to Danish newspapers, the attacks on Madrid and London, the push for Sharia Law.

So the scientists from Project Paperclip *weren't* ""immigrants"". They were hostages.

There was a great race on after Germany fell, with the U.S. and the Soviet Union vying to see how many scientists they could kidnap and put to work on their various initiatives.

But never mind.

Let's pretend that they were all ""immigrants"" and ""we're a nation of immigrants,"" therefore we should get the credit.

Okay.

You point out a large problem yourself by saying that most university research happens as a result of three things: 1) University funding, 2) Government funding or 3) Corporate funding.

We both know that the second two are the most realistic sources of revenue. Universities are always scrounging for funds, and never have millions just lying around to give to their science departments for ""pure research"". So, in the real world, universities are usually the beneficiaries of funding from the military industrial complex, or from corporations like Revlon or Johnson &amp; Johnson.

Because these sources of revenue *want* something in return for their money, the research they ask to be done isn't usually scattershot and exploratory. They're not in it for ""pure science"". They're in it to 1) Either build new weapons or defense systems, or 2) to conduct some study that proves that cigarette smoking isn't really *that* bad for you.

That's why most countries look at our ""studies"" and scoff. In their own socialist countries, the universities get tax revenue which helps to actually fund their science departments. They're not as reliant on shady secondary sources, like the universities in America.

It's one case where it can be argued that Capitalism might be said to hamper science, and where socialism [at least, Western European-style liberal socialism] actually fosters ""pure scientific research"".

It all boils down to: You get what you pay for. And they're willing to subsidize universities, whereas in the U.S. we're like, ""You want money? Beg for it. See how many con-men and corporations you can scrounge from"". And whoever has the money gets to call the tune that the piper plays.

As an American, I'm bitter as hell that we don't have the technological edge we used to have . . . that our scientists aren't as free to let their imaginations wander, because they're being sidetracked with bullshit studies from the Corn Manufacturers of America, who want them to cobble together a report where it says that ""corn syrup is good for children"". Meanwhile, the lazy-ass Europeans are making discoveries left and right because they're free to dick around. And 9 times out of 10, discoveries don't happen because we plan them but because we stumbled onto them.

Thus the half-assed European scientists, free to sleep with their students and conduct studies on whatever the hell they want, are coming up with these amazing advances. While our scientists are busy proving that Coca-Cola is as effective at cleaning teeth as brushing them, and that children needn't brush anymore, so long as they swish with Coke every night before going to bed. It might not be true, but it'll soon be in a commercial (so they'll need the junk science study to stave off lawsuits).",t1_c112tsi,1285950380,Drooperdoo,t5_6

&gt;Where you and I disagree most is that I see the hand of millennia of gender inequality and women's oppression in the way women are not paid for the work they do.

I'd agree that this is likely the point we are divided upon.  I don't see this occurring, and when it does I think it has more causes than simply just oppression.  I don't know anybody under 70 that thinks any less of women.  In fact I think in most social situations women now have the upper hand of chivalry and equal rights.  

However I'm willing to assume this this is anecdotal, but the studies I see state there is a gap, but it doesn't adequately explain why the gap is there.  Whether it's because most women don't ask for raises, or threaten their jobs like men do (possibly due to gender roles) or whether it's due to an overall trend that they miss more days than men, and thus over a long career earn less due to smaller raises or what-have-you.

&gt;I think centuries of women's oppression have programmed us to think of the work that women do as .... well, not that important.

I don't think that, nor do I see evidence that this occurs.  Perhaps it's   cultural difference.  Much like racism doesn't really occur where I live, but it does in the US.

&gt;So women still do 2/3ds of all domestic labour, more than three quarters of all unpaid caring for sick people, and 80% of all childcare (not just giving birth!)

Overall this might be true.  I can only speak from my own experience but my wife tends to choose to do domestic things around the house and wants to take care of the baby (diapers and everything) as she feels that it's her job, and she's evolved that way to do it better.  She takes pride in the fact that she's a woman and can likely do these tasks better than me (although I don't see any particular advantage myself) In exchange I do things she doesn't want to do, such as home maintenance, finances, and other things.  

Is it a gender role?  Perhaps, but she chooses to live it for her own reasons and to be honest I'd love (and have) swapped and prefer doing the domestic chores than finances and stuff as it's less stressful.  But again this is anecdotal, but if women have a maternal instinct of any kind, this will lead to a significant slant in studies.  Just because it occurs doesn't mean it's by force or oppression.  Not all women want to be construction workers, and not all men want to be white collar business men.

We evolved to do things, so it's possible we have a subconcious pull to perform certain roles.  Is this social programming?  Maybe.  It could also be biology.  In either case, I think we can agree that as long as people have the option to do what they want, then it doesn't matter what they choose to do.

So long story short, women may in fact do more domestic work, but perhaps that's what they WANT to do.  Whether we like it or not, men and women have differences in thinking, men being better at spatial awareness etc, and women being better at verbal and language tasks.  This might lead to different comfort zones and tasks.

&gt;I can easily imagine an analogous situation where men's work is assumed to be unworthy of compensation. Imagine a society that considered protection to be a sacred calling, and 99% of men felt pressured to ""choose"" to be on their neighbourhood cop squad in their free time, and it was simply expected that men in their twenties will donate their time to become soldiers for three or four years, taking a break from their careers to do it.

Well this is done in a lot of countries that have mandatory military service for men, and it's optional for women.  Norway and Sweden for instance.

&gt;This work would be called ""being a husband"", and it would be somewhat looked down upon since taking time off to work your muscles and giving your brain a rest would be thought to make men dumber, less capable of re-entering the workforce. There would be men's movements to get wives to do equal time, but men would still end up doing the vast majority of it, and women would justify it by citing evolution.

Well for the sake of the argument I assume we're making this military career have skills completely non-transferable to a workplace situation (for the most part anyway).  

I can sort of see your point.  Women choose (whether through evolution or social conditioning) to raise the children until they're of school age so they can be shipped off to public school.  I don't think there is really a way to prevent penalties for such a thing though.  It would be out-right unfair for someone who takes 5 years off to come back and earn the same as someone who did not take 5 years off.

I'd be in favor of social education of teaching children that it's cool for the men to stay home too though.  For instance I'm likely going to be the one to homeschool my kids, do domestic chores and be a ""house husband"" although I hate the adjective for men or women.  I realize I'm likely an exception to the rule, however.

So like I said, I'm in favor of education and maybe trying to steer the social stigma away, which I think has changed quite a bit in the last few decades.  I'd be against anything state sanctioned to force employers to pay someone who takes years off their career the same as someone who doesn't though.

&gt;You see what I'm saying?

I hope so.

&gt;It's all a matter of societal conventions. It's all about how we choose to look at things through the lens of cultural norms. There is nothing inherently less work-like about having and raising kids, than being a cop or a soldier.

The only difference is one is for the greater of society, the other is a large part personal gain.  People fill full-filled to have children, to pass on their genetics, to live forever through their genes.  My parents will rest easier in their retirement years because of their kids for instance.

&gt;Given the right social programming, cops and soldiers would derive the same satisfaction and meaning from their work as parents do.

I sort of disagree here.  Having children is a much more selfish thing, especially since overpopulation is such a problem.  Laying your life down to protect other's rights (America being sort of an exception here) is much more altruistic.

&gt;The only justification we have to make life so hard for moms (they are essentially shut out from ever being as financially stable as nonmoms of either gender) is that people are showing no signs of slowing down their childbearing.

Well the justification is that anyone (regardless of reason) who takes time out of their career to do something that is not career-related will suffer monetarily.  Whether it's a backpacking trip across Europe for a few years, or taking up drugs and being homeless.

If children were more rare in society, and we had to push for more children, then yes, there would be more incentive to have kids.  But this isn't the case, so there isn't additional incentives to have kids.  People have kids for themselves,s not for society.

&gt;shrug I guess that makes sense if you're a capitalist. Supply and demand.

Well the problem is the resources on the planet are finite.  Capitalist or not, we're having too many kids.  Even under socialism we'd have to heavily discourage having children, limited resources (money in this case) is just one and probably the best way to do this.

&gt;I'm just really concerned that it's so unfair. I think a workable solution to my problem here would be longish paid maternity and paternity leave, funded by taxpayers, and huge feminist campaigns to get men to shoulder an equal burden in childrearing even if biology limits them from childbearing.

I'd be in favor of greater education.  This will likely get rid of a lot of bias much like how racism has gone the way of the dodo (and will continue to as the older generations die off).  I'm in favor of paternal leave, even tax funded (if statistically it balances out at least).

The problem I see is that women choosing childrearing has more to do with our natural impulses and desires than social stigma.  So I think there will always be a rather large slant.  Unless you plan to force by threat of incarceration, I don't see this becoming perfectly equal.

So overall I think we have very similar goals.",t1_c112hk6,1285950798,Inferno,t5_2qyt6

This might not work for your friend's friend, but who knows. Sometimes all someone needs is a little push and some reassurance that there are people there to provide help and support.


My fiance isolated me from my friends and family to such a degree that I was hardly able to speak with them. My mom had given up hope that she would ever really get a chance to spend time with me, and I wasn't even able to talk to my dad on his birthday. I was miserable, and so were they. My sister's friend saw this and said, ""we have to save her!"" So one day, early in the morning before I left for work, the three of them waited for me and blocked my car in the intersection. My sister hopped into my passenger's seat and said, ""dude, we're rescuing you! we know you're not happy!"" 


At this point I was overwhelmed with SO many emotions. I was surprised, shocked, angry, relieved and happy. I was mostly afraid though. I was afraid that my fiance would see us in the intersection, afraid of his anger, or what he would do, so we drove to a nearby diner to talk.  I knew I was unhappy, but at that point I felt as though I had alienated my friends and family to such a degree that they would never want to help me if I asked for it. I was so wrong. My fiance had led me to believe that I depended on him, that I *needed* him. When I saw that my mom, sister and friend were there that morning, I knew I was safe.


We waited at that diner while he left for work and quickly went to the house and packed as much of my belongings as we could as quickly as possible. I left many things behind, but it didn't matter. I left with my life. I left my fiance a note saying I was leaving and to not try to contact me (not that this meant anything, he went that night to my parent's house and assaulted my brother). That night I booked a flight out of the country because I feared for my safety. 


For the few days before my flight, I was paranoid that he would follow me. I slept in a different place each night at family's homes so he wouldn't know where to find me. Then I went to europe for 3 months, and that helped me get over the fear and paranoia. I slowly came back to the happy person I was before the relationship, and when I returned home, I felt healed.


I was lucky to have savings to pay my student loans, bills and expenses while I was away since I couldn't work, but most importantly, I was lucky to have friends and family there to help me through all of it. To this day, I tell everyone that my sister's friend Ellie saved my life. Had it not been for her ""mission impossible"" idea, I would probably still be living that hell.


If you are able to help someone, please do. They might just need that reassurance that someone will be there for them when they make a decision like this. It seems impossible when you're in the middle of it. ",t3_dlg0l,1285951640,photobombsquirrel,t5_2r2jt

If he really feared Jewish domination and censorship, his words would have died in his throat.

Precisely *because* he's not afraid of Jewish tyranny, he expects them not to destroy his career now, lol.

(Sadly for him, they have a track-record of doing just that.)

It's always seemed bizarre to me when Jewish activist groups try to play down the reality of Jews in positions of power in the media by silencing and destroying anyone in the media who says it. Sounds like irony-alarms should be going off in their heads. But they never seem to.

But enough about ""media control by sinister Semites"". I don't think Sanchez was making that point at all—merely saying that if you statistically grow up in upper Middle Class surroundings, with every creature comfort available to you, you don't ""get to play the oppressed minority"" card. And he has a point.

This is 21st Century America, not 1930s Germany. Jews have an extraordinarily comfortable living here, and demographically they do better than just about every other group. Some might find it galling to see a man in a limousine, driving to his broker's office, trying to equate his experience in America's with that of a black man, or an American Indian.

* Footnote: Following Sanchez's own logic, though, *he* is not part of an oppressed minority, either. Sanchez will undoubtedly try and play the ""Hispanic"" card, as if he's some Aztec from Mexico picking lettuce in the fields or a Nicaraguan Amerindian waiting for work outside a Walmart. No, Sanchez is a white Cuban, descended from Europeans—and he looks it. Walking down the street, he'd be no more ""discriminated against"" than NBC anchor Brian Williams. So for him to play the ""oppressed minority"" card is a laugh, seeing as he's descended from the oppressors [the Spaniards] and not from the oppressed [i.e., Amerindians and Negros].",t3_dliws,1285952345,Drooperdoo,t5_2cneq

Several Great Lakes ports are closer to European markets than East Coast or Gulf ports, which saves shippers time and money. For example, to travel from Baltimore, Maryland, to Liverpool, England, is 3,936 miles (6,334 km). Via the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway, ships can reach Detroit, Mich., by covering only 3,673 miles (5,911 km).
Ship travel saves energy, too, in comparison to trains, trucks and airplanes. A ship can move a ton of freight up to 500 miles on one gallon of fuel. A single 1,000-foot laker can carry as much cargo as six 100-car unit trains, which makes ships a very economical way to haul bulk quantities.

Fuel efficiency also translates into fewer air emissions than produced by trucks or trains. Ship transport is safer, too; serious accidents involving large cargo vessels are rare. Occasionally vessels become grounded but these incidents are usually much less serious than comparable railroad or truck accidents.

Shipping on the Great Lakes also provides many jobs for the region. In fact, more than 60,000 U.S. and Canadian jobs are directly dependent on cargo movements. In addition, hundreds of thousands of other jobs, many in the manufacturing sector, are tied to the maritime system. An abundance of steel mills were built along the shores of the Great Lakes and connecting channels because of the convenient, low-cost delivery of the industry's raw materials: iron ore, coal and limestone. Other manufacturing enterprises that use steel, such as automobile assembly in Detroit, Mich., also became popular and remain a hallmark of the region's economy.

While they are truly competitive, they are not necessarily cheap automobiles.  Not what Honda, Toyota, Chevy, GM and Ford are making.  And the price reflects the quality. Entry level Volkswaggens (the cheapest of the bunch) are still more expensive than entry level Fords/honda/toyotas/etc.

All I am saying is that it is simple economics. If you want to keep your product below a certain price point you either have to skimp on materials or wages.  If you are contractually obliged to not skimp on wages, well... you have to skimp on materials.

Southern Europe is encountering severe problems and cutting back, and Northern Europe is also encountering severe problems and cutting back but as long as they are due to ""other"" economic causes, well that means if the world were more ideal, then neither area would really *need* to be having such severe problems and would not need to be cutting back; so rather obviously their systems are functioning very, very well.

In cases where a state bank is simply established by law and an exectutive branch agency has broad autonomy over the operation of that bank, that is, in cases where one person or a small commission of people, could make the sale decision, it should theoretically be possible for the state to sell its share to private interests with enough liquid assets to allow all the depositors to make the withdrawals they'd like.

In the united states (as opposed to the developing world and eastern europe, for example), it is far more likely that the panic (fear of default) is caused by aparent or real instability in a private company than fear that the government will default on its obligations.  When a private bank cannot pay out what is demanded, it is by deffinition in default.  State banks generally have another option, which is to print more money and risk inflation.  For that reason, a government - backed bank is far less prone to a run on it than a private one.  However, the consequences of a private bank failing is that some depositors (who made a 'bad bet' about where to put their money) and investors (with the same bad bet) will take the whole share of the loss onto their own backs, whereas, if the government causes inflation to avoid a default, the pain is spread across the entire economy, and in this day and age, freqently the entire world economy.

That last question you ask is a tricky one.  Consumers (depositors) do not act rationally.  When the large firm comes with the cash infusion, and there is no factual reason for depositors to worry money isn't available (becasue, it is available), they can still be fearful.

That will make them vulnerable to Neocon takeover with a little help from the media and the Two-Party voter cowardice.

That's **the** problem. It's also the first criticism of the Tea Party I've read on /r/politics that was written by a person who knew anything about the Tea Party.

It was a _great_ idea, if you didn't think about it too hard. It's still an idea with a lot of potential. Democrats had the president, a majority in the House, and a supermajority in the Senate. They gave trillions of dollars in bailouts and ""stimulus"" money at a time when the nation was already unimaginably in debt. So what did we do? We built a European-style opposition coalition, uniting the libertarians and the old, deficit-hawking conservatives by focusing on combating uncontrolled spending and ignoring so-called ""social"" issues.

And it **worked**, too. Contrary to what you read on MSNBC and the Huffington Post, most Tea Partiers aren't casting their votes this election based on which candidate said the Ground Zero Mosque is an insult to America. They're voting based on who plans to reduce government spending. And that's saying something, because [it has basically never happened](http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/us_20th_century_chart.html) since WWII.

Gay marriage? We'll figure that out when we aren't 14 trillion dollars in debt. Abortion? It's waited this long; it can wait a little while longer.

It worked all the way up until we started talking about the war. That's where the divide kicks in, because that's the issue you **can't** ignore. The libertarians don't just believe the war is wrong. They also recognize that it has been a huge contributor to the debt. They know that paying down the debt isn't going to happen until the war is over. So you've got Tea Party candidates like BJ Lawson (R-NC) and John Dennis (R-CA) who are endorsed by Ron Paul and want to abandon the American empire as soon as possible. (Like, now.) And then you've got people who still believe that _any_ end to _any_ war is by definition a demonstration of left-wing anti-American sentiment. They think that people who oppose the wars want to weaken America, which may be true for certain anti-war activists, but is definitely not true for most.

This issue split the Tea Party because it won't go away. To the libertarians, it's way too expensive to ignore. To the conservatives, it carries too much symbolic weight. They think if the libertarian presence dominates the Tea Party movement, it will just be another conservative loss to the left.

American cheese is a direct product of war-time conservation. It was once made from a blend of cheeses, like Colby and Cheddar. Now American cheese is usually manufactured from a set of ingredients such as milk, whey, milk fats, milk protein cultures, whey protein concentrate, and salts. In 1942, U.S. officials imposed severe restrictions on cheese consumption as a wartime rationing.  These restrictions disallowed the sale or consumption of all types of cheese other than American made Cheeses. This was due to a combination of factors: availability of cheese from continental Europe, abundance of the American cheese variety, and a perceived need to encourage wartime patriotism among citizens. The ban took effect on May 4, 1942. Like SPAM and M&amp;Ms, the blended ""American"" cheese became a staple in many households and a traditional ingredient in things like ""cheeseburgers"" and American grilled cheese sandwiches.

If you think the Confederacy represented racism and prejudice, you are a fucking idiot.  Pick up any book of historic significance and you will quickly learn the difference between [propaganda](http://www.civilwarhome.com/propaganda.htm) and facts.

If you argue for strict construction of the Constitution, you are arguing the Confederate position; when you oppose pork-barrel spending,
you are arguing the Confederate position; when you oppose protective
tariffs, you are arguing the Confederate position; when you argue for the Bill of Rights, you are arguing the Confederate position; and when you argue that the Constitution limits the power and jurisdiction of the federal government, you are arguing the Confederate position.

One of things that gets lost when you adopt the politically
correct oversimplification that the War Between the States was a Civil War all about slavery is a whole treasure trove of American political history.

In fact, It was not a civil war.  A civil war is when two or more
factions contend for control of one government.  At no time did the South intend to or attempt to overthrow the government of the United States.  The Southern states simply withdrew from what they correctly viewed as a voluntary union. They formed their own union and adopted their own constitution.

Abraham Lincoln's invasion of the South was entirely without any constitutional authority.  And it's as plain as an elephant at a tea party that Lincoln did not seek to preserve the union in order to end slavery.  All you have to do is read his first inaugural address.  What Lincoln didn't want to lose was the tax revenue generated by the South.

As Northern states gained a majority in both houses, they
began to use the South as a cash cow.  Here's how it worked.  Most
Southerners who exported cotton bartered the cotton in Europe for goods.  When the protective tariffs were imposed, that meant Southerners had to pay them.  To make matters worse, the North would then use the revenue for pork-barrel projects in their states.  The South was faced with either paying high tariffs and receiving no benefits from the revenue or buying artificially high-priced Northern goods.

The South opposed pork-barrel spending.  Its correct view
was that because the federal government was merely the agent of all the states, whatever money it spent should be of equal benefit.  The South's position on public lands was that they belonged to all the people, and the federal government had no authority to give them away to private interests.

The South also believed that whether a new state would
authorize slavery or forbid it was a matter for the people in that territory to decide for themselves.  The South never insisted that any new state had to be a slave state, but it opposed the Northern position that any new state must be a free state.

As Northern states gained a majority in both houses, they
began to use the South as a cash cow.  Here's how it worked.  Most
Southerners who exported cotton bartered the cotton in Europe for goods.  When the protective tariffs were imposed, that meant Southerners had to pay them.  To make matters worse, the North would then use the revenue for pork-barrel projects in their states.  The South was faced with either paying high tariffs and receiving no benefits from the revenue or buying artificially high-priced Northern goods.

Northerners had announced that they would not be bound by the
Constitution. What you had was the rise of modern nationalism fighting the original republic founded by the American Revolution.  So  regardless of where you were born, you might be a Southerner philosophically.

First off, even bringing up gun control, etc. The typos and shrill tone don't do this any favors either.

Preface: I'm American and like our system, despite the times it's screwed me over. I've been a server, cook, cashier, various service industry, etc. from 16-23. It was very formative for me and something I take pride in.

I'm strongly in favor of meritorious tipping (which is basically what the States has). You get tipped on how you perform: making sure the table has what they need, presuming/predicting needs, appearance/hygiene, knowledge/suggestion of the menu and (this is a big X factor) likability. There's more but those are my off-the-cuff basics.

Now, most places with entrees less than $20, the server (and you, perhaps) are just getting through. They're being polite/nice/serviceable enough to get you to order stuff, maybe upsell, get a decent tip and get you out for their next table to come in. Doubly true if it's a busy Fri. or Sat. night.

Usually, the higher up on the price point scale you go, the higher your celing for potential service excellence is. That's been my experience. You'll tip more by design but it's also more likely you'll tip a higher percentage, as these servers actually know what they're doing. They're more likely to approach their ""job"" as a trade or even a career. In other words, they genuinely care and aren't worried about the speed of the revolving door of customers. They'll get compensated well pretty much regardless.

I've eaten lunch at Per SE, a specific restaurant the author cites. That is a fucking dream come true service-wise. I can attest to that. Now that restaurant does go against my staunch belief of meritorious, percentage-based tipping.

Really fancy, Michelin-starred or Gayot-reviewed restaurants are wild cards... and they should be. That's how they have the unique destination-dining characters and brands they're known for. Plus, these restaurants (especially the one with prix-fixe menus) take lots of cues from EU restaurants (usually French, Spanish or Italian), so it's not out of context that they'd do that.

With the tax-and-tip-included menus/restaurants, my interpretation of it is the implication of ""Here it is. One price. Just lay that down. We'll take care of the rest."" And that experience at Per SE was like a dream. Didn't have to worry about judging timeliness, hustle, attitude, etc. I could just focus on the marvelous food and decor.

Would that work in most American restaurants, though? Not at all.",t3_dlhed,1285959802,paulderev,t5_2rete

Eastern Europe is great for hard rock. I recommend [Coma](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbL942M0OrU), the Polish band (there's also a Romanian Coma which used to do all sorts of [ska-like](http://www.youtube.com/user/comaofficial#p/u/16/VTsjwqymeHg) stuff but which now sticks mostly with [the harder stuff](http://www.youtube.com/user/comaofficial#p/u/4/S-da0-GoBaI), and which in any case isn't as good as the Poles).

I would like to repeat someone else's suggestion of [Distemper](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ft01ltAlicU) for a fun sort of Russian ska-gypsy-punk mix.

[The Corries](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1sDd0GjMm0) are an excellent old Scottish folk band that I like to listen to when I crave a powerfully sincere voice.

I'm a bit of a Hungarian fanboy. As such, i can offer a few magyar musics. [Hiperkarma](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKMnHmbQzYM) is a fun hyperkinetic rock-ish group (one of my favorite things about foreign music is how easily they break what you think about genres). As part of Eastern Europe, Hungary is best at heavy or doomy metal like the godfather of Hungarian metal [Kalapács](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUmBvxIFAtA), or the droney [Nevergreen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANF69JKIVc0), but [Tűzmadár](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYwWqBvy8XE) is a pretty great power metal band, if you're into that sort of thing. For straight-up rock, it's hard to get better than the powerhouse [Tankcsapda](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sagxCNjoQJY). And then there's [Aljas Kúszóbab](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vwylx9-ikEg) for a more pop-punk feel.

I'm a huge fan of Latin American folk rock, especially the vallenato/cumbia of [Carlos Vives](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKq42-YoOUg) and [Cabas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROO3EB-9MIQ). but I would suggest just getting a super-mix of merengue, bachata, salsa, samba (someone else mentioned [Bossa Cuca Nova](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuY7BVD6sSg), and i heartily second the suggestion), and whatever else you can find from the caribbean and latin america. I sincerely believe that if only one language group should be allowed to make music, it should be Spanish-speakers. I guess the Portuguese speakers can come too. Speaking of which, [Skank](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Azi92Wlv9BY) is fun Brazilian ska-punk-whatever.

Other exciting Spanish things include [WarCry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IFZpM9hOpU), good ol' power metal. And that song contains the absolute best power metal scream of all time. If you don't have time to listen to the whole thing, skip forward to 5:18 and sit back. [Mägo de Oz](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j25-RjaP__w) is extremely fun folk metal.

Other people have covered Japanese bands pretty well... The Pillows are fun, Shiina Ringo's got a great voice, and everyone likes to use English just for fun, but it's all kinda weird.

The preeminent rock band in China, [Cui Jian](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmcH0pJQUOs), didn't get that way for no reason.

I'm not a big hip-hop guy, but I truly and unironically enjoy [MC Sniper](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTq2wmkfdLI). Something about Korean makes all shitty genres (hip-hop, house, pop) bearable and even enjoyable.

Hamas is an organization that has a political wing and a military wing, much like Hizbollah and Fatah.  Why do you think that every military organization has to have a website?  Is there an Al-Qaeda.org?  Are you seriously unaware of Hamas as a terrorist organization?

&gt; This is not a terrorist organization.

The PLO is no longer designated a terrorist organization, but it certainly started out as one. Are you unaware of its history?

&gt; If 10 civilians come at 1 heavily armed soldier, I can expect that soldier to kill all ten if he is Israeli and they are Palestinian. Is this what you are saying?

Obviously, by ""come at"" I meant attack.  And yes, if 10 people, civilian or not, Palestinians or not, attack one person (Israeli or not, soldier or not) who is better armed and protected, I can expect that one person to kill all ten.

&gt; &gt; I mean, if you're armed with a gun and I come at you with a knife, nobody expects you not to use your gun to protect yourself.

&gt; I do. What about the attacks on the freedom flotilla? They were practically executed. There was not a single gun. If you want to maintain some kind of formal peace, asymmetrical use of force should be kept to a minimum.

Then you're very naive.  Why would you risk your life for nothing if you have the tools to defend yourself?

&gt; &gt; Hamas also has money. They tax the tunnels and they get ""donations"" from friendly countries. However, they don't invest in their lives.

&gt; They can't even leave or re-enter their nation freely. EU fuel supplied to them is consistently denied. Do not act like they have the freedom to prosper that you are suggesting.

Which is why they have tunnels from which they bring in whatever they can, and which they tax heavily.

&gt; &gt; They invest in Israeli deaths.


&gt; Inflammatory. Citation please.

""Inflammatory""?  Is this some court of law?  I'm free to inflame if those are the facts.  The fact is that Hamas has spent many resources on rockets, bombs, mortars, anti-tank weapons, attempts to kidnap Israelis and other offensive things, and very little on shelter and economic advancement for their civilians.

&gt; Ever heard of the conditions on these reservations? Not good. The fact of the matter is, there was a genocide of the Indian people in America.

That's right, there was a genocide, but they didn't kill them all, nor did they assimilate them.

&gt; You were trying to paint Jews as the native-Americans of Palestine. You white washed the fact that the Arabs have been the vast majority for 1300 years. I read it somewhere, 78 and 150.. 2000 years ago are not so different.

And white people have been the vast majority in North America for the past few centuries.  I guess those Native Americans should just let bygones be bygones.

&gt; &gt; And if they decided to buy land all over the US and live alongside white people,

&gt; They have no money, their land and resources were plundered..

Ever heard of casinos on Indian reservations.  They have the money to do it if they wanted to. Besides, I didn't say they would do it, I just asked what you'd expect the whites to do in such a situation.

&gt; You are trying to suggest that all the land Israel now occupies was obtained rightfully? There are constant illegal land grabs still.

Yes.  It was occupied in a war of defense.  It may make certain sense for Israel to transfer control to somebody else, like it did with Sinai, but Israel certainly obtained it rightfully.

&gt; And I cannot justify the land white people took from native-Americans in the first place, this is not a parallel to Palestinian plight.

Hamas does not recognize Israel.

I don't know if they did, I don't know that they didn't.  

I will say that, as an avid fan of South Park, I've noticed that what you are saying reflects very well the ideas that Matt and Trey espoused in their episode ""Cherokee Hair Tampons.""  I completely agree with you, that differentiating Native Americans from Euro-Americans almost always brings about negative effects and attitudes.  However, this was not my intention when I used them in my previous example.

Simply put, N.A.s were the first group that came to mind that participated in segmented trading groups, whether intra- or inter-group, or with the European settlers.  (Man, what a shitty trade, maize for smallpox?  That's definitely not free-market trading.)

I was not trying, in any way, to demonize or idealize N.A.s as a group, race, or anything else.  Truth be told, I would've used Norse Vikings as my example if I didn't know that they simply pillaged and took whatever they wanted.  Major ancient cultures (Greeks, Romans) had governments in place that (if I'm not wrong) prohibited free-market trading in favor of giving their higher-ups comfy housing.  Fiefdoms, same as above.  Genghis Khan, like the Vikings, just took what he wanted.  This all said, N.A.s were kinda the go-to group, in naive hopes that it wouldn't blow up in my face.  (**NOT**onmyfaceplease.)

I apologize if I've hit a nerve, that wasn't my intention.  It was honestly a mix of being over-tired, being braindead and not thinking my comments through as much as I should have.  My intention was not to roll in here and start denigrating any social or racial groups.

At the very bottom of it, though, why must so much be read into my statement, which was that N.A.s *might* have traded without having tariffs and such?  As far as I know, they never coined money, so, to me, the idea of taxing a trade of pelts or food seems less likely than it would in a transaction involving minted currency.  

Again, I could be wrong here, maybe for every 10 pelts or for every X # of pieces of food, the chief of the tribe got 1.  Who knows, I certainly don't.

On another note, what happens if a more sophisticated, more highly-evolved race comes to Earth, and I say, ""wow, they have quality P, which is ideal, I wish I had quality P!""  Is that still putting them down?  When does differentiating groups (because of superiority) stop being de-humanizing?  Can't I say that (some) NFL players have the ideal qualities of immense size and speed without them being necessarily animalistic?  Why is everything that isn't status quo negative?  

Is it just that I attributed ideal traits to a race of people that makes it offensive, instead of to a mixed-race group?  What if I had said, ""I bet the people who lived on Easter Island way back had free-market trading.""  Would that be de-humanizing to them?  

My buddy Steve has a thick, full beard.  I will never be able to grow a full beard.  I think that being able to choose how to cut one's facial hair is ideal, compared to not being able to grow a goatee or muttonchops.  Did I just de-humanize my friend because he has a quality that I find ideal?  Would it be different if I said ""Italians can do better Rocky impersonations than I can, and impersonating celebrities is ideal.""  Is that dehumanizing to them?  

Is it dehumanizing to say that northern Europeans' ability to have blond hair and blue eyes is ideal?  Isn't the simple identification of a group as having particular traits exclusive to humans exactly NOT de-humanizing?",t1_c113lt4,1285962245,r_walker,t5_2qh63

Lincoln also famously said that if he could re-unite the Union by not emancipating the slaves he would do it, if he could re-unite by emancipating all he would do it and if he could re-unite by emancipating some he could do it too.

People would come in daily to purchase power adapters for there electric devices so that they could be used in foreign countries with different voltage levels and plug styles. We sold both plug adapters and power transformers. Plug adapters that simply allow for an American device to be plugged into a foreign socket never cost more than $10 and are usually closer to $5. If your device requires 120 volts, but your in a country with 240 volt sockets, then you need to buy the $30 to $40 transformer so that you don't fry your device.

Now the beauty of modern electronics like computers, cellphones, cameras and the like is that they come with chargers that will automatically accept both US and international voltages. There is no need to buy the transformer, all you need is the cheap plug adapter that's country specific. This is why every time that a customer would come to the counter with a transformer I would ask them what it was that they were planning on taking with them on their trip. The vast majority of people were taking things that did not require the expensive transformer and almost everyday I would save a customer $40 or more because they had NO IDEA that those power bricks that come with many electronic devices almost always accept a wide range of voltages. 

Now the owner of the store would have LOVED for me to sell a $40 item to each and every customer, but because we knew certain things that the they didn't we felt obligated to share with them what we knew. You see I had expertise that the customer was lacking and rather than taking advantage of that gap in knowledge, I ensured that the customer was buying only what they needed. 

Could they have found a use for that transformer? Maybe. Did they need it? Certainly not. They demonstrated a certain amount of trust in me when they asked what they needed specifically for their trip to Europe or wherever and I never took advantage of that trust to increase the profits of the store. Had I attempted to sell them that transformer when nothing that they were taking required it I would be ripping them off, plain and simple. 

What would be the point of my position at the store if I expected the customer to know everything about travel power adapters and foreign power infrastructure before they came in? Surely I could be replaced by the equivalent of an ATM if that were the case. 

There are those out there who feel justified attempting to take ever bit of money that they can from a customer, even if it means selling them something that they don't require or can be found for far less, maybe even free. We on the other hand recognized the value in treating others with respect and not taking advantage of the customer's ignorance.

Not to mention random temples (well, they're not ""random,"" just seems like it when they're wedged between skyscrapers).  Makes it feel like you're in many cities, not one.

It was one of the few cities that didn't get heavily bombed during WWII, thus all the old temples still remain scattered and ingrained in the city.  Much more culture, in my opinion.  Hiroshima was another pretty cool city, too.  Since it was totally destroyed by the atomic bomb, everything in the city is ""modern.""  I thought it was cool seeing the baseball field literally right across the street from the memorial park (kinda crazy how the culture that brought such a tragedy that happened there now is being embraced - baseball, that is).

No it's saying that someone shouldn't be enslaved to people who lend them money. If someone can't pay that's a failure on their part, but it's also a failure on the part of the lender who gave them money without examining the risk sufficiently. That's why we have the concept of credit rating too, which is part of the issue here.

&gt;Whether D was a dick or not doesn't really come in to this issue at this point

It does when you abandoned the metaphor and examine the reality where a lot of the income going to the state assumed a certain level of market activity that now isn't happening because of the current meltdown.

&gt;And C is giving way too much stuff to E and quite honestly can no longer afford it.

That is wildly inaccurate. Governments largely exist to transfer money to businesses. There's a reason why we all have the same defensive forces, and it's because the mythology of the state is required to explain why you're giving money to business in the form of bailouts or even just government purchases. 

I'll also note that [France and Germany aren't exactly saints in this situation](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/world/europe/30iht-turkey.html).

&gt;While E can repeat that D is a dick, it just doesn't really enter to the equation here.

But my point here is that there are options other than what's being proposed and what's going on now is just uncritical acceptance of the advice of people who caused the problem in the first place. Advice that bundles actual remedies with solutions that they would just like to see happen.

&gt;Yes but you're taking it out on A via C, neither of which was abusive

The solution isn't to just sit by and do nothing, or even in this case help them.

I responded angrily in another thread earlier today about the generally low quality of American food, because we do have great food traditions, but it is usually true that the poor in America do not eat as well as the poor in many other countries, in terms of variety and healthfulness.  There is a lower point of rock-bottom because of our willingness to use industrial methods to mass-produce things when those who make little money in other countries are forced to create a lot of things from scratch.  

Along those same lines, of course it is possible to get great reasonably priced cheese from domestic sources, but to a large extent Americans have been socialized to accept lower quality fare.  In a sense it is part of the overall cultural casualty of the post-war age, along with sealed microwaveable dinners and low-quality fast food(in my experience, McDonald's restaurants and other fast food locations in other countries are at a higher quality simply because people expect it to be so).  Spray cheese is something of a gimmick for people who are at the absolute lowest end of the scale and desire something that has some kind of resemblance to cheese and a convenience factor so high that one doesn't even need to do the work to cut the cheese or ask a deli worker to cut it.  

In my opinion, most Americans who actually truly like cheese are on a different level.  True cheese lovers seek out the good stuff, and maybe there's something to the idea that given the American melting-pot culture, there's less of an inborn appreciation for cheese, less of a cultural backbone than might develop in a European culture.  For example, my family is Chinese, so I grew up eating those Kraft Singles which are by no means real cheese, but we never knew the difference, so it was a long time before I understood what real cheese was.  Spray cheese is merely an issue of wanting something vaguely cheese-like, which is true enough of the stuff from the list of ingredients.  Someone who just wants an item that is cheesy ""enough"" without being a true aficionado (again, something more difficult to come across in a culture that doesn't grow up knowing how glorious cheese can truly be) will go for spray cheese because it's close to what they have in mind, and very convenient.  This of course doesn't hold true at all for those areas of America where dairy farms and cheese production are a way of life.

Another part of this is the fact that many similar items were invented or were the product of innovations made during wartime periods, Hawaii's particular love of spam being included, because...well, when you go through a period of years where that's the only source of meat you can get a hold of, there is some level of appreciation developed.  Again, there is also the factor of familiarity.  For many people in Philadelphia, where I spent the last year and a half, getting your cheesesteak ""Whiz wit"" is something that you're used to, something that tastes ""right"" with a cheesesteak, especially from a lower quality place, because in a certain way it makes sense.  You wouldn't waste a high quality wine with the kind of meal you'd eat at 2am in the morning.  Either you enjoy the wine with food at the equivalent level of quality, or the food with alcohol of an equivalent quality.  

I agree that American culture has a long way to go when it comes to the proper appreciation of cheese, but we're a product of the culture that came before us.  In wartime we needed cheap substitutes, and we got used to them.  Having this ingrained into our way of life, there's a difficulty switching out to a higher quality product, not merely because we value cheap stuff more (and it pretty much always is cheaper), but because when you grow up eating one thing, even if there's a higher quality version, part of you insists that the lower quality thing you remember from childhood is *right.*",t3_dll4v,1285967614,quivering_manflesh,t5_2qh55

                                    Is the United States a Christian Nation
Absolutely not. Many people believe the United States is a Christian nation based on their own religious beliefs. As I look back and read the facts of our founding fathers, they dictate otherwise. I have to wonder what they thought our country would become for the future generations.
In the first Amendment of the Constitution it forbids Congress from making or enforcing any law that is in support of ANY religion. It is the primary law of the land; “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” Our founding fathers wrote this Constitution; therefore they had no intention on the United States being a Christian nation.
In the 1796 Treaty of Tripoli it states that the United States was “In no sense founded on the Christian religion.” It was written under the presidency of George Washington and Signed under the presidency of John Adams.
The only Bible ever to pass through Congress was the Aitken Bible which is an Americanized, edited version of the Bible. The war with Britain cut off the supply of all Bibles to the United States with the result that on September 11, 1777, the Continental Congress passed a motion that would have instructed its Committee of Commerce to import 20,000 Bibles from “Scotland, Holland or elsewhere.” This, however, was not a final vote. A second motion was made to pass an actual resolution to import the Bibles, but was postponed and never considered again. A later attempt to have Congress buy these Bibles and give them to soldiers being discharged was rejected by Congress. 
Thomas Jefferson said to Baron von Humboldt in 1813 “History furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free civil government. This marks the lowest grade of ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will always avail themselves for their own purpose.” Thomas Jefferson wrote the Wall of Separation letter on January 1, 1802 stating his urgency in the separation of church and state.  In 1814 he wrote a letter to Dr. Thomas Cooper saying, “Christianity neither is, nor ever was, a part of the common law.” Thomas Jefferson believed “Christianity was founded on fables and mythology.” Although Thomas Jefferson believed in a Creator, his concept of it resembled that of the God of Deism (nature’s God). He rejected the superstitions and mysticism of Christianity and even went so far as to edit these gospels, removing the miracles and mysticism of Jesus leaving only what he deemed the correct moral philosophy of Jesus. 
John Adams, another of our founding fathers, wrote a letter to Charles Cushing on October 19, 1756 saying “Twenty times in the course of my late reading, have I been upon the point of breaking out, ‘this would be the best of all possible worlds, if there were no religion in it.’” Adams served as the sixth president of the United States from March 4, 1825 to March 4, 1829. He took the oath of office on a book of laws, instead of the more traditional Bible, to preserve the separation of church and state.
Benjamin Franklin wrote in Poor Richard’s Almanac “In the affairs of the world, men are saved, not by faith, but by the lack of it.” He goes on to say, “Lighthouses are more helpful than churches.”
James Madison wrote a letter to Wm. Bradford on April 1, 1774, “Religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprise.” James Madison later wrote a letter objecting the use of government land for churches in 1803 saying, “The purpose of separation of church and state is to keep forever from these shores the ceaseless strife that has soaked the soil of Europe in blood for centuries.” 
In conclusion, the United States was not founded to be a Christian nation. Our founding fathers may have been religious but look at where they came from. They fled Europe in search of a new land to get away from the religious dictatorship. Based on the facts of our founding fathers it is proven that the United States is not a Christian Nation. If our founding fathers based our nation on Christianity then they would have put some kind of reference to Christ, God or even Creator in the constitution.""Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man &amp; his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, &amp; not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof', thus building a wall of separation between Church &amp; State.""

My respect for Jews is grounded in my respect for their intelligence, their humor, their humanity.

My feelings of ambivalence arise from their occasional lapses: Like their behavior during the slave-trade. It was based in the Netherlands, because that's where Jews flocked after Spain expelled them. Black nationalists are actually right when they say that most of the slave ships were Jewish-owned.

In fact, the seminal book on the Russian Mob was originally entitled ""The Jewish Mob,"" but the publisher made the journalist change it. 

To be fair, *inside* Russia, the mob is mostly Armenians and Chechyns. But *outside* Russia, it's historically been a predominantly Jewish enterprise, since Jews could acquire passports more easily, and already had an international infrastructure set up for them. They used the networks and liquid assets set up during the diamond trade to funnel other stuff internationally: like child pornography, illegal weapons, drugs, white slavery, etc.

In 1998 Israeli writer David Weinberg wrote a series of articles, calling Israel the white slavery capital of the world, and many subsequent journalists have agreed with him (citing all the Eastern European girls being kidnapped and waking up in brothels in Tel Aviv). Likewise, Jews run the Ectasy and Heroin trade in most major US cities.

So, yes, they're intelligent. But sometimes that intelligence is used for good [Einstein, Jonas Salk] and other times it's used for evil [like when Meyer Lansky created the infrastructure for the modern America mafia].

They've been great civil rights leaders helping blacks, and they've been slave-traders *selling* blacks.

They've been cosmospolitan internationalists decrying the evils of the nation-state, and they've been nationalistic zealots doing everything they could to maintain their own nation-state.

Like all great characters, they embody at one and the same time, all the greatest aspirations of Mankind and all of its shortcomings.

But, then, all great peoples do the same. Only tiny people are totally consistent. What did Walt Whitman say? ""I contradict myself? So be it. I contradict myself. I am huge. I contain multitudes!""

And so does the Jewish people.",t1_c1149rd,1285969760,Drooperdoo,t5_2cneq

&gt; Sept. 1945: Madalyn has an affair with William J. Murray Jr., who fathers her eldest child of the same name. She sues Roths for divorce and begins calling herself Madalyn Murray, even though she never married Murray.

&gt; 1949: Madalyn moves to Houston and gets a law degree from South Texas College of Law. She fails the bar exam.

&gt; 1957-60: Madalyn attends socialist group meetings. Attempts to defect to Soviet Union at Soviet Embassy in Paris. Soviets deny her entry.

&gt; 1993: Madalyn and son Jon Garth Murray, in midst of litigation over the ownership of an atheist publication called The Truth Seeker, begin working to hide assets in anticipation of losing a lawsuit filed against them in San Diego.

&gt; Oct. 27, 1998: Waters has a probation hearing in front of Travis Co. Magistrate Jim Coronado, who lectures Waters that his cable bill of $85 is too high, and that ""if your interest is in staying out of jail,"" he'd better get current on his restitution payments to the American Atheists.

Spanish aren't *enslaved* to anyone if some of the social benefits get cut. Nordic countries, Germany etc cut benefits all the damn time when financial conditions require. Somehow the bounce back quite wonderfully.

But Spain could default I guess. It'll give them lots of excess cash, but will likely get them thrown out of euro. This, combined with just defaulting, will make loaning money extremely expensive for Spain. The image hit will also have a very real impact on the economy when the richer parts of Europe start to recall that Spain wasn't actually part of the cool kids club from like 1700 to 1980, during which it was kind of 3rd world. Once demoted back there, it'll have real problems.

&gt; It does when you abandoned the metaphor and examine the reality where a lot of the income going to the state assumed a certain level of market activity that now isn't happening because of the current meltdown.

Well the government can save doing something else. What it can't do it spent 2 euros for every 1.50 it gets, especially when none will be willing to lend it the extra 50c. So somehow you have to cut expenses, even if you default (which will reduce costs probably by around 20%, but will drop income even further due to the global reaction to such an event).

&gt; That is wildly inaccurate. Governments largely exist to transfer money to businesses.

What? In whose world? (Perhaps in the US, but in Europe they typically move money from the rich to the poor and build infrastructure)

&gt; I'll also note that France and Germany aren't exactly saints in this situation.

The debate - as far as I can tell - is about Spain defaulting. I'd say yes, France and Germany are pretty damn stable in that regard, particularly Germany. It's hard to imagine a country *less* likely to default.

&gt; There are plenty of other options available, they can work gain sharing programs through the union or start state-run enterprises (they are supposedly a socialist government after all).

State-run enterprises are notoriously inefficient, but sure, why not. The problem is that you need money to start those, and none will want to give you money while you're teetering on the edge *and* being socialist in your leanings. I guess you could go with IOUs, but I'm guessing there'll be rioting on the streets over that as well.

Frankly they should just look at the countries that are doing fine through all of this, and adapt measures from them. Competitive marketplace works wonders. You can have income transfers, but you *must* have a working market economy under it, or you're just moving around promises that none will actually fulfill - just ask the successful social democracies of this planet (which all do remarkably well in the highly capitalistic comparisons of national competitiveness).",t1_c1145jc,1285971100,Delheru,t5_2cneq

Within CA only the worst commercial grade weed comes from Mexico and is effected by the cartels.  One of the concerns lifted by the current medical dispensaries is that once completely legalized in CA large scale operations will put most of the small guys out of business and flood the market with cheap weed.  This would actually take business away from the cartels.

People wouldn't just be able to drive across the border with a semi truck full of pot.  Like any other product there would be tariffs and/or duties levied on anything imported.

This would increase the cost of getting weed into CA from Mexico.

The difficulties other countries face are related to the political, social, economic, and cultural realities of the time.

It was impoverished, backwards, just ended a civil war, and was a Communist country with crappy ties at best with the defender of the Communist world - the USSR.  Many of the problems developing countries face will be overcome with time.  The question is - does the US want to be the one that helps them do it, or the asshole of a country that sat around spending shitloads of money on itself.  

I too have friends who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan.  In Kurdish controlled sections of Iraq, it looks like a modern country - almost like Turkey.  It is safe, developed, and relatively well off.  On the other hand, Ramadi was like a shithole.  Which of these is indicative of Iraq?  Would you judge the entirety of the US based on the gang warfare between the Crips and Bloods?  Would you judge the US based on Martha's Vineyard?  Neither would be helpful.

To look there is to see some hope for their future.  Kandahar, on the other hand, doesn't look quite so good.  Tribalism and ""stone age"" technology has nothing to do with it.

It depends on whether you are talking about an African or European swallow.

*Based upon published species-wide averages of wing length and body mass, initial Strouhal estimates based on those averages and cross-species comparisons, the Lund wind tunnel study of birds flying at a range of speeds, and revised Strouhal numbers based on that study gives an estimate that the average cruising airspeed velocity of an unladen European Swallow is roughly 11 meters per second, or 24 miles per hour.

Just Some Of The History of Experimentation on Human Guinea Pigs

1931 - Dr. Cornelius Rhoads, under the auspices of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Investigations, infects human subjects with cancer cells. He later goes on to establish the U.S. Army Biological Warfare facilities in Maryland, Utah, and Panama, and is named to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. While there, he begins a series of radiation exposure experiments on American soldiers and civilian hospital patients.

1932 - The Tuskegee Syphilis Study begins. 200 black men diagnosed with syphilis are never told of their illness, are denied treatment, and instead are used as human guinea pigs in order to follow the progression and symptoms of the disease. They all subsequently die from syphilis, their families never told that they could have been treated.

1935 - The Pellagra Incident. After millions of individuals die from pellagra over a span of two decades, the U.S. Public Health Service finally acts to stem the disease. The director of the agency admits it had known for at least 20 years that Pellagra is caused by a niacin deficiency but failed to act since most of the deaths occurred within poverty-stricken black populations.

1940 - Four hundred prisoners in Chicago are infected with malaria in order to study the effects of new and experimental drugs to combat the disease. Nazi doctors later on trial at Nuremberg cite this American study to defend their own actions during the Holocaust.

1942 - Chemical Warfare Services begins mustard gas experiments on approximately 4,000 servicemen. The experiments continue until 1945 and made use of Seventh Day Adventists who chose to become human guinea pigs rather than serve on active duty.

1943 - In response to Japan's full-scale germ warfare program, the U.S. begins research on biological weapons at Fort Detrick, MD.

1944 - U.S. Navy uses human subjects to test gas masks and clothing. Individuals were locked in a gas chamber and exposed to mustard gas and lewisite.

1945 - Project Paperclip is initiated. The U.S. State Department, Army intelligence, and the CIA recruit Nazi scientists and offer them immunity and secret identities in exchange for work on top secret government projects in the United States.

1945 - ""Program F"" is implemented by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). This is the most extensive U.S. study of the health effects of fluoride, which was the key chemical component in atomic bomb production. One of the most toxic chemicals known to man, fluoride, it is found, causes marked adverse effects to the central nervous system but much of the information is squelched in the name of national security because of fear that lawsuits would undermine full-scale production of atomic bombs.

1946 - Patients in VA hospitals are used as guinea pigs for medical experiments. In order to allay suspicions, the order is given to change the word ""experiments"" to ""investigations"" or ""observations"" whenever reporting a medical study performed in one of the nation's veteran's hospitals.

1947 - Colonel E.E. Kirkpatrick of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission issues a secret document (Document 07075001, January 8, 1947) stating that the agency will begin administering intravenous doses of radioactive substances to human subjects.

1947 - The CIA begins its study of LSD as a potential weapon for use by American intelligence. Human subjects (both civilian and military) are used with and without their knowledge.

1950 - Department of Defense begins plans to detonate nuclear weapons in desert areas and monitor downwind residents for medical problems and mortality rates.

1950 - In an experiment to determine how susceptible an American city would be to biological attack, the U.S. Navy sprays a cloud of bacteria from ships over San Francisco. Monitoring devices are situated throughout the city in order to test the extent of infection. Many residents become ill with pneumonia-like symptoms.

1951 - Department of Defense begins open air tests using disease-producing bacteria and viruses. Tests last through 1969 and there is concern that people in the surrounding areas have been exposed.

1953 - U.S. military releases clouds of zinc cadmium sulfide gas over Winnipeg, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Fort Wayne, the Monocacy River Valley in Maryland, and Leesburg, Virginia. Their intent is to determine how efficiently they could disperse chemical agents.

1953 - Joint Army-Navy-CIA experiments are conducted in which tens of thousands of people in New York and San Francisco are exposed to the airborne germs Serratia marcescens and Bacillus glogigii.

1953 - CIA initiates Project MKULTRA. This is an eleven year research program designed to produce and test drugs and biological agents that would be used for mind control and behavior modification. Six of the subprojects involved testing the agents on unwitting human beings.

1955 - The CIA, in an experiment to test its ability to infect human populations with biological agents, releases a bacteria withdrawn from the Army's biological warfare arsenal over Tampa Bay, Fl.

1956 - U.S. military releases mosquitoes infected with yellow fever over Savannah, Ga and Avon Park, Fl. Following each test, Army agents posing as public health officials test victims for effects.

1960 - The Army Assistant Chief-of-Staff for Intelligence (ACSI) authorizes field testing of LSD in Europe and the Far East. Testing of the European population is code named Project THIRD CHANCE; testing of the Asian population is code named Project DERBY HAT.

1965 - Project CIA and Department of Defense begin Project MKSEARCH, a program to develop a capability to manipulate human behavior through the use of mind-altering drugs.

1965 - Prisoners at the Holmesburg State Prison in Philadelphia are subjected to dioxin, the highly toxic chemical component of Agent Orange used in Viet Nam. The men are later studied for development of cancer, which indicates that Agent Orange had been a suspected carcinogen all along.

1966 - CIA initiates Project MKOFTEN, a program to test the toxicological effects of certain drugs on humans and animals.

1966 - U.S. Army dispenses Bacillus subtilis variant niger throughout the New York City subway system. More than a million civilians are exposed when army scientists drop lightbulbs filled with the bacteria onto ventilation grates.

1967 - CIA and Department of Defense implement Project MKNAOMI, successor to MKULTRA and designed to maintain, stockpile and test biological and chemical weapons.

1968 - CIA experiments with the possibility of poisoning drinking water by injecting chemicals into the water supply of the FDA in Washington, D.C.

So, the names they use would be similar.  And their general religion was somewhat similar for the same common-source reasons.

In fact, quoting wikipedia as some sort of legitimate source to make your point is pretty poor. It was an authoritarian regime that complied with what Moscow wanted. 

With this notion, it carried broad restrictions on trade avenues. Many western markets refused to trade with communist regimes. Let's not forget that the east was much less developed than the United States and the West as a whole means that resources went to other places than to making sure the exterior of buildings were maintained. For the entire lack of wealth that the east had, they managed to still carry on. Maybe not to western standards, but the western standards did not exist after the fall of the Nazi regime in 1945.

Credit and debit cards in the United States are physically equivalent.  When I swipe my card the retailer--or the payment terminal--asks me:  ""Debit or credit?""

There are hybrids known as ""check cards"" that function as a credit card to the retailer and are processed by Visa and MasterCard but are drafted from a checking account after about three days.  There are entire grand shenanigans and Federal legislation about how much banks charge for overdraft fees incurred in the 3 day processing window and how they order them.  Some banks allow you to kite, but that's not a good idea.  Some check cards offer credit card like rewards discussed below.

The drawbacks of check cards can be ameliorated by always having a cushion in your checking account, linking your checking account to your savings account, and keeping track of spending online, where all of my bank's electronic sales show up more or less instantly.  For these reasons, I use a check card.  

There are reasons for using credit cards that exist beyond living beyond your means.  Most credit cards offer reward points so you can get a ""free"" overstock toaster oven after $5,000 spent, some percentage of cash back (.5 - 2%), charitable donations, or airline miles (1 mile:1 dollar) based on a dollar amount of transactions.  Also, for people with no credit or bad credit, responsible use of credit cards that are frequently backed up by a cash deposit can be an excellent method of building good credit.  I have had my gold card for 7 years this way.

Because most credit card companies let you pay online whenever you want, you can pay by credit card, get the perks, and pay your purchase off instantly by transferring funds without incurring interest.  I'd like to do this someday, but first I have to pay the fuckers off.  Life happened, and thus the US problems with credit cards.   

In another class of payment cards entirely are the physically similar (but likely differently encoded) Electronic Balance Transfer (EBT) cards that many people without bank accounts receive government benefits on.  Shit with microchips inside like they have in Europe don't do much for the end user or at point-of sale because unless they're there to verify biometric data, there's enough data in the magstripe to process the transaction.

While I'm not sure about the methods of which EBT cards connect, all cards could theoretically be swiped by this thing.  Debit is another animal, requiring a PIN entered on the transacation and I think it's phone line based, but really, to a terminal like this it's all software.  

The variety of payment terminals in the US allow for a variety of signature and PIN collection methods, from signing the reciepts and handing you a PIN pad to entirely touch-screen methods.  

Since it's flat out easier to process a transaction as credit and debit sometimes incurs additional fees, most electronic transactions are credit based.  

**tldr**: I use a card that processes to the retailer like a credit card but to me as a check.  The same card does debit from my checking account should I so desire.  Absent software changes in the thingy in the article, it's no problem accepting all forms of electronic payment in the United States.

My wife and I are both 37.  This is our first child.  It wasn't an accident, we decided to have a kid.  Which blew everyone away because for the last... 15 years our plan was simply not to have children.  But now we have a home, and careers, and things have slowed down and we realized that our lives night to night have become routine.  We realized that this is it... as much as we can talk about traveling across Europe, and all the other stuff we talk about doing, but never often get to do (because of money, work, etc) we realized that these were just things we talked about to make our future seem more optimistic then it really was.  

We came to realize that what we were doing, night after night, was basically it... for the next 30 years, this is our life.  It seemed empty, and shallow, and seriously fucking boring.  

We didn't have a big conversation about it, but yet it wasn't spur of the moment.  We finally realized we wanted our lives to be about something other then ourselves, and that we had enough to share with another.

I know at the point you're at right now, this will sound like even more ""sentimental dross"" but yes, you do change when you get older.

By 500 B.C., Chinese and Korean junk boats traded spices; not long thereafter, the Spice Route extended from Europe to Asia and eventually the Americas. While Europe languished during the Dark Ages, Indonesian, Arab, Chinese and Indian traders were busily profiting from their trading empire.

I'm not advocating Spain default, BTW that would make things a lot worse for them.

&gt;Well the government can save doing something else.

Which wasn't my point in the portion you quoted. It's whether the business sector's activity had a negative externality of depressing state revenue.

&gt;What? In whose world? (Perhaps in the US, but in Europe they typically move money from the rich to the poor and build infrastructure)

In this world, including Europe. At the very least that's the socialist line. That's what a ""worker's state"" is supposed to be, to replace the council of capitalists with a council of the proletariat (of course it doesn't really work out that way.) States are large organizations the encourage a concentration of capital by way of protective tariffs, subsidies, bailouts, artificially low interest loans, outlays, etc. War is also a huge cartelizing machine. They may (as with the US Dept of Defense) may try to minimize the effect by requiring a certain level of subcontracting on the part of the primary contractors, but large organizations like states can't help but encourage the concentration of capital that creates the need for these sorts of worker protections.

&gt;The debate - as far as I can tell - is about Spain defaulting.

Well this particular debate, both with the strike and here is how the crisis is being handled. Whether the workers are the ones who have to make sacrifices for the crisis while the same reason is used to reward the group of people who caused the problem in the first place.

&gt;State-run enterprises are notoriously inefficient, but sure, why not.

There have been cases when that isn't the case. Many city-level services are actually revenue sources for their municipality (Chicago's bus system for instance.) One example that Spain could follow would be the [Indianapolis Fleet Service](http://www.dol.gov/_sec/media/reports/worktogether/chp2snap.htm) which (with union help) manage to reorganize the workplace under a gainsharing program to the point where private contractors weren't _able_ to underbid them (and make a profit anyways) similar concepts can be applied to state-ran businesses or the rest of the state apparatus for that matter.

&gt;The problem is that you need money to start those,

Spain has money. Even without defaulting if they just make it clear to prospective lenders that they have a serious and plan to raise revenue (beyond just ""we'll start a few businesses as revenue streams"" I mean) then they can secure lending, supposing they have a problem either securing the funds or securing the credit internally.

&gt;Frankly they should just look at the countries that are doing fine through all of this, and adapt measures from them

Which brings us back to my central point as to why the general strike is necessary, that the neoliberal answer is treated as the _only_ answer. Even when it fails (as in Argentina) those are treated as exceptions, meanwhile examples like this are seen as opportunities to rollback what took much effort and organization to gain in the first place.

That's because feminists and I have different concepts of what represents the good in life. If you have an orthodox liberal view (as most feminists do) that we should aim to be autonomous individuals, then a traditionally feminine role will seem inferior, and its conferral on women will seem unequal and unjust. 

But if you have a non-liberal view, the feminine role loses inferior status; instead, it is a development of the adult female personality in the same way that the masculine role is for men. What is then an injustice is if these goods are unnecessarily denied to either men or women.

You'll notice that Western societies are being pushed steadily along feminist, liberal lines, so that in some European countries life is being structured around state controlled, androgynous working and parenting roles. ",t1_c115633,1285990756,melb22,t5_2qhk3

You seem confused. I hadn't actually given you my definition of ""limited liability."" But since you asked, I'm using the precise definition you'll find in any law school casebook on corporate law. Limited liability means simply that equity shareholders are liable for no more than the value of their equity stake.

Note that, as I said earlier, the liability of a corporation itself is not limited. The corporation itself is fully liable for its actions, and the managers and directors can be held directly liable for malfeasance that they commit on the corporation's behalf.

Anyway, why the fuck anyone thinks it's a good idea to junk limited liability is beyond me. I guess some people just want every U.S. corporation to pack its bags and move to Europe or Canada or something.

But it is their wont to perform sacrifices to Zeus going up to the most lofty of the mountains, and the whole circle of the heavens they call Zeus: and they sacrifice to the Sun and the Moon and the Earth, to Fire and to Water and to the Winds: these are the only gods to whom they have sacrificed ever from the first; but they have learnt also to sacrifice to Aphrodite Urania, having learnt it both from the Assyrians and the Arabians; and the Assyrians call Aphrodite Mylitta, the Arabians Alitta, 13601 and the Persians Mitra.

As has been mentioned in some threads here, there's--for instance-- the other issue of the CIA-backed coup of president Arbenz, which I believe is one of the worst things to have happened to my country. Allow me to explain why with a condensed rundown of events:

* Late 15th century: Spaniards with germs and guns make it to Central America. Having spent centuries practicing brutal combat they easily subdued the natives who, while considered brave warriors with larger armies, were too gullible and ignorant... and had no guns nor antibodies. They quickly became the invaders' bitches, losing their land, their culture, and even their religion.

* 16th to 19th centuries: Europeans and their descendants established a ruling class along with the clergy, keeping the natives as servants and manpower in feudalistic societies with no vote or voice.

* 19th century: Many Latin American feudal states declared their independence from Spain as it became increasingly clear that winds of change were blowing in the motherland: Spain's new constitution limited the power of the monarchy and clergy, and called for social justice. Not good news for overlords in the colonies, who decide to break ties lest they lose their grasp on power. Natives continue to be utterly fucked, living practically as slaves.

* After ""independence"" various violent struggles for power ensued. Naturally the most vicious groups were the ones to grab hold of it. The US played its part in helping two of Guatemala's most brutal dictators rise to power: Estrada Cabrera and Ubico. They gave the US government what it wanted: vast areas of land for the United Fruit Company, the Chiquita Banana people. Their dictatorships were brutal and senseless; many critics were murdered, and oppression prevailed.

* 1944: A straw breaks the camel's back: an army officer kills a teacher, sparking a countrywide strike. Ordinary people take up arms and manage to oust the military rulers. Democratic elections are called for the first time; finally, destitute natives have at least the power to vote.

* 1945: Guatemala's ""ten years of spring"" begin. A civilian intellectual is elected to power: Arévalo, a university professor, who initiated reforms and established institutions with the goal of establishing social justice. He is quickly labelled a communist abroad.

* 1951: Time for elections again. Arbenz is elected, and continues Arévalo's reforms. Things are looking good for everyday Guatemalans. Arbenz begins expropriating land from landowners and foreign companies to distribute to landless peasants. This does not sit well with the United Fruit Co., who call on the CIA for help.

* 1954: Spring comes to an end. Declassified CIA documents now show that their operation PBSUCCESS was deployed to violently overthrow Arbenz. Democracy ends, and a string of dictators follows once again. The country devolves anew into terrible infighting, resulting in a bloody civil war which ostensibly ended in the '90s... but peace has yet to arrive. Currently 16 Guatemalans are violently killed every day, which is a lot for a small country of less than 14 million.

I feel that the CIA coup is one of the lowest points in our history. Did you know that Che Guevara, who had not yet taken arms, was in Guatemala when the CIA coup took place? His then wife wrote: ""It was Guatemala which finally convinced him of the necessity for armed struggle and for taking the initiative against imperialism. By the time he left, he was sure of this.""

While I may not agree with his decision, I certainly can agree with the sentiment. It would piss anybody off. I just hope the current generations do their damnedest to ensure nothing like this happens ever again.

I'm pretty sure you could have found lots of people in Europe in the late 30s who would have thought the same thing.  I can think of a half dozen ways to temporarily blind the US to a large troop movement.  The easiest and most spectacular would be to set off a couple dozen nukes in high orbit simultaneously, frying all the comsats and screwing up the ionosphere, disrupting long range communications.  America's all-seeing overview would be gone, and the usual communication channels would be rendered useless.  Everyone would have to fall back to short range surface radar to spot threats and rely on hardlinks for command and control communications at a fraction of their usual effectiveness.  Of course everyone in the world would freak and know **something** was up, but Invasion USA would be pretty low down on the list.  Everyone would instead be watching for a nuclear strike somewhere.

Another side effect is that shipping goods would become quite a bit cheaper than trucking goods. Port cities would thrive, as trade with Europe and China would be more cost effective than buying goods from Middle America. Of course, that would have a hit on jobs in the middle of the country, further exacerbating the pinch felt by those not in the upper classes.

I got as far as walking with her back to her apartment, where I think I could have swayed her into letting me at least go up and have a drink, and at best have sex with her. But there were two things at hand that made me think I needed to go. 

First, I was already planning on meeting someone. I was late and she was waiting for me; all the while I was walking, I was also exchanging a few txt msgs to say how I was coming soon. This person was an 18 year old girl I met recently and it was a sure thing I'd get to have sex with her. 

Second, this model was annoying. She was hot, leggy, and all that good stuff but she was talking about drinking bellinis in Europe or something shallow like that. We basically had nothing in common. I told her I worked in web development and she immediately said how boring that was (fine, that may be true but how rude and glaring of our uncommonality). Neither of us could really relate to each other, coming from such different backgrounds, and our conversation was pretty dry and very uninteresting. I remember I had gagged a few times to myself thinking how dreadful the conversation was. Although, I also think I remember that she might been older than me by 5 years (maybe, hard to tell). But she was still hot and an international model so... yea, still wanted her but the feelings really dampened my motivation. 

I ultimately told her I had to go and she took down my number and I left. So of course, she never called and now I regret not having sex with a hot international model I picked up completely cold from the street, walking with her back to her apartment where, if things went right, we could have fucked.

If I were smart, I would have told the other girl I couldn't make it and that I'm sorry but will totally 100% make it up to her the next day. Then I could have taken the model as far as I could go and see where I could have gotten. I did think of this but I was afraid the other girl would have gotten pissed off for waiting and didn't want to see me again. So ultimately, my reasoning at the time was this: how often would I get to fuck an 18 year old ever again? Not ever, while maybe (just maybe) I could meet a model again, any age. 

So I actually kind of obsess over this choice and wish I could have done it differently. I'm screwed up in the head, I know. But I still regret it.

In short, it was musical genre born in the late 70s/early 80s characterized by a super-fast tempo and often having anti-establishment lyrics. It was inspired by a variety of genres, from early punk to post-punk to heavy metal to noise rock on the music side, and paired with the counter-culture message from a variety of status quo-defying movements around that era (hippies, black rights, the political mess in the US and Britain).

Hardcore punk was the original ""hardcore"" genre. It served as an influence to just about every genre that was born in the 80s and afterwards. Even within the hardcore movement, there were different ""schools""/scences; that is, a band from hardcore had a very, very different sound from a California band, and a completely different sound when compared to a British band, and these were also different from Swedish bands, and so on. For example, the Boston scene had faster tempos and a more raw sound ([SS Decontrol](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dnLC3RAvA) than California bands (like [Fear](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQM00K24qG8)). Britain's [Amebix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nN4mOUrgbn0) had a very gloomy sound which was present in almost every other British band. [Disorder](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcIWSms1gxI)'s music, as its name implied, was pure disorder. It was almost completely dissonant. Sweden's [Shitlickers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h406z7bS-eg) had the traditional extremely-raw sound of Swedish bands. It was pure and utter (yet beautiful) mess.

Another interesting thing to note was that European hardcore punk bands dealt with anarchism more often than not, and the bands were made by lower-class people; whereas the US punk bands had middle-class kids and the lyrics were not as ""crude"" or direct or harmful towards ""the system"" as their British counterparts.

Metallica was initially (and incorrectly) considered a ""hardcore punk"" band when in its early stages due to the raw speed and sound of their music. Same for Slayer. The entire thrash metal movement borrowed the speed and attitude of the hardcore punk movement and the... **complexity** and gloominess of heavy metal, and fused it all together. Metallica did a cover of Discharge's [""The More I See""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgJDpfm9dcM) ([Metallica version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRZ0TTJbUAA)) and Slayer used to do a live cover of Dead Kennedys' [""Holiday In Cambodia""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KTsXHXMkJA) (though I can't find their version). Similarly, Anthrax was also inspired by the punk movement.

I'll go back to the thrash side in a bit.

Around the mid-80s death metal was created. Again, early proto-death metal bands like [Possessed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6FZBIZ0Xbs) combined the metal sound of thrash and made it even more aggressive, borrowing, once again, from some hardcore punk bands, primarily the bleakness and growling sound of bands like [Discharge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk9v6AM1hUk). Then came actual death metal with bands like [Death](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l79HbNhSnsw) and [Sepultura](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxnVuvywUUQ). Sepultura specifically was heavily inspired by hardcore punk bands, doing a couple of covers and later releasing albums with very noticeable punk elements (1993's Chaos AD).

Incredibly enough, music would get even more extreme with the birth grindcore with bands like [Napalm Death](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esgh_tyH3Uc) and [Terrorizer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjviWgLQLe4), and early crust bands like [Disrupt](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkprusF5la0) [Concrete Sox](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWzbiK9EnFI) (notice the thrash-sounding elements in this song). Around this time black metal was also in the process of creation, which, again, also had some hardcore punk influences. Bathory's debut [Blood Fire Death](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYnstGB3rM) had some crust elements, as well as Darkthrone's [early material](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBwu83RR6ZU). [At The Gates](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF0U77bm9mc) also cited punk bands as influence, the singer went on to create crust punk band [Skitsystem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYg1Qnl-Efo) when ATG disbanded.

Ah, I forgot. Also, around the mid-80s, crossover was born. [DRI](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZfKu_8a9ds), [Suicidal Tendencies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoF_a0-7xVQ), [Corrosion of Conformity](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JF4Nkh0kbNo) and [Poison Idea](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQGn5ZZJ_TQ), to name a few, despite being considered punk bands, borrowed (oddly enough) the cleaner, more straightforward sound of thrash metal and fused it with the punk speed. It was a clusterfuck of different kinds of mixings happening.

Anyway, ""hardcore"" bands of today (like Between the Buried And Me) are not actually ""hardcore"" per se, but are rather given that term incorrectly because they don't fit any of the other genres (though I would still classify them as metalcore). There is no doubt they were influence in more than one way by extreme metal bands of the late 80s/early 90s, but *HARDCORE*, used correctly, refers to hardcore punk.

Also, I really think that if your assumption of being so highly self-educated is coming off as waaay too pretentious.  

How can you quote data and information from places like ""policeofficersteps.com"" and ""policejobsinfo.com"" and assert them to be credible sources?

Your argument is very weak. You point out a few publicized individuals that happen to be highly scrutinized over what amounts to opinions and, therefore, you conclude that since they had an Ivy-League education, then everyone who has an Ivy-league education must be guilty of the same shortcomings.  It's the ""one bad apple ruins the whole bunch"" fallacy.  While I agree that the people you alluded to hold dumb ideological opinions, that in no way is grounds to declare them uneducated or unintelligent.  

Colleges aren't a scam, at least the traditional colleges. The ""university of phoenix"" and other diploma-mills could largely fall under a ""scam"" as you put it.  While it's true college is not for everyone, that does not mean it is only a means to an end.  College, to me, does more than educate in the traditional sense. It's an education in social interaction, networking, financial responsibility, and independence as well.  It's true you don't need to go to college to accomplish all of this either, though. But, a degree is a document that establishes credibility.  In this world, that is the only currency that matters.

You need to be more specific when you state what your ""real world achievements"" are and how they are equal to or greater than what completion of formal education is.  You condemn postsecondary education (and secondary as well, perhaps?) but you offer no evidence to why or how taking the contrary path of not attending college is a no worse exhibition of knowledge or intellect.

And last I checked, if you excel on the testing requirements for Ivy-league and similar schools, then chances of acceptance is higher.  Outside of that, at least obtaining an average or close-to-average score on the ACT/SAT will get you in just about any state university of your choosing.  And those scores are not terribly difficult to get.

Everyone has a right to prove what they know and get a degree in America, buddy. All you have to do is pass the entrance exam.  I do agree with you that the entire spider-web of college loans and grants should be restructured in a way that is puts less of a burden on those who need them, though.

You're also assuming Europe's setup is superior to the US's. Some degree programs in America would be insanely difficult, if not impossible to self-learn.. because it amounts to retention and memorization with the purpose to be able to regurgitate it on an exam. That, in its entirety, is not sufficient to be able to use that education constructively in a practical job setting, imho.",t3_d2o19,1286005421,sethc,t5_2qqdb

I grew up in an extremely abusive household with bikers, loggers, rednecks, etc. I watched momma get beat half to death, and almost to death, growing up.

I'll never forget coming home after a great weekend visiting my Dad and seeing blood all over the house, leading back to the bathroom where I found my momma in the bathtub, with her eyes rolled back in her head, blood coming from them and blood pouring out from her head and mouth and ears.

I was 9 years old when a friend and I stole a bag of weed from my step-dad and tried to smoke it. Of course, we didn't know what to do with it, so we wrapped a rolling paper around a single bud, licked it up and lit it... about 20 minutes later, as I was emerging from the woods by my house, my step-dad is barreling towards me on his Harley.

He literally jumps off the bike, letting it fall down (really nice sporty btw) and proceeded to kick me in the face and balls until I was unconscious.
I peed blood the whole next day and my mom refused to take me to a doctor because they would know I was being abused.

At school, a teacher had a conference with me and my mom after I told her that my face looked like hamburger because I fell down some stairs and my mom warned me before we met with her that if I said anything, CSD would come and take me away and put my mom in jail.

Anyways, at 10 years old I was raped by a family friend's son whose house we were living at (we were homeless). It hurt really bad and made my butthole bleed, but he said that all guys do this, but he wouldn't stop even though I was crying and telling him no... I found out that he died last year after overdosing on methadone and alcohol... I laughed and rejoiced when I found out.

At 11 years old I was raped again by another friend of the family, and he groomed me to think it was ok and that all the other boys were doing it (I know there were others than me...). That lasted until I was 13, He'd drive me around in his car, buy me cigarettes and beer and all that.

I remember the worst thing I ever seen him do was when he took about 5 or 6 week old kittens and put them in a pillowcase, tied it around the muffler of his caddilac and gassed them. He took them out of his pillowcase and stuffed them one by one into the sewage hatch in his front yard. 

I freaked after that. I tried stopping him but he said he would kill me if I ever told and he was a bit older and after seeing that, I believed that he would have killed me.

I started drinking at 15 years old and found that those horrible memories went away, but the side effects were devastating. I would black out and freak out, scream, fight, do crazy shit like draw huge pentagrams in the middle of the street and ""pray to satan""... that side of me lasted until 2008 when I finally woke up one day and said I had enough and I haven't had a drink since then, nor have I craved one. 

I didn't want to leave my house because I was ashamed of being me. I was ashamed of all the things that have happened to me, sad because people knew about it and didn't ever offer to help me. 

At 13 years old, I remember babysitting these kids with my bro John out in Springfield, OR. The neighbors were white trash crack dealers/abusers and I knew something was up with their kids when John and I seen em for the first time. The ""Dad"" (scumfuck piece of shit) told us explicitly to ""NOT"" let them have ANYTHING to drink (seriously, no water, milk, juice, nothing) to which we said fuck that. 

When they came home, they found out we gave them stuff to drink, they took the little boy (about 3 years old) upstairs and were hurting him so bad that I still hear his screams to this day. John and I left that shithole and ran down the road to call our parents and everybody literally told us that ""It's not our problem"" ""we don't get involved"" and the best one ""We don't call the cops on people""... but somebody did and the last I ever heard of those people was they each got 2 years in the state pen. I found out many years later that they were taking a nail clipper to the little boy's manhood and burning him with cigarettes. They were letting pedophiles come over to the house and pay to fuck the kids. Even the little baby.

I still hear that scream... 

I have never been able to hold a job because I can't handle criticism or being talked down to. The only thing that kept me alive through it all was my guitar. I started playing at 12 years old and I'm almost 32 now. I am a musician, a husband and a good friend to those I call my brothers. I got into Linux and Windows a long time ago and that has really helped me focus on something other than that goddamn scream that haunts me... 

Anyways, I got on my Wife's insurance and finally went to see a psychiatrist. I told her everything I am telling you now and started a medication regiment that has helped tremendously (Celexa, Abilify, Gabapentin and Ativan for the panic attacks). 

I told her the name of the guy who raped me through those years and she told me that we need to call the police and turn him in but I am still scared... almost like I'm reverting to that scared little boy, scared of his own shadow. 

I still play guitar, started a popular metalcore band and composed all of the music, but I couldn't take getting up on stage and jumping around anymore because of my back injury so I write Acoustic Adult Contemporary music now and play a lot of WoW. I have 4 80s :)

If you ever even suspect a child being abused, please... Stand the fuck up and make it right.

My wife and I really want to move to Sweden and my life long dream is to play and sing in some of the cafes throughout Europe while living peacefully and healing from the hell that I have had to call my life.

Thanks for this thread and for listening. I've been a lurking redditor for years now... This is my home :)

Mmmm... Denmark and Germany in particular did some pretty sweeping changes due to their economies not working ideally in the 90s and 00s. The big change in Denmark was almost completely dismantling the bureaucracy around hiring &amp; firing *while actually improving the social safety net*. Very clever mix of capitalism and socialism in my opinion, and it's working extremely well.

&gt; I'm not advocating Spain default, BTW that would make things a lot worse for them.

Fundamentally there are 4 ways out of this (or any sort of combination or milder variation of thereof):  
a) Spain slashes government expenses  
b) Spain increases taxation to get more revenue  
c) Spain gets more loans with promises to reform themselves (this kind of is a delayed version of A or B)  
d) Spain defaults  

I guess you're implying that some sort of Hitlerian public works program? (I'm not using this in a negative way, there was a very good reason Hitler was very popular early on)

&gt; In this world, including Europe. At the very least that's the socialist line. That's what a ""worker's state"" is supposed to be, to replace the council of capitalists with a council of the proletariat

Definitely not the way the only successful quasi-socialist states roll. Basically there's a great deal of wealth transfer from the wealthy to the poor, but beyond that *everyone* wealthy knows that the way to create money is to allow the capitalist system work while policing its excesses. This means generally rolling with the punches of the system, and then punching back once you're back on your feet (US seems to be doing this latter part quite poorly for example).

&gt; There have been cases when that isn't the case. 

Yes of course, tons. Most of Finlands government companies made profits for very long times. Problem was that it never lasted, and because of the way government worked, they successfully hid 10+ years in a typical case before something was done, often burning away every bit of profit they ever had made. So even if they can work in the short them, our experience implies that they generally don't work in the long term.

&gt; Which brings us back to my central point as to why the general strike is necessary, that the neoliberal answer is treated as the only answer.

Because it has worked so damn well in so many places. Also, few places are *purist* neoliberal - think how much the Nordic Countries, South Korea etc meddle with the economy. Still, there haven't been any comparable successes using any other model among developed countries (France perhaps, but it'd be more or less the only one).",t1_c1158za,1286008430,Delheru,t5_2cneq

This is not about the first Western European. For every Western European, this ""Most Recent Common Ancestor"" is just one out of thousands (or millions?) of ancestors that were alive at that time. Just like TheLivingEnd explained, as you go back in time, the number of ancestors increases exponentially, so at some point in time it just becomes very unlikely that the ancestries don't overlap.  

As to your second paragraph, the wiki article states:

&gt;An explanation of this result is that, while humanity's MRCA was indeed a Paleolithic individual up to early modern times, the European explorers  of the 16th and 17th centuries would have fathered enough offspring so that some ""mainland"" ancestry by today pervades even remote habitats.

Beyond that, I would say it's really a matter of how self sufficient you think (read *know* you can be and what backup plans can be arranged. Would you be going to school in Europe? If you stayed in Aus and things weren't working out, would you be able to fly to Europe to meet them? Where would you live while they were gone etc. etc.

With the self sufficiency aspect if living more or less on your own), that refers to things spanning from transport &amp; food to working out a plumber when your toilet starts leaking. I live in Australia myself and I know these things are relatively easy to come across, but it still takes effort and knowledge that you may not have. Well, for starters I'm assuming you will be 15/16 so you will be at the best on your Learners in terms of driving, but will have a bank account with card and depending on the bank this can be a Visa from the age of 16.

Now for the other side of the spectrum, going with them will likely be a GREAT experience, if you get to go to school over there you will have many experience you won't have here, probably learn another language. Your grades may suffer a bit but as I said, experience. If you don't go to school there, then it will all be waiting when you get back (I'm not sure how it works for gap year type things in high school, but you pretty much need to finish year 10 so they would have something in place). I know this means leaving friends behind and so forth, but they will know you're going and they will know when you come back, so they will still be here.

I'll pull up now as I know I'm rambling a bit, but basically just have a think about the pros and cons/whether your preferred option is possible given circumstances. It's over a year away, plenty could change in terms of circumstance too.

1426496793,,,c115t25,0,0,t1_c115t25,True,t3_dlo60,0,3,False,False,Economics,,3,"There's actually extensive literature on the topic of the money multiplier and why it is not applicable. Post Keynesians have been talking about this for almost three decades.

Charles Goodhart states the following on the money multiplier (he also argues against the MM in his 1989 book):

&gt;“...simple observation of the way that central banks and money markets actually behaved would reveal that this was the exact reversal of the truth. The process started with the Central Bank determining its official short-term interest rate, in pursuit of its current policy objectives. The demand for bank borrowing, at the chosen policy rate, was the main determinate of the growth of monetary aggregates. Given M, **the multiplier worked effectively in reserves, to determine the amount of base money that the authorities had to make available to the banking system to sustain their initially chosen interest rate”** (Goodhart, 2004, p.3)

This is supported by such statements as the following (this is a representation of central bank behaviours in other countries as well):

&gt;”The Reserve Bank has no prescribed target for the level of settlement balances [reserves], supplying whatever amount is needed to keep the cash rate near the target (RBA, 2003, p.4)

Furthermore a previous Reserve Bank Governor stated the following during the 1980s:

&gt;”When the dust has settled and statistics collected, it will be seen that there is a reasonable relationship between the cash base ... and bank deposits. IT is this relationship that has traditionally been referred to as the multiplier between money base and money supply, but as the forgoing suggests, causality between the two variables is a complicated process and not a mechanical one, as estimated equations for the multiplier would imply. **The main channel of causality runs from interest rate to deposit growth and then cash or bank reserves**. The multiplier shows a simple supply relationship but that is because it leaves out the chain of causality” (Macfarlane, 1984, p.116)

Of course we can arrive at the conclusion by other ways as well:
If the central bank is the monopoly issuer of reserves,
Then it can either set the price or the quantity of reserves but not both.
We know that the central bank sets the price, therefore it must allow the quantity of reserves to ‘float’. 

Central banks in maintaining their target rate will actively defend their price and accommodate the demand for reserves, because otherwise transactions to and from the treasury (which destroys reserves and creates reserves, respectively) and banks being interest rate inelastic will cause overnight rates to be volatile, driving it up or down depending on the reserve position of the banking system.

Furthermore all banks do when they create a loan is create bank credit, which is convertible into state money (currency, reserves). Banks don’t need deposits prior to making a loan because loans create deposits as a matter of accounting – deposits exist either from government spending or from private sector credit creation, you can’t have a financial asset (deposit) without a financial liability (which had to have created the financial asset). When a bank creates a loan a simultaneous deposit is created as a matter of accounting. Reserves are sought after the fact (and are not an ex ante operational constraint) to meet reserve requirements (where applicable, this just reduces bank profitability) and as a means of settlement within the banking system.

I’ve read people argue that the money multiplier should be better thought of as a capital multiplier. As banks do require bank capital- ex ante operationally constrained – prior to making a loan, as they assign capital to ‘risky’ assets. 

At the end of the day the money multiplier is simply an ex post accounting identity. You cannot derive causation from an accounting identity, this require ‘theorising’ which interprets the identity and suggests a possible causation. Orthodox economics interpret the identity as implying that causation goes from reserves to deposits to loans. Whereas Heterodox schools (i.e. Post Keynesians) interpret it as a meaningless ratio with little to no use for economic analysis. 

In terms of links (I can search for academic references too, but I’m busy with an econometrics assignment):

Unlike in the US where if you're a top American football player, you play in the NFL and have no other choice about it, with soccer, if you don't like the conditions in one top league then there are many others to choose from. If The English Premier League put a salary cap in place, it's top players will just go somewhere else in Europe that will pay them more. The world governing body of soccer (FIFA) doesn't have enough jurisdiction over all the leagues to enforce a global salary cap. And is such a greedy organisation that it probably wouldn't even if it could. Uafa, the European football body (where the world's richest leagues are) also doesn't have enough jurisdiction, but what they can do is say to each European club, if you want to qualify for the europa league or the champion's league, you need to abide buy our rules. So Uafa's current approach which will be in place in the next couple of years is to say you can't spend what you haven't earned so rich owners can't throw their own money at new players thus destabilising the leagues (which is what we're seeing with the likes of man city and previously Chelsea). The rich owner can spend his own money on infrastructure though so he could improve the training ground etc. This method is *supposedly* more fool proof than a salary cap as clubs can get round salary caps by giving massive non cash based presents to a player and their families such as new houses etc. Plus investing in infrastructure is better for future stability than throwing cash or presents at players",t1_c11504j,1286014040,cloud4197,t5_2qi58

No, everything we know about energy companies suggests that they are fairly rational actors who will build whatever's cheapest for them to create/run and will throw off the most profit, given whatever regulatory regime they're working under.  No power co. is going to bloody-mindedly build nuclear, coal, diesel, solar, wind, whatever, for the sheer principle of it (well, with some of the European renewables-oriented ones, they do just that, because that is a selling point for customers.)

I don't care where my power comes from, as long as it's clean and inexpensive.

Insurance  is supposed to cover you for unforeseen (maybe catastrophic) events. Health care is a service, and like any other service it has a price. But since usually the insured don't pay for their service, medical providers charge the maximum that insurance is willing to cover (and beyond, so there's still some out of pocket for the patient). The prices aren't subject to supply and demand but to the providers ability to extract as much money allotted by the plan as possible. The result is a spiral of inflation in health care costs.

That would sound plausible, but:  In Poland, Czechia, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Sweden and lots and lots of other countries, ""usually the insured don't pay for their service""; actually, this phenomenon is way more pronounced there because of universal health care paid by the state.  Following your logic, they would also face the same high costs -- but they don't.  

I think a main point is leverage by monopoly.  When the state threatens to drop your drug off their coverage plan (they can do that), you go back and re-negotiate the price.  Another point is that the EU banned ads for prescription drugs.  The drug companies can't advertise -- but one can also say that they don't have to advertise, so a **major** cost factor for them is just not apparent in the EU.  

In fact, the US patient pays on average more of his health care costs personally than in any other state the professor uses.  

&gt; Our poor health is one of the problems.

As the article mentions, there are strong indications that obesity is **not** the main driver.  It shortens lives, but obesity patients are relatively cheap (they die before they become really costly..).  ",t1_c114paq,1286018760,kolm,t5_2qyt6

The second and third options are both insurance, and as such won't solve the fundamental problem. Nations that use these solutions don't see their costs go down, they just hide them through complicated budgetary schemes and rationing.

This is flat out wrong, and if dogma conflicts with reality, it does not help to re-iterate the dogma, reality won't go away.  If the EU had higher actual health care costs than the US, we would be bankrupt.  The OECD does a really good job at assessing the actual health care costs, and the article shows that their findings are precisely the opposite of your claim.  Also, rationing occurs in the sense that they won't pay for bullshit like homeopathy, but if your life is at stake, you will get **every** treatment that the doctors approve and which could save you, regardless of costs.  They pump south of $200 000 worth of drugs into every relapsed leukemia kid, regardless of the poor response rate (less than 5% survivors after relapse).

On another note you have to prove that states without these regulation are facing an epidemic of serious problems from not having these regulations. Maybe the private market is only screwing up in one out of a thousand cases and their screw ups get fixed quickly. You have provided no evidence society is truly better off for these particular laws. Excessive regulation can make the average citizens life worse off as a whole because businesses flee the state.

Government interference in markets is what caused the huge catastrophic housing bubble we just had. The Government went from owning very little mortgages in the 1980s to owning 56%  of the mortage market in the US. It is no coincidence we then had a housing bubble that was 400% bigger than anything we had ever seen before. The United States and Spain had aggresive home ownership policies and both had huge housing bubbles. Germany had a different strategy and no housing bubble.

Spanish banks were heavily regulated but that didn't stop a huge housing bubble there either. Spain also had been artificially stimulating housing for years with pro home ownership policies.

Fannie Mae also acted as a world player in stimulating housing because it was such a big share of the world market others had to loosen standards to compete. Fannie Mae dropped Mortgage interest rates by about 1% in America and that had a world wide effect. Just so you know the Value of the $6 trillion in mortgages owned by Fannie is equal to the entire Chinese mortgage market four times over. The entire Chinese mortgage market is valued at $1.6 trillion so Fannie Mae played a larger role in influencing mortgage prices than China, India, the rest of Asia, and sections of Europe combined.

I'm saying that you live in a society which has systems and rules in place. You can either leave, or try to change those rules. It's neither here nor there.

&gt; It seems that whoever we vote into office will continue on the same path of taxation and war.

A government has to be paid for. Without going into a deeper debate about the pros and cons of libertarianism - if we assume we have a government, and that government is elected, and has policies and systems in place that people on the whole support, then the money to run it has to come from somewhere - i.e. taxes.

&gt; It doesn't matter if it is debilitating or not. It does not matter that you reduce the amount of poor or not. No one is going to argue that they don't want to reduce, or even abolish, poverty. However I will not accept the price of individual freedom and autonomy for that goal.

Then don't think of it as bankrolling layabouts - think of it as insurance in case you fall into the same situation they're in.

&gt; We are forced to give up about 40% of what we earn to the government and there is still poverty. There is still unemployment. There is still crime. There is still ill-health. 

All of those things increase when poverty rises. No system is perfect - and every system has its problems and people who exploit others.

&gt; If helping the poor is something people want to do then they will do it.

Except they don't. People make a lot of noise about helping the poor - but again, if people actually walked the walk instead of just talking the talk, the world would have no hunger or poverty.

&gt; 1) Person A has a noble goal. 2) Person A requires $43,535 to achieve noble goal. 3) Person A does not have $43,535.
Your conclusion is that Person A go to Person B,C,D and force them to pony up the $43,535. My conclusion is that Person A go to Person B,C,D and ask them to donate the money. If Persons B,C,D agree that the goal is indeed noble then they will co-operate. If they don't...well that is their choice. Why should they work for the sake of Person A's goals?

This is, I think, a fundamental difference between the USA (we're you seem to be from) and the UK / Europe (Where I am). From my (admittedly limited) experience of Americans, they seem to be very hostile to collectivism, working together, and pretty much any socialistic system. I happily pay tax to fund the welfare state, and I don't see it as 'paying for others'. I see it as a worthwhile investment in the society I live in, as well as insurance for myself and my friends and family.

If I'm not mistaken, it was the Egytians themselves who refined this into the light, maneuverable weaponsystem that we are more familiar with. As to the possible abandonment of the horse and chariot by the hebrews. The early greeks, prior to, and during their migration into the med. area were horse nomads (according to some sources), but the use of the horse was more or less abandoned as the peninsula was not really ideal horse country. We also have the example of the chinese abandoning maritime technology, by official decree. given all this, I still think that a Hyksos - Hebiru connection is doubtful.

Egyptian slavery: this was more or less a labor levy. As you said, a good way to occupy the populace during idle times and to get a few things done. A more modern example may be the Janissaries of the Ottoman Sultans, or even the Mamelukes in Egypt itself. In many culture slavery was ian institution that one could voluntarily enter into, and in some cases could lead to high office.

Regarding the bible (actually at this point we are talking about what is known now as the torah) I've come acros some interesting theories concerning this. at the time of it's ""rediscovery"" the jewish nation went through an intense social restructuring, foreign influences were proscribed (violently at times) not only in religion and government, but even into the family structure. Foreign spouses were supposedly ""put out"". According to this theory the holy-books were ""found"" in the temple and used to justify the draconian methods used to ""purify"" the kingdom. Sources are hard to find.

As to proscribed archeological research: investigations into the Kazar Empire around the Caspian Sea are not exactly encouraged. There is evidence that this is the homeland of the Ashkenazic line of the Jewish peoples. I say this as a Magyar whose ancestors were once allied with the Khazar, and, after leaving the Caspian Sea area, rode into europe accompanied bythe first independent jewish cavalry (the Khabar) to be seen in europe. Once again, an interesting theory.

First of all I think a 5mm wet-suit is **enough** if you are planning to do 1 - 2 dives per day.

Secondly it depends where exactly you are going to stay, for someone to tell you about good diving sites.

Generally speaking the southern Crete is far more unspoiled and you can see many things. Though it is getting deep soon enough and you are going to get many wall dives.

On the northern side of the island there many famous spots to visit:

* On the Agios Nikolaos area, there are good diving sites near Ellounda. A diving center that can get you there it is the [Crete Underwater Center](http://www.creteunderwatercenter.com).
* On the Heraklion area, you can visit the dive site Mononaftis, or the Stavros Cave with the help of the dive center [European Diving Institute](http://www.eurodiving.net).
* On Rethymnon area you can visit the Elephants Cave (where you can find the fossils of the teeth of a mammoth) with the help of the [Paradise Dive Center](http://www.diving-center.gr/).
* Lastly if you are in the Chania area, you can dive the nice spots in the Chania Bay near Kolymvari, and a good dive center is [Fun Dive](mailto:fundivegreece@hotmail.com).

In the past people who I have lived with from the States and Europe, do have some ethics that are almost universal when living together. They are subtle but they are there.

I expect there will be more cases like this because of the economy, but I don't expect my friends to bullshit me when generally they know I can get over everything if it is brought up. 

You are right in a way about the GF and he probably shares more with her than I care to see. Especially as I saw some of his good qualities and none of hers.

You need to make yourself happy before you can make your ex-girl happy.  You can't worry about her.  You don't NEED her.  You don't.  You need yourself, and you only want to surround yourself with people who appreciate YOU for you. 

EVERYONE makes mistakes.  If you can recognize these mistakes (by talking out your problems with a therapist, or if you want, us) then you can learn how to avoid them in the future.  Sometimes, we find out that WE aren't even the ones who made mistakes, it's that others screwed up and we only blame ourselves.  Regardless, there is always a chance to move on.  The fact that you came to others for help says alot about your potential for hope, and hope is all you need.

From what I read in your post, you are viewing your life ONLY through your relationships with others.  That's not the way to do it.  The world is so much bigger than that.  You mentioned some things you still want to do: go to europe, go to the East Coast.  So go, and keep a journal.  And tell us about it.  

Are there going to be people that might try to say hurtful things to you?  Sure, but it's a small minority.  They are anonymous, and in real life are probably just very young and inexperienced people--so take it with a grain of salt.  They will learn life soon enough.  

But you should go to Europe, or at least to the East Coast.  Just follow your heart and gain some experiences.  Maybe you'll decide you don't want to go back.  Maybe you will, but you'll be a stronger person.

You can't take back mistakes (debt, stabbing people in the back--if you really did, personally, i think maybe YOU were the one who was taken advantage of).  But you can continue to live without making those same mistakes again.  For your debt, it means that you took from society more than you contributed.  Now, I know the system isn't perfect, and who knows what your story is (maybe you were taken advantage of, or maybe you weren't and it was a gambling problem or just a bad investment or whatever)  But anyway, when you get your shit together, just start contributing to society.  If you need ideas on how, then ask us.  But you need to get yourself together first.  You can't help others if you can't help yourself.  That's why you may feel like people are leaving you recently. No one can really make you comfortable and happy.  That's a huge responsibility to ask of someone else.  You need to do that yourself.  And then others will be more likely to get close to you, because people often have a hard enough time keeping themselves together, let alone be the sole point of happiness for someone else.  

Anyway, keep in touch.  Don't ever try to take the easy way out.  The world isn't perfect, but if everyone just gives up when it doesn't go their way, then it will never be fixed. 

Finally, broaden you mind.  There is alot more beauty to the world than you are giving it credit for.  Explore what is out there in nature and everything else.  Read.  

Read, do what makes you happy, and laugh. laugh laugh laugh laugh laugh.

Best of luck to you.  And remember: it will all work out...it has to.

But I do not think that is a useful definition for the term.  A Christian nation, in my view, is a country with an official state church, as with any number of European countries.  Obviously under the definition I am considering the United States is not a Christian nation.  

However as I said before, the most important thing is not the religious convictions of the Founding Fathers, but the documents they produced outlining the operation of their new nation.  Those documents created a government that is separate from religion, so even though many of the Founders were Christians, they created a secular, western nation.

It is clear that libertarianism is the correct way and that nothing short of full privatisation will fullfill that vision.

&gt;There's the fundamental problem that space is limited, and thus roads are non-compete-able industries. 

Everything is compete-able. The fact there is too little supply for demand shows the government has failed to run the roads correctly.

&gt;for example, say some company buys the road infront of my house, and since they don't like me (I slept with the owner's daughter and dumped her) then decides to charge $200 every time I cross it

This could happen in any industry. The obvious solution would be to sell the road directly to you.

&gt;There is no space for a competitor to make a new road and charge a lower price. 

Trains are privately run and yet there is not additional train tracks run by a competitor.

The US has a really screwed up system, with toothless regulation, corruption and cronyism.

Look at Germany, or Canada, and you see governments that do more and are less corrupt. What we need isn't less government, what we need is less corrupt and ineffectual government.

I don't really agree with. Our(world) internet does not only encompass the US and Europe. China and India and other poorer countries are coming into the fold. Not every one over there can afford the best latest greatest machines. They get a lot of their computers from us(our older computers) and other countries like Japan. Those computers are 3 to 10 years old. All of which are probably not even capable of running IE 6.0. The ones that do get internet access will be capable of it and that will raise the stats for IE 6.0. Then consider on a smaller scale the Small us business's.. That don't really need the best latest greatest computers and usually just buy a used computer and they don't have a ton of experience with it and just leave whatever browser is on it when they get it.

I carry a photocopy of my Irish passport with me so that when they start asking me questions at customs I can just hand them the photocopy and cut the interview short.  I was once held up at customs in Ireland for several hours due to giving vague answers about my plans.

Sort of like this:

Q:  How long do you plan on staying?
A: Dunno, a few months most likely.

Q: Where will you be staying while you are in Ireland?
A: Not sure, I'll probably head to one of my Aunts houses and see what happens from there..

They didn't like that until they realized I am an Irish citizen and then the tone changed immediately.  That was when it was suggested to me that I carry a photocopy of my Irish passport and present it when I land.  

I know other guys who take off on one passport and land on another.  None of them have ever had problems doing that.. If I am traveling in Europe I usually look at which line is shortest at customs.  If it's the EU only one I go there, if it's not I take out the US one.",t1_c116pa6,1286046196,[deleted],t5_2qzb6

From the article -

' 'Early Palestinians’, eh? And just who were these ‘early Palestinians’? Well, they were what we would otherwise call... Jews. ...

' ...

' Much of this rewriting of history comes from Arab Christians based at the Sabeel Ecumenical Liberation Theology Centre in Jerusalem under the aegis of Father Naim Ateek ... which is a crucial source of systematic, theologically-based lies and libels about Israel. ...

' Ateek has sought to plant the impression that the Jews are crucifying the ‘Palestinians’ just as they helped crucify Jesus. In December 2000, he wrote that Palestinian Christmas celebrations were ‘marred by the destructive powers of the modern-day ‘Herods’ in the Israeli government.’ In his 2001 Easter message, he wrote: ‘The Israeli government crucifixion system is operating daily. Palestine has become the place of the skull.’ And, in a sermon in February 2001, he likened the Israeli occupation to the boulder sealing Christ’s tomb. With these three images, Ateek has figuratively blamed Israel for trying to kill the infant Jesus, crucifying him and blocking the resurrection of Christ. And in 2005 Sabeel issued a liturgy titled ‘The Contemporary Stations of the Cross’ that equates Israel’s founding with Jesus’ death sentence and the construction of a security barrier with his crucifixion.

Notes:


&gt;  ""In California, there's a cult known as surfers. And, some of you might know about surfers, a lot of you might have missed out on this part of your social history. Surfers are young people with bleach-blond hair and they have a sun tan -- you don't know what that is here -- and they have cut-off pants which makes them look sort of funky and authentic and nature-boy style. And they have rubber sandals called Birachies. And they have these things called surf boards which are made out wood and fiberglass, gayly painted. And of course they have the Woolly Wagon, which is an old station-wagon with wood panelling on the side, or if you're too cheap, you paint wooden panelling on the side. And you live this life where you like to go to the beach all the time, even if its freezing cold, jump out there and flop around in the water, and then swim out with your surf board and ride in on the waves. It's very thrilling and it gets you a lot of pussy with the surfer girls. And similar mating practices exist in all walks of life. Truck drivers have certain things they do to get laid. Newspaper writers. They all have their own little thing and there's girls that go along with each one of these stupid games. They're all broken down into little pockets of resistance. Anyway, we have these surfers and they have this curious thing called the Brown Out, which is part of their culture. Now, the Brown Out is the thing that you do to impress your surfer friends and to make other people's eyebrows go up and down. And what you do is you get the other person's attention -- you wave at them or you say something amusing -- and they turn around and look at you and then suddenly you reverse your position, drop your pants, and stick your buns out at them. That is a Brown Out. Also known as a Brown. And also known as Mooning on the East Coast. There are a number of variations on this procedure. If you Brown Out against a wire screen, its called a chipped beef. And if you do it against a plate glass window at a delicatessen, its called a pressed ham.

&gt;  Last year, before we did our Festival Hall show, we arrived at the airport and were provided with a touring bus with nice big windows so that everybody on the outside could see in and we could see out. The lovely ride from the airport to the Winton Hotel. During this trip, a wager was made between Jimmy Carl Black, the Indian of the group, and Bunk Gardner, our silver-haired tenor saxophone virtuoso. Jimmy Carl Black turned to Bunk Gardner and said ""I'll bet you a pound you won't Brown Out on this here bus."" Bunk Gardner, being the crafty silver-haired devil that he is, quickly computed the difference between a pound and a dollar and had his pants off before anybody knew what was happening.

This is an inferior kind of music designed for audiences who can't stand to just listen to music, but need pictures. It was invented here in Europe a long time ago. The first part of the piece has the simulated effect of London traffic. We do this ingeniously by using actual horns which you squeeze with your hand, that go ""oo-bah."" The next thing that happens in the piece is a jolly little theme which gives the impression that the Mothers Of Invention love to go around the country-side in a bus with big windows. Followed by another abstruse-type section that simulates the conversation on the bus, the calculation of the monetary difference, and this leads up to a throbbing, and otherwise surging climax, wherein the pants come off and the buns are revealed. Followed by some low-grade rocking out and instrumental improvisation for about the next 20 minutes or something.""

Backstory: My grandfather was in the Army and landed on Normandy in the second wave. By the time he was done in Europe, he had two purple hearts and a bronze star. While recovering from Purple Heart no. 2, he was doing a desk job in DC. Then, he was transferred to active duty again and was part of the Battle of the Bulge. He brought back his medals, uniform and sidearm. When my dad was young, he found the 1911 in the attic, which prompted its move to somewhere out of the curious hands of children. I suspect he knows where it is, I know my grandma KNEW where it is, but now has Alzheimers and is 95. I think the only reason it hasn't been given to me is because my dad married my mom. Her dad was on Normandy and was a doctor and medic. He came home from the war, started a successful medical practice, had my mom with my grandma, started an entire hospital with some friends, and one day, out of the blue, went to the top of his medical practice and shot himself in the head. She hates guns with an undeniable passion because of it and when she learned i shot a shotgun at boy scout camp, refused to talk to me for about a week. I just really hope he tells me where it is before it disappears into time.

Not being Californian, I don't know all the minutia of state of politics, so I am sure there are many things to object to in his administration, but overall as a national figure he's done far more good than harm. I wish more American politicians were as pleasantly surprising in this way. Contrast this with the disfiguring disappointment of John McCain's craven and cowardly evolution. McCain was much more reasonable 10 - 15 years ago, but has since morphed into the callow creature we know today (although, he was never a saint - research his first wife and how he went about conspiring to achieve his senate seat).",t3_dlxqu,1286052252,[deleted],t5_2cneq

That doesn't mean someone who isn't anti-Semitic has an obligation to never criticize Israel when they commit war crimes or violate human rights violations.

I for one have several problems with modern Israel: I do not approve of the way it came into being (largely European influences creating it), I am absolutely against the way Palestinians have been treated, and I think that Israel violates human rights on a regular basis.

Well, first of all, the law's a bit of a relic; if they were to remake it, they'd probably opt for something more flexible, like obligating every employer to provide their employees with at least one day off - this, as already mentioned somewhere else - is already sorta the case with restaurants and whatnot.    

Anyway, being European, I don't believe in the free market's infallibility. The problem with ""cutting the working poor's hours"" is, if anything, an argument FOR higher minimum wages or similar legislative measures - which have been part of European labor law for a while and are only now being axed one by one - but allowing them to work themselves to death really isn't a solution. Yes, they could earn more if they had another day for work (although it is debatable whether removing restriction such as the one we're talking about would actually create more jobs or if it would simply lead to workers working more for the same wage) but I don't consider ""create more low-paying jobs"" a solution for poverty.

In our current day and age I see no reason for this (except lawyery crap) and as long as this is the case and I'm artificially banned from content I won't buy stuff.

Games/Apps: As long as you insist on stupid DRM stuff I'll pirate. This includes forced Steam or Activation (SC2, Civ5, ...). I regularly buy Indie games or other games without DRM.

I've never pirated an Android App but I've bought quite a few. Why? The experience is quite enjoyable and quick and I like giving the author money. I'd love to do the same again for music, games and movies (I have hundreds of CDs).

Basically: As long as I'm treated as a criminal when buying something online I won't do it. And as long as companies invest massive amounts of money in fighting that which fills the gaps they've left open instead of working on their business model I will continue my current strategy. It's not as if I'm not willing to pay. I currently pay 30 US dollars a month for an Usenet account and I'd be more than willing to spend that elsewhere.

I think the companies will have to react soon. A whole generation of people will grow up learning that this kind of stuff (pirating) is pretty much accepted behavior in our society and that will be much harder to change later on.",t3_dlygh,1286057512,_dodger_,t5_2qh1i

Western socitety is evolving from capitalsim to communism. Why is this too difficult for some people to understand?

We are technologically at the right point. We have a platform for instant communication with anyone, anywhere in the world, which is required for direct democracy on a large scale.

This is the first step towards communism - the dictatorship of the proletariat.

We'll be able to take the next step when we have Star Trek style replicators, and abolish the class divide. Such a technology will allow poeple to create designs on their computers, share them instantly with anyone, anywhere in the world, who can then have them physically produced (replicated).

Within a century,  you'll be able to torrent physical objects. This would mean an end to world hunger and poverty. The only possible type of currency I can think of is energy.

So, would it be immoral for a starving child to replicate some food?
Should it be illegal? Should it be considered theft?

What the copyright lobbyists are trying to do, is set precedents that will make the answers to these questions, ""Yes"". They are trying to hold back the evolution of our societies. Over the next couple of decades though, we'll see Europe and hopefully the US, switch to direct democracy. The internet hasn't really impacted politics yet, but you know it's just a matter of time.

Even once ITER works, it is incredibly expensive. I'd love to see if happen, but I think we are probably 50 years away from commercial deployments.

Have you heard of [molten salt reactors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten_salt_reactor) (also known as [liquid fluoride thorium reactors](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWUeBSoEnRk)) or small modular reactors like Babcock &amp; Wilcox's [mPower](http://www.babcock.com/products/modular_nuclear) or [Hyperion](http://www.hyperionpowergeneration.com/)? If not, read the links. These are the technologies that are going to be ready very soon to replace coal.

As for renewables, they do not have the energy density necessary to even come close to being a practical reality for running the whole grid, especially if we try to use it to charge electric cars and heat homes. They also only work when the wind conditions are right. The result is that they have a low [capacity factor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor), which is the actual average power output divided by the peak power output. Nuclear reactors have a capacity factor above 90% while wind is 20-40%, depending on the location. This means that a 2 MW wind turbine will only output about 400 to 800 kW, which is tiny compared to the 1 GW (1 million kW) each nuclear reactor can put out. 

To understand just how bad this is, let's take a look at the world's largest wind farm. It is called the [Roscoe Wind Farm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscoe_Wind_Farm) and is located in Roscoe, Texas. It has 781.5 MW of installed capacity, cost more than $1 billion, and covers 100,000 acres. At 20-40% capacity factor, that will average 156.3 to 312.6 MW. Over the course of a year, this will output 1.37 TWh to 2.74 TWh of energy.

The United States total energy usage is illustrated here in this diagram from Lawrence Livermore National Lab (https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/energy/content/energy/energy_archive/energy_flow_2008/LLNL_US_EFC_20081.png). Total energy usage in the US is 99.2 quads per year (note: A quad is a [quadrillion BTU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quad_%28energy%29) or 293,071,000,000 Kilowatt-hours). That means we need 29,072,643,200,000 kWh or 29 petawatt-hours.

Let's do some simple math here to estimate how many Roscoe Wind Farms it would take to output 29 PWh. That is 10,584 (for 40% cf) to 21,168 (for 20% cf) copies of the Roscoe Wind Farm. At 100,000 acres or 156.25 square miles a pop, we would need 1,653,750 to 3,307,500 square miles. To put that into perspective, the lower 48 United States entire land mass is 3,119,884.69 square miles.

Essentially, **we would have to completely cover the US with wind turbines to replace our current usage of energy**. Each one of those wind turbines is about 40 stories tall and made of steel and needs exotic materials like neodymium for the generator. A project of such scale would not be good for the environment because of all of the mining and manufacturing and land use involved.

To compare, a big nuclear reactor, like the European Pressurized Reactor, can generate 1,650 MW. At a 90% capacity factor, that is 1,485 MW. Each year, that will generate 13,008,600 MWh or 13 TWh. Therefore, to replace 29 PW of energy, we would need 2,231 EPRs. Let's assume we follow the Japanese example and put a lot of them at a single site. They have a plant with [7 reactors at one site](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashiwazaki-Kariwa_Nuclear_Power_Plant) sitting on 4.2 square kilometers or 1.62 square miles. If we put 7 EPRs per plant, then would need 319 such plants to power the US and it would only need 516.78 square miles. [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=516+square+miles) says that is **about half of the size of Rhode Island**.

This is why we need to use fission if we want to replace coal. Wind just won't work. If we try to skip fission, we will just keep using coal. This is why the French have been able to basically [get rid of coal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_france), while the Germans and the Danish, who push wind, are still getting most of their energy from fossil fuels. Hell, the Germans are planning on building [26 new coal plants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_in_Germany#Electricity) because wind isn't adequate and they have disallowed building new nuke plants.",t1_c1177gv,1286059882,ElectricRebel,t5_2qh1i

However, it is almost impossible to do a proper comparison.  Worse, in a discussion like this one, the argument usually comes down to the fact that none of the private entities that compete with the public ones are in a sufficiently free market...  Of course if you can point out a more efficient fully free market health system then go for it.

&gt;As for defense research, I've worked in defense research and its an unbelievable boondoggle. You should watch this movie.

That would be US defence procurement.  It isn't the same everywhere, especially in places where research is largely public (and so some of the corrupting elements, although not all are minimized).

&gt;Your claim was about efficiency.

As I said, efficiency is about input and output, just being cheaper doesn't make something more efficient, it also has to be effective and fit for purpose.

&gt;Obviously there is some role for taxation, but by agreeing that cuts are bad

Firstly, you need to re-read what I wrote. I didn't say 'cuts are bad' I said that some of the current planned cuts (the ones we know about) and some of the proposed cuts (the ones we are speculating about) are bad.  Things like binning the OFT or the SIA are pretty nasty if they come to pass and we are hearing that from the security sector (that the SIA regulates) and customer groups (that the OFT serves...).  There are more difficult ones to discuss, because they are complex areas, but again, I think that many of the cuts being discussed are simply incorrect moves at present and potentially damaging.


&gt;you are implying that in the UK current taxation is either just right, or too low. How do you defend that argument?

I would say that given that we are trying to cut a deficit we certainly should look at increasing taxation in some areas and changing the balance between cuts and tax increases.  We should certainly be looking to cover both the long term debt and shot term liabilities from the bail outs from the industry that required it (after all, half-year results from Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, Northern Rock, Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered are all positive and up now) to reduce the harm to those who 'invested' in the sector to save it.

I'm pretty sure i put that in there for a reason. Maybe so someone might read it. Oh well. 

&gt;How dare you say that religious people do nothing!!

No i think i will. I worked in a catholic orphanage in the poorest part of south africa. I watched children dying of AIDs, i watched the extreme poverty stagnate the lives of everyone caught in that region

I watched the money come in from overseas catholics being spent on expensive toys the children did not need, on paying camera men to come over and film the pile of clothes religious donaters had demanded thier money be spent on. It wasnt malicious they just hadnt understood the situation, so the orphanage had to sell the excess on for very little while much needed beds and facilities were ignored.

I remember that money was spent on biblical literature and for visiting christian dignitaries to get thier pictures taken with thier suffering flock

My Dad is a former vicar of the Church of England. He is now an important part of the Anglican Health Organisation. They spend the money of the rich european christians on various health initiatives around the world. The only problem is, they don't really have enough to deal with the reality. I mean they have next to nothing. Your jaw will drop to lean how little four million euros will actually do for 300 million people.

Third world countries cannot compete with european and american imports. Thier dairy farmers go out of business because the price of american imported powdered milk is cheaper. Its paid for by the 'cash crops' like diamonds or coffee beans or sugar, whose prices are dependant on the whim of richer nations. When the prices drop because all the rich wives have enough diamond rings for a few years, those nations dont have the money to deal with the next unfortunate rainfall, and those pictures are the result. 

Its this simple. The first world protects itself by slapping tariffs and import changes on the apple the african farmer tries to sell over here because hes out of business in his own country. This allows its citizens to grow rich and provide you with a nice house, education and internet access. Feels good doesnt it?

Next to the mounting debt, famine and disease problems, charity does next to nothing. The only solution is wholesale reform of the economic system. Religions in America (the country that more or less says what does or doesnt go) provide enormous support for right wing candidates who believe protectionism is right, moral and christian. 

They vote for the people who make the world burn, who convince them that abortion and homosexuality is more important, then reassure themselves they are moral, because they give to charity. Its a generalisation, but fairly accurate

EDIT: On reflection, its unfair to say religious people do nothing. They don't do nothing, but what they do is not good enough. I'm sorry but i compare what people actually do with the intelligence they are genuinely capable of, and on the religious right they fall so far short. I can't accept, 'i don't understand the situation but my congressman is a good christian and he says hes doing the right thing, and anyway, i gave 10$ a month to charity'",t1_c117i0f,1286065648,sup3rm0d1f13d,t5_2qh2p

The first is DRM, or rather the symptom of DRM which is reduced choice. I have bought something, yet I can't use it in a way in which I want to. If I buy something on iTunes I can't watch it on my PS3 through my DLNA server because of DRM. It's absurd. Im pretty sure that when I used to buy VHS tapes I could play them on more than one brand of player. It's an absurd retrograde step. 

The other issue is availability. I'm not American but there are a number of American tv shows I enjoy. The networks are more than willing to use global platforms to market these shows but don't make them available globally. Take The Office, for example. I'm a fan and season 7 has just started in the US. I've seen numerous adverts for it online. As it stands, I can't get it legally. NBC has made it impossible for me to buy it from them. In this case, where they have clearly rejected my custom, I have no moral issues with pirating it (without ads, DRM and in 720p). If you look at the pirate tv charts, availability is clearly a major driving force. American TV shows are downloaded in Europe (Lost, Heroes, 24 etc were heavily downloaded but couldn't be bought legally) and European shows are downloaded in the US (Top Gear, Dr Who and Sherlock were all downloaded heavily).

Prohibition on drugs creates a huge and immensely profitable black market.  Let's be clear that the drug trade is orders of magnitude more profitable than any other type of crime.  Return on investment, even at the street level, and after costs, is in the thousands of percent.  In BC, where I live, you can earn $10,000 for driving a vehicle loaded with marijuana to Ontario, within spitting distance of the US border; it's about a 3 or 4 day trip you don't grow it, you don't sell it, you're just a courier.   The risk for this type of venture is relatively low, low enough that there is no shortage of people willing to take the trip.

Moving the marijuana across the border into the US is an order of magnitude more risky - and also more profitable.  Dealing in Cocaine jumps another order.  

Now let's look at those boat-jackers.  Say it's a $30,000 boat.  Stolen property typically sells at 20 cents on the dollar, so they might be able to fence it for $6,000 ... which is split two ways.   And the risk is much, much higher than for the guy who drives the drugs.  As a business proposition, it's far less enticing than trafficking drugs.  This is a crime of desperation, not choice.

[The UN estimates that the world drug trade in 2003 was worth around $320 Billion.](http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2005/06/30/un_report_puts_worlds_illicit_drug_trade_at_estimated_321b/)  That is a huge market, and the bigger it gets, the more players it attracts, which has a normalizing effect, which in turn makes it more attractive, and so on.  THe end result is that more and more young people look to the drug trade as a viable career path.  

This has been the case in Northern Mexico, which due to geographic circumstance, is a hub for cocaine travelling to the US.  The numbers of people involved in the drug trade there grow year after year - it has become a viable career path for many young men.  Furthermore, this trade is so profitable that the industry leaders can afford to, literally, finance a war against the Mexican police and military.  

So there is a huge amount of money in the market; and more and more players entering the marketplace everyday, attracted by the vast sums of money to be made.  You now have a whole class of people involved with the black market, to whom crime and violence become increasingly normalized.  

And then, the market hits a crisis - as is currently happening in Mexico, with the government doubling it's prohibition efforts, and the competition increasing amongst cartels, the US tightening border security, etc..  Temporarily, the costs go up, while return goes down.  The low level players are the first to feel the squeeze as the flow of easy money dries up.... They are now habituated criminals, and will look to other types of crime to supplement their income.  And you start to see desperate acts of violence like you're seeing in Texas right now.  

Nobody becomes a criminal to jack boats - it's just not worth it. That's a crime of desperation, not a viable career.  Which is why  there's no epidemic of boat jackings, or armed robberies, or car-jackings in North America right now.  The drug trade, however, is pervasive, and there is enough money available to attract new players every day.  It's an epidemic, and it's becoming more and more normalized.  And the irony is, the more successful the ""war on drugs"" is, the more profitable the business becomes.

As for the reason there is a higher amount of natives in Peru and Ecuador, it may be wise to refer to the Incas, Chile didn't have a huge indigenous cultures like the Incas or Mayas. Chile is not homogeneous, Santiago is, the rest of Chile is filled with many more natives, as you would notice in most other latin countries, the main cities are filled with Mestizos and the majority of natives are rural.
Chile basically stole sea access from Bolivia, and even though no Bolivians live there it is something that would be vital for Bolivia's development.

The AV makes the system fairer using the same constituencies because the person elected has had at least 50% of the vote. PR et al re-enforce the ""party"" aspect of politics, and your local representation will instead be a party-line follower rather than someone who actually has to represent the people who elected him.

PR is useful for one thing, and one thing only: Political Parties. If you truly want PR, you could have the House of Commons elected by AV/FPTP and the House of Lords (or whatever it is renamed to) being a party-list system.

Personally (and I'm going on a bit now) my ideal electoral/political reform would be:

* AV introduced.
* Constituencies redrawn by an independent commission, making sure that they are of roughly equal size.
* Appoint no new peers, set the current figure, and allow randomly selected people to discuss/vote for their preference per issue. This would be done like the jury system, and over time you'd end up with 722 ""jurors"", each debating only one bill before returning to society.
* The removal of ""Royal Assent"" and for the Queen to be the last monarch of the United Kingdom. After that, the Head of State would be the Prime Minister.

In my system, you have a true democracy with the benefit of democratically elected representation putting forward the bills for consideration, and a randomly selected subset of the population ensuring that the bills are fair.

Then, we could boost our grid to the point of being able to significantly power electric cars, and put more money into public transport to make it more reputable and convenient. 

AI's driving cars would also have the added benefit of being able to increase driving efficiency with a bunch of algorithms and response times that only a professional racer could dream of.

European Miracle is problematic. This was the go-to book on the ""rise of the west"" for many years, but Jones' ultimate thesis is too simple: it truly was some sort of indefinable miracle that let the wet ""win."" (I know this is a simplification, but it embodies what I saw to be a major problem with the book) The discussion of certain regions in this book is unbalanced, and some of his implications are downright racist or stereotypical. Despite these points, I really enjoyed discussing the book after I read it, and I could go into more depth if requested.

My suggestions for the topic:

http://www.amazon.com/ReORIENT-Global-Economy-Asian-Age/dp/0520214749/

Highly enjoyable. Frank goes into the importance of silver as a commodity (not a currency) in centering the world economy on Asia, and how this ultimately led to the rise of the West.

http://www.amazon.com/Eastern-Origins-Western-Civilisation/dp/0521547245/

A briskly paced look at the cultural and technological origins of Western concepts that began in the East. Deals with India more than other books do in this subject (but still not much).

http://www.amazon.com/Rise-Early-Modern-Science-Islam/dp/0521529948/
Excellent study of how Islam had it and lost it. Might be more of what you already read, but probably explains it better. Huff presents a unique theory of ""neutral zones"" that allowed science and culture to flourish that were lacking in Islamic society after a certain period. I walked away from this book really amazed that Islamic culture didn't triumph. Don't let the title fool you, I can't stand the history of science, but I found this book immensely enjoyable.

http://www.amazon.com/Before-European-Hegemony-D-1250-1350/dp/0195067746/

My personal fav in this area of study.  Abu Lughod pushes back the timeline to the 13th century, and sees the origins of a global world system in uniquely connected locations like French markets and Mongolian desert trails. The destruction of this early world market had profound effects on the later battle between East and West. Read this after you've read a few other books on the topic. It will be a nice step back that forces you to think differently and question what you know with a revisionist slant.

All of these books run with the idea that if you had asked someone before approx 1700 (although this date would vary between authors) which hemisphere would rise to power, nearly everyone would have said the East.

I think the Executive, which constitutionally is drawn from the lower house, should be derived on the basis of PR for the whole country as its primary purpose is to enact nationwide legislation and policies. The 'local MP' business usually comes down to having problems with individual pieces of proposed legislation (as in where you'd want a check/balance) or just wanting someone important to deal with problems you're having in a local way, in which case it could happily be a Lord.

I agree with your problem about reinforcing party lists with AV+, which is why I would prefer that the PR appointed house is appointed using STV, not AV+. STV would not have party lists- the problem is you'd have extremely large constituencies, which isn't actually a problem if your locally AV appointed Lord is actually your 'go to' person if you have a local problem and is actually your direct representation.

I also don't really want to see the Monarchy taken apart...I don't have particularly strong feelings for it, but I personally have a *much* greater respect for the monarchy as an institution and as a head of state than I ever would or could have for a politician.

I'm also very pro-EU! :)

TL;DR:

* AV in the House of Lords: these guys become what the local MPs do now. Their job is primarily to respond to constituents problems and to act as a legitimate check/balance against the other house. Elections out of step with the House of Commons so you don't have to vote twice at the same time.

* STV for the House of Commons: no party lists. Executive is drawn from the House of Commons in the same way it is now.

I hope that's at least some food for thought! I'd like to see PR without losing our 'local MP' connection and I think this would achieve it. The Lords would be totally different to what it is now, but honestly I don't think the Lords really does anything useful at all as it is. Maybe I'm just naive.

I'd also like to add that having a referendum on AV is a good first step to achieving either of AV+ or STV in my opinion. Moving from one vote to multiple votes will always be the biggest conceptual change, even if it doesn't change the political landscape much. Once that is achieved the voters themselves won't see a great difference in the voting method if we moved to STV or AV+.

She's right too that there's a stereotype of ale drinkers in the UK as being old men and it's good to see this changing.  
I'd introduce a note of caution there though as it has happened before. 10-15 years ago the major pub chains were opening Tap and Spiles and Hogshead Alehouses all over the place- probably in response to the success of the Wetherspoon chain- and things were looking pretty good. Most towns had at least one pub where you could buy a selection of decent ales and it looked like the major chains were giving their backing to traditional cask ale. Then the next marketing gimmick came along and they vanished as quickly as they had appeared.

1)  Thomas Keller is French. *French.*  The Europeans do not have bacon as we know it, and do not traditionally smoke those cuts of the pig.  ***They have them, but they choose not to smoke them.***  Let that sink in for a minute.  His Frenchiness would utterly impeach any opinions he might have on the BLT if he hadn't already embarrassed himself by publishing that fried egg abomination.

It shows a fundamental and childlike misunderstanding of the bacon, in that it's obvious that when he thinks bacon he thinks breakfast, and so he proceeds to make a bacon-and-egg sandwich with lettuce and tomato.

That is not a BLT.  A BLT with an extra ingredient is not a BLT.    

Having something extra doesn't matter, you say?  Well then, if you don't mind egg in your BLT then next time you're making love to your wife perhaps you won't mind if I'm standing in the room.  Thomas Keller says it's okay -- he's French.

2)  ""Freshness"" has nothing to do with the bacon absorbing moisture from the tomato.  First, bacon is a cured meat product.  It is, by definition, not fresh.  It has everything to do with moisture being re-introduced to something that has been crisped by having its moisture removed. If the hygroscopic bacon comes in contact with tomato water its outer layers will re-hydrate, and you will have bacon with a crispy inner core covered in a slimy bacon paste.

3)  As mentioned above, the mayonnaise (the only French contribution to this dish) protects the *toast* from the moisture in the tomato.  The oil and egg provide a very effective moisture barrier.  The *toast* is not at risk.

4)  I'm sorry, but after your French-egg-sandwich-on bread-with-tomato-in-the-middle-in-direct-contact-with-the-bacon-is-still-a-BLT atrocities I just can't treat your musings on bacon placement with any seriousness.

As part of my PUA transformation, my plan of attack was to lord some clubs. I've been djing/producing for a long while so I am known amongst that community. To the plebeians however, I am not- study and work mean presence has been erratic in the past.  

I became a promoter at a top club to change this. For the job, I crafted a new facebook (just under a thousand hand picked girls) where I send out one weekly event notification. In exchange, I get money, free entry for whomever i want, VIP and just generally know everyone on the scene. 

Being this involved and frequenting the same clubs has really changed my personality. My party vibe is intimidating, I do whatever I want, whenever I want. My persona is playful yet assertive and I exude confidence without being macho. I try to reflect this in what I wear. I dress up uniquely- skinny pants, fitted boldly patterned button up shirt with a skinny tie and rabens.

The confidence and club status (they feed off each other) I've gained has done wonders for pickup. Hate to boast, for the last two months I've had a 100% success rate; k-closes, f-closes and a barrel of numbers. The process is mechanical now.

It seems like there is something that a lot of people on reddit who are very passionate about the Israel-Palestine issue need to realise: the Israelis and Palestinians _need_ to compromise and share the land fairly. The example I mentioned earlier of South Africa is relevant. The non-white population in South Africa was degraded since the day the first European settlers arrived. That degradation was enshrined in the law from 1948 until 1994. The non-white population did not, for the most part, take up arms. Instead, they fought a war of ideas. By undermining the support for apartheid among white South Africans, the process of transformation was set in motion.

The Palestinians could seek to pursue this same path. Israeli citizens are not heartless robots. If the Palestinians peacefully opposed Israeli incursions into their land, this would be interpreted in a very different light by the mainstream of Israeli society.

So, the proof is in the pudding really. Palestinians have been trying to beat Israel by violent means for how long now? And how successful have they been? Yeah... precisely.

It would be a part of it. Other factors like education and poverty all play into it. 

Not to mention that the lack of strong central governments play a part. We take stability for granted, which the African nations don't seem to have as well as the fact that Africans still seem to have a tribal mentality (Rawandan Genocide, Hutu against the Tutsi) rather than a national identity.(Talking out of my ass there, I don't know much about Africa)

India is one nation which spans linguistic boundaries and the largely peaceful structure seems to suggest that different groups could coexist.

I'm a huge thorium and LFTR advocate and really want to see it happen. However, I think weaponization concerns are overblown. I think the plutonium economy would have made the world safer, not more dangerous, because most wars are caused by resource conflicts (especially oil). More energy means that the world will be richer and more peaceful.

&gt;Arguably this limits freedom and experience in driving

If depends on how it is designed. Maybe we could make some sort of AI-assisted driving or something like that, so people that want to have ""control"" over their car still can. And you can always go out in the country and drive all you want. For cities that have awful traffic (I live in DC and have friends that live in the SF Bay Area), AI drivers would be a huge improvement in their daily lives.

&gt;Also, a better train system should reduce jet travel, which is a massive consumer of energy. If we find that only construction, freight, and other industries that really need gas are using it, we could extend the effective lifetime of oil by a lot.

Another thing I didn't mention above that I'm interested in is synthetic fuels. We can still use jet fuel, gasoline, etc. after we have our nuclear age. But we will manufacture them in environmentally sustainable ways. For example, you can make gasoline and jet fuel by simply combining air and water (that is how plants and the Earth did it in the first place anyways). One such process is:

Step 1: Capture CO2 from the atmosphere or dissolved in ocean water.

Step 2: Electrolysis: 2 H20 → 2 H2 + 2O

Step 3: [Sabatier reaction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabatier_reaction): CO2 + 4H2 → CH4 + 2H2O (we now methane)

Step 4: Steam Reforming: H2O + CH4 → CO + 3 H2 

Step 5: [Fischer-Tropsch Process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer-tropsch):  (2n+1) H2 + n CO → CnH(2n+2) + n H2O  (if n=8, we have octane)

This process does require a large energy input, but if we have a fleet of LFTRs and eventually fusion providing extremely cheap electricity and heat, that won't be a problem. This also is completely carbon neutral because the amount of CO2 released by the jets is the same amount sucked in by the electrolysis. There are probably plenty of other potentially more efficient ways to create liquid fuels as well if we have a huge cheap source of energy. We might also be able to use [methanol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanol_fuel), [aluminum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_battery), and [boron](http://bravenewclimate.com/2009/01/13/prescription-for-the-planet-part-ii-newclear-energy-and-boron-powered-vehicles/) for fuels. As the Cable Guy said ""There's no end to the possibilities!""

&gt;Of course, this is all rather unlikely, largely because of how politics and capitalism work. I suppose the EU can be a leader on this (I think they already are), but America will probably lag behind for a while.

I agree. However, eventually our current unsustainable practices will have to end by definition.

Almost every famous scientist, philosopher, politician and social activist was impeded by religion (namely christianity, but most abrahamic religions apply) in one way or another. Shit, Einstein famously rejected quantum mechanics, saying ""God does not play dice."" Who knows how much more that man would've accomplished if he had come to terms with the idea that the universe is dynamic. And there's a plethora of other examples, if you're thinking ""well that's just einstein"". Your lauding of faith? Absolutely fucking ridiculous. Oh yeah, we should *believe something without any proof.* That's a great idea! Nothin' can go wrong there! The reason why we've made so many advances since the renaissance is because we developed the scientific principles of observing physical phenomena and coming up with conclusions that can be replicated and backed by logical reasoning. The notion that we should blindly follow scripture written thousands of years ago, without any semblance of rationality or evidence to confirm it's wildly grandiose claims, is so laughable that I don't even pity you jesuits. Your idea that you should respect authority is twice as ridiculous. What if Gandhi had respected British authority? What if the colonists had respected Britain's taxation? If MLK had respected the authority of the McCarthyists? Authority is something that's meant to be struggled against. If we submit to authority for even one second, we lose our rights. While I agree, slander and ad-hominems are pointless, silly, and should be chastised, especially republicans that toss around that shit about the president, but I'll be damned if I let the powers that be rule over me without opposition. With the exception of his extrajudicial assassinations and human rights violations, I wholeheartedly support the president. But if he starts fucking my shit up I will not respect him, and neither should you. Saying ""God did it"" doesn't change the fact that a corrupt politician is an asshole that should be rebelled against, and though telling your friends you shouldn't carelessly mock the president (especially since the implications that he's a terrorist is extremely fucking racist) is good, telling them they should respect him because he's authority because that's what God wants us to do is fucking retarded on so many levels. 

The chapter ""Rebellion"" from The Brothers Karamazov mocked the idea of hell. It gives the example of a Russian general that, for no reason at all, stripped an innocent 5 year old boy naked, put him in a field, and let a group of hungry dogs loose. The dogs ate him alive. According to Christianity, the general is going to burn in hell as punishment. But what does this achieve? Does it erase the painful death of the boy? Does it take wipe away the tears cried by his mother that day? Does it prevent the general from committing any more horrible crimes? Does it revive the boy, letting him live a full life, experiencing everything the world has to offer? You'd think that the almighty creator would see the flaw in this schematic. And he would, but humans wouldn't, which is where the idea of hell comes from. If there was a God orchestrating all these, he'd clearly see the problem with punishing someone after they've already died. And if God really loves us, why does he create evil? God specifically states that he creates evil in the bible. Why? Why does God need evil? Why is eating the apple of knowledge so bad? Why is God surprised by the fact that they ate the apple? If he's omnipotent, wouldn't he already know what was going to happen? If so, why doesn't he prevent it? Why does he put the fucking tree there in the first place? Why does he choose to throw them out of the garden of eden? They had no free will at that point, so they had no choice but to eat the apple. If they had no free will, and God orchestrates everything, then God implicitly made his creations commit the only sin, and then punishes them and the entire human race for an act that not only did they have no choice in committing, but an act that he specifically wanted them to commit. This all points to ""God fucking hates you."" I've put this hypothesis forward to a lot of Christians, and what did they all tell me?

""God works in mysterious ways.""

Fact is, Marx was right. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people. It's the desperate attempt of the trampled and disheartened to cling to the idea that if they follow these set of rules, they'll achieve an everlasting ecstasy beyond all comprehension. It's whimsical fantasy. According to your scripture, the more we move towards secularism, the more God will punish us. But we can clearly see that Europe's quality of life is improving, while America is going to absolute shit. Christians have blocked progress at every. Fucking. Turn. When we wanted to free blacks? Christians said no. When we wanted to give blacks the right to vote? Christians said no. When we wanted to end segregation? Christians said no. When we wanted to grant women rights? Christians said no. Now that we want to give gays rights? Christians say no. In 30 years people will look back at people like you in disgust of your bigotry. You people argue against Evolution, which is pretty much scientific fact. You argue against stem cell research, even though most stem cells are made in labs, NOT being harvested from abortions. They're blinded by religion. And of course, you're going to say ""That's my point, if you ignore christians, christianity is great"" but the fact is that most Christians get their stupidity from Christianity. Some parts of the bible are great. Christ was a pretty cool guy. But for every tolerant, nice, peaceful part of the bible, there's a violent and bigoted passage that can be used to justify Christians' asshattery. It's not like these morons make up scriptures to interpret. It's all in there. If it weren't in there, they wouldn't have anything to back up their ignorance. But they do, because it's in there, because of Christianity. You seem to be one of the better jesuits. And I commend you for thinking a little bit more than other people. But you're still listening to an archaic, shitty religion that spreads intolerance. And why? Probably because your mum and dad said it was right. Because mom and dad are always accurate. 

And on the topic of your anti-abortion stance: **FUCK YOU** for making victims of incest and rape carry their rapist's baby, go through labor, pay thousands of dollars for hospital bills, and then support the kid who was born out of tragedy for it's entire life. No, seriously. I can deal with your bigotry. There's bigotry among atheists. I can deal with your blockading of scientific progress.

I stated a fact - that the Church suppressed popular learning and innovation, meaning that the bulk of the European world at the end of the Dark Ages was not much more technically advanced, learned or capable of implementing the sort of technological infrastructure that would have been there had people just been left to their own devices.

After that I *specifically* used the words 'arguably' and 'if true', in anticipation that someone would disagree and, for whatever reason, say that the Dark Ages hardly held humanity back at all and that we exist right now as if they hadn't happened.

I *specifically* used the words 'arguably' and 'if true', in anticipation of someone storming in and saying that things like social, economical and political changes are very important as well - obviously, this person would have to ignore the fact that there were very few of THESE changes during the Dark Ages as well...

Anyway, I think the Dark Ages delayed advancement enormously until certain technological developments and the input from the Muslim and Chinese worlds made a revolution inevitable, but you cannot sum up objection to this as saying that it is '*not true*'.  It is arguably the case whether you like it or not, and if true they have indeed held civilisation back.

Also, it doesn't matter to me that the indigenous Americans, the Chinese and the Byzantine Empire didn't have an equivalent to the Dark Ages.  At the end of the day, European advancement borrowed somewhat from other cultures and in technology came out ahead, whether our other cultural brethren had their own Dark Ages or not.  Sure, the Chinese discovered gunpowder, paper and movable type before we would have, and this possibly played its part in the European developments, but the contribution of the indigenous Americans to the European Enlightenment and the Renaissance was...well, let's say 'slight'.",t1_c117pa1,1286096638,MagicSPA,t5_2qh1i

Why should we be against borrowing from China? Personally, I'm not qualified in economics but i know enough to understand that for the spreads to go up exponentially in one month leading to Greece's inability to borrow from markets, for our internal economy to have become stagnant -at best- and all sorts of market discouragement policies to come in place by a socialist (sic) government, there was probably a deal for this already in place, with the usual amount of people/organisations/etc benefiting. 

 So, I say why not to China buying our debt. Also, why not expand the port of Piraeus to a big export manufacturing zone where they can put in the last screw in a product and label it as made in EU. It's not that we used the port efficiently to generate income in the first place. I'd even suggest we buy normal submarines instead of defective ones from our ""friend/lenders"", but this is a huge discussion.. 

 I don't really know what i'm talking about here, but my point is: is borrowing from China a sign of lack of balls? Or would that be the whole IMF fiasco? Maybe doing something to better our position on our own (outside the usual ""friends"" with benefits) might even be a ballsier move if we manage to achieve good terms, at least it shows a little diversification from the IMF program, give the overlords a little competition. Naturally, i'm still very skeptical and not happily/blindly saying this is the way to go, but won't rule it out as an opportunity worth investigating.

That makes me longing back to southside Alpes. Go there for the freshest pasta's in the world, and breathtaking Alpencol routes.

If you don't like to climb up mountain cols for hours, and/or you prefer beer and bacon to pizzas and wine, you could ride southern Netherlands - Belgium - Luxembourg and the French / German border zone. You can choose to ride the hills (Ardennes, Eifel, Vosges) or follow the rivers (Maas / Meuse, Mosel, Saar, Rhine).

If you like your beer in large mugs, but lighter in alcohol so in the morning you won't be hammered too much to ride, then take a look at Czechia. I'd recommend to roughly follow the Vltavou river (you could plan from Dresden to Vienna, you can pick up a lot of history and culture along that line).

In general, when i plan cycling trips throughout Europe, i like to look for older roads near cultural or natural border lines (borders between countries, between land and water, along rivers and contrasting lines in geological sense).

http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_many_Ukrainians_died_in_World_War_2

Ukraine casualty figures are hard to calculate, for they were integrated with that of the other nations that made up The Soviet Union at the time such as Russia, Georgia etc.

Upon the German invasion, some quarters of the Ukranian population welcomed the Germans as liberators from what had been horrific treatment from Stalin.

The Ukraine had been pushing for independence from The Soviet Union, and hardline Ukrainan nationalists became partisans for the Germans, attacking the Red Army in directions it could access.

Soviet civillian partisans and Red Army partisans conducted guerrila warfare against the Germans and the Ukranian nationialists.

It was very ugly, with civillians being killed for being anti german, or anti Ukraine nationalist, or anti Soviet.

Certain quarters of the German High command argued that the Ukraine could be allies against the Soviets should the Germans continue in acting as liberators in the Ukrainian's eyes.

However, the hardline Nazi view rejected this and treated Ukrainians as beneath them, killing, maiming, looting, imprisoning, starving, raping, and throwing people out of their homes to freeze to death so the German soldiers had a warm place to sleep, before in many cases, looting the house, and burning it to the ground and then moving on.

Eventually, the Ukranian nationalists realised what the Germans were about, and chose with the rest of the Soviet Union, to have a Russian speaking dictator then a German speaking dictator as their oppressor.

They thus began partisan acts against the German Army, as well as continuing partisan acts against The Red Army and war with Soviet partisans.

Thus, with them fighting against two powerful enemies and another partisan faction, the Ukranian nationlists suffered heavy casualties, as well as Ukranian civillians killed for their homes or reprisal for partisan action, and the Ukranians also suffered heavy casuaties fighting for the integrated Red Army all over the Soviet Union.

In conclusion then, Ukranian deaths were most likely high, and at the very least a few million died.

We may never know for sure, 27 to 28 million Soviets are believed to have died, and that number is inclusive of all the nations that fought as The Soviet Union.

In 1939 the Jewish population of Ukraine was 1.5 million (1,532,776) or 3% of the total population of Ukraine. When the War started on June 22, 1941 the Soviet Government first of all ordered the execution of all 19,000 Ukrainian political prisoners in western Ukraine (750,000 had already been killed or exiled to Siberia) and then the evacuation of 3.5 million key personnel to the east, to Russia. These evacuees included many Jews who were highly educated, and were scientists, skilled workers, Communist bureacrats, and NKVD secret police. The total evacuated was estimated to be about one-half to two-thirds of the total Jewish population of Ukraine (Reitlinger p. 251).

As the German Army swept east across Ukraine it included German Einsatzgruppen with 500 to 1,000 men which were special mobile killing squads ordered to carry out ""The Final Solution"" of killing all Jews. Ukraine had been the major part of the Jewish Pale of Settlement in the Russian Empire and in the 19th century probably had the most Jews of any country in the world. Within a few days of capturing Ukrainian cities like Lutsk, Zhitomir and Berdichev in the Summer of 1941 thousands of Jews were killed. A total of 600,000 Ukrainian Jews perished. Most of these executions were carried out by the SS Standartfuehrer Paul Blobel who was the officer of the Sonderkommando 4A, Einsatzgruppe C. Only German personnel, no Ukrainians, were members of the Einsatzgruppe C and D which were assigned to Ukraine. 

http://www.dpcamps.org/jewsVsUkrainians.html

Ukraine lost more people in WW II than any other European country, estimated at 11 million people by Stephan G. Prociuk (Annals of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts and Sciences in the US):

      ""At the end of the war, Ukraine lay in ruins; the populations had declined by 25 per cent -- that is by approximately 10.5 million people; 6.8 million killed or died of hunger or disease, and the remainder had been evacuated or deported to Soviet Asia as political prisoners or had ended up as slave labor or émigrés in Hitler's Germany..."" wrote Ann Lencyk Pawliczko in Ukraine and Ukrainians Throughout the World (University of Toronto Press, 1994, p.62). 

Still others estimate Ukrainian losses at 13.9 million. ""The Museum of World War II in the capital Kiev has a simple sign on marble which states: 'In 1940 in Ukraine lived 41.3 million people. In 1945 - 27.4 million people.' About 8 million Ukrainian citizens [not soldiers] (other estimates say 10 million) were killed in World War II"" wrote Andrew Gregorovich, 1998-2000.

According to the University of Hawaii democide table, Slavs were killed at twice the rate of the Jews. Also, it shows the heaviest democide at over 12 million USSR population (Univ. of Hawaii). Remember, that Ukrainians were listed as citizens of USSR and Poland; and Hitler occupied Ukraine for 3 years before he entered Russia proper (http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/NAZIS.TAB1.1.GIF, 2004).

10. According to Ukrainian estimates about 3,000,000 Ukrainians were sent to Germany and Austria to work in factories as zwangsarbeiter (forced labor) and the Ostarbeiter (east workers, i.e. Ukrainian slaves). Thousands died on the factory floor of exhaustion and starvation. Others died in the Allied bombings. My mother, from Galicia, went willingly for job opportunities but then was converted to slave labor. My Ukrainian friend's mother stayed alive on one slice of bread and one cup of watery soup every day.

11. Evidence to annihilate: ""No documentary evidence exists of Hitler's order to eliminate all Jews in Europe but we know this is true. Likewise, we have no Hitler order to annihilate the Ukrainians. But we do have the evidence (http://infoukes.com/history/ww2/):

      • Millions of civilian victims perished which could not be ""accidental.""
      • Documentary evidence of the wholesale executions of Ukrainians.
      • The order to execute up to 100 innocent Ukrainians for one German soldier shot by the partisans and 460,000 German soldiers were killed by partisans and guerillas.
      • German documents attest that the The Ostarbeiter Ukrainian slaves were to be 'worked to death' in Germany. Armaments minister Alber Speer wrote that his work force was dwindling, that he needed a fresh supply of 40,000 every month, a rate of 10,000 a day. (http://infoukes.com/history/ww2/page-13.html)
      • Millions of prisoners of war were intentionally starved to death in concentration camps.
      • Ukrainian cities were starved to death according to plan.
      • Nazi leaders said that Ukraine, as the Lebensraum (new living space) of Nazi Germany, would be colonized by German population and some Ukrainians would be used as slave labor.
      • Ukrainians disproportionate civilian losses compared to military also indicate a special Nazi German campaign.
      • Reichmarshal Goeing, second to Hitler in power, said: ""This year between twenty and thirty million persons will die [in Ukraine and] Russia of hunger. Perhaps it is well that it should be so, for certain nations must be decimated."" Nov. 24-27, 1941 (Dallin p.123)
      • Like Bormann and Goering, SS leader Heinrich Himler said that ""the entire Ukrainian intelligentsia must be decimated."" (Dallin, p. 127)

12. Many Ukrainians were involved in the rescue of Jews during the Nazi occupation. On 8 November 1992, The Ukrainian Weekly reported that during the first Jewish Congress of Ukraine, held in Kiev, ""48 awards were handed out to Ukrainians and people of other nationalities who had rescued Jews during the Second World War.""",t1_c1183hw,1286109896,DrDm,t5_2qh13

First of all, almost all major religions (Christians, Jews, Buddhist, Hindu, and Muslims, etc) all have various head covering traditions.  

You know, hats. How do they fucking work?

For example, [here are some illustrations of womens head coverings](http://www.scrollpublishing.com/store/head-covering-history.html) through the 20th century in Christian Europe.

Pretty fucking conservative if you ask me...and these sorts of head coverings don't bother me.  However, there was this little movement in the late 19th C that continues today called the Women's liberation movement that allows women to be emancipated - you know - to testify in court - to vote - to be considered a citizen - to acknowledge that you can be raped by your husband - to be able to sign a fucking contract in your own name.

Oh, and it also has a basic tenet of being able to dress however the fuck you want to (within the guidelines of Vogue magazine).  So, ladies developed style...like hats with plumes.  And eventually gave up the hat.

So, along comes some ""enlightened"" muslims who are FORCING THEIR WOMEN TO COVER THEIR FACES, PARTICIPATING IN HONOR KILLINGS FOR DISOBEYING THEIR HUSBANDS, KEEPING HOUSEHOLD SLAVES, AND ENGAGING IN OTHER MEDIEVAL BEHAVIOR LIKE NOT LETTING WOMEN DRIVE -- and enlightened liberal europe doesn't have a problem with this?

Suppose you have a simple car with a motor and a battery.  Batteries can store energy up to a certain point.  That's called the capacity.  Usually, that's measured in amp/hours, but for the sake of simplicity, let's call it ""energy units"" or eu.  Suppose our car battery can store 10 eu.  Also, for sake of simplicity, let's assume our car gets 1 mile per eu.  So, with some simple math, we can see that we can drive our car 10 miles before the battery is dead.  10 miles = 10 eu.

OK, suppose we rigged up another battery (which is dead) and a generator, and drove that from one of the wheels.  

What happens now, though, is that when the generator is applied, the motor has to work much harder to move the car over the same distance.  It works harder because now it's not only moving the car, it's spinning the generator.  In fact, it's not unreasonable to think that it works twice as hard.  So, if the motor is working twice as hard, it's only going to be able to move the car 1/2 the distance.  So, our battery is going to be dead after 5 miles.  What happened is that 5 eu went into moving the car, and 5 eu went into spinning the generator.  (Contrary to what many people think, a generator does not spin easily.  They are actually quite difficult to spin when they are generating power.)

So, since we applied 5 eu to the generator, doesn't that mean that there was 5 eu stored in the second battery?  For a second, let's assume that was the case.  So, we have one dead battery, and one battery with 5 eu in it.  How far can we go?  Even if we disconnected the generator, so it was not adding resistance, we know from the example that the car would travel no more than 5 miles.  Dammit!  We haven't gained anything.  Our range is still 10 miles!

But...generators are not that efficient.  A decent generator that you could buy and install in a car is probably no more than 60% efficient.  So, if you applied 5 eu to the generator to spin it, you only generated 3 eu which could be stored in the battery.  So, when the first battery is dead after 5 miles, the second battery only contains enough power to move the car three more miles at best.  Adding the second battery and generator actually reduced the range of our car from 10 to 8.  It was actually worse than just using a battery and motor to begin with.",t1_c118ahw,1286114217,brock_lee,t5_2qh1i

It's highly unlikely you're one of them (wrong semester), but I'll tell you the same things I tell them ..

Re: being an American, get over it.  Honestly, with no malice intended, it'll only be a big deal if you make a big deal of it.  Galway has people from everywhere, especially in/around the uni/colleges. Learn to use your inside voice a little more, don't expect customer service to mean the same thing it does in the US, and learn to just go with the flow a bit more.
Be aware of the stereotypes, but don't *be* the stereotypes.

Re: being a female American, this may get you in more trouble.  Do be aware that despite what hollywood tells you, Irish women aren't the prettiest creatures to grace the planet.  There are of course exceptions, but you'll discover most are exceptional in the wrong direction.  What this means to you, is that you may find yourself drawing more attention than you're used to.  Before you let flattery take you places you hadn't anticipated, do look around you and establish where you fit in compared to the local average.  You'll most likely find a wildly different answer to home. 

There's a very high chance you're going to be lumped in with the erasmus students; a pan-european exchange program.  This can be fantastic if you're studying a european language, but do try to find a balance and make some irish friends, else you're not going to see anything any other budget tourist would see.  On the other hand, if you're not put in with the erasmus group, do try to seek them out.  They're a lot more prone to actually get out and see things, rather than being 'stuck in galway' for 4 months.  Balance is the key word here.

If this is your first time in europe, or you're not sure if/when next time will be, do try to apply some of your beer budget towards flights.  If you're willing to accept a level of service which doesn't rival that of a municipal bus service, you'll discover flights to the UK / continent are amazingly cheap.  I took our last exchange to scotland for a weekend when I realized she had no plans to step any further afield than Ireland.  If you can afford to spend a bit more on hotels, my last flight to Paris cost less than a good night on the beer.  While you're here to live/see/study Ireland, don't ignore that there's a lot of potential one-in-a-lifetimes €40 away.

Don't even consider driving.  It's a lot more work, and risk, than it's worth.  If you're not a complete shut-in, you'll find friends that drive.  Use them.  Use public transport (it's pretty normal here, not just for the homeless).  It's not just the right-hand-drive thing; roads here are completely different.  If you're not completely familiar with roundabouts/rotaries, they will drive you insane.  If you're not used to travelling freeway speeds on roads that may not be much wider than your car, they will drive you insane.  If you're not used to a country full of maniacs who clearly have no idea how to drive either, they will drive you insane.  And all of these will usually involve calling the rental company for a new car because you broke this one.

Studying will most likely be completely different, and quite honestly becomes one of your lowest priorities.  Don't completely blow it off, but do investigate how much of it will actually transfer home.  Also look into how things are scored; a lot of the time, 'top marks' is a theoretical maximum; you will find courses where 60% is more than acceptable, but will run completely counter to the ""must be #1"" attitude to education in the US. Also be aware that most the students you meet will be in education for practically no cost, leading to a huge difference in attitudes &amp; approaches.  This difference is difficult to describe, but you'll know exactly what I mean very quickly.

Finally; shit's expensive.  Deal with it, get over it.  Save as much as you can now.  Save more than you can now.  Cut every corner you can, now, and while you're here, and don't be overly afraid of a sensible amount of debt to go home to.  This isn't the most sensible financial advice you've ever heard, but for most people, this will be a once in a lifetime experience.  Make it count.

tl;dr; many nationalities have issues with the US govt &amp; a lot of its actions. Very few nationalities have issues with Americans themselves.  Learn to tell the two apart, and have fun.

The US is the by far biggest country by population in the western world. This makes it attractive to make TV shows there, simply because the potential audience is so large.

COSCO also leases the port of Piraeus. COSCO is a (partially) state owned corporation, so what the Chinese government is doing is to protect and expand it's investment. 
The fact that Piraeus is the closest EU port to China compounded with the fact there are serious reforms going on and Greece is moving to a market structure more close to capitalism (it was too socialist even for China before the EU-IMF restructure plan) means Greece is now a place of opportunity for China. 
**It is the stepping stone to a 500 million market.**

As for those that Greece is going down, check this out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_shipping and realize that most of the stuff made in China are carried in Greek owned ships anyway. All this is business as usual, just taking an already working relationship a notch up.

If you are eager for beer-related destinations at the end of the day, Belgium can't be beat. We rode to all of the Trappist abbeys in Southern Belgium and are eager to go back to the north sometime soon. The trip included a visit to the West Vleteren abbey in Flanders where the monks brew what is alleged to be the best beer in the world...only available at the abbey. It was delicious. Overall Belgium provides amazing natural and cultural scenery and too many cute bed and breakfasts that you'll have a hard time deciding where to stay (we camped).

The trip in Alsace started in Basel where we were easily able to meet up with the eurovelo 5 route on the Rhine along the French and German borders. This route is great because not only do you get a daily option of which country you ride in (and which cuisine you eat for dinner), but you can also mix it up between riding on the path by the river (very flat) or heading into the hills in the wine country in France. We opted for the latter (nothing very steep) and were rewarded with beautiful roads and routes through countless adorable French villages, each with their own delicious restaurant.

The reason people protest is the treatment of the citizens, Greek citizens were treated as borderline slaves to early Turkish and even later Turkish rule.

Brisbane tends to be pretty open, if you ask me... Australia as a whole, not so much.

&gt; This tells me there must be a fairly large group of muslims who are not moderate.

Because your definition of moderate means Muslims living in the West who behave as you, jstevewhite, want them to. So by that definition, there might be a lot of moderates in Britain but there certainly aren't in the Muslim world where the niqab is extremely common in many countries and is worn by millions. The closer that people are connected to their home countries and cultures, the more likely they'll bring over their cultural baggage to the UK and defy your expectation of what being a moderate is.

I find one definition of moderate and radical helpful and that is what a US Ambassador (to Kenya I believe) described about the situation in Somalia circa 2006 when the Islamic Courts Union was forced out of power by a Western-backed Ethiopian invasion inadvertently leading to an extreme radicalization of the entire ""Islamist"" movement in that country. The ICU was run by Sunnis (their leader is now the Western-backed President of the transitional government!) and they kept the more extreme/radical Salafis under control. However, both the Sunni and Salafi camps would have endorsed niqab/burqa-wearing, so obviously the US government doesn't seem to think that the niqab/burqa is criteria for distinction between moderates and extremists. 

What made the difference was pure civility. Those who were civilized (and preferred law and order, courts, government, engagement with the outside world... Sunnis) and those who were not (Salafis who later formed Al-Shabab... in favor of attacks that, if not directly target civilians, put civilians at great risk).

**TL;DR** The US govt called Somali Sunnis involved in the ICU, essentially a Somali version of the Taliban, ""moderates"" and called the Salafis (later known as Al-Shabab, or the Somali version of Al-Qaeda), ""extremists"", and their criteria for distinction was violence and they didn't give a damn about niqab, burqa, whatever. I'm not sure they justifiably could give a damn (like France), because the United States' strongest ally, arguably neither Great Britain nor Canada or Israel is Saudi-Arabia, a Salafi monarchy where most of the female population wears the niqab and which is also common throughout the Gulf Arab states (which are cool in our books... remember when Halliburton tried to move their headquarters to the UAE in 2007 or something?). In fact, the Orthodox community in Israel has its own issues with ""forcing"" women to cover ([some prefer burqas over wigs](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/7919501/Israeli-rabbis-clamp-down-on-burka.html)).

---

The sudden increased focus on the niqab/burqa in Europe is because of one major factor. The increasingly disastrous war in Afghanistan. According to [a Wikileaks release back in March](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpolitics/comments/cwj9n/wikileaks_release_from_back_in_march_explains/), NATO's plan to drum up popular support for a very unpopular war (in Europe where the population isn't so gung ho) was to focus on the persecution of women in Afghanistan, including renewing the burqa debate.

I, and countless others, have brought up the fact that the number of women who wear the burqa in France and the Netherlands is ridiculously low proportional to the rest of the Muslim female population. So why was the whole push to vilify the burqa started in those countries instead of the UK? Why did the former precede the latter?

It's pretty obvious. The UK has such a huge Muslim minority, and the most burqa wearers of probably any Western nation, and people have been used to this. Most madrassahs and many Islamic schools with secular curriculums mandate the hijab and sometimes the niqab, and have for a long, long time. But the UK's population didn't notice until they were taught to notice by their friends in mainland Europe over the course of the last decade. 

As the Wikileaks release indicated, the obvious propaganda move now is to appeal to people's instincts to rush to the aid of the Afghan women by focusing on issues at home that they face daily (although outside of the UK, how often do people see niqab wearers on a daily basis?).

This is despite the fact that [the European push to ban burqas appalls Afghan women, including all the moderates and pro-Western women](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/bw7uu/european_push_to_ban_burqas_appalls_afghan_women/). But of course, all the hoopla created here is mitigated by the media when they go to the Muslim world, it's only left to outlets like Al-Jazeera who aren't totally under the thumb of Western ""Big Media"" to bring these details to the Muslims over there.

It's funny, from the behavior of Western politicians, diplomats, corporations, and the latter's representatives and marketing campaigns in the Muslim world, one would think they would have zero issues whatsoever with conservative Islam.

The Hajj terminal of the Jeddah King Abdul-Aziz International Airport is plastered with ads from Panasonic which say ""May God accept your obedience"" or something like that.

Panasonic.

There are Burger Kings, Hardees, McDonald's, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken etc immediately outside the gates of the grand mosques in Mecca and Medina and they have gender-segregated lines (usually... Arabs seem to have an issue with queueing).

**TL;DR** All the issues you care about, you were taught to care about for the express purpose of your manipulation. And the parties and interests which taught you to care about these issues themselves do not give a fuck about anything other than making money. If and when Western economies finally start tanking, the corporations will move their operations to China, the Mid-East, wherever, including all of their jobs and will not give a fuck about, nor harbor any loyalty to, the color of your skin, your culture, or your beliefs/views. Welcome to Earth, home of humanity.

There is a movement in Middle-Eastern (especially Saudi) Islam today which is trying to completely integrate these outdated and inhuman tribal cultural traditions into Islam itself. 

And they're exporting that brand, backed by petrodollars, not just to the rest of the Arab World and other Muslim majority nations (Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, etc...) but also to places where Muslims are a minority (not just Europe and North America but also places like Thailand, the Philippines). 

When I'd visit Cairo 15 years ago you'd hardly ever see a ninja, and only sometimes see a woman wearing a hijab. Most women walked the streets with their hair free, even when dressed Arab style. Ninjas were looked at as strange, and even the hijab was thought to be a bit odd.

Today, ninjas are everywhere, and the great majority of women at least cover their hair. Those that don't are the ones who are now seen as odd. This is terrifying. One of my cousins (an Egyptian) refuses to cover her hair and this has caused her problems (rare, but getting more frequent). Her mother has begun to wear hijab, just to avoid the harassment, as has another of my female cousins.

Cable shares bandwidth among all the users in a particular area. In general it's 100 or more customers (for apartments and other high density it can be higher). To top that off it sounds to me like TW may have an overloaded exchange which will service many such nodes. 

&gt; Do you only have one choice when it comes to DSL/Landline?

In many areas in the US this can be the case. Communications providers are often granted local monopolies on contract with the town or state government. It's not uncommon to have only one or two choices for cable, phone or internet in your area. This problem is more prevalent in suburbs and areas further away from major cities. 

&gt;Isn't there anything that resembles municipal fibre optic connections? –And are they handing out laptops to children at the same time?

There have been attempts to do public internet or WiFi in some towns in the US. Anytime it comes up the local communications monopoly starts beating up the state saying it's anti-competitive and monopolistic (ahh the irony) for the local township to provide internet access.

The school likely is a TW subscriber on a business line. However it sounds like they are on the same exchange. So of course if the school has a program to put a computer on every students desk that has internet access this is going to be a significant spike of usage on what sounds like an already overloaded node or exchange. 

&gt;And there's no wireless ISP to use as a last restort? –Wasn't there something called Earthlink?

Wireless internet providers in the US have very poor penetration and likely will continue to be that way unless WiMax or LTE really gain ground.

Some of the issues we are dealing with are ones of scale. The US is much larger in land area than European countries for example. Extending infrastructure in the US, particularly to remote and suburban areas is an expensive proposition. It does not make the way things are right and I am sure there are ways to have good competition while still rewarding first movers who invest in the infrastructure but right now this is the way it is in a lot of areas.

The big disrupter in the US has been fiber to the curb offerings like Verizon's FiOS service which provides a new data pipe and allows the customer to have a choice over cable. Any area where VZW has FiOS there is actual competition in rates and service. However like any other land-line technology it is expensive to deploy and getting the necessary rights of way in various towns across the country can be difficult. For example Verzion has stopped deployments in many states due to towns denying right's of way at the request of the incumbent providers. 

So as dubious as it might seem, there is a good chance the OP's problem is legit and may not be something easy to get an alternative provider. ",t1_c119aum,1286126616,Manitcor,t5_2qh17

If you do that, and actually embrace what you call ""schizophrenia"" - you might not be able to find your way back to a normal life very easily. 

More important even than smooth thinking, is holding fast to a very earnest ethic of how you form your conclusions about the world. The european philosophers of history understood it very well that people form their conceptions about the world, and then live within that frame of reference. Reality is not self-evident - but rather we create a sense of reality through drawing conclusions about the world. Interestingly enough, in the USA, this idea of reasoning about the world - instead of expecting it to present itself at face value - is a totally foreign concept. In Australia and Britain and other English-speaking countries, the art of reasoning is expected to be much more a part of everyday life for people.

Before we had universal male suffrage in America, only men who owned property could vote. This wasn't so much of a problem at first because land was in such abundance, but soon whole populations of men were deprived of the right to vote because there was an influx of European immigrants who began to concentrate in cities, where they didn't own any land. So they fought for the right to vote, just like blacks and women did. The [Dorr rebellion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorr_Rebellion) is an extreme example of this.

*When we talk about government debt, it about much the government spends compared to how much it takes in in taxes. 
*When we talk about current account deficits, we are talking about total imports minus exports.

Look at this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Current_Account_Balance_%25_GDP_2006.PNG

It shows that Southern and Eastern Europe have some issues, but the larger economies do not. In fact Germany has a larger surplus than China.

Furthermore, have a current account deficit could simply mean that there is a lot of foreign investment going on, as opposed to runaway spending and low savings rates which are the reason for American deficits. The deficits of the Asian Tigers in the 70s and 80s are examples of this.

In short, this may not mean what you think it does. Buying government debt is not the same thing as buying the country.",t3_dm3jq,1286128671,Barney21,t5_2qh13

I remember reading this case study in my international marketing class in business school as a major backfire for Nestle, otherwise before a pretty well respected brand. This is one side of the story, the other side of the story is not quite as evil. Nestle formula was selling well in developed nations, the marketers in charge of the formula brand were tasked with expanding into Asian markets. The thing is many people at Nestle did believe that their formula was a healthy and safe alternative to breast feeding (this was the 1970s). Tasked with trying to sell into a new market, the executives in charge based on market research decided to expand where their formula could be used best, where sometimes breast feeding isn't always an option: into hospitals. This technique proved to be successful so they expanded that effort into doctors offices and hospitals throughout Asia. 

However, this took a life of it's own, and soon mothers everywhere believed that they had to use formula, that it was safer than breast feeding. It's what they use in hospitals, so it has to be right thing to do for my baby, right? Nestle executives were thrilled with the huge success of the formula so they kept on selling it, buying more advertising, promoting how great and safe their formula was (Doctors use it, so should you!). Of course they didn't take in consideration that third water supplies are not like they are in the west. In Asia they didn't have to follow any sort of FDA guidelines, which meant shortcuts in the manufacturing process to keep up with demand. Soon, babies starting dying everywhere and Nestle is the most evil company in the world. Last thing you want your company to be known for is killing babies, which is exactly what happened with Nestle's aggressive expansion and ill-researched marketing strategy. To this day, there are major boycotts of the Nestle brand throughout the world and they have lost major market share in most of Europe. This was a case study of the dangers of expanding your product internationally without taking in regional living conditions and culture. 

TL;DR: if your going to sell a new product, in a country you've never sold before, make sure it doesn't kill babies. ",t3_dm7ic,1286129726,robotevil,t5_6

This is a reasonable indicator to me that as a society we have no problem with laws regarding levels of dress, and that this is not simply about dress standards or freedom of speech, but something else.

Whether or not the state should tell what you can't or cannot wear is EXACTLY what we are debating right now. And it's a load of horseshit that European societies have no problems with laws of dress - where were you in the 70's and 80's? Ever heard of long-haired hippies, or punkers with 'FUCK' written on their backs. Unlike you, people were actually able to accept that freedom should triumph, even though they considered that completely anti-social wear. And even if it wasn't so, just because 'we as a society' believe something doesn't make it right in any way whatsoever. 

&gt;No, and as above, you lead me to my next point: it isn't about clothing, or offending fashion sensibility. It's about ideals, and what we as a society consider acceptable. We don't consider nudity acceptable, and we don't consider clothing that exists to hide you from public view and anonymise you as acceptable. We don't accept either the motivation or the ramifications of such an item of clothing - that women should not be seen, let alone heard.

What the fuck do you mean by 'we'? I sure as shit don't count as we, and neither do nudists, muslims, or anyone who likes freedom. And why should you decide what is appropriate motivations for wearing clothing?

&gt;When did being a pussy in the face of people that seek to oppress and minoritise women become standard in Europe? That's the real question.

Do you honestly, for a second, believe that by BANNING women from wearing a piece of clothing you are helping them from oppressors? Freedom is Slavery eh? 
You're not advocating making it illegal to force women to wear certain clothes (which is already illegal), you are advocating keeping them from choosing what they should wear. ",t1_c119cy2,1286129983,Liberaloccident,t5_2qh13

He doesn't actually do that. He points to the inefficiency of the Japanese domestic market as the reason for $75 melons, with the weak yen only as an ancillary factor:

*And the shrunken share of economic spoils that did end up in the hands of consumers had no outlet but the **heavily protected domestic market with its hopelessly inefficient** and shockingly overpriced goods and services. When American humorist Dave Barry traveled to Japan in 1991, he was stunned to find department stores selling $75 melons.*

I think you misunderstood or didn't read the article. The points he made were these:

1. That Japan was heavily focused on its exports, and in order to maintain exports they artificially weakened their currency.
2. That a weak currency decreases the purchasing power of Japanese citizens, and therefore depresses the domestic market.
3. That the domestic market was then artificially propped up by government through protectionism and subsidies.
4. And therefore, the domestic market became inefficient and non-competitive.

The story about the melon prices was not to show what an expensive place Japan was. Other commodities, such as rice or fish or other staples of the Japanese diet might have been quite affordable. They must have been, because Japanese salaries certainly weren't high enough that average people could have even survived, if **all** food was as overpriced as the melons.

The purpose of the story was to show the inefficiencies of the domestic economy. He was pointing out that the domestic economy survived because of subsidies and protectionism, and that while it worked great for items that were actually controlled such as staple foods, some ridiculous item like melons could escape through the chinks of oversight, and then you would see how pathetic the domestic economy *really* was.

It is just an anecdote. Perhaps there were other reasons too, crop failures, some melon pest, whatever. But the US is not immune from crop failures or pests either, nor is western Europe. When stuff like this happens, we import from somewhere else, and we get a good price, because our currency isn't hugely deflated and our laws don't try to protect our internal markets by imposing stupendous tariffs on imports. I'm not saying we don't have our own subsidies and our own tariffs, but it is a difference of *degree*, of *how much* subsidy and protectionism is needed to allow your domestic market to survive.

This is the stuff the article is talking about, if you take the trouble to read it. They are pointing out that when the US forced Japan to upvalue the Yen, the idea was that the resulting drop in Japanese exports would be made up by increased domestic demand in Japan itself. This is a natural expectation. After all, if your dollar is suddenly worth more, your buying power increases and you can buy more stuff. The same goes for the Yen.

But this did not happen in Japan. The domestic economy failed to take up the slack. The people did not start buying more goods. So the money had to find another home, and it found it in real estate and stocks, which led to the bubble. Japan is still recovering from the crash of that bubble.

The article asks **why** the domestic economy didn't take up the slack. They say it's because you can't magically improve one sector of your economy simply by decreeing it from up top. The decades during which the domestic economy was depressed by the artificially low exchange rate took their toll. The domestic economy faltered, grew inefficient, which required more government intervention to fix, in the form of subsidies and protectionism.

So it was in this sad state that the domestic economy was suddenly asked to grow instantly and rapidly to take up the slack of decreasing exports and a higher exchange rate. It failed to do that. This is pretty much all that the author is saying. ",t1_c118ha7,1286130416,xenofon,t5_2qh13

Several years ago somebody told me we were in a gold bubble because gold was trading around $500/oz.   So I went back and looked at the debt in the US economy, looked at the size of government, taxes, and growth, and promptly decided to buy some more gold.    

Well, the debt and economic fundamentals of both the USA and Europe have gotten a lot worse in the last few years, not better.  It's no wonder that gold is going through the roof.   

Maybe people don't like gold as a currency, but it's not like one day the market decided that gold was shit, and to use dollars only.   Gold was taken off the dollar by government edict.  And at the time $35 dollars could buy an ounce of gold, but today it takes $1200.   To me that looks more like a dollar collapse than a gold bubble.  

When government spending starts to decline, and government debt starts to decline, and the amount of money/credit in circulation starts to decline, then calling gold a bubble as it still goes up in price is fair gain.   Till then, it's bullshit.

Have a look at this:

&gt; From 1941 to 1944, Pope Pius and the Catholic Church were responsible for saving more Jews from Nazi persecution than any other person or institution. Some Israeli scholars estimate that as many as 860,000 European Jews were saved from death through concealment in Church facilities, issuance of fake Baptismal certificates, public appeals and other methods.

Even so, I say the first mistake is going for a guitar with built in electronics (really, I don't know anyone, except street artists, who actually needs one). To me, it's basically slapped on so the sellers can more easily screw over the newbies. These days, so many guitars come with electronics, though. A lot of good ones too.

The point is: just get a good acoustic guitar. Forget the electronics. If you're a novice, why are you even bothering with it in the first place? You're not touring, and if you did, the rubbish that guitars come with doesn't compare with a microphone, or even a Fishman (for instance). If you're recording, that means you've already spent some (relatively) real money on an audio interface (and probably a microphone). If you're just recording to remember things or analyze your playing (i.e. sound quality is not important), then you can use anything. Use your cellphone. Or just get a cheap external recorder.

In short, I just really dislike acoustic guitars that come with electronics. For newbies, it makes rubbish guitars seem good (plugging them into an amp is a surefire way of making a sale), and it's pretty useless for anyone who might have had any use for it (if it wasn't rubbish).

So, yeah. I would rather have gone with cheaper North-American guitars (like a Simon and Patrick, or another Godin), or a good but cheap Eastern European guitar (like Furch, pretty sure they have some cheaper models). Depending on where you live, of course.

I loathe Yamaha guitars. I guess I'm just put off by the scores of black Yamaha guitars (cut-away) with electronics being sold. Looks over sound. No soul. Never tried any Yamaha I really enjoyed the sound of, and I find they are expensive for the sound they give (the build quality is high, though). I would say Takamine is a much better choice, in general. Still, haven't been too impressed with their cheaper guitars either. I guess both brands make OK guitars if you up your budget. Which brings me to my next point.

In general I would say that $250 isn't anywhere enough to buy an acoustic guitar worth a damn. I would recommend saving up some more money. In my opinion, around $500 is a minimum. Any less, and you'll be buying a guitar that is pretty much worthless when/if you decide to sell it to fund a purchase of a better guitar; not to mention you won't be having as much fun playing (and you can't use it for any recording, if you're getting into that). A lot of people say start out small, I say fuck that. Bad guitars sound awful. $100 ""learning guitars"" have probably killed off more potential guitar heroes than anything else.

The Dark Ages is only that part of the Middle Ages that involves the cultural and social stagnation that immediately followed the fall of Rome.

Secondly, academies were well-established institutions even by the Middle Ages; the first academy was founded hundred of years BC by Plato at a place near Athens actually called 'Akademia'.

Thirdly, it turns out you were mistaken about the uniqueness of the European Dark Age; the Byzantine Empire did indeed have a Dark Age; I didn't know this before but stumbled across the fact that the Byzantine Empire experienced a Dark Age of hundreds of years of cultural stagnation following a large-scale Muslim invasion it experienced.

A Swedish friend of mine had an interesting hypothesis about why the US can assimilate Muslim immigrants.  Life is hard in the US.  If you're an immigrant you're working two jobs and barely getting by.  You're concentrating on how to pay your bills and ensure your children will have a better life.  You have no time to think of politics or the like.  European countries are much more generous.  Europeans don't work as much.  They have more time to think, to think about how society is excluding them or whatever.  No matter how wealthy a Muslim becomes in Europe, most likely they will still  be ""othered.""  In the US money speaks.  If an American Muslim can rise to the middle class his children will be accepted into American society.  So they work hard to get into that class.

* Your files are available from any computer. It doesn't matter if you are at home, at work, at school, using your laptop or your workstation. Your files are always there.

* Version control makes it possible to undelete deleted files, as well as restore a file to an earlier version. This have saved my ass countless times.

* Collaborative file storage lets you and your friends / colleagues access the same files from different computers. Sweet!

The cons:

* No selective sharing. If you sync your porn folder to dropbox, you better be prepared for it to sync to your office computer. Hopefully this will be added soonish.

* Too large jump between different sizes. Free account is 2GB, Pro 50 is 50GB, Pro 100 is 100GB. I don't need 50 - I need 20.

* Somewhat slow syncing from northern europe.

THE HAGUE - Terrorism expert Edwin Bakker of the Clingendael Institute is adamant: warnings as the U.S. and Britain now provide to their citizens, there could be attacks in Europe are actually meaningless.

""What to do as a citizen? That warning is so general, citizens can't do anything with it."" Bakker calls the warning ""unwise"". He has the idea that it is particularly designed to cover themselves in case something should happen. ""Probably they know something, but the information is not specific enough to focus the action. And as long as you do not have that information but nevertheless issue a warning, one only plays into the hands of terrorists.

I’ve never been to Pakistan, but I have been to Afghanistan.  After being there a while I started to remember all those castles I saw along the Rhein river in Germany while I was there.  You could literally stand at one castle and see another.  Their territories were that close together.  Afghanistan is a lot like that today, but without the castles.  There are a lot of these little villages that are rather small.  We’re talking 40 to 100 people in them.  Little villages are common, and the larger ones (still only a couple hundred people) are more rare.  These little villages are in their own little world.  Sure, we here in the western world all group them together into Afghanistan or Pakistan, but they don’t associate themselves with anything more than their own little area.  These little villages also have longtime rivalries.  These people are great at keeping a grudge, and so there’s a lot of conflict among the villages from time to time about things we’d consider trivial.  I remember that we used to “buy in” with those little portable generators you can buy at auto parts stores.  I know people here in the States who want to be “off the grid”.   The people way out there never have had a grid.

The reason I told you all that is that I don’t think the media really tells people the whole story.  There was just a big terror related operation in Europe that stopped something from happening, then not surprisingly, there were several strikes made by our birds along the border of Pakistan.  It would seem likely to me that actionable intel was acquired and Secretary Gates took it to the President to move on it.  The President was the one that ordered those strikes.  He gave his thumbs up to them because he was told that whomever was being blown up, was worth the “blowback”.  

Most of these areas out there are off in their own little worlds.  They have their allegiances and they are rarely to the nation they happen to reside in.  Pakistan is making a big issue out of this because they don’t want to be seen failing to handle their own business.

I never proposed to oppress anybody or impose my beliefs on anybody. In fact, I live in a secular society and I happen to think it's the greatest country in the world, but to you, it doesn't matter. Anybody that even wants to live as a Muslim is a threat to you. To you, they are all subversive, insidious revolutionaries waiting to happen. To you, there is no legitimate religious practice for the Muslim. You even mock their ""brother""hood, denying them even the most basic sense of community.

Most Muslim people just want to be left alone to practice their religion. They want to be able to participate in public life without being forced to  conform to a norm. For example, a woman should be able to win an elected seat in parliament without being booed and hissed at by people elected by people like you simply because she chooses to wear a traditional head scarf in a government building.


You know what's really ironic? In your pathetically desperate desire to ""appear"" European, you missed the most basic aspects of Europe that are actually worth emulating - liberty, independence, freedom from oppression. The secularist factions within modern Turkey are, in practice, today's oppressors. They cite  some tenuous vague threat from religion and then seek to stamp it out.

You may have European clothing and European music, but you have a human rights record like any other fascist middle-eastern country.

We *are* primates.

People have always had an enormous capacity to make distinctions between ""us"" (real people, the favored of God or the gods), and ""them"" (semi-humans, barbarians, agents of the devil).

Even within the last few hundred years, the colonial settlers used to hunt the Indians in South America and Aborigines in Australia like animals (literally), and we would say that those groups are *obviously* people.

(On the other hand, some early European explorers referred to Orangutans and African apes as ""wild people"".)

So, if hominids other than *Homo sapiens* had been known to historic civilizations, some people might have considered them ""primitive people"" and others ""humanlike animals"" - and I suppose somebody might have insisted that they were an intermediate form. 

This probably wouldn't have made much of a difference in early people's perception of evolution, because anybody who's comfortable thinking of other animals as ""our relatives"" does so anyway, whereas other people reject the notion that we could possibly be ""related to animals"".

And just to give you a couple of things to think about - it's been proposed that the *nephilim* mentioned in the Bible *were* surviving non-*sapiens* hominids in the ancient Middle East. I think that this is extremely speculative but I wouldn't rule it out entirely.

Yes, I believe it is a good thing.  While I am hugely in favor of limiting bureaucratic crap that is inter-regional/international to a given set of major common languages (primary among them, sorry France, being English) for pure cost and practicality reasons, there is no reason to force-translate everything in every EU country into Maltese.  But places like Holland or Scandinavia show that it is possible for a population to be well capable of communicating effectively and fluently in an outside language, while still maintaining their own.  It need not be a barrier unless your political and educational systems make it one.

Given that, lots of languages is a good thing.  First, it allows you to have culturally specific views on different topics.  German, English, French, and Spanish each have colloquialisms and idioms that do not translate into others, but which can effectively express sentiments, phenomena, ideas, etc. in particular ways that cannot easily be expressed in other languages.  

Next, national/sociopolitical history is an important element of any cultural group.  This is strongly intertwined with regional languages.  Asking any linguistic or cultural group to give this up is equivalent to asking them to integrate to more than a reasonable degree.

Last, linguistic diversity is an interesting thing in its own right.  One of the weaknesses of the EU, IMHO, is that it tries to force certain standards on countries for which they might not be appropriate (note that I'm not questioning it as a whole, just in some of its more detailed aspects.)

Wikipedia isn't a source, but it is useful as a tertiary resource, so I quote from the article [slavery in the United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States):

&gt; The transformation from indentured servitude to racial slavery happened gradually. There were no laws regarding slavery early in Virginia's history. However, by 1640, the Virginia courts had sentenced at least one black servant to slavery.

The tradition starts with ""indentured servitude"" -- usually a temporary condition, not hereditary, for European descended people. Then it morphs into the creation of a perpetual slave class defined by race, through various court decisions.

However, what Beck is eliding is that those court decisions did not create these practices; they *codified* them into law. People were already engaged in the slave trade and all of its horrors before the courts got involved.

Court precedents involving slavery are well known to evangelicals, since nowadays they invoke them with regards to the abortion question. They feel there is a direct analogy between slaves and fetuses, where the courts decide Dred Scott is not entitled to constitutional protection. So keep in mind that's the set of ideas Beck is invoking -- the fear that government can define you not to be a real person. 

Whether or not Beck is being straight with his viewers, it is good for liberals to remember that the courts and the government are not always the friend of the oppressed. 

And, I actually agree that the current plans the US has for universal health care do raise issues that touch on individual rights. The notion that citizens are forced to buy insurance from an private supplier, without any ""public option"" or default universal insurance, is rather shocking. But Beck of course thinks of the health care debate as being about Socialism, when what's really going down is the exact opposite.",t3_dm8xo,1286142171,neilk,t5_2cneq

I don't think that was a bad approach, and I don't see anything wrong with educating your kids, but I also think it's kind of absurd to introduce your child to that so young. And with actual dildos *holy shit*.

I mean, when I was that age I didn't know how sex worked at all, or even what a penis looked like- my life was just TV and first grade and kittens and best friends. I didn't actually know what sex/penises looked like until I was what, 11? 12? Now, I don't think your approach of introducing kids to sex would have hurt me at all, but I also don't think it's something that I really would have needed to think about.

Then again, my reservations about this could just be culturally-instilled in me (moderate-liberal USA). I mean, in certain European countries, young children are taught about safe sex, etc, and it's not really considered a big deal, there is social acceptance and support mechanisms, etc. I mean, that's best, right? I, too, think sex is not something to be ashamed/proud of as long as we're all educated about it. So as weird as you are, I think it's possible that you are one of the most amazing parents out there.

Diesel gets better mileage largely because it is a denser fuel - it contains about 20% more energy per volume. 

That said, I do think Diesel is great, I just don't think it will ever dominate in the USA in personal cars. Hybrid and electric cars are a more realistic future. 

edit: if you have a subscription to the Economist, they do an interesting analysis here: http://www.economist.com/node/10984681?story_id=10984681

some relevant text:

&gt;So, two decades after vanishing in a puff of smoke, diesels seem poised to reappear on the American landscape. Your correspondent will be among the first to plonk down his cash the moment diesel versions of family runabouts arrive. But he wonders where all the fuel will come from if Americans take to diesels as much as they’ve embraced hybrids.

&gt;Fact is, there’s a global shortage of the stuff. That’s why, shorn of tax breaks, diesel costs so much more than petrol. Over the past year, the average price of diesel in America has risen by 117%—twice as fast as petrol. While both carry the same taxes in America, diesel now costs 60 to 70 cents a gallon more than regular gas.

&gt;With spring in the air, factories, office, stores and homes in the chillier northern half of America will have started to turn down their oil-fired heating systems. Meanwhile, farmers and truckers (big users both of diesel fuel) are in the midst of their slackest season of the year. Couple that with an economy that’s lurching towards recession, and you would be excused for thinking the price of diesel—which comes from the same part of the barrel as heating oil—would now be falling.

&gt;Actually, if anything, it’s continuing to rise. That’s because of the burgeoning demand from Europe, China and India.

&gt;It doesn’t help that the catalytic crackers used by oil refineries in America are optimised to produce as much petrol as possible—typically about 50% of every barrel. Diesel accounts for only 15% of the rest, with the balance used to produce heating oil, jet fuel, heavy fuel, liquid petroleum gas, asphalt and other products.

&gt;Refineries in Europe and elsewhere tend to use hydrocrackers that produce 25% petrol and 25% diesel. They would like to produce more diesel than they currently do, but that would mean producing even more petrol than they need. At present, they export their surplus to America.

&gt;So, if America switched to diesel cars in a big way, the Europeans would be even more awash in unwanted petrol than they are today, and might have to dump it elsewhere or even idle some refinery capacity. Either way, the global price of diesel would soar still further.

&gt;Meanwhile, back at the pump in America, diesel currently costs 20% more per gallon than regular petrol. When that premium reaches 35%, the difference in fuel efficiency will equal the difference in price—and there will be no economic reason to make the switch. Some reckon that day is only a few years away.",t1_c11a5rb,1286144955,rm999,t5_mouw

Intro:
-----

After high school you go to the army and when you get out you're excited to finally be free and you're poor because the army pays like 70USD a month.  From here there are two options: go to university (5-10k USD for a year), go travel (like O.E. in Aus/NZ, $500USD/mo).

Both cost a lot compared to what a 20-year-old has so most go work.  The money to be made in the USA and Europe is much easier but riskier than in Israel.  Relative to Israelis, Americans give money away.  A lot of young people try to get a visa to go to the USA.  The embassy tries to filter them out but many make it through.

The jobs:
---------

**Carts:** Little booths in the mall walkway where Israelis sell paintings, potpourri-scented pillows, massage stuff, etc.  The booth workers don't make dick but they aren't paying income tax so not too bad for them.  I knew a guy that worked his way up and had 200 employees, a supplier for carts in malls around the country.  At age 22/23 he made some $250,000USD in a year or two.  He didn't pay taxes either.  I'm still jealous.  If you feel that an eye-mask that smells like tea is worth $10USD then go ahead and buy it.  No one stole your money but you could have haggled.

**Door-to-door:** Mostly just the paintings.  This one is in Europe, too, especially Amsterdam.  Like the carts, it isn't really a scam except that the artist might not be the starving student that you imagine.  If you like the painting no matter who painted it and the price is right, I don't see the problem.

**Movers:** This is the big money for the boys.  Bust your ass for up to a year.  Sleep in the moving van while on the road to save cash.  These guys can make $6000USD a month (not paying taxes, again) and the boss is doing even better.  Eventually they learn that they can get to the destination and say, ""Oh, you've got stairs?  That'll be another $2000.""  Now your shit is hostage in their truck.  Even Israelis living in the USA don't use Israeli movers.  If you get stuck, say that you've called the police and the INS.  Have police show up.  Ask to speak to the boss, talk about deportation and tax fraud.  You might get your move at a discount.

My family knows a guy that ran some movers.  All of the kids got their passports blacklisted from visiting the USA again and deported.  The boss went to prison for a year or two.

**Au pair:** Mostly girls.  The Israelis that moved to the USA went there for the chance to make big money.  This gives the USA a skewed Israeli population because not all Israelis are chasing after dollars and America but the ones there are.  So you've got Israeli families, both parents work, and someone has to stay home to watch the kids.  Preferably speaking Hebrew.  Au pair lives or rents a flat with her au pair friends and ekes out a living.  Cost of living and shopping usually mean she doesn't save much anyway.

**tl;dr**: Except for the movers, most of it is ""caveat emptor"".  Try not to be dumb with your money.",t3_dm99n,1286146356,eyal0,t5_2cneq

From what I hear, ease of getting a work visa depends largely on the field of work and the country. For instance: I am moving to Germany from America soon, and I have several friends over there who said they had no problem whatsoever getting a work visa. Also, you can try a couple other ways to work around this (which the consulate offices will help you with) 1) If you are going to be working as an intern they are much more lenient about giving out visas. 2) You can apply to go to a school in that country, sign up for 1 class (which will be very cheap because Europe is awesome), this way you can go on a student visa instead of a work visa and get a job that pays ""under the table"". You can also do something similar with a visiting visa.

Point being: Don't rule out Europe because of possible problems with obtaining a visa, you have no way of knowing how hard it is to get the visa without trying, and their economy is doing pretty well so I don't see why they wouldn't let you go if you already had a job lined up. Consulate offices are very helpful with this stuff, you can talk to them about your situation and see what they advise you to do. No country is trying to STOP you from going there, they are just trying to help their citizens before helping foreigners.

EDIT: to get a work visa in most EU countries you need a job already lined up. This just means getting your employer over there to write you a letter stating they intend to hire you when you move there. For any work visa, you will need a job already.

If someone inherits most of their wealth from a long line of ancestors then I can see how the children may be said to have some sort of vested interest in this familial line.  Another benefit of this law in the European sense is that it forces the family to treat all children equally so that they cannot concentrate the wealth by giving it all to the oldest son.  This helps to dilute these family fortunes while at the same time making sure that the children are not completely disinherited from their line's wealth.

In America where fortunes are predominately self made this law would probably not fit nearly as well.  Since the spirit here is that you have to earn your own keep forcing the family to give the children assets free and clear would probably only create spoiled lay-abouts(though maybe this is all that the rich are in Europe, I don't know because I don't live there).

Once western Europe got it's hands on some ancient writings, such as Aristotle, in the 11th and 12th Centuries there was an explosion in learning. The people who read these works were monks, like Peter Abelard, as they were the only literate class. Christianity may have done many things wrong, but it did not knowingly or willfully destroy and bury these works. From the 12th Century onwards we see the founding of universities in Europe. Many of these were born out of the cathedral schools, where monks and clerks (from the original cleric) were trained and educated. 

From the acceptance and willingness to learn from 'heathen' works in the late Middle Ages, it seems that Christianity was not totally averse to the works.

The practice of beer battering is popular in America, Europe, Russia, and the Middle-East.""

The dark ages in europe are primarily brought on by the decline of the roman empire (which was christian by that point by and large).

And while it is true that some classical ideas and literature were saved by other cultures.  It is also true that much of that inforation survives because it was kept by christians - who maintained (more than anyone else) key abilities such as literacy and employed monks as scribes.

A religion is a set of beliefs. As you noted, there is no scientific proof that there is a deity. What you elect to forget is that there is no scientific proof for a [scientific theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory) as well. A scientific theory is a falsifiable set of consistent assertions. Due to [underdetermination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underdetermination), we will always need a set of unproven assertions on which to base our science.

&gt; Do you think that there's a supernatural deity which interfers in human affairs (like answering prayers?)

I do. If you want objective evidence you have to tell me what kind of experience you are willing to use, and thus what set of pre-assumptions you are having about such a deity. It is quite probable that your tests are not acceptable to me.

&gt; Is there any possible physical mechanism consistent with what we know about science.

If you mean _consistent_ then yes, they are. Specially given that all your science is probabilistic from the quantum level upwards.

&gt; For even more specific example, how is the concept of a 'soul', common to many religions, consistent with our understanding of neurobiology and how our conciousness is simply a result of vast and complex electro-chemical interactions?

I am not an expert in neurobiology, but do you have any scientific result in neurobiology that contradicts the existence of a 'soul'? If not, you are in the same situation as me. You just believe that your set of beliefs is inherently better than mine.

&gt; However, unlike science, religion doesn't have a single shred of evidence. Also, there are multiple widely differing religions which exists at the same time, are contradictory, and are also evolving.

Couple of points here. First, I am not arguing that all religions are correct. Just as I am not arguing that your set of beliefs are correct. Each religion should be defended by its own followers, and I am not responsible for any perceived contradictions of Christianity, nor they are responsible for mine.

Secondly, science at the moment has this problem at its basis at well. If you base your beliefs on the ascendency of physics you must be perturbed by the number of contradictory interpretations of quantum mechanics. You probably shouldn't believe in String theory as well, as it is less falsifiable at the moment than many religions.

&gt; Well, in my personal opinion, religion is very much a part of the problem, because it tells people to believe in things based simply on faith instead of applying reason, logic and evidence.

I leave you with two points:

1. Please read [Believing the Axioms](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/belaxioms1.pdf), a respectable paper by Penelope Maddy (a UCI Distinguished Professor of Logic and Philosophy of Science and of Mathematics at the University of California, Irvine). This is a good argument about why we believe the axioms and where they come from. There is nothing ""self-evident"" about your set of beliefs that supports science. You chose to believe them. If a religious person can get to the same scientific results based on his set of beliefs then your beliefs are not superior.

2. Huge developments in the [scientific method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_scientific_method) were done in the Islamic Golden Age (by Ibn al-Haytham and others) and were supported by the religious establishment. This is in contrast to the struggle between science and the church in Europe.

Listening to his clip that's not at all what I heard him imply.

His use of the language ""It started small, and it started with seemingly innocent ideas..."" implied that at one point in time all that existed was nice, safe, innocent indentured servitude (and not the indentured servitude that actually existed), and that the slave trade in all of its horrors did not even exist until the regulations compounded.

Hence his comparison of the modern day healthcare system to the slave trade of old: we had a perfectly innocent and fine system (that was his stance during the debates, that it wasn't broken) and all the regulations will result in a horrific system *just like how the slave trade system came about*.

&gt;One view, first propounded by Enlightenment philosophers, asserts that the Church's doctrines are entirely superstitious and have hindered the progress of civilization. Communist states have made similar arguments in their education and propaganda in order to inculcate a negative view of Catholicism (and religion in general) in their citizens. The most famous incidents cited by such critics are the Church's condemnations of the teachings of Copernicus, Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler.

&gt;In opposition to this view, some historians of science, including non-Catholics such as J.L. Heilbron, A.C. Crombie, David Lindberg, Edward Grant, Thomas Goldstein, and Ted Davis, have argued that the Church had a significant, positive influence on the development of Western civilization. They hold that, **not only did monks save and cultivate the remnants of ancient civilization during the barbarian invasions, but that the Church promoted learning and science through its sponsorship of many universities which, under its leadership, grew rapidly in Europe in the 11th and 12th centuries. St.Thomas Aquinas, the Church's ""model theologian,"" argued that reason is in harmony with faith, and that reason can contribute to a deeper understanding of revelation, and so encouraged intellectual development.** The Church's priest-scientists, many of whom were Jesuits, have been among the leading lights in astronomy, genetics, geomagnetism,meteorology, seismology, and solar physics, becoming some of the ""fathers"" of these sciences. Examples include important churchmen such as the Augustinian abbot Gregor Mendel (pioneer in the study of genetics), Roger Bacon (a Franciscan friar who was one of the early advocates of the scientific method), and Belgian priest Georges Lemaître (the first to propose the Big Bang theory). Other notable priest scientists have included Albertus Magnus, Robert Grosseteste, Nicholas Steno, Francesco Grimaldi, Giambattista Riccioli, Roger Boscovich, and Athanasius Kircher. Even more numerous are Catholic laity involved in science:Henri Becquerel who discovered radioactivity; Galvani, Volta, Ampere, Marconi, pioneers in electricityand telecommunications; Lavoisier, ""father of modern chemistry""; Vesalius, founder of modern human anatomy; and Cauchy, one of the mathematicians who laid the rigorous foundations of calculus.",t1_c11aj3b,1286161518,mcsquare,t5_2qh2p

You honestly need a better plan other than ""help me get to another rich country"".  If you have no blood ties (close relatives that lived in other country), a lot of money, or very specialized skills, you are going to have to work hard indeed to get out.

One note about ""Europe"" is that it is really quite a lot of countries with very unique host cultures and languages.  If you move anywhere in Western Europe, start working on the host language of your desired country *NOW*.  Unless you're going to England or Ireland, the English language makes you an outsider.

First target a region that you like the most.  If you don't LOVE the country you're about to move to, your adventure will be short lived as living in a foreign country day to day requires you to completely reboot your life and start it over.  You will tuck tail and run as the grind of daily life and possibly a foreign language and culture take their tolls.  If you haven't already, travel as much as humanly possible to see the world and hopefully fall in love with a place where you can become a native of that culture.  Research the laws and cultures of your adopted homeland to death.

Once you have targeted your host region, look at what skills are most in demand in that region, and try to figure out what specialties you have been trained and schooled in will fit that jobs list.  Most countries do have a desired skills/jobs list, you better read them.  Tailor your resume to show your strengths in your chosen/wanted position.  Then you can begin the arduous task of going hat in hand and sending out resumes on the internet.  If you have no residency for your targeted country, employers are going to view you as an unloved smelly fish so you really better have a perfect CV -- you have converted your resume to a CV already, right?  If not, start looking into what the host country wants in a CV.

You sound young, but that is ok.. really the best time to move.  But get some travel under your belt and focus.  Focus focus focus, or you'll just be seen for the naive, unwashed, uncultured youth that you are, and your dreams will go nowhere.  Sorry if this advice seems a little unstructured, but I'm having to paint on a bit of a blank canvas here.

France was an industrial, urban nation while the United States (Which were much more of a confederation of states rather then a single nation) was a rural, farming area, comparing the two is comparing apples and oranges.  Of course the two had separate goals and roads to realizing those goals. 

That being said, the American revolution was directly responsible (in some small way, of course, not the main reason) for inspiring the people of France to revolution against their hierarchies, and the wording of Frances bill of rights and revolutionary documents often borrowed from American sources (in turn who were often inspired by the French)  There is a reason that Thomas Paine found such a voice in America.

America was not a ""Cess pool"" as was often reported, it was decentralized and sprawling, with no military or federal bank,  and it was made that way by design, as it was fitting for the area at the time.  Americans had total freedom of speech, freedom of the press and right to arm themselves.  Newspaper subscriptions were ridiculously high, and the nation on a whole was politically aware and active.  They were the first to successfully overthrow a European hierarchy and were often resented for it, the belief being that their blind devotion to ""Classical Liberalism"" were unfounded and ridiculous.  And thus news reports (which had to go through the state first, before they could be published) were often heavily biased against them.  The notable exception of course, being France. edit: Oh fuck, dont forget the separation of church and state, that was pretty big too.

And I am an Anarchist!  Please, leave your ignorance and bias at the door when you come into /r/history. 

as an aside, it is silly to say the French were a bastion of hope for all peoples, as they continued to hold about a half dozen colonies around the world, exploiting entire countries in a way that is not considered slavery for some reason, but really is.

What is Neoliberalism?

""""Neo-liberalism"" is a set of economic policies that have become widespread during the last 25 years or so. Although the word is rarely heard in the United States, you can clearly see the effects of neo-liberalism here... as the rich grow richer and the poor grow poorer.

""Liberalism"" can refer to political, economic, or even religious ideas. In the U.S. political liberalism has been a strategy to prevent social conflict. It is presented to poor and working people as progressive compared to conservative or Rightwing. Economic liberalism is different. Conservative politicians who say they hate ""liberals"" -- meaning the political type -- have no real problem with economic liberalism, including neoliberalism.""

The people demanded more government, and the factions wrestled with the gun in the room.  A war broke out and the victor was not the northern states, but a single state: the US.  Centralization increased again.  Trouble in Europe in the 20th century led to increase centralization.  First the WWs, then the cold war.  Each new threat made the government grow.  Now the latest threat, the war on terror, is making the government grow extremely quickly?  How has a real, but relatively minor, threat created such a response?  How come people can't take pictures of government buildings or take nail clippers on planes?  The reason that the government was able to grow so quickly is that the threat is within our borders.  The planes that hit the towers took off from Boston.  Internal threats are more stressful, more guaranteed to attack us rather than someone else.

The result is that a threat that people worry about, however small, will result in the growth of government  Having two security forces trying to arbitrate in one region would definitely cause stress and result in the quick growth of government.",t1_c11b1xz,1286167289,hello_good_sir,t5_2qh63

then i started taking classes in the city and i couldn't exactly get a ride every day so i would take the train in. i still had no idea where i was going and would miss my stop all the time, but i eventually figured it out.

now it's 4 years later and i don't ever ask for directions, just thought i'd share some tips.



-STOP RELYING ON FRIENDS AND FAMILY.
they won't always be there

-start paying attention whenever you go somewhere with someone else. look for landmarks and street names

-use public transportation
it goes places people usually want to be and its a lot easier than walking. this is really important in philly and europe where they have plenty of trains and busses

-figure out what way is north and how to orient yourself
maps don't always have north at the top, it doesn't help anybody if you figure out where you want to be and then start walking the opposite direction

-MAKE MISTAKES
actually just learn from your mistakes. you won't forget after you miss your stop for the third time

-relax, be confident
just because you feel lost doesn't mean you are.
look around you, there are street signs
you have a GPS and cities were built to be orderly

-don't be afraid to ask for help
but try asking someone who might know what they're talking about. cops and the transit authority know where things are

-Plan a route.
figure out where you are in relation to where you want to be and decide on a simple way to get there before you leave

-If you're taking public transportation make sure you have money or a pass. 
all the direction in the world can't help you if you're stranded 

Just try it. i can't tell you how satisfying it is to be somewhere you've never been and get home under your own power without help from the people you are used to relying on. all the sudden the entire world opens up to you and you can go anywhere!",t3_dmgj0,1286168108,deathsheep,t5_2qh1i

I got busted when I called up a friend of mine in my hometown the week before heading back to school.  It was like 3am when I pick her up, and we drive to a mildly secluded area in her neighborhood, sit on the sidewalk, burn one, and chat.  It was reckless because it was outside in suburbia, and someone called the cops on us.  Two cruisers roll up, and basically had us dead to rights.  I feel bad for getting her involved since it was my idea (and her Pakistani family found out while mine didn't), but it wasn't a huge deal.  This was in GA, $800 fine, 12 months probation (terminated upon completion of the terms of probation, which had to be done 10 months in or else you spent 60 days in jail).  40 hours community service, drug abuse counseling (at least like an intake thing to see if you had a problem), abstaining from drugs and alcohol (with ""random"" tests every other month since I was out of the state for school).  It was really a joke about the privatization of the criminal justice system: it was in everyone's interests (the probation company's and the people I started doing drug classes with's) to keep me in trouble with the law and take my money.

My Civ V game was fucking great.  I started as Gandhi on regular sized Earth map, Prince, regular length.  I don't have any screencap stuff/I suck, but I started on the West African Coast and expanded into just south of Ramses (in the northern Nile delta) and most of Subsaharan Africa through like the Congo.  I also settled a city in Morocco and another in western Greece.  (I ultimately settled Sri Lanka and northern Australia to get coal and uranium).

I owned Catherine in South Africa in like 1900 before clearing out Egypt and all land from Mesopotamia up to Finland (Western Europe is Arabia and everything in Siberia is England while near central Asia is empty until India or so).  I conquered every city Ramses built except for one, leaving him with those in Central Asia he captured from the Americans.  I left all those cities as puppets, to prevent unhappiness as I swept, but now I have to raze them: they all build factories and use up my coal and their building upkeep costs stagger my economy.  I also have some 150 unhappiness from population (bear in mind I'm Gandhi so it should be *twice* that: there's only 25-30 from number of cities).

Wages aren't flat because of some conspiracy or because of the policies of some Executive Branch administration.  Wages have been flat because demand for blue-collar labor in the US (at least at a US price point) has been imploding for decades now.

In the 1940s/50s, Europe had seriously damaged or wiped out its industrial infrastructure in World War II, to say nothing of killing or maiming workers.  India wasn't industrialized.  China wasn't industrialized.  Russia and China had both gone communist and basically hamstrung themselves as economic competitors.

If you wanted industrial work done, you were going to pay out the nose for a US worker to do it.  Demand for blue-collar labor relative to supply was very, very high.

Rebuilding happened.  Europe came back on-line.  Children were born.  Major third-world countries started on the path to industrialization.

In around the 1970s (well, earlier, even), demand for manufacturing in the US falling off relative to available labor caused infighting between people who wanted more blue-collar jobs than were available.  This is where you get stuff like the [1967 Detroit Riots from](http://www.67riots.rutgers.edu/d_index.htm) -- policies from whites put in place to keep available blue-collar labor for themselves, violence on both sides, etc.

In the late 1970s, market-based reformers under Deng Xiaoping in China started the gradual shift away from a command economy.  China slowly starts moving towards dumping its population -- over four times the US population -- onto the labor market.

The development of safer and more efficient good transport helps this process.  Many people who would otherwise have been even more impoverished, working at small-scale farming in China start moving to manufacturing and jobs going overseas to China.

The development of the computer and the spread of mechanized devices allows automation to a much greater extent than was previously possible.  Now, one man (a backhoe operator, or a repairman for a robotic device on a production line) can do the work of many with shovels.

It becomes harder and harder for someone without specialized skills that are in demand to find someone who wants to employ them.  A US worker who wants to maintain a middle-class standard of living has to be better than any robot, overseas worker, or computer, many times over.

The construction layoffs and manufacturing layoffs weren't produced by the banking crisis.  They'd been steadily coming for a long time.  It was just the recession that clobbered businesses hard enough that they couldn't keep trying to find ways to keep on running.  Layoffs disproportionately get clumped up during downturns...but an awful lot of these were layoffs that were coming no matter what.

Yeah, I'm a fiscal conservative.  But if you want to discount what I'm saying on those grounds, go up and dig up a fiscal liberal like Robert Reich.  He was Clinton's Secretary of Labor, and was pointing this out (a bit less bluntly) twenty years ago:

&gt;In addition, Reich used the office as a platform for focusing the nation's attention on the need for American workers to adapt to the new economy. He advocated that the country provide more opportunities for workers to learn more technology, and predicted the shrinkage of the middle class due to a gap between unskilled and highly skilled workers.

Or from his blog:

&gt;But here's the real worry. The basic assumption that jobs will eventually return when the economy recovers is probably wrong. Some jobs will come back, of course. But the reality that no one wants to talk about is a structural change in the economy that's been going on for years but which the Great Recession has dramatically accelerated.
&gt;
&gt;Under the pressure of this awful recession, many companies have found ways to cut their payrolls for good. They’ve discovered that new software and computer technologies have made workers in Asia and Latin America just about as productive as Americans, and that the Internet allows far more work to be efficiently outsourced abroad.
&gt;
&gt;This means many Americans won’t be rehired unless they’re willing to settle for much lower wages and benefits. Today's official unemployment numbers hide the extent to which Americans are already on this path. Among those with jobs, a large and growing number have had to accept lower pay as a condition for keeping them. Or they've lost higher-paying jobs and are now in a new ones that pays less.

What I'm saying is that the US seeing a lack of interest in blue-collar labor at the prices a US assembly-line worker could command from the world in 1950 is not the product of any of the policies that you've listed.  Yeah, there's always friction over how much by way of extra taxes the well-to-do should pay, and I think that Iraq was an inefficient use of resources too, but you can't accurately wrap up all the fiscal policies that you don't like and blame the decline of demand for US blue-collar labor on those -- not only did they not cause it, the processes were set in motion for a decline to happen decades back, and policymakers were well aware of the process a long, long time ago.",t1_c119o61,1286168469,wadcann,t5_2cneq

This is heavily debated and is far from a settled fact.

It is no accident, for example, that Zionism originally arose in the 19th century at the same time when other erroneous notions about race and purity and nationalism also arose in Europe.

I used to about to feel the same for no more than 1-2 years ago. I can barly recollect any memories from the previous 5 years from that point because my life consisted only of routines of work, go home and eat and play games. Sleep, work again next day, etc.... no memories of doing anything else tbh.

This might sound silly, but my life changed DRASTICLY after some deep thinking about what I want to do with my life and how I want to live my life. Then I saw the movie called  ""YESMAN"" with Jim Carrey, which very much sparked something inside me, and wanted to try what he did in the movie:  To say YES to things, even if they might sound scary.
In the start, I started to attend to parties which was allright.. but not that special.

But then, things started to happen, and within 1,5 year by now I've lived a more lively life than I've ever done in my previous 20ish years!
This is what have happened in the past 1,5 year:

- Moved out for the first time to the city ( I got asked at a party if I wanted to join in a collective )
- Learned to read, talk and write Japanese. Again, because I said yes when someone asked if I wanted to join in.
- Made LOTS of new friends and acquaintances, both local and abroad.
- Traveled to California, Sweden, England and almost Netherlands with my new friends.  Never had so much fun before. Again, because they simply asked me if I wanted to join
- FINALLY dared to go out with of my passions in life: Cosplay -  I've been attending around 4-6 differents conventions in Europe within a year. Each time, made so many fond memories and met new friends!
- I stood on the stage infront of thousand cosplayers, when I have a fear of stages, winning the cosplay competition for best equipment/weapon.
- Met my first GF, learned the hardship of first breakup, and grew equally much after wards from it.
- Met lots of girls, especially anime/lolita/cosplay girls and became 'cough' popular for some reason in their eyes &gt;_&gt;;
- Met a person, who is today my best friend who we support eachother no matter what.
- Learned ALOT of important life lessions, especially with girls. I used to be afraid to talk with girls, but today I've often been in the center of attention by 3-7 girls, very cute and hot ones, without feeling small and insecure.
- Speaking of insecure... in over 12 years, I've been believing that I would always be alone and ugly due to my appearances after a tough puberty. This ruined me ALOT, belive me. henche why I developed to become a sad person with no much life. This self view of myself changed over time when I had the opportunity to meet so many people, and they didnt show any sign of reject or problems with my apperance. My confidence have grown and I've learned that heart and mind is what matters in the end, and I'm no longer afraid to show myself and who I am.
- On a small sidenote, I used to have only 20 pics or so of me on FB due to that insecurity, but now I have over 300, which more or less others who have tagged me. 

The list goes on, and  I know for certain that it will not stop any time soon, I wanna learn to dance, encouraged to play piano again, travel to japan, china, pretty much anywhere I can, etc.. :)

All this because I started to rethink and stop being afraid of taking opportunities as they come up.  

However, as wackyvorlon writes: ""It's not all sunshine and roses.""  
I second that; Lots of shit have happened as well, hearts have been broken, tears have flown, I've been shouted on, angered on, and I've had some long on going arguments, fell into small depressions regular, running away from unwanted memories, etc. It can be really though sometimes, but I'm prepared for it and my mind is set on to expand my horizontal view, experience and learn as many lessons as much as I can. Nothing is that bad, that it won't be good for nothing.

I'm proud of myself and what I've archived after these few years, even thou I'm a bit heartbroken atm (had a break up a month ago), I can look back and smile, because she, along with so many great people I've met, have been a part of my journey and helped, giving me opportunities, to open myself up and become the more colorful person I am today.
The more I experience and live out my life, the more interesting person I become, when I share my life with others.

Sooo... needless to say &gt;&gt;&gt;  Break the cycle, by seizing opportunities. Watch that movie if you want to, its a fun one even if you dont take it seriously.  Small changes in your life today, will make a bigger outcome tomorrow. You never know whats gonna be behind a new door.

WASHINGTON — As the Obama administration escalates its battle with Chinese leaders over the artificially low value of China’s currency, a growing number of countries are retreating from some free-market rules that have guided international trade in recent decades and have started playing by Chinese rules.

Times Topics: Renminbi (Yuan) | Currency
Japan and Brazil have taken measures recently to devalue their currencies, or at least prevent them from appreciating further against the Chinese currency, the renminbi. The House of Representatives last week overwhelmingly passed the first legislation to allow the United States to slap huge tariffs on Chinese goods unless China allows the renminbi to appreciate, another mechanism for making Chinese goods more expensive here and American exports more competitive in China.

In Europe, policy makers have begun to fret that, despite the debt crisis that sent investors fleeing just a few months ago, the euro has now risen sharply again against the dollar, potentially weakening exports by making European goods more expensive. Those exports have been one of Europe’s few sources of growth, and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who will take over leadership of the Group of 20 biggest economies, said over the weekend that he was pushing for a new system of coordinating global currencies as wealthy nations did in the 1970s, before a free market orthodoxy took hold.

It is unclear if the result will be a “currency war,” as Brazil’s finance minister recently warned, or if these are just warning shots, fired to force Beijing’s leadership to make good on years of promises that it would allow the value of its currency to appreciate.

But that question is so in the air that Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner felt compelled last week to try to dampen the fear. “We’re not going to have a trade war,” he said at a forum sponsored by The Atlantic. “We’re not going to have currency wars.” He acknowledged that the only way to break the cycle was for a country “to decide it is in its own interest to allow its currency to appreciate in response to market forces,” and he said he believed that a “substantial fraction of the Chinese leadership” now understands the need to allow the currency to rise in value.

But it is unclear how far the Chinese are willing to go, since a more expensive currency means more expensive exports and a possible loss of jobs. “It’s a tradeoff for the Chinese leadership,” said one senior United States official who has talked at length to China’s top officials. “They are under pressure from governors and mayors who fear unemployment in China’s manufacturing territory, exactly what we are struggling with.”

But the fact remains that the rest of the world is beginning to mimic the technique China has perfected: manipulating currencies for national advantage, while resisting political pressure from trading partners.

Some economists argue that the standoff over China’s currency could herald a new era of protectionism reminiscent of the 1920s and ’30s, which they say they fear could undermine trade and make a weak recovery even weaker. But others argue that it was the free-market consensus of the 1980s and ’90s that weakened American competitiveness and was exploited by rising powers like China, calling for a more assertive policy to protect jobs, increase exports and keep industry at home.

“Everyone’s playing beggar-thy-neighbor games, willingly or unwillingly,” Michael Pettis, a Peking University professor and economist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said in an interview. “This is very similar to what happened in the ’30s, when the collapse in Europe’s ability to finance itself also meant a collapse in its trade deficit, and the world rushed around trying to find a new equilibrium in which every country tried to grab a larger share of the dwindling global demand.”

Of course, many countries have manipulated their currencies before — the United States reached a political accord with Japan in the Reagan administration to do exactly that, in an effort to reduce a yawning trade deficit. And for decades, despite global rules prohibiting the practice, countries have sought to help their industries by providing subsidies to companies, as Europe did for years with Airbus, its competitor to Boeing.

But many around the world fear getting trampled as the United States and the Chinese battle each other. Japan intervened in the currency markets recently for the first time in six years, after accusing China of driving the yen up to a 15-year high, in part by buying Japanese debt. But it was a short-term move, many Japanese experts fear. “Japan is in a sense losing out in this competitive devaluation war” through inaction, said Kazuo Ueda, a professor of finance at the University of Tokyo, and a former member of the policy board of Japan’s central bank.

Brazil took similar action and vowed last week to take whatever action it needs to prevent its currency from appreciating. Its finance minister, Guido Mantega, said in an interview that the actions by developed countries, including the United States, to keep interest rates at record lows, one way of devaluing a currency, was a “strategy from the past” that was threatening the economy of Brazil and other “dynamic” emerging markets.

“This is a kind of desperate action taken by countries to try to activate their economies,” Mr. Mantega said. “Since they have not been able to activate their own internal markets, the way out becomes exports. So developed countries work on devaluing their currency in order to become competitive in the few dynamic markets in the world.” Most Western governments, and many economists, place the blame for currency frictions on China, which has refused to let the renminbi trade at anywhere near its real value. Moreover, China has subsidized its exports with artificially low interest rates that shift money from consumers’ bank deposits into cheap loans to businesses.

These tactics are nothing new, especially among the emerging economies of Asia. But experts say the sheer size of the Chinese economy means that its currency policies have global effects.

Not surprisingly, the Chinese see the problem differently. The Chinese press is filled with articles arguing that Americans do not appreciate China’s efforts on their behalf. While other nations’ currencies devalued against the dollar in the 2008 financial crisis, some economists note, the renminbi did not. And while Chinese exports may be artificially cheap, the effect has been to give American shoppers bargains at the expense of Chinese consumers.

“Nobody thinks about that,” Shen Minggao, the chief China economist for Citibank, said in a telephone interview from Hong Kong. “Should China think about the welfare of Chinese consumers, not U.S. consumers?”

China could solve much of the problem by shifting to an economy driven by domestic consumption instead of profits from exports. And in principle, Chinese experts agree.

But China’s progress toward that goal has been glacial. Since June, when the government said it would move the renminbi closer to its real value, the currency has gained about 1 percent. Most experts say the real value is 15 percent to 20 percent higher.

A variety of economic and political factors limit China’s flexibility, said Li Daokui, who directs Tsinghua University’s Center for China in the World Economy. Dr. Li sits on the government’s Monetary Policy Committee, which advises China’s central bank, and stressed he was not speaking for the government. If China lets its renminbi gain value too quickly, he said, that could make exports too expensive and collapse an entire sector of the economy. That would spike unemployment and risk social unrest, which Chinese leaders are committed to avoiding.

Dr. Li said that a “mild appreciation” of the renminbi was needed, but that ordinary Chinese need to be prepared for even that small step. Otherwise, he said, “it’s counterproductive, because many people believe there’s a conspiracy to keep the Chinese economy from growing.”

Which consisted of Europeans playing off their colonial interests against each other.

Ironically, one of the contributions to the french revolution was the amount of debt that the French had contributed to America in order to play them off against Britain. Louis XVI had basically mismanaged the country to the extent that the French had nothing to lose by having a revolution since they had already lost everything by that point anyway.

So much so that loads of French straight couples refuse to marry out of solidarity, and will PACS instead. I count myself among them. 

I was there during the debates. Only one right wing parlimentarian voted for it. The Catholic Church threw all their weight behind the opposition.

In the UK it's more liberal. It's pretty much marriage except in name only. There are a few differences though but same-sex couples here don't complain very much about it.

Most of the time I would just cut and smoke cigarettes, or whatever. However, the times I went, my friends would be talking and whatnot, and I would just silently pay attention to the Eucharist. I mean the actual host the priest elevates. The presence of Christ in the Eucharist is just overpowering. It is not the only thing different about the Catholic Church, but it is the main thing. Christ is present in the Eucharist Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity. In other words, He is, in some mysterious way, there as if He were sitting in the room with us, on his throne if you will! 


Anyways, zip forwards. I was the most delinquent of my whole school pretty much, or up there with the best of them. I still regret all the drugs I did, as I have a hazy memory as a result. I left the school, went on some crazy adventures through Santa Fe, Montana, Canada, Alaska, on to Europe, Italy, and Rome. I went there with a bunch of Catholic friends who were all basically delinquent in their won right! We went to study philosophy, although I was the only one who actually finished a semester. This was in 1993. In November, I met a Canadian Bishop on the steps of Saint Peter’s. He was there on his first visit to the Pope as a new Bishop. We all hung out as a group for about a week, and towards the end, it was the first Saturday of the month, and we went to the Rosary with John Paul II. It is a semi-private affair with about 1000 people max. So, they set me to sit on the aisle. This was when John Paul was still in fair health, and he walked down the aisle greeting people. He walked passed me about two steps. I hadn't really moved to be in his vision etc. But then I said to myself – no way this guy is getting past me! So I called out spontaneously the first thing that came to my mind ‘God bless you!’. A bit ridiculous to bless the Pope, but there you have it. He turned back, looked me in the eyes, reached out his hand, and patted me on the cheek, saying simply, ah, yes, ah, yes. That man was so much larger than life. Like a modern John the Baptist or something. Anyway, a few days later, we were walking after dinner in a group, it was the last day the Bish was in town. I asked for Baptism. He started telling me about RCIA and all that jazz. I was talking about then and there. I had studied in a Catholic high school for 3 years, and was studying at a Pontifical Uni. So, he declared the chapel at the convent where he was staying part of his diocese (we were like 50 feet from the Vatican walls), and baptized me at midnight on November 17th 1993.


At the beginning of 1996, I actually entered a Monastery in France, and lived as a religious for five years. I left at the end of my temporary vows. I have been all over the place – probably more than I should. France, Italy, South America, Israel... I just finished my doctorate in theology. The way Christ just grabbed my heart, he is like a Lion, I just never looked back. It is awesome.


Finally, I want to add something that is a bit technical. The Catholic Church believes (i.e., faith, not proof) that man can prove (i.e., reason, not faith) that God does indeed exist. It however requires a fair amount of philosophical formation. I personally have this formation, and find atheistic arguments illogical and sometimes ridiculous. However, many so-called believers froth at the mouth and spew dribble, making anyone who affirms the existence of god, whether through faith or through personal knowledge, appear as a fool. We don’t want to be like them, or even associate with them. On the other hand, as you can imagine, dinner parties tend to turn in a certain direction when people hear of my formation, and there is always one who wants to go for my jugular. I personally win my debates, although I do not think this means much at all (and the same goes for an atheist who wins an argument – he may be the smarter man, and the bettor rhetor, but he almost certainly does not have the proper formation, or else has argued himself into a world of inconsistencies IMHO). More importantly, I have sat down at a table of twenty to thirty atheists and agnostics who are all college educated, and had great conversations with them about the philosophical demonstrations of the existence of God. I have never once had a deep conversation with an atheist where I think they walked away considering that I was a fool. Instead, there can be a deep respect, probably because it is unusual to see someone who is both open and very rationally oriented defending the existence of God. I will say now what I often say. I can present you the arguments for the existence of God succinctly, but you will not understand them. This is because they require a very large body of philosophical knowledge in order to understand that they are more than arguments from probability, and that they are in fact demonstrations. I do not think I will go into the details here on reddit, because I do not have the time for the certain debates to follow. Suffice to say, Thomas Aquinas, when properly understood, is extremely convincing. Biologists who claim to have philosophical proofs, not so much.


So, to end. I took the time to write this for you, because God is worth it, and you are worth it. I normally avoid all discussion of such things on reddit, since one must play whack-a-mole, so I decided to make a real-name account to post this one-off. God is very, very present. To everyone. Just ask Him (frickin humiliating the first time!).

PS. I really didn’t want this to be a preachy thing, and it probably comes across as that. I thought my experience was useful here. It’s just what is in my heart, I wrote and posted in one go without rereading.",t3_dmhny,1286188927,[deleted],t5_2qi4f

I specifically said it was **perceived** as a genuine Crusade (capital C) by the Muslim world, especially after George W. Bush used the word himself.

What I was alluding to was that while Europeans may feel they have become the victims of Islam because a bunch of Muslims emigrated there and wear burqas, Muslims also feel victimized by Europeans and that's more due to you know... bullets, tanks, missiles, lots of dead people. It just seems that of the two claims to victimhood, the Muslim one might have more merit and the Europeans seem a little disconnected from reality.

&gt; but on the other hand, people say that the hostility was already there and that conflict was inevitable.

9/11 was an attack on New York.

&gt; if al-Qaeda hadn't attacked New York, there would have been no invasion of Afghanistan, and no invasion of Iraq.

However, he had to deal with a defending midfielder who didn't want to take his calls after the World Cup, and who then proceeded to stomp his feet and go on strike in order to be offloaded to Barca. 

Considering Hodgson's budget, and the team he inherited from Rafa, the only real odd decisions he has made, has been to send Insua of to Turkey in favour of re-signing a glass-kneed Brazilian (currently injured), and signing Poulsen who looks more like a second Lucas Leiva than anything else.

Other than that, we just seem to have a load of players who are giving shit performances and phoning it in during matches. 

Torres doesn't even look like a remote shadow of himself. Hell, Torres looks more like an understudy to Fernando Morientes, rather than the kid who has been hailed as a future European star. 

I don't even know what Gerrard is up to at the moment, but it sure as hell doesn't look like footballing, and even less like being the captain of a team.

Cole at least seems to make an effort during matches, although strugling to make an impact on his own. 

Carra is running around cleaning up messes in defence, and making a few of his own in the process. 

The only profile player on the team who seems to actually make an effort during matches is Reina. And he gets sold out by his own defence, and has started making mistakes he seemed to have shook off a few seasons back.

Hell, at the moment the most promising player in the squad is Kyrgiakos. A fourth option central defender.

Hodgson should start acting like a manager in control of a team who is ranked at eighteenth place in the league, and maybe consider axing underperforming stars from the starting XI in favour for kids like Pacheco, who would probably gladly seize a chance to actually play if one was granted to him.

2) The argument can be valid, in some sort (the state/EU/US argument). They want to infringe on your privacy, the right to respect for private life, correspondence and similar freedoms/rights, and they want to do it because they feel that it is a proportionate infringement compared to the increase in crime prevention and crime solving it will lead to. The main problem with this line of argument, is that there is little data that suggests quantitatively how effective these traffic data are, interviews with LEAs suggest that 40-50% of the data they request, are helpful, but that is not a very meaningful number.. do they request only when they think they can get data out and really need it? do they always request data? The problem is that we have no good statistics that actually indicate how useful these data are.

What you seem to not understand is that I suggested these things happened not because of lack of regulation (YES I KNOW THE INSTRUMENTS THEMSELVES WERE UNREGULATED, I made no claim to the contrary) but because of the regulations and regulators.

The ruins of [Arkaim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkaim) were discovered back in 1987. Since then it has become massively publicized, both by Russian ultranationalists, and by white supremacists.

The Russians have been unhappy, losing vast areas of the old Soviet Union, and having more territories wanting to secede. They have been looking for a reason to assert that Russia really belongs to the Slavic people, and they have a right to it. Recent history doesn't support the claims so well, but if you can argue a case that the Slavic people (who are also linguistically descended from the Indo-Aryans, as are many many other language groups across the world) were living there in Russia 4,000 years ago, then you have a historical case for ""this land belongs to the Slavs"".

There is an interesting article [Archeology and Ethnic Politics](http://www.earlham.edu/~schwael/Arkaim.pdf) which talks in detail about how crazy the situation has become, with religious, mystical and political movements, all arising from these few ruins near Chelyabinsk. Much of the blame belong to the archeologists themselves. This was a time when Russia was in deep economic straits, and there was no money for things like archeology. In their effort to raise cash to continue digging, the archeologists threw out wild and speculative theories to arouse public sentiment that would get them some money and attention. Anything you can say, no matter how stupid, finds a believer, because people are so eager to believe. So Arkaim has been called ""Swastika City"" or ""Capital of the Aryans"" or ""Birthplace of Zoroaster"" and any number of things, none of which has any proof.

This archeology has also been making headlines on overtly racist sites that promote the ""Aryan Race"" and culture, and on other slightly less racist sites like freerepublic, for years. There are all sorts of theories, many of which completely deny the facts, in attempting to claim some pure Aryan heritage for white people.

The facts are much more modest. This region is indeed one of the places where ancient Indo-Aryans lived. However, the period of these settlements (1500BC to 2000BC) is much too late to call these people the ancestors of all Indo-Aryan people. This was a time when many European language groups had already split from the proto-IndoEuropean language. At best, you can call it a population of Indo-Iranian people. However, it is not even the earliest of those, since there is evidence that the same Indo-Iranian people had already settled in Iran and were arriving in India at this time. Obviously, their roots go back further, before these settlements in Arkaim and other regions around Chelyabinsk.

These settlements are all part of the [Andronovo Culture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andronovo_culture), or more specifically the [Sintashta-Petrovka-Arkaim](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sintashta) branch of it. This is a fairly late Indo-European culture, linguistically speaking. It's a wonderful discovery. Any 3000-4000 year settlements are great for archeology, since so little is known about these early days. But overblowing it to ""birthplace of the Aryans"" or ""home of Zoroaster"" in the interests of nationalistic or racial pride is just stupid.

First, free speech is not a ""vague ideal"" - it is a concrete political and social goal, encroachment upon which, no matter how well-intentioned, has been shown time and time again to lead to unintended consequences and slippery slopes.  It has been infringed upon in many European countries by paranoid, uneducated electorates and pandering politicians mortally afraid of largely imagined threats from Muslims and Neo-Nazis, and has in the past led to such outgrowths as Germany's and Switzerlands laws making it illegal to insult government officials.  It has led to bans and restrictions on books, films, games, movies, for reasons ranging from perceived incitement to violence, racism, discrimination, whatnot -- often used by various groups with an axe to grind for their own purposes.

European citizenry is, by and large, accustomed to centralized authority, with a few notable exceptions.  Even countries with common law traditions of open expression and individual liberties have succumbed to this.  How many countries do you know where the government / the voters trust the citizenry-at-large enough to regularly hold popular votes / referendums?

Less than ten downvotes are needed to hide a comment, reducing it's visibility to near zero for the average user. Yes, downvoting is a form of censure. It's why the reddiquette states it should only be done for stuff that is off topic or irrelevant. Personally, I don't necessarily oppose using it as a measure of agreement but then again I'm not arguing in favour of unrestricted free speech.

&gt; The downvotes are the result of poor logic and unfounded dogmatism. I didn't, but I'm mighty tempted upon re-reading your post.

Unfortunately for you, the post contains neither logic (either poor or good) nor dogmatism. It states a fact (the charge laid against Wilders) and then the local prevailing opinion on the concept of absolute speech. It gets downvoted because people disagree with it, nothing more.

&gt; First, free speech is not a ""vague ideal"" - it is a concrete political and social goal, encroachment upon which, ... I do not like giving tools for the suppression of my opinions to people who are not responsible enough to deal with them.

It's a vague ideal, and there is not a single nation on this planet where free speech is not severely limited in some way or another. The current European restrictions are in place exactly because of what happened the last time we allowed a politician to incite hatred against certain parts of the population. These laws serve a practical purpose. If you want to see them removed, it is up to you to convince the rest of your society that they are no longer necessary.

And yes, laws get abused sometimes. Abolish this law, and it will change nothing at all. There will merely be another law getting abused to serve the same end result. Deal with it by removing the abuser, not the tool being abused.

&gt; Second of all, ""we in Europe"" - fuck you very much for claiming to speak for me and others.  I can not stress this enough. I am European, living in Europe. I find European muzzle laws to be abominable, despicable, unworkable things. I vote against them, and the politicians who support them, every time I have the opportunity.

Yes, firstly thank you for your eloquence and kind words in this first sentence. They suit your argument well, no doubt. Secondly, in this opinion you are part of a tiny minority in the nations where such laws exist. When I say ""we in Europe"", I state the most prevailing opinion. We are not a hivemind, after all.

&gt; Third, ""pragmatic"" and ""realistic"" are terms regularly used by totalitarian or authoritarian governments to silence dissent and for ""those who know better"" to guide the populace in the direction of what's good for them. Be quiet, you, run along and play, let the experts make policy. That attitude is undemocratic and patronizing.

So pragmatism and a realistic worldview are inherently authoritarian now? Again, you see someone abuse a tool and react to it by trying to remove the tool instead of the abuser.

&gt; That is where your downvotes come from. You are no martyr, just very, very, sadly, wrong.

Congratulations, you are thus a hypocrite!! You just admitted that I am being downvoted in direct violation of the reddiquette.

Several states have vague and much-encompassing statements in their constitutions of the ""International human rights and treaties are to be respected"", in Norway the form of this is like this: ""Det paaligger Statens Myndigheder at respektere og sikre Menneskerettighederne."" (The government of the state is imposed to respect and secure human rights). The form is purposely vague and does not mention particular treaties or conventions. As such, practices from organs ranging from ILO to ECHR, organizations with more or less state-influence and state-originated power, is a legal source both when interpreting local laws, but also as a general principle.

The other part of the dualistic approach, is that they also often incorporate conventions (either word-for-word translations or a text ""in the spirit"" of the convention). This has happened for quite a few treaties, conventions and customary practices from wide range of organizations. 

3) The sweden democrats wear brown shirts, describe themselves as fascist (a few years back) and does the sieg heil on their own pictures (also a few years back, but still).

(first of all, some of these groups can absolutely be called fascist, but that is another debate). I'm trying to show you how your reasoning for accepting violence towards fascist is hollow, and your answer is to enforce my view of your reasons as circular?

Yes, language is a unifying factor between Indo-European peoples [like Greek was to the independent city-states of Hellas], but the cultural and ethnic ties go deeper. For instance, there are weaving techniques and tartan patterns that let us know if a people were Indo-European; there are figurines of certain gods; there are burial rituals [like being buried with your horse]. No other culture at the time-period did things quite like that. 

The horse-thing, in particular, makes them unique at the time-period. They introduced the animal to China. Europeans, on the other side, had never seen the animal. Greek myths of the ""centaur"" (the half-man, half-horse monster) are probably racial memories of the time when Greeks first encountered horsemen from the steppes and were freaked out by the sight. 

This horse-obsession leaked into all the Indo-European languages. It's why ""gentleman"" in most European languages translates as ""horse-man,"" like *chevalier* in French, *caballero* in Spanish, etc. Or why Alexander the Great's dad was named ""Philippos,"" which translates as ""horse-lover"".

Likewise, without any reference to language whatsoever, paleogeneticists can determine likely origins from DNA. Haplogroup R1a is associated with the Aryans. It's encountered at its highest rates in Poland and Hungary and spreads out from the Black Sea across Central Asia into Afghanistan and Northern India. The DNA, more than almost anything else, charts the movements of the people.

That's why when Russians dug up people buried with their horses in Siberia and saw that they had haplogroup R1a, they knew without a doubt that they belonged to the Aryan umbrella culture. Likewise with the Tocharians in Western China.",t1_c11bwke,1286204407,Drooperdoo,t5_2qh13

However, I don't think it's necessarily wrong to call Jews an ethnic group, per se. Race and ethnicity aren't the same thing, or at least the US Census doesn't seem to think so since the measure for Hispanic-ness is literally ""a person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, *regardless of race*,"" suggesting that if you are culturally Hispanic, that's good enough.  In order to become Jewish you have to dedicate yourself to a Jewish way of life--effectively assimilating into Jewish culture (and there is definitely a well-defined Jewish culture). It's that culture that makes you ""ethnically"" Jewish, if not semitic in origin.

EDIT: I also feel that it's important to note that there are different cultural practices WITHIN Judaism. Sephardic Jews are mostly Spanish/North African/Middle Eastern, and they have some differing customs than Ashkenazic (European) Jews. However, their Jewishness is not challenged.

You reasoning is shoddy.  The ""unifying technology"" didn't really make much of a difference, as stock markets still functioned in much the same manner then as now, just a touch more slowly.  Markets world wide still crashed, millions lost their jobs, and overall things were much worse for the folks back then than they are now.  Further, this wasn't even really a world-wide crash.  India, for example, hasn't been affected.

Shariah is not limited to government.  There is a spiritual sharia as well.  Sharia litereally means the way or the path.  Sharia is the path to god. Praying 5 times a day is part of the Sharia.  Fasting in Ramadan is part of the Sharia. Making Hajj at least one time in your life is part of the Sharia.  Many people misunderstand it as something like Democracy or Communism or Monarch.  A part of Sharia is government, but its more then that.

Also with Shariah, [Muslims who live in non-Muslim lands](http://www.themodernreligion.com/world/muslims-living.html) have to observe the laws of that country.  That is part of the Sharia.

So if the law requires a Muslim woman to show her face in a Bank or a Government building then that is not an issue.  The problem is when Western countries profess freedom but really don't give freedom to Muslims especially Muslim women.  There are women who are forced to cover, but by banning the burqa/niqab they are also forcing women not to cover even though it may be their choice.

Thank God, America is true to their principles unlike France or other European countries.

Also, many people say why don't the Muslims go back to the Muslim countries and live there.  The problem with that is that America and other Western Nations has influenced many of the governments (See Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and others) making them corrupt and not caring to help the people.  So they look to the West for opportunities.  Some of these Muslim countries also go further in banning the Hijab in schools or government buildings (Algeria, Turkey, Egypt, Syria).  So when this happens Muslims say, ""hey we can be a better Muslim in America or the UK instead of a Muslim country.  let's migrate"".

&gt;So if the law requires a Muslim woman to show her face in a Bank or a Government building then that is not an issue. The problem is when Western countries profess freedom but really don't give freedom to Muslims especially Muslim women. There are women who are forced to cover, but by banning the burqa/niqab they are also forcing women not to cover even though it may be their choice.

I have no problem with this stance. I can understand, though, why some groups might be concerned that women are being forced by their families to behave a certain way, rather than being free themselves. 

&gt;Also, many people say why don't the Muslims go back to the Muslim countries and live there.

LOL... I'm of German extraction, primarily. If I were you, I'd say ""Why don't y'all go back to Europe, then?"" We preach religious freedom, and I support that - as long as we maintain equal protection and don't allow religion to become law.

The French Revolution was more influential to Europe in the 19th century while the influence of the American Revolution had more effect on Europe in the 20th century. Britain, for example, just focused on different colonies after the American Revolution, particularly in India and Africa, but in the wake of the French Revolution it enacted democratic reforms. For the rest of Europe, the old regimes went into a reactionary mode trying to supress democracy and revolt. It was only at the end of the 19th, and especially after WW I, that the rest of Europe gave in to democracy. At the same time, the French Revolution spurred on the creation of nationalism in Europe—regiemes saw the power of the new French nationalism to mobilize people. The French Revolution saw the creation of the first mass army. Before this, armies were measured in the tens of thousands and were based around mercaniaries.  For the first time, armies numbered in the hundreds of thousands with masses of mobilized pesants. Mass armies lead to the high casualty rates in the Fanco-Prussian War and later in WW I and II.

In the 20th century, the American Revolution became more important as the rest of the colonies began to break away from their colonial masters. This was no less disruptive to Europe than the effects of the French Revolution.

There are many factors that went into these changes, but the two models had a great influence on European and world history.

Strangely enough, Germany just never really began to mobilize all of her resources, or even to put her economy on a war footing, until after the surrender of the Stalingrad 'kessel' in 1943.  So despite all of the Nazi's prewar propaganda about the necessity of producing guns over butter, in reality they tried to have their cake and eat it too up until it was finally concluded to commit themselves to a total war -- an amazing three &amp; a half years after war in Europe had begun and after all external opposition to date had been brushed aside with astonishing ease.  

This delay in committing themselves to a total war was also why the German production of war material, directed by the famous Albert Speer, skyrocketed in late 1943 despite the fact that this coincided with an ever intensifying bombing campaign by the Allied powers.  For instance, in 1944 Germany produced nearly 19,000 armored fighting vehicles -- tanks, assault guns, et cetera -- while during the same period of time the Allies dropped almost 60% of the total of 3.2 million tons of bombs that they would eventually dropped on Nazi occupied territory.  In contrast to the above mentioned production figure, when the war ignited in 1939 a mere **370** armored fighting vehicles were produced, and even as late as 1941 the numbers were still a few hundred shy of the 4,000 mark.  To further drive my point home, one must also compensate in these production figures for the fact that Germany's ""standard"" tank of the earlier years, the Panzer II, weighed only **a tenth** as much as the late war Goliaths like the Panzer VI 'King Tiger'.  So the amount of resources and industrial finesse required to produce merely one of those late war behemoths could by a conservative estimate have produced at least two or three, if not more, of the earlier war runts.

The principal reason for this lack of a war orientated economy was that Hitler was extremely paranoid, possibly even fearful, about a repeat of the Kiel mutiny and a loss of public support for the war.  Anyone who has read some of Hitler's earlier works, and even some of his later writings when he appears to be in the mature stages of a mental breakdown, can blatantly see how Hitler had viewed the armistice as an utter disaster for the German nation and a betrayal of the soldiers fighting on the frontlines -- which included him.  These events were to have a highly influential effect on Hitler and the delay in completely mobilizing for war was merely one manifestation of their influence.

If Americans today weren't in such a similar situation, it would almost seem remarkable how effectively the German home front was sheltered, especially during the early years, from the effects of the war -- which was precisely what Hitler wanted, and thus his overreaction to the mistaken bombing of Berlin by the RAF in 1940 that led to the diversion of German air power, the Luftwaffe, at a critical moment from attacking airports &amp; other infrastructure to the Blitz on London.  There was definitely an ever increasing trickle of the names of newly deceased young men appearing in the local newspapers for sure, but it wasn't until 1943 that the average German at home began to feel the sting of rationing and the effects of the Allied bombing campaign. 


Finally on a slightly related note, one of Hitler's self-professed reasons for being a vegetarian was that he felt eating meat was one of the prime causes of cancer.  And then fifty years after his death, research did actually begin to make a tentative connection between carnivorous diets and the occurrence of cancer.  Today the connection is still highly debated, but I think few scientists would be able to say with confidence that meat intake has no effect on cancer -- and in the future it may even prove to have a quite substantial effect on at least certain varieties of it.",t1_c11a4tb,1286209906,KCAugg,t5_2cneq

Intercity train fares in Europe will usually run you betwen $40 and $100.  Cheap flights are available in Europe and some in America that will usually get you where you want to go for between $30 and $125.

Hostels will run, on average, about $20/night.  In the US, you can find a seedy motel for $20 or get cheap but better stuff for about $60 (motel 6, etc).

Couchsurfing of course costs little to nothing.

Food - estimate what you spend in America, in Europe it'll be a bit more expensive, in Asia probably cheaper (except Japan, Korea maybe).

* The first is, as ragold mentioned, France was a large full fledged World power and amongst the most powerful to lot, unlike the colonies whic were, at the time, merely a British possession gone rogue.

* The second is that the American Revolution enfranchised only the richest landowners in the colonies and made very very little difference to the working man of the day, who was enticed into joining over a slight tax raise (at the time where the Americans paid roughly 2 schillings per person, the average Brit would have paid 20, thus the British reluctance to lower their taxes again) and populist politics. With the French Revolution, the entire working and middle classes now had a voice and a rigorous meritocracy was set in place.

* The final point is the measurement of equality. Where Revolutionary France promised Liberté, égalité et fraternité, the US declared that all men are created equal and immediately dismissed that by continuing to enforce slavery, remove Native Americans from their lands and enact in a period of segregation.

&gt;The dating game as it is played in Western society is tainted with attitudes that go all the way back to pre-history

I'm assuming you're in Northern America, because in my experience there isn't the same ""dating game"" in the UK (or the rest of Europe).  I can't think of anyone I know going on a ""date"".  Rather, relationships tend to develop more organically between people who share social circles, often with sex occurring early in the relationship.  

I've lived with women for all of my adult life, and none of them has ever avoided sex for fear of looking like a slut.  All of my female friends who have been in a relationship have had sex, often early in the relationship. 

I've also not experienced ""slut-shaming"" (Obviously not on the receiving end, anyway.  Male here, since I didn't mention it earlier) outside of high school.  Its just not a big deal for adults.  There's only one girl I can think of who has even come close to receiving this, and she's worked through half the guys in our workplace, passed STDs on to at least one and keeps an ordered list of their prowess.  And yet, she's not been ostracised for it.  In fact, she's one of the most popular people in the workplace, both with the men and the women.  Its a bit of a joke, but not a malicious one.  She's also now in a long-term relationship, with a guy who is well aware of her sexual history and it isn't an issue. 

Now, I'm not sure if this is a generational thing.  The UK (and rest of Europe) may have been as you describe in previous years.  If I had to guess, I'd put the change down to the shift in religious attitudes.  Pre-marital sex isn't a big deal here anymore.  ",t1_c11c4z7,1286214129,Ginnerben,t5_2qh3p

Lol what? You can get away with comparing which came first if you're ignorant but are you actually trying to compare the American war for independence to the French revolution in terms of achievements or scale.

Are you an idiot? Do you realize that France had a centuries old monarchy and was the dominant super power of it's time that got over thrown by it's own people? By 1792 the whole country was unified and under the constitution, it gave undeniable rights to all citizens and couldn't be denied by any local or state government. There is no denying, it's the first true constitutional democracy. It paved the way for revolutions throughout Europe and Asia, directly influencing the upheaval of monarchies and creation of rights for all man throughout the developed world. 

The American war was one about a colony fighting for fairer taxation, resulting in independence. The French revolution was the people of a superpower uniting to gain control of their own government.

As far as I know, young Americans still date.  Its just not something that happens in Europe.  And thinking about it, the lack ""dating"" part isn't even something new.  By dating here, I mean the social event where two people do an activity together in order to determine suitability.  It just doesn't happen.  And I don't know anyone who has done it.  My parents didn't, my grandparents didn't and my girlfriend and I certainly didn't.

In Europe, you tend to meet someone in similar social circles (Friend of a friend/at the same party/at the pub, etc.) and if you get on, you spend more time together within a group until one day you decide you're together.  I know it seems really hazy and indistinct, but... well, it is.  American dating is much more formal.  

The closest to ""formal"" in our relationships is the fairly awkward ""So... are we like, a couple now?"" conversation that happens fairly early.  

&gt;You may not be attuned to ""slut-shaming,"" since it's not something you sound as if you would engage in or condone yourself. When I was younger, there was a lot of disapproval for women who ""slept around.

For the record, I spoke to my girlfriend and she agrees with me.  Its not something we see.  It was fairly common in high school, but died off completely when I was at university.  My girlfriend didn't even experience it at school.  And she went to a snobby all-girls private school.  I really expected it to be a big deal there, to be honest.

&gt;There's also slut-shaming online, in the sense that women are sometimes reduced to non-entities by what used to be a male-oriented online culture. For example, the once-ubiquitous ""Tits or GTFO"" and the maxim that there are no girls on the internet. 

Agreed, although thankfully that seems to be dying out. 

&gt;Slut-shaming also comes into play when you talk about rape and sexual assault -- the assumption is that a rape victim was asking for it until proved otherwise, in a lot of male-dominated areas of the net.

Ugh.  Not experienced that.  Hopefully that's dying out.  If not, tell me where it happens so I can avoid it.

&gt;I'm glad to hear that sexuality is much more relaxed among the younger generation. It was a really repressive, ugly way to grow up as a female, back in the 80s and 90s.

My grandmother was a single mother.  I've heard lots of stories of how bad it could be 30 or 40 years ago.  My parents separated about 10 years ago and it wasn't a big deal.  I can only hope that its going to continue to improve.  ",t1_c11cod8,1286216212,Ginnerben,t5_2qh3p

Nobody knows what race they were, in fact, the evidence is that they were of many races that lived across a somewhat large area in Eurasian Russia. On the other hand, the Aryan culture is well-identified, marked by things such as a patrilineal organization of the tribes, an economy based on domestication in particular of cows and horses, worship of certain gods (such as the sky god), use of solid wheels (and later development of spoked wheels for chariots), etc.

As your own link to [Proto Indo-Europeans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-Europeans) says:

*Linguistic reconstruction is fraught with significant uncertainties and room for speculation, and PIE speakers **cannot be assumed to have been a single, identifiable people or tribe**. Rather, they were a **group of loosely related populations** ancestral to the later, still partially prehistoric, Bronze Age Indo-Europeans.*

The race of these people is not well established. The evidence is that it wasn't a single race as we commonly divide races today, but rather was a number of races that lived in a large geographical area, and followed the same customs and spoke the same language.

Today, you can identify these people by genetic studies. The best marker for them is [Haplogroup R1a](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_R1a_%28Y-DNA%29), which is a mutation on the Y chromosome, and therefore a marker of patrilineal descent from the ancestral populations. Today, there are 2 major concentrations of R1a - one in northern India, and the other clustering around Poland and the Ukraine, as you can see [in this map](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/GlobalR1a1a.png). However, to some extent this haplogroup is present in nearly **all** European populations and nearly **all** Indian populations, except the very southern tip of India.

In terms of races today, obviously the Indians and Europeans are not the same race, depending on which definition of race you use. They are certainly not the same color. However, these Indians are related to the ancient Aryans **much more closely** than otherwise white Europeans who live farther from the European centers around the Caucasus, Ukraine, Poland.

This is why it's sort of silly when people (most often white supremacists) go on about their ""Aryan heritage"". Because hundreds of millions of brown Indians are much more ""Aryan"" in their genetics than lily-white Scandinavians, for example. If you want to argue that white people are superior, then you're shooting yourself in the foot if you also call them ""Aryan"". The problem is that such people don't typically pay attention to the details, they prefer short sound bites and slogans.

The problem is that the racial supremacists don't want to give up that heritage - the proto indo-european language which is the basis of the bulk of European languages today, patriarchal lineage, the highly mobile society that developed war chariots and spread over so much of the old world, etc. The fact is that they don't need to - they certainly have indo-Aryan ancestry - but they need to **share** it, because so do a lot of other people, who are not white.

True. But keep in mind that hitler could simply have used another word for ancient europeans or ancient germans. He was making a political point, not a scientific one.

It is unfortunate that he used the word ""arya"", which in india is taken to be a civilized person. They refer to their god-king Rama as epitome of a good arya.

We're talking about the preservation of the Qur'an throughout history for all generations of Muslims. Those are technically two different subjects.

After all, I don't understand Arabic. If someone edited a copy of the Qur'an and gave it to me, I would not know. The verse about preserving the Qur'an is one, to my knowledge. It is 15:9. 

Are you saying that, if that one verse were tampered with or removed altogether, you would be able to tell the difference and know that the copy of the Qur'an you are reading has been tampered with? How would you know?

EDIT: And in case you respond ""because Allah has promised to preserve the Qur'an"", again I ask, how do you know? What if that (15:9) was the one verse inserted into your Qur'an? How do you know that verse is genuine? Is that verse even in your copy of the Qur'an? Flip it open and go to it and verify it. Now, how do you know that verse is real and belongs there?

After all, we do know that tampering of the Qur'an is obviously physically possible. Lightning isn't going to come out of the sky and strike you. What has failed, however, is trying to get an altered copy of the Qur'an to catch on. But would you be one of those who would catch on?

EDIT #2: Since you haven't replied yet, I'll just finish the train of thought rather than continuing it in a Q&amp;A method.

Allah did this action (preserve the Qur'an) with ""our hands"", so to speak (to borrow the language of the Qur'an from the opening verses of Surah Taubah). The reason it was important for us to make note of what ""our hands"" were doing, meaning the process of compilation and preservation of the Qur'an is that... this is what we modeled the hadith sciences on! With one caveat, Allah didn't guarantee the protection of other texts. So we really had no margin for error and that is what led to the hadith sciences or the science of hadith popping up, which, believe it or not... is the first true modern science of modern human civilization (West and East). Because this methodology from hadith (and that used in the science of fiqh (law) before it) was directly used by Muslim thinkers and philosophers and applied to the OTHER sciences (or rather, to all other fields of study... some of these weren't even sciences yet). This is how Muslims pretty much developed the modern scientific method. Experimentation, publishing results for peer review... this is what the specialists of fiqh and hadith did. This is what the Greeks did NOT do. What did the scientific method yield? EVERYTHING. Without it, Islamic civilization would not have lasted as long as it did and Europe would not have emerged from the Dark Ages when it did, if ever.

(Yes, that's the /r/PhilosophyofScience/ subreddit... good one to subscribe to)

So there were obviously great blessings in the method by which Allah preserved the Qur'an (understatement of the millenium).

There's one other ingredient that's critical for the development of a scientific civilization and that's honesty and integrity, and that naturally came from the strength of faith and zealousness of early Muslims who literally feared Allah and never doubted their faith, so they never feared questioning it. Richard Feynman's Cargo Cult Science is an interesting short on the subject of how integrity/honesty is critical to science.",t1_c11cr6p,1286217979,Logical1ty,t5_2qhbp

No one said that the Aryans spoke Celtic (although Celtic was an offshoot of the proto-Indo-European language). Nor that the words themselves signify anything. I said that the *concept* of horse ownership being tied to caste and social standing was an Aryan import to European culture.

The earlier paleolithic Europeans from which the Celts descend didn't have horses. Nor horse-culture.

It was a foreign concept to them . . . like the Greeks who initially saw horsemen from the steppes and like the Aztecs millennia later who saw Spaniards atop steeds assumed that they were strange Centaur-like monsters.

The early Greeks had no concept of horse-culture (but were later inundated by newer neolithic ideas), after which the term showed up as a caste designation . . . like Philip of Macedon's name translating as ""horse lover"".

And, no, likewise, the Greek terms ""Philos"" and ""Hippos,"" from which ""Philip"" derives were not used directly by Aryans, either. 

But the Greeks would use their later version of the language to describe a sociological phenomenon that was an import from the grassy steppes of Central Asia.

In other words, it was an accretion that happened later—after Aryan culture spread and pervaded the pre-existing paleolithic hunter-gatherer societies of Europe.

What words were used (at which time-periods) are irrelevant. What I was discussing was the new [Indo-European] ideas of caste and social-standing and how that affected modern European ideas [and ideals].

You shouldn't make such disparaging remarks about the assortment of fine cars in the US as compared to Europe.  In a large US city you can see all types of fantastic automobiles.  I have personally seen a vast array of fine autos in my city.   

Furthermore, the amount of people that are able to afford these cars are predominately located in one country, the US.

The ancestral people are dead and gone. Their genes **today** represent the R1a haplotype. This haplogroup survives in the greatest proportion **today** in North India and a small region of Europe around Ukraine and Poland, and the Caucasus mountains. Therefore, these people today have the highest degree of ""Aryan"" descent. This requires no guessing, this is basic genetics.

When you look at phenotypes today, you see that there is an obvious difference between the Polish people and the north Indians. Now if you really care about white racism, you can produce a convoluted explanation that the ancestral group was all one race, and then this race became ""diluted' as the people moved to different parts of the globe. The problem is that the extent of ""dilution"" can easily be measured through genetics, and is otherwise equivalent for these two populations.

The simpler explanation is that the ancestral population was of mixed ancestry itself. After all, modern humans have been in Asia for 80,000+ years (there is widespread evidence for the population of India by *Homo sapiens* by 80,000 years ago), and they have been in Europe for at least 45,000 years. This is a hell of a lot longer time scale than the 6000 or so years since the proto-Indo-European language. During this time, there have been many migrations of people, resulting in various racial types existing across both Asia and Europe.

People have to deny all this to magically assume a homogenous population for the ancient Indo-Aryans, preferably one that is homogenously white. And we are not talking about some small area, we are talking about an area spreading over millions of square miles (check out [this map](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Andronovo_culture.png) of the Andronovo culture). Any archeologist or historian with even a bit of sense realizes how ridiculous such an idea is. In the ancient world, there were no fenced borders, no visa stamps, no border police. The population was much smaller, and small groups of people were dispersed widely. You could be part of tribe A, and you could be living a few miles down from tribe B which was a different color from you, spoke a different language, had different customs.

"" ... by far the biggest category of conspiracy theorist is what I call the “failed historian.” He is someone who views human history through a rigid and all-encompassing ideological template. Some are Marxists. Others are Islamists, or Chomskyites, or radical Tea Party conservatives, or white supremacists. Whatever the details of their belief system, they all have a shared need to reconcile inconvenient facts with their totalizing world view. A conspiracy theory is a tool that lets them do that: It allows them to eliminate the painful cognitive dissonance that inevitably arises between fact and theory.

"" ...

"" Because the engine of conspiracism is the psychic gulf between what is wished for and what is, conspiracy theories are especially prominent in Islamic societies such as Iran. This is because the Koran, the associated doctrines of Shariah, and the entire arc of early Islamic history have created the expectation that Muslims will rule over infidels as conquerors — and that Muslim societies, having been enlightened by the Seal of the Prophets, always would be more militarily successful and technologically advanced than infidel societies. But the real world that Muslims see in the Middle East and Central Asia is precisely the opposite: Their societies are poor and backward compared to those of the West. (Tiny, successful, infidel Israel epitomizes this reality, which helps explain why so many Muslims refuse to acknowledge its existence.)

"" For this reason, Muslims have created a rich trove of conspiracy theories (some of them borrowed from Europe, such as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion) to explain away this situation. In the telling of these theories, they are able to convince themselves that history has been diverted from its “true” and honourable course by the machinations of Jews (or, if you prefer, “Zionists” or “neo-cons”); and that once these plots are uncovered and reversed, the natural, Islamic, order of the universe will again assert itself. In the process, they are able to draw in many non-Muslim leftists, who offer common cause in any conspiracy theory that discredits the Great Satan.

"" Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s comments in New York, shocking as they were to Western ears, are in fact entirely consistent with this conspiracist tradition. Deluded as his beliefs may be, they give us a crystal-clear view into the thinking that pervades much of the Muslim world. """,t3_dmqkn,1286220777,tzvika613,t5_2s2qn

There are numerous books in Sanskrit which additionally list parts of traditionally Hindu land within Bharat(India) like India today, Pakistan, Afganistan, Bhutan, Gilgit etc. while also mentioning Hindu culture outside the boundaries of Bharatvarsh like Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Cambodia etc.",t1_c11cy7r,1286222497,sniperinthebushes,t5_2qh13

I like that he offers natural alternatives to big pharma and supports his claims with results from scientific studies.  Obviously he's selling his products as well, but that's why I suggested going to Vitacost for cheaper alternatives.  

I'm not suggesting everyone pay through the nose for resveratrol pills for example, but he's been talking about it for years whereas it's just starting to get noticed by mainstream medicine as pretty remarkable antioxidant.  Mercola isn't ahead of the curve per se, but he's unrestrained by the AMA's addiction to big pharma and open to the possibility that nature offers medicines that are just as effective as what the guys in lab coats can come up with.  I mean shit... aren't we pretty much all of the consensus that marijuana is actually GOOD for you?  I'm sure Mercola would suggest that too, if it were legal to do so.  

Everyone on reddit knows well enough how to use the net to check the science behind any claims, and I've found that much of his advice seems to jive with the science and even with what doctors outside the states often recommend.  For example, while Americans all suffer the myriad deleterious side effects from prescription cholesterol drugs, most European doctors just advise their patients to take fish oil since the results are the same without the side effects.  Doctors would suggest the same in the states if it weren't for the fact that they are trained to only dispense prescription medicines, since the AMA and big pharma don't make money when people self-medicate.  

Obviously, it's up to each of us to take responsibility for our own well-being, and that's all Mercola is trying to preach while showing that it is quite possible to find safe OTC supplements to accomplish the same ends as Lipicrestpaxiproamberalliquin.  If you have a serious condition, by all means follow your doctor's advice, but for those of us who are just trying to maintain our overall well-being, I think you're better off taking a few GRAS-and-effective supplements like fish oil and vitamin D than seeking out pharmaceuticals that breeze through the FDA faster than leaded Chinese toys find their way into kids' meals.  

As for vitamin D, since your body itself produces the vitamin well beyond 10k IU from just spending an hour in the sun, it seems to be fairly self-evident that it's not something that's going to kill you by taking two little gelcaps a day.  Your body won't absorb the whole 10k anyhow when taken orally, and in the winter you're probably not getting any from the sun unless you live south of the Mason-Dixon line.  All you're doing is taking liquid sunshine, minus the UVA/UVB damage.  As for fish oil, all you have to do is look at average lifespans of the fish-gobbling Scandinavians and Japanese, who both live far longer than steak-and-potato eating Americans, to see that there's some truth to it.

Horses [and equestrian culture] came in with the so-called ""neolithic farmers"". The fancy new re-invention of the old ""Aryan invasion"" model.

Celtic words came into Latin languages because at the time of the Roman Empire, a substantial part of Central and Western Europe spoke Celtic tongues. So those words bled into Latin. Especially as the Roman Empire collapsed and Latin was spread not by Romans but by Gauls and Germanics. So Spanish, for instance, is a thoroughly Germanized version of Latin. It's Latin as the Visigoths spoke it (from the time when they were mercenaries in the Empire). So a ton of Germanicisms entered it.

Celticisms naturally bled into Spanish because of the Celt-Iberians who pre-date the Greeks and Romans in Iberia. (In fact, the Irish, Welsh and Scottish entered the British Isles from Iberia. So the oldest proto-Celtic inscriptions are actually found in Spain and Portugal.) So it's natural that, among the Basque and Iberian tongues, Celtic would bleed into the newer Latin.

It's irrelevant that the terms ""caballero"" and ""chevalier"" entered from the Celts, in any case. Because the Celts had *already* been Indo-Europeanized. The concepts were what I was addressing, genius.

It's a risk she's taking. I tell her to get insurance but she doesn't want to - it's her choice. But it's a risk she runs and I support her right to choose. She does have about 70k saved right now but that won't really cover cancer treatments..

Old people being left to die? What about policy-holders being denied care? The US is being strangled by the elderly and the obese. My grandmother was kept alive against her will for 2+ years because Medicare was paying for her to be fed by tubes in an intensive care hospice/hospital. She finally died at 87, after suffering miserably, refusing to eat, wanting to die and being force-fed, all the while costing tax payers an immense sum. My grandfather was given a quadruple bypass at age 85 and died from the extremely expensive operation for which they had to sell the family home the built themselves and raised 8 children in. 

Something is really fucked with the system, but those kind of things don't happen in Europe.

When you come here I will happily give you:

* A place to live and a generous allowance while you get used to my country
* Schools so your children can get an education
* Health-care so you won't get sick
* Language training and help finding a job

In return, I expect from you:

* That you learn to speak the language. You can probably speak to your friends in Arabic and get by with a little English, but as long as you can't communicate in my mother tongue, I will see you as a foreigner. Of course I understand that my language is one of the hardest in the world to learn, but unless you have some kind of trauma-related learning difficulty, you should make an honest effort to get the basics down.
* That your wife works. It is extremely hard to survive and raise children on one income. Stay-at-home mothers are a thing of the past, and only seen in economically independent families. I know that it's not normal in your culture, but in order to survive here, it's critical. Otherwise you will live in poverty for the rest of your life.
* That you accept your children hanging out with locals. Not having Danish friends to support you and teach you about life here is the easy way into a socioeconomic slump.
* That you respect the laws of my country, before the laws of your home country or the laws in your religion. I don't care what your daughter wears on her head or if she's allowed to go out with boys – that's between you and your daughter – but don't refuse to shake hands with female coworkers, and don't mutilate your newborn children's genitals. You've moved here and you receive financial support from the state – the least you can do is comply with the law.

Some muslim immigrants happily take the free money, education, and health-care, without even making an effort to learn the language, make friends with Danes (the majority of us are friendly, although some will always be xenophobic), and live by Danish rules and norms. The small percentage of muslims who do this make the rest look bad.

I, for one, think that immigration is good. I love islamic culture (especially the food and music) and I have lots of muslim friends, but one also has to accept that there are A LOT of social problems in some areas that are directly caused by muslim immigrants living in ghettos.

It's rare when different fields come to the same conclusion independently. But that actually appears to have happened with regard to the Indo-Europeans. A linguist (named Professor Russell Gray from New Zealand) built a computer program and keyed in all the Indo-European languages to see where the most-likely genesis of the ""parent language"" came from. The computer gave Anatolia as the most-likely ""ground zero"" for the origins of Proto-Indo-European. And it said that the time-frame was circa 9,000 BC. 

Working independently from the linguist was an archaeologist, who came to the same conclusion. Anatolia, he said, was the most likely entry-point for the Indo-European culture to come into Europe. Strikingly, he gave the same time-frame: 9,000 BC. (Interestingly, the archaeology confirmed a theory that had been around since L.A. Waddell in the 1920s.)

And, of course, geneticist Colin Renfrew most famously traced the DNA paths out of Anatolia and noted that a massive population migration happened circa 9,000 BC. (Up until then, Europe was mostly R1b territory.)

Actually France has a fertility level about the same as the US.  In fact they recently beat Ireland as the country with the highest fertility rate in Europe.

&gt;short work weeks/ long vacations, 

Oh no France is not just letting the rich get as much money as possible by treating their people like slaves and yet look at the massive debt the US has despite not doing so.

&gt;high taxes
The US has high taxes when you consider all taxes, but a big chunk of that is dumped away.  Also US taxes overall are regressive to the middle class and highly beneficial to the super rich.

&gt;exorbitant benefits

By American standards aka the people who take work abuse and keep and riot when someone tries to make things better for them.

&gt;and growth that sometimes doesnt even beat inflation

Oh no there's no exponential growth all the time!  Everyone knows a healthy country is one that creates massive bubbles that show how good ""growth"" is and then gives the super rich trillions when the bubbles burst.

&gt;not to mention regulatory climates hostile to business development.

This is a much more complicated issue where we may agree to a point.

&gt;who wouldve thought the whole system hinged on a few duplicitous rich people.

Just circumstantial evidence—that, and a buttload of corpses dug up and subjected to DNA testing.

The Atlantic Coast of Europe has Europe's highest concentrations of R1b. It's the Basque haplogroup, and is associated with Europe's paleolithic population. Its hunter-gatherers. Its cavemen, in essence.

Before the Aryan invasion, circa 9,000 BC, the paleolithic peoples of Europe basically held full sway. Then we see them receding under pressure from the East. As R1a starts to rise numerically, we see the older R1b flood further and further west—until today when they're pressed up against the Atlantic Coast of Europe. Why did they stop there? A little thing called the Atlantic Ocean. There was nowhere else to flee.

T.H. Huxley talks about how the original language of Europe was probably Basque, and says that Basque was spoken as far east as Sicily. H.G. Wells, in his ""Outline of History,"" talks about the affinities between the Sumerian tongue and Basque. (And, yes, yes, I know: connecting Basque to every language on Earth is every linguist's pet hobby. But the thing that makes the Sumerian connection not quite so looney is an extinct language in the Caucus Mountains called Burushki, if memory serves, that was probably the closest provable language to Basque. The Sumerians descended into the Middle East from the Caucus Mountain region. So proto-Basque probably stretched as far east as modern-day Georgia and Ossetia.) Recent scholars, too, have pointed to Basque gods and Sumerian gods, and how they're shockingly similar, with absurdly similar names—demonstrating the Basque passage from the Near East into Europe. But enough of gods— As to language, it was a massive one before the Indo-Europeans came in (if we're to believe T.H. Huxley and others).

The Indo-European invasion is postulated to have occurred circa 9,000 BC. To put it in context, the paleolithic Europeans entered Europe between 40 and 50,000 years ago. So the Indo-Europeans are incredibly new, in terms of history.

It's really extraordinary how the Basques have held onto their language and culture throughout all that pressure. Even those Basques who have been culturally raped and gone over to the dark side are still largely Basque ethnically. Goldstein said that the British are not actually Germanics. (Less than 5% of their ancestors were Anglo-Saxons. They were essentially Basques, who adopted a Germanic language.) Likewise, with 90% of modern Iberians. They're just Basques, who adopted a Latin language. Same thing with the Irish and Welsh. They're all just Basques. About 50% of modern Germans are essentially paleolithic as well.

The balance tips toward Indo-Europeans once you hit Hungary and Poland. Then the new genes start showing up at higher rates than the older paleolithic ones.

In Central Europe, you get a 50-50 split, while on the Atlantic Coast, you have extraordinarily old paleolithic populations, with 90-98% R1b rates in places like Ireland or the Basque country in Northern Spain.",t1_c11dgj5,1286232796,Drooperdoo,t5_2qh13

Sprained my ankle, went to A&amp;E (E-R) on a Friday night.  Had a bit of a wait due to drunk idiots coming in, but got xrayed, then went on my way.

Sister's baby was born with a fused heart valve.  Doctor's noticed her (the baby) wheezing after she was born and diagnosed this rare condition within a few hours.  Was transferred to specialist baby unit in Bristol (about 45mins away) the next day.  Spent 8 weeks in ICU (intensive care), had 2 operations (1 to unfuse the valve, 1 for a shunt (holds the valve open or something)).  Had the top baby heart surgeon in Europe apparantley (they took an interest in the case as it was a rare condition).  Had a nurse at the bedside 24/7 (this was for every baby, not just my niece).  Sister was put up free of charge in a MacDonald's funded house, free food, free board (you know what box on the MacDonalds counter for spare change?  That's where it goes).  Baby transferred back to home city after about 6 weeks, stayed for another 2 weeks as they nursed her back to health.  Now living fine (has to have some medication, not sure what, no cost.  Also had about 7,500 free feeding tube and syringe systems to help).  Follow-up hospital checks every few months.

&gt; A great English scholar whom years ago I asked to explain how at this time of day a philosophy so utterly absurd as that of Hegel was in full sway in English academic circles, whilst it had long ago died out at the German Universities, told me he did not wonder at it in the least. The English mind was so absolutely practical that for a philosophy it needed something absurd in the highest degree, because it would at once pull to pieces every reasonable philosophy offered. I do not think this was quite a satisfactory explanation, but must confess I know of no better; and if one thing is certain, it is that the chasm which everywhere in civilised Europe exists between theory and practice, and more especially between current social theories and the actual state of things, is felt nowhere less than in Great Britain.

Your right that the way imperialism affected Japan was different from how it affected other Asian nations. But I can say that they way other nations were affected by imperialism cannot be categorically similar since they all had vast different qualities of colonization or subjugation. 

Although Japan was able to modernize because their ass was close to the fire from looking at how all the other countries were being put under by the Europeans, one can argue that Japan (although under the guise of being independent) was most definitely subjugated by western powers. 

Although I don't have the time to look up and post relevant articles. Many photographers and artists at the time were stereotyping Japan as the ""wild east"" where the Samurai leaders were rumored to brutally behead criminals.

I know too much about this topic. The reporting falls short in a couple places.  
  
Having just a phone company and cable company compete is A-OK. In Europe you see some resellers, but margins are thin, and service is poor. In the future, mobile companies will also compete, as they roll out 4G / LTE networks.  
  
Every US cable company today already offers 20 Mbps (DOCSIS 2.0 technology). US Cable companies definitely want to outdo phone companies on speed (this will help them keep your cable business), but have been technically limited. They are in the process of rolling out DOCSIS 3.0 in key markets, which allows download speeds of up to 100 Mbps. Europe already has it. The US is behind, but will be DOCSIS-capable in 1-2 years.  
  
In the end, Americans don't want speed enough. It's very expensive (new customer modem and network equipment) to enable DOCSIS 3.0, and it's done based on customer demand. The US has not demonstrated a strong desire for 50-100 Mbps, and not enough to justify the investment - customers will not pay more.  
  
In fact, there are few uses for 100 Mbps, beyond occasional file sharing. And even in regions where 50-100 Mbps is offered, customers generally opt for 20 Mbps. It's really more of a marketing gimmick than anything else, to keep your cable subscription.

The reason why so many women deny or delay sex, even if they DO want it, is because of the whole terrible slut-shaming culture that is prevalent in the US. Girls who tend to have sex with guys that they've just met are labeled as sluts by both their male AND female peers, so to avoid being considered ""easy,"" girls do often deny or delay sex, even if a girl wants to do the deed just as badly as the guy does.

It's completely fucked-up, obviously, but the idea that girls who enjoy sex are ""sluts"" or ""whores"" is one that sadly seems to be ingrained in American culture. We're still very much a patriarchal culture, and it sucks, but that's just the way it is.

From what I understand, slut-shaming is pretty much an exclusively American thing. I have plenty of friends that grew up in European countries and from what they tell me, ""slut-shaming"" does not really exist in Europe (for the most part, anyway). If a girl wants to sleep with a guy, then she does. No one will look down on her for it or label her as ""easy"" or anything like that.

Ever since I was a young teenager and I started to have sexual thoughts/feelings, I always thought that the whole idea that women who enjoy sex are ""sluts"" was stupid and archaic, and I strongly believe that women should be encouraged to be more comfortable with their sexuality instead of being stigmatized for it. That being said, however, my husband and I had sex for the first time only a few days after we met, and I remember being terrified that he would just assume I was ""easy"" and never want to see me again after that. I guess even *I* wasn't immune to the fear of being labeled as a slut because I chose not to delay sex.

Needless to say, he did want to see me again (we've been together for over six years now and just got married), and it seems so silly to me now that I automatically assumed he'd think of me as a slut.",t3_dmlat,1286236771,daile,t5_2qh3p

Consider the historical context.  Women were, both by choice and by force, homemakers.  The husband would come home and the woman would care to his needs (make his food, iron his clothes, or even something as simple as meeting him at the door and taking his coat).  Then the couple would go out and the husband would buy the wife things, pay for food, open doors for her.  The idea was that women were more perceptive to subtle hints about emotional states, so they could sense what their man needed and do it.  Men were not as perceptive so they simply took every possible opportunity to be as nice as possible with no expectation of reciprocation in kind.

Now, this traditional husband-wife system no longer exists, but the cultural perceptions which were derived from that system still remain: for example, men are taught to be nice to women and women are taught to be caring to men.  

This is not necessarily a *true* perception anymore.  But now you see the historical and social context.  Now, consider the fact that the two gender norms are not equivalent (the whole basis was that women are more perceptive than men).  What we've had recently is women are getting less and less perceptive.  I blame this on feminism, on equating ""being nice to men"" with ""being subservient to men"".  I think feminism is nice in principle but in fact has ruined a whole generation of women (and by proxy, men).  But that's just me.  So in a sense, women are no longer fulfilling their half of the bargain.  Men, on the other hand, were always clueless.  So men keep on being nice and chivalrous because that's the only way they know how to deal with the problem...except they're increasingly getting frustrated at women who no longer have the tools to keep the old social scheme in line.  Now, men are increasingly reacting the only way they know how: sentiments like this post.  ""Why should *we* be nice all the time?  What do *we* get out of it?  How is that fair?""  Well the point is, we used to get a lot out of it.  Women were always the ""fairer sex"".  But they're rapidly becoming just the ""other sex"".  So chivalry has little reason to exist save for its own fading momentum.

There are two arguments in favor of chivalry (towards women specifically).  One is sociopathic: women don't understand why men are getting so frustrated and why the social-gender order is breaking down (even though they're the cause of it).  The whole ""it's so hard to find a good man nowadays"".  So if you're a holdout of the old, chivalrous ways, women will often be attracted to that.

The second is kind of like a romantic fool's wild hope.  The ideal relationship for many people is one from the ""old days"" or at least resembling it: the woman notices and takes care of the man's emotional needs with a very fine-tuned care, and the man in return takes care of the woman with very general, ritualistic care.  If you're a man and you're chivalrous to every woman you find, maybe one day you'll find the right woman and it'll work.  Hard to do that if you're unchivalrous from the start.

In all fairness, I should add that I'm chivalrous but for a very improbable reason: I just hate men in general.  I think the vast majority of them are brutish louts.  So it's not being nice to women, exactly: it's being nice to everyone, except the majority of men.  But again, that's far from a normal reason for chivalry.",t1_c11douk,1286238171,Moridyn,t5_2qh96

But Japan did exist during the Imperialist Era and they were affected! And one can say that the US, acted upon Japan, using the morality and conscience that was highly popular during the Imperialist era. They imposed a very unfair trading agreement with Japan which forced a country that had for a long time exerted an isolationist policy to make extensive changes socially, culturally, and politically. A small fishing town, Yokohama, is now currently one of the biggest most populated cities in Japan mainly catalyzed by Foreign traders and merchants. Most of the education systems in Japan is modeled after the West. Foreign professors and advisors were imported from Europe and US to advise the development of Japan. They modeled their first ever constitution after the West! The emperor started changing his clothes in order to fit in! The whole confucius hierarchy was demolished and equality was technically given to all! The Samurai who were in power for hundreds of years lost their political power. Culturally they were subjugated. Also your missing my point. I was talking about HOW it was affected...I have no idea really what you are getting at?

Also it's very hard to argue that friendly competition is what pushed Japan into rapid westernization. Many argue that Japan westernized in fear that if they did not they would be colonized. They would rather subjugate their own culture than another western power. Maybe in later years when Japan grew a strong sense of nationalism, Japan truly did want to yield imperialistic positions - but in the beginning its hard to argue that they wanted be like their western counterparts without motives burgeoned from fear. 

The main thing I found disconcerting about your original post is you make it seem like the US was taken aback by what the Japanese did, because there seemed no reason for Japan's retribution.

&gt; There is no need for you to get defensive. If you are not doing anything about anti-gay legislature other than posting comments about it on reddit, then it stands to reason that gay rights are of lessened importance to you. And that's fine. Nobody needs you to fight for something you do not even really believe in, unless you are a mercenary or something.

They are not of immediate importance to me, you're right about that.  However, I fail to see what you're trying to claim here.  Just because you aren't actively protesting world hunger doesn't mean children starving is not of importance to you.  I'm against harmful bigotry, and the anti-gay movement qualifies without question.  You asked for how religion has oppressed people... I know several gay people and this certainly qualifies. 

&gt; Again, you are opting for the hyperbole through the juxtaposition of two extremely disparate points. Let me ask you this, can you honestly say you have never employed some form of fear in the rearing of your children?

Yes.  I can honestly say that.  Before you try and twist that, I'll go ahead and explain that having consequences is *not* fear.  I do not spank my children, I do not invent threats for them.  My children might be disappointed, worried, or sad about what consequences they might have, but if your children are *frightened* of your reactions to events, then you've driven a wedge in your relationship.  Yes you can use physical punishment if you want, and it will get results short term.  It is not something I wish to do and the AAP is undecided about whether it works at all which is not a good sign. 

&gt; What, in your opinion, are good values? Wouldn't you say that an upbringing based on religion is just as likely to instill good values in an individual, than on void of any form of religious faith?

If you really want a grasp of good values, check out the book 7 Habits.  It's even got a Christian slant to it, you'll like it, but I find the points it makes to be quite universal.  Religion *can* be great, but it comes with baggage that seems to corrupt the good intentions of those that wish to jump into it's waters.  The false dichotomy of good and evil, indoctrinated argument from authority, and us vs them mentality are things pretty well ingrained in religion.  Well, at least the Abrahamic religions. 

Along those lines, my point is that religion can't be good, it's that it seems to promote several traits that are quite bad.  And lets face it, you don't need the threat of invisible father figures to raise children.  Other cultures were doing if for thousands of years before imperialism, and most of Europe, Japan, etc are doing it currently.  And this is all of course ignoring that fact that the usual required beliefs of the Abrahamic religions are akin to believing Greek mythology. ",t1_c11d627,1286240081,TheRedTeam,t5_2qh2p

The problem is that when racism is addressed here, Australians (and I'm an expat, so I've lived in other countries and have some distance in my perspective) get really angry and defensive, as you see here.

Whereas in the UK people are also shocked and disgusted by racism, but don't abnegate responsibility in the same way.  Perhaps because our migrant groups are better/longer integrated in many areas.  Perhaps because we have more ""non-white"" faces in the media and in politics.  Perhaps because we don't have the unique issues with a wrecked and self-wrecking indigenous population.  So maybe it's easier for us to confront racism when we do see it, because we have more confidence that most of us don't perpetrate it.  I know my great-grandparents didn't shoot Aborigines, for example, but there are people in Australia whose great-grandparents possibly did.

I also think there's a sense here, though I wouldn't call it racism (any more anyway) of the ""foreignness"" or non-whiteness of certain nationalities, that we just don't have in the UK any more.  Eg southern Mediterraneans.  For example I wouldn't regard a Spanish family as differently ""ethnic"", just European.  Whereas here there is this whole ""wog boy"" thing - I know it's become affectionate in recent generations, not perjorative - but I would never think to mentally collate Italians/Greeks/Lebanese etc into a specific group.  

It seems to me that although things are fine now, even these nationalities were more recently marginalised in Australia in a way that they haven't been in the UK for several decades.",t1_c11bmh6,1286240902,istara,t5_2qh13

From a historical standpoint, the American Revolution yielded a subtle but important change in history. But given what the Americans already had, the changes were small. Sure, the Americans became independent, but being a few months by boat from the Motherland had always granted the Americans more freedoms. By the time the US Constitution was written and ratified, the US President held more power than the British monarch (source: The Eagle and the Crown: Americans and the British Monarchy by Frank Prochaska; the Gregorian kings never had as much power as the colonists believed; it is also worth pointing out that the Articles of Confederation had US presidents, but everyone forgets about them.). 

The belief that the American Revolution was radical requires a bit of ignorance about American and British history. Parliament’s consent had long been required to levy taxes, which had resulted in the English Civil War, Commonwealth and then Protectorate in 1642-59 which firmly established Parliament’s power. In the Glorious Revolution of 1688, Parliament replaced James II with William &amp; Mary (The College of William &amp; Mary? The name is a celebration of Parliamentary power). Even the celebrated House of Burgesses of Virginia point to a long democratic history in the American colonies. It was not until the American Civil War that the concept of colonies-turned-states as separate entities bound into union by choice was finally dispelled and America was firmly cemented as a unified nation.

The French Revolution on the other hand was pretty severe and, well, revolutionary. The French killed of the monarchy, completely replaced their system of governance, and most importantly tried to spread their revolution. The French saw themselves from the outset as French. Not as Virginian, New Yorker or Marylander, but French. So when French armies steamrolled through Europe, resistance to the French nation instigated the rise of nationalism in the rest of Europe. 

The French also exported their sense of rights. “Fraternity, equality and freedom” are French ideals. The British had only-the-wealthy-can-vote and the US had blacks-are-3/5-of-a-person. Sure, the US has the Bill of Rights, but the “Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen” was spread to the rest of Europe.

Finally, being first doesn’t really count in history. Leif Ericson was the first European to reach America, but we celebrate Columbus Day because his discovery led to something. Creative made the first MP3 player, but the iPod is still more famous. Microsoft has been pushing tablet PCs for a decade, but Apple’s iPad still is captivating the industry. It’s not that America doesn’t matter in world history; it is merely that America does not really matter on a world stage until the 20th Century. 

Unfortunately, elementary school teachers have always focused on things the kids will care about: America. When kids don’t really care about the French, teachers don’t bother to tell them of how much more important the French were in comparison to the US. When kids want to hear about good guys battling evil, that’s how history gets presented to them. But as kids mature, the system doesn’t really mature their understanding of history with them.

TL;DR : Impact matters more than first, warring French republican armies changed the world most, and the French acted like nation much earlier than the US.

2. Jesus of Nazareth's teachings included hating all those who refused to accept him as their personal Lord and Savior -- even if they were your own family.

Perhaps, but the amount of effort put into this one virus is...disturbing, to the least.
  
&gt;Unfortunately, these things can get out of hand.
  
Precisely.  I work in this field, and the experts that are working on combating stuxnet give it more or less or less three weeks before it ends up in a toolkit.
  
The thing is that Siemens technology dominates in Europe and there's quite a lot of it in China as well.  It's less present in North America, but still has a significant portion.
  
Another problem is that stuxnet doesn't just target nuclear plants.  It can inject code into an OB and that can affect any place that has Siemens' PLCs, be that a nuclear plant, a steel mill, a waste water treatment plant,a plastic cup factory or a cruise ship.  This has the potential to be really bad news.
  
That being said, this is not the kind of thing that's going to infect plants over the internet, as most, well pretty much all of them have production isolated from the outside world.
  
One last thing.  It would seem that the virus entered in due to some lax security practices from a Russian integrator.  This integrator also did projects in those other countries (India, Pakistan, etc.) that also reported cases of stuxnet.",t1_c11bcmm,1286243232,Don_Quijoder,t5_2rmpy

Universal Healthcare being one.

I think a lot of Americans who would like to see universal healthcare are a little concerned about how it might be implemented. For instance:

How I would not like it done: I have a friend in British Columbia who has severe migraines to the point where she cannot work some days, and the amount of bureaucracy that she had to go through in order to see a neurologist was truly staggering. This same province has many people who are effectively uninsured due to a lack of capacity in that area.

How I *would* like it done: another friend of mine lived in Korea and has a chronic back condition. His has herniated disks bulging into clusters of nerves in his back. It's bad.

When he lived in South Korea, the cost of all of his medications as sold to him through the government insurance programs was &lt;$10/month. His medications to cope with the pain include lyrica and methadone. Though I cannot remember his figures exactly, his bills for his medications are greater than his rent, not including some of the experimental therapy they're giving him (something to do with injections of a steroid and lidocaine).

In Korea, his medications were cheaper, and he never encountered any issues with capacity with in the healthcare system. Medications are largely paid for by the state in ridiculous quantities but you pay full price for things like annual physicals. You pay to be enrolled but it's a pittance compared to American insurance. I think that's what I would like to see.",t1_c11doj0,1286243848,MC_Cuff_Lnx,t5_2qzb6

Islamic doctrine is subdivided into two components:

1. Qur'an
2. Sunna

Sunna is further subdivided into a written component called ""ahadith"" and the oral component.  So the unwritten culture is part of the Islamic Sunna and is part of the Islam according to the Islam.

So right off the bat you get it wrong.  Unlike with some other religions you cannot cleanly divorce the Islamic doctrine from the culture.

&gt;I live in the UAE (I am dutch), and I realized that the burka and stuff are all cultural things and what is mentioned in the quran is up to your interpretation how far you are going to cover yourself. 

Of course the Qur'an is only part of the picture.  You need to take further recourse to the ahadith, and then to the word of the scholars who are considered authoritative in their interpretations, and who rely on oral transmissions, on their own intuitions and their own inductions, as well as on the written records of ahadith and Qur'an to make their pronouncements.

You can't really divorce the burka from Islam.

&gt;The reason there is distress, is because some immigrants decide to live on welfare and support their families back home. Islam does not tell to do this. They do this because they want to take advantage of the advantages the government gives them. It has nothing to do with Islam.

Would they feel free to take advantage like that if it was Islamic government they were raping?  I bet they feel more OK in taking advantage because it's the heretics and unbelievers they are fucking over, which is OK.

&gt;Its like Mexicans in the USA, I would say..

It's nothing like Mexicans in the USA.  Mexicans in the USA take all kinds of back-breaking jobs.  Sometimes they die on the job because they are worked so hard.  They eat garbage food and scrape their pennies.  They receive no assistance from the government, unless they get sick and come to the emergency room.  Employing Mexicans is illegal for both the Mexican in question and for the businessman as well.  Mexicans who get in ""trouble"" with the immigrations authorities have no legal weight in USA, since they have no citizenship.  They are practically always deported if discovered.  (I've never heard of a case when a known-illegal Mexican immigrant was allowed to stay even after his or her identity was discovered by the Immigration and Naturalization Service or police.)

In every single Mexican neighborhood I've been, I can walking without fearing for my life.  Police and medical services can easily and without fear for their lives enter into Mexican neighborhoods and perform services there.

Mexicans haven't killed any film makers and there are no cartoonists using witness protection program to hide from them.

The fact that he got close to them to set the fire without ending up dead or in the hospital clearly indicates that they weren't Africanized. Tell the kids to play in the front yard or just stay away from the swings for a few days (rarely more than two or three). No need to cordon off anything. Hell, when I was growing up I had *red wasps* actually nesting in the wall of the house we lived in, which was also my bedroom wall. I never got stung once, and they're aggressive as fuck and have no disincentive to sting, as bees do. We just knew to avoid playing up close to that wall of the house in the summer and I kept an eye out where I stepped in my room. Compared to wasps, bees are the happy, chilled-out stoners of the stinging insect world. I played in fields humming with bees. My mom fed honeybees honey off of her finger while we watched. I stood nearby as she harvested honey, wearing half-assed gear, and was never stung once and she only rarely.

You're frothing like bees are some sort of malicious force of nature with the single solitary goal of terrorizing anyone in a 3 block radius, but nothing could be further from the truth (unless they're Africanized, and then you'd be right). But a European honeybee a swarm is just not that big of a deal. And they absolutely wouldn't make a hive right there - there's no structure to build the hive in (unlike wasps, bees need an enclosed, protected area like a hollow tree or a beekeeper's super and can't just built a hive hanging off of a pole). 

And even if they did find a nearby tree to live in, they're relatively peaceful and harmless neighbors, their noise being about the most intrusive aspect of their existence. Unless the bees are Africanized (again, already established as not being the case here) people only get stung if they smash a bee, step on it or break into/destroy their hive. I've stood in the middle of busy bee-swarmed flower bushes with bob knows how many species of bee (including tons of honeybees) swarming all around me paying me no attention at all. Move slowly enough so they can avoid flying into you (i.e. calm walking speed) and they'll never bother you at all. If they moved into a wall of the house and were actually coming into the house, that would have been a potential issue if the kids were too young to avoid them, but if that were the case they could have been easily removed by a beekeeper, with the family watching on in complete safety. 

The only reason I would ever recommend someone destroying a swarm is if the hive were Africanized and therefore highly territorial, aggressive and who attack en masse. There's just no safe way to deal with them. But barring that, even if someone was deathly allergic, a quick call to the local extension office would turn up a beekeeper or two eager to come out and box a regular swarm and you'd be a hell of a lot safer doing that than burning the swarm alive (just about the only other thing likely to provoke an attack) and leaving many homeless bees now hanging around indefinitely looking for their queen (instead of moving on almost immediately).

Clearly, bees scare you. And hey, whatever. But don't confuse your fears with what's realistic. Swarms of non-Africanized bees are harmless, temporary inconveniences at most, inconveniences that can be easily and safely avoided with minimal attention and who are no threat to anybody except those who are most severely allergic. Worst case scenario, you get a bee sting. Big whoop. I've had a few in my life, mostly wasps but a few unlucky bees I didn't see before stepping or grabbing a door handle.

There are some differences, sure.  First of all, ""white"" is not a scientific designation.  On the other hand, you can scientifically pin-point some patch of land geographically with great precision and you can talk about a certain time interval occurring on the land with reasonable precision.  You can't really talk about what's happening to ""white"" people though.  Where do white people start?  Are Italians white?  How about Spaniards?  How about North Africans?  How about North Indians?  Etc.  There is no clear demarcation of ""white"".

There is a good chance I've got some Genghis Khan genes in me too, since he's been known to sow his seed left and right and he's conquered half of Russia for a very long time.

Exactly.  So what's your history then?  Is ""white history"" your history?  How about ""Native American history""?  Isn't that also your history?  So then how can we talk about these histories as if they were so clearly compartmentalized?  I just think race is perhaps a part of the narrative, but I wouldn't put it anywhere near the title of the book, so to speak.

&gt;I just don't get bothered by the term ""white"" because its merely semantic and is simply usually referred to as including all ethnic europeans (including Spaniards and Italians).

Me too.  When we use the term ""white"" in this sense, it is purely colloquial and is used purely for convenience.  It refers to the look of the people, and I have no problem with that whatsoever.

But my attitude changes when people start talking about ""white history.""  That's different.

There is no white history.

&gt;However the term ""white"" in itself doesn't bother me anymore than the term ""black"" does even though ""African"" is a better term.

Yea.  I actually like black and white as terms, because they're simple and humble.  ""African"" is more fancy-pants, and it's also a distortion because someone who is a 7th generation black American is by no means African.  So black refers to the general looks and so does white, and I have no problem with people pointing at me and saying ""that guy looks white"" or ""that guy is white.""  That's just factual and neutral.  But this isn't science!  That's just a convenient way to talk about how we look.

&gt;They are just common albeit scientifically inaccurate phrases.

Exactly.  Since this ""article"" (press-release) pretends to be scientific, let's hold it to the proper standard.
