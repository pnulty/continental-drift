900 tonnes of hemp export from Canada in 2007 isn't exactly a lot.  Canada exports roughly 20 million tonnes of wheat per year.

&gt;Conclusions

&gt;Despite the merits of hemp fiber and oil, the global market has been on a downward trend and remains negligible in magnitude. Total world trade in hemp fiber and seed amounted to only $10.4 million in 1996! Processing costs are one of the largest obstacles the hemp industry faces. For example, bleached softwood pulp currently sells for about $800 (U.S.) per ton compared to hemp pulp at about $2,100 (U.S.) per ton. New processing technology must be found for hemp to be cost competitive.

&gt;Hemp profits also suffer from price volatility. Projected hemp demand, coupled with a low volume market, makes profit estimations adventurous. At current world prices it does not appear that hemp can compete on a large scale and may be confined to a specialty market until processing technology improves.

&gt;None of the large multinationals has openly supported hemp legalization in the United States. Why? Corporate America has the capacity to invest in hemp production and processing facilities all around the world. They have access to plenty of raw material and low labor costs (China and Eastern Europe) and a stable economic and political environment where hemp production is legal (the European Union). But investment in hemp processing remains negligible. For example, there are only about 20 paper mills worldwide that use hemp as a fiber source, which produce about 0.05 percent of the world’s annual paper production volume.

&gt;Again, it must be emphasized that hemp production is not the problem. It is the challenge of improving hemp processing that will open the doors of cost competitiveness. If the large multinationals can’t make hemp work in the marketplace, what type of costs and return differentials might small farmers and businesses work towards? That is the crux of the great hemp debate.",True,1425979002,,True,t3_8op6i,[deleted],1,t1_c09yezn,t5_6,,reddit.com,1243821724,0,0,t1_c09ykt6,c09ykt6

False,1,0,,"Thank you for the very congenial conversation, Lu-Tze. In regards to the first quote, I was actually referring to the attitude of another conversationalist here as we were discussing this article, today. I often do that - I address people I'm conversing with as a group - because I usually pop in on reddit to challenge a consensus which I feel is in error.

I see that you, as a scientist, are concerned about your field being on track. That's a very different atttude than I have. I am concerned about being successful in my own personal life. This is what my goal was, years ago, when I sat down and started reading some european philosophers, and then decided that I needed to take a cue from them, and start assessing things independently in the way they did.

So I form my conclusions based on my own assessment of things. I think when it comes to knowledge about the mind, I trust the things that I can deduce and induce based on my own intimate experiences with my own mind, moreso than I trust some esoteric research that doesn't seem to my sensibilities, to be well conducted.

Now, when I feel I have 

1. reached a conclusion 

2. and it has become fleshed out in my mind... 

3. and I've relied on it for some length of time  

4. and I've seen more pieces of the puzzle fall into place, 

5. and I see the benefit I have for my own life from this realisation

6. and I see other people with what I view as being a misguided consensus - which will do them, and our society, harm in the way it will lead to action

only then, will I start passionately contending the issue on a discussion board like reddit.

I am not a specialist in any field, and I certainly don't intend to speak as one. At most, I intend to plant a seed. I want my realisation and my model to be considered, and if some scientist wants to use it as a hypothesis in a study, maybe then the facts of what I say can be borne out, and recognised eventually. I rarely find someone who can convince me that I am in error. There are often specific things where I don't have enough experience - and I may get some embarassing facts wrong, but the thrust of my assertion is not negated by those facts which I missed.

I'll give you an example of seeding an idea. For years, I have recognised that children have more sensitive hearing than adults do. I remember my own hearing sensitivity changing in adolescence. I remembered how I used to be very distracted by the birds outside a cracked window when I was a kid. And I recognised that infant and toddler behavior sometimes reflects the fact that they have more sensitive ears. And I have a model for how their hearing is more sensitive - they have smaller eardrums, therefore quieter sounds can vibrate the eardrums more easily.

Now, one day, I read about this ""teenager sonic deterrent"" which first was marketed in Britain. I decided to write a piece up about this at a social news website - detailing my models about children's hearing. I received so much flak from commenters saying that I was talking pseudoscience. But, over the course of the ensuing months and years, scientists did do research using this hypothesis of kids having more sensitive ears... and as of 2009, this is common knowledge. Now, I'm not sure if my particular article had any effect in this process of seeding the idea - but I do think it is my personal obligation to share these things which I view as profound insights.

So, you see, I'm not trying to replace science with philosophy. I'm trying to do my little part to augment the work of scientists, and to seed ideas that might take root in the blogosphere. In short, I am sharing what I view to be my insights and realisations.

The vagueness is intentional. In his book, Daschle proposed an appointed body with vast powers to make the “tough” decisions elected politicians won’t make. ... The stimulus bill does that, and calls it the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research (190-192). The goal, Daschle’s book explained, is to slow the development and use of new medications and technologies because they are driving up costs. He praises Europeans for being more willing to accept “hopeless diagnoses” and “forgo experimental treatments,” and he chastises Americans for expecting too much from the health-care system.

point 3: I was countering your previous point 3 which talks about people being hit by a bus.

False,1,0,,"The truth is, comparing the Nazi holocaust to other events is *not* always unwarranted. This taboo stifles discussion, inhibits discovery of what our *priorities* should be, and it causes us to overlook certain facts and relationships and patterns.   (eg: we need to pay more attention to things that happen nearby, or ""on our behalf,"" or in our names.)   The holocaust happens to be more salient in the popular imagination and understanding -- and some aspects of it are comparable to other genocides, atrocities, and suffering that are closer to home:

In the past 500 years, perhaps *tens of millions* of indigenous people have [died in North and South America as a result of European colonization.](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22the+native+population+of+the+Americas+in+1492%22+&amp;btnG=Search) (In fact, one could argue that this has been part of an overall *pattern,* that still *persists to this day,* eg: oil exploration in S. America, or the Guatemalan genocide. (which, BTW, has CIA and even Dick Cheney involvement!)  Unfortunately, we still don't have a name for this pattern, as we do with the terms ""Holocaust,"" or ""[Porajmos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porajmos),"" or even ""Armenian Genocide."")

So, even the argument that the Nazi holocaust differs in *magnitude* from anything else, before or since, may be specious.   If anything, the Nazi atrocities are differentiated by the *compressed timescale* over which they occurred. (...but not necessarily a greater magnitude than, say, the death and suffering inflicted upon the Americas.)

Also different: The German State and German people have overwhelmingly rejected and *repudiated* ""their"" atrocities, as well as the regime that produced them.   Indeed, the Nazi state was completely dismantled.

Whereas, the United States has had continuity of its legal and political structure for more than two hundred years. And, the US population has [little consensus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_Wars) over *what* crimes have been committed against indigenous peoples on their behalf, or in their name -- or by their [antecedent governments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Phillip%27s_War), over the last several hundred years.

False,0,0,,"Germany's Federal Constitutional Court has warned that the extraordinary powers contained in the European Union’s Lisbon Treaty overrides all national laws in Europe!!

The German court will shortly call for an ‘emergency brake’ provision to be included into the German constitution to prevent an EU dictatorship.

The development is all the more shocking because till now, Germany has been one of the most fanatically pro-EU countries in Europe. 

It also reveals precisely how far Gordon Brown and the Labour Party have dragged Britain into the EU mess without considering its implications and without granting the people of this country a referendum on the topic.

The Federal Constitutional Court, which is Germany’s highest court, is to question a European Court of Justice ruling that a new law on data storage does not need to be approved by all member states for it to come into effect. 

This ruling has important implications for all national European laws, the German court has now said.

According to an article in Der Speigel, the EU Court has demonstrated that “there are no limits to the Eurocrats’ claim to power.”

The EU data storage law made by the EU Court requires that telecommunications companies throughout Europe keep telephone and Internet usage data on file for six months to make it available for criminal prosecutions.

The EU court ruled that the issue of data storage is less pertinent to fighting terrorism than to the European single market. 

It therefore used a simple majority to make the ruling. 

Normally, a unanimous vote is required if the measure falls under the EU’s crime and judicial affairs pillar, but a ruling on the ’single market’ only requires a majority decision.

Using this simple ruse, the EU court has therefore sidestepped whatever restrictions it might have had. By classifying topics under different categories, it can simply enforce any law it wants — and the German Court has seen this trick for what it is.

Der Speigel says “judges at Germany’s highest court have learned just how difficult it is to have the last word in Europe. 

It’s a cunning line of argumentation which effectively allows the court to intervene in many different political spheres within member countries” and added that the German “judges were visibly indignant when discussing precautions designed to impose limits on such trickery in the future.”

As a result, the German court will call for significant changes to German parliamentary law to counteract the Lisbon Treaty’s “sweeping authority that would give Brussels new jurisdiction at the expense of national parliaments,” Der Speigel says.

“The power of disposal over primary law that the (Lisbon) treaty would grant the EU’s bodies could also be described as the EU’s ‘jurisdiction over jurisdictions,’” said German judge Udo Di Fabio, who has been charged with drawing up the ruling.

This would amount to a kind of “self-service” mechanism by which the EU could expand its own powers without recourse to new treaties and such a mechanism would be difficult to reconcile with the provisions of the German constitution, Judge Di Fabio has said.

According to Der Speigel, the Lisbon Treaty openly encroaches on national authority. It gives the following example:

“Under the Lisbon Treaty, the EU can define certain criminal cases, such as those involving terrorism, human trafficking or cyber crime, as ‘transnational.’ But, ‘depending on developments in criminality,’ the Council can expand the EU’s jurisdiction to any other aspects of criminal law as soon as there is a possibility that they will become transnational — in other words, virtually always.

“The potential conflicts are foreseeable. For instance, it would be difficult to persuade the Dutch that assisted suicide should be a crime. It would be just as hard to convince the Germans that hashish should be decriminalized. The judges on Germany’s Constitutional Court were troubled by such provisions,” wrote Der Speigel.

As a result, the German judges are focussing their efforts in order to “come to grips with the dangers of the Lisbon Treaty at the national level,” the magazine continued.

They could require the German parliament, the Bundestag, to incorporate a kind of ‘emergency brake’ into their constitution. This would require the consent of the Bundestag to be linked to the consent of the federal government, and grant the German parliament the right of veto of the government if it relinquished certain powers to the EU.

The German court has also expressed its concern about the unification of European resources which is part of the Lisbon Treaty. “What happens if, as the Lisbon Treaty provides, one high-handed member decides to speak for all 27 EU countries?” Der Speigel wrote. “Because ‘the music of globalization is playing’ at the World Trade Organisation, the judges argue, the issue of who has the say there cannot be irrelevant. 

They fear that even the German water supply could be sold off one day in what Di Fabio calls the WTO’s ‘bazaar atmosphere.’”

The issue goes beyond even that, the German court judge has said. “All areas of domestic and legal policy where competency is transferred to the European bodies under the Lisbon Treaty would be exempt from the unanimity requirement. 

Even worse, the European Council can also decide to apply the majority vote principle to decisions that would normally require a unanimous vote.

“If that happens, Germany could simply be overruled, such as on the question of joint military operations abroad. The only safeguard is that the decision on which mode of voting to apply — a majority or unanimous vote — must be unanimous.

“But, the judges asked astutely, does the confusing treaty also make it possible to simply do away with the unanimity requirement when it comes to expanding the EU’s competencies?” Der Speigel pointed out.

And this is the mess into which Tory, Labour and Liberal Democrats have dragged Britain? An EU super monster that has appropriated to itself the right to determine all national laws?

The British National Party is the only political party which has consistently opposed the EU super state right from the very beginning, unlike the fake “UKIP” party which has as its candidates at least three people who are on public record as having supported the EU and its infrastructure.

There is only one party which has an unblemished record on the EU: the BNP. Voters can use the coming election to express their opposition to the Lisbon Treaty by voting BNP.

Because Arab Muslim expansion was undertaken with the explicit goal of destroying local religious and cultural traditions and assimilating them all under the tent of a singular, monolithic Arab-Muslim sphere, while Jewish communities historically have stridently aimed for a harsh degree of separateness from their host communities, and in many cases excommunication and exile was the punishment for intermarriage with non-Jews, until recently. 

Come, now. It's not hard to see how a population brought into a singular, homogeneous empire and cultural sphere could assimilate far more genetic diversity in a century, let alone 7, than a population who has long been chastised and famous for the  degree of exclusiveness they practiced relative to the dominant culture of their home nations would in 2000 years.

False,10,0,,"&gt; **there is now a fairly large body of scientific literature that indicates that circumcision is protective against some STDs.**

Sigh...

There is a study that shows [female circumcision reduces the risk of HIV](http://www.ias-2005.org/planner/Abstracts.aspx?AID=3138).

**Anyway, keep in mind that the HIV studies involve men making a decision for themselves; this does not lend support to neonatal or childhood circumcision without medical cause.**

**STDs are not a matter of child care**; therefore, even if this were true it should have no bearing on deciding to circumcise a child; most people start having sex nearly 2 decades after birth [at the age of 17 years](http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/fb_ATSRH.html).

Ever since the UN's studies on HIV in *third-world Africa*, HIV/AIDS has replaced the ridiculous UTI scare-tactic for promoting circumcision. However, safe sexual practices are not only essential, but they are the only reliable and effective means for controlling and avoiding sexually transmitted diseases; even though the UN's studies attempt to suggest that circumcision reduces the incidence of HIV infection, the UN still acknowledges that only sex education and sexually responsible behavior (such as using condoms) are effective solutions.

In fact, [one meta-study of those UN](http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/120747249/abstract) studies suggests that 72 circumcisions are necessary in order to prevent one case of HIV infection. In conclusion, the researchers make a half-hearted endorsement of the procedure:

&gt; Male circumcision is an effective strategy for reducing new male HIV infections. **Its impact on a population level will require consistently safe sexual practices to maintain the protective benefit.**

Even the authors of the [original study say so](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29882368/):

&gt;  However, it must be emphasized that protection was only partial, and it is critical to promote the practice of safe sex

(BTW, some variation of that article has been appearing since 2007; someone's trying a little too hard in my opinion; also, I've heard that some of the researches are Jewish, so not exactly unbiased).

Also, [consider research](http://www.bio-medicine.org/medicine-news-1/Role-of-Circumcision-in-Reducing-HIV-Risk-Still-Unclear-27082-1/) that shows circumcision does not decrease the risk of contracting HIV for gay men. Then consider [a study](http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/MeetingAbstracts/ma?f=102180172.html) that shows many gay men engage in astonishingly unsafe sexual practices.

Clearly behavior is the determining factor.

**Furthermore, the U.S. has the highest rate of circumcision among industrialized nations (not considering, say, Israel), and [yet the U.S. HIV incidence rate is something like 3.5 times higher than that of the closest advanced industrialized nation](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/HIV/).**

More to the point, [these studies provide no biological theory](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29882368/)---they are strictly statistical analyses (fraught with a number of confounding variables):

&gt; Why circumcision **may** reduce the risk of infection is not entirely known. But researchers **think** cells in the foreskin of the penis may be susceptible to HPV and the herpes virus.

In fact, [a study of the U.S. military](http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/MeetingAbstracts/ma?f=102282676.html) concludes:

&gt; After adjustment for demographic and behavioral risk factors lack of circumcision was not found to be a risk factor for HIV (OR = 0.9; 95% CI: 0.51, 1.7) or STI (OR = 1.08; 95% CI 0.52, 2.26). The odds of HIV infection were 2.6 higher for irregular condom users, 5 times as high for those reporting STI, 6.2 times higher for those reporting anal sex, 2.8-3.2 times higher for those with 2-7+ partners, nearly 3 times higher for Blacks, and 3.5 times as high for men who were single or divorced/separated. Conclusions: **Although there may be other medical or cultural reasons for male circumcision, it is not associated with HIV or STI prevention in this U. S. military population.**

In other words, behavior is what is important.

Consider an [*Israeli* report](http://www.ima.org.il/imaj/ar03feb-11.pdf) that devotes an entire page discussing the relationship between circumcision and cervical cancer (that is, HPV). They reference numerous studies that show no connection between circumcision and rates of cervical cancer. Their conclusion in this section is:

&gt; Although the dispute over the association of circumcision and cervical cancer in various populations is still ongoing [23,24], there seems to be no hard evidence that circumcision prevents its occurence in Jewish women, and it is no longer considered to play a protective role.

Their conclusion:

&gt; While ritual circumcision is still practiced widely, today only a minority of Jewish women observes the laws of Niddah [sexual laws]. Sexual habits have also changed considerably, becoming far less stringent. In spite of these trends of the last four to five decades, the population-based incidence of of cervical cancer in Israeli Jewish women has not increased and remains very low... it seems that there may be indeed something in ""race.""

In other words, Jewish women are protected by culture and maybe even genes---but certainly not circumcision.

Also, [according to this](http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/menshealth/facts/circumcision.htm):

&gt;  Circumcised men are more at risk from penile warts than uncircumcised men, and the risk of developing penile cancer is now almost equal in the two groups. Therefore, routine circumcision cannot be recommended to prevent penile cancer.

Consider that no medical institution in the world endorses neonatal circumcision beyond the notion that it *may* have benefits. In fact, **none** of the following medical societies or associations advocate infant circumcision (they point out that there are no prophylactic or therapeutic reasons that justify the surgery on healthy boys):

* American Academy of Pediatrics
* American Medical Association
* Pediatric Urologists Association
* American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
* National Institutes of Health
* American Cancer Society
* Canadian Pediatric Society
* Canadian Medical Association
* Australian Medical Societies (any)
* European Medical Societies (any)

Consider [what Finland's Central Union for Child Welfare had to say in 2003](http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/finland2003/):

&gt; The Central Union for Child Welfare considers that circumcision of boys that violates the personal integrity of the boys is not acceptable unless it is done for medical reasons to treat an illness. The basis for the measures of a society must be an unconditional respect for the bodily integrity of an under-aged person.

&gt; Circumcision intervenes in the sexual integrity of a male child causing a permanent change in organisms and has consequences pertaining to both health and quality of life.

&gt; The circumcision of girls is rightly considered as inhuman mutilation of the genitals and is punished abuse. Also boys must be guaranteed a similar protection by law.

&gt; According to the opinion of the Central Union for Child Welfare in Finland nobody has the right, on behalf of the child, to consent to operation, violating the bodily integrity of the child, if it is not done to treat an illness. According to the Child Welfare Act the child has a right to special protection. The Child Custody and Right of Access Act bans the subduing and humiliation of a child.

False,0,0,,"&gt;The main difference is that processing corn syrup is a much more elaborate, expensive process.

I'm already aware of how white sugar is made, and I'd hardly call it a simple process, especially the process of purifying it. I'd hardly call it cheap considering it takes a lot of energy to remove the moisture from cane. Right now, most cane crops are still burned before it can be harvested, and at least in Brazil, the bagasse from the cane is used as fuel to dehydrate the sugar. I don't consider using enzymes to change starch into sugar that elaborate, but even if it was, it wouldn't bother me.

&gt;The rest of the world uses sugar for a reason.

They use corn syrup in Europe, and other countries. They call it isoglucose in Europe. The process although not invented in the states, was developed in the states where we can grow corn over a much larger area than cane. 

&gt;It would be simpler and cheaper to just import our sweeteners, or perhaps grow GM beets.

Of course it's cheaper, it's harvested with near slave labor. Brazil is trying to wean itself off of that kind of labor, and mechanize the process.

The argument is doing something sustainable. Europe cattle farms for example. Bovines eat grass but grass take more space than corn or soy. So cattle are force fed corn, soy, rye and what not. And Europeans don't even have space to grow soy, forget grass. They export their cattle feed from Brazil. And what goes down to grow soy in Brazil? The Amazon rain forest! The equation is quite scientifically simple. The more higher up the food chain you feed on, the more waste of resources occur.

False,1,0,,"&gt;If I had to guess I would say that right to life is self-evident. Part of the human condition. It is wrong to murder an adult because it deprives them of life, when that is one of the fundamentally accepted and revered privileges given to human beings.

So why is it permissible to kill, say, cattle?  Why is the line drawn at human beings?

What I mean to say is, why is human life so precious?

&gt;I said you were almost asking people to downvote you. I was wrong: you were literally asking people to downmod you. And with such contempt! You wonder why you don't get real responses.

It was obviously a facetious request.

&gt;Religion and extremists are not bijective. That is to say both imply the other. Extremists may be religious, but that is NOT to say that religion implies extremism!

Abortion extremists are always religious.  There is literally not a single case you can point me to where religious arguments are not the underlying justification for the extremist position.

I understand perfectly well that other kinds of extremism do not require religion.  But not extremism as it related to abortion.  Abortion extremism is, without exception, a field occupied only by the deeply religious.

You can have your extremists who think their retarded classmate are dumbing down the gene pool and go on shootouts through their highschool.  That doesn't require religion.

You can have extremist economic theories which impoverish millions.  That doesn't require religion.

Abortion extremism, though...  No.  You do not have a single example, or even what I'd consider a reasonable theoretical framework for the existence of, an atheist doctor-killer.

You then launch into a multiparagraph rant about how extremism is not solely a religious domain, as if I ever said it was.

We are talking about abortion.  Not national sovereignty or reactions to Zionism or ethnic/tribal disputes, which can and do have irreligious motivations underlying them.

We are talking about abortion, so I will disregard this strawman.

&gt;Pro-Life is not an issue in other religions like it is in Christianity in America

That's not true at all.  Catholics in South America have placed extreme limits on abortion, and in Ecuador getting an abortion lands a woman in jail.

In most other places in the world, either the religious community is sufficiently secularized to the point where abortion isn't even a contentious topic (most of Western Europe), or it's illegal and thus nothing for the religious to have to rally about (the entire Muslim world).

&gt;As a side note: It's very easy for you to say that all clinic bombers are religious. It's a markedly religious issue, and most Pro-Life insano people are religious. Of course you will find that most are religious.

Not most.  All of them.  Every single one who has ever participated in violence against an abortion provider, without exception.

&gt;And also, I don't think that you will argue with me when I say that most religious people are not this brand of extremists!

Of course.

&gt;And most would condemn such an action, and indeed their faith preaches to condemn such an action. 

Yep.

&gt;How can you say that they shield extremists by fostering their religion?

I think I've already explained that quite well.  Feel free to scroll up.  I'll only add that I am certainly not saying that religious moderates are complicit in these deaths to nearly the same degree that religious extremists are, only that they do share a part of the blame by creating an environment where the motivating, fundamental core of doctor-killers is unable to be exposed for the superstitious nonsense that it is.

&gt;I am not putting words in your mouth or rephrasing your arguments.

Except you did.  Multiple times.

&gt;You claim that you do not say that religion causes violence, yet cite it as one of the two common threads of abortion violence (with the obvious in absurdium of humans), and you also say that without religion, extremists don't exist. You are directly equating the two, whether you like it or not.

You are attempting to paint me as using a post hoc ergo propter hoc.  I am not.

All abortion extremists are religious.  Not all religious are abortion extremists.

That is all I've ever said.  I left off the ""abortion"" adjective before ""extremist"", but I guess I have to be more precise.

&gt;If you are not saying religion causes violence, then why does it matter that the extremists are religious? It's a self-defeating argument, don't you see?

It matters because the religious beliefs need to be undermined, which is the action that moderates refuse to allow to happen, which is the entire point of my initial argument.

&gt;From your other posts, you demanded that people name atheists who are Pro-Life, called me a liar when I came out as one (!), and and then further, that we name any people who are atheist Pro-Life clinic bombers (very difficult indeed to establish intent). The fact that I can find any exception completely defeats your argument. That is why I was doing it.

It's not difficult to establish intent.

Find me a single user of violence against abortion providers who didn't attend church.  Even that would be a *stupendously* easy thing to do, given that one can practice religion without going to a church at all.

&gt;Logging of all phonecalls and emails and internet traffic.

The Interception Modernisation Programme (IMP) is a CESG-driven initiative to maintain capabilities set up a long time ago as part of ECHELON. Although CESG report into the Foreign Office, domestic interception requires the support of the Home Office, therefore Jacqui Smith as Home Office secretary is needed to support this. She doesn't really have much of a choice as the capability and requirements are defined by a AUSCANZUKUS agreement predating her tenure according to a European Parliament investigation.

Outdoor CCTV was originally trialled in Bournemouth under the Thatcher administration in 1985. The Major administration brought CCTV to local towns through the 'CCTV: Looking Out For You' report in 1994. Again, Michael Howard was the driver behind this. CCTV installations are not the responsibility of the Home Office but local authorities and other departments (e.g. DfT for speed cameras etc.)

&gt; Behind a law suspending Habeas Corpus as an anti-terrorism measure.

It has been possible to detain someone without charge (at least in England and Wales AFAIK) for 4 days for as long as I remember. This was increased to 7 days by the Terrorism Act of 2000 (Jack Straw), 14 days by the Criminal Justice Act (David Blunkett) and 28 days (John Reid). I don't reject that Smith looked to extend it, but Habeas Corpus has been off the British statute books for a long time.

This was introduced by the Major administration in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, although the taking of DNA from people without prior convictions was introduced in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE).

Unless these have the file extension of .EXE or of .COM, wordprocessing under DOS could never begin. The reason is that only .COM and .EXE files entertain a strange relation to their proper name. At the one hand, they bear grandiloquent names such as WordPerfect, on the other hand, they bear a more or less cryptic (because non-vocalized) acronym such as WP. The full name, alas, serves only the advertising strategies of software manufacturers, since DOS as a microprocessor operating system could never read file names longer than eight letters. That is why the unpronounceable acronym WP, this posthistoric revocation of a fundamental Greek innovation, is not only necessary, but amply sufficient for postmodern wordprocessing. In fact, it seems to bring back truly magical power; WP does what it says. Executable computer files encompass, by contrast not only to ""WordPerfect"" but also to the big, empty old European words such as ""Mind"" or ""Word"", all the old routines and data necessary to their self-constitution. Surely, tapping the letter sequence of ""W"", ""P"" and ""enter"" on an AT keyboard does not make the Word perfect, but this simple writing act starts the actual execution of WordPerfect.

False,1,0,,"I am glad to see you actually follow the actions of GM instead of just assuming something.  

There are limits to economies of scale.  You can only lower prices on manufacturing until there is no margin for the manufacturers. When that happens, the seller either has to get a new supplier, or be stuck.  It is possible for manufacturers to play the whole ""loss leader"" thing as well. They can manufacture something for a loss for Walmart in order to keep their business for something else.

Loss leaders work for companies like WalMart. They bring people in the doors to buy one thing, and end up buying something else too.

Sony was successful using their greater capacity and resources to force other people out of the VCR business, but I never disputed that instance.  What I do dispute is the idea that that approach is possible with everything else.  You are using one example, then bringing up other examples (WalMart -- McDonalds) which have nothing to do with market share by itself.  It has everything to do with scale.  

GM was not operating at a profit. That is the most important thing you do not seem to grasp.  They hoped to gain enough market share to magically become profitably.  This was happening during Rick Wagoner's time as CEO.  They were being strangled by the contracts, and this was the way they thought they had to get out of it.  GM made a bleeding fortune investing the pensions of their employees since at least 2000. That coupled with the margins on trucks and SUVs is what was allowing them to stay in business.  

This is my point: Unless market share can drive down manufacturing costs, market share will not bring anyone to profitability.  If you operate at a loss and try to force other people out of business so you can then raise prices, you will be prosecuted by the DOJ or the EU for ""unfair business practices"".

You, for some reason, do not understand why a company boosts scale. Scale allows for cheaper manufacturing, if processes can be made more efficient. Scale will also allow for fewer people on the payroll per unit.  There are limits to this. You can not force manufacturers to operate at a loss indefinitely.  

Companies boost scale to drive down costs. They boost market share because it is a metric investors understand.  Getting the two confused for each other is a sure way to get to bankruptcy.  Profitability is what companies should strive for above all else. ",True,1425979853,,False,t3_8ouzr,SuperConfused,1,t1_c09zy1c,t5_6,,reddit.com,1243991742,0,0,t1_c0a0chd,c0a0chd

False,1,0,,"&gt;The fact that you're even attempting to justify the settlements says a lot about one's thinking.

Certainly. It says that one is willing to see that there are **two sides** to the issue. Anything that affects so many people adversely needs to be justified. Not trying to justify the fence/wall is just as wrong as declaring that no justification would be enough. The jury is still out on whether or not the fence/wall damaged more lives than it saved, as you pointed out. I'm not saying that the wall was the right move; rather, I argue that decrying it without consideration otherwise is certainly flawed logic.

&gt;Even if the piece of land was a trash dump, Israelis have no right to it.

The one settlement was on *purchased* land. The others, maybe not. I think that grants them a bit more than ""no"" right.
Please distinguish between ""no"" and ""less than [someone else.]"" Not doing so places you on the uncompromising side of a discussion, which is always bad, and you seem to at least glance at more than just one perspective.

&gt;The marked decrease coincided with Hamas's entry into legislative politics and their increased role in governance

As did an increase in the number of rockets fired into Israel. When bombs and snipers don't work as well as they used to (with a fence/wall in the way), rockets are the next logical step. Maybe you're right, and maybe [Hamas's charter (2007)](http://europenews.dk/en/node/3488) hints (or rather declares that ""[The final goal of Hamas is that the flag of Allah will fly over every inch of Palestine](http://europenews.dk/en/node/3488)."" This excerpt is from over a year and a half after Hamas won elections, though [of late](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas#History) Hamas *has* improved somewhat. 

&gt;Either way, the wall's location is the reason people are protesting it

I never even considered it. You make a good point. I had thought that the protests were more a result of being severed from their livelihood and, to a lesser extent, being cut off from superior Israeli schools, infrastructure, and medical care. Hence I gain a new perspective; thank you.

&gt;Apparently you believe they're entitled to the entire land.

From what premises did you draw this conclusion, so that I may try to convince you otherwise? There is a reason that I brought up the **two**-state solution. (And responding that I think that the second state should be elsewhere is not allowed, because that's not true either. Apply recursively to this statement.)

&gt;More than half of their country just went POOF! So what were the Arabs supposed to do?

Attack the newly formed Israel in concert of course! Losing to the new Israel was not in the plan. Then, the only response was a war every decade.

I note that the current demands for a return to 1967 borders are in fact asking for *less* than was offered in 1947. And this is *acceptable* to the Palestinians, desired even.

It is very difficult to answer your question. I can only try to answer it with an example: one day, half of Israel just went POOF! And to whom? The very people who did everything they possibly could to prevent Israel from coming into existence. Some Israelis were outraged and committed despicable crimes, such as (in a later land-for peace trade) assassinating his Prime Minister. But overall, Israel was happy to give up over half its land for the prospect of peace. The Israelis took what was given them and tried to make the best of it. Had the Arabs behaved in that manner, they would have more land than the now demand. But I can say that with the benefit of hindsight. In short, I really don't know, but any number of sensible people could have pointed out that planning a war was probably not the best answer.

&gt;Even Ben Gurion recognized the injustice of the whole situation.

Ben-Gurion, who suggested to the Jews that they colonize as much (uninhabited! desert!) land in the Negev as possible so that the UN would offer more territory to Israel, tried to set an example (which wasn't followed) by farming the Negev himself. Given that he recognized the injustice of the situation, I will point out that every Israeli has to balance the significant injustice to the Palestinians and the significant injustice to his country, which has been under attack from day negative 365. And it's not easy, since the situation is more or less the prisoner's dilemma. The argument that you find dishonest would have left both parties better off. 

Take a look at the history of peace deals. Unless what I've found is horribly off, Israel has done a somewhat better job of sticking to the agreements. Though Israel was nowhere near perfect, there is a reason that Israelis protesting the return of a Palestinian government argued that it would be ""another Oslo.""

A friend of mine is a Polish hobby pilot who flew to Warsaw frequently before they joined the EU, and he was never controlled upon landing.  

Whether guns go in the public eye or not is also largely irrelevant; smuggling brings in what there's a market for.  If there's a market for guns (and there is), guns will be smuggled.  You can mitigate the damage, step up border patrols, increase punishment, reduce socioeconomic incentives for gun crimes, etc, but you will never remove the influx of weapons into any country.

Furthermore, as I said elsewhere, protection against criminals is only part of it.  Gun ownership is an unapologetically (and justifiably) paranoid deterrent against government or societal overreach -- something the EU might be wise to consider.

False,-1,0,,"&gt; Everybody is different, so we will never have an objective answer.

No. It's objective.

Firstly, circumcision removes a minimum of what would be 15 square inches of tissue. This is not 'just skin'. It contains special parts like the preputial sphincter, the inner foreskin, the ridged band, and even muscle. The inner foreskin (that which contacts the glans directly when pulled over) is not even skin; it is mucosal tissue that is much more sensitive to touch than the outer foreskin (that is, shaft skin). To get the idea, compare lightly touching  your wrist (beneath your palm) and then the forearm.

Circumcision removes a minimum of 20 thousand erogenous fine-touch receptor nerves that *complement* (not just add to) the coarse-touch recetpor nerves of the glans penis (the head of the penis). This is more than twice the number of nerves that the clitoris has to offer.

Moreover, the slack that the foreskin provides creates a protective and stimulating sheath that glides up and down the shaft; the glans penis, inner foreskin, ridged band, and frenulum are all stimulated as the shaft and glans penis slide into and out of this sheath. Again, the result is not more sensitivity, but *enhanced* sensitivity.

Think of circumcision as a downgrade from color television to 1950s black and white television; it's still pretty cool to watch *I Love Lucy*, but it pales in comparison to the HD, cinematic entertainment of today. The foreskin provides more information to the brain, allowing the brain to better control and enjoy the sex act.

Circumcision destroys the gliding sheath, removes the innervated ridged band, and reduces or removes the inner foreskin and frenulum (the latter of which is a very erogenous region called the ""Sex Nerve"" in Europe); I say ""reduces or removes"" because circumcision is not uniform and the results depend on the whim of the practitioner and on the way the penis grows during puberty (assuming circumcision before puberty)---many American and basically all Jewish circumcisions completely remove the inner foreskin, replacing it with just the shaft skin which lacks erogenous response.

Clearly this amputation alone removes 'sexual perception.' But the damage doesn't stop there. The glans penis (the head of the penis) and any remaining inner foreskin are transformed into fully external organs, which is unnatural for these mucosal tissues. They dry out, like lips dry out and require chapstick, though the result is not broken skin but a layer of keratin that protects the nerves from stimulation. The natural exposure to clothing causes this keratin to thicken with age, resulting in lifelong desensitizing. Also, the exposed glans is more susceptible to more painful abrasions and some circumcised men complain that they cannot bear walking without tight underwear (boxers are just too abrasive for them); indeed, men with whole penises are instructed to expose their glans penises to clothing if they want to desensitize their genitals.

The loss is not just for men, either. [One study](http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/ohara/) found that---statistically---6 out of 7 women prefer intercourse with men who have whole penises, which is not surprising given that our genitals evolved together over millions of years.",True,1425979954,,True,t3_8pc02,LordVoldemort,-1,t1_c0a0in1,t5_2qh2p,,atheism,1244013780,0,0,t1_c0a0k7d,c0a0k7d

I was downvoted multiple times for stating the obvious fact armed self-defense culture was one small factor amongst many influencing crime rates. And, TBH, if anyone thinks that increasing gun ownership is the best way of tackling ""the root causes of crime"" there is no other word for them.""

Try and correlate [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_murder_rate) list of murder (can we treat this as a proxy for crime for simplicities sake?) rates by country with the number homes that keep a loaded weapon accessible. If we compare just China and western Europe to the US, Africa, and South America I think we'll see that guns are if anything correlated with higher crime rates. I'd rather not argue that (although there's no shortage of people who do), but at very least you'll have trouble proving the opposite.

On the other hand, cultural norms, history of colonisation, immigration, and most of all economic inequality look very strongly related to crime rates.

I don't doubt that concealed carry and so on can drop crime rates a few percent, but the *huge* differences in crime rates between South Africa and Sweden is a lot better explained by their history and social and economic make-up than by trying to shut the gate with a shotgun well after the horse has bolted.

[70%](http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/malecircumcision/JC1320_MaleCircumcision_Final_UNAIDS.pdf)-75% of the Earth's men are intact. Circumcision is only common in the U.S., South Korea (because of the U.S. military presence in the Korean War), Israel, the Muslim world ([68% of circumcised men](http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/malecircumcision/JC1320_MaleCircumcision_Final_UNAIDS.pdf)), and the older generations of Canada and Australia (both of which were influenced by the U.S.). **Outside of these countries/*cultures*, 'routine' circumcision is considered bizarre---even cruel.** [In Canada (2005)](http://www.cirp.org/library/statistics/Canada/), only 9.2% of boys were circumcised. [In Australia (2004)](http://www.cirp.org/library/statistics/CandNon-C/), only 12.7% of boys overall were circumcised (in some parts only around 4%). [Even in some states of the U.S., only a minority of boys are circumcised](http://www.cirp.org/library/statistics/USA/staterates2004/). Consider 2004: Nevada (14%), California (21%), Arizona (25%), Washington (26%), Oregon (30%), Florida (39%).

Consider that no medical institution in the world endorses neonatal circumcision beyond the notion that it *may* have benefits. In fact, **none** of the following medical societies or associations advocate infant circumcision (they point out that there are no prophylactic or therapeutic reasons that justify the surgery on healthy boys):

* American Academy of Pediatrics
* American Medical Association
* Pediatric Urologists Association
* American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
* Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
* National Institutes of Health
* American Cancer Society
* Canadian Pediatric Society
* Canadian Medical Association
* Australian Medical Societies (any)
* European Medical Societies (any)

In 2006, the government of Finland outlawed the circumcision of healthy boys (including in hospitals) without their adult consent. Consider [what Finland's Central Union for Child Welfare had to say in 2003](http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/finland2003/):

&gt; The Central Union for Child Welfare considers that circumcision of boys that violates the personal integrity of the boys is not acceptable unless it is done for medical reasons to treat an illness. The basis for the measures of a society must be an unconditional respect for the bodily integrity of an under-aged person.

&gt; Circumcision intervenes in the sexual integrity of a male child causing a permanent change in organisms and has consequences pertaining to both health and quality of life.

&gt; The circumcision of girls is rightly considered as inhuman mutilation of the genitals and is punished abuse. Also boys must be guaranteed a similar protection by law.

&gt; According to the opinion of the Central Union for Child Welfare in Finland nobody has the right, on behalf of the child, to consent to operation, violating the bodily integrity of the child, if it is not done to treat an illness. According to the Child Welfare Act the child has a right to special protection. The Child Custody and Right of Access Act bans the subduing and humiliation of a child.

It's more common than you think, at least in Western European countries. Most high-class escorts make way more money than I do as a software engineer and stay escorts because it's an easier, better paid job than anything else they could do and it allows them to do whatever they want, buy whatever they want, travel anywhere they want, etc. It's really a job; some like it, some others don't.

And even for the unhappy ones, they are unhappy not because of sex, but because of the circumstances under which they have to do it, just like I'm happy when I drive my car but wouldn't if I were forced to drive while somebody points a gun at me. The fact some unhappy cases exist doesn't mean it's all unhappiness and to be avoided. Even if prostitution was all wrong, that'd a minimal part of sex. You can enjoy sex with your loved one, or with friends, and ignore prostitution ever existed. 

Sex is a wonderful thing when you do it out of your own free will; it feels great and is also good for health as proven by recent scientific works; don't let anybody make you think otherwise. Ultimately, your body is exclusively yours (heh, it's the last thing they can take from you) and what you do with it is solely your own business.

The reason why religions don't want you to have sex is that it far more often than not makes you happy. Some religions go as far as to make you feel sad for things your ancestors supposedly did (such as killing Jesus), and consider a sin to have too much fun and pleasure. The basis of this is simple: the happier you are, the less desperate you are, the less you'll be looking for some sort of a better afterlife, which is what they sell, and the bigger a sinner they make you feel, the more you'll want ""salvation"", which they also sell. They use unhappiness and the feeling of guilt in order to control the masses.

See how the countries with happier people - those with low unemployment, high paying jobs, lots of leisure time and activities, luxury, good health services and good education, are far more prone to have atheists, and even those who aren't, are far less radical with their beliefs. Almost nobody born in Western Europe or Japan is a religious extremist, and some of these countries have a very high ratio of atheists (estimated up to 30% in France, for example). At the same time, the poorest countries where people lives much harder lives are far more prone to religious fundamentalism. Religion feeds from unhappiness and sorrow, and offers inexistent goods - ""salvation"", ""heaven"", etc. in return for control over people's lives.

So here's my viewpoint. I've written a book on this subject and have been optimizing sites for a long time (I generated over $50 million in incremental revenue for one well-known site).

This site took Paypal yet only a miniscule portion of orders came in through it. They were in a commodity business and experienced massive growth rates (now selling over $100 million/year online). I believe this was because of the way we did things made the payment method virtually irrelevant (e.g. once you accept credit cards, you are pretty much all of the way there).

The second highest used payment method was electronic checking, which was chosen most often in Europe. About 1% (tops) of the orders came in through this method. I believe we actually would have increased sales by eliminating this payment method because it caused users to have to fill out an extra form (and we had huge dropoff at that point).

I contend that PayPal is only going to make a difference on micro-payment sites, as well as sites catering to very young users. Businesses such as ring tones, games, etc. Removing it, in my experience, may actually even boost sales.

False,0,0,,"&gt; Yes. I also know that the vast majority of the ethnic cleansing that took place in 1948 was of Palestinians.

Actually, no. More jews were ethnically cleansed from arab countries in years preceding 1948.

&gt; Even before the Arab armies you mention, 250,000 Palestinians were cleansed from the urban centers of the Israeli half of the UN partition.

Since the UN partition plan has been rejected by arabs, they have no right to claim that land for which they have no ottoman deeds ""belongs"" to them by the mere fact that they're mentioned in the partition plan.

&gt; This is basically the view of Israel only. No one else takes it seriously. It was not the US policy. It is not the view taken in the Mitchell report. And the US State Department uses the words Occupied Territories. Sorry, bub. Reality, meet MikeSeth. MikeSeth, meet reality.

If you want to talk about reality, this view is irrelevant and Israel will not comply to it. To say that land called Judea somehow ""belongs"" to arabs is absurd. No one has tried to enforce this illegitimate view, and it is not recommended that they try. Nuclear warheads, meet anonymous-coward. Anonymous-coward, meet the principle of sovereignty.

&gt; I'm sure we can find Sudanese sources that use various legalisms to defend the atrocities in Darfur, or we could dig up Saddam's c.1992 legalisms that Kuwait was really a province of Iraq, or we could find that the Soviets defended their invasions of Eastern Europe as internal matters. But such arguments aren't the general view. There's an ""International"" in ""International Law"".

Yes, there is. And it doesn't say anywhere in international law that West Bank and Gaza are (or ever were) occupied territories. If they are occupied territories, then the correct procedure would be to return them to the sovereign nation to which they belong: Jordan and Egypt. They don't want them. So, what we're being asked to do under the guise of ""returning the occupied territories"" is in fact ""turning over disputed territories."" Even the presumption of ""palestinian"" in ""occupied *palestinian* territories"" is invalid. Nothing makes them ""palestinian"" other than the fact that they used to belong to an administrative unit called Palestine. While it is a protected right of the palestinian arab population in West Bank and Gaza to not be displaced, they have no right to displace (or demand to displace) other people.

It seems you, being partisan towards liberal/democratic politics (which is okay if you want to bitch the rest of your life), do not understand the essential problem with modern US paradox: the celebrated 'pragmatism' practiced by both sides of the political spectrum generally hurts the greater welfare of the masses. Whether it's nonpartisan efforts like the voting for the Iraq War, the bailout, or the patriot act, or partisan efforts achieved with a majority like covering the Federal Government's ass by not releasing photos of children being raped by US officials. What people call pragmatism on the part of Obama is for pure political gain or for political legitimacy. How and how long Obama supporters convince themselves that he is not an establishment hack is what I will be following the next seven years.

And if you want to talk about fear mongering, then remember Obama using the word ""catastrophe"" as a descriptor for what would happen if the stimulus package was not passed. That was before he it was passed without any legislators having to time to read it all, and before he took a four day vacation before signing it.

Anyone who calls for an overhaul and increase in government to help the masses A) does not understand who controls the government B) might assume that Europeans are content with government taking greater control of their lives, which is flat out wrong, and C) is an idealist for his/her belief in a government ""for the people, by the people.""

I'm not really interested in your political ideology, and I'm not sure anyone else is either. I now have to explain my political stance, or lack thereof,  because of your false, random, baseless assumptions of my own.

As far as ""fixing a corrupt system,"" don't look for that idealism here. I know 'democracy' deserves to be in mock quotations. I've run far away from the liberal politics I was enraptured in two years ago, and in that process of unlearning any liberal idealism, I have not run towards conservative politics. I'm as apolitical as you can get, even anti-political. I'm only interested in pointing out hypocrisy for those who can handle it, which is why I made my original post on this board in the first place. If Iam forced to explain my own philosophical approach to existence, as though people's philosophies are ever followed seriously, I say that I am a nihilist with absurdest tendencies. 

The fact that Obama has been swallowed by so many ignorant people who should know better is demonstrative of the phenomena that 21st century 'Democracy' (oligarchy) through the perfected technique of mass propaganda is the superior devise for collectively manipulating global masses towards the acceptance of smothering tyranny.

&gt;[Cannibalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibalism) was widespread in the past among human beings throughout the world, and it continued into the 19th century in some isolated South Pacific cultures. Today, the Korowai are one of very few tribes still believed to eat human flesh.[2][3] Neanderthals are believed to have practiced cannibalism.[4][5] Among modern humans it has been practiced by various groups;[6] in the past in Europe,[7][8] Africa,[9] South America,[10] China,[11] India,[12] New Zealand,[13] North America,[14] Australia,[15] Solomon Islands,[16] New Caledonia,[17] New Guinea,[18] Sumatra,[19] and Fiji,[20] usually in rituals connected to tribal warfare. Fiji was once known as the 'Cannibal Isles'. Evidence of cannibalism has been found in the Chaco Canyon ruins of the Anasazi culture.[21]

False,11,0,,"Judging by the first paragraph, I don't find the case too solid so far.

&gt;The fact that so many books still name the Beatles ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe.

Well, Beethoven *is* probably the most famous classical composer today; and even in his time, he *was* one of the most influential, successful, and well-known composers in the world.

&gt;Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success: the Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest.

That's not at all the reason why rock critics rank the Beatles as the best.  They *were* very successful, but that's not why they were good, it's the other way around.

&gt;Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers.

A contemporary rock critic who is reviewing the Beatles *is* reviewing the rock music of the past.  And most rock critics tend to appreciate the 50s, 60s, and 70s as the best era for rock.  Look at Rolling Stone's ""500 greatest albums of all time"" list: almost all the albums on the list were from the 60s and 70s.

If the Beatles were a *contemporary* band that's successful, I could see this argument being made (those critics are just following success and don't know the classics of the past)... but the Beatles *are* the classics of the past.

&gt;No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worth of being saved.

&gt;In a sense the Beatles are emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole: too much attention to commercial phenomena (be it grunge or U2) and too little attention to the merits of real musicians. If somebody composes the most divine music but no major label picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of rock critics will ignore him. If a major label picks up a musician who is as stereotyped as one can be but launches her or him worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on her or him.

Again, not true.  Rock critics a) tend to prefer the classic stuff to modern music which they rightly deride as trash, and b) when it comes to modern music, they prefer obscure indie bands to the overproduced popular trash.

Scaruffi might be looking more toward *pop* music critics, rather than rock critics...  They're guilty of a lot of what he's saying.

The big difference between today and the 60's-70's era is that the bands that were *good* back then were also the *successful* bands.  Some of the best rock music in history comes from very *successful* artists from the 60s and 70s: The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Don McLean, Pink Floyd, Bob Dylan, Eagles, Iron Butterfly, etc.  Today, success and quality often seem to be inversely correlated, as can be seen by the success of Nickelback, Linkin Park, Green Day, and all their ilk.",True,1425980258,,False,t3_8pfvw,[deleted],11,t1_c0a14hh,t5_2qh03,,gaming,1244064179,0,0,t1_c0a15vz,c0a15vz

but back to the real point - how exactly is gun ownership 'inextricably necessary' for defense? you can only defend yourself with a gun? there are no other ways to do it? isn't a gun just going to aggravate a lot of situations? 

i'm not proposing some unrealistic utopia in saying that gun ownership shouldn't be necessary either, gun regulation is very strict in most western european countries. you're the one being unrealistic in your *dys*topian view that gun ownership is 'inexorably necessary' for defense.

The Federal Reserve is mostly a private conspiracy and I don't see how you can stop things like that until you make political bribery illegal. You can remove the Reserve, but that's not going to get the actual money out of congress, therefore it will not stop the influence of wealthy bankers on the government, it will just shift it around some.

The US had a steady series of economic crashes before we invented banking regulations, so up until FDR we've had a steady series of banking failures and economic crashes. 

WW2 was hardly a 'European war'. You definitely need a history lesson based in reality vs conspiracy. 

Income tax is vastly more fair than flat taxes which move more tax burden to the middle and lower classes. Again.. you need more education before just repeating sound bytes. Proportional taxes are BY FAR the way to go because a health economy has to provide opportunity not just endless wealth for the wealthy. 

Here.. read this at least..

The chief of the bipartisan National Monetary Commission was financial expert and Senate Republican leader Nelson Aldrich. Aldrich set up two commissions — one to study the American monetary system in depth and the other, headed by Aldrich himself, to study the European central-banking systems and report on them.[4] Aldrich went to Europe opposed to centralized banking, but after viewing Germany's banking system came away believing that a centralized bank was better than the government-issued bond system that he had previously supported. Centralized banking was met with much opposition from politicians, who were suspicious of a central bank and who charged that Aldrich was biased due to his close ties to wealthy bankers such as J.P. Morgan and his daughter's marriage to John D. Rockefeller, Jr.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve

You see bankers owned congress therefore blaming the government when you clearly allowed it to be bribed by the wealth is just sheer stupidity. Until you regulate political bribery you cannot hope for any better.

When it comes down to it the Federal Reserve was made in an attempt to stabalize American banking, which had been through an endless series of failures and attempts at central banking for over 100 years before the Federal Reserve Act.

It's not as if this idea came out of nowhere and for no valid reason. If you lived during that time you would also have wanted some type of reform but been hard pressed to pin down exactly what, hence a public-private institution that allows for flexibility.

Roosevelt and the joint chiefs were actively drawing up plans to provoke a Japanese attack.  Military exercises, oil embargo etc.  The joint Chiefs actually released an 8 point plan for how to provoke war with Japan.  And, outside of Japanese aggression, it was a European war.

""You see bankers owned congress therefore blaming the government when you clearly allowed it to be bribed by the wealth is just sheer stupidity.""

It wasn't just bribery but actual alliance in the case of men like Aldritch.  But yes, it required historical ignorance as well as backroom deals to get such a radical delegation of power, so strongly opposed by Jefferson, Franklin and others.  Indeed the famed silver monetarist Bryan was not sure it was a bad idea.

""When it comes down to it the Federal Reserve was made in an attempt to stabalize American banking""

I totally disagree.  It was an attempt to control the country's purse strings.  (""Give me control of a nations purse strings and I care not who writes it's laws.""  -Some Rotschild).  If it were  an attempt to stabilize the country it was beyond miserable and should have been abolished after the crash of 1929.  Volatility in GDP was, as a whole, significantly lower on average prior to 1913.  This says nothing of the biggest crash in US history less than 2 decades after their inception.  A crash in which the personal fortunes of Morgan, Rockefeller, Kennedy and others all multiplied by their advance knowledge gleaned through their business relationships with the Board of Governors.

""The real failure of the Reserve is not the idea itself,""

From a moral perspective its parasitic, adding nothing of real value, only manipulating the value of that already in existence.

From a functional perspective it was a massive failure.

Constitutionally it is highly questionable because nowhere does the constitution give congress the right to delegate authorities granted to them.

This study is biased and badly researched. Daling claims the study “revealed the connection between use of smoking marijuana and cancer aggravation.” This is a disrespectful blow to the many groundbreaking studies proving the phenomenal medicinal qualities of cannabinoids in marijuana.

Why doesn’t Daling instead implicate ddt, chemical fertilizers and pesticides on food and tobacco, mercury, lead, methamphetamine, caffeine, alcohol, jet and car fuels, depleted uranium, pharmaceutical medications and/or high fructose corn syrup in this study, as they have all been linked to serious health issues… mainly strange and specific cancers.

This study effectively disproves itself as Daling then stated “that as they analyzed the data on the study, they found out that no evident relationship exists between smoking marijuana and cancer, specifically testicular cancer.” Yes, exactly, because there IS NO LINK between cannabis and cancer!

However I listen to metal, jazz, soul, reggae, prog rock, folk, you name it! i'll even listen to the Beatles. But the Beatles were genre specific -they were pop- and are musically a tad boring for many people. 

You must understand, before the Beatles we still had Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, Handel, Wagner (the list goes on), Billy Holiday, Louis Armstrong, Chuck Berry (the list goes on) and a whole lot of other musicians -American and European -  who were as important to the rise of the Beatles as the Beatles are to today's music.

Immersed in such an expansive field of talent and musical diversity, the Beatles are a little bland, musically speaking. (take note of the quantity of songs that are written in pure Major/Minor keys as opposed to the more discordant/minimalist/elaborate keys; not to mention time signatures 2/3/4/8 is about  all Ringo could handle)
If you want to address the fact that they were great writers, i'm sure anyone can give you a comprehensive list of better writers, better poets, better songwriters - just look at any country's traditional gems for example. 

My point is the Beatles were a step in a ladder of musical development and not the pinnacle. If they were the best at anything it was that they were the first band to run like a corporation and hence had enormous resources at their disposal to create the more elaborate later material.

They were also the first band to reach such enormous success on a global scale, however this coincided with the proliferation of the technology of music recording and distribution to the rest of the world. None of this puts them above any of the composers /musicians /genres i've mentioned, it just means they are there as part of musical history. As for appreciation, that is only an issue for the listener and anyone is free to dislike what they hear. I don't dislike the beatles, but i hear them and i hear where they got the music from, i hear the influences on them and i often find those influences a tad more interesting. 

As for music that came after the beatles? I don't really like the mainstream, which is what they influenced the most. Other than that i think vlance's comment about tolkein above sums up my view on that.

Not true - I never said any such thing.  Clearly, there was grave importance to all of the peripheral theaters.  Barbarossa, however, was clearly the main event.

Is it inaccurate, or speculation?  Please make up your mind.  Going with speculation, I'm personally not able to imagine realistic scenarios of where the US could have a successful amphibious assault against a Europe with many times more Axis forces in the West than were historically there, politically withstand the million+ dead required to make it to Germany, and also supply this vast army at the rate needed when the Germans (in this scenario) have clear access to materials to the East (and possibly from the Middle East - no Barbarossa likely means that Rommel would have had the men and gasoline to mop Wavell away).

Communist authors were prolific, and most of them were engaged in a sort of perverse and dangerous game of seeing who could slip the most subversive literature past the censors. It was great fun trying to find hidden meanings in this poem or that novel.

 * Official communist propaganda was so obvious and in-your-face that it was laughably easy to resist. A McDonalds ad is more persuasive than the infamous communist ""brainwashing"".

 * Education was free (including college), and 100% secular.

In 10 years of school, nobody had ever mentioned god or religion in any of my classes (or in any public space for that matter), not even in passing. In fact, religion was something so alien to me that to this day I don't really understand why people need it.

False,2,0,,"Okay, here's a serious answer: while it is true that the overall standard of living in civilized countries has increased dramatically (based on whatever arbitrary 'objective' standard you want to set), historical trends are very tough to get away from, since they are so strongly informed by the base natural instincts of human beings which really haven't changed all that much.

You look back through history where you see cycles of oppression, revolution, subjugation, repeat, repeat, repeat.  Those with power try to hold on to it and concentrate more of it to themselves and their kin.  This eventually breaks when the 'people' find a leader and overthrow the regime, you can look at the Senate taking back control of Rome after the time of Nero, you can look at Oliver Cromwell vs. the British Monarchy, revolutions in most European countries over the centuries, the American Revolution, it's always a case of the oppressed people finally getting fed up and striking back at the monarchs and oligarchs.  Everything is just fine for a little while but eventually the new ruling class gets used to having power and becomes corrupted by it.  They once again begin the process of concentrating the power to themselves more and more until you're right back where you started a century earlier.  The dance might look a little different each time but the song always remains the same.

You could argue that FDR gave the power back to the people in America, and ever since then the Republicans have been slowly re-subjugating the middle class until the last couple of years where the Executive became extremely imperialistic, they and theirs made lots and lots of money while the rest of us suffered, and eventually we got fed up and handed them electoral drubbings in '06 and '08, but not before they sucked the economy so dry that we're on the brink of another Great Depression.

The biggest difference is that transfer of power in America is peaceful.  There are no bloody coups or public beheadings (just assassinations), and that's really the only difference.

You cannot argue that there are many places where diving and simulation are tactics commonly used in soccer.  If you are an American football fan and you watch Cristiano Ronaldo play, you will be outraged.  It just isn't part of our sporting culture to simulate injury for the sake of getting a foul called.  I play in a league here in America, and the S. American and European players are far more likely to dive and fall on the floor holding their ankle.  It is frustrating because it is unsporting and unfair.  I can certainly see how American football fans would find this unappealing.  I fucking hate it, especially as a defender.

I am a huge soccer fan and I play.  I know that it can be a very dangerous game and people can get serious injuries.  You see a lot of serious knee and ankle injuries.  However, there is still a culture of simulation which negativly reflects on the game.

&gt;which is a pussified form of rugby, complete with padding all over the body.

Rugby and American football collisions are different.  If the guys in American football didn't wear pads they would die and suffer serious brain injuries every game.  If that is what you want then I don't know what to say.  There are players every season, even with the pads, that suffer career ending spine, neck, and brain injuries.  Not to mention the myriad of serious knee injuries and bone breaks associated with the game.  

To conclude, most contact sports, whether its rugby, football, or soccer, are very dangerous and serious injuries happen.  Even with all the padding though, pretty much every NFL player will suffer a serious injury before they are done.  Running backs last an average of 2 or 3 seasons before they get serious, career threatening, injuries.  It is a very brutal game, moreso than soccer.  That doesn't mean it is better, I don't think it is.

I got the idea that this was to make fun of the Tiananmen massacre from [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/8pnl8/it_was_20_years_ago_today_reddit_can_we_have_a/), which was the origins of the logo.  The entire thread was China bashing.

Now i suppose that chinese people are extremely sensitive about their nationality, heritage, and country because for a long time, china was basically the bitch of the European nations.  For while, the european nations stepped on china and cracked jokes with china as the butt.  Hell, when china sent their first olympic athelete to San Francisco for the Olympic games, he got laughed at by just about everyone.

I do believe that this is why chinese people are so sensitive.  For a long time they've been the laughingstock of the world, and when they finally start their climb up the ladder of society, they get laughed at and ridiculed/critisized even more.

This was why the Olympic games in beijing was so important to us.  For chinese people around the world, it was finally the proof that china was a world power and should be respected.  That's why china went all out on the ceremony, so they could show the world that they were truly a great nation.

Now, i see that you've been downvoted, but i didn't downvote you (i reserve that for trolls and spammers, not people i disagree with, check the greasemonkey script if you want), but i'm guessing that you were downvoted because quite frankly, the last two paragraphs were insulting (in my opinion).

You're telling Chinese redditors to start making comments saying that the massacre was wrong or else be considered blind apologists is very offensive.

I do believe that i've been extremely civil and polite (if you believe i haven't, feel free to point it out), and i do hope you'll extend the favor.

Let's just quickly examine the fundamentals :  What is offshoring suppposed to do, and who is it supposed to do it for ?

What is offshoring supposed to do ?  It's supposed to increase profit

How ?   By significantly reducing labour costs

Why ? More profits means bigger bonuses for execs, higher stock prices and bigger dividends for stock holders on wall st.

Does it do that ?  Yes.  Although rising quickly, Labour costs in India are around 1/10th of those in the US and Northern Europe.  That's not 10% lower, or 50% lower.  They are 1/10th.  You can have 10 Indians to 1 local. 

Is it successful ? Yes.  Every single large corporation takes advantage of lower labour costs in the develop world.  Every single one.  From the clothes you wear and the food you eat to the car you drive and cellphone youd choose almost everything you touch has low cost labour in.  The strategy is ubiquitous.

Is it  bigger/better/faster/easier/higher quality/more friendly/more productive/more efficient ??  **No**.  None of those things.  It doesn't have to be and it doesn't claim to be. It's just cheaper. 

Is YOUR job  managing a project  going to be harder because it's reliant  on offshore resource ?  Probably.  But since when has your job been of any significance to a share holder, or CEO waiting on a bonus

For that matter, Mr. Zakaria argues that we are now in the midst of the third great tectonic power shift to occur over the last 500 years: the first was the rise of the West, which produced “modernity as we know it: science and technology, commerce and capitalism, the agricultural and industrial revolutions”; the second was the rise of the United States in the 20th century; and the third is what he calls “the rise of the rest,” with China and India “becoming bigger players in their neighborhoods and beyond,” Russia becoming more aggressive, and Europe acting with “immense strength and purpose” on matters of trade and economics.

False,2,0,,"&gt;However, even if we take all of that inefficiency out, we'd still be paying approximately as much per capita as most European countries.

Spending as much per capita on healthcare as most European countries would be a drastic reduction in US healthcare costs.  The US spends $[4,178](http://tinyurl.com/o5skz9) per capita, whereas even the most costly healthcare in Europe (Norway) is only $2,425 per capita.  That is far more than a 30% difference.

Unless you have figures to back it up, I don't buy the argument that medical costs in the US are due to comparatively high research.  First, every industrialized country conducts medical research, the EU and Japan in particular devote a large amount of resources to it.  The US certainly does more, but not all of these research costs translate directly into medical costs.  Second, drug costs in the US are not well represented by research costs at all.  Pharmaceutical research is heavily subsidized through our government, in the form of public universities who either directly carry out the research themselves or who accept grants from pharmaceutical companies to test drugs using taxpayer funded labs.  Third, a very large portion of the most expensive drug research done in the states is directed at new formulations of old drugs with the express purpose of creating new patents so that pharmaceutical companies can continue milking the same cow after the old drugs go generic.  This expense does basically nothing to increase quality of care.

I don't claim to have ""the solution"" to the mess of the US healthcare system.  I can say that when Canada faced our exact same problems they turned to a single payer system which dramatically lowered their costs and provided universal coverage.  The system has been in place and working well for 35 years now, and their [primary healthcare indicators](http://www.yesmagazine.org/article.asp?ID=1503) show that their care is *at least* as good as ours and probably better.

After seeing the success in Canada, Taiwan copied much of the system to their great benefit.  In 14 years they have reduced their number of uninsured from 40% to less than 1%, and they now have the [lowest medical administrative costs](http://tinyurl.com/dlwte5) in the world.  Currently the popularity of the healthcare system in Taiwan is around 70%, whereas in the US hangs around 40%.

There are many potential ways to improve the US healthcare system, but moving to a single-payer model and reforming our patent laws would be a big step in the direction of a more efficient system with lower costs, higher quality of care, and universal coverage.

My thoughts are that birth rates in the UK are low because people can't afford to have kids in a safe and decent environment -- houses have been difficult to afford and most people have to get mortgages to be able to afford a house.

I think this is related to immigration -- more competition for jobs means wages are depressed and many native British people end up on the dole (= welfare).

I've had my fair share of LSD-esque random crap dreams - one that sticks out in my mind is a dream where I had to repair a little reentry pod in a huge space shuttle that seemed to be made entirely of long copper tubing. After repairing the tubing, I hopped in and was teleported, not launched, into a strange urban environment, sliding through it a la rail shooter, surrounded by Banksy-ian graffiti and skyscrapers that seemed to literally scrape the sky. This dream was easily the most colorful I've ever had, more colorful than a flower garden. Especially the graffiti. It all felt so unnatural. 

Now what's most strange is that I dreamt this all out of order, although I 'felt' where everything was supposed to be chronologically. I started out flying through the street, repaired some tubes, felt the explosion of a shuttle, then took a trip climbing up the tube-ship into the reentry pod...it was a mess. A fascinating mess. I tried explaining it to a friend when I woke up and she was utterly confused. Oh well.




I've had a couple of dreams where I sexed up teachers, although that falls more into the 'disturbing' category, rather than the 'hot' one. My mind isn't nearly as exciting as other peoples in this regard.


There was one pretty awesome dream where I was ascending an infinitely tall staircase - like the Mario 64 one. Except each step I left would fall into the abyss of space. And it was damn cold. I distinctly remember this dream taking forever for me to finish. It turns out that I left the fan on and the room was colder than normal.



Hm. Nightmares. My nightmares seem to always involve restraints of some kind. When I was quite young, I had a dream where I was shackled to a hardwood floor and devoured by large insects. And I've had a few dreams where I get tortured. 


In one particularly creepy dream, had acted as a witness for a crime of some sort, and testified. The person was convicted and received a life sentence - but the person's cronies didn't like that. They took four hostages, and then proceeded to 'christen and kill' three of us and use the last one to exchange their friend out of prison. I was the first to go. So about six screws in my hands and legs later, I willed myself to wake up. All the while, this distinctly Slavic-east-European (sorry, euro-redditors) looking guy wearing a black wife beater and black jeans (sorry, black jean-wearing wife beater-wearing redditors) was whispering nursery rhymes in a different language, apparently trying to calm me down.

False,1,0,,"It is true that the UK and Canada spend less on health care per capita.  Some of this is due to the tremendous waste in the U.S. health system (e.g., 1/3 of what we spend is due to costs of processing claims through insurance companies and government programs).  Some of this is also due to the UK and Canada controlling the incomes that can be earned by physicians, hospitals and other providers, which has an impact on the quality of care.

The U.S. is clearly superior to Canada or the UK in terms of successfully diagnosing and treating people with serious illnesses like cancer, diabetes and heart disease (despite our handicap of nearly 50 million uninsured). [Here](http://mjperry.blogspot.com/2007/10/us-cancer-survival-rates-are-lowest-in.html) is a chart by a University of Michigan professor on cancer survival rates in the U.S. versus the UK and the EU.  Below is some information about UK and Canadian health care versus U.S. health care from U.S. economist John Goodman:

**UK versus U.S. Health Care:**
&gt;Britain has only one-fourth as many CT scanners per capita as the U.S., and one-third as many MRI scanners. The rate at which the British provide coronary-bypass surgery or angioplasty to heart patients is only one-fourth the U.S. rate, and hip replacements are only two-thirds the U.S. rate. The rate for treating kidney failure (dialysis or transplant) is five times higher in the U.S. for patients between the ages of 45 and 84, and nine times higher for patients 85 years or older. Overall, nearly 1.8 million Britons are waiting for hospital or outpatient treatments at any given time.

**Canadian versus U.S. Health Care:**
&gt;The proportion of middle-aged Canadian women who have never had a mammogram is twice that of the U.S., and three times as many Canadian women have never had a Pap smear. Fewer than a fifth of Canadian men have ever been tested for prostate-specific antigen, compared with about half of American men. Only one in ten adult Canadians has had a colonoscopy, compared with about a third of adult Americans. These differences in screening may partly explain why the mortality rate in Canada is 25 percent higher for breast cancer, 18 percent higher for prostate cancer, and 13 percent higher for colorectal cancer. In addition, while half of all diabetics have high blood pressure, it is controlled in 36 percent of U.S. cases, compared with only 9 percent of cases in Canada.

Yeah that might have been because of the geography or it could be you know crazy monarchs followed by crazy communists.

On to China:
&gt;Simply avoiding periodic starvation requires a high level of state planning and coordination

Or it might be that China's fertile geography enabled an ancient and advanced civilization and such huge and dense populations that tiny fluctuation in food supply can lead to great numbers of people starving.

&gt;Additionally, the southern half of the country has a subtropical climate, riddling it with diseases that the southerners are resistant to but the northerners are not. This compromises the north’s political control of the south.

And that's why the confederacy won the civil war!

My argument is that it doesn't represent all Israelis and it's not clear it even represents MOST Israelis.  But it is also not some small insignificant group.

The fact is, you can easily go out on the Internet and find hundreds, or thousands of examples just like this.  Just as you can Muslims calling for ""Death to Israel"" or ""Death to America.""

These are not ""fringe"" opinions and that is why that region festers so badly.  There are enough radicals out there to keep fanning the flames.

What I hate about this issue is even people not involved always step in and make things worse by making comments which are either accurately construed as, or distorted as (on a case by case basis) anti-Semitism or anti-Palestinian.

This is a deeply complex situation involving multiple issues of land, religion, ethnicity, and history, and everyone seems to have this pat explanation of ""who is at fault"" and ""how to fix it.""  And any even remotely intellectually honest approach to this issue will make it hard to side with either party here.

For me, personally, wrong is wrong, and ultimately I am an individualist.  Both sides in this issue have a strong collectivist mentality whereby it's us and them, and if one, say, Palestinian, throws a rock, then it's ""The Palestinians"" throwing rocks, or if the knuckleheads in this video say a bunch of stupid ugly crap, then it's ""Israelis,"" or, even worse, ""Jews.""

I have been interested in this issue all my life.  As an American of Roman Catholic, but Eastern European extraction (with no Jews or Muslims anywhere in my family on either side - the most exotic it gets is Russian Orthodox), I don't really have a dog in this race, except as an American and our involvement.

I took classes in college where I watched a sea of turbans on one side of the lecture hall and a sea of yarmulkes on the other side, like some kind of demented segregationist circle-jerk.  I watched hands shoot into the air to dispute even the least controversial ""facts"" in the history of this conflict.

All I saw was agenda-agenda-agenda.  And that's what I see today, is agenda.  People love to get their anti-Semitism on, though they hate to be called anti-Semites.  And a whole lot of Jews love to get smug about their military superiority and assert, as if trying to convince not only me but themselves, their right to take *any* action in defense of what they assert is ""their homeland.""

And then the peanut gallery has to chime in with its dimestore understanding of the situation, which inflames both sides.

It's ALL propaganda at this point.

As for me, I fucking *refuse* to treat people as anything as individuals.  This is true when it comes to dipshit American tendencies like hating the French for god knows what reason, or making broad sweeping statements about Muslims or Jews.  Likewise, there are a whole bunch of posts wherein I get pissed off at the stereotyping of Americans.  I'm tired of this kind of moronic groupthink from people who should *fucking know better*.

In my life, I have never had a negative experience with a Muslim - not one.  And I've known several.  They were reliable lab partners (you can tell a lot about a person's character by whether they pull their weight as a lab partner), co-workers, and neighbors.

I have had more issues with Jews, mainly because I lived in an area surrounded by the kind of people in this video.  It took me some time to sort out my own anti-Semitism; to divorce Jewishness from being SPOILED FUCKING BRATS.  As I got older and met Jews from other social classes, nationalities, and backgrounds, so, here, I learned to treat them as individuals.

I recall my first Bar Mitzvah, where I was taken around the catering table and introduced to the food one by one.  To this day, my #1 comfort food is your basic lox and cream cheese on bagels.  And I know all the words to Shalom Chaverim because I dig Hanukkah.  One day I realized a disproportionate number of artists, writers, and professors who had inspired me, truly helped me improve my game, were Jews, and I came to terms with the fact that my kind of soft anti-Semitism had morphed into a special esteem for Jews.

And Jews are way more sharing and way less insular about their culture and faith than the stereotype would indicate.  I rarely meet Jews who are uninterested in discussing Judaism with non-Jews, but will even invite you to check out what they do, without any kind of evangelical zeal.  And I seriously dig that and find that to be in complete opposition to the worst anti-semitic canards about how Jews tend to be insular.  Maybe Orthodox Jews, but not Reform or Conservative Jews.  Not in my experience growing up in the Northeast.

But I could only come to this evolved understanding after I started looking at people as individuals and shrugged off the preconceptions everyone wanted me to have - the simplified, lowest common denominator, throw em all in a pile way of thinking about people.

I am just suck of the collective slagging of one group or another, or the wink and nod ""Sure there are exceptions, but *most* of them...""

Ashkenazim (about 38% of the national population): Jews whose ancestors came from Germany, France, and Eastern Europe. Most Ashkenazi Jews that settled in Israel were from Russia, Poland, Romania, Ukraine, Germany, Hungary, Czech Republic,North America, South America, South Africa and Australia.

Mizrahim and Sephardim (about 38% of the national population): Most Jewish immigrants to Israel from Iran, Iraq, Yemen, and Syria are considered Mizrahim, and the term has come to refer to Jews whose ancestors lived in Arab or Muslim lands, but did not live in Spain or Portugal. The word Sephardi refers to Jews whose ancestors lived in Spain and Portugal until 1492, and sometimes until later, then spread to Greece, Italy, England, the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe, as well as into the Ottoman Empire and in North Africa. Many Sephardi Jews that settled in Israel from Morocco, Algeria, Turkey and the whole Mediterranean area are descendants from migrants from Spain and Portugal. In modern Israeli Hebrew usage, this category is often included in Mizrahim.Those with origins in Muslim and Arab lands are commonly called Sephardim by their Ashkenazi counterparts, though the majority does not descend from Iberian Jews and are best described as Mizrahi. The Jews of Iran and Iraqi Jews are always considered Mizrahi as well as the Yemenite and Omani Jews.

Italian Jews (about 1% of the national population):[citation needed] Jews whose ancestors lived mainly in central Italy. Due to its history and geographical position, Rome hosted the most ancient continuous Jewish community in Western Europe, dating back to the Roman Empire.

Indian Jews (about 1% of the national population): Jews from five distinct communities in India and also Burma, each with very different origins.

Beta Israel/Falash Mura of Ethiopia (about 2% of the national population): Jews who were initially brought to Israel during Operation Solomon and Operation Moses. Today at least 127,000 live in the country.

Stereotypes are called that for a reason. That is a fallacy; unless, of course, you can measure laziness.

Again, stereotypes. I've met honest people everywhere. (And the southeast probably has the most dishonest people, since it has the most inhabitants).

The northeast has the highest concentration of black people in the whole country -- it's where the first African slaves arrived.

Hindus, say, have a horrible caste system. How does that fact detract from the racism of Judaism?

Besides, Judaism clearly transfers Judaism through the mother for the sole purpose of making Judaism an inherited---racist---status. Just look at Israel's 'laws of return' (what a ridiculous notion, anyway).

I believe a ""Mamzer"" is *allowed* to marry a convert to Judaism...

&gt; **Ultra-orthodox Jews are crazy. But so are ultra-orthodox anything.**

They call them orthodox, because they actually follow the Torah (of course, with their own even worse additions, like Brit P'beh---an excellent name for it, by the way).

&gt; **I've always been confused by people who freak out to this degree about circumcision. I'm not struggling to have an orgasm every time I have sex because of my mutilated penis. It's...a fully functional penis.**

Black and white vision is still to be cherished over blindness.

Circumcision removes a minimum of what would be 15 square inches of tissue (see how much it is altered for yourself by viewing [these images/animations/movies](http://www.geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources)--view them all!). This is not 'just skin'. It contains special parts like the preputial sphincter, the inner foreskin, the ridged band, and even muscle. The inner foreskin (that which contacts the glans penis directly when pulled over) is not even skin; it is mucosal tissue that is much more sensitive to touch than the outer foreskin (that is, shaft skin).

Circumcision removes a minimum of 20 thousand erogenous fine-touch receptor nerves that complement (not just add to) the coarse-touch recetpor nerves of the glans penis (the head of the penis). This is more than twice the number of nerves that the clitoris has to offer.
Moreover, the slack that the foreskin provides creates a protective and stimulating sheath that glides up and down the shaft; the glans penis, inner foreskin, ridged band, and frenulum are all stimulated as the shaft and glans penis slide into and out of this sheath. Again, the result is not more sensitivity, but *enhanced* sensitivity.

Circumcision destroys the gliding sheath, removes the innervated ridged band, and reduces or removes the inner foreskin and frenulum (the latter of which is a very erogenous region called the ""Sex Nerve"" in Europe); I say ""reduces or removes"" because circumcision is not uniform and the results depend on the whim of the practitioner and on the way the penis grows during puberty (assuming circumcision before puberty)---many American and basically all Jewish circumcisions completely remove the inner foreskin, replacing it with just the shaft skin which lacks erogenous response.

Clearly this amputation alone removes 'sexual perception.' But the damage doesn't stop there. The glans penis (the head of the penis) and any remaining inner foreskin are transformed into fully external organs, which is unnatural for these mucosal tissues. They dry out, like lips dry out, though the result is not broken skin but a layer of keratin that protects the nerves from stimulation. The natural exposure to clothing causes this keratin to thicken with age, resulting in lifelong desensitizing. Also, the exposed glans penis is more susceptible to more painful abrasions and some circumcised men complain that they cannot bear walking without tight underwear (boxers are just too abrasive for them); indeed, men with whole penises are instructed to expose their glans penises to clothing if they want to desensitize their genitals.

The loss is not just for men, either. [One study](http://www.cirp.org/library/anatomy/ohara/) found that---statistically---6 out of 7 American women prefer intercourse with men who have whole penises, which is not surprising given that our genitals evolved together over millions of years.

Perhaps that's why [Moses Maimonides](http://www.circumstitions.com/Jewish2.html#rambam) (a revered Jewish scholar of the Torah, physician, and philosopher) had this to say:

&gt; It is hard for a woman with whom an uncircumcised man has had sexual intercourse to separate from him. In my opinion this is the strongest of the reasons for circumcision.

False,0,0,,"&gt;The jewish migration out of the arab states happened after jews forced out native palestinians and created giant refugee populations that burdened economies in those countries.

So your justification for the mass expulsion of Middle Eastern Jews and theft of their property (which dwarfs the Palestinian exile) is that the Palestinian refugees created an economic burden on those Arab states?

Firstly, even if this were the case, it still doesn't excuse that state sanctioned anti-semitic porgroms which often drove the Mizrahi Jews, who had nothing to do with the establish of the state of Israel, to it.

Secondly, the majority of Palestinians who did flee fled to Jordan and Lebanon, and there were hardly any Jews there to begin with- the majority of whom came from North African states and Yemen- who absorbed no Palestinian refugees at all. 

&gt;European jews are European and not some separate racial entity. I for one can't distinguish russian jews from russians.

It hardly matters what you think, as genetic and scholarly evidence clearly proves a hereditary link not only between the various Jewish ethnic divisions, but between Jews and non-Jewish Middle Eastern populations.

I would say corporatism is where the state effectively or directly controls business through regulation and other legislation.  I would also expect it to be potentially difficult to determine what is state owned, state run or otherwise state controlled.  The key though is that those businesses would not be run for the benefit of the country, but for the benefit of shareholders and that government would use legislation and regulation to favour those businesses.

False,1,0,,"I do not believe that the UK should provide the model for US healhcare.  It is not as though, by suggesting implementation of policies similar to those of Taiwan and Canada (as I have done elsewhere in this page), I am proposing that US healthcare would improve regardless of who we emulate or that every industrialized country in the world has both lower costs *and* higher quality of care than the US.  In some cases both of these are arguably true, but in some (like the UK), only one is true.

Along these lines, I do not think it is appropriate to compare the entire EU or all of Europe in a broad stroke to the US, as individual EU and European countries have very different systems and policies that do not always generate a well defined contrast to that of the US.  I would instead suggest that the analysis be limited to a country to country comparison, so that individual systems and outcomes can be compared directly.  For that reason I will address only your comparison of the US to Canada by the conservative economist John Goodman, once called the ""father of Health Savings Accounts"".

All of your data, from both John Goodman and Mark Perry, was culled by a conservative think-tank called the NCPA, founded by Goodman.  While I do not question the figures themselves, I think it is very important to note that think-tanks operate for the sole purpose of generating arguments to support preconceived conclusions in order to influence policy debate, and that much of the data chosen is extremely selective in how it is being presented and what issues are being focused on.

Instead, to engage in a broad comparison of Canada to the US on all healthcare issues I would draw your attention to this peer reviewed cross-university survey by 17 authors, conducted of 38 different studies, all comparing quality of care in the US to that of Canada. [*](http://www.openmedicine.ca/article/view/8/1)

Amongst the conclusions were the following:
&gt;These results are incompatible with the hypothesis that American patients receive consistently better care than Canadians... Canadian health care has many well-publicized limitations. Nevertheless, it produces health benefits similar, or perhaps superior, to those of the US health system, but at a much lower cost.

As for pay amongst doctors being lower in Canada and this supposedly resulting in lower quality of care.  First, there is no demonstrated link between these two factors, and as the review above indicates the conclusion not even merited.  Second, I believe that the lower pay amongst doctors in Canada is almost entirely mitigated by several factors.  

For one, US doctors pay extremely high malpractice insurance fees in comparison to Canadian doctors.  To quote:
&gt;Although physicians' insurance costs have traditionally been multiples higher in the US than in Canada, the current increases are unprecedented. In Nevada, an obstetrician who paid US$40 000 last year is expected to pay US$150 000 — Can$231 000 — this year. In Florida and New York, annual fees of more than US $150 000 are no longer unusual for obstetricians, orthopods and neurosurgeons. (In Ontario, an obstetrician's Canadian Medical Protective Association [CMPA] fees are Can$75 084, but they are only Can$15 813 in Quebec and $27 348 in the rest of Canada.)

I should note that even though it is far less than many US obstetricians, the highest fee paid in Canada, $75k in Ontario, is mostly covered by subsidies from the local government. 

Second, medical education in the US is much more expensive than in Canada.  I can attest to this personally, as my family is nearly a quarter of a million dollars in debt as a direct result of 4 years of med school at a private university and interest accumulation during 3 years of residency.  This amount is not at all unusual.[*](http://tinyurl.com/lrzh54)  Comparatively, the most expensive tuition payed in Canada is half that of the most expensive in the US, and the least expensive in Canada is one fifth of the least expensive in the US.[*](http://tinyurl.com/mdsexf)

Finally, workers in almost all industries get paid less in Canada than in the US, the medical profession is not exceptional in this regard.  While one could arguably present the case that this is solely due to the harsh burden of taxation for universal healthcare, I doubt such a case would be compelling =)  As such, the relatively lower pay of Canadian doctors is not necessarily directly attributable to the fact that they have a more efficient, lower cost, and *at least* equal quality healthcare system.",True,1425981164,,True,t3_8prg7,[deleted],1,t1_c0a2lmb,t5_2qhpn,,economy,1244238247,0,0,t1_c0a30ik,c0a30ik

You don't have to reach the actual camps to disrupt transportation to them, and Eastern Germany was pretty close already.  This is relevant especially when you consider that unlike Polish Jews, a large portion Western European Jews (for example Dutch Jews) were  being taken away on a mass scale only later in the war.  

I honestly can't say for sure whether there were any plans that involved disrupting railways before D-day, but the point with regards to the intent of Allied strategy is unchanged.  So even if you are correct and it was strategically impossible before D-day (which I doubt), there was no sense of haste for that objective.  The public and strategic justifications never hinged on *saving lives* (which is really my point here), but on kicking the Krauts out of France and saving Britain publicly, and Anglo domination of the post-war world strategically.

""it was incapable of surviving a mission in the pacific theater at the distances you blame them for not reaching.""

The USSR as a state had been sverly damaged, but the Red Army was still a far greater force than anything the western allies had fought so far in the war. The Red Army was stronger than the allied forces in europe as well. Easy air speriority is certainly optimistic too, achievable over time perhaps, but certainly not a quick or easy task.

Imagine trying to live with one eye, or one lung, or one testicle.

Isn't it equally a handicap to use only half your brain?

Conservatives - The tories, they're the same party that went up against the Whigs although obviously a lot different in policy. Again, textbook liberals pretty much.  The past 50 years or so has been alternation between Labour and Conservatives, now looks to be no different as the Conservatives are making huge gains on the back of labours losses. Cameron is their leader

Liberal Democrats/Lib Dems -  made from a merger of the Liberals (Whigs back in the day) and Social Democrats in the 80's. Again, more Liberals. In the last decade or so have been up-and-coming to form somewhat of a three party system although we haven't yet had a lib dem government and it doesn't look like it will happen anytime soon. They are likely to form the official opposition at the next election judging by Labours collapse.

UKIP - Fight for exiting the EU and bunch of other shit like bringing back the 11 plus - they just seem to wish it was 1950's Britain again. Making gains and not just in the European elections; notable hatreds include immigrants.

BNP - Our far-right wing, basically fascists 
with a grudge against immigrants. Making gains, slowly but surely regardless of both all the other parties and the media urging people not to vote for them

Greens - Moderate Socialists somewhat akin to Swedish Social Democrats and the old Labour leadership with an emphasis on Green policies. Making small gains.

There were many more smaller parties including the one I voted for in the EU elections, too many to detail here but the list above includes the parties with any realistic chance of getting MEP's/and MPs. UKIP, Greens and the BNP has no MP's; the BNP are the only party I have listed without MEPs

Well we don't really either. Labours collapse has meant two things: Conservative gains, and Liberal Democrats are the second party; not really becuase they have gained much (theyve lost councillors in the local elections), but becuase not enough people are voting for Labour to put them in front. Before now the political scene has consisted of a Labour/Conservative war for most of this century and before that a Liberal(Whig) and Conservative (Tory) war.

And yeah it is technically possible to build a large (passive) radar system which can track planes in a far distance by using the reflection in the ionosphere. The Russians had such a system near Chernobyl but it was abandoned after the reactor accident.

Top LTTE fund collectors in France try to persuade Tamil diaspora to disbelieve KP’s acknowledgement that Prabhakara had died. While the top diaspora members fight over the future strategy of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the Tamil professionals and commercial establishments in Europe have expressed disgust over ‘utterly selfish motives’ of the LTTE’s Department of Diaspora Affairs (DDA). They were referring to the DDA’s statement that the ‘LTTE leadership is safe and it will re-emerge when the right time comes.’

”The DDA has kept on feeding us stories that Tigers would fight back and deal a fatal blow to the Sri Lankan army and collected thousands of EUROs for various emergency funds,” stated Gopal Sivarasa, a trader in Tamil predominant La Chapelle in Paris. “Even last week we donated funds after the tiny beachhead of Mullaithivu was encircled by the Sri Lankan army. The DDA said that they wanted funds for missiles for the final assault which will kill ‘thousands of soldiers.’ Because we had hopes against hope, we donated as much as we could. I wonder where is all that money?” he lamented. 

Another trader, who did not disclose his name, wanted the French police to investigate into the affairs of DDA which included extortion, intimidation and money laundering. “I am sure large part of the funds went into their pockets,” he said furiously. “That is why the DDA says Prabhakaran is alive. The whole world including LTTE leaders such as Kumaran (Selvaraja) Pathmanathan knows the truth that Prabhakaran was killed on May 17.”

It is apparent that the LTTE diaspora leadership is split on future strategies. While Pathmanathan has acknowledged the death of Prabhakaran in an interview with BBC,

the LTTE’s DDA wants keep the myth alive to ensure future fund collections. The DDA got hold of LTTE mouthpiece Tamilnet, which carried a statement that “the Tamil national cause cannot afford to be deviated and exploited by others through questions such as whether the LTTE leader V. Pirapaharan is alive or not or whether the armed struggle has to be continued or not. The Tamil diaspora, the only section of the Eezham Tamil community that has the freedom and means to come out with authentic voice, has a historic responsibility in telling the world what they aspire for in no uncertain terms, and in seeing their righteous cause not hijacked by their enemies.”

It is evident hat the DDA believes that Pathmanathan is ‘hijacking’ the organization and he is ‘the enemy’.

Pathmanathan, as the head of the LTTE’s Department of International Relations on Sunday announced that the LTTE Leader Velupillai Pirapaharan attained ‘martyrdom fighting the military oppression of the Sri Lankan state on 17 May.’ However, the LTTE’s Department for Diaspora Affairs (DDA) told TamilNet that it would not comment without explicit authorization from the LTTE leadership. In the meantime, the Intelligence Department of the Tigers reiterated on Sunday that the LTTE leadership is safe and it will re-emerge when the right time comes.

The DDA has funded the election campaigns of Tamil Nadu politicians such as V Gopalasamy alias Vaiko of MDMK and Pazha Nedumaran of Kamraj Congress. Hence they immediately expressed scepticism Sunday on the reports of Mr. Pirapaharan's demise, thus supporting the DDA.

“Whoever emerges victorious in this leadership struggle, we will not donate a cent hereafter,” says Kumarappah Nathan of the phone-card shop at La Chapelle. “We have been fooled many times but we continued to contribute as long as Prabhakaran was alive and the LTTE held territory. Now any contribution is just like throwing water in the river”.

DoubleTwist violates the GPL, meaning it is an unlicensed use of a *copyrighted* work. This was obviously done deliberately and maliciously, with the intent of withholding information from humanity. Copyrights are governed uniformly under international law; while there are minor discrepancies between polities, if your nation is a signatory in the Berne Convention, the same basic rules apply.

*Patents*, on the other hand, are not governed under international law and vary quite a bit from state to state. For example, while the United States has the concept of a ""software patent"", Europe and many other nations do not. Additionally, software patents exist for incredibly over-broad and vague concepts -- if tested, it is almost certain that prior art would be found for the vast majority of them. The only benefit software patents have is in cross-licensing between monolith corporations, to protect each other from their respective lawyer clans. Newer competitors do not have anything to gain from cross-licensing, however, and are simply sued into oblivion.

Make no mistake, the copyright system, as per the ""default configuration"", is an imaginary construct (that is noted in the Constitution of the United States of America, among other places) designed to leverage huge amounts of control in ways that are, now, completely unneeded.

Having said that, this has never occurred... not even on 9/11.

The lack of redundancy you mention is not accurate. Obviously, if a satellite fails, they can't launch a replacement right away. However, there are many times when you can use 5,6,7 satellites at once, despite the fact that 2-3 is suitable for enroute nav. So this notion that one fails and you're screwed is just false.

But let's say several satellites do fail at one time... in that case, RAIM kicks in and alerts the flight crew to loss of requires navigation performance. At that point, they would revert to VHF based nav when over land, or INS/IRS based nav over water. Less accurate, but it's your backup plan.

For IFR enroute or terminal ops GPS approval, that goes to the FAA for the states and its EU equivilent in Europe. Every procedure, piece of hardware, etc all have to be FAA approved when used for IFR.

As for Labour - I agree, national politics shouldn't affect a EU election, however, I feel their stance on the EU has shown that they're not really as pro-Europe as they claim anyway, they have actively disregarded the EU Human Rights declaration, and the EU Personal Privacy declaration, the UK also enjoys a privileged position where the ruling body in the UK can choose not to implement EU laws or rules, and Labour again has shown that they will abuse that position whenever possible for their own benefit. They have shown no interest in joining the Euro, or ratifying the constitution. Thus one can only conclude that Labour is only pro-EU in words.

Had Labour had a better track record wrt the EU, I just might have felt that I could vote for them in this election in good faith, despite their national situation.

False,2,0,,"&gt;What is holding people back from sutainable transportation is that it doesn't work for anyone. We're not Europe (here in the States), and we can't all get around with trains and 'streetcars'. Sure, if you live in the big city and can take the bus, good for you; however, everything is very spread out throughout most of America, and we need those cars that GM and the others make.

That argument would work - if we really had good public transportation systems in our cities. Sure, people live out in the suburbs, and that's pretty damn far.

But take a city like Salt Lake - they've been able to build in a light rail system, with stops that match (gasp!) those suburbs. Now, instead of ten thousand cars driving 40-60 miles, now they can drive 10 to the local stop, and ride into town. Just cut down driving by some 50% that way.

People aren't saying that every single place in the United States needs to be serviced by a light rail or subway. But when we get every major city with a population over 100,000 with good, reliable, thought out public transportation, then we won't have to worry about the people who really need the cars.

And, if we work on providing those big cities - where over 50% of the country lives - with reliable, effective, cheap public transportation, then that'll reduce the gas for those who say ""...we need those cars that GM and the others make.""

Oh, but I see the problem: ""...so let the market work, instead of enacting onerous laws.""

Might help if ""the market"" was actually free - instead of being influenced by car companies that fight off any chances at public transportation by bribing (sorry, ""donating to the campaign"") of politicians. When you have people working to influence the market to favor them, then you get a situation where the people participating in the market are ill serviced. You know - the exact kind of situation that Adam Smith spoke out against, and said that government's role was to insure that such collusion didn't happen.

There is no “one Hinduism”, and so it lacks any unified system of beliefs and ideas. Hinduism is a conglomerate of diverse beliefs and traditions, in which the prominent themes include:

    * Dharma (ethics and duties)
    * Samsara (rebirth)
    * Karma (right action)
    * Moksha (liberation from the cycle of Samsara)

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi):

&gt; Ashkenazi Jews... are the Jews descended from the medieval Jewish communities of the Rhineland in the west of Germany... Many Ashkenazi Jews later migrated, largely eastward, forming communities in non German-speaking areas, including Hungary, Poland, Lithuania, Russia, Eastern Europe, and elsewhere between the 10th and 19th centuries. With them, they took and diversified Yiddish, a Germanic Jewish language that had since medieval times been the lingua franca among Ashkenazi Jews. To a much lesser extent, the Judaeo-French language Zarphatic and the Slavic-based Knaanic (Judaeo-Czech) were also spoken. The Ashkenazi Jews developed a distinct culture and liturgy; influenced, to varying degrees, by interaction with surrounding peoples of Central and Eastern Europe.

&gt; Although in the 11th century they comprised only 3% of the world's Jewish population, Ashkenazi Jews accounted for (at their highest) 92% of the world's Jews in 1931 and today make up approximately 80% of Jews worldwide.

First, let me introduce you to some of the eastern Europeans countries in eastern Europe:
Poland and the Ukraine. Thats right, open the map, they are there.

Whats surprising is that if you opened the map in 1910, and then again in 1930, and then again in 1950 you will see that the borders of those countries moved considerably. Why?
Well yes, here enters your empty basket of European history knowledge.
Austro-Hungary, which had a predominant German culture, controlled large parts of Poland and the Ukraine, in which there were millions of Jews. These jews, or most of them anyway, had NO SURNAMES up to when the Austro-Hungarians took over. So the Austro-Hungarian clerks which were very particular at their centralized bureaucracy required all jews to get a surname - so the jews at those newly controlled lands had to chose themselves names, usually they had to pay for it if they wanted a ""good name"" registered (like goldberd), or they just received whatever surname the clerk chose for them (like a friend's of mine surname, which in Germans means shit-puddle).

Let me write it to you in capital letters so it will get into your thick thick brain:
JEWISH SURNAMES HAVE MORE TO DO WITH THE CURRENT RULER OF THE LAND THAN WITH THEIR CULTURAL HERITAGE.
Thats why many Eastern European Jews have German sounding names, Mostly from the Ukraine and from Poland (which was controlled by Germany - same story there).

In fact, this practice was common in non-Jewish communities as well, if a Polish guy has a German sounding name (I am speaking of our time) - then it doesn't necessarily means he is of German decent.
Contrary to your belief, surnames != ethnic heritage, especially in places where colonialism ruled for a long time.

People come together and form a government.  then they give some of their money to the government.  the government than uses that money to do things for the people even if they didn't pay any money in.  That money is called taxes, and it's why governments work.

the trick is people who don't pay taxes still get access to goods and services payed for with taxes.  Like public schooling and social welfare programs (ie food stamps).  All payed for by taxes.

Free doesn't mean cost-less, it only means the cost is not directly incurred by the individual gaining the goods or service.

So when you go to the park and you ask someone coming out ""how much does it cost to go in?"", they say ""it's free!"".  You don't have to pay to take your kid to the playground.

Firstly, the government will continue to ""crack down"" on everything.  Fines will go way up.  Fees will be higher.  Any governmental function that can produce money will produce as much as possible.

Next the ""crack down"" will hit Medicare and Medicaid.   Cheaters busted.  Live at 11.  We will all learn that those people are causing our taxes to go up.

Then the cut backs in the military and foreign aid.  Pull out of Iraq.  Base closures in Europe and South East Asia.  Cuts in aid to the Middle East; Israel, Egypt, Palestinians, Africa.  China's role as a world power increases, with bases throughout Southeast Asia, Africa, and possibly South America.

Then a deal in which medicare / medicaid taxes are raised, including higher taxes on the wealthy, in addition to cut backs in services for the poor.

Next, all new and less than 10 years in  governmental employees at the state and federal level will be shifted to 401(k) retirements.  The deal will also increase taxes.  There will be more cut backs, hiring freezes, and layoffs in government.

Look for sales of large tracts of federal land to raise cash.  Certain environmental niceties will be ignored or papered over to bring in the bucks.

US dollars sink 25% in international markets and imported manufactured goods rapidly become more expensive.  Quick uptick in local manufacturing, but it will never be enough to cover some losses in certain rust belt states.  

Other major industrialized currencies, the Euro, the Pound, possibly the Yen, also follow.

Gas, coffee, bananas, silver, and gold all start to look awfully expensive.  Driven by large export markets, the price of beef, oranges, and corn rise.  Food subsidies are instituted to keep public order.  These are paid for via more taxes on the wealthy, and more cuts in various government departments.  Federal funding for No Child Left Behind and other controversial programs are eliminated.

Then, generally, we see large voter dissatisfaction, perhaps a constitutional amendment for congressional term limits, similar to those passed in several states a decade ago, and potentially some significant anti-bureaucracy reform in Washington.  This will especially help the poor, who are better served with direct injections of cash and  food than with paper pushers.

The net effect will be a significant reduction in American spending on foreign issues, a reduction in the size of the state and federal governments, a rise in the costs imports, and some modest political reforms.

False,4,0,,"People have and always will be tempted to torture.

Some generations will give in, others won't. Even if society is progressing that doesn't mean we can't regress for short period of time and still be making overall forward progress. 

The fact this happened makes this an interesting time to live in which will be talked about for decades. It helps remind people why they don't torture and that ultimately is the best lesson.

After all most of our founding fathers greatest ideas were born out of the oppressive policies they had fled from in Europe. What that tells us is that humans tend to learn the most from the worst things aka we learn best from negative bot positive stimulus. While it doesn't make a lot of moral sense, torturing people ultimately has the effect of reasserting why we don't torture people. The social backlash teaches us better than just learning history. Bush and the GOP had inadvertently created an entire generation of liberals by alienating any sane minded Americans. More teenagers for instance are following politics and most hate Bush. They may not like the democrats, but what sticks more is they hate Bush and forever link him to the GOP.

It's sad we cannot learn once from the past and forever follow those lessons, but over time all things get skewed a bit. If torture actually worked in fact, we would probably still use it. Thankfully torture is not an effective information gathering process rather making friends gets you intel. The fact we tortured people makes the chance of informants much lower and the area much more hostile for field surveillance.  

In the 60s polls showed American's were willing to give up privacy rights in order to be protected from the USSR and it's evil red anvil and hammer wielding commies. So a supposed majority of Americans were willing to be spied on somewhat in order to fight the red threat.


So the phenomenon of forgetting the fundamental reasons we have rights is common. 

We used torture for decades just do a search on US war crimes. We tortured in Korea, Vietnam, ww2, ww1, the civil war and we've committed every other type of war crime throughout our history. 

Perhaps the real shame is we are pretending to be surprised when in reality we have a long history of war crimes. This also goes hand in hand with the public's inability to understand that aggressive foreign policies, such as overthrowing government is the fuel force behind terrorism. To this day most Americans cannot admit that we've had this coming for decades and terrorism such as 911 is just sheer revenge. In most cases these attacks should be called guerrilla ware fare, not terrorism. Terrorism is where you target the public and attack their way of life. Bin Laden targeted government and financial institutions.

The people who released the anthrax are terrorists. Bin Laden is at war with the US using modernized urban guerrilla warfare tactics. If he had a missile instead of a plane I'm sure he would have happily used that, but steal a plane was simply far more practical and trying to steal a cruise missile. I call that an act of warfare, not terrorism. 

What we did in Abu Garb on the other hand was terrorism because we attack their core fundamental principles even though they may have been rebels snatching people off the streets and raping them is in fact terrorism.

Flying a plane into a financial hub or the pentagon is not terrorism, it's an act of war. Our reaction to this rather small attack has been one of the most embarrassingly blow out of proportion threats in history. This and the cold war will look like victories to many, but they are examples of the public being manipulated in order to archive political goals which just so happen to appear to motivated primarily by wealth.

After WW1 when EE Jews migrated to Germany the local German Jewry was very condescending to say the least - they regarded them as inferiors and ""eastern barbarians"" and ""Slavs"".

My point is that all the Jewish scientists intellectuals who came from Eastern Europe but which had ""german sounding names"" are really Slavic Jews who were natives in the land for a long time - they did not come there in some huge migration. Their family names were germanised as a product of Austro-Hungarian rule and Bureaucracy - they werent really under the influence of a Germanic culture.

The reason why German Jews were more successful than EE Jews (those with Slavic names and Germanised names alike) is:
1. The german culture was just more advanced and progressive (as you stated) 
2. The emancipation process started in EE in full force only in the beginning of the 20'th century. In Germany it started hundreds of years earlier. Germany was much more liberal than the countries in Eastern Europe.

So when you hear about scientists like Landau who have a German surname but are actually from Russia then we are talking about EE Jews with Germanized surnames who enjoyed the late emancipation process in Eastern Europe.

False,2,0,,"Ok, I'm as anti-BNP as they come but I'll play devil's advocate and explain what pros non-tradition supporters might see, because they are trying to make the party look more respectable - it is just that once you peel the mask away, they are always just as bad as ever.

First of all, if you're not British, you might not realise that our elected representatives work on different levels.  We have local government made up of councilors, a UK government made up of Members of Parliament or MPs (with a house of Lords which review and bat acts back) and MEPs who are representatives in the European Parliament.

The BNP tries to place different emphasis depending whether it is a local government election or a European election where they won 2 seats last night.  They currently have no UK MPs.

**PROs**
•  Immigration.  You don't have to be racist to know there is a problem in Britain's immigration.  Even the government says they don't have accurate figures for it.  Britain does have a developed welfare system.  It is easy to see how people might be attracted if they don't research the party properly.

•Anti-positive discrimination. Again that sounds like a good thing.  The leader of the BNP talks about having to respect other cultures yet 'our' own culture is brushed over so as to not cause offense.  However the BNP is only against positive-discrimination to replace it with negative-discrimination.

•Anti-corruption.  With the MPs expense scandal the BNP tried to capitalise (they wouldn't be involved in it because they didn't have any MPs)...they tried to portray themselves as an alternative to the mainstream parties.

•Anti-EU.  As much as 85% of the laws in the UK are made through the EU and despite numerous pledges to have a referendum on it the British people never have.  In fact if you look at the results from last night the two leading parties were EU skeptics,  pro-referendum and anti EU.  BNP launched itself as another staunch EU  opponent.

•On the local government front they campaign on small, to almost trivial matters when trying to get a councilor.  Anything from litter, to stopping speeding near a local school.  Several small local projects and pet grievances that win votes one street at a time.

**CONS**

Where to start?  They're racist for a start - if you're black you can't be a member of the BNP.

•They advocate segregating communities into colour [AND BUILDING SEGREGATION WALLS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCt5Ce0i-m4).  When asked on Newsnight, a politics program in the UK, the leader of the BNP replied that a Polish immigrant should be allowed to live 'on the white side' of the wall.  Anybody with any grain of political acumen realises that this won't make things any better - hell it'd create a race war.  Apartheid does that.

•They'd destroy the NHS.  They advocate paying for legal Black and Asian people to leave the country and as segregation walls and forced movement kicks in you can see how they might want to.  But if you look at how many Asian and foreign doctors and nurses work in the NHS, and the greater economy too, filling gaps to make sure the commitment to service is met you quickly realise that it would cease to function.  Britain works because the brightest and the smartest want to come and work in it and they know that its liberal values will afford them equality.  The BNP wants to kick the brain-drain into reverse.

•The candidates.  It would be quite easy to attack the BNP just on their racism, fascism, anti-homosexuality, anti-islam, anti-left platform.  But in reality they have a huge problem with their own candidates and trying to make themselves look respectable.  They have close links with violence and other white-supremacist groups like combat 18 and the KKK.  Many of the people who join the BNP are found to have a violent background with criminal convictions.  The leader his self, Nick Griffin, was convicted for inciting racial hatred in 1998 and given a suspended jail sentence, which has never been over turned.  [It was over his part in producing an anti-semitic magazine called 'The Rune' which idolised the Nazis.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/programmes/2001/bnp_special/membership/organisers/paul_ballard.stm)  - so not only do they find it hard to attract candidates which have not got convictions which should really rule them out from a rational person voting for them - the ones that they do have just aren't of a caliber.  They are, as a rule, found uniformed and political novices. It'd be like going to the Politician store and saying, ""I'll have the inept one please.""  Take for example - they want to put a gun in every home.  Now you may be an American raised in a healthy gun culture knowing a respect and how to use a gun.  Britain doesn't have that.  It'd be like dropping the drinking age limit down to 18 in America and the age of consent down to 16.  The police would have a meltdown.  Well imagine putting millions of guns onto the streets at a time when the Welfare system is collapsing because they've killed the NHS and the economy and when racial tension is at feverpitch because of the segregation walls they'd build.

One of the BIG CONS for the BNP has to be, they wouldn't have a clue what they're doing.  
It'd be like locking children in a sweetie shop overnight.

•They're incredibly authoritarian and they'd roll back centuries of liberal reform.

If we eliminate humans the problem will just grow back. Climate change will do the work for us and likely limit global food output, thus limiting humans. Periods of climate change also increase the change of pandemics. 

It's possible we see something like the little ice age happen, while most people predict drought in many ways a period of lower than average temps is more likely the result of our tampering with the ecosystem. Ocean currents need temperature differences and as the planet warms the temp radicals decline and heat distribution throughout the planet is slowed.

In other words as the ice caps melt the ocean currents will slow and heat distribution will slow with it. Most geographies will experience this in the form of temp reduction since many areas rely, such as much of Europe rely on warm currents to keep their otherwise cold continent running.

North and South America will be the places to live, asia will be unstable. China will flood very badly and then starve. Deserts may become even drier without the help of ocean currents.

See, you have to differentiate between parties and countries. For instance:

The point is that the SPD is not left. It is right-of-center, as defined by CDU/CSU/SPD.

The reason SPD has done so badly is because it has abandoned its voter platform. I would expect that CSU will eventually disappear, losing voters to CDU and far-right parties as will SPD, losing voters to CDU and the New Left.

I cannot comment on the other EU countries, of course. A lot of the far-right voting is due to the low support EU in general has. I can't blame them, I would have voted for an EU-critical party myself, had I found one which wasn't nazi.

According to the Pirate Party website, you should see the conviction as something positive since you are against commercial pirate copying. The only way you could look at the conviction in a negative light is if you think different rules should be applicable for record companies and pirates or that you want to remove conspiracy charges from Swedish criminal law but I can't find any of those points in your party program.

**Christian Engström:** We view the conviction very negatively. Even if you disregard that the lead police officer was bribed by Warner Brothers and that the judge was professionally biased, the conviction was still wrong. File sharing is always non-commercial. It's about two citizens that chooses to share a file between each other, without anyone getting or requiring payment for it. What the Pirate Bay does is making available a search service that makes it easier for file sharers to find each other. Even if the Pirate Bat was as commercial as eg Google, it still shouldn't be illegal according to the legislation that the Pirate Party suggests. To make available a tool that helps people do a legal activity should always be legal, even if it may be so that the tools are made available on a commercial basis.

**Katja:** Hi! If criminals and terrorists gets new digital tools, shouldn't police and intelligence agencies also get to do that? No suspicion of a crime is needed for the police to be allowed to patrol the roads.

**Christian Engström:** We have nothing against police surveillance of criminals when there are concrete evidence for a suspected crime and it has been ordered by a court according to rättegångsbalken (ed: Swedish criminal law). But there is a huge difference between implementing new systems that casually monitors the entire population just for the happenstance that the state should be interested in something on a future date. That is in violation with article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, that is part of the Swedish constitution. If the government wants to rescind the constitution, at least it has to declare a state of emergency first, but I can't see what could motivate such an act at the moment. Thus I can not accept mass monitoring in the way that for instance the FRA-law and the data retention act would.

**oscar**: isn't it a bit non-serious to call your self a pirate party?

**Christian Engström:** The name is our greatest asset, without we would never have been at the point we are today. I agree in part that it is to some disadvantage exactly at this time in the election process, since it very slightly elevates the threshold for us to be regarded seriously. But as soon as we have gotten into parliament it becomes a great asset again. The great interest from international media is partly depending on that we have a name that sets us apart and signals something different. I feel proud to be able to say that I am a pirate.

**Fref:** Does the Pirate Party have any opinion on the climate issue?

**Christian Engström:** No, but we are convinced that a more open and transparent EU should be of great help on many environmental issues. The legislation there is often similar to that on net-political issues: on one side well paid lobbyists that represent the big corporations interests and on the other side capable and well read activists that stand for the interest of the common. A more equal playing field down in Brussels should be very positive, both for the environmental issue and many other issues.

*Fredrik:* You want your party to premierly be perceived as a party that is just for free filesharing. But the consequences of your politics still becomes that. How do you think that the culture creators should get paied for their works? Through taxor through fee such as STIM? All artists doesn't make enough to get by on concerts and gigs ?

**Christian Engström:** Artists can continue to make money the same way as today. We have at least 10 years of experience on how massive filesharing affects society (Napster started in 1999). If you look at the statistics, you'll see that the revenue for the the cultural sector has been constant during that period, or even increased somewhat in step with a wealthier society. There have been some changes in the cultural sector, especially regarding music. Record sales have almost halved, but that has led to that those that like misc has gotten money left over to spend on concerts instead, so concert revenues have exploded. This is a huge gain for artists since a typical record deal gives 5-7% to the artist, while at gigs they typically get 50%. Thanks to filesharing, artists actually gets more money and less to the record executives. We think that is an excellent development that there is a very good reason to be pleased about. Some planned economic system to benefit the bureaucrats working at STIM is there no need for.

**Peter Törnblom:** Al-Qaida defeated USA, Bush dismantled constitutional rights that are basic for a free state and democracy. With the Patriot act, the American citizens were deprived of their civil rights, government agencies are allowed to read email, bug the internet and cellphones, read all types of registers and databases such as medical journals, insurances, libraries, membership ledgers, they are allowed to enter residences to ""secure evidence"", all this without court order. Thus everyone becomes potential criminals that can be mapped and registered by the state. This disease is now spreading to Europe, many laws in the same general direction have been implemented in European states. How will the Pirate Party stop this from happening to European citizens?

**Christian Engström:** That is precisely why we exist and it is what we will work at in the European parliament. The civil rights, including the right to your privacy and having your electronic correspondence protected is the very foundation for the democratic society. It is not acceptable that the panic that spread after 9/11 breaks the fabric of society.

**Bob:** Down in Brussels, will you also work for more transparence in general and more measures against lobbyism?

**Christian Engström:** I believe we have very good chances of actually achieving something down there in Brussels. Not least because of the already great international interest for us. About half of the requests for interviews that I've received are from other European countries and half from Sweden. Politicians all over Europe have begun to become aware that net-politics is an important issue that they have so far neglected but that it's time to familiarize with now. Everyone also knows that the debate in Sweden is on the forefront globally, so there is a very large interest in what happens here now. It's the perfect starting position.

**P:** Considering that the Green Party fought the IPRED directive and software patents for years before the Pirate Party was conceived - are you really needed?

**Christian Engström:** The Green Party has a good attitude towards most of the Pirate Parties issues but the problem is that they have so many other issues that they are more passionate about than integrity, so in the end it gets compromised away. It is true that the Green Party has voted against a number of bad proposal, eg the harsher copyright law proposal of 2005, when it became illegal to download (and not just illegal to upload), or the FRA-law. But on the other hand it was MP that kept former minister of justice, Thomas Bodström, in power during the last Swedish parliament term. That is something that the Pirate Party would never have done, since we are never willing to compromise away the protection for citizens rights for any other  issue. That is why the Pirate Party is needed.

EU is way to complicated for any single individual to manage on his own but if you look at it as a giant online teamwork, then it's possible to affect the EU bureaucracy. That was the most important lesson that I got from being a net-activist against software patents during the a year in 2004/2005.

**datanissen:** What do you in the Pirate Party hope to achieve in regards to stopping corporations from seeking software patents?

**Christian Engström:** It was a great victory when the EU-parliament decided to reject the software patent directive in July 2005 but the European Patent Organization, EPO, sadly still grants them anyway, in direct violation of the European convention on patents and Swedish patent law. I think that in the longer term, the only way to secure Europe against software patents is to abolish the patent system in full but that is an enormous job and it isn't realistic to think that we can achieve that in one term of EU mandate. Meanwhile we got to make use of the opportunities that become available to in all ways possible work against software patents, which are very dangerous for the climate of innovation and growth in the IT-segment.

-

**Niklas:** How do you look at the risk that the Pirate Party will go the same way as Junilistan. That is, that you are forgotten after you have gotten into the European Parliament and will have lesser success in national elections?

**Christian Engström:** The only way to avoid that fate is to deliver results down there in Brussels but I think we have good chances of doing just that. Should it turn out that we failed, despite our good intentions, then we obviously don't deserve renewed mandate.

-

**Magnus:** The salaries in the EU-parliament were recently raised to 80 000 SEK and a 45 000 SEK blanket expense account. What do you think about that and are you willing to donate part of your salary to charity (for instance the EFF)? If you're willing to abstain salary, how much (for instance at level with your current salary or that of a member of Swedish parliament (55 000 SEK) and reject the rest)? And lastly, if you think it's good doing it that way, would you consider some general guidelines for all Pirate Party candidates?

**Christian Engström:** I agree that MEP salaries are overly high and I'm going to donate 10% of my salary to the pirate movement.

-

**Greger Ekström:** Hi Christian! I wonder what your opinion on filesharing is? And what is it that others think is wrong about it? I deify filesharing and do it every day, but my brother is against that which becomes a problem with the economy.

**Christian Ensgtröm:** Filesharing is something absolutely wonderful. Suddenly each and every one that has an internet connection has access to the worlds collected culture and knowledge a mere click away. The public libraries arrived in the 19th century, and they made it possible for common man to have access to books without having to pay anything. The authors back then shrieked loudly that no one would write any books in the future if this mooching wasn't stopped instantly, but the politicians of the day were smarter than that. They realized that the asset of free access to culture and knowledge was central for Sweden as a nation to grow an develop into the future, so they decided to allow it and even encourage the public libraries against the authors protests. Now internet is the most amazing public library ever created and it's just getting better and better. The only thing we need is politicians that are as willing to embrace the future as the politicians back in the 18-hundreds. Sadly it turns out that a new party was needed for it to happen in our day.

-

**Fille:** What do you think about the data retention act that minister of justice, Beatrice Ask, is currently working on?

**Christian Engström:** We are definitely opposed to the data retention act and will do anything in our power to stop it from becoming Swedish law.

-

**Oscar:** Good luck in EU, you already have my vote, my aunts' and my uncles'. I hope you find a political block that agrees to defend human rights and personal integrity, do you think you will succeed?

**Christian Engström:** Yes. Engaged citizens that cooperate online can achieve wonders. That's exactly what we're going to do.

-

**Alexander:** PP already has my vote in the EU-elections but if we wanted, what possibilities do we have in breaking international treaties, for instance regarding Patent rights? A treaty isn't eternal, so it most be possible to rescind, or what?

**Christian Engström:** In politics, the most important thing is that if there is a will, there is a way. Then it's always possible to find technical solutions to handle the international treaties. It's probably hard for Sweden to go on its separate way on patent legislation but Europe is big enough to do what it wants without risking international economical sanctions.

AKA the basic occupations of the time. The Ottomans fought the West over it in 1860 for a reason. It was growing and prospering in the 19th century so that by the time the 20th century came in, it was THE port between the Middle East and Europe. The rail line to Damascus solidified that.

It was also the intellectual capital of the Middle East due to its universities, missionary activity (all Western, its true), etc.

All this was part of central Beirut. Which became desolate after the 1975 war. Blame whoever on the war, because you're right, Lebanon became the pissing fight of the stronger, but before the 50's, Lebanon was a damn nice place to live.

&gt;In particular, a billion is 109 = 1 000 000 000 in the American system and 1012 = 1 000 000 000 000 in the European system. For 109, Europeans say ""thousand million"" or ""milliard.""
&gt;
&gt;Although we describe the two systems today as American or European, both systems are actually of French origin. The French physician and mathematician Nicolas Chuquet (1445-1488) apparently coined the words byllion and tryllion and used them to represent 1012 and 1018, respectively, thus establishing what we now think of as the ""European"" system. However, it was also French mathematicians of the 1600's who used billion and trillion for 109 and 1012, respectively. This usage became common in France and in America, while the original Chuquet nomenclature remained in use in Britain and Germany. The French decided in 1948 to revert to the Chuquet (""European"") system, leaving the U.S. as the chief standard bearer for what then became clearly an American system.
&gt;
&gt;In recent years, American usage has eroded the European system, particularly in Britain and to a lesser extent in other countries. This is primarily due to American finance, because Americans insist that $1 000 000 000 be called a billion dollars. In 1974, the government of Prime Minister Harold Wilson announced that henceforth ""billion"" would mean 109 and not 1012 in official British reports and statistics. The Times of London style guide now defines ""billion"" as ""one thousand million, not a million million.""
&gt;
&gt;The result of all this is widespread confusion. Anyone who uses the words ""billion"" and ""trillion"" internationally should make clear which meaning of those words is intended. On the Internet, some sites outside the U.S. use the compound designation ""milliard/billion"" to designate the number 1 000 000 000. In science, the names of large numbers are usually avoided completely by using the appropriate SI prefixes. Thus 109 watts is a gigawatt and 1012 joules is a terajoule. Such terms cannot be mistaken.
&gt;
&gt;There is no real hope of resolving the controversy in favor of either system. Americans are not likely to adopt the European nomenclature, and Europeans will always regard the American system as an imposition. However, it is possible to imagine a solution: junk both Latin-based systems and move to a Greek-based system in which, for n &gt; 3, the Greek number n is used to generate a name for 103n. (The traditional names thousand and million are retained for n = 1 and 2 and the special name gillion, suggested by the SI prefix giga-, is proposed for n = 3.)
&gt;
&gt;This process can be continued indefinitely, but one has to stop somewhere. The name centillion (n = 100) has appeared in many dictionaries. A centillion is 10303 (1 followed by 303 zeroes) in the American system and a whopping 10600 (1 followed by 600 zeroes) in the European system.
&gt;
&gt;Finally, there is the googol, the number 10100 (1 followed by 100 zeroes). Invented more for fun than for use, the googol lies outside the regular naming systems. The googol equals 10 duotrigintillion in the American system, 10 sexdecilliard in the European system, and 10 triacontatrillion in the proposed Greek-based system.
&gt;
&gt;The googolplex (1 followed by a googol of zeroes) is far larger than any of the numbers discussed here.
&gt;
&gt;The original definition of a googelplex is a 1, followed by the number of zeros it took unitl the man's son's hand got tired.

False,11,0,,"I wrote a letter to the editor after reading this.  I encourage you to do the same.

To the Editor,

I'm tired of newspapers publishing articles written by so-called experts who offer no proof for the opinions they cling to with such authority.

Mr. Sabet writes,

""is that the likely increase in marijuana prevalence resulting from legalization would probably increase the already high costs of marijuana use in society. Accidents would increase, healthcare costs would rise and productivity would suffer.""

Taken point by point:

There is no evidence to show that legalization would lead to what many seem to believe is an epidemic of potheads clogging chip aisles of America.  In Portugal (the European country with the most liberal drug laws)  the rates of drug use fell significantly once they softened their drug laws (http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1893946,00.html).

As for Mr. Sabet's comment that accidents will increase, this too has no factual basis.  Dr. Jason White from the University of Adelaide conducted a study which actually showed that drivers who had smoked marijuana were, in fact, marginally less likely to be in an accident.

Mr Sabet's assertion that health care costs will rise is puzzling at best.  Considering there has never been a death associated with marijuana use, I'm curious as to the cause of these mysterious costs.

Last, but not least: the popular idea that marijuana use will destroy productivity.  The image of the slacker/stoner living in their parent's basement and contributing nothing to society is so thoroughly woven in to our popular culture, that we accept it as fact.  The truth is, that though this archetype makes for an amusing character in movies and TV, there is little basis in reality.  The idea that marijuana turns otherwise productive people into couch dwelling burdens on society is simply untrue.  Is someone with a propensity for laziness and a lack of ambition more likely to habitually smoke marijuana?  Without a doubt; but they're also more likely to abuse alcohol, eat unhealthy food, and skip their six month checkups at the dentist.

Until those opposed to legalization start researching their claims instead of trotting out factually inaccurate cliches from the Regan era ""War on Drugs"", there will never be an intelligent debate on this issue.",True,1425982200,,False,t3_8qq1n,mobius88,11,t3_8qq1n,t5_2cneq,,politics,1244481323,0,0,t1_c0a5013,c0a5013

Strangely, she was awarded about $2000 for ""victimization"" -- victimization apparently has to do with the procedure or process with which her case was handled.  Among other things public officials, including the Prime Minister, made statements regarding the merits of the case while was pending before the judge or tribunal but before a decision was entered.

Another weird thing, which I know is common in Europe regarding civil rights cases, it is that she is going to appeal not only in the UK, but also to a court of review of the European Union. 

Finally, another weird part of the article in the English paper, the Guardian, says:

""Her solicitor, Nick Whittingham, practice manager of Kirklees Law Centre, said the dismissal of the discrimination complaints was disappointing but it was significant that she had won on the handling of her case.

Kirklees welcomed the main verdicts last night as the right decision on a difficult balance between the 'rights of local children to the best quality education possible and Mrs Azmi's desire to express her cultural beliefs by wearing a veil in class'.""

So her solicitor, her lawyer, is naturally disappointed in the decision because she lost on the main complaints, employment discrimination.  However the law firm for whom the lawyer is presumably employed, Kirklees, believes that the right decision was reached on a difficult balance blah blah blah.  Any Brits out there who can explain what I am obviously missing?

What justifies this blanket statement?  He hasn't identify any reason at all that ""drugs are bad"".  If he did, he would have to address each popular drug one by one, as they all have different effects on the body, mind, and on society.  

&gt;As far as integrating these users into society and avoiding the stigma associated with being a drug addict, I say bring it on. The stigma is what kept me being an experimenter and not a full fledged addict, to drugs anyway. As I said, in my own post, the stigma and the fear of a life destroyed is a huge deterrent and the drug war should continue on.

All drug users are not drug addicts.  If there's a stigma about being an adict it will continue even if the item is legalized.  Everyone likes a beer, but no one wants to be an alchohalic.  If people don't want their lives destroyed by drugs, they should use them responsibly, or not at all.  But if the stigma is a such a powerful deterent (which I think it may be), why use our resources on law enforcement as an additional deterent?  We already have stigma.

&gt;I have never been there but I hear places like Amsterdam and San Francisco with their clean needles for all, are not places you would necessarily feel the safest in and most certainly would not want to bring your kids to.

I've traveled pretty extensively in Europe, and as far as big cities go, I've never felt safer in a European city than I did in Amsterdam.  That includes London, where I actually lived for four years.  I felt more safe as a tourist in Amsterdam than as a resident of London, and it wasn't close.

False,3,0,,"The argument for Laver is his two Grand Slams.  I think Donald Budge is the only other guy to win the Grand Slam (you could say he invented the term, borrowed from golf).

There are a few arguments you could make against Laver.  Until 1968, the Grand Slams were not open.  That is, only amateurs could play.  Although pros made nowhere near as much money as they do now, they still made money.  Most pros went on these barnstorming tours, a bit like today's exhibitions and played matches all over.  If you wanted to make a living playing tennis, you need to go pro.

This limited the number of Grand Slams Laver played.  Having said that, if pros were allowed in 1962, Laver probably wouldn't have won a Grand Slam.  Laver struggled against the professionals when he first turned pro.

The other key was the Australian Open.  Until air travel became cheaper, getting to Australia to play was a bit of a pain.  This affected players from, say, the Tilden era.  It was even a pain to play in France or for Europeans to play in the US.

This is why a player like Margaret Court won so many Australian Opens.  Few people were making the trip to challenge her, and she had no competition (plus she was a very good player).

The other knock is grass.  At the time, only the French was played on clay.  Wimbledon, the US Open, and the Australian were all played on grass.

The US Open moved to clay briefly in 1975-1977.  In 1978, they moved to Flushing Meadows and played on the hard courts for the first time.

Sometime in the 80s, Australia moved to hard courts as well.  Ideally, Australia should have moved indoors to create four different surfaces.  They were the first to build a retractable roof, however.  Wimbledon, this year, is the second.

Quick and dirty version:
Madison, the father of the constitution, wrote that his constitution was designed to take power away from the ordinary people in order to protect the rich. He said he would do this by enlarging the political districts. He said that enlarging the districts would increase the number of factions in each distict, which would, he said, make it harder for the people to unite and discover their common interest. That lack of unity would leave the rich alone to do as they pleased with the govt.

What is an enlarged political district? The office of the president has a district comprised of the entire nation. That is a very large political district. The US senator also has a large district (an entire state). 

Representatives have smaller districts, therefore the people are more in control of their reps because they can more easily unite and discover their common interest because the district is smaller.

W european nations have govts where the real power is int he parliament, where the polticians are elected from small districts. The rich do not control the govts there as much as they do here.

False,1,0,,"Great link - and here's the Senior Counsel to the USS Liberty Court of Inquiry:

Declaration of Ward Boston, Jr.,Captain, JAGC, USN (Ret.)
Counsel to the U.S. Navy Court of Inquiry's investigation into the Israeli attack on the USS Liberty

I, Ward Boston, Jr. do declare that the following statement is true and complete:

For more than 30 years, I have remained silent on the topic of USS Liberty. I am a military man and when orders come in from the Secretary of Defense and President of the United States, I follow them.

However, recent attempts to rewrite history compel me to share the truth.

In June of 1967, while serving as a Captain in the Judge Advocate General Corps, Department of the Navy, I was assigned as senior legal counsel for the Navy's Court of Inquiry into the brutal attack on USS Liberty, which had occurred on June 8th.

The late Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, president of the Court, and I were given only one week to gather evidence for the Navy's official investigation into the attack, despite the fact that we both had estimated that a proper Court of Inquiry into an attack of this magnitude would take at least six months to conduct.

Admiral John S. McCain, Jr., then Commander-in-chief, Naval Forces Europe (CINCUSNAVEUR), at his headquarters in London, had charged Admiral Kidd (in a letter dated June 10, 1967) to ""inquire into all the pertinent facts and circumstances leading to and connected with the armed attack; damage resulting therefrom; and deaths of and injuries to Naval personnel.""

Despite the short amount of time we were given, we gathered a vast amount of evidence, including hours of heartbreaking testimony from the young survivors.

The evidence was clear. Both Admiral Kidd and I believed with certainty that this attack, which killed 34 American sailors and injured 172 others, was a deliberate effort to sink an American ship and murder its entire crew. Each evening, after hearing testimony all day, we often spoke our private thoughts concerning what we had seen and heard. I recall Admiral Kidd repeatedly referring to the Israeli forces responsible for the attack as ""murderous bastards."" It was our shared belief, based on the documentary evidence and testimony we received first hand, that the Israeli attack was planned and deliberate, and could not possibly have been an accident.

I am certain that the Israeli pilots that undertook the attack, as well as their superiors, who had ordered the attack, were well aware that the ship was American.

I saw the flag, which had visibly identified the ship as American, riddled with bullet holes, and heard testimony that made it clear that the Israelis intended there be no survivors. 10. Not only did the Israelis attack the ship with napalm, gunfire, and missiles, Israeli torpedo boats machine-gunned three lifeboats that had been launched in an attempt by the crew to save the most seriously wounded -- a war crime.

Admiral Kidd and I both felt it necessary to travel to Israel to interview the Israelis who took part in the attack. Admiral Kidd telephoned Admiral McCain to discuss making arrangements. Admiral Kidd later told me that Admiral McCain was adamant that we were not to travel to Israel or contact the Israelis concerning this matter.

Regrettably, we did not receive into evidence and the Court did not consider any of the more than sixty witness declarations from men who had been hospitalized and were unable to testify in person.

I am outraged at the efforts of the apologists for Israel in this country to claim that this attack was a case of ""mistaken identity.""

In particular, the recent publication of Jay Cristol's book, The Liberty Incident, twists the facts and misrepresents the views of those of us who investigated the attack.

It is Cristol's insidious attempt to whitewash the facts that has pushed me to speak out.

I know from personal conversations I had with Admiral Kidd that President Lyndon Johnson and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara ordered him to conclude that the attack was a case of ""mistaken identity"" despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

Admiral Kidd told me, after returning from Washington, D.C. that he had been ordered to sit down with two civilians from either the White House or the Defense Department, and rewrite portions of the court's findings.

Admiral Kidd also told me that he had been ordered to ""put the lid"" on everything having to do with the attack on USS Liberty. We were never to speak of it and we were to caution everyone else involved that they could never speak of it again.

I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of that statement as I know that the Court of Inquiry transcript that has been released to the public is not the same one that I certified and sent off to Washington.

I know this because it was necessary, due to the exigencies of time, to hand correct and initial a substantial number of pages. I have examined the released version of the transcript and I did not see any pages that bore my hand corrections and initials. Also, the original did not have any deliberately blank pages, as the released version does. Finally, the testimony of Lt. Painter concerning the deliberate machine gunning of the life rafts by the Israeli torpedo boat crews, which I distinctly recall being given at the Court of Inquiry and included in the original transcript, is now missing and has been excised.

Following the conclusion of the Court of Inquiry, Admiral Kidd and I remained in contact. Though we never spoke of the attack in public, we did discuss it between ourselves, on occasion. Every time we discussed the attack, Admiral Kidd was adamant that it was a deliberate, planned attack on an American ship.

In 1990, I received a telephone call from Jay Cristol, who wanted to interview me concerning the functioning of the Court of Inquiry. I told him that I would not speak to him on that subject and prepared to hang up the telephone. Cristol then began asking me about my personal background and other, non-Court of Inquiry related matters. I endeavored to answer these questions and politely extricate myself from the conversation. Cristol continued to return to the subject of the Court of Inquiry, which I refused to discuss with him. Finally, I suggested that he contact Admiral Kidd and ask him about the Court of Inquiry.

At no time did I ever hear Admiral Kidd speak of Cristol other than in highly disparaging terms. I find Cristol's claims of a ""close friendship"" with Admiral Kidd to be utterly incredible. I also find it impossible to believe the statements he attributes to Admiral Kidd, concerning the attack on USS Liberty.

Several years later, I received a letter from Cristol that contained what he purported to be his notes of our prior conversation. These ""notes"" were grossly incorrect and bore no resemblance in reality to that discussion. I find it hard to believe that these ""notes"" were the product of a mistake, rather than an attempt to deceive. I informed Cristol that I disagreed with his recollection of our conversation and that he was wrong. Cristol made several attempts to arrange for the two of us to meet in person and talk but I always found ways to avoid doing this. I did not wish to meet with Cristol as we had nothing in common and I did not trust him.

Contrary to the misinformation presented by Cristol and others, it is important for the American people to know that it is clear that Israel is responsible for deliberately attacking an American ship and murdering American sailors, whose bereaved shipmates have lived with this egregious conclusion for many years.

I'm not saying anything about future warming. I'm quoting your sources (WRT past warming) back to you. Sources you either do not understand or do not read.

From your [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change):

&gt;&gt;European Academy of Sciences and Arts  In 2007, the European Academy of Sciences and Arts issued a formal declaration on climate change titled Let's Be Honest:
Human activity is most likely responsible for climate warming. **Most of the climatic warming over the last 50 years** is likely to have been caused by increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

Based on [CRU](http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/info/warming/), we had about 0.4-0.5°C warming in the last 50 years. Most of that, by definition, cannot exceed ALL of that. Most would be about 0.2 to 0.4°C. That is what all those academies say. Not me.

Again, you expose your ignorance by lacking knowledge or the ability to understand anything, not even the things you yourself say.

What I said:

&gt;I have yet to see any evidence that models of future climate are more accurate than monkeys throwing darts at a wall.

What you thought I said:

&gt;(I) believ(ing) that the evidence for global warming hinges on 'models'.

The two concepts are so far removed from each other I am starting to wonder if you are using an interpreter to translate (poorly) my comments into your own language.

&gt;And how are you qualified to reach a different conclusion to the one drawn by every national science academy of every major industrialised country on the planet?

3) Government owned GM/Chrysler will be able to function as an independent entity, responding quickly and appropriately to consumer demands and market pressures.

The best argument against prohibition of any kind is that you own yourself.  No one else should have any say in what you put in your body.  Your body is yours to do as you wish, as long as you are not hurting anyone else.  An adult consuming plant matter or chemical compounds in the privacy of their own homes is nobody's business.   If there is no victim, there is no crime.  Right now, if you get busted on a possession charge, the criminal complaint will say something like Your State versus Joe Toker, as if you've damaged the states property (YOU!) by taking unauthorized substances.  We are not property! That's why, even though marijuana may have medical properties, that shouldn't be the main argument for making it legal.

&gt;&gt;”My interest in keeping the war on drugs going is not for any moral reason as you stated in your post. It is just common sense.”

Actually, what you are saying is not common sense, besides that, we all have learned in this class that the “common sense” argument hasn’t got a leg to stand on.  The war on drugs has killed more people then marijuana has. The reason marijuana is illegal is not because it's ""bad"" like all ""drugs"", (why aren't we in a rush to make caffeine illegal?) but actually because of a smear campaign started by DuPont that capitalized on fear, racism and the ignorance of American legislators in order to protect investments from a competing product (hemp).  There was no scientific process involved.

All the reasons marijuana may get you into any kind of trouble is the fact that it is illegal, and that is the root cause of 99% (I can’t link to proof of this percentage and I know that this is most likely off but I put it here anyway because I do remember reading it before and believing the source) of the problems that marijuana puts on people (the other 1% would be laziness, but that’s more a personality trait than the plants effect)

&gt;&gt;”Drugs are bad, including marijuana.”  I didn’t include the munchies comment because I assumed that wasn’t a real issue you had with the topic but only a light interjection

According to the prestigious European medical journal, The Lancet(http://norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=3476), ""The smoking of cannabis, even long-term, is not harmful to health. ... It would be reasonable to judge cannabis as less of a threat ... than alcohol or tobacco.""

On 23 May 2006, Donald Tashkin, M.D., Professor of Medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA in Los Angeles announced that the use of cannabis does not appear to increase the risk of developing lung cancer, or increase the risk of head and neck cancers, such as cancer of the tongue, mouth, throat, or esophagus.

An extensive study published in 2006 by Donald Tashkin of the University of California, Los Angeles found that there is no significant link between smoking cannabis and lung cancer.  The study, which involved a large population sample (1,200 people with lung, neck, or head cancer, and a matching group of 1,040 without cancer) found no correlation between marijuana smoking and increased lung cancer risk.

Both of those studies provide scientific evidence that there isn’t a correlation between smoking cannabis and increased risk of cancer.  I know an easy point to argue against this is there are studies that found no correlation between tobacco and cancer which I will then point out that there are many safer alternatives to smoke inhalation.

Besides the understanding by many people that drugs are not bad, you feel it's best to leave them in the hands of pushers to decide who 'needs' it, who's 'old enough' to buy it, or who's 'responsible' enough to not abuse it?  I can tell you from personal knowledge that anyone who has the money for it, qualifies.  4 years old?  400 years old?  If you got the cash, any pusher will gladly sell to you.  Prohibition keeps the decision of who should be getting it in the hands of the pushers.

&gt;&gt;”As far as integrating these users into society and avoiding the stigma associated with being a drug addict, I say bring it on. The stigma is what kept me being an experimenter and not a full fledged addict, to drugs anyway. As I said, in my own post, the stigma and the fear of a life destroyed is a huge deterrent and the drug war should continue on.”

Drug users are already integrated into our society, while avoiding the stigma associated with being a drug addict.  The only ones that fall under the stigma of drug addict are the same people that fall under the stigma of alcoholic.  Think of how many people you know that drink alcohol. Any amount of alcohol. Now think of how many of those qualify as an alcoholic. It’s not very many, is it?   Now think of how many drug addicts you see on TV, in the news, in the papers, and realize that the number of 'drug addicts' compared to 'drug users', is much smaller than the number of 'alcoholics' compared to the number of 'alcohol drinkers' there are.   What this means is, if you have a look around your office, your jaw would drop if you knew of even half of the number of drug users you're looking at.

All drug users are not drug addicts. If there's a stigma about being an addict it will continue even if the item is legalized. Everyone likes a beer, but no one wants to be an alcoholics. If people don't want their lives destroyed by drugs, they should use them responsibly, or not at all. But if the stigma is such a powerful deterrent (which I think it may be), why use our resources on law enforcement as an additional deterrent? We already have stigma.  The billions of tax dollars used on the war on drugs could be allocated to help people with drug problems instead of throwing them in jail.

&gt;&gt;”I have never been there but I hear places like Amsterdam and San Francisco with their clean needles for all, are not places you would necessarily feel the safest in and most certainly would not want to bring your kids to.”

First clean needles help prevent the spread of HIV, HIV is bad. Heroin addicts are still going to shoot up regardless of the legality of their drug, so we should keep clean needles depositories.

Second, I have never been there, but I hear the moon is made of cheese.

My friends felt safer as a tourist in Amsterdam than as a resident of London and DC.  They say the comparison isn't close.  Check out some crime rate reports on major European cities before even allowing this to come into the argument.

&gt;&gt;”Bottom line, happy, motivated people, wanting a fulfilling life do not do drugs.”

So you're saying all pot smokers are depressed, not motivated,  and do not want a fulfilling life?

Thomas Jefferson smoked marijuana, but I guess he didn't do anything important did he?  Here is a short list of other people that may or may not have been productive in their lives according to you:  Norman Mailer, Linda McCartney, Sir Paul McCartney, Jennifer Aniston, Michael Bloomberg, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Barack Obama, Robert Mitchum, Bill Murray, Francis Ford Coppola, Bob Denver, John Denver, Michael Phelps, Richard Feynman, Carl Sagan, Harrison Ford, Oliver Stone, Woody Harrelson, Ted Turner, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Sir Mick Jagger, and John F Kennedy.  Really?   ALL these people are unhappy, unmotivated and don't want a fulfilling life?

&gt;&gt;”Let's not start a new campaign like the work/family issue where people try to say you can have it all. Not possible when drugs are involved, even marijuana.”

Happy, motivated people, wanting a fulfilling life do often do tons of drugs.  There are millions of happy, successful people in America who are on anti-depressants, painkillers, sleep aids, digestion aids, sexual enhancers, etc... We ALL do drugs.  The argument is not about drugs, it's about law enforcement of marijuana.  Stop using this blanket argument because it doesn't make any sense.

False,1,0,,"&gt;OK but replace ""starting and losing a war"" with ""occupying our lands"" and that's the Palestinians' response. The country that they think Israel is trying to destroy is Palestine. I'm not saying I agree with them, or with you, but that seems to make it a shaky point.

Well here's the thing.  Any Jew who considers Israel oppressed is, IMNSHO, retarded.  And I personally think that the pity-party non-Israeli Jews are always trying to throw for the country goes too far anyway.  We should just up and say, we're a sovereign country now and we've got a right to defend our sovereignty.  Acting like we're cosmic victims when in fact we've managed to overcome that status is stupid.

&gt;I think I understand what you're saying here, but you were initially referring to the rush of Palestinians in 1948. At that time, Israel wasn't as developed, and as far as I understand it, wasn't a country really worth fighting over (from an economic standpoint). Unless the dictators of the surrounding countries had remarkable foresight, it seems unlikely that they would have planned to neglect the Palestinians in order to use them as a political weapon and rallying point for fanatics in the future. It seems more likely that these countries neglected the Palestinians because they couldn't deal with the sudden influx of people, and set up disgusting refugee camps where people starved and lived like dogs.

7 of the first, 5 of the second.  The Arab leaders didn't have foresight, what they had was ideology: pan-Arabism.  The idea among them back then was to create a single gigantic Arab state that would span the entire ""Arab Middle East"" from Iraq through Arabia into the Levant and Egypt.  Israel's existence scuppered that, and so the Arab leaders made the Palestinian Arabs into a refugee/fanatic population and a rallying point for the sake of the ideology they held at that time and to keep their own populations from revolting at how little their governments do for them.

After all, back then the Arab countries were no more developed than Israel.  What more would they have needed to do to give the Palestinian Arabs citizenship than print papers?

Finally, a component of prejudice came into it.  Among all Arabs, Palestinians are considered the lowest *by other Arabs*.  Palestinians are to the Arab Mideast what Jews were to Europe: a hated population that best be kept somewhere far away in their homeland where they can bother someone else even while ""we"" cheer them on and supply them with weapons from a distance.

&gt;Yes, but the alternative is to oppress the Gazans until some internal change makes them stop. As a casual observer it seems obvious that no internal political change can come about because the people are essentially living in a war zone. In a war zone, thugs will always rise to positions of leadership. Thugs will always breed other thugs, and fractious factions will fight for power, propagating the cycle and mentality of war. Furthermore, if you treat the Palestinians like your enemy, they will behave like your enemy, and will look to these thugs to fight for them, and represent them. It's also grossly inhumane to punish the entire population because rockets might fall. Would you close down mines because bullets are made of metal? Then why stop shipments of food because some boxes of food might be used to smuggle rockets?

As far as I know shipments of food get reduced in quality, not quantity.

To answer your larger questions, I understand the logic of the situation, but Israel's relationship with Gaza has become something like a no-win situation.  If Israel allows more into Gaza, rockets come.  If Israel allows less into Gaza, rockets come.  If Israel makes a ceasefire, rockets come.  If Israel goes to war against Hamas in Gaza, rockets come.

I also don't see what can be done for the Palestinian Arabs of Gaza.  Aid shipments are stolen by Hamas.  They can't have much of an economy because trade dies when transport in and out of the Strip gets constricted due to rocket smuggling, yet whenever Israel attempts to make this easier Hamas uses those crossings for smuggling and fires rockets into Israel.  If Israel or the UN actually went in and occupied the Strip to replace Hamas, the people would perceive this as oppression and rally to Hamas.  The only thing I can see that would help is an internal revolution in Gaza bringing to power a government that will genuinely abide by a ceasefire or peace agreement in order to improve the lives of the people there.

Keep in mind, the West Bank is different.  It's run by the PA, which makes honest attempts to collaborate with IDF for security purposes.  As a result, they have a more open economy (though still not as good as Israel's... more comparable to neighboring Jordan or Syria).

To make things worse, neither Hamas nor Fatah will agree to a peace settlement that ignores the Gaza Strip, so it's not like Israel can make peace in the West Bank as a model for the Gazans.  Furthermore, both Hamas and Fatah keep demanding a ""right of return"" for Palestinian ""refugees"" into Israel.  First of all, these refugees are the highly-multiplied descendants of the original Palestinians who fled areas taken by or allocated to Israel in 1948.  Second of all, the sheer number of them would overwhelm Israel's demographics and morph it into an Arab state.  This is the true goal of Hamas and Fatah in the peace process: to win a ""right of return"" and thereby ""liberate"" all of ""Palestine"" by guaranteeing themselves a Jew-free (until recently) State of Palestine with an Arab-majority *Dawlat Israil* (Arabic for ""State of Israel"").  Their leaders perceive this as a war of attrition in which they can eventually win enough pity from the world and have enough of a demographic advantage to overwhelm Israel in sheer numbers and support despite Israel's military advantage.

I'm not sure if they know or care that this approach is precisely what makes their economic situation so miserable.  If you ask a Palestinian or one of their Western supporters about it, I believe they call it ""democracy"".

I hope so, but there are always issues of area required given local insolation and net system efficiency.  From what I've seen, cheap thin-film style cells are unlikely to have efficiencies over 15-20%.  At 15% and 200w/sq.m average daily insolation, we need about 350 sq.m per person to satisfy the American energy usage of 250kwh per capita.  That's a lot of area.

Many wait in refugee camps in the West Bank, Gaza, and neighboring lands for a life of peace and security that they have never been able to lead.

The obligations -- the obligations that the parties have agreed to under the road map are clear.  For peace to come, it is time for them -- and all of us -- to live up to our responsibilities.

&gt; Palestinians must abandon violence.  Resistance through violence and killing is wrong and it does not succeed.  For centuries, black people in America suffered the lash of the whip as slaves and the humiliation of segregation.  But it was not violence that won full and equal rights.  It was a peaceful and determined insistence upon the ideals at the center of America's founding.  This same story can be told by people from South Africa to South Asia; from Eastern Europe to Indonesia.  It's a story with a simple truth:  that violence is a dead end.  It is a sign neither of courage nor power to shoot rockets at sleeping children, or to blow up old women on a bus.  That's not how moral authority is claimed; that's how it is surrendered.

&gt; Now is the time for Palestinians to focus on what they can build.  The Palestinian Authority must develop its capacity to govern, with institutions that serve the needs of its people. Hamas does have support among some Palestinians, but they also have to recognize they have responsibilities.  To play a role in fulfilling Palestinian aspirations, to unify the Palestinian people, Hamas must put an end to violence, recognize past agreements, recognize Israel's right to exist.

&gt; At the same time, Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel's right to exist cannot be denied, neither can Palestine's.  The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements.  (Applause.)  This construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace.  It is time for these settlements to stop.  (Applause.)

&gt; And Israel must also live up to its obligation to ensure that Palestinians can live and work and develop their society.  Just as it devastates Palestinian families, the continuing humanitarian crisis in Gaza does not serve Israel's security; neither does the continuing lack of opportunity in the West Bank. Progress in the daily lives of the Palestinian people must be a critical part of a road to peace, and Israel must take concrete steps to enable such progress. 

&gt; And finally, the Arab states must recognize that the Arab Peace Initiative was an important beginning, but not the end of their responsibilities.  The Arab-Israeli conflict should no longer be used to distract the people of Arab nations from other problems.  Instead, it must be a cause for action to help the Palestinian people develop the institutions that will sustain their state, to recognize Israel's legitimacy, and to choose progress over a self-defeating focus on the past.

&gt; America will align our policies with those who pursue peace, and we will say in public what we say in private to Israelis and Palestinians and Arabs.  (Applause.)  We cannot impose peace.  But privately, many Muslims recognize that Israel will not go away.  Likewise, many Israelis recognize the need for a Palestinian state.  It is time for us to act on what everyone knows to be true.

&gt; Too many tears have been shed.  Too much blood has been shed.  All of us have a responsibility to work for the day when the mothers of Israelis and Palestinians can see their children grow up without fear; when the Holy Land of the three great faiths is the place of peace that God intended it to be; when Jerusalem is a secure and lasting home for Jews and Christians and Muslims, and a place for all of the children of Abraham to mingle peacefully together as in the story of Isra -- (applause) -- as in the story of Isra, when Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed, peace be upon them, joined in prayer.  (Applause.)

&gt; The third source of tension is our shared interest in the rights and responsibilities of nations on nuclear weapons.

&gt; This issue has been a source of tension between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran.  For many years, Iran has defined itself in part by its opposition to my country, and there is in fact a tumultuous history between us.  In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government.  Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians.  This history is well known.  Rather than remain trapped in the past, I've made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward.  The question now is not what Iran is against, but rather what future it wants to build.

&gt; I recognize it will be hard to overcome decades of mistrust, but we will proceed with courage, rectitude, and resolve.  There will be many issues to discuss between our two countries, and we are willing to move forward without preconditions on the basis of mutual respect.  But it is clear to all concerned that when it comes to nuclear weapons, we have reached a decisive point.

False,1,0,,"the biggest misconception i think about SMD vs proportional representation systems is that lack of third parties are a problem that can be fixed.  

Think of it this way.  Every democratically elected government needs a coalition to pass legislation.  

It is fairly obvious in parliamentary systems like in the EU because different parties make official coalitions.  It happens in the US too.  When a group becomes popular enough one of the parties will adopt enough of their platform to attract enough supporters and gain an edge.

These third parties or ""fringe groups"" do effectively change the political parties and thus the government when their demands are popular enough to swing the advantage to the side that embraces them.

The only real difference here is that one system forms coalitions before an election, and the other after.

So, go ahead and join the pirate party or just advocate for their ideals.  If enough people do, a major party will make concessions to attract your vote.  Or if neither party does then the losing one will naturally become a third party and another more inclusive one will take over.  Just don't mistake a lack of public interest in what a third party advocates for institutionalized marginalization.

It's not, really. The Arabic Wikipedia is in Classical Arabic, which is a literal language that hasn't changed much for 1400 years. The vernacular languages of the modern Arabic world are all quite different, and quite different to each other, too.

Think of it as if all of Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands and England still used some variant of 7th century German in all written discourse. Or if Latin was still prevalent as a literary language in southern Europe. (OK, maybe a little less extreme than that, but don't underestimate a bilingual brain..)

&gt; he was telling me that basically any Arabic speaker could understand any other Arabic speaker, and even speakers of Farsi and Urdu, with little to no effort or confusion.

This quite simply isn't true.

There are a lot of Arabic loans in Persian and Urdu (and Pashto and Turkish, for that matter), but it's superficial. There are no grammatical similarities and the base vocabulary is all different. Also, sometimes the loans don't mean the exact same as in Arabic. 

And the pronunciation's quite different. The changes are mostly systematic (Arabic [x] -&gt; Turkish [h], (one variant of) Arabic [d] -&gt; Persian [z], etc.), but there's just no way at all an Arabic speaker with little or no previous experience of Persian or Turkish would be able to understand more than maybe one or two words out of a sentence in those, and most certainly nothing of the grammar.",True,1425982547,,True,t3_8qxmr,[deleted],10,t1_c0a5owd,t5_2qhos,,linguistics,1244552025,0,0,t1_c0a5quc,c0a5quc

Ages ago. Are you prepared to discuss the impact of the Napoleonic wars in European history and the relevance it has to the security decisions of today?

&gt;The best answer I can muster for why the U.S. hasn't invaded Canada is because 1. We share so much culture that a U.S. controlled Canada would look a lot like a Canada controlled Canada, so it would be for naught. 2.

Your first point is equivalent to goodwill, sorry. The second point is the only one of value: you clearly are dominant already. 

The main reason to invade Canada is also the best reason not to: consider that Nazi Germany never invaded Sweden. That decision had very little goodwill in it. Sweden, and its resources, were more valuable as a trading partner than as occupied territory susceptible to bombing campaigns.
So the main reason to not invade Canada is that the US, through trade, already has very good access to the resources of Canada, probably significantly better than it would have the first 20 years or so after an invasion.

The same goes for Europe: trading for resources instead of trying to conquer them by war. Also, it took French penalization, German revanchism and a madman to start WWII, after which the horrors of war was beat into the bones of the people of Europe in fashion that Americans cannot fathom (just as we Europeans cannot understand ""9/11 changed everything"").

Clearly, Europe without the US military canopy would have been very different, but western Europe would in all likelihood not have waged another war (clearly depending on the stability of democracy). The Balkan war would have been another story, as well as a likely war between Greece and Turkey.

I was actually just citing that fact to steal your thunder so that you couldn't try to raise it as a relevant issue. The U.S. did in fact invade Canada once, so it's not impossible, but I don't think it would happen today for the reasons listed. If the U.S. shrank significantly in power and Canada gained power such that the two were relatively similar in their power levels, I do believe the chance for war would go up significantly. All studies of international relations support this. Read some Frank Wayman, some Mearsheimer and some Morgenthau and get back to me. 

&gt;Your first point is equivalent to goodwill, sorry.

Not in the least. Good will and cultural similarity are quite different. If Germany took over France things there would look radically different. If the U.S. ran Canada today things would still be very much the same (save for the health care issue).

&gt;The main reason to invade Canada is also the best reason not to: consider that Nazi Germany never invaded Sweden. That decision had very little goodwill in it. Sweden, and its resources, were more valuable as a trading partner than as occupied territory susceptible to bombing campaigns. 

Germany didn't attack Sweden because they bolstered their defenses rapidly when they saw Finland come under attack, nearly doubling the army overnight. Germany saw that invading Sweden would be more of a thorn if attacked rather than just controlled with the threat of violence and a blockade via Denmark and Norway. Sweden was basically a puppet state of Germany for the course of the war. Germany would have invaded Sweden if doing so would have invaded Sweden if the benefits outweighed the consequences, but for them it did not. The fact that you think the Swedes were ""more valuable"" when they were making the Germans pay for iron than if they were simply taken over by Germany to produce it at even less cost to the war effort, you're nuts. Thanks for trying though. 

&gt;The same goes for Europe: trading for resources instead of trying to conquer them by war. Also, it took French penalization, German revanchism and a madman to start WWII, after which the horrors of war was beat into the bones of the people of Europe in fashion that Americans cannot fathom (just as we Europeans cannot understand ""9/11 changed everything"").

The United States won the war, but again I appreciate your attempt at revisionism. The USA suffered more military deaths than any country save for the USSR in WW2. We fully understand the horrors of the second World War.

&gt;The United States won the war, but again I appreciate your attempt at revisionism. The USA suffered more military deaths than any country save for the USSR in WW2. We fully understand the horrors of the second World War.

The Brits (+ Commonwealth) stalled the Germans long enough for the USSR and US to win WWII. The US was the only major participant that didn't suffer major infrastructure damage or had its territory threatened, and was along with the Brits the only one that didn't have its civilians suffer tremendously. That left a lasting difference in the psyche of the American people in comparison to the European. Americans don't view wars as something necessarily bad, naively many Americans think that the US won the war and everything got better than it was before. A European typically believes that war makes everything worse than before (e.g. the Balkan war).

You and many American scholars are stuck in 19th century thinking a la Clausewitz - if one person can gain more power through war, extend his influence geographically, he should, and he can convince any number of people to die for that cause. Europeans do not buy into that anymore. In this aspect, much of the continent is becoming Swedish a country that lost a third of its land and people to a rebel government in Oslo without even fighting for it.

Also, the France/German rivalry became pointless after the war since ruling Europe was not ruling the world. Again, that is another aspect of the US/USSR triumph, that is close to your point, but not the same. The German beast? What cause would they rally around? ""Blame the Turks""? Sorry, I don't see it. The Germans got soundly defeated, didn't suffer as crippling war reparations as after WWI and then became richer than they ever had been before. 

In conclusion, I give you that the unification and pacification (more or less) of Western Europe cam as a bonus from benevolent post-war policies (Marshall aid) and the politics of the Cold War era (teaming of East and West instead of FFA competition). But to say that we still are largely dependent on American military presence to stay at peace is as silly as saying that the only thing that keeps the US from another civil war is a repressive federal government. Sixty years is a long time.

You're not being very coherent, nor factual. Korea and mainland China were never colonized (except by the Japanese and Han Chinese) and India was colonized for a relatively short period of time and quite frankly British rule did much to civilize the less palatable aspects of some of the cultures of that region (the Sati comes to mind) and to develop the country industrially. Atrocities were committed, but find me a single government that has not committed one.

Anyway, moving away from that digression, are you saying that colonization was wrong therefore the colonized have a right to colonize the colonizers? This is a perfect example of the *tu quoque* fallacy. 

You also seem far too focused on European colonization. Should the Phillipines, Chinese, and Koreans be allowed to immigrate in great numbers to China simply because the Japanese conquered these countries? Have you thought of the implications to Japanese culture or have they forefeited their right to have a culture simply because they altered the culture of others (as their own culture was altered in its formative period were influenced by Chinese and Korea culture)?

Indeed, if we follow your argument to its logical conclusion, we can see how the British Empire was totally justified simply because England was itself subject to colonization by not only the Normans, but also the Danes, the Anglo-Saxons, the Irish, etc.

False,1,0,,"&gt;Once again, anything can be used to do horrible things.  Religion happens to be one of them

Religion is one of the most effective tools for that though.  I only know of one other comparable tool and that is nationalism.

&gt; but I still stand by my statement that Christianity does more good than bad. 

Yet I've shown that in many it does not.  Your statement contradicts the omissions you have made about the evils carried out under christianity.

&gt;The modern missionary is very different than the colonists of years past.

Yet another omission about the evil carried out using christianity.

&gt;just because there are good non christians and evil people who claim to be christians does not mean that Christianity does not make people ""good"", whatever that means.

I think you know what it means, regardless of the phrasing.  My point was that if christianity made people good, there would not be so many evil christians, and it especially wouldn't be as effective a tool for evil.  It was said because of the naive way you see your religion, whilst realising the reality of religious evil that I point out.

&gt;One Christian organization I would encourage you to check out is called the Congo Initiative. They work in the DRC to provide education amongst many other things to try and help the nation rebuild itself.

Interestingly, christianity has been in the Congo for the hundreds of years.  The majority of the people there are christian.  Looks like they need something different, christianity hasn't helped them.  Their problems are political, this is easily ignored if the goal is to simply spread christianity.  Religion doesn't deal with the problem, they need security, law and order far more than yet more churches.  If countries needed christianity, much of Europe would be in a far worse state than the Congo.

&gt;I completely agree with you that there are many Christians who are focusing on the wrong things, but this does not deter my faith at all.

That is the problem with faith, those christians have faith that they're the ones doing the right christian thing.  Faith is obviously a very poor basis for determining such things.

&gt;I'm probably starting to sound like a broken record, but people who abuse others in the name of God are extremely misguided and wrong in their actions. 

But how do you know this, what makes you so sure that other christians, who use the bible as a reference, are wrong and you are right?

&gt;I do not believe that taking religion out of the equation would change people wanting to have power over others.

There are no reasons for denying people condoms except for religious ones.  The same goes for abuse against those accused of withcraft and demonic possession.  Removing religion won't make the world perfect, but it will remove one of the most damaging influences.  Imagine the middle east without religion, for just one very powerful example.  **There are very few things people will so readily spill blood and commit atrocities over than religion.**

&gt;They need Jesus Christ, not religion. I see no contradiction.

The two are inseparable.  I think you are trying to play semantics here.

&gt;The message is perfect, the messengers are not.

If the message were perfect, these things would not be easily justifiable using the message.  The message is evil, insane, contradictory and open to a wide variety of interpretations.  Your interpretation is just one.  It is clearly not perfect.

&gt;I don't think that Africa needs any kind of abuse-causing ideology. A cursory reading of the teachings of Jesus will reveal that any kind of abuse is wrong.

Let's try a cursory reading, hmm, there's something about not letting anyone suffer a witch, violent exorcism of a demonic possession, racism, eternal torture for unbelievers.  Not looking too good is it?  And that's not even touching on the psychotic first half of the bible.

&gt;Any person who calls themselves a Christian and proceeds to rape, torture, or kill is a hypocrite.

Even if it's in the name of converting them to christianity, ensuring that they avoid hell?  According to christianity, anything, even torture, would be better than letting someone die a heretic/witch and burn for eternity/side with the devil.  This is a reasoning which led to horrifying atrocities carried out by christians for hundreds of years.

&gt;It teaches that if you don't repent for your sins and ask for forgiveness from God that you do not get to spend eternity with Him; but that is not the point of being a Christian. That is pretty much the only requirement to being a Christian, the other stuff is what naturally follows. I can question anything I want.

Even question why we're born with sins, or why blood and sacrificing makes sin disappear, or how a god can be killed with a spear, or how jesus can be god and the son of god simultaneously?  There are some things christians can not question.  If you question the bible too much, you will end up losing your faith, something which leads to horrifying consequences according to christianity.

False,3,0,,"&gt;Here's my problem

all you AFC guys that have been posting recently... read THIS and feel GOOD
about yourselves.  I mean go out there and snag some pussy... don't get
LAZY... but I think this is the WORST example I have EVER SEEN :(
&gt;I've met this beautiful model two years ago at a trade fair where she
&gt;was working as a fashion model.

you are now 2 YEARS DEEP in being a ""GIRLfriend"" to her instead of a MAN!
good luck climbing out of that shit :(
&gt;She had a boyfriend and lived together
&gt;with him. I was 43 and she  23.  I worked as a sales manager for a
&gt;fashion retailer with clothing shops in Europe. I am married but since
&gt;my wife has a seriously disease and need my help I don't want or can
&gt;divorce her now.
&gt;
&gt;Well, we quickly started a great conversation immediately.. So we
&gt;really liked each other..

you liked her PUSSY, she liked your MONEY and potentially your PERSONALITY.
that is a MIS-MATCH.  she will NEVER see you as a SEXUAL MAN until she
admires your SEXUAL PROWESS instead of your WALLET.
&gt;We also talked about to have dinner
&gt;sometime.

uh-oh.  dinner for what?  you SHOULD have discussed what you require of her
in a sexual relationship and when she said she wasn't going to fuck, you should
have baited her with ONE GOOD DINNER, then cut her off and told her you
don't want to hear from her again unless she is telling you that she wants you to
take her to a hotel and fuck her.  make her HUNGRY for your $$$ and then let
her know that she isn't going to get the benefit of your money OR your
personality if she's not sexing you.  those privileges are reserved for REAL
WOMEN!
&gt;I planned to use her as a model for our fashion shows in Europe.  As
&gt;a ""prepayment"" I gave her some nice clothing that we had used at the
&gt;fair and she also worked for us at a fashion show in Germany.

now you have established that you have money and connections.  JERK THAT
SHIT AWAY FROM HER and watch her crawl to you for it.  if she doesn't crawl for
it, she's not going to suck you off either.
&gt;3 month later she told me she wanted to have the dinner with me and we
&gt;really had a great evening together, just like we were the best
&gt;friends, that is: no intimacy..

the best FRIENDS?  what made you and her FRIENDS?  what did she like about
YOU? is that what you were dating her for... to make a female FRIEND?  if so,
what is this post about?  why did you like her?  because she is beautiful AND
refuses to give you sex?  what was your goal?  what were you trying to get
from her in exchange for this dinner?  what was the dinner a reward for?
nothing.

you were HOPING that through buying her stuff and taking her out, that would
turn on some sex shit in her.  it doesn't WORK like that.
&gt;We started to see each other and had
&gt;nice dinners ( with me paying ).

you are her girlfriend
&gt;We walked holding arms together from
&gt;the restaurants, but nothing more..

you are her girlfriend
&gt; We did hug each other, but we never kissed.

you are her girlfriend
&gt;We kept talking on the phone every week.

you are her girlfriend
&gt;She told me she didn't liked here boyfriend
&gt;and that she wanted to move to an own apartment
&gt;as soon as possible.

you are her girlfriend  AND now she knows you will spend ALL of your money
on her with NO RECIPROCATION from her.  she will milk your ass DRY! :)
&gt;After ""dating"" each other for about 6 months we decided to go to Paris
&gt;a weekend and I arranged a Suit at a nice hotel.

you are her girlfriend
&gt;2 weeks before she told me that she wants to have
&gt;her own room. We had a discussion and
&gt;she told me that she rely liked me and wanted to go
&gt;to Paris with me but she wanted to have
&gt;her own room.

I mean please :(

can you get a clue?  WHAT KIND OF BITCH THAT LIKES YOU AS A *MAN* IS GOING
TO GET YOU TO FLY HER TO PARIS *AND* SET HER UP WITH A ROOM WHERE SHE CAN FUCK
PARISIAN MEN AT WILL?  this whole shit is fucking pathetic :(

let this be a lesson AFCs...  if you KEEP doing what you have been doing,
THIS WILL BE YOU in 20 years!
&gt;We went to Paris and had a nice stay there with shopping, dinners etc.

you are being used.  she doesn't give a shit about you. she doesn't intend
to fuck you.  she is fucking OTHER men that she finds sexually attractive.  you
are footing the bill for her international whoring. stop.
&gt;At the evenings before bedtime  we did hug each other, but when I tried
&gt;to kiss here she said NO and went into her room.

you are being used.  she doesn't give a shit about you. she doesn't intend
to fuck you.  she is fucking OTHER men that she finds sexually attractive.  you
are footing the bill for her international whoring. stop.
&gt;I must fill in the she never never asked me to buy her something.

a DUH!  she didn't have to ask you because you OFFERED HER EVERYTHING!  you
started with dinners and ended with a trip to fuck the studs of paris!  do
the AFCs here now understand why ""can I buy you a drink"" is a DISASTEROUS line? :(
&gt;A few months and several dinners later she told me that she rely liked
&gt;me as a friend.

yes.  you are her GIRLfriend.
&gt;But I should not expect more.

because she is not a lesbian and you have no dick.
&gt;I know that she likes
&gt;tall big muscular men ( like here father ). I am 174 cm ( 5' 7'' ). She
&gt;also started to be very confusing.

no.  you are the one that is confused.

you are being used.  she doesn't give a shit about you. she doesn't intend
to fuck you.  she is fucking OTHER men that she finds sexually attractive.  you
are footing the bill for her international whoring. stop.
&gt;She told me that she didn't liked
&gt;the way I looked and touched at here and she ended our relationship.

you WERE being used.  she DIDN'T give a shit about you. she NEVER INTENDED
to fuck you.  she WAS FUCKING OTHER MEN that she FOUND SEXUALLY attractive.
you WERE footing the bill for her international whoring. SHE STOPPED IT BEFORE
YOU GOT THE CHANCE TO STOP IT :(
&gt;4 months later in September,  we meet each other in a fragrance shop.

uh-oh :/
&gt;She told me she had job in the shop selling fragrance and cosmetics.
&gt;She also told me that she had moved from her boyfriend.

don't do it...
&gt;We started to see each other again and had several nice dinners.

you are being used.  she doesn't give a shit about you. she doesn't intend
to fuck you.  she is fucking OTHER men that she finds sexually attractive.  you
are footing the bill for her international whoring. stop.
&gt;When I visited her job I learned from her friends
&gt;that she had told a lot about me. Who I was, my
&gt;occupation as a marketing manager etc etc.

that you are a hump.  that you give her money for free. that you would
probably buy a girl a car if she even TOUCHED you sexually...
&gt;I felt that everything was set to happen.

HAHAHAHA it's BEEN happening!  YOU just weren't in on the fun :)
&gt;Every time I visited her at
&gt;the shop and when we had dinners, I could see of the body language that
&gt;she liked me.

bitches love $$$... you are right.
&gt;But I don't wanted to risk that she gets mad at me for
&gt;any reason, I just didn't wanted to force anything.   So I didn't hug
&gt;her or kiss her.

it is much better to have her spend all the money that YOU worked hard to
get. do you know how much ACTUAL SEX you could have gotten for all that dinner
and paris money you spent on that worthless bitch?

you weren't FORCING HER to spend your money, now were you? :)
&gt;4 weeks ago we had agreed to have dinner. We decided to see each other
&gt;at the entrance to the shopping mall where the fragrance shop is. When
&gt;I came she was there hugging another guy and she introduced us for
&gt;each other.   She had a relation with the doorman/guard working at
&gt;the shopping mall. ( a tall and muscular guy without brain ).

notice how she was physical with HIM in the way that she CUT YOU OFF for
trying to get physical with her.  HE IS A FUCKING *GUARD* IN THE MALL!  HOW MUCH
MONEY DO YO THINK HE MAKES?  STOP THROWING MONEY AT THIS BITCH!  feed the hungry
or do something good with the money :(
&gt;I must say that I was really confused.

let me clear things up for you...

you are being used.  she doesn't give a shit about you. she doesn't intend
to fuck you.  she is fucking OTHER men that she finds sexually attractive.  you
are footing the bill for her international whoring. stop.
&gt;However we had a dinner that evening.

you are the money and entertainment.  he is the DICK that she likes to suck.
any questions?
&gt;I asked what her boyfriend said when she was going out
&gt;with me.  She told me that he had nothing to do with it.

yes he does.  you paid for the outfit he was wearing when you walked up to
the mall :)
&gt;She also
&gt;told me that the relation with the guy was not so very serious and that
&gt;he was peculiar!!

what would you have done if she had told you how she had just finished
sucking his dick before she kissed you hello?  would you have taken her to dinner
and spent more money on her or rushed out to buy Listerine? HAHAHAHAHA :)
&gt;One week later I visited her at the fragrance shop a Friday afternoon.
&gt;We had some small talk an I asked her out for dinner that evening. She
&gt;told me that she couldn't because she should go out with her girl
&gt;friends.

oh please!  there is only one reason she would not go out to spend more of
your money.  she is fitting to ride his BALONEY PONY!  hehehehe :)
&gt;I was then told by one of her girl friends that she and  the
&gt;boyfriend had visited the guys parents that Friday.

can you get a clue?  mr. WHORE-FINANCIER?
&gt;I got a lot of unanswered questions in my mind. .. I am so damn
&gt;confused... I would appreciate any advice, tip, or ideas by anyone,..
&gt;( after reading this myself, I must consider myself to be a total

Sure if you want to live in a 700 square foot flat and have a fantastic internet connection and great healthcare, you can do that in Europe and Japan.  You can do it in the US too.  The US has fantastic Internet access available as well as fantastic healthcare available . . . if you want to pay for it.

[Here](http://mjperry.blogspot.com/2007/10/us-cancer-survival-rates-are-lowest-in.html) is a chart by a University of Michigan professor on cancer survival rates in the U.S. versus the UK and the EU.  Below is some information about UK and Canadian health care versus U.S. health care from U.S. economist John Goodman:

**UK versus U.S. Health Care:**
&gt;Britain has only one-fourth as many CT scanners per capita as the U.S., and one-third as many MRI scanners. The rate at which the British provide coronary-bypass surgery or angioplasty to heart patients is only one-fourth the U.S. rate, and hip replacements are only two-thirds the U.S. rate. The rate for treating kidney failure (dialysis or transplant) is five times higher in the U.S. for patients between the ages of 45 and 84, and nine times higher for patients 85 years or older. Overall, nearly 1.8 million Britons are waiting for hospital or outpatient treatments at any given time.

**Canadian versus U.S. Health Care:**
&gt;The proportion of middle-aged Canadian women who have never had a mammogram is twice that of the U.S., and three times as many Canadian women have never had a Pap smear. Fewer than a fifth of Canadian men have ever been tested for prostate-specific antigen, compared with about half of American men. Only one in ten adult Canadians has had a colonoscopy, compared with about a third of adult Americans. These differences in screening may partly explain why the mortality rate in Canada is 25 percent higher for breast cancer, 18 percent higher for prostate cancer, and 13 percent higher for colorectal cancer. In addition, while half of all diabetics have high blood pressure, it is controlled in 36 percent of U.S. cases, compared with only 9 percent of cases in Canada.

&gt;Make jobs less hard, not painful, not unpleasant and people will keep working till they are close to dying. And be happier and healthier as well.

I'm not really sure what your definitions are of hard, painful and unpleasant are.  My experience is that the change from person to person.  I don't want an easy job.  I watch my dad work in the Air Force for 22 years, being gone an average of 270 days a year and regularly working 12-20 hour days.  He thrived on it.  I *want* a hard, challenging job, and almost everyone I know wants one, too.  Unpleasantness varies from person to person.  I would hate to work in as a dentist, but I know people who want that as their career.  I guess there's always being a garbage man.  But then again, it has good pay and somebody's got to do it.

&gt;Train them so when they get older they will have sit down jobs. Let them work part time when they are older.

If that is at all possible, then I think it sounds like a great idea.  But I tend to think that it might not always be that simple.  Often the ""sit-down"" jobs at companies that require a lot of standing, are managerial positions.  Typically, those go to the most qualified, not the oldest workers.  Obviously that's not always the case, but you can't just make an older worker a manager or a secretary; it requires a certain skill set.

Working part time also sounds good, but this requires that companies hire more employees.  One worker who can work 10 hours a day is cheaper than two workers working 5 hours a day.  Where would this money come from?

Actually there are plenty of proprietary standards which are freely available to read and free to implement but do not follow a collaborative development process. Are they more or less Free than one where you can be involved in the development of the standard but must pay [$0.20 per user to license it for over 100,000 users or $0.00 per user for less than that?](http://www.mpegla.com/avc/AVC_TermsSummary.pdf)

&gt; This is why you can't call it an open standard. H.264 is patented.

Sorry but you are wrong. Open Standard is a legally defined term in many places and charging implementers to use the standard is not precluded in many of them. I am not the one calling it an open standard so much as it is the ITU-T and it's member organisations who do.

The most universal quality of Open Standards is that they are developed and maintained through collaboration and consensus. Yes, many people (e.g. Microsoft, OSI, W3C) say that they should be royalty free but both the ITU-T and the EU do not preclude royalties being charged on supposedly open standards.

The Open Source movement needs to get out of this idea that Freedom and money are opposites. Just because something is patented doesn't make it bad. H.264 contains many innovative technologies which is exactly why it is so good. It's not covered by something stupid like the 1-click patent that really doesn't deserve protection.


Edit: I just went through and read the MPEGLA license agreement for H.264/AVC in more detail. (Which seems to be something most people participating in these discussions haven't done.) Currently there is no license requirement for use of H.264 for internet broadcasters.

Also, would you really deport women back to Iran to be stoned for adultery or children back to North Korea (long shot that any ever make it here I know).  That’s the reason we have asylum policies.

I think we should accept some people on moral grounds.  That said, it should be faster and cheaper to decide who we keep and who we don’t.  One way to do that is to have a safe list (who we return people to no questions asked) and also a not safe list (who we never return people to).

&gt;I think it's a bit odd that NO2EU said they would refuse to take their seats in European parliament, it seems a bit pointless then.

It was one of our more controversial stances. The idea behind that is firstly it completely avoids anyone getting on the gravy train (as opposed to UKIP, who complained about the 'gravy train' then had two of their MEPs caught out abusing it), secondly it backs the idea of the EU Parliament being a powerless farce which was the emphasis behind the '-Yes to Democracy' part. Thirdly, we support the idea of the ballot box and parliamentarianism being the most blunt of all political instruments, the No2EU MEPs would've campaigned for workers rights outside of the EU Parliament having it, essentially, as their full time job

Needless to say it wasn't hard to shoot him down (if UKIP voters were so silly they didn't even know UKIPs party name did they know their policies? Critical analysis of the votes shows the BNP didn't really gain, it was mainly the fact the number of voters dropped that let them in and you can't really blame anyone BUT the BNP voters for their seats). I don't think this particular member grasped just how different we were from them (for instance when I told him that we wern't against a united Europe just against the EU he said our name was stupid and questioned our democratic credentials).

False,9,0,,"The issue is how do we let them fail? Many of these companies are so massive (because they were not properly _regulated_) that if they were to fail, the collateral damage would take down many of the 'good' companies with them. Effectively, we need to control the rate at which we downsize a company like AIG, since AIG insures -- well... everyone on Wall Street -- just 'letting them fail' isn't an option, if we did, Wall Street would take a very hard drop, lots of 'good' or -- more so -- 'innocent' companies that rely on capital generated from Wall Street will fail, those companies will then have to lay off workers and close plants/branches/etc to cut costs, increasing unemployment and underemployment. This results in less spending on our part, which results in less income in the companies, which means more job loss. 

This is roughly how you have a Depression. Ideally, you don't ever get into this position in the first place. By properly policing companies like AIG, we could have avoided this mess. But due to some legislation [1] passed repealing some post-Great Depression Regulation (which would have prevented  the kinds of naughty things AIG was doing) We end up in this position. Now, the last time we had this kind of problem, the Great Depression, we solved it via a massive spending program, the Lend-Lease Acts, which were part of the New Deal. These acts had the government spend massive amounts of capital buying and lending/leasing war materials (guns, ammo, etc) to the Allies in Europe. The Government effectively ""sold on spec"" to Britain and France. This resulted in those companies having lots of money to hire workers. When we entered WWII and started drafting soldiers, we created many more jobs -- not only in having the jobs being vacated by the exiting soldiers filled by the ladies left behind, but also by creating the military jobs themselves. This stimulus encouraged more spending, more spending meant the companies had room to expand, and we have a growing economy.

The idea of 'just letting them fail' is pleasing in an ethical sense. I think AIG is composed of shitbags who I'd like to punch in the face. I'm sure your feelings are similar. AIG, and the rest of the corporate bastards who made decisions which any person in their position should have known were stupid, make me sick. However, regardless of my moral indignation against these idiots, we need to rise above the black and white view of 'right and wrong' 'reward and punish' notions that the 'just let them fail' idea proposes. Rather, we need to use this as an opportunity for to enforce strong regulation to prevent this kind of idiocy from happening again.

I've also coached an international team at another top European school, and got the same impression from them.  Maybe our school was just a bit more laid back in terms of personalities, who knows.

False,2,0,,"&gt; The silly thing is that Valve has a mature engine for years now, and the main advantage of using a mature engine is that you don't have to worry much about hardware specific aspects, as these are abstracted away from you by the engine. So the only thing Valve needs to do is make their engine work on PS3.

The problem with that is that porting the engine to make full use of the Cells is  probably a very great deal of work indeed, and would be extremely disruptive.

It simply may not be possible to optimise stuff for the PS3 when the existing API calls for that feature must be addressed to the wrong part of the engine. The cells seem to be used for quite different tasks than what is conventionally just thrown at the GPU.

It probably requires a ground-up rewrite of the engine, and consequently of the games that are to be built upon it, and Valve may feel they can't justify that for a console generation that may last only 3 more years.

I have to agree that Valve's attitude towards the PS3 looks like stubbornness, and I wonder if they may come to regret it. Here in Europe Playstation is a very strong brand, and I know a number of 20-30 year olds who have bought PS3s because they loved their PS2, or just on the basis of the Playstation name. I think that here the PS3 already outsells the 360, if not quite in terms of total units shifted, and the PS3 will continue to look more attractive in the next couple of years as developers learn to take better advantage of its abilities.

I've chatted to PS3 developers, and they all say that it takes a while to get used to at first. The thing that they remark on, though, is that the SPUs can eat as much as you throw at them - if you can offload a task to the SPUs, then that task is done with basically no performance cost to your game. Anything you can do with the SPUs, it then becomes ""free"" computing power.

I'll add this here next bit here, because I'm not going to reply to every post in the thread (the discussion in these 360 vs PS3 threads does seem to become a bit of a random free-for-all). I do agree that the PS3 isn't going to last the claimed decade as Sony's top-tier console, although I'm sure titles will continue to be released for it even after the PS4 becomes mainstream, just as new PS2 titles are still available now. Microsoft will have to come out with a replacement for the 360 in another couple of years - when the new Xbox 720 or whatever it's called becomes the new ""next gen"", then I can't see Sony allowing themselves to be ""last gen"", and I'm sure they're already preparing for this.

However some of the comments above suggest the PS4 will be an incremental or ""evolutionary"" update, adding more SPUs or Cells, allowing Sony's developers to continue taking advantage of what they've learned this generation, and kickstarting them ahead into the next generation. I'm not sure that that's by any means clear - [Sony sold their interest in Cell manufacture 2 years ago](http://www.engadget.com/2007/10/18/sony-sells-cell-to-toshiba/), so the no longer have such a vested interest in this processor platform, and one might assume they have lost their access to preferential pricing on the Cell, too. Thus the architecture of the PS4 must come down to performance-over-price - does the Cell offer the ""unlimited"" gains that Sony hoped for?

I, and Hamas, say that Hamas is fighting for that. This is the political issue here. Hamas wants to impose Sharia on everyone, you think the Jews should accept that since there are more Muslims.

&gt;That means it has not happened to us that can read.

Yes, Hamas has not won yet. Is that a surprise to you?

&gt;The Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Avigdor Lieberman wants to ethnically cleanse (or worse) the non-Jews in Israel.

Yes, the brand new government of Israel has some very bad ideas. Almost as bad as the ideas that the Palestinians have been fighting for for years.

False,3,0,,"The only problem I really see is the fact that these institutions are depending way too much on representative democracy. I guess in a way that's understandable given the issues they're dealing with (intergovernmental ones) demand specialization and expertise, but I wouldn't really feel comfortable having a president of North America. The only reason the EU has been held back thus far is because actual citizens of some of these countries have voted down referendums authorizing power to the EU, so the politicians have no control. They have to convince the citizens to authorize it. That's how it should be done, but given there's no national referendum system in America, that's not really possible here, so I'm afraid it's just going to go forward without much input from us.

As far as world government goes, there's just so much to deal with; so much diversity. For the world government to not make policies that really harm people they'd have to concern themselves with really benign and inconsequential matters that can be implemented universally. 

Instead of just being military agreements that don't really hold up, are hard to coordinate, or may not be internationally-recognized, this would make things the same everywhere. It would make, say, the Canadian, Mexican, and United States military the same entity. Kinda tough when there's at least 3 languages used among us, but it's worse in the African Union and the European Union, of course. I'm talking about continental unions still, simply because it's hard to even imagine the dynamics of an actual world government. I don't really see there being a reason for a military under a world government, really, unless we're planning on fighting other worlds, that is. 

These unions are great for less economically prosperous nations. Can you imagine the border being essentially non-existent between Mexico and the United States? Things would change pretty dramatically. 

As I said, Jean-Jacques Rousseau (one of the fathers of democracy) postulated that the bigger the electorate, the more the government takes on a totalitarian nature. This is almost always the case. There's something like 4 billion people in Asia. Whatever they decided on would pretty much be the official policy. That's probably why these continental unions are being set up; they're more representative of the citizens living there. 

I don't know. I've been researching it a lot lately. It's kind of exciting to think things could be changing so radically. (Americans voting for members of parliament? That's kinda wonky.) Then again, I don't want excitement to take precedent over stone cold rationalism, which is called for when dealing with things such as this. 

I will say that the [Union of South American Nations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_South_American_Nations) is one that really excites me, particularly because there are a lot of leftists who have been instrumental in the process, such as Evo Morales and Hugo Chavez.

There is certainly some evolution which has lead to some evolution since homo-sapiens left Africa. The most obvious are varied racial characteristics, things like the ability to digest Lactose, and heightened immunity due to plagues.

&gt; One obvious way to test hypotheses about these changes would be to sample ancient DNA from skeletons. In this way, we could see if the new selected alleles are in them or not. 

&gt; This spring, a paper by Burger and colleagues (PNAS) sampled ancient European skeletons, Neolithic skeletons, for the lactase persistence allele. They didn't find any who had that allele -- not a single one, and this is in Neolithic populations where today the allele is up over 90 percent in frequency. What is going on there?

&gt; In this case, it is quite obvious by considering population genetics. We have a very good date for this lactase persistence allele, from many sources -- it is around 6000-10,000 years old. And you can see in the figure, a new selected allele will remain at a very low frequency for a long, long time after its origin. Here, these skeletons were sampled at a time when the selection pressure favoring the allele was present, but the allele had not yet increased to a substantial frequency. 

&gt; In fact, this allele would have been rapidly increasing through these intermediate frequencies much more recently -- we're talking here about Roman times. And today it is over 90 percent in Scandinavia, but considerably lower in Italy and Southern Europe. 

There is this interesting paper:

False,9,0,,"First of all – I want to thank you all guys. You really made me feel like there is someone who cares. Sorry it took me so long to reply, but I had to gather my thoughts together first. 

The story, really, is simple as pie – I fell in love with a female friend. I’m happy to say that I’ve already got her out of my system though. It took me a year of not seeing her or talking to her. What annoys me though is that it is the second time it happened. I swore to myself the first time it wouldn’t happen again, and I thought I acted quite well the second time it happened, but I ended up heart-broken again. 

A little background story. I’m a college student in Europe and I used to live in a dorm. A new girl moved in about 1.5 years ago and we sort of became friends.

My ‘female friend’ made it clear from the beginning that she had a boyfriend and wouldn’t break up with him, but never quite discouraged me. She only protested when I tried to kiss her or got touchy-feely with her in my bed. Put simply – she wouldn’t kiss me or have sex with me. 

After such altercations we wouldn’t see each other for a few days, and then get together again. I mean, when we were together it felt like we belonged together. It’s hard to explain, but I feel that this case was different than the one described in this thread. She wasn’t always acting like she only wanted us to be friends – she would want me to put my arms around her waist whenever we were hanging out with other people or dance with me while giving me a sexy look and stuff like that. Or call me and talk to me for hours on end. Or bake me a cake for my birthday (oh crap, it hurts to remember this stuff).

Our ‘friendship’ only lasted for about 3 months.  It ended without a major fight or argument. It’s just that when she came back from the spring break she brought her boyfriend with her and he stayed with her for a week. (It needs to be added that her boyfriend initially stayed in her home town while she moved to our city to go to college).
In that week she didn’t talk to me once. In fact, when I saw them together she seemed embarrassed. When I found out she had brought her boyfriend with her I got drunk. I couldn’t take it. I prayed to all deities they would relieve me of this crazy illness called love. It helped little. So I decided I wouldn’t talk to her again.

What followed was the most devastating summer of my life. I still lived in the same dorm and saw her from time to time. Every time I saw her I would go by and say hi, and she would mutter something undistinguishable, but it hurt like hell to see her and not to be able to see her, to hang out with her, to touch her. At the end of the summer I moved out because I couldn’t take it any longer. A few months later I found out she moved out a couple of weeks after me. I still don’t know if she is still in this city or not. Rumor has it she went back to her home town. I don’t want to find out for sure.

Oh well, I could go on about this story forever. Hope you guys are not bored by this time. You probably are. Well, I’m over it now. I used to have dreams about her until recently, but the dreams seem to have stopped now. I am a healthy individual again, enjoying life and stuff. 

Thank you for your attention.

False,1,0,,"OK, I think I see the objection here, and I think there's room to meet in the middle.

To paraphrase your own argument, nationalization != ""socialized medicine"" != single-payer health care.  Does putting the *producers* of health care under government control work?  No, no more than nationalizing farmers would.  I'm definitely not suggesting that, and no plan that's been seriously proposed at the national level has suggested that.  And as far as I'm aware none of the countries held up as health care successes have done so.

What *has* worked is to have a single entity (government) pool all the citizens, distribute health risk and use its collective bargaining power to get a good deal for them when it comes to buying care from private providers.  In most cases where socialized medicine exists, this is coupled with an arrangement paying for the care through taxes and thus pooling costs as well.  This is the European/Canadian/rest-of-the-world model, and statistically and financially speaking, it works.

The argument for a single payer or socialized (and again please distinguish those from ""nationalized"") health care plan is extremely similar to the one you lay out for food stamps: it subsidizes the sick at a cost to the well, and with socialized care also subsidizes the poor by equalizing costs (taxes) to income.  

Frankly, I would be thrilled even with single-payer, even if there was no socialization involved.  I have no health insurance right now.  If I got insurance again, ""pre-existing conditions"" would screw me in huge ways.  My experience with insurer-provided care has universally been negative; every time I've had some sort of issue the health care got billed for, they have rejected my claim and it's all been out of pocket.  I would be more than happy with only basic coverage at reasonable cost: I just want care that *works*, and companies that provide for-profit care by making profits off of me don't do that.

False,0,0,,"&gt;Ah, I think you have the assumption that Bible should be a clear source of instruction, like a textbook. That would certainly be nice, but it is not the case. Reading the Bible is more like interpreting a work of art. You might take away ideas not directly intended by the artist, and that is part of the experience.

There's clarity and then there's the bible, it is the direct opposite of clear.  It is shoulder to shoulder with insane, evil and confusing.  Reading the bible is like looking at a diary of a schizophrenic, high on acid.  Assigning completely different meanings to most of everything written in the bible is beyond a joke.

Imagine a republican politician happily murdering a baby on live tv and then a fox news ""reporter"" saying people have misinterpreted his intention, or don't understand politics.  That's the type of comical apologetics you've displayed here.  **This is the same nonsense as the emperor's new clothes**, the exact same thing.

&gt;You are free to discard the Bible and use pure human reason. 

I know of many who were forced to praise jesus and learn about the bible whilst growing up.  It's nothing short of brain washing.  Many are not free to discard it.

&gt;Christian teaching suggests that you do not need to have read that Bible to know God, for the name of God is ""written on the heart of every man.""

Christian teaching claims that not accepting jesus will mean you end up being tortured in hell for eternity.

&gt;Christian scholar Brian MacLaren writes: ""As in so many issues these days, the problem isn’t the Bible; it’s the assumptions we bring to the Bible about how it is supposed to be interpreted. 

But how do you know how it's to be interpreted, let alone how you know that messages in the bible actually mean the exact opposite on an arbitrary basis?  We come back to my point that it's an unnecessary and dangerous stumbling block towards [morality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality) and [ethics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics).

Fox news could be interpreted similarly, people could say there's great merit to watching it and trying hard to decipher the actual message, or what's really going on.  But you'd be far better off just turning to a real news medium.

&gt;We make demands of the Biblical writers that we don’t make of any other writers,

Really, is no other writer expected to make at least some sense, be at least somewhat coherent, to be at least a little sane?  Anyone writing something like the bible today would seriously have their sanity questioned.

If the bible is going to be used by people to affect society, politics and law as strongly as it does, then yes, it should at least make some sense.

&gt;and I’m not sure our demands are sensible or fair at all. As an analogy, I often refer to the Wizard of Oz in my teaching. Does this mean that I believe Dorothy was a historical figure? No. It means that I accept the story of Oz as being part of our culture, 

The bible is supposed to be a testament.  Everyone knows The Wizard of Oz is a fictional story, the same can not be said for the bible.  To my knowledge no one has used the story of Oz as a basis for committing atrocities.  If Dorothy murdered children, promoted racism, condemned characters to be tortured, etc, whilst heralded as a model person, an example to children, you can bet there'd have been an outcry.  No one would have said *that's a misinterpretation* and been taken seriously.

&gt;Certainly, the literary work of the Bible has had a tremendously destructive influence on history. But it has also had a positive influence, by encouraging the development of universities, hospitals, judicial systems, the practice of rhetoric and scholarship, charitable organizations and service.

It's negative impact outweighs the positive.  The early [universities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University#History) were developed far more by non-christians.  The reading of non-christian literature was opposed.  Libraries were burned to the ground throughout Europe.  Knowledge was lost, many books destroyed forever.  It was only during the advent of medical science (also opposed by christianity) that hospitals became useful.  It was possible during a revival of the values and teachings (saved by Arabs) of the ancient (pagan) Greeks.  Universities, our judicial system, [rhetoric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric#The_history_of_rhetoric_in_western_civilization) and scholarship owe far, far more to the work of ancient (pagan) Greeks, than they ever would to the bible.  Charity exists outside of christianity, ask yourself why some of the most charitable nations on the planet are very unreligious (e.g. Norway, Sweden, Japan).

Besides, christianity has a strong negative impact on academia, medical science and the judicial system today.

&gt;Even without a full accounting if the good and bad, tossing out the Bible as a whole seems to be hasty. Doing so only further divides evangelical believers from freethinkers.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""freethinkers,"" if you mean atheists in any way, then evangelical believers draw the division at not believing in jesus as god.  Anyone on the wrong side of their line are viewed in a very negative way.

What we need to do is not peddle nonsense like ""21st century Western morality, worldview and even law is heavily informed by scripture,"" when it isn't and it shouldn't be.

False,1,0,,"**Re: Women's work**

I think if this caricature was real and someone called childcare ""women's work"" in this context you(and I) would blow our top at the insult.  In the caricature you painted of Enphuego, I think that was the obvious interpretation.  If you honestly meant ""work that happens to be overwhelmingly staffed by women"" when you puppeted a misogynist saying ""women's work"" I wholeheartedly apologize misinterpreting you.

As for a lawsuit, I don't believe there is clear sexism driving this to justify it.  I will concede the salaries may have not caught up with the increased demand for childcare in the last 20-40 years, but that is a problem with the field.  The market is not some magic, instant machine and these things take time.

However, I don't see any convincing argument here that the people are being discriminated against on the basis of gender rather than simple market lag + non-money benefits and I am highly suspicious of disproportionate effect arguments in a society as relatively educated and socially-mobile as a European democracy.  

A person's employment track may be relatively pre-determined in a less developed nation, but if the job really does require the years of training and qualifications the author indicates, then we are dealing with a class of highly-educated people who have the power to make informed choices about their education and  other life choices and choose their own careers based on what they value most.

Clearly they are getting something out of it besides raw cash or maybe the job just isn't as bad as she claims it is, or else everyone who possibly could would flee the field.

To use the example the article uses, the author's entire premise requires we accept that gravedigging requires little or no real qualifications.  Fine, lets accept that.  
Would you dig graves all day?  I certainly wouldn't because it sounds bloody boring and painful, and I doubt this lady would stick with it either.  There is more to the work equation that the number on the weekly paycheck.

This isn't just theoretical either.  Years back I took an *huge* pay cut to move from the private sector to the educational sector.  My life is better because of it because the work is more fulfilling and it is much lower stress than comparable private sector jobs with a much more flexible schedule.

I doubt you could pay me enough to go back.  God knows people have tried.  I correctly recognize this as a choice.




**Re: Enphuego**

I think it is important to make a distinction that what someone wants in a mate and what someone thinks everyone should/must do are 2 very different things.

In choosing a mate, both partners choose someone to complete them.  Someone who is compatible with their personal lifestyle, their personal sexuality and their personal life choices.  If this wasn't the case, every straight person would be a homophobe by default for refusing to date their own gender.

If both partners are comfortable with it and you can afford it there are very good reasons to choose a mate who is interested in things that don't involve/require the pursuit of money, because there is so much more to life than money.  It is perfectly reasonable for 2 people to have this arrangement, and there is nothing inherently sexist about it.

Ep went to great lengths to make it clear that he wants a homemaker *for a mate* because it *works for him and his lifestyle.*  I don't see anything here indicating he thinks everyone should be in this arrangement and in fact went to lengths to point out he was aware his future wife might feel differently and that it was something the couple would have hammer out.

False,3,0,,"No, it's not ""worth"" giving up a basic Constitutional Right.   The thing people don't understand is a majority of Americans don't *want* to give up guns.  It isn't just about the idea that we need them to defend ourselves from criminals.  It is a matter of individual sovereignty, of being a citizen rather than a subject, and about possessing arms as some kind of balance to the present empire we live in the center of.

You don't need to be a right-winger or backwoods type to understand this.  It is enshrined in our history and national identity: We possess arms because we are a Republic and because that is natural and proper for a free Republic.  Ceding the right of self defense to the government indicates a faith or trust in that government.

And I don't think you have to be nuts to distrust the United States government.   It amazes me the degree to which people all around the world are annoyed by, scared by, or alarmed by that power, point out the military adventurism our government is so fond of, and then indicate that it is somehow a good idea to trust the same government - the same government that brought you waterboarding and the My Lai massacre, with a monopoly on weapons.

It is no mystery to me or to any American gun owner that the rest of the world cannot envision a system with built in insurrectionary checks and balances, nor that they can imagine this realistically happening.

But I can.  In the end, ceding all authority to one's government, granting them a complete monopoly on weaponry and force, is an unwise idea.  Our founders were explicit about this, and while I certainly don't expect foreigners to have a respect for or understand what is derisively referred to as our national ""mythology,"" a lifetime of studying politics and trying to figure out why states and empires rise and fall has convinced me beyond a shadow of a doubt that granting the state a monopoly on weapons is a *bad* idea.

In a large way.

It is up to Australians what Australians do.  I hope indeed the common refrain of, ""It can't happen here,"" and ""Things will always be like this: a free democracy"" is true, but somehow I suspect it isn't.

All things come to an end.  Americans will not be so willing to dutifully turn in their weapons no matter what law is passed, and the irony is that it is that fact - the ""gun obsession"" so many outside our borders claim we have - which will, in the end, be our strength.

I think the popular image of the American gun owner is Travis Bickle, from Taxi Driver.  Like we sit in our rooms in front of giant American flags and sweat and tremble and mumble to ourselves, just waiting for a chance to go on a rampage.

In actuality, consider how you personally relate to a kitchen knife.  You approach it gingerly and you might reflect on the fact that it is dangerous or even that it could be used as a deadly weapon.  But you don't sit there and obsess on that knife all day.  This is how Americans relate to their guns.  Guns are more complex, of course.  We clean them, modify them, maintain them, and smith them.

All over the United States, every weekend, thousands and thousands of armed Americans gather together without incident at shooting events, gun shows, and gun ranges, both for sport, and in the context of civilian defense.  It is instructive that shootings never happen at gun shows - often giant events with thousands of guns, thousands of rounds of ammunition, and armed people in close quarters.  It simply doesn't happen.  The idea that guns are a corrupting force, the ""devil's right hand,"" as it were, is a recent phenomenon, and largely a product of the media.  Just as you know when you drive a car that it is dangerous, but can be driven safely, or use a knife, but can be used safely, it is with this same sober respect that Americans treat their weapons.  It is why we get a little tired of being stereotyped as well.  Beyond their practical use, it is also a hobby.  An interest.  A community.  Something fathers and sons do.

At the same time, in the United States every day, millions (literally tens of millions) of people peaceably own firearms and use them responsibly (I carry several days of the week; I have a concealed carry permit in the state of Arizona).  And yes, occasionally someone commits a disgusting crime with firearms.  I say to abridge a right, to insist that the government simply abolish (or I should say, ""refuse to recognize"") a right, on the basis of the minority, is the road to tyranny.  It is true of freedom of speech.  It is true of restrictions on search and seizure, and it is true of firearms.

In the same way as an Australian might not be able to understand (or might be completely aghast at) why Americans refuse to consider gun control, many of us - not all of us, but many of us, are equally aghast at the way Australians buckled and gave theirs up.

Our assumption is that we are made of different stuff.  Of course, time and history will tell who was the wiser.

There are many ideas and habits I would love to import from our European, Australian, and Kiwi friends.  They are worthwhile cultures, and we in the US have something to learn from them.

On this issue, however, and I have considered this at length, they are gravely, gravely wrong.  History warns us repeatedly, like a broken record, that a disarmed populace and a heavily armed government is a bad idea.

I intend to heed its counsel, no matter what laws are passed.  Incidentally, if you have a criminal record in the United States, you cannot buy a gun.  I am uncertain as to whether people who consider guns in the United States understand that people who purchase firearms are subject to a federal background check, which checks criminal history.  It is not true that people can just walk into a store and buy a gun anonymously.

I intend this post as an instructive explanation; I think the debate which could ensue from this is obvious, and it is not my intent to start one here on the main reddit.  However, if you are interested in discussing this further, there are many interesting threads on /r/guns.
