False,1,0,,"&gt;Actually, that isn't really arbitrary. The Constitution is far more than the Amendments; it represents the stability of our country and the way it functions.

But there are still quite a few countries that have changed in a comparable way to the US, but no more, that do not have a constitution that could certainly be seen as being older than the US.  The UK springs to mind initially, although you can rule out most of the rest of Europe.  In any case It isn't all that important.

&gt;I think the ""decline"" of America is overstated, and calling it anywhere near a ""collapse"" would be sensationalist. We are a (comparatively) resourceful and highly educated country by most objective measures.

I would say that the US is as resourceful as any other country, but that it has been extraordinarily lucky and extremely well placed after WWII.  

&gt;I will continue to bet on the future of the USA, because I believe we will recover from this down. You are free to do otherwise, but I still don't understand what you think is going to happen.

I think that there has to be something of a re-balancing.  The US has for a long time managed to use more of the worlds resources and essentially live on the back of other countries (I don't mean this in the context of slavery or even that it was intentional, but it is rather clear that at present work in the US is worth more than work in China, not because the work is any better, but because the US has more capital and therefore takes the profit from both.  Now that the US is rather poorer than it has ever been, it will be interesting to see what happens.

I don't think there will be an implosion of the US, I do think that there will be a general decrease in the standard of living for many, (possibly in western Europe too) and an increase in radical political positions (after all someone must be blamed) and the US will start to see itself marginalised more on the world stage if the dollar is no longer the only reserve currency (if nothing else the US will have to curb military spending).",True,1425979135,False,,t3_8opm3,ajehals,1,t1_c09yqie,,t5_2qh1s,1243858393,Economics,0,0,t1_c09yvcv,c09yvcv

I disagree with you here as the state is only given power by its people.

Economic ties are strong and important, because you don't bomb the person who makes your minivan (or your cheese).

Yes it could easily go the way of Western Europe. Well not exactly as the culture is different but as far as relationships between nations yes it is a real possibility. The reason I compared them to the middle east is because of the high rural populations who lack an understanding of globalization and politics.

&gt; Policies she enacted/enacted under her authority:

&gt;Logging of all phonecalls and emails and internet traffic.

The Interception Modernisation Programme (IMP) is a CESG-driven initiative to maintain capabilities set up a long time ago as part of ECHELON. Although CESG report into the Foreign Office, domestic interception requires the support of the Home Office, therefore Jacqui Smith as Home Office secretary is needed to support this. She doesn't really have much of a choice as the capability and requirements are defined by a AUSCANZUKUS agreement predating her tenure according to a European Parliament investigation.

&gt; National Identity cards.

Originally put forward by Michael Howard in the Major administration. Howard bizarrely opposed his own idea when leading the Tories. Revived by Blunkett. By the time Jacqui came in the HO had already committed to the project.

&gt; CCTVs on literally every corner.

Outdoor CCTV was originally trialled in Bournemouth under the Thatcher administration in 1985. The Major administration brought CCTV to local towns through the 'CCTV: Looking Out For You' report in 1994. Again, Michael Howard was the driver behind this. CCTV installations are not the responsibility of the Home Office but local authorities and other departments (e.g. DfT for speed cameras etc.)

&gt; Behind a law suspending Habeas Corpus as an anti-terrorism measure.

It has been possible to detain someone without charge (at least in England and Wales AFAIK) for 4 days for as long as I remember. This was increased to 7 days by the Terrorism Act of 2000 (Jack Straw), 14 days by the Criminal Justice Act (David Blunkett) and 28 days (John Reid). I don't reject that Smith looked to extend it, but Habeas Corpus has been off the British statute books for a long time.

&gt; Fought to keep DNA/fingerprint records of people without criminal records 

This was introduced by the Major administration in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, although the taking of DNA from people without prior convictions was introduced in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE).

&gt; and after the European Court of Human Rights ruled against her, she tried to circumvent it by only keeping records for 12 years.

Europe's borders are extremely porous in all directions; sea, land and air.  A friend of mine is a Polish hobby pilot who flew to Warsaw frequently before they joined the EU, and he was never controlled upon landing.  

Whether guns go in the public eye or not is also largely irrelevant; smuggling brings in what there's a market for.  If there's a market for guns (and there is), guns will be smuggled.  You can mitigate the damage, step up border patrols, increase punishment, reduce socioeconomic incentives for gun crimes, etc, but you will never remove the influx of weapons into any country.

Furthermore, as I said elsewhere, protection against criminals is only part of it.  Gun ownership is an unapologetically (and justifiably) paranoid deterrent against government or societal overreach -- something the EU might be wise to consider.

I'd rather not argue that (although there's no shortage of people who do), but at very least you'll have trouble proving the opposite.

On the other hand, cultural norms, history of colonisation, immigration, and most of all economic inequality look very strongly related to crime rates.

I don't doubt that concealed carry and so on can drop crime rates a few percent, but the *huge* differences in crime rates between South Africa and Sweden is a lot better explained by their history and social and economic make-up than by trying to shut the gate with a shotgun well after the horse has bolted.

Actually, no. More jews were ethnically cleansed from arab countries in years preceding 1948.

&gt; Even before the Arab armies you mention, 250,000 Palestinians were cleansed from the urban centers of the Israeli half of the UN partition.

Since the UN partition plan has been rejected by arabs, they have no right to claim that land for which they have no ottoman deeds ""belongs"" to them by the mere fact that they're mentioned in the partition plan.

&gt; This is basically the view of Israel only. No one else takes it seriously. It was not the US policy. It is not the view taken in the Mitchell report. And the US State Department uses the words Occupied Territories. Sorry, bub. Reality, meet MikeSeth. MikeSeth, meet reality.

If you want to talk about reality, this view is irrelevant and Israel will not comply to it. To say that land called Judea somehow ""belongs"" to arabs is absurd. No one has tried to enforce this illegitimate view, and it is not recommended that they try. Nuclear warheads, meet anonymous-coward. Anonymous-coward, meet the principle of sovereignty.

Yes, there is. And it doesn't say anywhere in international law that West Bank and Gaza are (or ever were) occupied territories.

So, what we're being asked to do under the guise of ""returning the occupied territories"" is in fact ""turning over disputed territories."" Even the presumption of ""palestinian"" in ""occupied *palestinian* territories"" is invalid. Nothing makes them ""palestinian"" other than the fact that they used to belong to an administrative unit called Palestine.

but back to the real point - how exactly is gun ownership 'inextricably necessary' for defense? you can only defend yourself with a gun? there are no other ways to do it? isn't a gun just going to aggravate a lot of situations? 

i'm not proposing some unrealistic utopia in saying that gun ownership shouldn't be necessary either, gun regulation is very strict in most western european countries. you're the one being unrealistic in your *dys*topian view that gun ownership is 'inexorably necessary' for defense.

This study is biased and badly researched. Daling claims the study “revealed the connection between use of smoking marijuana and cancer aggravation.” This is a disrespectful blow to the many groundbreaking studies proving the phenomenal medicinal qualities of cannabinoids in marijuana.

“According to an epidemiologist and member of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and co-author of the study, Janet Daling, the increase of the incidence of testicular cancer has been known in the United States and Europe for the last 40 years.” Yes, this is true but why blame cannabis? It’s only the most human sanctioned medication/substance known to man. Why doesn’t Daling instead implicate ddt, chemical fertilizers and pesticides on food and tobacco, mercury, lead, methamphetamine, caffeine, alcohol, jet and car fuels, depleted uranium, pharmaceutical medications and/or high fructose corn syrup in this study, as they have all been linked to serious health issues… mainly strange and specific cancers.

This study effectively disproves itself as Daling then stated “that as they analyzed the data on the study, they found out that no evident relationship exists between smoking marijuana and cancer, specifically testicular cancer.” Yes, exactly, because there IS NO LINK between cannabis and cancer! I would suggest Daling instead focus attention and research money towards studying links between the consumption of high fructose syrup and specific cancers. High fructose was introduced around 40 years ago and was recently found to contain alarming levels of mercury. Yes… all high fructose syrup has, does and will contain mercury. Think about every high fructose corn syrup laden piece of junk food that has been consumed by people of all ages, every day of their lives.

However I listen to metal, jazz, soul, reggae, prog rock, folk, you name it! i'll even listen to the Beatles. But the Beatles were genre specific -they were pop- and are musically a tad boring for many people. 

You must understand, before the Beatles we still had Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, Handel, Wagner (the list goes on), Billy Holiday, Louis Armstrong, Chuck Berry (the list goes on) and a whole lot of other musicians -American and European -  who were as important to the rise of the Beatles as the Beatles are to today's music.

Immersed in such an expansive field of talent and musical diversity, the Beatles are a little bland, musically speaking. (take note of the quantity of songs that are written in pure Major/Minor keys as opposed to the more discordant/minimalist/elaborate keys; not to mention time signatures 2/3/4/8 is about  all Ringo could handle)
If you want to address the fact that they were great writers, i'm sure anyone can give you a comprehensive list of better writers, better poets, better songwriters - just look at any country's traditional gems for example. 

My point is the Beatles were a step in a ladder of musical development and not the pinnacle. If they were the best at anything it was that they were the first band to run like a corporation and hence had enormous resources at their disposal to create the more elaborate later material.

They were also the first band to reach such enormous success on a global scale, however this coincided with the proliferation of the technology of music recording and distribution to the rest of the world. None of this puts them above any of the composers /musicians /genres i've mentioned, it just means they are there as part of musical history. As for appreciation, that is only an issue for the listener and anyone is free to dislike what they hear. I don't dislike the beatles, but i hear them and i hear where they got the music from, i hear the influences on them and i often find those influences a tad more interesting. 

As for music that came after the beatles? I don't really like the mainstream, which is what they influenced the most. Other than that i think vlance's comment about tolkein above sums up my view on that.

For while, the european nations stepped on china and cracked jokes with china as the butt.

I do believe that this is why chinese people are so sensitive.  For a long time they've been the laughingstock of the world, and when they finally start their climb up the ladder of society, they get laughed at and ridiculed/critisized even more.

This was why the Olympic games in beijing was so important to us.  For chinese people around the world, it was finally the proof that china was a world power and should be respected.  That's why china went all out on the ceremony, so they could show the world that they were truly a great nation.

1. Police are arresting kids who have committed no crime, and keeping their DNA forever on the basis that it will serve as a deterrent to crime.

2. When the public half-heartedly protests, they respond: ""New Government proposals state that youngsters who have only been arrested once for minor offences and been found not guilty will have their DNA profiles destroyed when they reach 18.""

3. In other words, their DNA profiles will still be kept until they are 18 years old, **even though they were not found guilty**. And this is just a proposal, it may never happen, which would continue the current practice of keeping it forever.

I've had my fair share of LSD-esque random crap dreams - one that sticks out in my mind is a dream where I had to repair a little reentry pod in a huge space shuttle that seemed to be made entirely of long copper tubing. After repairing the tubing, I hopped in and was teleported, not launched, into a strange urban environment, sliding through it a la rail shooter, surrounded by Banksy-ian graffiti and skyscrapers that seemed to literally scrape the sky. This dream was easily the most colorful I've ever had, more colorful than a flower garden. Especially the graffiti. It all felt so unnatural. 

Now what's most strange is that I dreamt this all out of order, although I 'felt' where everything was supposed to be chronologically. I started out flying through the street, repaired some tubes, felt the explosion of a shuttle, then took a trip climbing up the tube-ship into the reentry pod...it was a mess. A fascinating mess. I tried explaining it to a friend when I woke up and she was utterly confused. Oh well.




I've had a couple of dreams where I sexed up teachers, although that falls more into the 'disturbing' category, rather than the 'hot' one. My mind isn't nearly as exciting as other peoples in this regard.


There was one pretty awesome dream where I was ascending an infinitely tall staircase - like the Mario 64 one. Except each step I left would fall into the abyss of space. And it was damn cold. I distinctly remember this dream taking forever for me to finish. It turns out that I left the fan on and the room was colder than normal.



Hm. Nightmares. My nightmares seem to always involve restraints of some kind. When I was quite young, I had a dream where I was shackled to a hardwood floor and devoured by large insects. And I've had a few dreams where I get tortured. 


In one particularly creepy dream, had acted as a witness for a crime of some sort, and testified. The person was convicted and received a life sentence - but the person's cronies didn't like that. They took four hostages, and then proceeded to 'christen and kill' three of us and use the last one to exchange their friend out of prison. I was the first to go. So about six screws in my hands and legs later, I willed myself to wake up. All the while, this distinctly Slavic-east-European (sorry, euro-redditors) looking guy wearing a black wife beater and black jeans (sorry, black jean-wearing wife beater-wearing redditors) was whispering nursery rhymes in a different language, apparently trying to calm me down. And he was trying to thumbscrew me into a soft comfy bed, which explains why I was able to flail so much. Maybe they were long screws.

Ashkenazim (about 38% of the national population): Jews whose ancestors came from Germany, France, and Eastern Europe. Most Ashkenazi Jews that settled in Israel were from Russia, Poland, Romania, Ukraine, Germany, Hungary, Czech Republic,North America, South America, South Africa and Australia.

Mizrahim and Sephardim (about 38% of the national population): Most Jewish immigrants to Israel from Iran, Iraq, Yemen, and Syria are considered Mizrahim, and the term has come to refer to Jews whose ancestors lived in Arab or Muslim lands, but did not live in Spain or Portugal. The word Sephardi refers to Jews whose ancestors lived in Spain and Portugal until 1492, and sometimes until later, then spread to Greece, Italy, England, the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe, as well as into the Ottoman Empire and in North Africa. Many Sephardi Jews that settled in Israel from Morocco, Algeria, Turkey and the whole Mediterranean area are descendants from migrants from Spain and Portugal. In modern Israeli Hebrew usage, this category is often included in Mizrahim.Those with origins in Muslim and Arab lands are commonly called Sephardim by their Ashkenazi counterparts, though the majority does not descend from Iberian Jews and are best described as Mizrahi. The Jews of Iran and Iraqi Jews are always considered Mizrahi as well as the Yemenite and Omani Jews.

Italian Jews (about 1% of the national population):[citation needed] Jews whose ancestors lived mainly in central Italy. Due to its history and geographical position, Rome hosted the most ancient continuous Jewish community in Western Europe, dating back to the Roman Empire.

Indian Jews (about 1% of the national population): Jews from five distinct communities in India and also Burma, each with very different origins.

Beta Israel/Falash Mura of Ethiopia (about 2% of the national population): Jews who were initially brought to Israel during Operation Solomon and Operation Moses. Today at least 127,000 live in the country.

So your justification for the mass expulsion of Middle Eastern Jews and theft of their property (which dwarfs the Palestinian exile) is that the Palestinian refugees created an economic burden on those Arab states?

Firstly, even if this were the case, it still doesn't excuse that state sanctioned anti-semitic porgroms which often drove the Mizrahi Jews, who had nothing to do with the establish of the state of Israel, to it.

Secondly, the majority of Palestinians who did flee fled to Jordan and Lebanon, and there were hardly any Jews there to begin with- the majority of whom came from North African states and Yemen- who absorbed no Palestinian refugees at all.

I would say corporatism is where the state effectively or directly controls business through regulation and other legislation.

The key though is that those businesses would not be run for the benefit of the country, but for the benefit of shareholders and that government would use legislation and regulation to favour those businesses.

Besides, the ""locker room"" implications in the US are a myth.

If the clinical risks and potential benefits balance out, the next consideration should be autonomy.  If there is no reason to do a surgery now, shouldn't it be elected, or not, by each person for himself?

True, he would not remember the event, but he would forever live with the results.  Why should you think of it as a decision for YOU to make?  Just because you are allowed to?  You don't need to.  You can allow it to be his decision.  And whatever you decide will not be final anyway.  If you do it, he may attempt to restore what he lost.  Many men do.  Can't get back the real thing, but you can simulate it with stretched skin.

It's important to note there are effects other than those generally considered in the clinical sense.  Sensitivity, for example.  The parts removed by circumcision are very sensitive.  Does that matter?  Who decides if that matters?  Here is a study showing a detailed map of measured sensitivity: http://www.nocirc.org/touch-test/touchtest.php (yes, it was funded by an organization which opposes circumcision.  for some reason, nobody else seems to care about this.)

DoubleTwist violates the GPL, meaning it is an unlicensed use of a *copyrighted* work. This was obviously done deliberately and maliciously, with the intent of withholding information from humanity. Copyrights are governed uniformly under international law; while there are minor discrepancies between polities, if your nation is a signatory in the Berne Convention, the same basic rules apply.

*Patents*, on the other hand, are not governed under international law and vary quite a bit from state to state. For example, while the United States has the concept of a ""software patent"", Europe and many other nations do not. Additionally, software patents exist for incredibly over-broad and vague concepts -- if tested, it is almost certain that prior art would be found for the vast majority of them. The only benefit software patents have is in cross-licensing between monolith corporations, to protect each other from their respective lawyer clans. Newer competitors do not have anything to gain from cross-licensing, however, and are simply sued into oblivion.

Make no mistake, the copyright system, as per the ""default configuration"", is an imaginary construct (that is noted in the Constitution of the United States of America, among other places) designed to leverage huge amounts of control in ways that are, now, completely unneeded.

ALL navigation aids can be shutoff by the military at will. Every land based navaid can be made inoperative during a national emergency, using a program called SCANTANA. GPS, VOR, ILS, even lowly NDB. They can all be shutoff.

Having said that, this has never occurred... not even on 9/11.

The lack of redundancy you mention is not accurate. Obviously, if a satellite fails, they can't launch a replacement right away. However, there are many times when you can use 5,6,7 satellites at once, despite the fact that 2-3 is suitable for enroute nav. So this notion that one fails and you're screwed is just false.

But let's say several satellites do fail at one time... in that case, RAIM kicks in and alerts the flight crew to loss of requires navigation performance. At that point, they would revert to VHF based nav when over land, or INS/IRS based nav over water. Less accurate, but it's your backup plan.

For IFR enroute or terminal ops GPS approval, that goes to the FAA for the states and its EU equivilent in Europe. Every procedure, piece of hardware, etc all have to be FAA approved when used for IFR.

Anyway... long story short, GPS is very reliable and accurate. It IS in use internationally, so any claim that it's unused for international ops is just not consistent with reality.

    * Dharma (ethics and duties)
    * Samsara (rebirth)
    * Karma (right action)
    * Moksha (liberation from the cycle of Samsara)

No, because Canada and Mexico are not European countries either.  Canada's population density is even lower than the United States.  Mexico's is about mid-way between the USA and Europe.  Even still, three cultures intermingling doesn't give a lot of ""cross-pollination"" like in Europe.  The westernized North American cultures are also much younger than Europe.

False,2,0,,"Yes, it's free!   And not free like freedom, but free like free beer!  You don't have to pay for it and you can drink all you like.  You see, there is this magical way of making things free called ""socialization"".  It goes something like this.  People come together and form a government.  then they give some of their money to the government.  the government than uses that money to do things for the people even if they didn't pay any money in.  That money is called taxes, and it's why governments work.

the trick is people who don't pay taxes still get access to goods and services payed for with taxes.  Like public schooling and social welfare programs (ie food stamps).  All payed for by taxes.

Free doesn't mean cost-less, it only means the cost is not directly incurred by the individual gaining the goods or service.

So when you go to the park and you ask someone coming out ""how much does it cost to go in?"", they say ""it's free!"".  You don't have to pay to take your kid to the playground.

public schools are free, public security is free, public health care is free, because you don't have to pay for it to use it.  if i don't feel safe, i can call 911 and have the cops here without paying them anything.

You might say ""well someone has to pay for it"".  And your right.  Those who pay taxes pay for it.  But that's what taxes are for!  Nothing wrong with taxes, they're a very good idea.  Taxes are why civilization works. There's no such a thing as society without taxes.

Question is how to use the tax revenues once their collected.

Here in the good 'ol United States (God bless the USA), we like to spend our taxes on social welfare programs (Medicare, social security) and guns (The United States Armed Forces, kicking ass around the world and keep'n us free).  it's called the guns and butter way of government.

fucking Western Europe and japan found a way to cut out the guns part and use all their taxes for the butter.

How do you think that the culture creators should get paied for their works? Through taxor through fee such as STIM? All artists doesn't make enough to get by on concerts and gigs ?

**Christian Engström:** Artists can continue to make money the same way as today. We have at least 10 years of experience on how massive filesharing affects society (Napster started in 1999). If you look at the statistics, you'll see that the revenue for the the cultural sector has been constant during that period, or even increased somewhat in step with a wealthier society. There have been some changes in the cultural sector, especially regarding music. Record sales have almost halved, but that has led to that those that like misc has gotten money left over to spend on concerts instead, so concert revenues have exploded. This is a huge gain for artists since a typical record deal gives 5-7% to the artist, while at gigs they typically get 50%. Thanks to filesharing, artists actually gets more money and less to the record executives. We think that is an excellent development that there is a very good reason to be pleased about. Some planned economic system to benefit the bureaucrats working at STIM is there no need for.

**Peter Törnblom:** Al-Qaida defeated USA, Bush dismantled constitutional rights that are basic for a free state and democracy.

Thus everyone becomes potential criminals that can be mapped and registered by the state. This disease is now spreading to Europe, many laws in the same general direction have been implemented in European states. How will the Pirate Party stop this from happening to European citizens?

False,3,0,,"The argument for Laver is his two Grand Slams.  I think Donald Budge is the only other guy to win the Grand Slam (you could say he invented the term, borrowed from golf).

There are a few arguments you could make against Laver.  Until 1968, the Grand Slams were not open.  That is, only amateurs could play.  Although pros made nowhere near as much money as they do now, they still made money.  Most pros went on these barnstorming tours, a bit like today's exhibitions and played matches all over.  If you wanted to make a living playing tennis, you need to go pro.

This limited the number of Grand Slams Laver played.  Having said that, if pros were allowed in 1962, Laver probably wouldn't have won a Grand Slam.  Laver struggled against the professionals when he first turned pro.

The other key was the Australian Open.  Until air travel became cheaper, getting to Australia to play was a bit of a pain.  This affected players from, say, the Tilden era.  It was even a pain to play in France or for Europeans to play in the US.

This is why a player like Margaret Court won so many Australian Opens.  Few people were making the trip to challenge her, and she had no competition (plus she was a very good player).

The other knock is grass.  At the time, only the French was played on clay.  Wimbledon, the US Open, and the Australian were all played on grass.

The US Open moved to clay briefly in 1975-1977.  In 1978, they moved to Flushing Meadows and played on the hard courts for the first time.

Sometime in the 80s, Australia moved to hard courts as well.  Ideally, Australia should have moved indoors to create four different surfaces.  They were the first to build a retractable roof, however.  Wimbledon, this year, is the second.

False,1,0,,"Great link - and here's the Senior Counsel to the USS Liberty Court of Inquiry:

Declaration of Ward Boston, Jr.,Captain, JAGC, USN (Ret.)
Counsel to the U.S. Navy Court of Inquiry's investigation into the Israeli attack on the USS Liberty

I, Ward Boston, Jr. do declare that the following statement is true and complete:

For more than 30 years, I have remained silent on the topic of USS Liberty. I am a military man and when orders come in from the Secretary of Defense and President of the United States, I follow them.

However, recent attempts to rewrite history compel me to share the truth.

In June of 1967, while serving as a Captain in the Judge Advocate General Corps, Department of the Navy, I was assigned as senior legal counsel for the Navy's Court of Inquiry into the brutal attack on USS Liberty, which had occurred on June 8th.

The late Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, president of the Court, and I were given only one week to gather evidence for the Navy's official investigation into the attack, despite the fact that we both had estimated that a proper Court of Inquiry into an attack of this magnitude would take at least six months to conduct.

Admiral John S. McCain, Jr., then Commander-in-chief, Naval Forces Europe (CINCUSNAVEUR), at his headquarters in London, had charged Admiral Kidd (in a letter dated June 10, 1967) to ""inquire into all the pertinent facts and circumstances leading to and connected with the armed attack; damage resulting therefrom; and deaths of and injuries to Naval personnel.""

Despite the short amount of time we were given, we gathered a vast amount of evidence, including hours of heartbreaking testimony from the young survivors.

The evidence was clear. Both Admiral Kidd and I believed with certainty that this attack, which killed 34 American sailors and injured 172 others, was a deliberate effort to sink an American ship and murder its entire crew. Each evening, after hearing testimony all day, we often spoke our private thoughts concerning what we had seen and heard. I recall Admiral Kidd repeatedly referring to the Israeli forces responsible for the attack as ""murderous bastards."" It was our shared belief, based on the documentary evidence and testimony we received first hand, that the Israeli attack was planned and deliberate, and could not possibly have been an accident.

I am certain that the Israeli pilots that undertook the attack, as well as their superiors, who had ordered the attack, were well aware that the ship was American.

I saw the flag, which had visibly identified the ship as American, riddled with bullet holes, and heard testimony that made it clear that the Israelis intended there be no survivors. 10. Not only did the Israelis attack the ship with napalm, gunfire, and missiles, Israeli torpedo boats machine-gunned three lifeboats that had been launched in an attempt by the crew to save the most seriously wounded -- a war crime.

Admiral Kidd and I both felt it necessary to travel to Israel to interview the Israelis who took part in the attack. Admiral Kidd telephoned Admiral McCain to discuss making arrangements. Admiral Kidd later told me that Admiral McCain was adamant that we were not to travel to Israel or contact the Israelis concerning this matter.

Regrettably, we did not receive into evidence and the Court did not consider any of the more than sixty witness declarations from men who had been hospitalized and were unable to testify in person.

I am outraged at the efforts of the apologists for Israel in this country to claim that this attack was a case of ""mistaken identity.""

In particular, the recent publication of Jay Cristol's book, The Liberty Incident, twists the facts and misrepresents the views of those of us who investigated the attack.

It is Cristol's insidious attempt to whitewash the facts that has pushed me to speak out.

I know from personal conversations I had with Admiral Kidd that President Lyndon Johnson and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara ordered him to conclude that the attack was a case of ""mistaken identity"" despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

Admiral Kidd told me, after returning from Washington, D.C. that he had been ordered to sit down with two civilians from either the White House or the Defense Department, and rewrite portions of the court's findings.

Admiral Kidd also told me that he had been ordered to ""put the lid"" on everything having to do with the attack on USS Liberty. We were never to speak of it and we were to caution everyone else involved that they could never speak of it again.

I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of that statement as I know that the Court of Inquiry transcript that has been released to the public is not the same one that I certified and sent off to Washington.

I know this because it was necessary, due to the exigencies of time, to hand correct and initial a substantial number of pages. I have examined the released version of the transcript and I did not see any pages that bore my hand corrections and initials. Also, the original did not have any deliberately blank pages, as the released version does. Finally, the testimony of Lt. Painter concerning the deliberate machine gunning of the life rafts by the Israeli torpedo boat crews, which I distinctly recall being given at the Court of Inquiry and included in the original transcript, is now missing and has been excised.

Following the conclusion of the Court of Inquiry, Admiral Kidd and I remained in contact. Though we never spoke of the attack in public, we did discuss it between ourselves, on occasion. Every time we discussed the attack, Admiral Kidd was adamant that it was a deliberate, planned attack on an American ship.

In 1990, I received a telephone call from Jay Cristol, who wanted to interview me concerning the functioning of the Court of Inquiry. I told him that I would not speak to him on that subject and prepared to hang up the telephone. Cristol then began asking me about my personal background and other, non-Court of Inquiry related matters. I endeavored to answer these questions and politely extricate myself from the conversation. Cristol continued to return to the subject of the Court of Inquiry, which I refused to discuss with him. Finally, I suggested that he contact Admiral Kidd and ask him about the Court of Inquiry.

At no time did I ever hear Admiral Kidd speak of Cristol other than in highly disparaging terms. I find Cristol's claims of a ""close friendship"" with Admiral Kidd to be utterly incredible. I also find it impossible to believe the statements he attributes to Admiral Kidd, concerning the attack on USS Liberty.

Several years later, I received a letter from Cristol that contained what he purported to be his notes of our prior conversation. These ""notes"" were grossly incorrect and bore no resemblance in reality to that discussion. I find it hard to believe that these ""notes"" were the product of a mistake, rather than an attempt to deceive. I informed Cristol that I disagreed with his recollection of our conversation and that he was wrong. Cristol made several attempts to arrange for the two of us to meet in person and talk but I always found ways to avoid doing this. I did not wish to meet with Cristol as we had nothing in common and I did not trust him.

Contrary to the misinformation presented by Cristol and others, it is important for the American people to know that it is clear that Israel is responsible for deliberately attacking an American ship and murdering American sailors, whose bereaved shipmates have lived with this egregious conclusion for many years.

I'm not saying anything about future warming. I'm quoting your sources (WRT past warming) back to you. Sources you either do not understand or do not read.

From your [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change):

&gt;&gt;European Academy of Sciences and Arts  In 2007, the European Academy of Sciences and Arts issued a formal declaration on climate change titled Let's Be Honest:
Human activity is most likely responsible for climate warming. **Most of the climatic warming over the last 50 years** is likely to have been caused by increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

Based on [CRU](http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/info/warming/), we had about 0.4-0.5°C warming in the last 50 years. Most of that, by definition, cannot exceed ALL of that. Most would be about 0.2 to 0.4°C. That is what all those academies say. Not me.

Again, you expose your ignorance by lacking knowledge or the ability to understand anything, not even the things you yourself say.

False,1,0,,"&gt;OK but replace ""starting and losing a war"" with ""occupying our lands"" and that's the Palestinians' response. The country that they think Israel is trying to destroy is Palestine. I'm not saying I agree with them, or with you, but that seems to make it a shaky point.

Well here's the thing.  Any Jew who considers Israel oppressed is, IMNSHO, retarded.  And I personally think that the pity-party non-Israeli Jews are always trying to throw for the country goes too far anyway.  We should just up and say, we're a sovereign country now and we've got a right to defend our sovereignty.  Acting like we're cosmic victims when in fact we've managed to overcome that status is stupid.

&gt;I think I understand what you're saying here, but you were initially referring to the rush of Palestinians in 1948. At that time, Israel wasn't as developed, and as far as I understand it, wasn't a country really worth fighting over (from an economic standpoint). Unless the dictators of the surrounding countries had remarkable foresight, it seems unlikely that they would have planned to neglect the Palestinians in order to use them as a political weapon and rallying point for fanatics in the future. It seems more likely that these countries neglected the Palestinians because they couldn't deal with the sudden influx of people, and set up disgusting refugee camps where people starved and lived like dogs.

7 of the first, 5 of the second.  The Arab leaders didn't have foresight, what they had was ideology: pan-Arabism.  The idea among them back then was to create a single gigantic Arab state that would span the entire ""Arab Middle East"" from Iraq through Arabia into the Levant and Egypt.  Israel's existence scuppered that, and so the Arab leaders made the Palestinian Arabs into a refugee/fanatic population and a rallying point for the sake of the ideology they held at that time and to keep their own populations from revolting at how little their governments do for them.

After all, back then the Arab countries were no more developed than Israel.  What more would they have needed to do to give the Palestinian Arabs citizenship than print papers?

Finally, a component of prejudice came into it.  Among all Arabs, Palestinians are considered the lowest *by other Arabs*.  Palestinians are to the Arab Mideast what Jews were to Europe: a hated population that best be kept somewhere far away in their homeland where they can bother someone else even while ""we"" cheer them on and supply them with weapons from a distance.

&gt;Yes, but the alternative is to oppress the Gazans until some internal change makes them stop. As a casual observer it seems obvious that no internal political change can come about because the people are essentially living in a war zone. In a war zone, thugs will always rise to positions of leadership. Thugs will always breed other thugs, and fractious factions will fight for power, propagating the cycle and mentality of war. Furthermore, if you treat the Palestinians like your enemy, they will behave like your enemy, and will look to these thugs to fight for them, and represent them. It's also grossly inhumane to punish the entire population because rockets might fall. Would you close down mines because bullets are made of metal? Then why stop shipments of food because some boxes of food might be used to smuggle rockets?

As far as I know shipments of food get reduced in quality, not quantity.

To answer your larger questions, I understand the logic of the situation, but Israel's relationship with Gaza has become something like a no-win situation.  If Israel allows more into Gaza, rockets come.  If Israel allows less into Gaza, rockets come.  If Israel makes a ceasefire, rockets come.  If Israel goes to war against Hamas in Gaza, rockets come.

I also don't see what can be done for the Palestinian Arabs of Gaza.  Aid shipments are stolen by Hamas.  They can't have much of an economy because trade dies when transport in and out of the Strip gets constricted due to rocket smuggling, yet whenever Israel attempts to make this easier Hamas uses those crossings for smuggling and fires rockets into Israel.  If Israel or the UN actually went in and occupied the Strip to replace Hamas, the people would perceive this as oppression and rally to Hamas.  The only thing I can see that would help is an internal revolution in Gaza bringing to power a government that will genuinely abide by a ceasefire or peace agreement in order to improve the lives of the people there.

Keep in mind, the West Bank is different.  It's run by the PA, which makes honest attempts to collaborate with IDF for security purposes.  As a result, they have a more open economy (though still not as good as Israel's... more comparable to neighboring Jordan or Syria).

To make things worse, neither Hamas nor Fatah will agree to a peace settlement that ignores the Gaza Strip, so it's not like Israel can make peace in the West Bank as a model for the Gazans.  Furthermore, both Hamas and Fatah keep demanding a ""right of return"" for Palestinian ""refugees"" into Israel.  First of all, these refugees are the highly-multiplied descendants of the original Palestinians who fled areas taken by or allocated to Israel in 1948.  Second of all, the sheer number of them would overwhelm Israel's demographics and morph it into an Arab state.  This is the true goal of Hamas and Fatah in the peace process: to win a ""right of return"" and thereby ""liberate"" all of ""Palestine"" by guaranteeing themselves a Jew-free (until recently) State of Palestine with an Arab-majority *Dawlat Israil* (Arabic for ""State of Israel"").  Their leaders perceive this as a war of attrition in which they can eventually win enough pity from the world and have enough of a demographic advantage to overwhelm Israel in sheer numbers and support despite Israel's military advantage.

I'm not sure if they know or care that this approach is precisely what makes their economic situation so miserable.  If you ask a Palestinian or one of their Western supporters about it, I believe they call it ""democracy"".

The government offers some democratic elements, and those must be expanded so people have control over their own welfare. People should be voting every month. I don't mean we should have a majoritarian tyranny, that's not what democracy is.

The government at least has some accountability to the public. Insurance companies don't. The gov. needs much more accountability and democratic reform, but I think it'd do a better job. Name one thing any for-profit institution has touched in the past ten thousand years that hasn't been broken.""

If the government is the only system, and they suck, the people can't all go to another provider who has better service.

""Again, probably right, which is why we need democratic reform and more accountability, but have a sense of proportion. Insurance companies take 1/3 of every dollar for profit. The salaries of insurance executives are appallingly higher than government salaries. The US pays twice as much as Canada per person and more than twice as much as the main European countries and on average we have the worst system. If we paid what we do now, and adopted France's and the UK's system, both of which can be improved, not only would everyone be covered, but our system would be twice as good.

If you believe that will happen I have some ocean front property in Arizona I'll sell you for $100 an acre. All accountability means in government is another layer of bureaucracy so as to create more smoke and mirrors as to who actually screwed up.


""Most of this country favors progressive taxation and expanded welfare. Obama's election was largely a referendum on that. If the rich don't like it, they can stop benefiting from the labor of poor and the middle class. Almost every poll we can find shows that a majority of Americans support MediCare for all.""

With the exception of about half of reddit, I don't know a single person who favors more taxation and expanded welfare. I come from a blue collar community where everyone works. The people I know that voted for Obama did so because they were sick of the republicans, not because they liked Obama's ideas.

I agree with you that in a perfect society we would have single payer healthcare for all, rich and poor, and that the government would do an amazing job running it and it would be done fairly. But this is FAR from that and until then, the less government is involved, the better.

False,3,0,,"Here is the section missing from the Associated Press' transcript:

&gt; On the other hand, it is also undeniable that the Palestinian people -- Muslims and Christians -- have suffered in pursuit of a homeland.  For more than 60 years they've endured the pain of dislocation.  Many wait in refugee camps in the West Bank, Gaza, and neighboring lands for a life of peace and security that they have never been able to lead.  They endure the daily humiliations -- large and small -- that come with occupation.  So let there be no doubt:  The situation for the Palestinian people is intolerable.  And America will not turn our backs on the legitimate Palestinian aspiration for dignity, opportunity, and a state of their own.  (Applause.)

&gt; For decades then, there has been a stalemate:  two peoples with legitimate aspirations, each with a painful history that makes compromise elusive.  It's easy to point fingers -- for Palestinians to point to the displacement brought about by Israel's founding, and for Israelis to point to the constant hostility and attacks throughout its history from within its borders as well as beyond.  But if we see this conflict only from one side or the other, then we will be blind to the truth:  The only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met through two states, where Israelis and Palestinians each live in peace and security.  (Applause.)

&gt; That is in Israel's interest, Palestine's interest, America's interest, and the world's interest.  And that is why I intend to personally pursue this outcome with all the patience and dedication that the task requires.  (Applause.)  The obligations -- the obligations that the parties have agreed to under the road map are clear.  For peace to come, it is time for them -- and all of us -- to live up to our responsibilities.

&gt; Palestinians must abandon violence.  Resistance through violence and killing is wrong and it does not succeed.  For centuries, black people in America suffered the lash of the whip as slaves and the humiliation of segregation.  But it was not violence that won full and equal rights.  It was a peaceful and determined insistence upon the ideals at the center of America's founding.  This same story can be told by people from South Africa to South Asia; from Eastern Europe to Indonesia.  It's a story with a simple truth:  that violence is a dead end.  It is a sign neither of courage nor power to shoot rockets at sleeping children, or to blow up old women on a bus.  That's not how moral authority is claimed; that's how it is surrendered.

&gt; Now is the time for Palestinians to focus on what they can build.  The Palestinian Authority must develop its capacity to govern, with institutions that serve the needs of its people. Hamas does have support among some Palestinians, but they also have to recognize they have responsibilities.  To play a role in fulfilling Palestinian aspirations, to unify the Palestinian people, Hamas must put an end to violence, recognize past agreements, recognize Israel's right to exist.

&gt; At the same time, Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel's right to exist cannot be denied, neither can Palestine's.  The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements.  (Applause.)  This construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace.  It is time for these settlements to stop.  (Applause.)

&gt; And Israel must also live up to its obligation to ensure that Palestinians can live and work and develop their society.  Just as it devastates Palestinian families, the continuing humanitarian crisis in Gaza does not serve Israel's security; neither does the continuing lack of opportunity in the West Bank. Progress in the daily lives of the Palestinian people must be a critical part of a road to peace, and Israel must take concrete steps to enable such progress. 

&gt; And finally, the Arab states must recognize that the Arab Peace Initiative was an important beginning, but not the end of their responsibilities.  The Arab-Israeli conflict should no longer be used to distract the people of Arab nations from other problems.  Instead, it must be a cause for action to help the Palestinian people develop the institutions that will sustain their state, to recognize Israel's legitimacy, and to choose progress over a self-defeating focus on the past.

&gt; America will align our policies with those who pursue peace, and we will say in public what we say in private to Israelis and Palestinians and Arabs.  (Applause.)  We cannot impose peace.  But privately, many Muslims recognize that Israel will not go away.  Likewise, many Israelis recognize the need for a Palestinian state.  It is time for us to act on what everyone knows to be true.

&gt; Too many tears have been shed.  Too much blood has been shed.  All of us have a responsibility to work for the day when the mothers of Israelis and Palestinians can see their children grow up without fear; when the Holy Land of the three great faiths is the place of peace that God intended it to be; when Jerusalem is a secure and lasting home for Jews and Christians and Muslims, and a place for all of the children of Abraham to mingle peacefully together as in the story of Isra -- (applause) -- as in the story of Isra, when Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed, peace be upon them, joined in prayer.  (Applause.)

&gt; The third source of tension is our shared interest in the rights and responsibilities of nations on nuclear weapons.

&gt; This issue has been a source of tension between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran.  For many years, Iran has defined itself in part by its opposition to my country, and there is in fact a tumultuous history between us.  In the middle of the Cold War, the United States played a role in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government.  Since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has played a role in acts of hostage-taking and violence against U.S. troops and civilians.  This history is well known.  Rather than remain trapped in the past, I've made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward.  The question now is not what Iran is against, but rather what future it wants to build.

&gt; I recognize it will be hard to overcome decades of mistrust, but we will proceed with courage, rectitude, and resolve.  There will be many issues to discuss between our two countries, and we are willing to move forward without preconditions on the basis of mutual respect.  But it is clear to all concerned that when it comes to nuclear weapons, we have reached a decisive point.

False,1,0,,"the biggest misconception i think about SMD vs proportional representation systems is that lack of third parties are a problem that can be fixed.  

Think of it this way.  Every democratically elected government needs a coalition to pass legislation.  

It is fairly obvious in parliamentary systems like in the EU because different parties make official coalitions.  It happens in the US too.  When a group becomes popular enough one of the parties will adopt enough of their platform to attract enough supporters and gain an edge.

These third parties or ""fringe groups"" do effectively change the political parties and thus the government when their demands are popular enough to swing the advantage to the side that embraces them.

The only real difference here is that one system forms coalitions before an election, and the other after.

So, go ahead and join the pirate party or just advocate for their ideals.  If enough people do, a major party will make concessions to attract your vote.  Or if neither party does then the losing one will naturally become a third party and another more inclusive one will take over.

False,10,0,,"&gt; more on topic, I'm surprised that the Egyptian dialect of Arabic is so unique.

It's not, really. The Arabic Wikipedia is in Classical Arabic, which is a literal language that hasn't changed much for 1400 years. The vernacular languages of the modern Arabic world are all quite different, and quite different to each other, too.

Think of it as if all of Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands and England still used some variant of 7th century German in all written discourse. Or if Latin was still prevalent as a literary language in southern Europe. (OK, maybe a little less extreme than that, but don't underestimate a bilingual brain..)

&gt; he was telling me that basically any Arabic speaker could understand any other Arabic speaker, and even speakers of Farsi and Urdu, with little to no effort or confusion.

This quite simply isn't true.

There are a lot of Arabic loans in Persian and Urdu (and Pashto and Turkish, for that matter), but it's superficial. There are no grammatical similarities and the base vocabulary is all different. Also, sometimes the loans don't mean the exact same as in Arabic. 

And the pronunciation's quite different. The changes are mostly systematic (Arabic [x] -&gt; Turkish [h], (one variant of) Arabic [d] -&gt; Persian [z], etc.), but there's just no way at all an Arabic speaker with little or no previous experience of Persian or Turkish would be able to understand more than maybe one or two words out of a sentence in those, and most certainly nothing of the grammar.",True,1425982547,True,,t3_8qxmr,[deleted],10,t1_c0a5owd,,t5_2qhos,1244552025,linguistics,0,0,t1_c0a5quc,c0a5quc

&gt;I am very aware of the US's role in preventing conflict but that is the future, an international agreement that invasion will not tolerated.

And what if we become incapable or unwilling to provide that security? Certainly stationing troops in Europe is cheaper than helping to bail Europe out of WW3, but standing armies are expensive. Further, what if the European rhetoric of ""Stupid Americans, we've moved past power. Why can't you?"" actually takes hold?

False,-1,0,,"&gt;The U.S. tried to invade Canada once, and we failed. 

Ages ago. Are you prepared to discuss the impact of the Napoleonic wars in European history and the relevance it has to the security decisions of today?

&gt;The best answer I can muster for why the U.S. hasn't invaded Canada is because 1. We share so much culture that a U.S. controlled Canada would look a lot like a Canada controlled Canada, so it would be for naught. 2. The U.S. has preponderance in the region, and as such no other country poses a threat to us. If anything, Canada has security via its weakness. 3. We have clear cut borders, no disputed regions, and good economic ties (I'll admit they do matter, just not as much as you think).

Your first point is equivalent to goodwill, sorry. The second point is the only one of value: you clearly are dominant already. 

The main reason to invade Canada is also the best reason not to: consider that Nazi Germany never invaded Sweden. That decision had very little goodwill in it. Sweden, and its resources, were more valuable as a trading partner than as occupied territory susceptible to bombing campaigns.
So the main reason to not invade Canada is that the US, through trade, already has very good access to the resources of Canada, probably significantly better than it would have the first 20 years or so after an invasion.

The same goes for Europe: trading for resources instead of trying to conquer them by war. Also, it took French penalization, German revanchism and a madman to start WWII, after which the horrors of war was beat into the bones of the people of Europe in fashion that Americans cannot fathom (just as we Europeans cannot understand ""9/11 changed everything"").

Clearly, Europe without the US military canopy would have been very different, but western Europe would in all likelihood not have waged another war (clearly depending on the stability of democracy). The Balkan war would have been another story, as well as a likely war between Greece and Turkey.

I was actually just citing that fact to steal your thunder so that you couldn't try to raise it as a relevant issue. The U.S. did in fact invade Canada once, so it's not impossible, but I don't think it would happen today for the reasons listed. If the U.S. shrank significantly in power and Canada gained power such that the two were relatively similar in their power levels, I do believe the chance for war would go up significantly. All studies of international relations support this. Read some Frank Wayman, some Mearsheimer and some Morgenthau and get back to me. 

&gt;Your first point is equivalent to goodwill, sorry.

Not in the least. Good will and cultural similarity are quite different. If Germany took over France things there would look radically different. If the U.S. ran Canada today things would still be very much the same (save for the health care issue).

&gt;The main reason to invade Canada is also the best reason not to: consider that Nazi Germany never invaded Sweden. That decision had very little goodwill in it. Sweden, and its resources, were more valuable as a trading partner than as occupied territory susceptible to bombing campaigns. 

Germany didn't attack Sweden because they bolstered their defenses rapidly when they saw Finland come under attack, nearly doubling the army overnight. Germany saw that invading Sweden would be more of a thorn if attacked rather than just controlled with the threat of violence and a blockade via Denmark and Norway. Sweden was basically a puppet state of Germany for the course of the war. Germany would have invaded Sweden if doing so would have invaded Sweden if the benefits outweighed the consequences, but for them it did not. The fact that you think the Swedes were ""more valuable"" when they were making the Germans pay for iron than if they were simply taken over by Germany to produce it at even less cost to the war effort, you're nuts. Thanks for trying though. 

&gt;The same goes for Europe: trading for resources instead of trying to conquer them by war. Also, it took French penalization, German revanchism and a madman to start WWII, after which the horrors of war was beat into the bones of the people of Europe in fashion that Americans cannot fathom (just as we Europeans cannot understand ""9/11 changed everything"").

The United States won the war, but again I appreciate your attempt at revisionism. The USA suffered more military deaths than any country save for the USSR in WW2. We fully understand the horrors of the second World War.

False,4,0,,"No shit! I really would never have had any idea that Canada was colonised by the British Empire. None at all. Fuck, I thought we sing *God Save the Queen* at school just for shits and giggles.

&gt;That means that these countries were settled, exploited, or occupied by W.Europeans and Americans against their own wishes. These countries were forced into the global market to avoid sinking into pretty much the situation that is most of Africa and Latin America. Therefore, its citizens have a right to emigrate to the countries that first invaded their own homelands.

You're not being very coherent, nor factual. Korea and mainland China were never colonized (except by the Japanese and Han Chinese) and India was colonized for a relatively short period of time and quite frankly British rule did much to civilize the less palatable aspects of some of the cultures of that region (the Sati comes to mind) and to develop the country industrially. Atrocities were committed, but find me a single government that has not committed one.

Anyway, moving away from that digression, are you saying that colonization was wrong therefore the colonized have a right to colonize the colonizers? This is a perfect example of the *tu quoque* fallacy. 

You also seem far too focused on European colonization. Should the Phillipines, Chinese, and Koreans be allowed to immigrate in great numbers to China simply because the Japanese conquered these countries? Have you thought of the implications to Japanese culture or have they forefeited their right to have a culture simply because they altered the culture of others (as their own culture was altered in its formative period were influenced by Chinese and Korea culture)?

Indeed, if we follow your argument to its logical conclusion, we can see how the British Empire was totally justified simply because England was itself subject to colonization by not only the Normans, but also the Danes, the Anglo-Saxons, the Irish, etc.

Religion is one of the most effective tools for that though.  I only know of one other comparable tool and that is nationalism.

&gt; but I still stand by my statement that Christianity does more good than bad. 

Yet I've shown that in many it does not.  Your statement contradicts the omissions you have made about the evils carried out under christianity.

&gt;The modern missionary is very different than the colonists of years past.

Yet another omission about the evil carried out using christianity.

&gt;just because there are good non christians and evil people who claim to be christians does not mean that Christianity does not make people ""good"", whatever that means.

I think you know what it means, regardless of the phrasing.  My point was that if christianity made people good, there would not be so many evil christians, and it especially wouldn't be as effective a tool for evil.  It was said because of the naive way you see your religion, whilst realising the reality of religious evil that I point out.

&gt;One Christian organization I would encourage you to check out is called the Congo Initiative. They work in the DRC to provide education amongst many other things to try and help the nation rebuild itself.

Interestingly, christianity has been in the Congo for the hundreds of years.  The majority of the people there are christian.  Looks like they need something different, christianity hasn't helped them.  Their problems are political, this is easily ignored if the goal is to simply spread christianity.  Religion doesn't deal with the problem, they need security, law and order far more than yet more churches.  If countries needed christianity, much of Europe would be in a far worse state than the Congo.

&gt;I completely agree with you that there are many Christians who are focusing on the wrong things, but this does not deter my faith at all.

That is the problem with faith, those christians have faith that they're the ones doing the right christian thing.  Faith is obviously a very poor basis for determining such things.

&gt;I'm probably starting to sound like a broken record, but people who abuse others in the name of God are extremely misguided and wrong in their actions. 

But how do you know this, what makes you so sure that other christians, who use the bible as a reference, are wrong and you are right?

&gt;I do not believe that taking religion out of the equation would change people wanting to have power over others.

There are no reasons for denying people condoms except for religious ones.  The same goes for abuse against those accused of withcraft and demonic possession.  Removing religion won't make the world perfect, but it will remove one of the most damaging influences.  Imagine the middle east without religion, for just one very powerful example.  **There are very few things people will so readily spill blood and commit atrocities over than religion.**

&gt;They need Jesus Christ, not religion. I see no contradiction.

The two are inseparable.  I think you are trying to play semantics here.

&gt;The message is perfect, the messengers are not.

If the message were perfect, these things would not be easily justifiable using the message.  The message is evil, insane, contradictory and open to a wide variety of interpretations.  Your interpretation is just one.  It is clearly not perfect.

&gt;I don't think that Africa needs any kind of abuse-causing ideology. A cursory reading of the teachings of Jesus will reveal that any kind of abuse is wrong.

Let's try a cursory reading, hmm, there's something about not letting anyone suffer a witch, violent exorcism of a demonic possession, racism, eternal torture for unbelievers.  Not looking too good is it?  And that's not even touching on the psychotic first half of the bible.

&gt;Any person who calls themselves a Christian and proceeds to rape, torture, or kill is a hypocrite.

Even if it's in the name of converting them to christianity, ensuring that they avoid hell?  According to christianity, anything, even torture, would be better than letting someone die a heretic/witch and burn for eternity/side with the devil.  This is a reasoning which led to horrifying atrocities carried out by christians for hundreds of years.

&gt;It teaches that if you don't repent for your sins and ask for forgiveness from God that you do not get to spend eternity with Him; but that is not the point of being a Christian. That is pretty much the only requirement to being a Christian, the other stuff is what naturally follows. I can question anything I want.

Even question why we're born with sins, or why blood and sacrificing makes sin disappear, or how a god can be killed with a spear, or how jesus can be god and the son of god simultaneously?  There are some things christians can not question.  If you question the bible too much, you will end up losing your faith, something which leads to horrifying consequences according to christianity.

&gt;Make jobs less hard, not painful, not unpleasant and people will keep working till they are close to dying. And be happier and healthier as well.

I'm not really sure what your definitions are of hard, painful and unpleasant are.  My experience is that the change from person to person.  I don't want an easy job.  I watch my dad work in the Air Force for 22 years, being gone an average of 270 days a year and regularly working 12-20 hour days.  He thrived on it.  I *want* a hard, challenging job, and almost everyone I know wants one, too.  Unpleasantness varies from person to person.  I would hate to work in as a dentist, but I know people who want that as their career.  I guess there's always being a garbage man.  But then again, it has good pay and somebody's got to do it.

&gt;Train them so when they get older they will have sit down jobs. Let them work part time when they are older.

If that is at all possible, then I think it sounds like a great idea.  But I tend to think that it might not always be that simple.  Often the ""sit-down"" jobs at companies that require a lot of standing, are managerial positions.  Typically, those go to the most qualified, not the oldest workers.  Obviously that's not always the case, but you can't just make an older worker a manager or a secretary; it requires a certain skill set.

Working part time also sounds good, but this requires that companies hire more employees.  One worker who can work 10 hours a day is cheaper than two workers working 5 hours a day.  Where would this money come from?

&gt;You're conflating personal hatred with war. Most wars don't grow out of personal hatred, that follows. Most wars grow out of personal fear (and fear at the top ranks, if nothing else). The French still fear a resurgent Germany, which is why the EU exists at all.

Good point, but both fear Russia a lot more (OK, I'm biased, Swedes are indoctrinated to fear the Russians), and Russian culture, especially political culture, is very different from German or French which have grown similar over the years.

False,3,0,,"The only problem I really see is the fact that these institutions are depending way too much on representative democracy. I guess in a way that's understandable given the issues they're dealing with (intergovernmental ones) demand specialization and expertise, but I wouldn't really feel comfortable having a president of North America. The only reason the EU has been held back thus far is because actual citizens of some of these countries have voted down referendums authorizing power to the EU, so the politicians have no control. They have to convince the citizens to authorize it. That's how it should be done, but given there's no national referendum system in America, that's not really possible here, so I'm afraid it's just going to go forward without much input from us.

As far as world government goes, there's just so much to deal with; so much diversity. For the world government to not make policies that really harm people they'd have to concern themselves with really benign and inconsequential matters that can be implemented universally. 

Instead of just being military agreements that don't really hold up, are hard to coordinate, or may not be internationally-recognized, this would make things the same everywhere. It would make, say, the Canadian, Mexican, and United States military the same entity. Kinda tough when there's at least 3 languages used among us, but it's worse in the African Union and the European Union, of course. I'm talking about continental unions still, simply because it's hard to even imagine the dynamics of an actual world government. I don't really see there being a reason for a military under a world government, really, unless we're planning on fighting other worlds, that is. 

These unions are great for less economically prosperous nations. Can you imagine the border being essentially non-existent between Mexico and the United States? Things would change pretty dramatically. 

As I said, Jean-Jacques Rousseau (one of the fathers of democracy) postulated that the bigger the electorate, the more the government takes on a totalitarian nature. This is almost always the case. There's something like 4 billion people in Asia. Whatever they decided on would pretty much be the official policy. That's probably why these continental unions are being set up; they're more representative of the citizens living there. 

I don't know. I've been researching it a lot lately. It's kind of exciting to think things could be changing so radically. (Americans voting for members of parliament? That's kinda wonky.) Then again, I don't want excitement to take precedent over stone cold rationalism, which is called for when dealing with things such as this. 

I will say that the [Union of South American Nations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_South_American_Nations) is one that really excites me, particularly because there are a lot of leftists who have been instrumental in the process, such as Evo Morales and Hugo Chavez. I'm happy for them. It should be really good for them. It'll probably help lift a lot of people out of poverty. Che Guevara dreamed of a unified South America.

False,0,0,,"&gt;Ah, I think you have the assumption that Bible should be a clear source of instruction, like a textbook. That would certainly be nice, but it is not the case. Reading the Bible is more like interpreting a work of art. You might take away ideas not directly intended by the artist, and that is part of the experience.

There's clarity and then there's the bible, it is the direct opposite of clear.  It is shoulder to shoulder with insane, evil and confusing.  Reading the bible is like looking at a diary of a schizophrenic, high on acid.  Assigning completely different meanings to most of everything written in the bible is beyond a joke.

Imagine a republican politician happily murdering a baby on live tv and then a fox news ""reporter"" saying people have misinterpreted his intention, or don't understand politics.  That's the type of comical apologetics you've displayed here.  **This is the same nonsense as the emperor's new clothes**, the exact same thing.

&gt;You are free to discard the Bible and use pure human reason. 

I know of many who were forced to praise jesus and learn about the bible whilst growing up.  It's nothing short of brain washing.  Many are not free to discard it.

&gt;Christian teaching suggests that you do not need to have read that Bible to know God, for the name of God is ""written on the heart of every man.""

Christian teaching claims that not accepting jesus will mean you end up being tortured in hell for eternity.

&gt;Christian scholar Brian MacLaren writes: ""As in so many issues these days, the problem isn’t the Bible; it’s the assumptions we bring to the Bible about how it is supposed to be interpreted. 

But how do you know how it's to be interpreted, let alone how you know that messages in the bible actually mean the exact opposite on an arbitrary basis?  We come back to my point that it's an unnecessary and dangerous stumbling block towards [morality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality) and [ethics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics).

Fox news could be interpreted similarly, people could say there's great merit to watching it and trying hard to decipher the actual message, or what's really going on.  But you'd be far better off just turning to a real news medium.

&gt;We make demands of the Biblical writers that we don’t make of any other writers,

Really, is no other writer expected to make at least some sense, be at least somewhat coherent, to be at least a little sane?  Anyone writing something like the bible today would seriously have their sanity questioned.

If the bible is going to be used by people to affect society, politics and law as strongly as it does, then yes, it should at least make some sense.

&gt;and I’m not sure our demands are sensible or fair at all. As an analogy, I often refer to the Wizard of Oz in my teaching. Does this mean that I believe Dorothy was a historical figure? No. It means that I accept the story of Oz as being part of our culture, 

The bible is supposed to be a testament.  Everyone knows The Wizard of Oz is a fictional story, the same can not be said for the bible.  To my knowledge no one has used the story of Oz as a basis for committing atrocities.  If Dorothy murdered children, promoted racism, condemned characters to be tortured, etc, whilst heralded as a model person, an example to children, you can bet there'd have been an outcry.  No one would have said *that's a misinterpretation* and been taken seriously.

&gt;Certainly, the literary work of the Bible has had a tremendously destructive influence on history. But it has also had a positive influence, by encouraging the development of universities, hospitals, judicial systems, the practice of rhetoric and scholarship, charitable organizations and service.

It's negative impact outweighs the positive.  The early [universities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University#History) were developed far more by non-christians.  The reading of non-christian literature was opposed.  Libraries were burned to the ground throughout Europe.  Knowledge was lost, many books destroyed forever.  It was only during the advent of medical science (also opposed by christianity) that hospitals became useful.  It was possible during a revival of the values and teachings (saved by Arabs) of the ancient (pagan) Greeks.  Universities, our judicial system, [rhetoric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric#The_history_of_rhetoric_in_western_civilization) and scholarship owe far, far more to the work of ancient (pagan) Greeks, than they ever would to the bible.  Charity exists outside of christianity, ask yourself why some of the most charitable nations on the planet are very unreligious (e.g. Norway, Sweden, Japan).

Besides, christianity has a strong negative impact on academia, medical science and the judicial system today.

&gt;Even without a full accounting if the good and bad, tossing out the Bible as a whole seems to be hasty. Doing so only further divides evangelical believers from freethinkers.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""freethinkers,"" if you mean atheists in any way, then evangelical believers draw the division at not believing in jesus as god.  Anyone on the wrong side of their line are viewed in a very negative way.

What we need to do is not peddle nonsense like ""21st century Western morality, worldview and even law is heavily informed by scripture,"" when it isn't and it shouldn't be.

But the argument being mad ehere is for the nationalization of the insurance industry, which is thereby socialized medicine, which is also single payer. What is the difference between those three exactly?

&gt;In most cases where socialized medicine exists, this is coupled with an arrangement paying for the care through taxes and thus pooling costs as well. This is the European/Canadian/rest-of-the-world model, and statistically and financially speaking, it works.

I still ask:
 Why must everyone be forced to pay for the poor life decisions of everyone else? We don't nationalize any other form of insurance (car, house, boat), so why should we nationalize health insurance? You don't want to pay for anyone else's reckless driving, so why are you ok with paying for anyone else's reckless eating/smoking/drinking? 

&gt;Frankly, I would be thrilled even with single-payer, even if there was no socialization involved. 

Single payer IS a socialized system because the government takes the taxes from everyone and equally distributes the risk. That is the textbook definition of a socialist act. Precisely what kind of socialism do you speak of beyond the single payer socialism?

Land. Wealth. Honor. Or even more plainly, security. If the U.S. drops its protective shield and France starts to build up a real military (for the first time in 70 years) don't you think it might worry the Germans, since they would be totally vulnerable to a possible invasion? Thucydides said that the growth of power in Athens made the war between Athens and Sparta inevitable. Do you believe that Europe has moved past history? You flatter yourself. 

&gt;Do you seriously think they will sell more industrial technology (Siemens) or BMWs/Mercedes abroad at gun-point? Nope. I could see how a European continent under total German control would increase the prominence of Germany in the world, of course. This would take an exact repetition of the build-up to WWII, which will never happen (history doesn't repeat itself to that degree).

I think the Germans would be quite happy enough to get Alscae Lorraine back. It would increase the wealth of the country, their honor, and serve their views of the true nationality of that region. 

Do you not believe that a peaceful Germany in the 1930s would have sold more BMWs than violent Nazi Germany? Could they have not exported their tremendous rifles, foodstuffs, timber, etc? You must recognize that there are often more important things than economic growth to a nation full of humans. 

&gt;Sanctions, sanctions, sanctions. 

What do you know of sanctions? Can you find a single instance in the history of the world that sanctions have caused a war to end? Having studied the matter, I argue that you cannot. Sanctions are only ever effective when used in conjunction with violent war, in which case it is quite impossible to tell what effect the sanctions had at all. 

&gt;Japan and South Korea were never supposed to succeed at all according to that theory. The only thing they have in abandon is water.

My point is that tiny, resource lacking Japan is an economic and military powerhouse, yet England is a but a speck of its former self. France is a joke on the international stage.

Findings using a smaller geographic area census table as well as cancer registries showed 2%-5% lower survival rates (more in line with Germany and Italy, still much better than England).

I am a 22 year old, east european, depressed, pathetic, lazy shithead.

I try to change, i really do. 
Background: 3 years ago i was admitted in a CS college - i didn't really like programming, i was quite interested in computers and i thought that an engineering school is better anyway than a business school or liberal arts etc.
In the 2nd semester i got bored of college, felt i wasn't doing much with my life and i got a part time job. 

2 years later, here i am. 
I got a good, well-paid job. ""Sales technical specialist"" - some sort of a presales position, dealing a lot with datacenter infrastructure and middleware (oracle technologies, VMware etc). I get paid ~1200$/month (the medium salary around here is 300$), still working part time.
Still in college, 3rd year, quite bad results, hoping to graduate next year.

Altough things look good, most of the time i feel like the aforementioned pathetic,lazy shithead. 
My biggest trouble is school. After 3 years in college, now i really like what i'm studying, the problem is i can't dedicate as much time i want (because of the job) and i feel like i've lost too much information from the first two years. No matter how hard i try, i can't make the deadlines for homework and projects. Not that i don't have the time, i would if i were more organized, it's just that i can't work under pressure.

At work i make all kind of stupid mistakes because usually i'm to stressed out with school and i lack foresight - in actions,comments etc.

I can't quit my job because i need the sweet paycheck, i can't quit school because i need my degree and i now i'm starting to love CS (altough i feel it's too late and i should've been more passionate when i started going to college). 

I want to learn a new language (or practise my german), i want to program as a hobby, i want to read as many Pulitzer novels as i can, i want to get back in shape, i want to learn chess, i want to stop picking my nose i really want to make the most of me but most of the time i just find myself browsing reddit or starting another game of freecell.

I just can't change my mold. I've tried - that's what i got a job in college, that's why i broke up with my hippie ex-girlfriend and got together with my current older bossy gf, that's why i bought myself a new car, that's why i'm writing this whining, full-of-nothing and sense-lacking post.

&gt; ""The notorious AK-47 can be assembled from a kit of roughly-machined parts using only hand tools.  Gun prohibition then is not the same as banning DDT or leaded gasoline.  It is more like banning fire.""

Of course, that's not much of a factor when dealing with the criminal element in a society that has banned firearms.  Violent criminals are, in general, lazy.  They would rather get away with something than work for it.  As a result, they're usually very unlikely to manufacture their own firearms; leave that to guerillas fighting stronger forces with more advanced weaponry.

Violent criminals in a disarmed society *already* have an advantage, even without guns.  Actually, they have an advantage *especially* without guns, because they typically choose the time and place of their violent criminal acts, and select their victims based on defenselessness.  When the victim cannot legally carry a concealed firearm, those selections of victims based on apparent defenselessness are far more likely to be accurate.

&gt; I'm not worried about being attacked by someone carrying a gun.

I'm not worried about that in the US, either.  I'm more worried about getting attacked by someone (or a group of people) armed with close contact weapons like knives and baseball bats, because such attacks are more likely.  The last couple murders or attempted murders in this town about which I remember any details were, in fact, committed with a baseball bat and a knife, respectively.  I'm less worried about such instances than I might be, though, because I have a concealed carry permit.

&gt; I don't think other people are worried about that either and that's probably why most Europeans think gun control is a good thing whereas Americans think the opposite.

I suspect a culturally ingrained fear of firearms is part of the problem, too.  I find that, once taken to the range to do some shooting a few times, people who previously tolerated stronger gun control stances in politicians begin to revise their views on the matter.

It's relatively simple.  

* Logos:  Whenever the market system is not arbitrarily limited by government agencies, it is the *single most effective* method of distribution of scarce resources.

* Ethos: People deserve to be free to make their own choices.  If Jimmy the Cancer patient wants to try the Vitamin C therapy, or some other cutting-edge therapy not yet approved by the government, it shouldn't be inaccessible to him; nor should he have to pay for a service he cannot use.  With socialized medicine comes the unitary government standard of what qualifies **as** medicine.  Say goodbye naturopaths, et al.

* Pathos: Can you **really** trust the *government* to be the agency that will most look out for you, as opposed to yourself?  They've obviously done a **SWIMMINGLY** good job with the whole ""You can only be covered if you're employed"" thing.  Could you imagine if hospitals were administrated by the equivalent of the DMV?  

&gt; Health care to some of us, isn't a product to be bought. It should be a luxury of the advancement of the human race.

Health care is a scarce resource. There's only so much to go around -- and it **costs money to be produced**.  Now, there *ARE* ways to reduce that cost.

*MS: You're missing the point. The people who use IE are going to get it preinstalled from the factory. Those who don't will either opt out of installing IE, or get it preinstalled so they have a browser that they can use to download another browser.

*EU: Still not quite following...

*MS: Of course you don't. 

**PC Tech enters*

*Tech: EU, what the fuck is this?

*EU: We're getting people to switch to other browsers! Freeing them from the oppressive grasp of an evil corporation

*Tech and MS: No, you arent.

*EU: What?

*Tech: Listen, the vast majority of Windows users don't give a shit about their browser. All they care about is getting on eBay, MySpace, Facebook, and checking their email. They're in their own little meticulously constructed Microsoft operating/eco-system.

*MS: Damn straight!

*Tech: Stfu.

*EU: But that's the point, we're freeing them!

*Tech: You don't get it. They're perfectly happy using IE, and Microsoft Office, and Windows. If they lose their little blue ""e"" it confuses and frightens them. Their computer use is so limited they can't tell the difference, and more importantly, they don't want to know the difference.

*EU: But...

*OEM: *Reenters* You know, he's right. We'll probably be installing IE on all our machines unless the customer specifically opts out.

*EU: Wait, why?!

*OEM: Because every user who buys a computer from us will want to access the Internet. There's no reason for us not to do it.

*EU: But... anti-competitive practices!

*OEM: Fuck you and your ""anti-competitive practices"" bullshit. Anti-Trust was created to stop huge companies from actively trying to dominate their market.

*MS: Like we need to try any more. Have you seen Vista? We don't try for shit. If we were trying we'd be pushing updates for IE, instead of having 3 distinctly different versions of one product on the market at the same time. I mean, lets be honest. We're fucking retarded.

*OEM: True that. Selling an OS today is like selling a car without brakes, completely impractical. Everyone is going to want to get on the internet/drive their new car, even if it is only to download new browser/drive to their mechanic to get new brakes installed. People have always had the option of getting a new browser/brakes, whether they knew it or not. If they didn't then their stock browser/brakes are fine for them, there's no reason to inconvenience them. If they upgraded their browser/brakes previously it's just an annoyance to them, since they have to download a copy of Firefox/Opera/Chrome /get their car towed to the mechanic to get something they shouldn't have to jump through hoops to get.

*EU: So, what you're saying is that we haven't really done anything productive, and just made peoples' lives more difficult.

*OEM, Tech, MS: Yeah.

*MS: Especially ours. Dick.

The link I provided comes from the book ""God's Crucible: Islam and the Making of Europe, 570-1215,"" by Prof. David Levering Lewis at New York University (2008). I decided to check another credible source to confirm what Prof. Lewis wrote, so I read, ""The Rise and Fall of Alexandria,"" by Justin Pollard &amp; Howard Reid (2006).

According to that book, the contents of the famous library - which were stored in the Serapeum, a temple/college/library - were destroyed in 391 because, ""for the most radical elements among Alexandria's Christians, the books in the Serapeum were a threat. So they simply destroyed them.""

In reference to the legend that Muslims burned the books from the library in Alexandria's bath houses in the 7th century, the authors say this ""is almost certainly fictional.""  However, they also state that ""Roman emperors, Christian patriarchs, and Muslim caliphs had all ... whittled away at the library."" Therefore, it does seem that the Arab conquerors did contribute their part to library's ultimate demise.  

The purpose for posting the link in the first place was to highlight the fact that it is wrong to lay the blame for the library's destruction at the feet of the Arab conquerors. I will now amend that to: ""solely at the feet of the Arab conquerors."" The legend about the Muslims wiping out its contents was created by the Christian historian Bar-Hebraeus in a deliberate ploy ""to characterize the Muslim world as barbaric and backward.""

You are right that Diamond looks at broad trends in human history.  The problem with broad trends is that they are not applicable to every place and time.  You lose variation in human adaptability, which when trying to understand human history really obscures our understanding of agency and creativity.  There are far more exceptions to the rule than Diamond acknowledged.

My research focus is human infectious disease so I can only really speak with a tiny measure of insight on that topic.  

Diamond greatly generalized the debate on the origins of infectious disease and the influence of disease on subsequent human history (including colonization).

You can be brief and say that China doesn't need to buy our treasuries. That they would be better off in the long run not pegging their currency to ours anymore. China doesn't need to export to the degree they do. It's simply unnecessary and I *have* heard you say it. They can easily switch to domestic consumption of their goods and services.

I wonder if you agree that there are a couple of reasons China doesn't do this. First, there's a painful transition in the short run from an exporter to a consumer state. That can cause sort periods of dissatisfaction as a lot of people would lose jobs in the export sectors. China worries about that for obvious reasons other nations don't. That will surely become less of an issue as they become more market-oriented and free. Secondly, the export sector is a crony capitalist bastardization of markets and the People's Party doesn't want to hurt their friends/cousins/brothers. That's changing too though and everyone knows it. They crack down and arrest more and more on things like lead and frauds.

Boycotting Opera or Firefox or Chrome would be silly. And, although they may be supporters of the EU and its decisions, Opera and the others are in no position to force anything on MS. They just let the EU know that MS *might* be abusing its monopoly. The EU themselves decided to investigate and decided to take action (although no action has really been taken yet).

No one is looking to force bundling. Firefox, Opera, Safari and Chrome development moves too fast for that (although automatic updates might solve that). They just want the newbie computer user that doesn't already have a browser preference to know they have a choice and to be able to choose right off the bat the browser they want to try (by *automatically* fetching the latest installer and installing *for example* when they choose).

With the way it is now, new computer users that don't know they have a choice will just use IE. By the time (could be months or even years) they know there are other choices, they may be too used to IE to be able to mentally give anything else a chance. At least if they have a choice right off the bat, the browser they stick to will be somewhat random instead of always being IE. And, if they hate the one they pick, they'll know there are others to try.

People hate change and if MS doesn't provide some type of fair solution for browser vendors (including MS itself for IE) to hook a new user right off the bat, then IE gets most of the advantages. Whether that's anything to bitch about though is not for me to say.

With that said though, relying on MS to come up with some solution is probably a waste. There should be Chrome, Opera, Firefox and Safari commercials (and even IE commercials) all over the place. That'll spread the knowledge of choice.

They are separate issues. Most companies are probably subject to various laws and regulations and rulings that they don't care about or disagree with.

Adam Smith among others argue that monetary price, which is value in term of metallic coins cannot be objective/scientific measure of value. Instead he argue that value of good in exchange, that is how much an appple is worth in term of other goods like orange, for example, would be the objective measure. He further asserted that such value in exchange would be determined by the amount of labour time expended on production of each goods

It was also noted by all contemporaries during the industrial revolution that rate of profit tend to go down in more established industry with higher capital investment. Marx endeavoured to find the explanation for decreasing rate of profit within the framework of labour theory of value. 

""Simplified"" explanation of Marx goes like this. Surplus value is labour time expended in production minus labour time embedded in wage goods (foods, metalic coins etc), i.e. output - input = surplus. Since rate of profit equals surplus value divided by total capital, then it logically follow that increased investment must result in decreased rate of profit. 

Then, it follow that, when an economy as a whole accumulate capital, the rate of profit in totality must also fall. Capitalist then must reduce wage or worsen working condition to maintain rate of profit. As the condition of working class worsen to slavery, the revolution of working class become inevitable. 

There is a problem in above exposition. Tools and machinery also has embedded value of labour and these value must be embedded into next production process to get the surplus value in totality. The draft of Das Kapital shows that Marx tried to tackle this problem without producing a solution. So the whole premise of Das Kapital is based on incomplete assertion.

False,0,0,,"&gt;Palestinian leaders voiced their opposition, especially to the Israeli premier's flat rejection of any right of return for refugees...

I was going to place the following in the Palestine Subreddit, but that place seems dead.  I transcribed an excerpt from Roald Dahl's (author of *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*, *The BFG*) second-half of his autobiography, *Going Solo*, when he is in Palestine during WWII.  I apologize in advance for any errors I have made.  The bearded man's speech is transcribed correctly.  So it follows:

One morning at Haifa, the squadron leader called me aside, and told me that a small satellite landing field had been prepared about 30 miles inland behind Mount Carmel, from which the squadron could operate should our aerodrome at Haifa be bombed out.  

""I want you to fly over there and have a look at it,"" the squadron leader said.  ""Don't land unless it seems safe; and if you do land, I want to know what it's like.  It's meant to serve as a small, secret hideaway where those Ju-88's could never find us.""

I flew off alone, and in 10 minutes I spotted a ribbon of dry earth that had been rolled out in the middle of a large field of sweet corn.  On one side was a plantation of fig trees, and I could see several wooden huts among the trees.  I made a landing, pulled up, and switched off the engine.  Suddenly from out of the fig trees, and out of the huts, burst a stream of children.  They surrounded my Hurricane, jumping about with excitement, and shouting, and laughing, and pointing.  There must have been 40 or 50 of them altogether.  Then out came a tall, bearded man, who strode among the children and ordered them to stand away from the plane.  I climbed out of the cockpit, and the man came forward and shook my hand.  

""Welcome to our little settlement,"" he said, speaking with a strong German accent.  I'd seen enough English-speaking Germans in Dar es Salaam to know the accent well, and now quite naturally anyone who had anything even remotely Germanic about him sent alarm bells ringing in my head.  What's more, this place, according to the squadron leader, was meant to be secret.  And here I was being met by a welcoming committee of 50 screaming children and a huge man with a black beard, who looked like the Prophet Isaiah, and spoke like a parody of Hitler.  I began to wonder whether I'd come to the right spot.  

""I didn't think anyone knew about this,"" I said to the bearded man.  The man smiled.  ""We cut down the corn ourselves and helped to roll out the strip,"" he said.  ""This is our cornfield.""
""But, who are you?  And who are all these children?""  I asked him.
""We are Jewish refugees,"" he said.  ""The children are all orphans.  This is our home.""  The man's eyes were startlingly bright.  The black pupil in the center of each of them, seemed larger and blacker and brighter than any I'd ever seen, and the iris surrounding each pupil was brilliant blue.  

In their excitement at seeing a real, live fighter plane, the children were beginning to press right up against the aircraft, reaching out and making the elevators in the tailplane move up and down.  ""No, no!"" I cried out, ""Please, don't do that; please keep away, you could damage it!""  The man spoke sharply to the children in German and they all fell back.

""Refugees from where?"" I asked him.  ""And how did you get here?""
""Would you like a cup of coffee?"" he said.  ""Let's go into my hut.""  He picked out three of the older boys and set them to guard the Hurricane.
""Your plane will be quite safe now,"" he said.

I followed him into a small, wooden hut standing among fig trees.  There was a dark-haired young woman inside, and the man spoke to her in German, but he didn't introduce me.  The woman poured some water from a bucket into a saucepan, and lit a paraffin burner and proceeded to heat water for coffee.  The man and I sat down on stools at a plain table.  It was a loaf of what looked like home-baked bread on the table, and a knife.  

""You seem surprised to find us here,"" the man said.  
""I am,"" I said.  ""I wasn't expecting to find anyone.""
""We are everywhere,"" the man said.  ""We are all over the country.""
""Forgive me,"" I said, ""but I don't understand; who do you mean by 'we'?""
""Jewish refugees!""

I really didn't know what he was talking about.  I'd been living in East Africa for the past two years, and in those times the British colonies were parochial and isolated.  The local newspaper, which was all we got to read, hadn't mentioned anything about Hitler's persecution of the Jews in 1938 or 1939.  Nor did I have the faintest idea that the greatest murder in the history of the world was actually taking place in Germany at that moment.  

""Is this your land?"" I asked him.
""Not yet,"" he said.
""You mean you're hoping to buy it?""
He looked at me in silence for a while, then he said, ""The land is at present owned by a Palestinian farmer, but he has given us permission to live here.  He's also allowed us some fields so that we can grow our own food.""
""So, where do you go from here?"" I asked him.  ""You and all your orphans.""
""We don't go anywhere,"" he said, smiling through his black beard.  ""We stay here.""
""Then you will all become Palestinians,"" I said.  ""Or perhaps you are that already.""  

He smiled again, presumably at the naivety of my questions.  ""No,"" the man said.  ""I don't think we will become Palestinians.""  
""Then what will you do?""
""You are young man who's flying aeroplanes,"" he said.  ""And I don't expect you to understand our problems.""
""What problems?"" I asked him.  The young woman put two mugs of coffee on the table, as well as a tin of condensed milk that had two holes punctured in the top.  The man dripped some milk from the tin into my mug, and stirred it for me with the only spoon.  He did the same for his own coffee and then took a sip.

""You have a country to live in and it is called England,"" he said.  ""Therefore you have no problems.""
""No problems!"" I cried.  ""England is fighting for her life all by herself against virtually the whole of Europe!  We're even fighting the Vichy French, and that's why were in Palestine right now.  Oh we've got problems all right.""  

I was getting rather worked up.  I resented the fact that this man, sitting in his fig grove, said that I had no problems when I was getting shot at everyday.  ""I've got problems myself,"" I said, ""in just trying to stay alive.""
""That is a very small problem,"" the man said.  ""Ours is much bigger.""",True,1425984881,False,,t3_8shtp,G325C9,0,t3_8shtp,,t5_2qh13,1245030278,worldnews,0,0,t1_c0aajm0,c0aajm0

As someone that's been in 3 different European schools, in 2
countries, both private and public, and in Canadian schools; I can
tell you the differences are enormous. It's not just the schedule,
that's a very shallow sort of difference, and is fairly irrelevant.

The rigour of everything is much lower, and from what I hear/see
Canadian schools are better than their American counterparts. The pace
is incredibly slow. For example, we were doing geometric proofs in
grade 4 with triangles that friends in 1st year math couldn't do,
simply because they'd been failed so badly by their education
system. I did more chemistry and physics in grade 6 than I did in all
of high school in Canada. There's also social promotion, which is an
insane concept. Ever year in the European schools that I went to there
were people that simply failed because they tried but couldn't hack
it. Here if you have a pulse, you're almost certain to pass. What
needs to happen is teachers have to send a message that they're not
going to pass people that slack off; but there's no willingness to do
that. There's also the safety factor, I know teachers that passed
students because they were threatened with physical violence
otherwise, and the police wouldn't intervene; this happened both in
Canada and in the US.

Parents complain about homework because their children do, and vice
versa, it's a vicious cycle. The truth is homework is essentially
non-existent, once I got to Canada I basically spent no time doing
homework; the light load combined with the incredible ease made it
trivial. And I went to a well-above average school that was known for
turning out good math students to top universities and ranked highly
in academic competitions (like chess, math contents, trivia contests,
etc)

Students pride themselves on never having read a book. And even if
they did try to read, the education system is so bad that by grade 9
they don't have the reading skills to pick up a random book and plow
through it. I was mortified when on my first day in a Canadian school
the English teacher asked people in the class to read a passage out
loud each, 5-6 out of 30 could read at the pace that was required in
grade 3 in a European school. They also insult teachers in ways that I
still find shocking. I won't even start on the cheating, which spills
over in insane quantities into universities.

Every summer in the European schools we were given a list of a few
dozen books and had to read almost a dozen from it. And yes, we were
quizzed and given marks on this when we got back. We were also given a
list of math problems from workbooks to solve, at first; approaching
grade 5 they just started to assign entire 200 page workbooks for a
summer, with ~10-ish problems per page. We also got homework like this
for almost every break, including Christmas.

Perhaps my view of European schools isn't fair, I went to rather
select schools that had entrance exams all the way from grade one. But
I've seen how friends in other schools fared, school in North America
feels like kindergarten; we took grade 1 more seriously than people
take grade 12 here.

I could go on, there are plenty of other problems. But I hope this
will help convince anyone that the whole counting hours thing is
silly. Sure, it's nice, and something politicians can easily
measure. The problems run far deeper than that though, and adding more
hours of incredibly poor education, incredibly lax standards, with
incredibly poor teachers that generally don't care, and students that
are given no motivation to actually do the work, is simply going to lead nowhere.",True,1425984939,True,,t3_8sho0,teval,12,t1_c0aalmw,,t5_2qh1s,1245042404,Economics,0,0,t1_c0aanyc,c0aanyc

In the late 19th century, the first settlements were called bairros africanos (African neighborhoods), and they were the place where former slaves with no land ownership and no options for work lived. Over the years, many freed black slaves moved in. However, long before the first settlement called ""favela"" came into being, poor blacks were pushed away from downtown into the far suburbs. Most modern favelas appeared in the 1970s, due to rural exodus, when many people left rural areas of Brazil and moved to cities. Without finding a place to live, many people ended up in a favela.

&gt; I would be really curious to hear which countries and which

European countries are Cyprus and Romania, and then I moved to

club, etc, I got to visit a bunch of schools.

&gt; now live in Germany, and I'm not at all impressed by the education
system here. The day is very short (not mentioned in Economist
article, but 1pm is typical!)

School was done around 3-ish in all three countries, can't remember
the time exactly though.

&gt; and they seem to try to make up for this with homework -- piling it
on starting in the first grade, which I find counter-productive.

I think homework is good, or rather, well chosen homework is
good. They piled it on since grade 1, but it built competence and
confidence that you know what you're doing; as well as that feeling
that you might be missing something.

&gt; I find your claim that reading levels of a Grade 3 ""European"" school
are on par with a Grade 9 Canadian school just ludicrous, and the Pisa
study would seem to back me up.

Well, what I can say is that in grade 3 we could read out loud and
comprehend what is going on. This was not true of grade 9 in
Ontario. It was recognized to be so incredibly bad that they
introduced a standardized tests that a large percentage of people
failed. This is a trivial test that involves reading small, simple
paragraphs, and writing down what happened. The skills to do this were
definitely available in grade 3, and I could not imagine any of my
peers passing on without them.

year-olds. Not a single European country other than Finland
out-performed Canada)

That's nice. I have no faith in these tests, as they contradict what I
have seen and what almost everyone will tell you. The real problem is
that they compare randomly chosen schools. I'll agree entirely that if
you compare two random schools, one from Canada and one from Cyprus
the Canadian one will be better. But who cares about random schools?
They're for people who don't care about their children. If you compare
two decent schools, say one of the top few schools in a metropolitan
area; you get the above results with some regularity.

&gt; In any case, while I regret you had such a poor experience in Canada
(were you older than your peers?)

Younger by 1 year, skipped a grade. Meh, it wasn't poor. It was

Absolutely.

&gt;That's just neocon propaganda. 

No, that's history. 

&gt;The Soviets were never a real threat to the US

Define threat. They threatened to invade Europe and take over more land by force, they threatened to push into South America, into East Asia, and into the Middle East. We stopped them at every turn, and eventually their poorly designed economy caught up with them. History would look quite different had the U.S. not balanced Soviet force around the globe.

I think it's ironic that the author of this article is saying the American system will collapse and linking to economists websites with proof, when the real economists are saying nothing of the sort. Here is a link to Michael Hudson's website that was linked in the article.

Every person needs to read this entire interview.
http://www.michael-hudson.com/interviews/0902TaxProgramRecoveryItulip.html

http://www.michael-hudson.com/

Make sure to take note about the different sectors of our economy, and which ones are affected by this. The entire American economy is not going under, just parts of it. We will need to adapt to a global system of living below our means which is what other countries have been doing for a while. In a sense, it will be the death of the ""American lifestyle"" but one in which the majority of Americans were not living any way. Really only the top 10% were enjoying all of the true careless spending. Now, everyone will not be able to drive an SUV and have 3 flat screen tvs in their 5 bedroom house, but we dont need that. This is about changing to a suitable lifestyle that many, like me, already live.

This is a situation that can be fixed, and it eventually will. It just is a matter of how we go about it. One way or another the system will work out it's kinks, or the leaders will have to start drastic action, not unlike in the great depression, with writing down debt and who can pay it.

The best situation you can be in right now is to PAY OFF ALL YOUR DEBT. There are people to help you do this like Dave Ramsey which is one of the more popular ones off the bat. 

Seriously, go read the Michael Hudson website, it even explains the similarities with the system we use now and what happened to Rome when it collapsed and forced a GLOBAL dark ages.

Fortunately for us, we are smarter and know how to solve problems like this, see Japan, for worst case scenarios. That is what technology and the gradual improvement of civilization is about. Some people will fall on hard times if they had bitten more debt off than they could chew, but there are solutions that will eventually be put into place without everyone going ape shit ballistic with global conflict. 

Go look into it yourselves, don't live above your means and get out of debt fast.

Oh ye of great morals, why doth you shower me with your undeserved attention? Get down from your high horse. If you're anti-Soviet containment then you are pro violent, unpopular Soviet coups in those states, and further also blameworthy for all of the political killings and state created suffering that grows out of it. There was a very plain divide between the West and the USSR, and it was in the middle of Berlin. Many died trying to sneak out of East Germany, and precious few the other way around. 

&gt;The Soviet empire was a house of cards that was that was destined to fall apart.

See
&gt;1 Evidently you weren't around during the 50s, 60s, 70s, or 80s. Soviet power was still QUITE real at that point.
&gt;2 Even if Soviet power was destined to crumble, their 3 to 5 million man army would do quite a bit of damage in the meantime.

&gt;This was apparent to the he intelligence services and your politicians very early on until your political institutions and corridors of power got hijacked by the neocons seeking to create a grand national purpose and mythology.

The policy of Soviet containment was in place from the earliest days of the Cold War. What revisionist history book did you read such lies in?

&gt;Further as I have mentioned, many of the purported connections to soviet connections to the democratically elected governments like in Iran and Guatemala were deliberately fabricated for pure economic gain.

As regards Iran, I agree that the entire situation was manufactured, but it's hardly as simple as you seem to be making it. Mossadeq tried to nationalize the oil industry, pissing off the Brits, who sought to overthrow him but found themselves incapable. Thus they thus turned to the U.S., feeding them lies that Mossadeq was beginning to court the Soviets (which seemed plausible given his seemingly socialist oil nationalization policy), and with no options other than letting Britain ruin Iran financially or overthrowing Mossadeq, the U.S. agreed to help overthrow him.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Mosaddeq#Overthrow_of_Mosaddeq

That's hardly a cut and clean ""The U.S. is an evil imperialist giant!"" story you seem to want it to be. Most of the blame falls into the lap of the British. 

&gt;Ok I'll elbaorate. A mortal threat. The soviets were never a mortal threat. First there was the risk of MAD and secondly the Soviet system was completely inviable and the clock was ticking. The US intelligence services knew this very early on.

This is a fundamental misunderstanding of Cold War politics. While the U.S. and the USSR never fought a direct hot war, they did fight many proxy wars. What exactly do you think happened in Iran/Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, Korea, etc? War was a very real part of the 1945-1992 world, and the possibility of the Soviets rolling over Europe was all too real to people in those countries. Rest assured that the massive Red Army was not simply a peaceable defense force created to match the dastardly U.S. forces. Your political leanings seem to be clouding your understanding of history.

Saying that someone is from Russia straight away is simply taking it a step further and jumping over the ""he's no local"" thing. It's not necessarily for the better either. Let me give you an example as to why.

If you've been to Germany in the past fifteen years or so, you'd quickly notice that there's a large number of emigrants from ex-Soviet states. These people can be split into roughly three groups: those who immigrated after they've found a job there (Germany), those who have Jewish ancestry and, being last and the largest group, those who have German ancestry (the so-called Auswanderer). Without playing with prejudice, you can generally speaking say that the first group consists of very well educated individuals, the second isn't exactly large and the third, having moved in from the lesser developed regions (such as the Caucasus and Siberia), aren't exactly your everyday PhD-wielding physicists (once again, we're talking about the average individual, not every single member of the group). As is common among the poorer layers of society, this last isolated group is somewhat of a problem since they're neither doing a good job at integrating, nor at respecting the law (compared to other groups). The result of this is that the word ""Russian"", or as Germans say it ""Russe"", isn't even nearly as neutral as simply saying that you're a foreigner.

False,-1,0,,"&gt; **Almost complete elimination of invasive penile cancer.**

Firstly, penile cancer occurs in *old men* and at an extremely
small incidence. The National Cancer Institute of the U.S. expected a 2008 incidence of 1250 cases. For the U.S., that's rougly:

1250 / [147,129,583](http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/STTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=01000US&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_S0101&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2007_3YR_G00_) * 100% = 0.00085% or 85 in 100,000.

According to [Wikipedia (and the sources listed there)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penile_cancer):

&gt; Penile cancer is very rare in Europe and North America, occurring in about one in 100,000 men in the latter. It accounts for 0.2% of cancers and 0.1% of deaths from cancer amongst males in the United States.""

Quoting the [CIRP Library's page on penile cancer](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/):

In 1993, Christopher Maden, Ph.D., et al. reported a study[\[29\]](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/maden/) in which 110 men with penile cancer, diagnosed from January 1979, to July, 1990, were interviewed. Of these 110 men, 22 had been circumcised at birth, 19 later in life, and 69 never. The majority of the men interviewed were intact, 37% were circumcised, and 20% had been circumcised as infants. In circumcised men, the cancer usually occurs along the line of the circumcision scar. Finland, where circumcision is extremely rare, has a low incidence of penile cancer.[\[48\]](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/maiche1/)

To paraphrase Dr. George Denniston: Cancer of the penis is very rare, with a lifetime risk of between 1/600 and 1/1300. It strikes mostly older men. Even if circumcision could prevent it completely (which it does not), about a thousand foreskin amputations would be necessary to prevent one cancer of the penis.

In its 1996 [Statement](http://www.cps.ca/english/statements/FN/fn96-01.htm), the Canadian Paediatric Society noted:

&gt; Cadman, Gafni and McNamee... calculated that the cost of circumcising 100,000 male infants is $3.8 million and that this maneuver would prevent only two cases of cancer of the penis. ... they estimated that the cost of prevention would be 100 times the cost of treatment.

[Gellis](http://www.cirp.org/library/general/gellis1/) (1978) said there are more deaths from circumcision than from cancer of the penis.

In *Circumcision: An American Health Fallacy*, Edward Wallerstein writes[\[14\]](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/#n14): ""If infant circumcision reduces penile cancer we could expect to see proportionately less penile cancer in circumcising nations as compared to noncircumcising ones. No such difference is found."" Wallerstein reports that, for various years between 1966 and 1972, the annual rate of new cases of penile cancer was 0.8 for the United States (which circumcises), and 0.5 for Finland, 0.9 for Denmark and 1.1 for both Norway and Sweden (all of which do not). None of these differences is statistically significant. Further, within the same time frame, both France and the United States had the same rate, 0.3, of deaths due to penile cancer.[\[12\]](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/#n12)

In February 1996, representatives of the American Cancer Society stated in a [letter](http://www.cirp.org/library/statements/letters/1996-02_ACS/) to the American Academy of Pediatrics:

&gt; The American Cancer Society does not consider routine circumcision to be a valid or effective measure to prevent such [genital] cancers. Research suggesting a pattern in the circumcision status of partners of women with cervical cancer is methodologically flawed, outdated and has not been taken seriously in the medical community for decades.""

It is now pretty well understood that HPV (genital warts) is the cause of penile cancer. The link between the presence of human papillovirus (HPV) and genital cancer was established in the 1980s.[\[15\]](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/#n15),[\[17\]](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/#n17),[\[18\]](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/mccance/),[\[19\]](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/villa1/),[\[20\]](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/#n20),[\[21\]](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/barrasso/) [Hellberg et al.](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/hellberg1/) (1986) identified tobacco use as another risk factor for cancer of the penis. [Poland](http://www.cirp.org/library/general/poland/) identified the human papilloma virus (HPV) types 16 and 18 as the cause of penile and cervical cancers in 1990. Cervical cancer has epidemiologic similarities to venereal disease. The human papilloma virus is spread by sexual contact.[\[29\]](http://www.cirp.org/library/general/poland/).

But does circumcision help prevent infection by HPV? [According to this](http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/menshealth/facts/circumcision.htm):

&gt;  Circumcised men are more at risk from penile warts *[HPV]* than uncircumcised men, and the risk of developing penile cancer is now almost equal in the two groups. Therefore, routine circumcision cannot be recommended to prevent penile cancer.

You are paying for the ability to participate in that economy.

&gt;I don't want to ""benefit"" from these ""services"".

No you don't. You want to enjoy the benefits of living in a modern nation without paying for it.

Get your party elected. Until that time, you are consenting to the existing tax regime by remaining.

&gt;Because I shouldn't have to leave. I am not the aggressor.

To the legally constituted government of the ""Constitutional Republic"" you are consenting to reside in.

&gt;Nope. I won't leave because I am not the aggressor.

If someone comes in your  house every day and steals from you, and you cannot fight back, then you would be stupid not to flee. 

By remaining, you are choosing to allow this to happen.

By your actions, you show you don't think taxes are *actually* theft. You grumble and pay them, instead of really doing something meaningful about it.

You agree by staying. You are consenting to abide by the laws of the nation you're in.

&gt;I am telling you I do not agree.

Then leave.

&gt;You don't have logic or consistency on your side.

It's perfectly logical. If you accept the legitimacy of the USA as a nation-state, then you accept its laws, and in turn, taxation. If you do not accept the legitimacy of the US, then you are a hostile enemy force occupying Native American territory that was wrongfully taken from them, and you should return to Europe or wherever your forebears came from.

Unless you are actually a full-blooded Native American, in which case you might have cause to object to the existence of the US. However, pragmatic reality would require you to acknowledge the US is not packing up and going home, and you need to work with the existing legal structure to seek redress. 

&gt;I am being forced. Because if I choose not to pay, I get put into a cage by people with guns.

Are you able to leave, and so no longer be required, by law to pay taxes?

Then you have a choice.

&gt;Only a kook would think that society is better off having a small group of armed men terrorize and steal from the rest of the population.

Kooks are those who subscribe to binary, absolutist thinking, and can't deal with the reality, which is that taxes are a necessity in modern nation states, and the best nations in the world to live in have taxes to pay for well established  social institutions.

False,3,0,," *Up until WWII.  After the firebombing of Dresden, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki, it has been considered a poor tactic, since the new paradigm (which we learned after WWI didn't end the conflicts in Europe) is to facilitate reconstruction of a nation after defeating it.  Total war was a tactic used since prehistory, though.  But we no longer burn and salt the earth, if we can help it, or napalm entire cities.  At least, we aren't supposed to.

Of course, WWII was also the last formal war the world will probably ever see, so a lot of our new rules of engagement can be conveniently forgotten for ideological purposes.  Though this is all a bit of a red herring.

The fact is, it is my belief that a country that has a constitution and government based on the ideal of democratic sovereignty is better off than one ruled by a despot or theological oligarchy.  Our ostensible goal in both Iraq and Afghanistan was not to wage war on the people (as was the case in pretty much every other war in history), but rather against the people we judged to be criminals in their government.  Considering that goal, the level of collateral damage that has occurred is unacceptable, but that doesn't matter to the question of intent - aside from begging how we can learn from the experience in the future.  Given that we *did not* in fact bomb Iran, I think it means we've learned a valuable lesson, as a nation.

There are dozens of questions of maldistribution of resources and corruption.  There always are, when it comes to war.  And always should be.

&gt; the government provides a safety net that you don't see until you need it. It isn't perfect, but one rarely recognizes how important these are until the individual becomes poor and destitute

I agree that some safety net programs are useful, totally.  I never said which services we had to cut.  The military is a ""service"" - it's a defensive service.  I see I didn't make that clear enough.  I apologize for being a poor ""cartoonist"", but I don't apologize for your conclusions.

PROTIP: Switzerland *mandates* that every man between 20 and 50 keep a fully-automatic assault rifle in their home at all times, and Switzerland isn't exactly a hotbed of crime. It's high up on the ""firearms deaths"" chart relative to other european countries, yes, but you don't think that it might be a bit more worthwhile to consider *total* crime rates and *total* murder rates rather than what you're just trying to ban?

Also, you think maybe the US's crime problem has more to do with their massive drug problem, huge influx of gangs, and racial tensions that the UK simply doesn't have?

False,1,0,,"Yes... In your original point, now reiterated, you dismissed the author's statements as ""bullshit"" based on a view you hold that he somehow implied an equivalence between Nazism and colonialism when a cursory read makes it quite clear he didn't. However, what he did attempt to dispel is the reductive and self serving notion that WWII can primarily be explained as a battle of ideals, pitting democracy against 'totalitarianism' rather than more realistically as a struggle between great, largely imperial powers over land, resources and pre-eminence. i.e., the same shit wars have always been about since Thucydides first gave us a good account of one. He makes this claim on solid ground, because the imperial powers concerned on both sides have a well and storied history of being largely unconcerned with the democratic aspirations or liberation of their colonies, in fact often resorting to brutal repression. He further goes on to make the point that this even persisted beyond the end of hostilities and cites a couple of high profile examples. 
Hell, even France, of all nations, managed to cling to Vietnam before leaving in 1954 (against their will to, as if that particularly needed saying).

**Your point about the visas seems to assume that countering the persecution of the Jews was the only humanitarian objective imaginable and that, since that was imperfectly achieved, the motives of the allies were ipso facto selfish imperialism. I’m sorry, but that is just nonsense.**

It makes no such assumption, yet the difficulty and at times indifference Jewish refugees faced from other European nations in finding safety is well documented. ""Imperfectly acheived"" sounds like the understatement of the century. I won't claim the Jews were the only humanitarian objective, but their oft documented lack of consideration does create problems for the purely humanitarian justification of war theory.

**Your point about the Western allies pursuing imperial gains through WWII; sorry, I know of nothing to remotely support that view, unless you might think it was worth all the allied soldiers, sailors and airmen’s lives and limbs in an effort to gain control of some small, isolated barbed-wired sectors of Berlin for a couple of decades.**

Re-read what I said. I wrote that it was a war primarily over western interests, which is pretty uncontroversial. The parties involved were overwhelmingly European imperial powers, with the glaring exception of Japan, an Asian (surprise) imperial power. Africa, the middle east, central asia, south east asia, south america... Where were they in the fight? Oh right, they were all pretty much under colonial control and have no narrative in this grand historical clash to decide which ""free"" or ""totalitarian"" nations would be fucking them over in the aftermath and/or arbitrarily carving up their territories. It was a world war, insofar as the powers fighting largely were battling for ownership of it.

I only made a fuss because people tend to mentally align Israel with America, and therefore judge Israel based on their views of America.  This is the chief actual *reason* why most of the European left hate Israel: they think of it as an American outpost.  Of course, actually going to Israel tends to dispel most if not all illusions about the country, but for some reason most of the people who feel qualified to comment on Israel's conduct never actually go there.",True,1425985796,True,,t3_8sh3b,eaturbrainz,1,t1_c0ac36a,,t5_2cneq,1245194377,politics,0,0,t1_c0accrn,c0accrn
