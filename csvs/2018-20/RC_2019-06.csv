[],KrakenHasCome,1513052070.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_nz7uc8x,False,"Rather than looking at Noam Chomsky‚Äôs claim as true or false, I think it would be more beneficial to discuss it in terms of whether one agrees or disagrees with his analysis. I‚Äôm not trying to simply argue semantics, but if we think in terms of agreeing/disagreeing rather than true/false, than there is space for both sides to present valid arguments. Than people can decide which side they feel makes the most convincing arguments. 

I generally believe that there is a lot to be said for Chomsky‚Äôs analysis. One of the main justifications for the Vietnam War was the Domino Theory, that communism would spread throughout Southeast Asia. This has sometimes been dismissed as ridiculous, but radical ideologies have often been contagious. Think of the US and French Revolutions, which spread through Europe and Latin America. The revolutions of 1848, starting in Paris and spreading throughout Europe. The rise of fascist ideology/governments in the 1930s. The rise of Islamist movements after the Iran Revolution in 1979. We could go on. 

It makes sense that the US was more interested in preventing the spread of communism (which it detested) to countries where it had a greater geo-political and economic interest. Indochina was not of particular interest to the US prior to the Ho Chi Ming‚Äôs communist government taking power. However, other countries in the region, such as Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, even India, were all of much greater importance. Many of these countries had growing communist movements, particularly Indonesia, and the US was concerned that a successful Vietnam could serve as a rallying point and base of support for these movements. This makes sense, because the North Vietnamese government gained strength (at least partially) from the success of the communist revolution in China. 

Even though versions of communism did spread to Cambodia and Laos, it did not spread beyond that. While fighting for its existence, Vietnam was not in a position to act as a catalyst for further communist revolutions the way that Cuba did in Latin America and beyond. After the war, Vietnam also could not act as a catalyst, because it was so destroyed. Not to mention that it had to deal with a sociopathic neighbor (Pol Pot). 

As Chomsky mentions, this was not a complete victory for the US, because Vietnam and Indochina was largely lost to the US. However, it did largely succeed in preventing the Domino Theory. Since the Domino Theory was such an important reason for the US‚Äôs entry into Vietnam, I think it could be reasonably argued that the US achieved a major war aim, if not necessarily THE major war aim.",True,False,False,,0,1559348356,,False,0,{},eponpll,False,t3_buzsxe,False,True,t3_buzsxe,/r/history/comments/buzsxe/how_accurate_is_the_claim_that_the_us_achieved/eponpll/,False,,1568679010,6,True,[],False,history,t5_2qh53,r/history,public,0,

*Is this supposed to somehow justify their atrocious behaviour in other fields?*

You're being deliberately obtuse citing something that is a shallow stunt to deflect criticism.

Was Martin being praised by the New Left when he was at the Freedom School/Rampart College in the 1960s with Holocaust Deniers and Segregationists? Because he was associating with Holocaust Denial from at least that point.

Notice how I must provide ever more sources while you just deny anything you don't like and haven't backed up a single statement you have made? [Just who is it college failed?](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/On_the_spot_fallacy)

&gt;They most certainly are. The quotes are spliced up and interlaced with innuendo and commentary.

You said this in a different way once already and did not explain yourself or provide an argument or quotes or sources. I asked you about this and your response is to... do the same thing again. Asserting the opposite does not make you right or make for a compelling argument and it is not evidence.

**Martin told Reason's journalists that he relied on the works of Europe‚Äôs leading Holocaust denier, Paul Rassinier, whose books ‚Äî ‚ÄúDebunking the Genocide Myth,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Drama of European Jewry‚Äù ‚Äî described Nazi concentration camps as ‚Äúa gesture of compassion‚Äù designed by the Nazis to ‚Äúrehabilitate the strayed sheep.‚Äù According to Rassinier, the Holocaust was a ‚Äúswindle‚Äù concocted by money-grubbing Zionists out to ‚Äúmake Germany an ever-lasting milk cow for Israel.‚Äù** Tell me what has been spliced up and edited here and in his other acts of denialism since you claim it is out of context, and don't just assert the opposite or ad hom AGAIN. I was going to ask if you even know who the man is but it seems even here you will stoop to tawdry argumentative tricks to try score a cheap point:

&gt;Well, for one, it omits that Rassinier was a socialist who had spent time in a Nazi concentration camp

*That's called mitigation. Its the classic David Irving tactic, try to minimise and shift blame.*

And in your little history lesson you forget to mention the man is known as the father of Holocaust Denial.

- Legend of the Galactic Heroes (OVA 1988-1997) (Remake 2018-) A great epic space opera with a conflict focused on a corrupt democracy fighting a enlightened despot. Recent remake not a bad adaptation but it is a bit rushed and only covers the first book of 10 original has covered all. My advice watch the two prequel films My Conquest is A Sea of Stars and Overture to a New War (skip the first two episodes of the main series if you do) then the original OVA, Gaiden and then the remake.

- Saga of Tanya the Evil (2017) While the premise is pretty strange in some ways with the main character being the age/gender they are reincarnated into; that aspect exists more to have people underestimate or be fearful of her (and I guess it makes sense lore wise when you think about it). The premise is basically magic World War I (with some WW2 elements) with the author actually throwing in a few historical references here and there. (Tanya)

Some gaming buddies in Sweden are seemingly always taking time off, going on vacation to other places in Europe, etc.  I haven't had a vacation in over 10 years and I work, on average, 6 days a week and 60-70 hours a week... and make less than they do after you factor in things like paying for healthcare and such.  My take-home pay is higher, but after accounting for healthcare premiums, co-pays, medical bills, etc I actually make somewhat less than they do... despite working quite a lot more hours.  If I had kids or a family, I would have less time to spend with them and paternity leave here (which is still mostly in the form of *maternity* leave, with fathers SOL in most cases) is usually 3-9 *weeks* rather than the 9-24 *months* that seems to be more common abroad.

I'm not going to say stuff like this is *why* we have more people ""snapping"" than in other countries... but it might be something to consider.  Those things above contribute to a great deal of stress, and sudden spikes in stress on top of an extended period of lower stress seem to be relevant in whether or not someone ""snaps.""

I would also put social media as a primary factor in there.  When you work so many hours, you don't have a lot of time for socializing... so social media often seems to fill in that gap since humans are social creatures and most of us kinda go a little bonkers if deprived of social interaction for too long (one reason why solitary confinement is generally seen as inhumane if it's ever used for more than very brief periods.)  But I'd argue that replacing genuine socializing (for most people) with social media is alienating and dehumanizing.  It leads to people unironically using that whole ""NPCs"" 4chan joke, which has directly lead to at least a few mass shootings both here and abroad.

The [Fixed-term Parliaments Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-term_Parliaments_Act_2011) created a procedural morass that fucked the UK. What would have happened under the old system is the government would deem its EU Withdrawal Agreement a measure of confidence. That would exert maximum pressure for the ruling parliamentary majority to support the government's position. If this extra bit of leverage caused the vote to succeed, you'd get some form of Brexit with a deal. 

But if the vote failed, on the other hand, that would automatically dissolve parliament and force a new general election. There's no way a government would be able to lose 3 or 4 ""meaningful votes"" on the central political issue of the day and remain in office, which is what the Fixed-term Parliaments Act permits it to do. Since the new election would happen under proportional representation, the a pro-remain majority coalition would presumably be elected, regardless of which or how many constituencies or acres the people who support remain are distributed into. The new parliament would then unilaterally cancel Article 50 or schedule a second referendum. No Brexit.

Done. This isn't that hard.

Yes, I misunderstood some of your points. I measure a federal Europe more on the Federal Republic of Germany, because that‚Äôs what I know and you more on the looser US federation. However, on the question of how to get there, without ending in a Cul-de-Sac, our misunderstanding seems to be that we have very different views on the benevolence of politicians!

Here comes a long post:

What I take away from more than 200 years of modern democracy is that democracies are very bad at peaceful self-renewal. Constitutions evolve over time but the fundamental power structure is barely ever touched even when it has fallen completely out of time. Substantial changes to the power structure only happen after wars or revolutions. (Or if one of the two is imminent) And why would those in power ever reform the system of power? They have already run through the system. Any change could only risk their position. Being responsible for exercising power and structuring it at the same time is the fundamental conflict of interest in all democracies right now.

I think this is the reason why the three oldest modern democracies on the planet, USA, UK, and France, struggle so much right now. Although these are relatively prosperous times for them with a long period of peace.

In the OP I have given the example how the USA have come to a stalemate. However, even though the whole country gets ever more divided, the one thing both parties can agree on is that the two-party system has to be defended at all cost.

When in the UK, in a time before TV, radio or nationwide newspapers, the electoral system emerged it made sense that each constituency voted for the one guy they trusted the most. He would then get on a horse and ride to London to represent them. Sometime later David Cameron called the Brexit referendum because far right UKIP was stealing away conservative Tory votes which, in the by now absurd ‚ÄúWe vote for one guy to get on a horse‚Äù system, would have benefitted the left. Before the Brexit referendum there was another referendum on an electoral reform. But that birthed from the embarrassment of the expenses scandal. Later both big parties started the real project fear and campaigned heavily that democratic choice would mean constant instability. The election reform was downvoted and now the UK government is of course super stable.\^\^

In France, after the revolution, it made sense to elect a quasi-king for 5 years. Sometime later Mitterrand saw grave danger in the amount of power that is given to the French president, but even he later said ‚ÄúWell, now that I am president the republic is safe.‚Äù Today the whole continent shakes in fear with the French elections because someone truly horrible might become king for 5 years.

I think the German system is a relatively good one. But not because Germans are so brilliant, but because Germany is a relatively young democracy. With age more tensions will definitely arise.

Politicians in democracies aren‚Äôt necessarily more or less moral than in dictatorships we just made their interests align with ours. Also, every progressive knows that inaction is the default.

That is why I am suggesting to define the end goal, the utopia, at the beginning and make the system automatically go towards it unless action is taken against it. The pace at which this will happen should be as fast as possible, yet so slow that nobody gets scared and everyone has plenty of time to adapt. The ‚ÄúWe will cross this bridge when we get to it.‚Äù approach has me worried.

[],Ricewynd,1435684405.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_og1gl,False,"My first encounter with a true American obese person. This was in Florida as all true great American tales seem to start, I was around 15 years old, first visit to the states being taken to Disney Land.  
The trip was expensive and my family weren't exactly wealthy, so we'd cut corners where we could to save money. We were staying at a pretty cheap motel on International Drive, it was pretty basic but it did have an All-You-Can-Eat breakfast buffet. Now that buffet was a source of confusion for me from the start, muffins and steak for breakfast? Pancakes? and my first encounter with American Bacon, which isn't bacon guys.

Day one was interesting, we explored the local area in which I discovered we were entirely flanked by McDonalds restaurants, one of which boasts to be the worlds largest, the other is done up like a fancy restaurant, weird but ok.

Day two, people honk at you if you walk, no-one walks anywhere in Florida, the sidewalks are spotless from never being used and sometimes just end. Still trying to get used to the American way, adding tax after the purchase but not displaying it on the price tag, 10 minutes of TV and 30 minutes of commercials. The town I am in is hosting a cheer-leading tournament, everyone is taking it very seriously, an attempt to be polite and ask an innocent question ends in a half hour long lecture from a guy wearing a US Marines cap.  


Day three, it happens.

Now I've seen big people on this trip, sure, its America the people are bigger but I'm not expecting just how big.

I'm at Breakfast, expecting to spend a day at DisneyLand so I'm eating a lot, sausages, waffles, bit of beef hash and some of that weird powder shit you call eggs. Now I should explain the dining area is mostly all booths, they are arranged in a lazy crescent shape so, sitting at one end, I can clearly see the table at the other end. In the typical youthful innocence I exude back then I had assumed the other end table was being used to store extra food, it's piled high with trays of shit, not plates, full trays of every imaginable thing on that breakfast menu. A few times a chef comes out and adds to the pile. Someone has covered the seats with a mound of tarps and i think nothing of it, until the fucking tarp moves.

It's not a mound of tarps its a fucking person.

She was huge and I'm not talking fat, I'm talking Gigantic. If she went swimming at the beach she would raise the global water level, she is so titanically massive if she fell over the blast radius would be 17 miles. And she is hungry, by god is she hungry.

The tables we are all at are bolted to the ground, the seats are attached to them so you cannot move the seat or the table, but she has. The table is 'raised' off the ground on one side, you can see the screws dangling, the metal bar that connects the seats to the table is bending backwards, quite alarmingly, and yet this is not enough. Her fat rolls engulf one side of the table, you cannot visibly see the edge. The chairs go in three deep and she is taking up all of them and yet more of her spills over the side. It is a horrific sight.

She finished a bowl of cereal and adds it to THE TOWER of bowls. Her left arms is twice the size of my entire body. I fight the urge to stand up, salute and sing the American national anthem as she picks up a tray of bacon and merrily consumes more food than me and the rest of my family combined would eat that entire week.  
But what really got me, was just how normal it seemed. No-one was reacting to this, the manager wasn't having a fit and trying to charge her extra, the chefs were keeping the regular buffet topped up as well as her own personal one with a level of blank faced professionalism I'd expect at the Ivy. No-one else in the place was looking at her, everyone was acting as if this was just another day and now I feel bad for staring and yet, by no stretch of the imagination was she the largest person I saw.

I was aware of the stereotypes, we all were, living in Europe we got a lot of larger Americans, fanny-packs, &lt;insert Army Division here&gt; flat caps, beige slacks, blocking up the isles at museum exhibits, but nothing like this.

The only way we could stop it, as an EU member, is if it were subject to veto, which *de jure* federalisation would be because it'd represent a treaty change (the biggest possible).

- [in a follow up to an earlier answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/88a0qu/why_did_the_spanish_conquest_of_mexico_end_up/dwowehk/) I talk about this question; and in some more length in that thread [about judicial and political effects of European contact in central Mexico](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/88a0qu/why_did_the_spanish_conquest_of_mexico_end_up/dwj6qnl/).

- and in another thread I discuss [Spanish control over colonial Mexico and resistance to it](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/8q2lfr/in_the_wake_of_the_defeat_of_the_aztecs_where_did/e0tody9/?context=3). 

In order to not just throw in these older (quite long) answers here I'm summing up their main points below, hope this helps: 


The Aztec Triple Alliance was dominated by the Mexica (of Tenochtitlan) decades before the Spanish conquest. While different native groups had different reasons to join forces with the Spanish, resistance to the Mexica was a common thread : For tributary states, the tributes they had to pay to Tenochtitlan were seen as too high ; for enemies of the Triple Alliance like Tlaxcala, resistance also made sense, as a way to escape the isolation their state was in, surrounded by Triple Alliance territories. 

And even former members of the Alliance switched sides : the Acolhua were in the grips of a civil war at the time of conquest, with the faction opposed to the Mexica providing assistance to the Spanish. The point being that there were a variety of reasons for siding with the Spanish, but that for many Nahua groups it made sense in order to overthrow the Mexica who were often perceived as ¬´ tyrannic ¬ª.

How the Tlaxcalans and others perceived themselves during the conquest is hard to answer ‚Äì our only eyewitness accounts come from Spaniards (who don't mention native allies all that much). Native accounts come starting in the mid-16th century, and are already colored by the colonial society. But briefly put, these native histories highlight both the centrality of the large numbers of native allies to the conquest (which was for real), and the special importance of their own state to the conquests' ¬´ success ¬ª (which is more debatable in each case).

 I'd argue here that the native allies' position was somewhere in between those two poles : clearly the Spanish could not have managed to overthrow the Mexica without the massive help of Tlaxcalans, Huejotzincans and others, which they would have probably been aware of. On the other hand, the Spanish did have some serious military advantages vis-a-vis their allies (e.g. swords and horses) due to which e.g. the Tlaxcalans would have probably seen themselves as the most important native allies but under Spanish command.

The Spanish initially left many native rulers in power, as subordinates to the Spanish Crown; and made possible lawsuits by indigenous elites and even commoners to litigate for their rights before courts. In addition, both conquistadors and native nobles at first profited from intermarrying to forge dynastic connections and legitimacy. These together with various other factors - a major one being the increasingly devastating epidemies - meant that there was serious incentive for many Nahua states to accept the Spanish as one more among a longer lineage of conquerors in central Mesoamerica. This did not mean however that Spanish rule was secure in the early colonial period.

------

I'm discussing the question of when the Spanish rule was pretty much secure over colonial Mexico in more detail in the 2nd answer I linked to, so just the main points here from that one: the Mixton War in the 1540s was probably the last serious challenge to Spanish overrule in colonial Mexico. This was a major military campaign by the Mixtecs that was only won through the Spanish through personal intervention by the viceroy. 

Looking further afield though, the Spanish never controlled all of New Spain (the name of the Spanish viceroyalty then) ‚Äì as was the case in many other parts of Spanish America. Two areas that would prove esp. difficult to conquer and raised resistance throughout colonial times were Northern regions (like Nueva Galicia and Nuevo Mexico), and Yucat√°n.

These led to major Spanish campaigns with important assistance of native allies throughout the 17th c. and later, not always successful. So that while central Mexico was an important imperial centre by the mid 16th century, other regions of central America were only partly or not under full Spanish control throughout the colony.",True,False,False,,0,1559390918,,1559391426,0,{},eppt0k6,False,t3_bvj5hc,False,True,t3_bvj5hc,/r/AskHistorians/comments/bvj5hc/why_did_the_natives_side_with_the_spanish/eppt0k6/,False,,1568698023,10,True,[],False,AskHistorians,t5_2ssp3,r/AskHistorians,public,0,

Nowhere was this more evident in Italy, my own area of interest, where the political elite contained a segment of prosperous urban professionals, some of which were educated in institutions whose modern descendants are still active today. 

Of course, that is not to say Medieval Europe was not a place beset by stark inequality, or that the professional service industry was the largest component of the economy. Medieval Europe was indeed a very unequal society, and most people's economic activity was agriculture. While towns and cities did exist, many more people lived in small country hamlets. In many regions, large landowners could indeed unfairly exploit their tenants (""Help help, I'm being oppressed!""). However, in other regions small landholders were the majority, with few large magnates renting plots of land. In other regions still, a mix of small and large landowners coexisted with renters and serfs. But each individual region of Europe was characterized by its own social distinctions, shaped by their individual history and institutions. To again offer the example of Italy, while the North was characterized by many small landowners who participated frequently in the economic life of nearby cities and towns, in the South landed magnates were much more powerful. This, along with other factors, allowed for the creation of a single unified state in the South (whose main threat to stability came from internal upheavals) while the North experienced political fragmentation (whose existential threats were instead characterized by external rivalries). Not only did political organization develop different shades, but so did social organization. Across the Western Mediterranean and beyond, landowners could establish presences in cities and invest in commercial enterprises, while prosperous urban professionals, merchants, and artisans could purchase estates in the countryside. In some cities, like Florence, membership in a Merchant Guild was an important part of political enfranchisement, even if the member in question did not practice their guild's trade themselves (investment in an enterprise, or mere association with someone who did, was enough). In other cities, like Milan, land ownership remained an important component of political enfranchisement. Many times, prosperous urbanites could clash with suburban landowners, as could small landowners with large landowners, or the urban poor pit themselves against the urban rich. 

It is also important to keep in mind that Europe dramatically changed over the centuries called ""the middle ages."" In the eighth century, Italy was torn apart by war pitting the Byzantine Empire against the Lombard Kingdom, while in modern France the Carolingian Dynasty was founding an Empire, and England was divided amongst seven competing kingdoms. Two centuries later, Italy and Germany would experience an intellectual reawakening under the Ottonian dynasty, while in France the monarchy was experiencing a resurgence after a steep decline, and England was divided in two between the Danes and Anglo-Saxons.

The role of universities changed over the centuries as well. The earliest Universities, and I'm using the word in the broadest possible sense, were documented as early as the tenth century. But the inclusion of more modern courses of study like engineering (just as an example) would only really begin in earnest in the 19th century as Polytechnic Universities emerged offering courses adapted to industrialized society. Indeed for much of the Medieval period and beyond, in many professions training and certification would have been regulated by individual guilds, who set rules for apprenticeship and mastery of their respective arts. While having a family relative in a guild was seldom an explicit prerequisite for membership (prosperous artisans and professionals were often on the lookout for fresh manpower to take on as apprentices) having a trusted family member who knew the ropes could be a valuable boost when navigating the complex world of Medieval Guilds. 

In the broadest sense, the earliest western european universities were collections of practitioners in law and theology. This is what was being taught at the time of the medieval founding dates of the oldest universities in Europe, like Bologna or Oxford. But while there is indeed evidence of students being taught by master practitioners in the eleventh century (indicating that teaching was probably already well established) it would be an enormous stretch to assume these lessons world have born resemblance to modern institutions of higher learning.

In this earliest period (prior to the twelfth and thirteenth centuries) a university education would have been entirely religious in nature, geared to preparing a student for a life in the clergy. Nearly other professions would have been managed by an apprenticeship system, with degrees of formalization varying from place to place. It is also true that, in Italy at least, the destructiveness of the Lombard Wars had favored a social system where disproportionately wealthy individuals with time and resources could dedicate themselves to studying things like law and architecture on their own, developing mastery across multiple topics (think along the lines of designing their own palaces and castles, while also concocting legal arguments against their political enemies; an early Doge of Venice, Pietro Orseolo, was one such polymath). But in a society with a close relationship between religion, politics, and law, centers of religious teaching soon also became centers of legal study. Under the Ottonian Empire, the collection of scholars in the town of Pavia became one such center, validated by monarchs preferring Pavia it to the larger but more unruly city of Milan nearby. Pavia's status was later formalized in the 14th century by the rulers of Milan, and remains the seat of a University to this day. Universities could also spring up where there was the opportunity to exchange ideas: Padua and Bologna, for example, were longstanding Byzantine outposts in Italy, where Imperial Laws were still rigorously enforced and aspiring scholars could easily recover religious and legal texts. Thus Padua and Bologna had been welcoming students for centuries long before their universities were formally founded in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries respectively. There were also many other cities in Italy where renowned practitioners resided who could also offer students a instruction deemed valid; some of these were later recognized and formalized, while others were not. And finally, in many of these places concentrated knowledge of Latin and Greek facilitated the outgrowth of additional topics of study, like philosophy and medicine.  

The kind of person which would move to Bologna, Padua, or Pavia in order to study would have been a person of means aspiring for a career in the law, in the church, and in later centuries, as a medical practitioner (but not a surgeon; that was considered a separate, more tradesman-like profession). But the great dynasties of Medieval Europe, however, could afford tutors to come to them and prepare their children for the rigors of political life, even if their children were to enter a career in the clergy. So the profile of the average university student, such as we can attempt identify, would be wealthy, but not too wealthy. And it's also important to keep in mind that while the kinds of students in universities were upper-middle-class (or lower-upper-class) not all upper-middle-class youngsters learned their trade in universities. Prosperous moneychangers, wool merchants, and other tradesmen whose guild education was considered just as formal could indeed inherit or develop large and lucrative enterprises. Through their guilds, they could even develop political influence and connections, all without an education from the universities.",True,False,False,,0,1559392981,,1560874268,0,{},eppvn7u,False,t3_buon8l,False,False,t3_buon8l,/r/AskHistorians/comments/buon8l/which_class_of_the_social_pyramid_or_which/eppvn7u/,False,,1568699253,7,True,[],False,AskHistorians,t5_2ssp3,r/AskHistorians,public,0,

The agreement only works so long as it is enforceable. If the UK decided that it no longer wanted to abide by the terms of the agreement it could unilaterally decide to leave, however this would be akin to a no deal Brexit. The backstop also originated as a British proposal to solve the Irish border problem, this isn't some EU invention being forced upon the British people.

Whilst I do believe that a lot of the economic forecasts were exaggerated, it is important to remember that we are still in the EU. The economic system has not changed, the only thing liable to change at the moment would be confidence. Whilst I similarly believe that forecasts of a No Deal Brexit are also exaggerated, I do believe that economically the UK will be worse off - most Brexiteers even accept this but believe it is an acceptable cost for democracy or other Brexit issues. Rory Stewart has raised important concerns over the British automobile industry and its ability to export/ compete with cheap foreign exports in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Patrick Minford, an economist in favour of Brexit, admitted that the British automobile industry would be run into the ground but in the long run this would be OK as the British economy would shift to service-based tertiary level employment instead, and yet car manufacturing accounts for 12%, close to a million jobs, of the British economy. Without heavy subsidies/ tariffs its likely the industry would struggle to cope with a No Deal Brexit, but maybe I'm wrong, I'm not an economist.

If you may allow me, may I offer a critique of your position. You don't seem to especially engage in the benefits of leaving the European Union, at least you have mentioned any in this discourse.

What identity crises? Why is it that Armenians call themselves as an Indo-European people when you are genetically the most similar to the Semitic Assyrians and Iraqis? Not much is known about Urartian as well, some speculate they were the ancestors of the Nakh peoples and not the Armenians. I have never seen a single Azerbaijani claim Urartu either.

Azerbaijani people are Turkic as well. You can drop the pure nonsense. Nobody on this planet is pure. Our ancestors were Seljuk Turkmen who mixed with the locals when we conquered the region. Intermixing between Persians, Caucasians and Anatolians by the Seljuks is well recorded. 

Do not conflate the insecurities of others on our people. Persian nationalists claiming ""Azerbaijanis wuz pure iranics n shiet who wuz Turkified by 200 mongol samurai warriors from Japan, you have no Turkic genetikikics."" Is bullshit claim that should not be brushed onto us either. 

&gt;The are lots of reasons why we are more liked, despite the caviar diplomacy of your country. But that is limited to the Western world mainly. The views of the Muslim countries are different. 

Such as? What views of the Muslim countries? They support you because they are uneducated and morons. Arabs have never been good at choosing friends, look at what the British ended up doing to the region. These Arabs who support Armenians because ""Armenians wuz so similar to us. Armenians love us. Armenia and Arabs deep history. Armenians love Islam and respect it."" Are fucking delusional.

&gt;Because whatever the crimes were committed by Armenians, they don't stand close in the sheer volume, scale, and cruelty to the ones committed against us. Neither Turkey nor Azerbaijan are anywhere close to accepting any crimes they made, quite the opposite. So why should we? If Armenians killed 1.5 million Azeris in 1918 and then continued claiming ""duh the Azeris were resisting and trying to kill us in return, so they deserved it"", how would you feel? I suppose the words ""we have our share of blame"" wouldn't appear out of your mouth.

Let me guess Azerbaijan killed 1.5 million Armenians? I never knew Azerbaijanis in the Caucasus traveled all the way to Anatolia to kill Armenians. Vay vay vay. Also since when did it become 1.5 million? 

At first it was 500,000. Then a decade later it became 800,000. Then it became 1,000,000. I had seen 1,200,000 and now today I see 1,500,000. Why do the figures inflate every decade?

Munderloh and her colleague Timothy Kurtti had grown and examined a rickettsial species discovered by Willy, WB-8‚Äì2, and had isolated another of these strange rickettsias, MOAa, but they couldn‚Äôt figure out where they‚Äôd come from. They asked Weller to analyze their genomes in the same way that 23andMe decodes the ancestry of humans: by sequencing parts of the genome and tracking back the genes that had been passed down from generation to generation. Weller accepted the challenge and ran a genetic analysis, and she discovered a puzzling thing: while the bulk of the rickettsias‚Äô genomes were closely related to R. montana (now R. montanensis), parts were from an Old World species, not a North American one.

&gt;The corporate media march in lock step with the United States and its allies around the world. They have a tacit agreement to exclude any information which might inconvenience pro-war, pro-interventionist narratives.

&gt;Claims of chemical weapons use by the Syrian government are but one example of this tactic. These improbable stories have been repeated with regularity ever since the United States and its allies began using jihadist proxies to overthrow the Syrian government in 2011. In 2013 we were told that president Assad waged a chemical weapons attack on the same day that United Nations weapons inspectors arrived in the country. It is an understatement to say that this scenario is unlikely to be true.

&gt;In 2018 the U.S. and its European allies repeated that they would take military action against Syria if there were any reports of chemical weapons use. Like clockwork, such an event was reported and a bombing campaign took place in April of that year.

&gt;Anyone with common sense should doubt these reports. Assad had no reason to do anything which guaranteed military attacks on his country. Furthermore, persons with credibility and expertise had already provided evidence that these claims are nothing but false flags meant to get public buy-in for aggression.

-------------

&gt;The U.S. Congress came very close to calling for a Syrian war in a May 20, 2019 letter signed by 70% of its members . The AIPAC inspired massive calls for president Trump to ‚Äústabilize‚Äù Syria, protect Israel and stop Russian and Iranian influence. The call was bipartisan and bicameral with 79 senators and 303 members of the house signing on to the call for imperialism. Presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Cory Booker are among those calling for the dangerous slippery slope. Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) chairwoman Karen Bass signed too as did Hakeem Jeffries, James Clyburn, and Elijah Cummings among others.

&gt;Americans have been fed a steady diet of ‚ÄúAssad the butcher‚Äù and any counter narrative is disappeared, just like the OPCW leak. It is a useful ploy to have around. Let us not forget that last year‚Äôs bombing resulted in praise from the so-called resistance crowd who think they are supporting a humanitarian action.

The majority of recognized tribes have ""Indian"" in the name.  These are sovereign nations with their own laws and they can change their official name at any time. I'm not native, but I have worked professionally for two large tribes and I've spent my entire life around Indians. They will always refer to themselves as Indians, especially in an informal setting. In formal situations (i.e. in the company of non-tribal elected officials, or in the company or certain other non-tribal people) they often refer to themselves as native, and then sometimes/rarely as Native American.

""Indian"" is certainly a misnomer, but it's not derogatory or improper. Not having spent time around Indians, it is understandable someone might believe it is wrong, but it is really irritating when people who don't know about these things believe they are doing everyone a favor by imposing the ""correct"" term. Referring to Hispanics as Latin is also a huge misnomer, but no one ever corrects another for using it. Latins were an ancient hill tribe from Italy. Hell, even Hispanic is a misnomer for describing central American indigenous peoples. ""Anglo"" is commonly used as a blanket description of people of European descent, but Anglo comes from Angle, a Germanic tribe that settled in Britain. Genetically, only English people and the contemporary descendants on the lower Jutland peninsula are Anglos, but no one has any problems referring to Poles, Swedes, Spaniards, Swiss, etc., as Anglos.

Once you have established that it's okay to impose your preferred government form by violent force, you lose the high ground when it comes to complain about someone imposing theirs over yours in turn.

&gt;The reactionaries like to use violence, and are usually better at it. Don't drop down to their level, they're at the advantage there.

So, what's your suggestion then? Sit tight and watch as they destroy the 8-hour day? Sit tight and watch as they force us to work 7 days a week? Sit tight and watch as we see safety regulations being thrown out of the window to reduce costs despite the fact that this endangers our lives? Sit tight and watch as they exploit more and more laborers, especially the ones who are below the poverty line and often have no choice but to take any job they can get? Should we sit out and watch them exploit the most vulnerable members of our society?

&gt;Which would have resulted in exactly nothing but corpses and bludgeonings without a reformist wing to anchor that pressure in the legislation, step by step.

You're kidding, right? Don't try to co-opt the struggle of the Haymarket Martyrs. Just don't.

&gt;Sure, that's a normal evolution. Parties evolve from ideologically pure and totally irrelevant, by growing more and more pragmatic, increasing effectivity and reducing ideological purity, until they are faceless parties that do whatever keeps them in power. They usually have started to lose votes long before that, and will become more and more irrelevant again. But that's not important, parties are not important, they are throwaway tools: what is important is what they achieve while circling down towards the drain.

And what they have achieved is fairly simple. The continuous deterioration of the conditions of the working class all around the world. This is what is feeding the far-right. This is why you hear people ""pining for the good ol' days"". You can't keep making people poorer and poorer and then expect them to be content.

&gt;This does not answer why you should only aim for revolution and not for reformism while we're waiting for the revolution to happen. If you succeed in combating neoliberal policies without revolution you don't need a revolution anymore.

Because no ""reformist"" entity is trying to combat neoliberal policies. Neoliberalism has been running unopposed within the EU (and other major economic powers) for at least the past 30 years (it could be more but I wasn't born before that so I can't judge). There is no ""reformist wing"" that is trying to pressure the legislation and make the situation better for workers. Not one that has ever had any sort of power to do something about it, at least.

&gt;Do you honestly think the far right would collapse without the EU as bogeyman? Hello?

The far-right would find another boogeyman, that's a given. But would that boogeyman be as effective as the EU currently is? Because, you have to admit, the EU makes for a damn good boogeyman since it has contributed significantly to the impoverishment of the working classes across the continent.

&gt;Now you're affirming it yourself: yes, the individual member states are hostile to refugees. Even more so, and EU courts have been a backstop against them reducing refugee rights further. So reducing EU influence will not improve the refugee situation.

The states, yes. Not the people.

&gt;The EU is after all still democratic and can't impose an open border policy on its members.

Is it? I remember when Greece was not allowed to leave the monetary union 4 years ago. That didn't seem very democratic to me.

&gt;That's anecdotal evidence. Look at the election results. Or just try to run with an open border programme. Don't wear new clothes, you won't dodge all rotten eggs.

I can tell you that in my country, at least, a party that was running with an open border program did win the last national elections. It lost the EU elections a week ago and it may lose the next national elections in July but that's for reasons that aren't all that connected to the refugee situation.

&gt;Well, how am I going to break it to you: consider that half of them are worse than average, that's just a fact..

What are you talking about here? IQ scores? Who gives a shit about that? Recognizing what your rights are and who fights for them is pretty damn easy. It doesn't take a genius to do that.

&gt;Votes for the extreme right aren't based on facts, you're not going to get them out of it by a quiet rational explanation. Please come over and prove me wrong, we've got 12-18% of the electorate here to practice on. Their latest trick is to copy the program of the left with the ""* not for foreigners"" clause attached. Argue against that.

Votes for the far-right are based on anger. An anger that is based on the further deterioration of the material conditions of the working class. Why do you think that the far-right wasn't even voted by 1% of the electorate before the financial crisis? The rise of fascism is always fueled by a financial crisis. That was true in the Inter-War period and it is true now.

&gt;Lol. Without Schengen, you take away the right of labor to move freely... without any guarantees at all on refugee rights. In fact, many countries have already made very clear they are very displeased with the quota, so they certainly won't take more, and the national election trends certainly don't testify of a refugee-friendly stream that is somehow hamstrung by the. In fact, the agreements at the EU level do not, in any way, forbid states to receive more refugee candidates. So you're just throwing worker rights under the bus for nothing.

So, you think that the right to be exploited in the Netherlands, in Spain or Romania is a worker right? Freedom of movement for workers in the EU isn't set up to benefit the workers. It's set up to benefit their bosses.

&gt;See, that's the absolute claim of ideological purity again. For us, or against us. You're about as intolerant as the far right to people of different views. They also consider everyone who doesn't automatically accept their ukases against migrants as part of the big traitor conspiracy against the people. I'm really sick of 19th century identity politics.

Ideological purity? And you played the ""identity politics"" card, too? That's just rich.

&amp;#x200B;

* Roosevelt beats Wilson in the 1912 election and becomes president, and joins the great war several months after the sinking of the Lusitania.
* The US joining helps relieve the Russians as German troops are sent west, allowing them to recover and eventually the Germans are forced to sue for peace in 1917, with the victory providing public support for the provisional government which establishes a democracy in Russia during the 1920s.
* Austria-Hungary collapses, as does the Ottoman empire. A Polish vassal state (of Russia) is created as a buffer between Germany and Russia, while Serbia creates the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Britain supports the Hashemites in creating an Arab state from the former Ottoman holdings and defeating their rivals on the peninsula, while a Shia state is created in Mesopotamia. The peace terms are much less harsh on Germany than in our timeline, allowing them to keep some of their colonies and not forcing heavy reparations on them. Over time the cost of the great war and the lives lost created a mentality that war should never again be fought in Europe, and this is mirrored in France with the French and Germans signing a non-aggression pact in the 1930s, with their relationship gradually mending over time.
* Like in our timeline Mussolini takes over Italy while Japan becomes increasingly aggressive in the east, eventually launching an invasion of China in 1937
* The invasion and subsequent atrocities committed by the Japanese cause Britain and the US to place sanctions on Japan in 1940, stopping most exports to it and this causes Japan to retaliate, attacking American and European territories like in our timeline, causing Britain, France and the US to declare war on Japan, while Italy invades British colonies in Africa.
* After several years, Italy is defeated and occupied while Japan falls into civil war as the result of an Anglo-American blockade and bombing campaign.
* After the war, Britain starts to re-organise their holdings abroad to make the empire more workable, merging some colonies to form new dominions and creating an imperial council, giving the dominions autonomy, while similar efforts are made by most other European empires.

**Article**:

&gt; ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) ‚Äî The tagline makes the solution sound so simple: ‚ÄúGamble responsibly.‚Äù

&gt; It‚Äôs anything but for those who struggle with compulsive gambling. Instead, the footnote caps a powerful new temptation as ads for sports betting emerge in states that have recently legalized an activity once banned in most of the United States.

&gt; Sharon, a 39-year-old homemaker, decided with her husband to move from New Jersey to New York specifically to get away from legalized sports betting, but still sees ads frequently that remind her of the tens of thousands of dollars in debt she racked up on a wagering app.

&gt; Charlie, an information technology professional from suburban Philadelphia, says the advertisements and easy access makes wagering ‚Äútempting as hell,‚Äù even as his losses mounted to $400,000 as he bet online while traveling on service calls.

&gt; They‚Äôve complicated addiction recovery for Gary, a real estate agent from New Jersey who attends support group meetings and has lost nearly $2 million over a lifetime of gambling.

&gt; ‚ÄúIt seems like every fourth commercial, there‚Äôs one telling you how easy it is to bet on sports and make money,‚Äù said Gary, who like other gamblers spoke to The Associated Press on condition that his full name not be used because of stigmas some people associate with unhealthy gambling.

&gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs right in front of my eyes, and even though I‚Äôve been in recovery for years and go regularly to Gamblers Anonymous meetings, it‚Äôs starting to bother me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI can feel it.‚Äù

&gt; Advertising supporting the nascent sports betting industry has not drawn the same level of scrutiny from regulators and lawmakers in the U.S. as counterparts in Europe, where several countries strictly regulate or even ban gambling ads, including those for sports betting.

&gt; One year after the U.S. Supreme Court ended an effective monopoly in Nevada, eight states have begun taking legal sports wagers. Three states and the District of Columbia have passed laws to create new markets and a handful of legislatures are still considering bills. None of the laws passed have significant restrictions for sports betting ads.

&gt; The commercial casino industry wants to keep it that way.

&gt; The American Gaming Association, the gambling industry‚Äôs main trade group and lobbying arm, recently issued voluntary guidelines for sports betting advertising in a bid to stay ahead of possible government regulation, drawing on the experience of the liquor industry to develop self-regulations.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe want to get in front of this in a way that is meaningful,‚Äù said Sara Slane, the group‚Äôs senior vice president of public affairs. ‚ÄúWe view the opportunity to offer sports betting on a state-by-state level as a privilege, and there needs to be responsible advertising that‚Äôs tied to that.‚Äù

&gt; Indeed, those who struggle with gambling find ads touting Super Bowl or March Madness wagers similar to beer ads tempting those with alcoholism or fast food ads enticing those with unhealthy eating habits. Though a hurdle for some, the ads are an understandable facet of expanded betting with sportsbooks chasing new customers to bet legally and leisurely, just like millions of people who visit casinos, buy lottery tickets or drink and eat without harmful consequences.

&gt; ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not one commercial break it seems where you don‚Äôt see one of these ads. As much as I tried to stop, there are all these incentives: a $500 free bet, we‚Äôll refund your first bet even if you lose. They‚Äôre everywhere I look,‚Äù said Sharon, who lives in a New York TV market that‚Äôs a key target for advertisers of New Jersey sportsbooks. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a constant reminder of my problem. It brings an incredible amount of guilt and shame for me, and yet there‚Äôs still this incredible temptation that these ads make worse.‚Äù

&gt; Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling, thinks the details of gambling ads haven‚Äôt been explored enough.

&gt; ‚ÄúIn the U.S., if you say, ‚ÄòGamble responsibly,‚Äô you‚Äôve now met the responsible gambling standard,‚Äù Whyte said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be a big issue. There‚Äôs heightened concern for people struggling with gambling addiction and relapse. And I don‚Äôt see a lot of discussion about this.‚Äù

&gt; Major sportsbooks all say they train their workers to spot people with potential gambling problems, offering various solutions including self-imposed betting ‚Äútimeouts‚Äù for those who want them. In New Jersey, some money from licensing fees for sports betting fund c...

&gt;""The size and makeup of measles outbreaks has changed since the 1980s. Prior to 1989, the majority of outbreaks occurred among middle, high school and college student populations. As many as 95% of persons infected during these outbreaks had received one prior dose of measles vaccine. A second dose of measles vaccine was recommended for school-aged children in 1989, and all states now require two doses of measles vaccine for school-aged children. As a result, measles outbreaks in school settings are now uncommon.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 2008 a total of 140 measles cases was reported, the largest annual total since 1996. Eighty nine percent of these cases were imported from or associated with importations from other countries, particularly countries in Europe where several outbreaks are ongoing. Persons younger than 20 years of age accounted for 76% of the cases; 91% were in persons who were unvaccinated (most because of personal or religious beliefs) or of unknown vaccination status. The increase in the number of cases of measles in 2008 was not a result of a greater number of imported measles cases. It was the result of more measles transmission after the virus was imported. The importation-associated cases occurred largely among school-aged children who were eligible for vaccination but whose parents chose not to have them vaccinated. Many of these children were home-schooled and not subject to school entry vaccination requirements.  
&gt;  
&gt;In 2011, CDC reported 16 outbreaks of measles and 220 measles cases, most of which were imported cases in unvaccinated persons. Among the U.S. measles cases in persons 16 months through 19 years reported in 2011, 62% were in persons not vaccinated for a nonmedical reason.""",True,False,False,,0,1559407269,,False,0,{},epqk8vj,False,t3_bvg4uw,False,True,t1_epqie0o,/r/antivax/comments/bvg4uw/it_do_be_like_that/epqk8vj/,False,,1568710826,1,True,[],False,antivax,t5_2uz12,r/antivax,public,0,

In law, common law (also known as judicial precedent or judge-made law, or case law) is that body of law derived from judicial decisions of courts and similar tribunals.  The defining characteristic of ‚Äúcommon law‚Äù is that it arises as precedent.  In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts, and synthesizes the principles of those past cases as applicable to the current facts.  If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (a principle known as stare decisis).

**English contract law**

English contract law is a body of law regulating contracts in England and Wales. With its roots in the lex mercatoria and the activism of the judiciary during the industrial revolution, it shares a heritage with countries across the Commonwealth (such as Australia, Canada, India), and to a lesser extent the United States. It is also experiencing gradual change because of the UK's membership of the European Union and international organisations like Unidroit. Any agreement that is enforceable in court is a contract.

Have you considered the tone with which you ask?

&gt; Transgender people make really odd claims.

See, this kinda shit is problematic. You call people ""odd"" - people who live their entire lives being dehumanized because they're ""odd"" or ""weird"" or ""sick"" or ""messed up"" - and wonder why people are impatient. You may not intend the same, but you should look at yourself when oppressed people are impatient with you, not them.

&gt; Like, what does it mean to identify as a certain gender? I legit have no idea. As far as I can tell, gender norms are just a social construct.

Gender is a social norm mapped onto the ways in which we express ourselves and the roles we fill in society (an oversimplification). People who identify as a certain gender are expressing where they feel they fit into that sociological map.

&gt; If a male claims to be a woman, what does that imply?

That she's a woman, and not a male.

&gt; Is the desire to literally be biologically female?

If you mean getting surgery, then for some, not others.

&gt; That doesn't make the male into a female though

Yes, it does.

&gt; Because the traditional definition would simply be a human female, but this is a male.

This isn't the ""traditional definition."" It's the Eurocentric definition, because European capitalism invented these norms. There's nothing natural or inherent about it.

&gt; Is a woman someone who desires to be female? Or is a woman someone who desires to conform to conventional social gender roles? Is it a desire to be treated as a woman? What does that even mean?

These are deep questions, for sure, and there's a lot of scholarship about it. If you want to learn, there are many theories on this. But you need to be careful with your language. I'm willing to bet that somebody has already told you that a trans woman is not, in any sense, a man, but you're still trying to claim that. I have serious doubts that you're open minded, but I hope I'm wrong.

[],SaifEdinne,1515714678.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_rneoh6x,False,"&gt;I‚Äôm not denying the role of the french in the revolution, not in the least, my point was that the colonists were the catalyst for the revolution, the French didn‚Äôt come fight the war for the Americans, the Americans picked up arms and said this is not right and we are going to make it right. My point is change starts with the people.

Whether the cause for rebellion was just or not is up for debate but yes, it started with some of the colonists rising up.

&gt;Your point about the world wars is accurate, and yes we did wait until we were attacked to formally declare war but we were very much so supporting the allied effort, and had we not gotten involved what language do you think you would be speaking today? My money is on German.

That isn't the point. You are claiming that the U.S. were always beacons of freedom and defenders of democracy, but when the Nazis were attacking the Western democracy, they waited untill the last moment. And if I remember correctly, it were the Russians that actually defeated the Germans, they were the ones that actually invested a lot of time, manpower and effort into this.

But afterwards it were the Americans that defended Western Europe from the Sovjets, yes.

&gt;Also if you want to talk all kinds of shit based on what you have seen on the news that is awesome, but if you ever get a chance to go to Iraq, Afghanistan or any of these other countries and actually talk to the people to see what it meant to them to have an American presence in their country then you will find the the vast majority found great stability and prosperity as they were allowed not only to work and live their lives they were also able to keep their money, property and freedoms without having to worry about things like paying off the taliban or whoever, I mean I get it it‚Äôs easy to hide behind a screen and screech all of this

I live in a very multicultural city. My neighbours are Syrian, my friends are Iranian, Tsetsenian, Iraqi, Turkish, ... I studied with a Palestinian, a Thai and a Greek. I think my world knowledge are genuine when considering this. So yes, I do know how Iraqis feel when talking about how the U.S. destroyed their homecountry for no valid reason at all, how they left the country after creating a power vacuum that ISIS could fill in. How the U.S. created extremism in Iraq which ISIS capitalized on to increase their power.

So no, I'm not ""screeching"" behind a screen, I'm talking real sentiments that actually lives in, at least, a big part of the Iraqi people. Hell, the whole world acknowledges the major error the U.S. did in Iraq and their responsibility regarding ISIS, except for the U.S. and Israel.

And regarding the Taliban, how is the U.S. ""fighting"" the Taliban while supporting Saudi Arabia who are backing the Taliban with weapons, supplies, generals, intell, ... ?? It's more like that the U.S. are strengthening the Taliban with their drone strikes that causes the countless civilian deaths that lead to more extremism on which the Taliban feeds on.

&gt;As far as the formation of isis, it would be silly to blame America for that, let‚Äôs put blame for that where it needs to be, Islam, that is why isis exists, it‚Äôs the same reason the taliban existed/exists, why the mubjahdine before them existed and why so many times in history this group of people have done the exact same stuff. It would be like blaming Someone else for the klan, you can‚Äôt, the blame for that sits solely in the lap of white anglo Protestants.

For real? Islam? So Islam, that encompasses a quarter of the World population is the cause of extremism that for 90% of the time rises in war torn countries? What a damn coincidence. Where is the Extremism in Turkey? Or in Morocco? Peacefull countries, yet no trace of extremism, explain that.

ISIS is a direct result of the unjust Iraq-War that lead to a power vacuum. The Taliban is a direct result of Afghan war orphans that were tutored by uneducated Imams in Pakistani madrassas following an extremist Pakistani Sunni sect.

The Muhjuhadeen were a direct result on the aggression of the Russians in Afghanistan, you could call them Patriots. That's what they were, actual Afghan Patriots. See what nationalism leads to?

&gt;most of those Latin American countries were about to fall to soviet communism much like Cuba did, and Incase you didn‚Äôt know the Soviet Union was another epic oppressor.

So what if the people CHOOSE to follow a communist economic form? Why should the U.S. impose their will on the choice of the people? Isn't it a democracy? Lesser of 2 evils, tell that to Vietnam. Tell me, in what case was it really ""the lesser of 2 evils"". Tell me of one case.

&gt;but do you know why? It was to maintain stability and the relative peace that was and still is very very fragile.

Why are you talking in circles. First you're talking about attacking Iraq to bring ""freedom and democracy"" to the Iraqis and now you're saying that Sadam was need for peace and stability? If it were really so, why did the U.S. still wage war against him in the end? You're contradicting yourself.

&gt;most of the time it is because at the end of the day, we get the short end of the stick, or our elected representatives reject it, or it turns out that it isn‚Äôt in our best interest.

The only ""treaty"" I can think of is NATO where the U.S. is at the short end of the stick. The Paris Climate Agreement is a world wide effort to save the planet, the U.S. is just being greedy here. The Iran deal, litterally just the U.S. being the imperialist here while Iran is trying to handle this peacefully. Tell me where is the U.S. at the short end of the stick in any of these.

&gt;As far as your comment about America once being a beacon of freedom, it very much so still is, yeah yeah yeah we have our problems, that is true wouldn‚Äôt doubt it for a second, but still pound for pound the most free nation in the world, so yeah, we still have that going for us, bill of rights and what not. Feels good!

The U.S. has the highest incarceration rate in the world.

Students start their life with a debt, or else just not study at all and live their life in poverty from start. At least with a loan, they'll slowly descend into poverty.

You litterally only have the choice between 2 parties, slightly better than a 1-party system I admit. A right party and a far right party ... so much for democracy.

The Scandinavian countries and Switzerland (look up Swiss Direct Democracy) easily beats the U.S. when it's about being the most free nation and truest democracy in the World. Easily. After them comes the rest of Western Europe, you because we have the choice between more than 2 parties to govern the state and because regular people actually have the opportunity of being a politician without needing to be a damn millionair.

Sorry to pop you bubble though, but facts are facts.

I felt like the implication that our forefathers came legally did that, but that‚Äôs probably just a knee-jerk reaction on my part.

&gt;There was no law about it at.

There were countless broken treaties throughout westward expansion, and many violations of then-recent humanitarian statutes such as the Spanish [New Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Laws), not to mention murder, which was illegal on both sides.

Additionally, many acts of colonial separatism (the initial establishment of Puritan colonies, the independece of Puerto Rico, the American Revolution) were considered treasonous by the European countries which said colonists came from. 

&gt;[Asylum requirements]

I agree that your description of the requirements of asylum are legally valid, and believe the establishment of such requirements was a great step forward, but it seems that the current administration is hostile to making such ‚Äúcapitulations‚Äù as granting asylum, and I have read that they often do not give asylum seekers a chance to prove themselves.

But I honestly believe fully open border policies would be a more efficient, liberating and humane approach to immigration, and believe that border restrictions‚Äî while sometimes practical under our current arrangement‚Äî do more to restrict everybody‚Äôs freedom of movement than they do to actually promote security.

Yeah I'd say that the Caribbean as a whole is very suboptimal for something like a reactor. That doesn't mean they aren't significantly safer from environmental in extremely stable places (rural New England for example, or the vast majority of central/Western Europe). 


&gt;The earth has precisely zero evolved defenses to protect her biosphere from man made fissile material. 
&gt;
&gt;No.

First off I don't give a shit about ""the earth"", it's a rock, it's the biosphere that matters. As long as waste products are sufficiently isolated, treated, and properly disposed of, it's the least we can do. Even wind turbines and solar panels have harmful wastes associated with their production,but what we're really arguing about here is whether to stick to ""standard"" energy sources vs nuclear until 100% renewable can be achieved. 

The waste generated from some modern generators is pretty small in the grand scheme of things, and I legitimately worry more about the long-term signage (getting people in 10K years to know the risk) more than the environmental impact of something buried absurdly deep in an abandoned mineshaft in an already basically lifeless section of wasteland in the American SW.

Better than having to ship oil around oceans on a boat in the meantime anyway. 



Anyway, Gen IV reactors are still in the weird midpoint between research and planning for implementation, and they're the ones most worth implementing in terms of benefits vs drawbacks. If I had to choose between a new Natural Gas plant by my house or a planned Gen-IV reactor plant I know what I'd go for.

 Finding a remote hole to seal the waste in is difficult, but I sincerely believe that it'll do less harm to the biosphere sealed up at the bottom of a very deep mine shaft in the desert than a normal power plant that spews particulates and actual radioactive isotopes into the air. Seriously, look at the stats for radioactive emissions from ""normal"" gas/oil/coal plants vs nuclear. Until 100% renewable is viable nuclear is far better than gas/oil/coal. And even then there are some arguments to be made that it's less damaging to the biosphere/ecosystems than hydroelectric (aka flooding entire valleys and fucking up everything downstream) or biofuel (aka monoculture so we can make alcohol to burn).",True,False,False,,0,1559410599,,False,0,{},epqqnjx,False,t3_bvkjvp,False,False,t1_epqmdsr,/r/EarthStrike/comments/bvkjvp/how_do_you_feel_about_nuclear/epqqnjx/,False,,1568713837,3,True,[],False,EarthStrike,t5_r5ax8,r/EarthStrike,public,0,

As expected from arabs .

&gt;Also just because their great great grandfathers did something doesn't mean they should be held accountable for it. They weren't even born during that time period and many Arabs resent Western influence. It isn't the fault of the current generation for actions taken by the past. This is a barbaric way of thinking on your part.

Every nation is proud of what they have done doesnt matter if bad or good . In my culture what has your father done through his life affects peoples opinion of you . This means -at least in my culture- you are accountable .

&gt;I just said the Middle East was more stable under the Ottoman Empire. I think you need to take a serious chill pill and relax since this conversation isn't as serious as you think it is.

It really doesnt matter if im relaxed or not . This issue is already been solven . You trying to justify things doesnt change anything now .

&gt;Regardless, it wasn't only Turks ruling the Ottoman Empire; the Ottomans had a very diverse ruling class and complex notable system. The Turkish nationalist myth that the Ottoman Empire was a primarily Turkish endeavor has been debunked several times over the years.

Oh hell no . Ottoman sultans were Turkish and raised by Turkish culture . They still kept Sel√ßuk traditions . And not many padi≈üahs were religious . However the ruling class just like you said were filled people from BALKANS which were taken as children from their homes and raised by Turkish families and converted to islam . 

&gt;And it's not like Arabs waited for a prophet to fix their problems given that they revolted in the first place. If Arabs are anything they certainly aren't compliant.

They are always looking for a easy way out . ALWAYS . Even if it means being an american/russian/french/british puppet.

&gt;Iran isn't Arab and neither is Israel so clearly you don't have the best grasp as to what's going on in the Middle East.

Can agree with ƒ∞ran but they are just shia arabs . But israel has many arab citizens and they control Gaza strip so this makes them some kind of arab country .


&gt;Considering how little Arabs actually fought in the Arab Revolt compared to the thousands who fought for the Ottoman Empire I think that is a huge misconception in it of itself.

Considering how many Turks fought in the war miniatures arabic contrubitions .

&gt;I find it ironic that you criticize Arabs for being too trusting of Europeans and then go on to say that you would rather trust a European than an Arab.

They do good deals when you are smart and not desperate . And they act pragmaticly . They dont do stupid shit which leads them to misery .

&gt;This is why its necessary to understand that not all Arabs participated in the Revolt. The Arabs who did were weak shiekhs like (at the time) the Sauds or Hashemites who were tempted by promises of power from the British. 

Those shieks controlled huge tribes . Not like a only 1 old man did all of it .

Yeah I disagree with that completely. The SPD has been this big for so long because of the historical significance of the working class and worker dynamics. The problem is, these both are changing, rapidly.

For example the Agenda reforms were unpopular, yes, but absolutely necessary because of the nature of the changing labor market. The SPD knows that, too. The problem is that the policies that are necessary and good now and in the future are not social democratic, and social democratic policies may be popular among the traditional SPD electorate but they're simply not good.

&gt;Besides, if anything the Strukturwandel and the new service precariat necessitate a decisively pro-worker party more, even as a collective ""working class"" identity dwindles in importance.

Yeah that's a hard disagree from me.

I remember in something like 2011 I was sitting in a FES presentation with Lars Klingbeil, that was about the changing nature of the labor market and ways to deal with the rise of the gig economy and the increasingly necessary liberal reforms of the extremely rigid german labor market. It was mostly about ideas like a UBI and other ways of having social insurance programs that are flexible and able to deal with people changing jobs every two years.

None of that made it into the parties program or even its rhetoric. Because that's not what the SPD is about. Its whole core is about your work as your identity.

And that is not compatible with the future. The idea of having one job for 40 years is dead. The gig economy is coming, whether we like it or not. People will change jobs every two years.

But the SPDs constituency doesn't want to accept that, and those who do shift over to the Greens, because the Greens are much better prepared to deal with thse developments.

&gt;The FDP is going into a very wrong direction currently, but it has some social liberal seeds in its pro-European and its Young wings that will hopefully blossom over time.

&gt; An explosion at a factory in the Russian city of Dzerzhinsk has left 19 people injured, local media report.

&gt; A factory official says five people were inside at the time of the blast, and they had been safely evacuated.

&gt; A spokesman from the local emergency ministry told Russian news agencies that there was a &amp;quot;Technical explosion&amp;quot; in one of the workshops, which caused a fire of around 100 sq m. Last April three people died in another factory blast in Dzerzhinsk, which is believed to be one of the world&amp;#039;s most polluted cities.

"" One necessary precondition was mass politics. As a mass movement directed against the Left, fascism could not really exist before the citizenry had become involved in politics. Some of the first switches on the tracks leading to fascism were thrown with the first enduring European experiments with manhood suffrage following the revolutions of 1848. 62 Up to that time, both conservatives and liberals had generally tried to limit the electorate to the wealthy and the educated‚Äî‚Äúresponsible‚Äù citizens, capable of choosing among issues of broad principle. After the revolutions of 1848, while most conservatives and cautious liberals were trying to restore limits to the right to vote, a few bold and innovative conservative politicians chose instead to gamble on accepting a mass electorate and trying to manage it ""  


"" Unlike conservatives and cautious liberals, fascists never wanted to keep the masses out of politics. They wanted to enlist, discipline, and energize them. In any event, by the end of World War I, there was no possible turning back to a narrow suffrage. Young men almost everywhere had been summoned to die for their countries, and one could hardly deny the full rights of citizenship to any of them. Women, too, whose economic and social roles the war had expanded enormously, received the vote in many northern European countries (though not yet in France, Italy, Spain, or Switzerland). While fascists sought to restore patriarchy in the family and the workplace, they preferred to mobilize sympathetic women rather than disfranchise them, at least until they could abolish voting altogether ""

Italian serie is also not very comparable to NALCS, there's a very factual and easy to point out, lack of high caliber, NA players. Not only are they lacking as of now, but there's also no showing of a consistent system thats in place to groom any potential talent into better players.

(Meaning NA as a region can't just sit and wait, hope that someone will show up, they have to actively approach and train the talents themselves, because the talent pool isn't big enough.)   

But imports in NALCS are a direct result of lacking firepower, rather than the other way around, that there are star players simply so good, they must take spots. Because a lot of imports aren't even considered star talent when compared to their own region.

You can have profitable markets which aren't healthy (e.g. US healthcare), you can have healthy markets with few competitors (e.g. natural monopolies like airplane construction) and you can have markets with multiple competitors which aren't profitable (e.g. all of those scooter start-ups we're seeing everywhere).

You're creating a false binary choice without backing it up in anyway.

Would you say the energy market (excluding renewables) is currently healthy, competitive and without subsidy? Ignoring the externalities created by CO2 emissions is in effect a subsidy, having 'must run' generators like nuclear isn't a competitive market as you've described. The recent ruling by the EU on the UK capacity market is an example where fossil fuels were seen to be having an unfair advantage over cleaner solutions such as DSR.

As we know, in the event political union was to remain a dream: coups and internal crisis soon pre-occupied their leaders‚Äô energies. But as Peron‚Äôs biographer, Joseph Page\* surmised: ‚ÄúPeron was the only Latin leader willingly to promote union vigorously and he did so until the day he died.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; Peron was trying to do for South America what Mosley was trying to do for Europe. That surely would have been the major topic for discussion at the secret meeting of Peron and Mosley: one on which they would have been in complete accord.
&gt; 
&gt; The two men continued to keep in touch for years to come though it has not been confirmed if they ever met again. But even as I write these words a letter signed by Peron in exile addressed to Mosley‚Äôs office has appeared for sale on the Internet which reads: ‚ÄúI see now we have friends in common whom I greatly value, something which makes me reciprocate even more strongly your expressions of solidarity‚Ä¶I offer my best wishes and a warm embrace.‚Äù -signed Juan Peron, Hotel Pinar, Malaga, Spain, 20 February 1960.
&gt; 
&gt; Oswald Mosley and Juan Peron came from entirely different backgrounds but they shared many core beliefs. They both advocated the ‚ÄòThird Position‚Äô in economics. They both wanted to unite their continents and envisaged that European civilisation, values and culture would undergo a historic renaissance. And although when cornered they would fight like Lions, they would both go to any lengths consistent with honour to avoid bloodshed and war.

I, like everyone else, is barred from any facts by the MEDIA MONOPOLY. 

If I happen to know a fact, but due to widespread propaganda, 99% of the country thinks differently, what good is the fact? 

Suppose it were 1933, and we live in Germany, and I'm trying to tell Germans the ""facts"" about Hitler. What good would that do considering the media in Germany is entirely monopolized by Nazis?

Suppose it were 1500, and we lived in Medieval Europe, and I was trying to tell the ""facts"" about the Plague, or about Heliocentrism. Again, with a virtual media monopoly in place, the ""facts"" fall most on deaf ears, and anyone privy to them is subject to witch-hunt style persecutions. 

&gt; ... turn off the TV and actively seek information ...

I don't watch TV, but why would ""watching TV"" be an issue whatsoever, unless it was propaganda in the first place? Do you think the ""facts"" can overcome propaganda fueled by technology? If so, why hasn't this ever happened before in history?

1. That website has a clear bias and vested interest to actively make shariah look worse. Clearly the Mackenzie institute is probably a pro feminism or the kind of people who say stuff like ""All muslims want shariah and they want to oppress us and they want to make canada into a shariah state"" so take the entire thing with a grain of salt.
2. This institute is a conservative leaning one. If you look at some of its top staff their ex military who have ana active incentive to give a slanted view. They partner with counties like Israel and the USA aswell which further highlights their bias. Even their motto ""protecting Canadian security interests"" I think it was, is a phrase that gives off the vibe that if were writing about you in a negative tone on our website you are not compatible with our nation and our culture.

3. Now that I've debunked that article as a legeimtate source (not once has it quoted the actual Quran or Hadith where the Shariah stems from but instead just giving newspaper reports when sources are even given) let's first talk about college board. Now college board is a corporation that quite simply is left leaning. An example of this is the upcoming adversity score that there adding to the sat which directly challenges the idea of meritocracy and is trying to give less privileged (mostly non whites ) a leg up. This a recurring theme in college board as they attempt to be politically correct. You must have noticed how much they put down White Europeans in History papers continuously pointing out all the atrocities done by the white man against the helpless non white. This to avoid getting sued aswell by some individual belgoning to an minority who feels their being discriminated against if something overtly bad is said about there culture. (This is all just opnion.)

4. If you want to explain the actual historical argument for why were right just comment saying to do that aswell (it includes but not limited to: historical context of the time period, what sharia actually is, how sharia affected a womans positon in court of law and nature of the drawing and other options.

5. Now while writing this I noticed someone saying that they were quite positive that it did say equality, now even IF I am mistaken and you are right my dear sir about this you are mostly likely still wrong about the answer. The nature of sharia law in regards to the court and womans right is a complex topic. I will not delve into exact quotations and examples of how there was an extreme degree of equality and even if there wasn't in any case, (dont trust that article please it's like if the AK party in Turkey wrote an arrival about an segment in the bible √óD) the important thing to remember here is the historical context of the time period and the different interpretations of equality. Simply put, the relative position of Islamic woman under TRUE sharia law comapred to Christian woman in the early medieval era.

[],amitoughenouss,1536038985.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_24tfwz69,False,"I see the a life but I‚Äôm not sure which of you it is for. It‚Äôs a man, he is wearing very torn and raggy clothes but they used to be nice.  It‚Äôs really cold and he is somewhere among sparse trees and possible a frozen lake. The trees are bare and black but the season is just barely beginning to change so the ice on the trees has thawed a bit each day but refrozen at night. Because of this the trees are wet and the little branches are covered in blobby drippy ice that is very clear. He‚Äôs lost. There is a deep sense of regret and disappointment. Like he is a tiny part of something much larger but he feel like all the bad things that have been done to benefit the bigger thing have ultimately been ineffective. I think I see an old musket. And there is something behind him. Not visually but something still and frightening he is tying to get away from. And there is a threatening, almost stingy smell in the air. 
I hear nothing. No birds, no voices. He is just sitting by an attempt at a fire that isn‚Äôt lighting because all the wood is covered in ice. 
There‚Äôs a little metal cup. It‚Äôs a metal I don‚Äôt know. Very dull and silvery in color but darker than stainless steel and when I look at it I can hear his memory of the dead clunk noise it makes when a spoon hits it. Almost a wooden noise. 
I don‚Äôt know what that means. 
His name is something with an A. 
Ambrose I want to say. Or Abarse. I don‚Äôt hear any talking so I don‚Äôt know the language. 
But he has learned something that demoralized him in such a profound way he has decided to just sit there until he dies. I think there are dead bodies behind him. Lots of them. He didn‚Äôt kill them. He walked for days and finally came upon them. All frozen and twisted. Not even animals had eaten them. They have rifles or muskets. I don‚Äôt know what they are. But they don‚Äôt look modern. I  uniforms. They‚Äôre faded blue with pockets on the chest and some have black hats with white on top. 

I see another life too. Again, I don‚Äôt know whose it is because you‚Äôre both in the picture. But I see a woman in a sort of curled bonnet rushing through skinny filthy streets between brown buildings. There is disgusting stuff in the streets. It smells sweet in a rotten way but there is an additional smell, it‚Äôs a choking thick smell of putrefying meat. Her foot slips in a black blob but as she slides on it the black surface breaks and it‚Äôs deep red underneath. It looks like an organ. I think this is behind a butcher shop and she has stepped in discarded offal that has been left there to rot. 
She is running away from someone. No. A few people. They aren‚Äôt actively chasing her but they want her to do something she doesn‚Äôt want to. They expect her to stay in  an unsafe place in a house that is even more unsafe because it is her responsibility. Everyone is dying. It‚Äôs not English I‚Äôm hearing. She is thinking words but I don‚Äôt know them. It‚Äôs a sort of lilting language, almost bouncy and I don‚Äôt hear any sharp noises. No hard j or k sounds. It‚Äôs not a language I directly recognize. 
She thinks she shouldn‚Äôt go that way. That‚Äôs where the first person died. But maybe it‚Äôs safe there now? She doesn‚Äôt know how it works. Just that one person gets sick and then everyone else starts to die. The stink of the town is overwhelming. The air feels sticky. They‚Äôve stopped doing anything with the dead people anymore. She thinks if she can just get to a safer town, further away she will be okay. Somehow she knows she hasn‚Äôt caught it yet. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs plague she is running from. But that‚Äôs not what she calls it. ‚ÄúBayarto‚Äù Maybe? I have a hard time writing out the words I hear in different languages. 
Someone is ill at home. Someone who has always looked after her. But she knows nobody survives so she can‚Äôt do anything to help. 
I see her a few days later. She is out of the bad area except she is starting to feel the disease attack her. She falls against a tree in anguish and says something ‚Äúarayas‚Äù is sounds like. I don‚Äôt know 


I see another life too. Someone is drinking out of a metal cup with chipped paint. The paint is black with white speckles. 
They‚Äôre coming out of a blue tent into damp cool air. The world outside the tent is full of trees that are covered in moss. There‚Äôs mist along the ground and fog high above the trees. They‚Äôre giant redwoods. Someone is missing. It‚Äôs not your person who is missing. You‚Äôre just here to help look. You have begun to think they won‚Äôt be found alive. Someone found blood yesterday. ‚ÄúProbably animal blood‚Äù they reassured a nervous person but you don‚Äôt think so. They shouldn‚Äôt have been out here alone. Don‚Äôt they know it‚Äôs dangerous. 
There‚Äôs a little stream a ways below. You think Beth is down there. The person you‚Äôre looking for is called Beth. The other people looking for her say she wouldn‚Äôt have know there was stream there so wouldn‚Äôt have gone. But you know animals  know the river is there and if she did die some part of her may have been dragged towards the river by an animal. 
Nobody wants to hear your opinion.
You don‚Äôt care. You‚Äôve found people alone before. 
She is down there you can see her. It looks like she fell. She is all broken. You approach and begin talking. You think she is dead. You say out loud, ‚ÄúThis is why we don‚Äôt go wandering around alone in the woods drunk and in high heels now isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù You have to be sarcastic and detached otherwise you‚Äôll think about her family waiting with everyone else at the edge of the woods. 
Her dress is covered in mud. Bright red satin. One shoe heel is broken, so is her leg, so is her other leg. You‚Äôre sure she is dead. It‚Äôs too bad. She is pretty. And only
A little younger than you. If she were alive. If it were allowed. If you wouldn‚Äôt be demonized for feeling that way you could have asked her to dinner. You feel a connection to this pretty girl. 
You begin looking for a foothold to Camilo back up and tell the others you found her but the ground is moist and you slip and bump her slightly. You‚Äôre sure she can‚Äôt be alive, she has been out here for days but she just moved when your shoe hit her. You jump down and lean close to verify, she‚Äôs breathing and makes a little ‚Äúmmm‚Äù noise. 
You yell up that you found her. You‚Äôre screaming that you found her and she is alive but no one can hear you. 
You reassure her that she is going to be okay and that you‚Äôll be right back. 
You run back, making careful note of where you are. You tell her parents and the police. 
She is in the hospital for a long time. She will never walk properly again. But she‚Äôll survive. 
You want to visit her but you know that would be socially inappropriate. 
You keep thinking about the sarcastic comment you made when you thought she was dead. You also keep thinking about how pretty she is and how she makes you want to break rules to be bear her. 
The police person you are friends with tells you she asked to see the person who found her. 
You visit. 
She smiles at you the way you imagine her smiling at a boy. 
She wants to be friends with you. Pretty girls don‚Äôt usually want to be friends with you. Nobody wants to be friends with you because of what people say. They say you‚Äôre too masculine, too ambitious, that a woman should raise a family. You‚Äôve never wanted to raise a family but you would with Beth. You‚Äôre infatuated with her instantly and you think she likes you. 

This is the weirdest thing I‚Äôve ever experienced with one of these visions because I think you‚Äôre both in it. 
I think one of you is Beth and the other is the one who found her. 

I could be getting confused because it‚Äôs two people in one picture and it‚Äôs hard to tell what I‚Äôm seeing. But I don‚Äôt know. Maybe you have known each other in past lives. 

I also see somewhere I‚Äôve never seen before. It could be somewhere between Eastern Europe and Asia? 
The people have wide faces and dark hair and they speak a clumpy language. Full of round vowel sounds and lots of sh ch, and zh noises. I see a little hut and a someone wearing a red yellow and white knitted hat. There is a fire in the middle of the house. And the smoke goes up into the roof and leaks out the sides. It‚Äôs meant to do that. That‚Äôs what keeps something...it‚Äôs a word. I don‚Äôt know the word. ‚ÄúWozh ha‚Äù maybe? But the smoke is what keeps it from eating the roof.  ‚ÄúWozh ha‚Äù are small. Your grandmother stomps on them so I‚Äôm guessing bugs or mice. There is a stone on the fire and a pot on the stone. There are antlers in the corner and a skin drying on the other side of the fire. I see roots in the pot. They are skinny blackish purple roots. i think I‚Äôm seeing through your eyes. (Whichever one of you this is) because I know the roots taste very strong and bitter, but they are good with the meat from the animal with the antlers. The meat is dark red, almost purple. There are many of them outside. Your family raises the animals, eats the meat and drinks their milk. Your father makes hides and carves things out of antlers. You like the milk. It‚Äôs sweet and frothy. Your grandmother makes it sour by leaving it and jugs for the winter. 
You‚Äôre very small. 
You sit on the floor and play with the antlers. You watch your mother and your father‚Äôs mother make the soup, and tend to the animals with antlers. When your father comes home he has ice on his eyelashes. And you like to watch it melt away.

In practice that would not work. There is no realistic way a Maltese candidates can compete with a French, German or Italian candidates when it comes to EU wide publicity. It wouldn't be truly representational, since people wouldn't be equally exposed to candidates from all countries. Electoral districts are meant to balance this kind of skewing which would happen.

I mean, Alexander Stubb tried to be the EPP lead candidate instead of Manfred Weber. Stubb is definitely much more qualified. He has been a prime minister, financial minister, foreign minister and an EU minister. He also has been a MEP, and in addition to being a politician, as a doctor of political science he has an extensive academic career publishing about EU politicis.

But as CDU and Merkel pushed for Weber, he became the lead candidate of EPP, since Weber got much more publicity than Stubb, who is from a small EU country.

With no national borders for elections this effect would increase in EP.

&gt;The European Parliament should represent the people, not the countries. Those are already represented by the councils.

That's like saying EP should represent the people not EU.

In EU elections people can vote wherever they live. German citizen in Sweden can vote a Swedish candidate in Sweden.

All theoretical models are born out of a specific time and place, and built on a set of assumptions. This doesn't mean that theory shouldn't be applied in other contexts, but it does mean that we have to be attentive to the ways that the assumptions of certain frameworks aren't necessarily true when you move them out of a European context. 

For example, there are several studies of Foucauldian biopolitics in China. Biopolitics is a great tool to think with, but it is also built on assumptions about the power of the sovereign in pre-modern France. If you want to use Foucault to talk about China, you need to address the ways in which some elements of biopolitics don't actually work in this context. Another, perhaps better strategy, is to  include the arguments of critical theorists in Asia, whose writings on biopolitics are better attuned to the historical specificities of your study. This doesn't mean cutting out Foucault all together -- one advantage of including him is that it makes your work legible to a lot of other scholars working outside of your field. But the problem of relying on Foucault exclusively often means trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.

* Some gba games look bad on backlight devices, because they were made for the original non-backlight gba-screen.
* To fix this, get a patch from the ""List of the patches"" below and use the [online patcher](https://www.romhacking.net/patch/) patch your rom.
* You can play the patched roms on emulators or on a Game Boy using a flashcard.

# Color restoration patches:

For everyone that is playing on a Game Boy with backlight or with an emulator. I suggest to check out the ""color restoration patches"" to make a lot of GBA games look much better. The picture shows a few differences for some of the games.

# Background info:

The original Game Boy Advance not only had no backlight, but it also was a bad/very dark screen compared to other non backlight displays.Many games were released with brighter colors to accommodate this. But on a backlight screen these colors now often look too bright. Some people took a lot of effort to fix this for some games.

# You will need:

1. The rom file of the game you want to patch (rom-links not allowed here).
2. The color-patch for the game (check the list below).
3. I suggest using the [online patcher](https://www.romhacking.net/patch/):You only have to choose the ""ROM file"", choose the ""Patch file"" and click ""Apply patch"", then you get a download for the patched file.The online patcher supports ips, ups and aps patches and it even can read zip files directly. But if it is ever down you can use an offline program like [Lunar IPS](http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/240/).

# List of the patches:

[Blackthorne](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/3615/)

[Breath of Fire](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/2900/)

[Breath of Fire 2](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/902/)

[Castlevania Harmony of Dissonance](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/677/) (only removes the glowing outlines)

[Donkey Kong Country](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/4051/)

[Final Fantasy VI](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/765/)

[Final Fight One](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/2910/)

[Mother 1](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/2695/)

[SMA4 Super Mario Bros. 3](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/3315/)

[The Lost Vikings](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/3581/)

That is all I found. If you have more, comment and I will add it to the list.

# Why not download the patched rom?

* **Linking roms is not allowed:** Linking to roms is not allowed on many sites (including reddit).So please don't ask for it in the comments.Patching is really easy and normally takes less then a minute of your time. The online patcher should even work from most mobile phones.
* **Don't miss updates:** Some patches could still get updates. Some quite often. But I also have seen patches updated after 10 years of pause. Romhacking updates their entries.This is why I suggest (also for other hacks, translations etc.) to always search for the patch itself instead of a direct download for the patched rom.If you find this thread in your bookmarks or via reddit/google search in some years you have very high chances to still find the newest version of the patch via the links in the list.

# Patched rom doesn't work?

* **Make sure that the patch matches the region of your rom.** Some links contain patches for different regions (E=europe, U=USA, J=japan).Some links may only have a patch for one region; So it is possible that you can only get an english version if only an USA patch is available.
* If it still doesn't work; **Find out the checksum of the game:** There still can be different versions of a rom of the same region.  The entries on romhacking should show the checksum for the needed rom version for CRC32, MD5 and SHA-1.Get a checksum program for one of them and see if  your unpatched rom checksum matches the one, stated in the romhacking entry.The [online patcher](https://www.romhacking.net/patch/) automatically shows you the checksums after uploading the rom.

# Play on real hardware:

The patched games linked here should all run on any modern flashcard for gba. If you have Game Boy with a backlight screen, I suggest getting an ""EZ flash omega"" or an ""Everdrive GBA"".

I you haven't looked into flash cards yet, look at [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gameboy/comments/bmkyig/gba_flash_cart_comparison_everdrive_gba_x5_vs_ez/) for a comparison or search for the two names on r/gameboy.

# My thoughts:

It is a bit sad, that because of the decision of Nintendo, to dont give the forst gba a backlight, still affects us today.Having no backlight for the old Game Boy was the right decision. On the GBC it was questionable.

But imo in 2001 the technology was advanced enough to release a backlight device and still making it not to power hungry or expensive.

Good that some people created patches for some of the games.

Making the patches often is a lot of work. I think there were hundreds of hours spend to create some of the patches. One exception is [SMA4 Super Mario Bros. 3](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/3315/):

&gt;Unlike the other palette hacks for GBA games, where hackers had to put  in the time and dedication to restore the original SNES palettes, Super  Mario Bros. 3 actually already includes the original palette, which is  enabled when playing on a Game Boy Player. This hack simply forces the  GBP palette to be used at all times.

Nearly all the games in the list, are ports of other systems.  I think there are two reasons for that:

* Completely new developed games could use better color combinations for the dark screen, so that you did not need to make everything too bright. Ports on the other hand only could bright everything up and often looked worse. Also if you have something to compare it too, you see it more. So they needed a fix more badly.
* With a port available and with the help of some programs it is a lot easier to create such a patch.

[Castlevania HoD](https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/677/) is the only not ported game in the list, so it isn't a restoration patch. The patch here only removes the glowing outlines, which also were implemented because of the dark original GBA screen.

I haven't played all the games in the list, but I think Donkey Kong Country makes the biggest difference. The normal game not only looks to bright. In many places it uses completely different and strange colors.

The author of the DKC1 patch doesn't have the time to make a patch for DKC2 and DKC3, but he might release the tools he made for DKC1, which could help other people, who are interested in doing them.

I didn't initially realize that he was only player *not* on the provisional roster called up, but the point still stands that with his stock rising so much Berhalter may want him in a full MNT to get a look at him for the future. It may be something where the MNT and U23 coaches are deciding on if Yueill will play with one team or both teams in the future.

Berhalter sees this match as more an evaluation of the general player pool whereas the friendly vs Venezuela on the 9th will be the final Gold Cup tuneup. [""The game against Jamaica will represent an opportunity for us to evaluate new prospects as well continue to develop the group for the Gold Cup.

&gt; And what makes this roster not the final roster? 

It's not the final roster because they already have certain players as locks and others are still fighting for a spot. 

&gt; Wasn't JT Marcinkowski on one of the rosters?

JT was called up to a dual MNT/U23s camp that featured players who weren't currently starting with their clubs or had just finished their season in Europe.

&gt; Is he [Yueill] just showing up for the pre-Gold Cup friendly, then heading back to San Jose? 

Yes, as far as I can tell. He basically gets to stay in DC for awhile longer, train with the MNT if not play for them, and then will head back to SJ

Historical linguistics can only go back about  as far as currently accepted proto-languages; so around ~15,000 years, at the top end. There are some disagreements about particular dates and particular families, but you're not going to get anywhere near the time period that language was developing. There are no prominent monogenetic vs. polygenetic theories in historical linguistics because it's outside the scope of the field.

Anthropology can tell us some - not much - about the evolution of linguistic capabilities (e.g. the evolution of the larynx). But this has no connection to the origin of *specific *languages*. Population genetics may be able to tell you more about relationships between populations beyond the time depth that historical linguistics can uncover, but this again doesn't tell you about the languages that those people spoke.

&gt; A local health ministry statement says: &amp;quot;According to the latest information, 79 people asked for medical help after the explosion at Kristall: 38 factory workers and 41 residents of the city. There are no children among the injured.""

&gt; Officials said it was a &amp;quot;Technical explosion&amp;quot; in one of the workshops, which caused a fire of around 100 sq m. Last August three people died in another factory blast in Dzerzhinsk, in central Russia, which is believed to be one of the world&amp;#039;s most polluted cities.

In the first place, there were just Christians in general, but they started arguing over what really counted as real Christianity and some of them split off. Now you have multiple groups who all nominally follow the same religion, but have different names.

The big one was called the Protestant Reformation. At that point, the only major religion in western Europe was Catholicism, but it had gotten super tied in with politics in Italy and corruption was rampant. The big issue that comes into play with this explanation is that the Catholic Church didn‚Äôt like the idea of ordinary people reading the Bible by themselves, and they wanted everyone to just listen to the priests instead. The Protestants encouraged people to study and learn instead of just listening to the priests, who could become corrupt. 

Over time, the name Protestant became less of a religion and more of a term to refer to a variety of sects that originated from that movement. The ideals they started out with changed over time, and specifically the ideal of really studying the Bible to learn the messages fell away, and people have mostly gone back to just listening to the leaders of whichever church they decide really clicks with them. So that gives you a bunch of people who just parrot the vague major concepts and know they don‚Äôt agree with other sects entirely, but don‚Äôt know why. 

Back to the direct topic of sex before marriage, some of those sects believe that the rules laid out in the Bible were written for a specific reason at the time and don‚Äôt always still apply. For example, literally no branches of Christianity still practice stoning, and that was all over the Bible.  Different sects agree with different rules. Pretty much all of them say you should at least try not to have sex before marriage, but not all of them are incredibly serious about it. People break smaller religious rules all the time, and even the bigger ones. (The Ten Commandments are the ones everyone agrees on, and people still can‚Äôt even follow all of them.) 

Regarding different versions of the Bible,  you have to consider the origins of it- a series of books written in languages that are no longer actively spoken. Translation is more of an art than a science, so you can get a lot of different results from different translators. They all follow the overall story, so most people don‚Äôt get too up in arms over which translation to use outside of academic contexts.

One of the first points he made repeatedly early on was that Marx hijacked the term and redefined it to mean ""worker/collective ownership of the means of production."" He refers to this concept over and over again as Jewry. And that Marx was a Jew who was incapable of understanding socialism in a nationalist context because Jews (at that time) didn't have a homeland.

Socialism as the Agrarian Aryan society was the ideal of Hitler and the Nazis. So Socialism in the long-term sense was an Agrarian society built by Aryans. But Socialism in the immediate sense (the 1930's) also meant devotion to the current German/Aryan Community.

Nazi Law theorist Gottfried Neesse defined it this way.

""The nation is the complete agreement between organism and organization, the perfect formation of a naturally grown being. ... Nationalism is nothing more than the outwardly directed striving to maintain this inner unity of people and state, and socialism is the inwardly directed striving for the same end.""

Hitler's short-term goal was to mobilize German industry to re-arm Germany and prepare for  the conquest of Eastern Europe for farmlands and living space. He gave the German Capitalists plenty of incentives to support his plans (including bribery). He even purged the SA and Ernst Rohm (who advocated worker ownership of the means of production).

So during the war period, Socialism generally meant total devotion and sacrifice of a German individual to the cause of the German community. When, after they purged the Jews, cultivated Eastern Europe, and established their Agrarian society, they would then achieve their ideal Socialist system.

According to their racial theories, Jewish influence in German capitalism and influence in labor unions is what lead to exploitation and class warfare.

The Madagascar Plan was a proposal by the Nazi German government to relocate the Jewish population of Europe to the island of Madagascar. Franz Rademacher, head of the Jewish Department of the German Foreign Office, proposed the idea in June 1940, shortly before the Fall of France. The proposal called for the handing over of control of Madagascar, then a French colony, to Germany as part of the French surrender terms.

The idea of re-settling Polish Jews in Madagascar was investigated by the Polish government in 1937, but the task force sent to evaluate the island's potential determined that only 5,000 to 7,000 families could be accommodated, or even as few as 500 families by some estimates.

After nearly a year of work, we've finally got a relatively playable version of the dev branch! Here's a list of some of the new features and content:Happiness mechanic - As your colony grows from a quiet farming village to a bustling city, their demands increase. Feed them well and give them luxury items to keep them happy. Or don't, and watch your science speed &amp; productivity plummet while recruitment costs dramatically rise. Co-op - It's now possible to share a colony with friends! Dozens and dozens of new items and jobs - fishermen, cooks, diamonds, tea, coffee, silk, and last but not least, potatoes! Entirely new world generation - It uses a combination of temperature and ""rainfall"" (not visible, but a lush forest obviously has more rainfall than a desert) to determine what the area should look like.Three exotic regions - There's now a Far East, Tropics and New World, each with their own unique science, jobs and research!Multiple colonies mechanic - Craft a Colony Starter Kit and start new colonies. Glider - Research and craft a glider and take to the skies for rapid exploration and travel!Trading - Set up traders to sent items and science from one colony to another, or to other players in multiplayer. New Unity Version - Includes a multitude of updates which solve common problems Dramatic optimization - Terrain should load a lot quicker, and you ought to be able to have a lot of extra colonists!New save system - Savegames are 10 times smaller, making saving and loading 10 times as quick. They're also 10 times less likely to corrupt! It's also prepared to deal with the Steam Workshop.Easy co-op hosting - It's no longer necessary to browse through the installation folder and find a separate server. Set up a multiplayer server with friends right from the main menu! LAN support - By popular demand. Plenty of other small optimizations - You can now recruit as many colonists as you've got unfilled jobs or beds in one click, or enter a custom number. A lot of old and ugly hand drawn icons have been replaced with rendered icons. Some job blocks have been replaced as well. This is the most dramatic overhaul Colony Survival has ever had. 0.6.3 was highly polished and balanced - 0.7.0 is not like that. You should be able to have many hours of fun with the beta, but you will run into errors, missing content, highly unbalanced recipes and unfinished elements. But if you understand that and are still looking forward to testing 0.7.0 and sharing your experiences with us, we'd love to have you on board! We're planning to keep the Open Beta live until the definitive release of 0.7.0. Make yourself invaluable by sharing good and detailed feedback, and you'll be invited to future internal testing as well. Join the open beta by going to #introductions in our Discord and typing something like the following sentence with the appropriate info: ""@Developer @Admin I'm from , I'm  and have played CS for  and I'd like to help!""So it would look something like: ""@Developer @Admin I'm from Australia, I'm in my 20s and have played CS for 32 hours and I'd like to help!""""@Developer @Admin I'm from Europe, I'm 19 and have played CS for 12 hours and I'd like to help!""We'll check #introductions often and grant the Open Beta Tester role to anyone who posts the sentence there correctly. With the OB Tester role, you've got access to the Perpetual Testing Initiative category on Discord. Read #test-announcements to read how to get access to the 0.7.0-branch. You need to own the game on Steam to unlock it! We're all based in Europe, so there might be a gap in verifications somewhere between midnight and 9AM CET. We hope you'll try all the new features and report back about your experience. Screenshots and videos are welcome. You're allowed to share videos outside of the Discord, but we'd appreciate it if you make clear that it's a highly unfinished beta. Good luck testing and bedankt voor het lezen! Reddit // Twitter // YouTube // Website // Discord

&gt; Nine Inch Nails is an Industrial rock band that was formed in 1988 in Cleveland, Ohio, United States by Trent Reznor, the only constant member of the band. Reznor is generally credited for popularizing the genre known as ""industrial rock"" with both his releases and dark, theatrical music videos. As of 2016, the band also officially includes Reznor's longtime collaborator Atticus Ross as a second official member.

&gt; Born Michael Trent Reznor, he was raised by his maternal grandparents in Mercer, Pennsylvania, USA. Reznor took up piano at the age of five and in high school took up the tuba and saxophone. In the early to mid-80s, Trent played with various synthpop and new wave groups such as Exotic Birds and Option 30 before beginning his solo project. 

&gt; As a member of Exotic Birds, he appeared in the Michael J. Fox and Joan Jett  film Light of Day. He also was mentioned on local TV as a proponent of electronic music in general. Before the 1989 release of NIN's first album, 'Pretty Hate Machine', he worked for Right Track Studio as a handyman heavily interested in recording technology. Both the name of Reznor's band and the title of his second single, ""Head Like a Hole"", came from remarks by Al Jourgensen of Ministry, Reznor's biggest influence.

&gt; Nine Inch Nails has issued eight major albums, which have generally received both critical and commercial acclaim. Historically, NIN releases have been assigned a ""Halo"" index number. For example, the album 'With Teeth' is also known as Halo 19. With the inclusion of the 'Broken' EP, the band's primary releases are:

&gt; 1. 'Pretty Hate Machine' (1989)
2. 'Broken' EP (1992)
3. 'The Downward Spiral' (1994)
4. 'The Fragile (Left)' / ''The Fragile (Right)' (1999)
5. 'With Teeth' (2005)
6. 'Year Zero' (2007)
7. 'Ghosts I-IV' (2008)
8. 'The Slip' (2008)
9. 'Hesitation Marks' (2013)
10. 'Not the Actual Events' EP (2016)
11. 'Add Violence' EP (2017)
12. 'Bad Witch'  (2018)

&gt; Nine Inch Nails has also produced a number of EP's, remixes, and provided contributions to various movie soundtracks, including 'Lara Croft: Tomb Raider', 'The Crow', 'Natural Born Killers', 'Lost Highway', and 'Tetsuo: The Bullet Man'. Trent Reznor additionally provided the soundtrack for the massively popular id Software game Quake, a release inspired by ambient music. His team up with Atticus Ross resulted in the critically praised soundtrack to the film 'The Social Network', with the Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross duo winning an Oscar for Best Original Score at the 83rd Academy Awards

&gt; In 2002, a live album (their second live release, the first being the video 'Closure Documentary') entitled 'And All That Could Have Been' was released on DVD &amp; CD. The Deluxe version of the CD came packaged with a mini album called 'Still'. That release featured several previously released songs in a stripped down, near-acoustic format along with several other new compositions.

&gt; Nine Inch Nails as a live band is generally understood to be a separate entity from its recording studio-based component. Occasionally, past band members are invited to participate in the process when not directly involved with recording new material, Nine Inch Nails' lineup tends to change drastically between major tours. Aside from Trent Reznor remaining on lead vocals, nothing about the live band has remained constant since its inception. Reznor cited the long gestation period between studio albums as part of the reason for these frequent personnel changes.

&gt; Beginning in late 2005, the live band featured Aaron North on guitar, Jeordie White on bass guitar, Alessandro Cortini on keyboards, and Josh Freese on drums, though all occasionally performed with different instruments. This lineup toured Europe, Asia, Australia, and America through 2007. Trent Reznor reported that he would disband the ""rock band configuration"" of his touring lineup after their concert in Honolulu, Hawaii on September 18, 2007, and would explore other means to perform Nine Inch Nails material on subsequent tours. Despite this claim he has regained the rock group lineup for the 'Lights In The Sky Over...' tours with Robin Finck returning on guitar and Justin Meldal-Johnsen of Beck and other projects accompanying Cortini and Freese.

&gt; Past live band members include (listed chronologically):

&gt; * Ron Musarra: Drums, Samplers
* Chris Vrenna: Keyboards, Samplers, Drums
* Richard Patrick: Guitar
* Jeff Ward: Drums
* David Haymes: Keyboards
* Nick Rushe: Keyboards
* Lee Mars: Keyboards
* James Woolley: Keyboards
* Robin Finck: Guitar, Synthesizer
* Danny Lohner: Bass, Guitar, Synthesizer
* Charlie Clouser: Synthesizer, Drums on 5 songs during the Dissonance side of David Bowie's Outside tour, Theremin
* Sean Beavan: Soundboard, Backing vocals on 5 songs
* Jerome Dillon: Drums
* Alex Carapetis: Drums
* Ilan Rubin: Drums

&gt; The September 14, 2007 edition of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin reported that the September 18 show in Honolulu, Hawaii would be the last performance of the current incarnation of the Nine Inch Nails live band. Trent Reznor was quoted as stating, ""at this point, I want to switch things around a bit. Nine Inch Nails as a rock band configuration, we've done it and we've done it again. I see other ways I can present the material in concert, more challenging, something new. I don't want it to go stale.""

&gt; A DVD/Blu-Ray/HD-DVD of live material from the 2006 With Teeth tour was released in late February 2007 entitled Nine Inch Nails Live: Beside You In Time. All three formats include 24 songs from the summer and winter 2006 tours, plus bonus material.

&gt; Information about Nine Inch Nails concerts can be found on the NIN website.

&gt; Ghosts I-IV was released on March 2, 2008. It contains 36 instrumental tracks and was recorded in ten weeks of fall 2007. Initially intended to be a five-track EP, the album is presented in the form of four nine-track EPs. The tracks do not have names, and are only identified by their track listing and position on the EPs.  Ghosts I-IV also adds to the recent experimentation with digital distribution; the album is available in many different ways, including a digital download, for purchase or (partially) free, a CD set, and a deluxe edition set.

&gt; The eighth album called ""The Slip"" was officially released on May 5, 2008. The whole album can be downloaded for free from this website: Nine Inch Nails - The Slip

&gt; On February 16th 2009, Trent announced that he would begin his last tour. Nine Inch Nails would indefinitely end. However, it is not likely that this is the end of his music career. In his letter, he hinted that he may do something with Jane's Addiction. In addition, Reznor has said outright in an interview on the official website that he is not done making music as Nine Inch Nails, but that he is done touring.

&gt; Trivia:
 * Trent Reznor has worked with several big names in musical collaboration outside of NIN in recent years, including time rocker artist David Bowie, Maynard James Keenan of Tool, Zach de La Rocha of Rage Against the Machine, Peter Murphy of Bauhaus, Josh Wink, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, slam poet Saul Williams, hip-hop producer Puff Daddy &amp; The Family, Peter Gabriel, Henry Rollins and more recently, hip-hop producer El-P and Queens of the Stone Age.
 * Contrary to popular belief, Suck is technically a cover and not an original. The song was originally performed by the band Pigface on the album Gub (1991), a band which Trent worked with in the past. Trent is given vocal and writing credits and the song was later re-recorded for the Broken EP (1992) as a hidden track .
 * Legendary country star Johnny Cash covered Hurt on the album The Man Comes Around.

&gt; Richard Hawley (born Richard Willis Hawley, 17 January 1967, Sheffield, United Kingdom) is a critically-acclaimed guitarist, singer, songwriter and producer. Hawley initially found success as a member of Britpop band Longpigs in the 1990's, and formerly Treebound Story. When a drug-filled torpor after an extensive tour of America brought the band to the brink of extinction in 1997, Hawley was asked to play with Pulp by his close friend and Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker. ""They saved my life,"" Hawley later recalled, ""I was going mental with drink and drugs."" The subsequent world tour in support of Pulp's album This Is Hardcore left Hawley emotionally and physically drained on his return to his home city. During this time, he even considered leaving the music industry altogether.

&gt; It was an encounter at Hawley's Sheffield home that led the longtime collaborator out of the shadows. Impressed by a home demo of his songs, both Pulp's Jarvis Cocker and Steve Mackey urged Hawley to head into the studio and begin work on his first solo release. 2000's eponymous mini album encouraged Hawley to return to the studio once more. In 2001 Late Night Final, named after the cry of vendors selling the Sheffield Star evening newspaper on the streets of the city, was released to positive reviews from the press, if unspectacular sales. Two years later Hawley released Lowedges, another Sheffield reference, this time to the curiously named suburb of the city that had so entranced the young Hawley when he had seen it on the destination board of a bus. NME called Lowedges the ""first great album of 2003"" and it topped an end of year poll held by Virgin Radio.

&gt; In 2004 Hawley signed to Mute Records, a division of the giant EMI. Legal wrangling delayed Cole's Corner, Hawley's fourth release, until September 2005. Again Hawley mines the theme of his beloved home city, this time referencing the location where courting lovers meet. Cole's Corner eventually gained a nomination for the acclaimed Mercury Prize in 2006.

&gt; Hawley's work as a session musician and producer remains in high demand. After contributing towards her eponymous 2004 release, Hawley also supported Nancy Sinatra on her European tour in 2005. In the past, Hawley has also worked with artists as diverse as New York's A Girl Called Eddy, All Saints (he played the guitar solo on their cover of ""Under the Bridge""), Nellee Hooper's soundtrack for Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet and with Jarvis Cocker's Relaxed Muscle project.

&gt; Aside from his solo and session work, Hawley occasionally tours with The Feral Cats, a side project that enables him to explore his interest in rockabilly music.

&gt; Possibly due to his aforementioned rockabilly interest, Hawley once auditioned for the role as guitarist in the rockabilly-inclined Morrissey's band.

&gt; Fiercely proud of his working class upbringing, Hawley recently described himself as ""jurassic labour"" in response to a question about the New Labour project. He lives in Sheffield, with his wife and children and is an avid Sheffield Wednesday supporter.

&gt; In 2007 Hawley released a new studio album, Lady's Bridge (the title refers to a bridge Hawley regulary crosses in his native Sheffield) again to much critical acclaim.

&gt; Hawley's album Truelove's Gutter was released in September 2009 and followed that October by a UK nationwide tour. The album was nominated for, and won the Mojo record of the year.

&gt; Following the success of his award-winning, hugely acclaimed 2009 album 'Truelove's Gutter', Richard Hawley will release his sixth studio album, 'Standing At The Sky's Edge' - his first for new label Parlophone - on 7th May.

&gt; Recorded at Sheffield's Yellow Arch Studio in 2011, 'Standing At The Sky's Edge' marks a seismic shift in direction for Hawley. The album is a euphoric, sonic assault on the senses, channelling elements of psychedelia, space rock and ragas with heavy riffs and raw, visceral guitar solos - as well as more familiar, tender moments - which will surprise Hawley's fans and peers alike.

As for the equipment, weapons and such, we happily accept and not only would like to have military stability in such form but also ask for other things.

Such of which, we hope to formalize in a meeting with President Kalo and President Ocasio-Cortez but we will make our talking points clear here.

* Economic Advisors

Our economy is plummeting. Our public sector is diminished and our unemployment is one of the highest in the region, if not for one of the top-10 of Europe. We would like more insight and assistance from the United States in order to maintain capitalist, free-market trade and similar that will help corporations and small businesses finally flollack and grow in Kosovo.

* Military and Police Advisors 

As you stated here, we need training beyond what we currently have. The most effective tactics we historically have excelled are guerilla warfare against an enemy. Our weapon there was more the people than terrain. We would like to better ourselves, our police and military tactically and ethically. 

We also seek more DEA and FBI assistance in the country to help our ever-growing police force (the AZD, based heavily off the organization of the American DEA) in arming them in the ever-growing fight against smuggling and trafficking from human to drug.

* Political Advisors

We are always searching for ways to better ourselves, in search and pursuit of a more Perfect Union. We, since 2013, have been in locked in a situation with the situation agreed by the EU of Serb Municipalities and allowing the Serbian people in Kosovo some autonomy to govern themselves. However, this has come at some critique where majority Serbian-lands would be governing a minority Albanian and the same for majority Albanian-lands governing a minority Serbian. 

Both sides have stated it would be unfair and poorly representated. We listened. We feel the strongest and best decision is to reform the government entirely and seek a more perfect union in the form of a Federation of Kosovo, allowing all regions a portion of self-governance but also granting more power Federally in order to contain the threat of poor representative of minorities within certain regions. We are also not throwing out the idea of a Confederation but feel a Federation would be the best idea for both a solid set of separation and integration.

 Criadas pela Constitui√ß√£o de 1988 em substitui√ß√£o aos decretos-lei da ditadura, as MPs s√£o o principal instrumento do governo para legislar. Elas t√™m for√ßa de lei, mas precisam ser aprovadas em at√© 120 dias pelo Congresso para virarem, de fato, uma lei.

 As MPs s√£o fonte constante de cr√≠ticas de congressistas porque n√£o h√° limite ao seu uso pelo presidente, ocupam parte relevante da agenda do Congresso e, em alguns casos, n√£o atendem aos crit√©rios de relev√¢ncia e urg√™ncia exigidos pela Constitui√ß√£o.

 A tentativa de restringir o mecanismo conta com o aval de parte da c√∫pula da C√¢mara e do Senado e √© tratada em duas frentes.

 A mais importante delas est√° no Senado.

 No in√≠cio de abril foi apresentada uma proposta de emenda √† Constitui√ß√£o (PEC 43/2019), de autoria dos senadores Randolfe Rodrigues (Rede-AP) e Antonio Anastasia (PSDB-MG), que conta com a assinatura de 28 dos 81 integrantes da Casa.

 Ela est√° em an√°lise pela Comiss√£o de Constitui√ß√£o e Justi√ßa do Senado, que √© o primeiro passo da tramita√ß√£o, e estabelece regras dur√≠ssimas para o uso das medidas provis√≥rias.

 S√≥ cinco poderiam ser editadas pelo presidente a cada ano, e n√£o seria permitido que abordassem temas j√° tratados em projetos em tramita√ß√£o no Congresso.

 Uma das inten√ß√µes dos defensores da medida √© for√ßar o Pal√°cio do Planalto a conduzir suas propostas por meio de projetos de lei, que s√≥ passam a vigorar depois de cumprir toda a tramita√ß√£o no Congresso e serem sancionadas pelo presidente, ou encampar propostas de parlamentares j√° em tramita√ß√£o.

 Hoje n√£o h√° limite para a edi√ß√£o de MPs. S√≥ nos seus primeiros meses de mandato, Bolsonaro editou 14 medidas provis√≥rias. O n√∫mero √© menor do que o de Michel Temer (MDB) em igual per√≠odo de sua gest√£o (23), mas supera os de Dilma Rousseff (PT) nos cinco primeiros meses de seus dois mandatos --13 e 9, respectivamente.

 Sem uma base formal de apoio no Congresso, Bolsonaro tem encontrado dificuldade em fazer valer suas propostas.

 Na semana que passou, o governo conseguiu aprovar no Congresso a [MP que reduziu o n√∫mero de minist√©rios](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/05/senado-aprova-texto-base-de-mp-de-bolsonaro-situacao-do-coaf-ainda-e-discutida.shtml), mas perto do prazo de 120 dias e com altera√ß√µes, como a retirada do Coaf (Conselho de Controle de Atividades Financeiras) da al√ßada do Minist√©rio da Justi√ßa de Sergio Moro ‚Äîo √≥rg√£o fiscalizador voltou para a pasta da Economia.

 Randolfe diz que apresentou a proposta de emenda √† Constitui√ß√£o ap√≥s entendimentos com o presidente do Senado, Davi Alcolumbre (DEM-AP), de quem √© aliado.

 ""Eu apresentei a PEC ap√≥s di√°logo com o presidente do Senado e com outros l√≠deres. Tasso [Jereissati, do PSDB], Anastasia... N√£o conversei com o Maia [Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), presidente da C√¢mara], mas sei que existe simpatia na C√¢mara, inclusive do presidente Maia"", afirma Randolfe.

 De fato, a **Folha** ouviu de v√°rios deputados federais a afirma√ß√£o de que o tema √© uma de suas prioridades em 2019.

 Al√©m das tradicionais cr√≠ticas ao uso indiscriminado de MPs, v√°rios partidos querem dar uma resposta a Bolsonaro, que desde a transi√ß√£o tem estimulado um discurso considerado por esses parlamentares como de [criminaliza√ß√£o da tradicional atividade pol√≠tica](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2019/03/bolsonaro-diz-que-atritos-com-congresso-existem-porque-alguns-nao-querem-largar-a-velha-politica.shtml).

 Com base em conversas com empres√°rios e representantes do mercado, esses congressistas t√™m avaliado que o governo n√£o reuniu at√© agora capacidade real de governabilidade e que, nesse momento pelo menos, cabe ao Congresso tomar as r√©deas.

 Devido a isso, C√¢mara e Senado adotam uma esp√©cie de parlamentarismo branco, assumindo a linha de frente das reformas da Previd√™ncia e tribut√°ria, entre outras a√ß√µes.

 Apesar do clima favor√°vel, o texto que restringe as MPs deve sofrer oposi√ß√£o e provavelmente ser√° modificado.

 Relator da PEC na CCJ, o senador Esperidi√£o Amin (PP-SC) diz n√£o ter posi√ß√£o ainda sobre a ideia. Para ele, o principal problema das MPs √© o Congresso, n√£o o instrumento.

 ""Eu sou autor do texto que est√° em vigor. A Emenda Constitucional 32 [que proibiu a reedi√ß√£o indefinida de MPs n√£o analisadas], de 2001, √© proposta minha, copiando modelo de Santa Catarina. A pr√°tica de reeditar √© muito pior do que √© hoje. Hoje a culpa √© do Congresso, culpa nossa, porque a C√¢mara ret√©m [demora a votar as MPs e d√° pouco tempo de an√°lise ao Senado]"", diz Amin.

 Ele afirma que apresentar√° um relat√≥rio em tempo menor do que a C√¢mara gasta para votar uma MP. ""N√£o analisei, mas n√£o tenho nenhuma disposi√ß√£o a favor disso, a MP √© um instrumento regulado pela Constitui√ß√£o. Ainda n√£o tenho posi√ß√£o, mas n√£o tenho boa vontade"", afirma.

 Cabe a Amin apresentar um relat√≥rio que ser√° aprovado ou rejeitado pela CCJ, composta de 27 senadores titulares ‚Äî11 deles signat√°rios da PEC.

 A outra frente para modificar as regras de tramita√ß√£o das MPs est√° na C√¢mara, em outra PEC, a 70/2011.

 De autoria do ex-presidente da Rep√∫blica Jos√© Sarney (1985-1990), a proposta j√° foi aprovada no Senado e nas comiss√µes da C√¢mara, estando pronta para ser votada no plen√°rio. Ela, inclusive, esteve na pauta de vota√ß√µes da √∫ltima ter√ßa-feira, mas acabou n√£o sendo analisada.

 O texto tem como um dos objetivos estabelecer mecanismos para assegurar que o Senado tenha mais tempo para analisar as MPs ‚Äîhoje √© comum a C√¢mara esgotar praticamente todo o tempo de 120 dias de an√°lise e[ enviar as medidas para o Senado no limite do prazo.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/05/senado-nao-pode-ser-casa-carimbadora-diz-davi-alcolumbre-no-rs.shtml)

 De 1988 at√© 2001, o poder das medidas provis√≥rias era mais elevado. Elas podiam ser reeditadas sucessivamente caso n√£o tivessem sido analisadas pelo Congresso.

 Com a Emenda Constitucional 32, estabeleceu-se o prazo de at√© 120 dias para vota√ß√£o por deputados e senadores, per√≠odo ap√≥s o qual a MP perde a validade se n√£o tiver sido aprovada. A emenda tamb√©m proibiu a edi√ß√£o de MPs para temas como direito penal e processual civil, entre outros.

 Em 2009 a C√¢mara passou a adotar uma interpreta√ß√£o do ent√£o presidente da Casa, Michel Temer, que afrouxou a camisa de for√ßa no plen√°rio, que era impedido de votar outros temas caso houvesse MPs com o prazo m√≠nimo de an√°lise estourado --o chamado ""trancamento de pauta"", no jarg√£o legislativo.

 A partir de ent√£o, a Casa passou a entender ser v√°lida a vota√ß√£o, nessas situa√ß√µes, de projetos que n√£o poderiam ser objeto de MPs, como emendas √† Constitui√ß√£o.

  ### Entenda a quest√£o das MPs

 **O que √© uma medida provis√≥ria (MP)**

  * Principal instrumento que o governo federal tem para legislar, foi institu√≠da pela Constitui√ß√£o de 1988, em substitui√ß√£o aos decretos-lei da ditadura
 * S√≥ pode ser usada em casos de urg√™ncia e relev√¢ncia, mas o Executivo normalmente ignora essa exig√™ncia
 * Tem for√ßa de lei a partir de sua edi√ß√£o
 * Deve ser votada pelo Congresso, que pode modific√°-la, em at√© 120 dias. Caso contr√°rio, caduca
  **MPs editadas nos cinco primeiros meses de mandato presidencial**

  * Collor (1990-1992): 36
 * Itamar (1192-1994): 4
 * FHC 1 (1995-1998): 47
 * FHC 2 (1999-2002): 1
 * Lula 1 (2003-2006): 17
 * Lula 2 (2007-2010): 32
 * Dilma 1 (2011-2014): 13
 * Dilma 2 (2015-2016): 9
 * Temer (2016-2018): 23
 * Bolsonaro (2019 - ): 14
  **Bolsonaro j√° editou...**  
 mais MPs que Dilma no in√≠cio dos seus dois mandatos, mas menos que Lula e Temer

 **Emenda √† Constitui√ß√£o em 2001**  
 Estabeleceu prazo de an√°lise de 120 dias pelo Congresso e proibiu a reedi√ß√£o, no mesmo ano, de MPs rejeitadas ou que tenham caducado. Tamb√©m vedou a edi√ß√£o de MPs para temas como direito penal e processual civil 

 **O que prop√µe o projeto no Senado**

  * Limite de 5 MPs por ano
 * Veto √† edi√ß√£o de MPs sobre direito trabalhista
 * Veto √† edi√ß√£o de MPs para projetos de lei em tramita√ß√£o no Congresso
 * Perda da efic√°cia para MPs que n√£o sejam votadas em at√© 60 dias",True,False,False,,0,1559458963,,False,0,{},epspg5n,True,t3_bvut74,False,True,t3_bvut74,/r/brasilnoticias/comments/bvut74/proposta_quer_limitar_medidas_provis√≥rias/epspg5n/,False,,1568747267,1,True,[],False,brasilnoticias,t5_3a1qf,r/brasilnoticias,restricted,0,

1: Learn to play the weapons you lose against most. By doing this, you'll learn how those weapons are beaten, and areas they can't cover. Brawlhalla is fast-paced, so you'll have to 'feel' it, instead of just knowing it.

2: Learn fringe tech. By doing this, you'll get better control over your characters, by improving your input accuracy, thus allowing for better play. If you want any examples, just ask.

3: Learn to use 'general reads'. This means reading your opponent by thinking how most people react to certain moves. If, for example, you realise most people dodge in against scythe, you can just use that the first time you land a combo starter, leading to free damage. In plat, most people will switch up their dodging a bit, but eventually fall back into the same patterns. If you can figure those patterns out, you'll be good.

He's spot on to talk about power... and this is where I think there's an issue. A lot of people who voted to leave, feel a loss of power and this comes from many areas - competing in an EU not just British job market, industries now being optimally located within the EU not just British industry market so we see a general shift away from industry towards services, then there are cultural shifts where there is increased diversity and more variety could be perceived as a watering down/weakening of identity, and it involves influence of ideas and legislation in order to co-operate across the EU which again could be perceived as a loss of power.

&amp;#x200B;

So, then people who voted to remain, perhaps they are more likely to perceive these exact same things as a gain in power or maintenance of power into the changing future. This is why we get this impression of people viewing the same thing but coming up with two different realities. If we view it as 'leave = perception of a loss of power' and 'remain = perception of a gain in power' - I think this can help us feel more compassionate towards both sides. People generally get angry as part of the fight/flight response - so there's an anxiety or a loss or an attack being perceived and a general feeling of a loss of power would definitely explain the resulting hostility. blah blah... really interesting video.

2.  The British monopoly goes back to the early 16th century with Spanish and Portuguese dominating the trade with Asia they left Northern New Canaan alone as they thought it was too poor and Central/Southern New Canaan too difficult to profit from (minus the Colorado Culture who the Spanish discovered).   The British were eventually able to squeeze out other competition in New Canaan such as the Dutch, French, Danish and Scots (although with the Scots they formed a joint overseas sort of thing).  So by the 19th century the British dominated New Canaan even if they didn't officially control all the territory.  

3.  Interesting question.  The fundamental interactions between humans and modernus is more akin to two predators of different species meeting each other, that is to say avoidance.   After all they are two different species which can't easily communicate with each other despite being at the same intelligence level.    Violence usually occurs when they are backed into a corner with nowhere to go.
In the case of the Colorado Culture attacking British settlers that is actually the decision makers of the Colorado Culture believing themselves to be backed into a corner.  Unlike many modernus the elites of the Colorado Culture are aware of how much territory humans have and they have a rough idea of how many humans there are.  Additionally it is political advantageous for Colorado to support modernus groups who are near British settlers as it allows them to try and induct them into the Colorado Culture and fulfills the religious mandate of the elites.

What's wrong with wishing for a quiet life surrounded by your community,  your society and the familiarity that it all brings.

Politicians endlessly tell us about all the economic benefits of mass migration and multiculturalism, but who really feels that benefit? It's only the business owners, the already wealthy, the politicians and the elite that gain from such things. I'm sure it's wonderful for people with lots of disposable income to be able to have cheaper house keepers, have their car washed by near slave labour every week, to get an au pair for their children, to have an accented Barista serve them overpriced coffee, to have a poor zero-hours worker deliver their overpriced takeaway meal or to take yet another uber to the theatre, driven by someone who's knowledge of the UK road &amp; traffic laws leaves a lot to be desired.

The majority of people barely feel all these wonderful benefits and that's before you talk about all the issues with crime, jobs, downward pressure on wages, overburdened schools, a healthcare system struggling under the weight of all these people and much more.

Leaving the EU was about more than just the above, but this kind of thing is a key part of it. Most people just want a quiet life where they can live and work, raise their family and enjoy some of the luxuries we have been blessed with, to feel safe and comfortable in their communities. Most recognise that a vote to leave the EU isn't a one-size-fits-all solution that will solve all their ills, but they do see that it is probably the best step they can take to tell the powers that be that there are major issues which need resolving and they do not feel listened to.

All you have to do is drive out of Lagos or Abuja and you‚Äôll see how dirt poor and underdeveloped the country is. Being swarmed by 20 street children asking for ‚Äúchop‚Äù (food) in Kaduna was an eye opening experience.

    Author: obtrae Body: Ey, let's all agree that there are a few nice looking places in Africa, but there's still a shit ton of work that still needs to be done. As a South African, I can confirm that there's a lot of messed up places.

To view it in military terms, in terms of its effects upon the stability of the Middle East, its effects upon the people of Iraq, or in terms of domestic British politics, is a profound mistake. By all all of those metrics, it was a disaster, and I am sure that Tony Blair had a pretty good idea that this would be the case in advance. 

However, given that the UK sits on the edge of Europe (evidenced during the Blair years by reluctance to join the Euro), it remained and remains vital for us to maintain a child seat at the Americans' table as an insurance policy. Indeed, Brexit demonstrates the wisdom of such a policy (I have not attempted to calculate the cost of our American wars, but it is probably not smaller than the nett cost of EU membership). 

Unfortunately, the political direction of the USA is not really compatible with that of the UK. The Americans are currently in the process of re-evaluating their national interest, and although a hypothetical Prime Minister Boris ""Fuck Business"" Johnson would perhaps get on reasonably well with Donald Trump, we are less able than the Americans to afford the cost of protectionist policies inimical to trade, especially given that we desire to maintain public spending to fund such institutions as the NHS.

Ultimately, I think that we need to stay with the EU because American interests are most likely to favour breaking up the NHS, removing workers' rights, and deregulating our industries to the disbenefit of us all.

&gt; Additionally, the economic impact is lower using an ETS. This is because emissions abatement does not cost the same across each sector. Just have a look at marginal abatement cost curves. Since the cost is different across sectors, the sectors where it is cheaper can abate by more and sell the credits to another sector. Therefore, the economic impact is lower under an ETS.

A Pigouvian carbon tax allows for different MAC curves across sectors, emitters. Like in an ETS where emitters with low MAC will sell their permits up until it is no longer profitable, a firm under a carbon tax will abate up until the point where abatement would cost the same as paying the tax. The static outcome looks the same for an ETS and a tax, where MAC is equalized among all emitters at the level of the tax. Moreover, both provide the same incentives to innovate in a dynamic context. I'm not sure if you want a source for this, but you could find more in just about every environmental economics textbook. 

&gt; To hit a specific target using a tax, the elasticities need to be known. Under an ETS there is no need to know them

There is very much a need to know them as the regulator must set a socially optimal quantity of emissions permits to be traded. This relies on knowing the very same information as we would need to know under a Pigouvian tax. Moreover, there are ways to roughly approximate elasticities, the real problem is knowing firms abatement costs which is of course only known to the firm. However Weitzman (1974) showed that if we know the relative steepness of the marginal costs and marginal benefits we can generally employ a rule of thumb to decide between the two. Specifically, if the marginal cost curves are steeper than marginal benefits, then price control (carbon tax) will generally result in less of a DWL when uncertainty exists regarding abatement costs. Important to note that here the policy is not the case of the DWL per se, information asymmetries are causing the market failure. 

Weitzman: https://scholar.harvard.edu/weitzman/files/prices_vs_quantities.pdf

The reasons why economists tend to prefer price over quantity control isn't about one being more efficient than the other in a stripped down, simplified model. Theoretically both should have the same result. However we know have several decades of experience with ETS to draw from, particularly the EU ETS. There are many variables that can influence whether a carbon market will function properly, including volume of trades, forward markets, number of participants, etc. This implies there are a lot of ways a carbon market can perform poorly. Newell et al (2013) gives a good review of some of these problems.

Newell: https://www.jstor.org/stable/41825465?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents

Also, linking carbon markets can be quite complex. When the overall objective is to create a harmonized global carbon price, a tax is an administratively easier route.

Together with your later point about pride coming before a fall, I guess you're trying to understand Leavers through the lens of some old-fashioned thing like honour codes or some equivalent delusion of grandeur.

I think that's the wrong way to go about it. There *is* a sense in which the old post-war social compact has eroded since Thatcher, and the social standing of regular voters has been diminished. But people are not reacting against that trend for prideful reasons, rather for practical ones - the promises of a better life for our children have been switched out for zero-hours, generation rent, nil pension ... by Labour and Lib Dems as much as by Tories. Once the working class was defeated as a political force, the spoils of profitable growth immediately switched from being distributed by an active State to being shovelled offshore for the benefit of our new plutocrats and those few lucky enough to find a gig helping them pump out the value. 

If you want to understand Leavers it's necessary to stop acting as if George Osborne was telling the truth when he said ""We're all in it together"". That's the giant lie at the heart of the Remain dream.

&gt; I genuinely don't get how you see this playing out without us ending up being supremely humiliated on the world stage by a number of powers 

So we're, what, the fifth (or sixth?) largest national economy in the world, with a unique diplomatic footprint. What Blair dismisses as a medium-sized country in his ""power is power"" argument, putting our clout behind higher population places like Indonesia and India. 

Well, OK, but how do other non-aligned nations manage, even much smaller ones? As it turns out, pretty damn well, if they play their cards right and recognise that the big beasts are in *competition* for access and cooperation. We have a market, still, and skills, to which others want access. There's no need for bullies to have their way.

&gt;WTO rules form the weakest negotiating position we can start from. Once we put ourselves in that position we need to *start negotiating*.

Yes, and it's frustrating that Westminster has allowed the EU to back us into this corner, however the only way out short of abject surrender is to kick a hole in the wall. Once we've done that the dynamic with the EU shifts. It loses its claim on providing the responsible approach due to the damage to member state economies caused by its gamesmanship. New potentials will rapidly emerge.

&gt;**The US:** This is the worst time in recent history to try and get a good deal with the US

Canada has been inside *NAFTA* for years and has a deal with the EU. This stuff is overly catastrophised for the sake of making independence sound impossible. It's far from impossible.

&gt;**The EU**: If you perceive the EU as bullies now, 

They're just technocrats attempting to resist the centrifugal forces in all of their member nations. If and when the UK slips the leash, they will be in quite a different world. 

&gt;On top of this they'll not accept food exports from us 

See above.

&gt;**China**: Not much to say here other than we all expect them to be totally ruthless in negotiations based on experience. 

I don't see a categorical difference between China and the eschaton the EU is attempting to immanentize in Europe. Europe still distinguishes itself from China in terms of the democratic rights we enjoy here, underpinned by a strong demos in most of our nation states, but the EU system and its ardent defenders seem to be increasingly unenthusiastic about those. 

&gt;**Zero-tarrifs:** The idea that we can trade on zero-tariffs 

Yeah, I don't get that, myself.

A Tissue Solutions, com sede em Glasgow, na Esc√≥cia, se define como um ""banco biol√≥gico"".

Ela organiza amostras de tecido humano a serem coletadas e entregues em todo o mundo.

""Cientistas e laborat√≥rios precisam de tecido humano para desenvolver e testar novos medicamentos"", diz o fundador e CEO da empresa, Dr. Morag McFarlane.

Ela disse √† revista The Nine, da BBC escocesa: ""Eles precisam recorrer a algu√©m que possa coletar esse material eticamente e gerenciar todo o processo para eles"".

     Image caption  A Dr Morag McFarlane diz que laborat√≥rios precisam de tecidos humanos para desenvolver novas drogas   Para ser um sucesso de exporta√ß√£o, uma empresa precisa de c√©rebros. A Tissue Solutions os possui, ou pelo menos peda√ßos de c√©rebros.

Eles tamb√©m podem fornecer sangue, saliva e muito mais.

""At√© cabelo"", diz Morag.

""E coisas bizarras, como l√≠ngua, dedos, dedos, coc√¥.""

Ah sim - amostras de mat√©ria fecal.

     Image caption  Mat√©ria fecal foi coletada para desenvolver um kit para testar em casa se a pessoa tem c√¢ncer no intestino   Essa linha de produtos espec√≠fica come√ßou quando outra empresa de Glasgow estava desenvolvendo um kit de teste caseiro para c√¢ncer de intestino.

Eles estavam indo bem simulando o material misturando √°gua com uma certa marca de cereal matinal √† base de farelo de trigo.

Mas √† medida que a pesquisa avan√ßava, a empresa precisava do material real. Ent√£o eles ligaram para a Tissue Solutions.

""N√≥s contratamos um grupo, e eles recrutaram doadores, coletaram as amostras, processaram-nas e depois a empresa obteve os dados"", diz McFarlane.

     Image caption  Amostras de f√≠gado tamb√©m podem ser solicitadas por pesquisadores   Existem outras formas de adquirir as amostras, todas elas certificadas como √©ticas.

No caso de tumores, pacientes de hospitais na Esc√≥cia automaticamente consentem em ter amostras usadas para prop√≥sitos de pesquisa.

Grupos de volunt√°rios ajudam com outras mercadorias.

Alguns concordam que um buraco de 5mm seja feito em sua pele.

Pessoas com psor√≠ase (uma doen√ßa de pele) costumam ser doadoras de pele com boa vontade, j√° que suas amostras podem levar a novos tratamentos.

     Image caption  Pessoas com psor√≠ase (uma doen√ßa de pele) costumam ser doadoras de pele com boa vontade, j√° que suas amostras podem levar a novos tratamentos.   Os tecidos e res√≠duos podem ser armazenados em qualquer lugar e entregues em qualquer lugar, desde que o fornecimento seja √©tico.

Isso significa que pouco do material realmente passa pela sede da Tissue Solutions, no Parque Cient√≠fico do Oeste da Esc√≥cia.

Entregas fresquinhas
--------------------

Organizar entregas √© o trabalho da gerente de log√≠stica e transporte Laura White.

""Eu tenho muitos envios acontecendo hoje, principalmente sangue"", diz ela.

""Eu tenho amostras de urina que v√™m da Bulg√°ria e da Rom√™nia, e ambas est√£o chegando a um cliente no Reino Unido.""

""Ent√£o, logisticamente, o neg√≥cio √© manter o controle disso todos os dias, ver o que est√° sendo enviado, se foi entregue, levar o produto para o cliente.""

     Image caption  Organizar entregas √© o trabalho da gerente de log√≠stica e transporte Laura White   Esses clientes n√£o est√£o procurando por qualquer sangue, cuspe ou xixi.

Frequentemente, eles querem testar a efic√°cia dos medicamentos em amostras de pessoas com a doen√ßa que est√£o tentando combater.

As amostras podem ser enviadas em temperatura ambiente, como √© o caso de tecidos preservados em blocos de cera de parafina.

Elas tamb√©m podem ser congeladas e mantidas em gelo seco a -80 graus Celsius.

     Image caption  Muitos produtos t√™m que ser mantidos congelados   Uma utilidade de amostras de tumores rec√©m-retirados √© para pesquisas que tentam transformar o sistema imunol√≥gico do paciente contra o c√¢ncer.

""As pessoas querem tumores novos"", diz o Dr. McFarlane, ""para que possam avaliar, no tumor real, qual o efeito da droga no sistema imunol√≥gico, se pode realmente estimular o sistema imunol√≥gico a atacar o tumor e come√ßar a mat√°-lo"".

O mercado de tecidos humanos e biomateriais est√° crescendo. Um fator √© a campanha contra os testes em animais.

Outro √© que a biologia animal n√£o √© biologia humana. Um tratamento que funcionou bem no laborat√≥rio pode falhar quando administrado a seres humanos.

Os neg√≥cios internacionais da Tissue Solutions v√™m crescendo desde a sua funda√ß√£o h√° 12 anos. Agora empregam 25 pessoas.

Sucesso de exporta√ß√£o
---------------------

O Departamento de Com√©rcio Internacional do Reino Unido aponta para o setor como um exemplo. No ano passado exportou quase ¬£ 25 bilh√µes (aproximadamente R$ 125 bi) somente em produtos medicinais e farmac√™uticos.

Mas √© s√≥ mencionar a incerteza em torno de Brexit e Dr McFarlane geme.

A empresa ganhou duas vezes o Pr√™mio de Empreendimento da Rainha pelo sucesso de suas exporta√ß√µes. Suas vendas no exterior cresceram mais de 200% em tr√™s anos.

Est√£o determinados a evitar que o Brexit n√£o interrompa isso.

""Criamos duas novas empresas, uma em Dublin, na Irlanda, e outra em Lyon, ent√£o, se precisarmos, podemos a trabalhar com essas empresas para facilitar as coisas"", diz McFarlane.

A taxa de retorno de clientes da empresa est√° em 80%, uma indica√ß√£o de alta satisfa√ß√£o.

Mas n√£o √© poss√≠vel agradar a todos.

Eles receberam um pedido de um material espec√≠fico. Desculpe, mas estamos falando de coc√¥ de novo.

As amostras foram congeladas, seladas, embaladas e enviadas.

Mas o cliente reclamou. O coc√¥ era ""muito fedorento"".

A Dr. McFarlane ri: ""N√£o tivemos resposta para eles"".

""N√≥s n√£o poder√≠amos dizer 'o que voc√™ esperava?' Mas foi o que todos pensamos.""

As part of the largest political union, the UK has unprecedented access to a large market and the ability to influence not only the EU but the rest of the world through power projection. By leaving the EU the UK loses this and those people are acting all inpatient about it are going to be very disappointed. 

That seems to be the argument that the UK has rejected, and arguably rejected for quite a long time. The UK would rather be a partner to the EU than part of it. Something that has costs and benefits.

&gt;As their world view is built on the lie that the grass is greener when it is clearly not and if they keep on believing that, I am going to think that they are delusional.

It's a nice narriative, it has kept the remain side hoping that they can shift things, but it's broadly false don't you think? The issue with the UK and the EU isn't that people have been sold the notion of a better UK outside of the EU (That was mostly an artifact of the referendum campaign), the issue with the UK and the EU is that there is so little support for the actual EU as a project. It's why remain haven't framed the EU as a broad positive, but rather something that has to be accepted, and should be reformed.

The problem is that people in the UK aren't on board with the project, they just about like what they perceive as the economic benefits, but beyond that? Not really.

&gt;Most people in other EU countries have accepted this, for example 87% of Spaniards and 90% of Irish people don‚Äôt think leaving the EU is a good idea but a decent chunk of the British population refuse to accept that.

It's subjective, if you object to the notion of pooling sovereignty with a slew of other countries, or don't like the direction the EU is heading then you aren't ever going to see EU membership as a good idea, and indeed in that context it isn't. It's not a 'refusal to accept' it's a difference in view.

&gt;I am not saying that Brexit in itself is a fantasy either but they way that it was marketed is. Both before the referendum and more recently, especially with the push for no deal by a lot of Brexit supporters who at the time claimed that it would be a pice of cake to get a trade deal. It is also not an insignificant minority of people pushing for this and many have quite a decent amount of influence over British politics.

The problem with that is that the peak of UK support for the EU was in about 1975, it dipped massively thereafter (for obvious reasons) recovered a bit in the late 90's, was ignored by everyone again as much as possible, then rose again in 2015, and arguably over the referendum too.  The message on the EU over that period hasn't exactly been consistent, it has been attacked by the left and right (not unreasonably usually) and frankly, people didn't buy into it.

In that context, what do you expect?

After birth abortion bills are bullshit by the religious extremists to get people to give up their souls and be willing to move toward theocracy.  I have never once seen a serious bill or group who thinks killing a 2-hour old born baby is acceptable.  Even late-term abortion is highly controversial, and only allowed by pro-choice people because doctors don't flipping *do* those unless they're medically necessary and laws preventing them only serve to cause mother-child death scenarios.

&gt; I do not believe we should expect the religious to take no action in the face of what they consider to be immense immorality

Cmon.  The religious right have been fighting Roe v Wade ever since a conservative SCOTUS decided the constitution didn't allow for it.  This isn't about saving lives (which an abortion ban wouldn't do) but about making sure the government punishes people along with their own morality.  It is what is really evil.

The issue has become that we in the Western world has forgotten what it's like to have religious tyranny at home.  We've forgotten how quickly ""execute the other guy for his blasphemy"" historically turns around and burns us as well.

&gt; Tell me, if you stand at the edge of a cliff is forward progress a good thing?

I can imagine the priests in the South said the same thing about progressives as they quote the Old Testament about the evils or banning slavery.  But we're not even talking about taking a step forward because this isn't conservativism.  We're talking about taking steps **backward** into a realm we already know the outcomes to.  And the outcomes are terrible, but ""more moral"" to the zealots.

I'm highly religious, but not Abrahamic.  I have a generally very positive opinion of Abrahamic religions, and am generally a pacifist.  But when we cross the line of religious tyrrany, *that* is being ruled by evil.

I'm not an anti-theist, but if your statement, that zealots should destroy governments that follow contradictory morals... if it really is the nature of things, then maybe the antitheists are right... because statements like the one you just made terrify.  The certainty of genuine moral superiority led to the Catholics executing Protestants throughout Europe, then led to Protestants executing Catholics throughout England, then led to Hitler executing Jews throughout Europe.  ALL of them talked like you are talking now.  And in truth, there have already been talks of charging everyone involved with any abortion with murder, so a mass of doctor-and-woman executions could be exactly what kicks off this next phase.

&gt;If someone chooses to leave an ‚Äúambiguously worded‚Äù rule like that up while posting pictures that *easily* denote racist undertones, how stupid does someone have to be to say that it‚Äôs not racist at all? Answer: your level of stupid.

More like answer: I can't prove that the rule means no non-white people allowed to post not just no pictures of non-whites allowed so I shall just assume it does. (Hint: It's a sub dedicated to white beauty so rub those two brain cells of yours together and you might just figure it out) But I doubt you can since you've already decided that a sub explicitly appreciating white people = racism.

&gt;Did I say it had a screening process? Can you prove it doesn‚Äôt?

What the fuck is the point of a rule like that then. Go post on the sub saying that you're non-white and see if you get banned. You prove it.

&gt;That wasn‚Äôt even my point.

What even is your point?

&gt;Making comments on reddit posts = OMG HAHA YOU HAVE SUCH A SAD LIFE SINCE YOU FOUND A POST FUNNY OR INTERESTING AND COMMENTED ON IT!!1!

No I said policing digital spaces for the slightest tint of racism is fucking pathetic. Can you read?

&gt;I‚Äôd say being a pathetic white genocide believer is sad, so let‚Äôs agree to disagree.

I said whites are becoming a minority I didn't say they are being persecuted or killed where did you even get genocide from? Keep grasping at straws kid.

&gt;If a white person and a black person have a kid, is the kid devoid of all white DNA?

How fucking stupid are you? Of course not. What I'm saying is that miscegenation erodes identity and ethnic diversity, even more abstract expressions of race such as culture, that is what you people want right? Instead of incentivizing young people to build families and to strengthen ethnically bonded communities, we should abandon all concepts of national identity and turn ourselves into a mulatto consumerist slave class, devoid of personal identity and heritage, owing loyalty to only global conglomerates. Truly the dream of every neoliberal capitalist.

&gt;You just consider skin whiteness to be the same thing as European descent

Again just more empty handed stramanning. I hope nobody would think that because that's pretty dumb.

&gt;falling for this fearmongering

What part of ""white people compromise a small percentage of the world population and are steadily decreasing"" is fear mongering? That is a legitimate fact. You've taken what I've said and exaggerated it to become some genocidal Alex Jones conspiracy theory, kind of similar to how you exaggerate the intentions of the white beauty sub, lol.

&gt;What part of celebrating heritage involves disparaging nonwhites?

I'm not sure, you tell me since you're the one soiling his nappy over a sub dedicated to what is the product of thousands of years of European evolution.

&gt;Want to blame nonwhites for ‚Äúbreeding‚Äù you into extinction? Not cool.

I think there's a strong case to be made for people in white countries being bombarded with foreigners, but by no accounts is anyone being ""bred"" into extinction. People are free to procreate with who they love, and rates of interracial mixing aren't even that high.

&gt;That‚Äôs *far* from what you implied earlier. Funny.

Yeah, well, it's not worth digging into the hundreds of subs for people like you who have a hate boner for whites. You're honestly not worth it. I'm slowly getting down syndrome from having looked at this sub alone. Black supremacy subreddits are totally allowed by the way, just gotta put it under the guise of being a 'fetish' as well as any other sub for black beauty, but r/whitebeauty is quarantined.

[],ApprehensiveBag8,,,,[],,,,text,t2_3ix6lw0v,False,"The examples you listed were either already defunct before Trent, or aren't actually a Rite. The Western Rites were actually much more diverse than the Eastern Rites, to a dangerous and unaccountable degree. If the Roman Rite had not been enforced, we would probably have seen the Church splinter into a bunch of micro-Churches and single-diocese Churches, on an even smaller scale than the Orthodox national churches.

Imagine those little local rites like the Ambrosian or Mozarabic Rite, except they're actually schismatic dioceses dotted across Europe, enforcing local folk traditions that the Church has condemned. That is the situation we would have probably faced, if the Church had not brought everybody up to speed on how to practise the faith.

I get that you want to demonise the Old Mass to get the last laugh at the trads, but you actually can't argue that this was a bad thing without making up history.

To address what you mentioned:

The African Rite was around during St Augustine's time, and was already defunct long before Trent. It was the first liturgy to be in Latin though.

The Gallican Rites were not an organised set of books, but a very disorganised hodgepodge of local customs of the Latin Rite across a large region. There was no singular rite to actually suppress or preserve, it was more a matter of organising them into something cohesive and accountable, and the Roman Rite was similar to what they were already doing. The Dominican Rite still exists and is sometimes considered to be a living example of a 'Gallican Rite', because they actually sat down and organised it properly in the 1200s.

Celtic Christianity was very disunited and anarchical. In different times and places across the isles, things like the date of Easter, clerical celibacy, and even the laity regularly attending Mass fell out of practice. There are accounts of people within towns observing different dates for Easter, and therefore some people would be feasting while others would still be in Lent.

But you are mistaken in thinking that Pius V is to blame for the loss of those rites. In fact, it was at the time of the Norman Conquest that those traditions were replaced. The Normans were more in the loop with what the Church was doing on the continent, and enforced that on the Insular Church.

When all is said and done, nobody defends bad and messy traditions to justify the suppression of a good, refined tradition, unless they are making post-hoc historical arguments for some agenda they already arrived at.

[],Yes-i-had-to-say-it,,,,[],,,,text,t2_3ullqiho,False,"Oh boy i was waiting for you to throw out your 'experience'. You lived there for 4 months oh jolly now youre well versed. Not to mention you visited one tiny area in an entire continent and youre confident youve seen it all. It's like an asian or an african visiting Sigulda in latvia for four months and think they now know all that pertains to Europe.

Concerning your first and second points

You dont stop being a dumb cunt because you're from a bigger city. Problem with tourists is that they land in an area and think they've seen it all. Also you're confusing western education with african education and think that means that guy is exposed because he ""was from a bigger city and had higher education"". Maybe i should elaborate tanzanians, perhaps i should say most africans in general grow up watching american films american news american gossip american this american that you get the point. And it is highly glamorized and i mean a lot. the blacks that they get to see on tv are usually either gangsta's with money or celebrities with money. So a lot of them end up wanting that lifestyle because they think everyone there is balling. Do you know what the word for whites is ""mzungu"" which is associated with status and wealth. There is a lot of western imitation there due to the media. A lot of them also treat whites as royalty especially the more they lack exposure. There is a lot of slave mentality still going on there which is why you find a lot of idiots like that guy who genuinely believe that they can make it outside even if they have to be shackled. Not to mention the corrupt government that usually makes it that much harder and of course the various friends who come back with loads of money. They dont know the friends have been working as janitors or waiters at mcdonalds they only see the green.  

Concerning your third point

Its right there in the title so yeah you said it. Also No you really dont know whats its like mate. Staying there for 4 months and expecting you're now well versed in african issues is extremely naive not to mention youre white so a lot gets hidden from you. And i dont mean the broken down villages and what not i mean real social issues.

Concerning your fourth point

I never stated it isnt riddled with inequalities the entire continent is full of inequalities. Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in africa there might be domestic stability but economy wise there's not much going on. But that doesnt mean that there arent lots of places with better and healthier lifestyles than some places in the west. In fact a major problem with african countries is the fact that you can find the most beautiful town/city/neighbourhood which is immediately followed by some really nasty shit areas. So you always have a lot of individuals living nicely and a lot also living deplorably. But here's the thing ive seen the very same issues in western nations only on a scaled down version

Concerning your last point

This game is an exception because it's on going post 2014/Disney Era and even tho it is not official a part of canon, it must obey canon/lore as per the Lucasfilm Story Group provisions. [you can read more about that here - https://r2d2arm.wordpress.com/tag/story-group/]

That said, I would agree with you regarding Juggs being the more stereotypical 'Sith' because they only use one Lightsaber.

I wouldn't put much worth to Kreia's comments. She was lying the entire time and she was trying to have the player help her to destroy the force, that's why she was trying to make you into something that doesn't fit in well with the true nature of the force [duality].

There's no 'Grey' in canon or in this game.

&gt;my understanding of how empires have historically fallen 

care to elobarate?

The ancient empires, like rome, byzantium, persia, etc. can hardly be compared to the united states, due to an extreme difference in technology.

And it took two devastating world wars to kill the british empire, a giant revolution and literal anarchy for the french empire, a madman with the strongest military in the world running wild in europe for Spain, a war agianst basically everyone for the Germany Empire and extreme ethinc tensions due to 50,000 nationalist minorities, and an unqeual and incompetent monarchy for Austria-Hungary to fall.

I don't really see many parallels other than classic european monarchy and war between ""equal"" superpowers, which don't work for the us.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; the economic rise of China that threatens the status of the dollar  

The trade war not help usa or china, however it will damage china more than the usa, as china depends more on the us, than the us depends on china, so usa would be the ""winner"" of that war.

4. What quarter/year do you expect US roll out to be? 
5. How are MTL progressing, how many states do you currently have an MTL in?
6. Others have mentioned and it has come up a lot on telegram and reddit, insurance for the tokens and security on the app. Could you comment on how finding an insurance partner is coming?
7.  Are you planning on having 2FA or being able to have user controlled suspend withdrawals within the app to improve security?

As a European, who has lived in the US (3 years), Canada (5 years), as well as the UK, Netherlands, France, and Spain, I‚Äôd like to chime in on your comment to clear up a few misconceptions you might have, since it sounds like you never left the US:

- healthcare in most European countries beats the snot out of the US. In the Netherlands, wait times rarely exceed a week to two weeks for minor &amp; major procedures. Prescriptions are free, and the country heavily emphasizes preventative medicine, resulting in an overall better quality of life. Cost: ‚Ç¨125 per month (as a self employed individual, if you‚Äôre employed, you pay very little to nothing). 

- the same goes for France. 

While the UK is far from perfect, I do agree that they have a problem with radicalization; however, looking at recent events in the US, foreign &amp; domestic acts of terror still far outweigh the amount of events in Europe. 

Regarding your disdain of socialism: if you get your news primarily from Fox, I can see why you‚Äôd think that socialism is ‚Äúvery bad‚Äù (to quote your president).
However, paying around 35-40% in taxes ensures a proper pension, mostly free post-secondary education, proper healthcare, actual in-depth training of our police forces (which result in little to no police violence; something that the US wouldn‚Äôt know a thing about), etc. 

Again, this is coming from the position of someone who has lived &amp; worked in the countries you mentioned. The fact is that most US households are ‚Äúhouse poor‚Äù, deep in debt (looking at consumer financing, the rate Americans tend to re-mortgage their properties at, payday loans, student loan debts, rise of outsourcing middle class jobs, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

I rise to my feet as I look around the house, seeing many members squirming on the benches, much as changed in the past few days after the man claiming to be King Arthur circulated a video of the Lady of the Lake presenting him with Excalabur.

&amp;#x200B;

""I know all of you have seen the video of which I speak, but I must say with all seriousness, we are no longer that country. We shed the yoke of the monarchy more than 100 years ago when we revolted against the tyrannical rule of Charles III,"" I said to the house as members began barracking. ""We have grown as a nation from the back water we were before, we now rule Europe, North America is in shambles, and people are looking to us to lead. Do we want to go back to the days where an unelected man ruled over us just because he happened to be born from the right mother.""

&amp;#x200B;

Jeers came from all corners of the house. There is still a significant contingent that would love to see the monarchy restored, and at the same time republicans were jeering back.

&amp;#x200B;

""We are now a true democracy, no longer can any so called king just dissolve this house if he doesn't like our decisions, no longer can anyone tell us what we are and are not allowed to do in this place. We represent the people, and it is our job to protect the people from any tyranny that presents on our shores."" I continued. ""We are now at a crossroads, yes we have authenticated that the sword is legitimate, yes we are aware that the claim is technically valid, but we not have the power to say no, we have the say on who our leaders are, and we have the power to tell this so called Arthur King no.""

&amp;#x200B;

As you return to your seat the house erupts in screaming as members scream at each other.

&amp;#x200B;

""Sir Walter Wilanby,"" screams the speaker, trying to be heard over the noise.

&amp;#x200B;

""May I ask the Prime Minister, if this house were to vote in favor of the resolution offered by my honorable friend from Thornberry South, what would be the ramifications for this house?""

&amp;#x200B;

""That is unknown, Arthur refuses to state how he would handle his role, by ancient law, lost to anyone until Arthur made himself known, any person who holds the title King would have the power to rule on their own. War would be declared in the name of, and by the King. The only power this house would retain without the permission of this King would be to levy taxes.""

&amp;#x200B;

A murmer flowed over the house as members looked at each other. BANG, something hits the door to the house. BANG, again this time some splinters fly. BANG, the door flies open and there standing in it is a man in a traditional military uniform from 2034. Several members of the house fall to their knees, others turn their backs in disgust as Arthur enters the chamber.

&amp;#x200B;

""I as Arthur King of the Brittons do declare that the House of Commons of the Kingdom of Europe is now dissolved,"" shouted Arthur over the yelling and screaming of all MP's.

&amp;#x200B;

""Lest I remind you that you are not allowed in this chamber,"" shouted the Speaker. ""We have yet to vote on your claim.""

&amp;#x200B;

""There is nothing to vote on here, I am your king and I am ordering that this house is dissolved,"" yelled Arthur getting more and more angry.

&amp;#x200B;

I rise to my feet and turn to the speaker. The speaker nods to me,

&amp;#x200B;

""This house has stood for 100 years without a king, and now we are to fall in line because this man was presented a sword. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!""

&amp;#x200B;

The members calmed down, no one had put it so bluntly to the public. No one had clearly shown the absurdity of the claim being made. Most members were clearly now in agreement. 

&amp;#x200B;

""Prime Minister Dennis, I believe I have heard enough,"" said the Leader of the Opposition. ""I think it is time we vote.""

&amp;#x200B;

The vote was not even close 516 against Arthurs claim only 77 voted for it.

Okay, here's what's racist:

Baku has all the infrastructure to host an EL final. In fact, Baku and Azerbeijan are famous for hosting lots of international sports events. For example, a Formula 1 Grand Prix every year. Just next month: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_European_Youth_Summer_Olympic_Festival

And Baku will be one of the host cities for the Euro 2020. Baku has even been a candidate to host the Olympic games. 

The idea that Baku ""lacks infrastructure"" is a completely insane racist nonsense because it has no basis in reality. If anything, Baku has too much infrastructure - on a per capita basis, I bet it has more than any western European city.

&gt;Since 2002, Baku has hosted 36 major sporting events and selected to host the 2015 European Games.[97] Baku is also to host the fourth edition of the Islamic Solidarity Games in 2017.

&gt;Baku is also one of world's leading chess centres, having produced famous grandmasters like Teimour Radjabov, Vugar Gashimov, Garry Kasparov, Shahriyar Mammadyarov and Rauf Mammadov, as well as the arbiter Faik Hasanov. The city also annually hosts the international tournaments such as Baku Chess Grand Prix, President's Cup, Baku Open and currently bidding to host 42nd Chess Olympiad in 2014.[98][99]

&gt;First class sporting facilities were built for the indoor games, including the Palace of Hand Games and Heydar Aliyev Sports and Exhibition Complex. It hosted many sporting events, including FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, Rhythmic Gymnastics European Championships in 2007 and 2009, 2005 World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships, 2007 FILA Wrestling World Championships and 2010 European Wrestling Championships, 2011 World Amateur Boxing Championships, 2009 Women's Challenge Cup and European Taekwondo Championships in 2007.[100][101] Since 2011 the city annually hosts WTA tennis event called Baku Cup.[102]

&gt;The Synergy Baku Cycling Project participates in the Tour d'Azerba√Ødjan a 2.2 multi-stage bicycle race on the UCI Europe Tour.

Second, there is no war in Baku whatsoever. There is no war in actual Azerbaijan controlled territory. There is a dispute over a territory where on occasion there are scuffles. To equate this to ""being embroiled in war"" is completely unhinged. Baku is one of the safest, less violent, cities in the world. 

In fact, Azerbaijan is a much, much safer country than the UK:

https://www.numbeo.com/crime/compare_countries_result.jsp?country1=Azerbaijan&amp;country2=United+Kingdom

The only type of crime the UK rates higher is corruption. Everything else, from car robberies to hate crimes, from murder to battery, from insults to vandalism, the UK isn't even close to Azerbaijan. 

So only a racist would make a bizarre claim that "" are embroiled in war"" or ""lack the resources"".

I am excited beyond words to announce that Siralim 3 will be available for Nintendo Switch on July 5 of this year!As most of you know, the Siralim series is heavily inspired by an old Gameboy game called Dragon Warrior Monsters. There was always something cool about being able to carry a game as massive as DWM around with you in your pocket, and finally, you‚Äôll be able to do the same with Siralim. I‚Äôve been play-testing Siralim 3 on my Switch for the last several weeks and I am so, so happy with how the port turned out. Siralim truly feels at home on a Nintendo system, and I can‚Äôt wait to share it with you.If you‚Äôre as excited about this launch as I am, feel free to head over to the store page on Nintendo‚Äôs website and check it out now: https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/siralim-3-switch/I know that many of you have a lot of questions about the Switch launch, so I‚Äôve prepared a list of FAQTNAAY (frequently asked questions that nobody actually asked yet): Q. In what regions will the Switch version of Siralim 3 be available?A. It will be available in the North American, European, and Australian regions. The launch date is the same for all regions. Q. How much will it cost?A. $14.99 USD in the North American region, and 14.99 euros in the European region. If you are from a country that uses a different currency, Nintendo will convert these prices to your local currency automatically. Q. Are there any features missing from the Switch version that are included in the Steam/mobile versions of the game?A. The only feature that is missing is cross-platform cloud saving. Everything else is exactly the same as in the Steam/mobile versions of the game. Q. Even holiday events, Tavern Brawls, and other online content?A. Yes. It‚Äôs all included in the Switch version, just as it is with other consoles. Q. Will you ever release physical copies of Siralim 3 for Switch?A. I really doubt it. Anything is possible, but unless the digital sales are really good and a publisher decides to help us out, it‚Äôs probably not a feasible option. Q. Will you release Siralim and Siralim 2 on Switch?A. No, those games were created with a different engine, so I‚Äôd need to port them to Siralim 3‚Äôs engine first‚Ä¶ and for as long as that would take me to do, I could create a whole new game during that time.

Furthermore, there is now an absolutely overwhelming amount of evidence showing that they interbred themselves out of existence, which data shows was MUCH more impactful on their population than the Europeans at war with them.

* There's no link to the poll in the Guardian article so how am I meant to take these figures seriously? What was the question? Did they compare Remain to May's Deal? Remain to No Deal? Remain to a Left Deal? Impossible to draw conclusion.

* Labour Members are not the same as Labour Voters. They are more likely to be young, white, middle class, and well educated. These are all demographics more likely to vote Remain, and thus skew the result of such polls towards supporting Remain. Labour has many members - 500,000 as of this article being written, but it received nearly 13 million votes last election. There's a big discrepency between the opinions of people that vote Labour and people in the party. And I say this as a Remain voting, young, white, ""middle class"" Labour member.

I chose those players because they started for the first team at a very young age, showing they were hyped up. I'm not saying he's not a very good youth player, he clearly is. **But he's only 15**. He has a long way to go before you can start talking about him with any certainty. 


&gt; Martial wasn't nearly as good or talented, still managed to fuck off in England and immediatly be United's best attacker in his debut season.

Did you completely miss my point about Martial not improving since being a teenager? In fact he's the perfect example of a kid who gets hyped up then doesn't improve. Martial had his best seasons as a teenager then didn't improve further. His highest scoring season for United is his first one for example


&gt;The two others weren't even as promising as Martial, neither Bahlouli nor Benzia were playing far above their age group like Cherki does,

They literally made their *professional* debuts (you know, not a youth match) at age 16 or 17. That's a much bigger deal than playing with older youth players. Don't deny they were hyped or why did they make their debut so early?



&gt;neither of them were ever put on a pedestal by Aulas, our coaches and scouts all at once.

And yet they made their professional debuts when they were 16 or 17. Hmm

&gt;Aouar,Fekir,Tolisso,Benzema,Umtiti,Lacazette,Martial,Lopes 

Aouar was nearly 19 when he made his debut, Fekir was 20 (and actually made his debut coming on for a much younger Benzia), Tolisso was almost 19 (and didn't touch the ball for Lyon until he was 19), Benzema and Umtiti I've mentioned, Lacazette was 19, Martial I've mentioned, Lopes was 22. Hyping up 19 year olds is fine, you've got a good idea of how they'll do. 15, year olds you don't. It's very simple


&gt;these are the hyped players, we have a far better track record at producing players than anyone else in France, It's not even close, you're nitpicking case of ""failure"" and ignoring succesful ones lmao

I'm not denying your record, nor am I nitpicking, I'm pointing out the ones who get hyped up at a very young age tend to not do so well. A point you've actually proved for me with your examples



&gt;Wrong. This is literally what Aulas our PRESIDENT did https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgh3VXNj8gw&amp;t
&gt;
&gt;He never did that for any other player in our club's history, but this 15 year old though is already a ""enormous talent, future 1st team player who will be tied with a big big contract""

Can't watch the video in this country so can't comment. If your quote is correct then he's overhyping him too. 



&gt;Meanwhile he didn't give a fuck about selling Martial for peanuts to Monaco.

So he's a terrible decision maker since Monaco sold him for ‚Ç¨50 million or whatever it was?


&gt;We know what a special talent is when we see one.

You guys thought Bahlouli and Benzia and the rest were special talents, that's why you gave them professional debuts at such a young age. How did that work out for you?


&gt;Rayan Cherki is a Neymar lvl talent and while idiots were arguing that Neymar was a ""youtube player who would flop in Europe"", anyone smart knew he would be an immediate success because the kid was on a different lvl from everybody since his childhood.

Neymar was 21 when he came to Europe, not 15. You can judge a player well when they're in their 20s, not when they're 15 ffs.

This is difficult because buddhism in southeast Asia is different then buddhism in China than buddhism in Korea than buddhism in Japan, Tibet, etc.  Then you look at Theravada vs Mahayana vs Vajrayana and the myriad of sects that exist, each adding or removing or interpreting things in a different way.  I'm not an expert on any of these, but have looked at the history of buddhism in Japan, especially, due to studies in Japanese and martial arts history.  I will try to answer this along those lines.  

Asoka Maurya in the 3rd century BC played a major role in the spread of buddhism throughout India.  Recall that his grandfather, Candragupta, was the founder of the Maurya Empire which saw consolidation and unification of the shattered Indian states by Alexander the Great roughly five years earlier.  His son, Bindusara, expanded the empire further, and then it was Asoka's conversion that sealed the deal.  It's said that Asoka supported tens of thousands of monks and even more stupas on top of countless monasteries.  And when the teachings were brought to Ceylon, that early buddhist canon was committed to writing in the Ceylonese Mahavamsa records, where it was written-

&gt;the most learned monks handed down the text and commentary of the Three Pitakas (Tipitaka) orally; but since they perceived that the people were falling away from the orthodox teaching, the monks convened; and so that the true doctrines might endure, they wrote them down in books

The result of this is the Pali canon.  Therein lies the base for Theravada buddhism.  Included in these doctrines are rules and guidance for daily affairs with the sangha, thoughts on how to maintain communal harmony within a large and spiritually diverse community, and more teachings on how to actualize sunyata than there are grains of sand on the beach.  And throughout it all, the goal was one of ""happiness"", for that pure, true happiness brought about by realization of sunyata awakens one into the next world (so to speak)-

&gt;One should learn virtue which is of extensive goal,
and which hat the faculty of Happiness;
and one should devote oneself to Charity,
to tranquil behavior and to thoughts of Friendship.
Having devoted himself to these three virtues,
which provide reason for happiness,
a wise man gaineth the world of happiness-
a world all free from distress.

Secularity of these teachings was crucial to the spread through India and abroad.  Asoka sent teachers of the buddhist dharma to the West: Antiochus II of Syria, Ptolemy II of Egypt, Magas of Cyrene, Antigonus Gonatas of Macedonia, and Alexander II of Epirus.  This ties in to another question I answered awhile ago on [why didn't Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, or any religion from East Asia spread to the Europe Continent or Middle East via the Silk Road or any trade routes](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/4txvom/why_didnt_hinduism_buddhism_taoism_or_any/d5lepl0/?context=3).  As J. Kennedy [wrote](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25208413) in the *Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland* in 1902, Asoka's emissaries are marked in his edicts, but there appear to be no real records on the Western side of such transmissions- or rather, those transmissions taking hold.  This has the effect of keeping details of buddhist philosophy consolidated to Asia, out of the field of awareness of Western scholars even if the Rock Edicts of Asoka were available from the Indo-Greek King Menander I.  

The first Christian notice of Buddhism that I'm aware of is with Clement of Alexandria in 212AD. In his Stromata (ie, Miscellanies), he recognizes some Indians who obey the precepts of Boutta, ""whom on the account of his extraordinary sanctity they have raised to divine honours."" Clement spoke highly of Buddhism, calling it a philosophy ""first in its ranks"" for shedding light over the nations.""  It's important to understand how buddhism didn't really flow past the Middle East in the pre-medival times.  With the Silk Road example, the Turkharistan and Sogdiana regions in the Mid East acted as major trading hubs on the Silk Road between the four directions. All cultures religions and philosophies aggregated there in the 1st century AD.  Diversity existed in part because the various city-states of the region were not part of a single polity nor did they tend to have complete control over their subjects. Thus no one single religion/philosophy/politic/etc could exert dominance.  It should also be noted that this lack of cohesion resulted in differing rituals even among practitioners of the same religion; Zoroastrians and Buddhists in Sogdian cities practiced differently than those in Iran, for example.  Locality plays a major role in evolution of religion, philosophy, and other cultural aspects after all.

Why does all this matter?  Because of your question regarding the West and the idea of religion vs philosophy.  When the West thinks of religion, they think of divinity, something greater to worship, with teachings and ritual to bring one closer to that divinity.  When Jacinto Orfanel, a Spanish Dominican, arrived in Japan in 1607 to preach Christianity, he (along with other missionaries to Japan) reported back how the Japanese were- 

&gt;much addicted to their idolatries"" and ""there are some people who worship and idol called Shaka [Sakyamuni Buddha]... other people worship an idol called Amida [Amida Buddha].

Herein lies the crux to the confusion with the Western view of buddhism as religion vs philosophy.  This ""worship"" is not really worship.  Amida is not worshipped as an external deity no more than Siddhartha or Sakyamuni.  Amida, Dainichi, Kokuzo, all the Vidyaraja, are aspects of the self, with ""worship"" actually being a turn to focus on those aspects, or manifesting as that right here and now.  This secular, philosophical nature is what allowed it to spread to Daoist China and Shinto/Onmyodo-based Japan: association of similarities and acceptance of what's already there.... with a different twist.

In the negative sense, it also inspires a ""such is life"" attotude, because for every ostensibly bad thing the CCP does, say persecution of falungong, there is a historical example of why they should do that, like the taiping rebellion. This leads some people to be especially accepting of the idea that the government has gotta do what its gotta do, because it was always like this in China and, due to pride in this long and continuous history, the longest continuous civilization in current existence, it perhaps should always remain like this.

There's only 5 consonants in a row and ""rz"" makes one single sound. 

It's a compound world that consists of two separate parts where edges of both have consonants, which is not an uncommon case in most of of indoeuropean languages. 

I'm not a Polish speaker, but most of slavic languages are very similar and given that I'm Ukrainian and have some basic exposure to Polish in addition to knowing Russian and Ukrainian, I can break that word for you. 


bezskrzyd≈Çy means wingless, where 

""bez-"" prefix means ""without"" 

and ""skrzyd≈Ço"" means ""wing"". It ends with letter ""y"" due to flexic nature of slavic languages and so words endings change depending on various cases. 

No idea why there's so many consonants though as word ""skrzyd≈Ço"" in Russian and Ukrainian looks and sounds like ""–∫—Ä—ã–ª–æ/–∫—Ä–∏–ª–æ/krylo"".

I needed to get several electives for my Japanese minor, and the program I did transferred cleanly, so it wasn't like I was wasting time or anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why I wanted to do it? Because I was curious about learning a totally different culture, and living in a totally different country. I think this is a really big part of why I went there, as I'm Ukrainian and I wanted to go somewhere different from European and American cultural norms. Make sure you want the country you're choosing to live is interesting for you. I've heard a lot of stories of people that go to Australia, Western Europe, etc, where they basically live the same as they did in the US, but spent a ton more money. Or, they go there to party, which I find a bit weird, too, like they can't party at home. I'm a bit thrifty so I found it weird. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another really big (huge, actually) thing was how cheap it was for me. Housing was literally a third of what I paid in the US, so I used the money saved for meals, transport, flight tickets etc etc etc. Food was also cheaper. And, I got a bunch of grants because nobody from my school goes to Asia. I dined like a king and traveled all over and I think I only dipped $100 into my savings account, which was really unexpected. This is a big reason of why I didn't want to go to Europe.

Association football (soccer) is set up quite differently from typical American sports. In America, there is a regular season and a team's performance in the regular season qualifies them to play in the knock-out championship trophy. There some achievements along the way, such as winning your division or conference, but there's only 1 major prize per season.

In European leagues, there are multiple trophies available per season. There is the league championship, which is given to to the team with the best regular season performance. There is a domestic knockout competition, culminating in a singular final match between 2 teams, and then there is a European knockout competition (called the Champion's League), culminating in a cup final. There is also a ""junior"" version of the European knockout competition, called the Europa League. Also a few countries like England and France have 2 domestic cups for some reason. In this case one domestic cup is regarded much higher than the 2nd.

So for this reason, it's possible for a team to win multiple trophies in a season, or for 3 or 4 different clubs to win trophies, even if they are in the same league.

The interesting part is that while American sports play the cup competition after the regular season and ultimately prize the cup competition, in Europe all the competitions are played concurrently. It's quite common to play a regular league match on Saturday, a champions league match on Wednesday, then another regular league match the next Saturday, then a domestic cup match on Tuesday.

Generally speaking, winning the Champions League is the most prestigious trophy available in a given season. The domestic league championship is a close 2nd, especially in a competitive league like the English Premier League. The domestic cup is still a major trophy but it is easily less prestigious than the other 2. If there's a 2nd domestic trophy then that one is really only a target for smaller clubs and most large clubs playing in all the other competitions will field their bench players or academy prospects to get them minutes vs. playing their strongest line up to try to win the competition.

To play in the Champions League you have to do one of two things: Finish 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th in the league \*or\* win the Europa League. To play in the Europa League you have to win one of the 2 domestic cups (The FA Cup or the League Cup) or finish 5th in the league. Since the cups are often won by one of those top 5 best teams, their Europa league spots often go to the teams that finish 6th and 7th in the league. This year we finished 5th and we did not win the Europa League, so we will play in the Europa League next season.

Cup competitions require a good amount of luck and some good tactics and preparations from the manager. Winning the league requires a great amount of skill and depth to perform consistently throughout the entire season, which lasts almost a full 10 months. It's also the most varied competition - sometimes a team is so good they run away with it and are the clear favorites throughout the season. Sometimes, like this past 18-19 season, there are multiple teams that are neck and neck and the championship is not decided until the penultimate or even final match day.

So our overall goals are to win all the trophies that we can. The primary goal is to improve the squad and be able to compete with other great teams for the Champions League and the Premier League title. That's not realistic next season because 1) we won't be in the Champions League so we can't win it and 2) there's a gulf of quality between us and the league champions. So an achievable target for next season is finishing the season inside the ""top 4"" and qualifying for the Champions League again. Secondary goals are winning any other competitions we are in like the FA Cup, the League Cup, and the Europa League.",True,False,False,,0,1559497914,,False,0,{},eptulyu,False,t3_bvu0bn,False,True,t1_epskgg9,/r/Gunners/comments/bvu0bn/what_are_the_goals_for_next_season_new_fan_trying/eptulyu/,False,,1568766718,3,True,[],False,Gunners,t5_2qhqt,r/Gunners,public,0,

No, it isn't, it's funded by the licensing fees the people who own televisions pay.

&gt;Yes it is. See, I provided as many sources as you have.

Can you provide a primary source that corroborates your assertion that the BBC is state directed and controlled?

Because the BBC is neither paid for by the state nor does the state hold editorial control, while RT is wholly owned and operated by the Russian state.

I don't know why you'd need a source to prove the Russian government owns and operates RT, but I'll supply some anyway:

https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/rt-news/

&gt;Funded by / Ownership

&gt;RT News is owned by ANO ‚ÄúTV-Novosti‚Äù, which is funded by the Russian Government. The network is funded through advertising as well as 307 million USD from the Russian Government as of 2016.

&gt;Analysis / Bias

&gt;In review, RT News present news that is generally in line with the narrative of the Russian Government. When it comes to covering USA/International News they provide right of center coverage.  They are highly biased in favor of Russia and occasionally run Pro-state conspiracy stories. The Columbia Journalism Review calls RT ‚ÄúThe Kremlin‚Äôs propaganda outlet.‚Äù

&gt;In general, most international news stories on RT are factual and relate to true events, however there are occasional pieces that spin these facts into a different narrative, that is misleading. Another concerning aspect of RT is they do not list author information for articles published on the website. This presents a lack of transparency that makes it difficult to verify information.

https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/nov/29/24-hour-putin-people-my-week-watching-kremlin-propaganda-channel-rt-russia-today

An insight into the differences between the BBC and RT:

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/world/europe/russias-rt-network-is-it-more-bbc-or-kgb.html

And oh, look, RT registered in the U.S. as a foreign agent, interesting:

https://www.vox.com/world/2017/11/10/16633586/rt-russia-propaganda-foreign-agent

&gt;It only proves that you're trying to divert the topic away from what it's about.

This goes for all Neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism

So like, if you're black and struggling in school, what are the odds they think it's ADHD or autism? Wouldn't they be more likely to assume it's something else? There's also gender bias. My little brother and I are white and he got diagnosed at 5 when he got kicked out of every school for being a nuisence and throwing dirt in the other kids' eyes.

I flew by unnoticed until 25. classes are overcrowded, teachers are too stressed to notice I literally couldn't do math and am completely faceblind. I slipped through the cracks. At 27 I am now pursuing an autism diagnosis as well.

And I'm white. Imagine a black kid in even more overcrowded classes where everyone around them is struggling JUST as bad. The middle class is the sweet spot where you're impaired enough to be noticed but with enough money and time and energy to see a doctor and be taken seriously

We now understand most people with autism are only diagnosed when they are significantly disabled, but there are people living with autism that don't even realize it, they think they're just quirky at best or stupid/weird at worst depending on the symptoms they experience. For example, I taught myself how to read and I am hyperlexic, I could read at a college level by the time I was 10. I also have dyslexia and dyscalculia, but I get by because I can read upside down and I read so fast it doesn't matter if the letters flip on me. I am so gifted in reading it covered up the fact I can't subtract two numbers or tell time etc

I'm also the child of an Eastern European immigrant and it's likely my mother has these conditions too, she is like me.

The issue with systemic oppression is, do you think people are lenient if you are affected by your disorder? My little brother went to prison for armed robbery as an adolescent. He got off easy because he was white. I am relieved and horrified at the same time.

[],EmptyFridge123,,,,[],,,,text,t2_3nb5xju4,False,"&gt;I agree with you that from the between the battle with the Nuckaleev and the events at Shion would be weeks apart from each other and be at least a month, however, you are forgetting the first village they went to in the first ep of vol 4. It was the village where they battled the ghost grimm. There should be time between the battle of the ghost grimm and them finding Shion village. So vol 4 would be more than a month probably a month and 2-3 weeks. So they actually reach haven in mid-Oct. The one month pass in vol 5 from that time would actually have Ruby's birthday occur in vol 5 instead of after it. It would contradict Lindsays words.

Actually, the Unnamed Village which had the Geist problem was pretty damn near Shion. Shion was neighbored by another village, though they have not been in regular contact since the fall of Beacon Tower and the collapse of the Cross Continental Transmit System. They even mention this in Volume 4 Episode 1 ""The Next Step"",

&gt;**Ren:** We've heard the next village over has a working Airship.
&gt;
&gt;**Blacksmith:** Mmm, no way to know for sure. Scroll signals were weak enough out here back when Beacon Tower was still up. Haven't heard from Shion Village in a while.
&gt;
&gt;**Ruby:** Well, there's only one way to find out.



So yeah, when you take that into consideration, Volume 4 all happening in a month still fits. 


&gt;Then weeks pass with the Schnee Dust company sending out invitations, preparing for the fundraiser, and Weiss preparing a new song(rehearsals choosing instruments, etc). It would be a little over a month at the most. Then when the fundraiser happens Weiss is put under house arrest. It's from there that she spent a few more weeks training - it wouldn't take he a 1 week or two to be able to summon her Knight it would have to be more because an ability like that takes time. Overall, if you say that Weiss arc starts at the same time JNPR's arc end in vol 4 that would mean that Weiss wouldn't have met them in the month of September but more like in November and that contradicts things.

&gt;I don't think she or he meant height. Though it would still be plausible that if her arc occurred a month or so after the FoB that she would be surprise about Whitley's height, if they were talking about that - I mean she spent 2 semester roughly 8 months from seeing him. So her arc starting a little starting after the FoB is still more plausible instead of it being another 8 months when she finally sees him again in her own house or Ironwood closing the borders 8 months later instead of closing it early like his character would do.




You are correct that the SDC Gala happened a few weeks after Weiss was instructed by Jacques to perform. But it doesn't really look like it took that long for Weiss to learn Summoning. Remember that in the Battle of Beacon, Weiss was able to partially Summon the Knight's Arm and Sword to cut down an advanced Paladin. So in all honesty, it doesn't really look like it took that long for her to learn Summoning. Shortly after she does Summon the Knight, she leaves the Schnee Manor in short order. 

Not only that but if the SDC Gala hypothetically did happen 2 months after the Fall of Beacon, it would make absolutely no sense for upper class Atlas elites like Henry Marigold to struggle to remember the Fall of Beacon like that after such a short amount of time. It'd be like hearing about an upper class young man in France forgetting 9/11 happened after 2 months. Not only that but in total, Weiss's V4 Arc seems to last at most maybe 1-2 month(s) in terms of length. If it was supposed to be set a month after the Fall of Beacon, then there's still like a 6 month stretch from when Weiss leaves the Schnee Manor on her Bullhead to where  she gets attacked by Lancers and gets captured by the Branwen Tribe and the subsequently gets reunited with all her friends. And that contradicts what we see in the show because I doubt that Weiss spent 6 months on a freaking plane with Pilot Boi until they reached the Kingdom of Mistral. 

In order for Weiss's V4 Arc to fit, it'd would've had to have started either shortly before or at the same time as RNJR's V4 Arc was starting. Do you get where I'm coming from with this?

&gt;A forest would still be affected by the weather regardless of where it is. The snow would still fall and reach it if it snowed. The leaves would still change color because of the height of the mountain. The higher the altitude the colder the mountain would get. So if it is in the fall season which would cause the weather to get even more colder the leaves would be effected and change color especially if it was Oct. Leaves will change color because of the cold weather and the shortened lengths of daylight, in which, it would cause the chlorophyll to break down and change color. Since we see that the leaves are still green and bright throughout Mistral and all the way towards Raven's village, in the course of vol 4-5, it would mean that they are not in September or October but in the summer - like in August by the time vol 5 starts.


Not really, friend. I lived in India for a few years and India is a pretty tropical place. Yet I can‚Äôt recall a single day where it even snowed a little or the leaves changed color for the most part in India. In the southern part of India, you couldn‚Äôt tell the difference between winter time and summer time. The only difference was that summer was hotter and more humid. Only places that see snowfall in India are the Himalayan foothills. Most of the India lies in the tropical zone, so the snow is unheard of. Winter nights get really chilly in some places though. The states that see snowfall are : Most of Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh, and northern parts of West Bengal. And yes, parts of J&amp;K see more snow than a European or an American would ever have seen. All of these places are in the far north of India near the northern border. So it‚Äôs not impossible for a tropical place like Mistral to be similar to India in that they look pretty unaffected by Fall and Winter. The reason why Argus looks more affected by Fall and Winter could very well be because of its location up north in a snowy mountainous region near the border of Atlas, similar to how Jammu and Kashmir is located  in a snowy mountainous region near the border of Pakistan. Do you get where I'm coming from with this?

&gt;  Who would want to trade with US if it is going to be used as a weapon for various reasons? 

&amp;#x200B;

Tariffs really aren't that big of a deal, they are fees that you pay to play in a marketplace. 

&amp;#x200B;

In America the two largest marketplaces for the average citizen to participate in are Amazon and eBay. Both collect fees and steadily restructure or increase those fees and demands of compliance to in-house rules for participation. Despite these changes costing more money and frustrating their sellers, most just pay the prices, accept the increased risk associated with returns/losses and budget those cost into their selling prices because at the end of the day, those marketplaces are so enormous that seller profit significantly outweighs the losses.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the same for the American Marketplace. The added costs suck, the added risk sucks but the profit is still good enough to pay to play.  Nations facing tariffs like the Amazon and eBay sellers are annoyed, frustrated and complaining but will ultimately choose to pay to play because the profits significantly outweigh the losses. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unlike the average citizen online seller who is completely at the whim of the marketplace owners, China, Mexico and other nations have negotiating abilities to create custom seller agreements.

&amp;#x200B;

In the temporary, China is subsidizing the tariffs, Mexico can choose to do the same or they can choose to comply.

&amp;#x200B;

At the heart of this issue is ideological differences between an economic nationalist/sovereignty leaning US President and a Socialist leaning Mexican President.

Hamas is a jihadist terrorist group who‚Äôs only redeeming values are that they hate ISIS and the defeated the PA in the last elections Gazans enjoyed some 12 years ago. 

And the PA? They luxuriate in the money that the EU and the Iranians and Qataris and others pass to them so they can continue to drive their Maybachs while they do zero about the Palestinian refugees in Syria. 

Every day there‚Äôs an attack on Israelis. Every day there‚Äôs a fire kite scorching the earth. Every day there‚Äôs someone willing to go through a young girls bedroom window and slaughter her in her bed. Or throw a Molotov cocktail into an open window, scorching the face of a ten year old girl who has to wear a mask because of the facial burns. 

And you support them. 

You support the most violent anti-gay leadership in the known world. You support a terrorist organization. You support the corrupt government that would pay a family because they brainwashed their son to blow up himself and three girls eating pizza.

Your percentages seem to be the most off, but perhaps the numbers match up to the bbc and wikipedia ones.

Fine, Labour aren't a hard Brexit supporting party, but their official line is still Brexit. They are opposed to no deal however, but this hardly puts them in line with the other Brexit parties. If anything, you could put them as neutral, but to put them as a remain party is a falsehood. (I can't remember for certain but I don't even think there is a guarantee that their option of the people's vote will have an option to remain.)

Let's hypothetically take Labour away from the situation then because it will have had Leave and Remain voters voting for it because of their deliberately muddled policy:

BREX/UKIP/CON still on 44 (42.5 if you go by my numbers)

LDs/Green/CUK/SNP/Plaid on 40.4 (39.2)

Even if you take Labour away there is still more support for Brexit parties than Remain parties. We disagree on where Labour should be placed, and I imagine there are some breakdowns of their voters to see which are Leave and which are Remain which could narrow it down, but then we're really getting to margins which would not show a clear majority for one way or the other.

Being able to not take yourself too seriously and enjoying discord banter is definitely a plus.

We also have a back up crew named Macula for when our members need to take a break from the game or have to skip a guild war because of real life but still want to remain in our community and keep some crew buffs without hurting the main crew GW performance.

The requirements to join Europa are the following :

* Rank 150
* Joining discord
* Being active
* Doing your part during Guild war as expected of a Tier A player

All our ships have :

* 30% charge boost at start
* 20% boost to drop rates
* 2 green potions
* 10% elemental bonus damage
* %XP bonus for magnafest EMP sliming

Cholera fun fact I: the first global Cholera pandemic (1817-1824) was the result of a chain reaction, started by the outbreak of the [Tambora volcano 1815](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1815_eruption_of_Mount_Tambora) . The chain reaction went something like this: huge ass volcano outbreak in Indonesia - ash spreads all over the stratosphere, blocking more sunlight - lowscale global volcanic winter - disruption of the seasonal monsoons in India - lower temperatures and bad harvests globally during the next 3 years - millions of deaths due to starvation (India and Europe) and/or freezing to death (North America), the worst famines in the northern hemisphere of the 19th century - resulting lower immune systems of general population in affected areas - a new strain of cholera (which only used to be a regional phenomenon in India before) started in Bengal and spread like a wildfire - globalized markets (esp. within the British Empire) spread the disease to Europe, Eastern Asia and the Americas - again millions of deaths - tadaa that's how you get a pandemic.

Cholera fun fact II: the name of the British doctor who first proved that Cholera was caused by bacteria in drinking water was John Snow. No joke.

The moral of the story: it's gonna be good fun when the next Tambora scale volcano breaks out. Vesuvius is a good candidate, it's been quieter recently. One big outbreak like in 79 CE, and it's Mayhem all over the world.

The economy was ruthlessly exploited. [...] To feed the insatiable appetite of the war machine entire forests were cut down. The demand for workers was met through forced labour‚Äîin 1917 amounting to about 60,000 on Lithuanian territory. Potentially, all men and women were subject to forced labour as from 26 June 1916, so the true number might have been far higher. When instructions to report to labour camps were ignored, people were simply rounded up in raids. The conditions for the forced labour were harsh, and the rations amounted to only 250 grams of bread and a litre of soup‚Äîat most 700 calories, a starvation diet. Public corporal punishment, also of women, and torture in the prisons, were routinely employed to force people to respect the occupiers. The consequences of the exploitation were impoverishment, famine, and epidemics in which thousands died in winter 1917‚Äì18.

Alan Kramer, *Dynamic of Destruction*, pages 47-8.

It's not even like ""potential"" abuses. They were *already* abusing the places they were occupying. The pattern was very similar in occupied Belgium and Northeastern France. A German victory, in the words of Dr. Gary Sheffield, would have been an even bigger tragedy than the war already was. Of course whatever they didn't would have been on the same scale or wavelength as WW2 - but that's because the goals and ideas at play were different.

Yes and No. It is impossible to be accurate without knowing of you way of traveling. It depends how much you drink, how many attractions you want to see, what you eat (restaurants all the time or bread from supermarket), how do you move around the city. The budgets seems to be reasonable to me for a backpacker what skips expensive attractions and don't drink much. 

In order get better estimate you have to break down your cost. Check hostel/hotel prices, check attraction prices, check ""cheap eats"" prices, groceries cost quite similar in Europe (+-20% you can check flyers from lidl for most of the countries eg. www.lidl.de), transport prices.

First, it's always a joy to see the vast majority of the NoSleep cast deployed so effectively. This episode was a good opportunity for an ensemble cast and everyone who showed up was incorporated well. Mick Wingert (who I just watched/heard voice Slappy in ""Goosebumps 2"") aptly carried the lengthy story. And the Steven King scenario (his *The Mist* mixed with (not his) *Alive*, the one about the true story story of the crashed Uruguayan rugby team that resorted to cannibalism) was ripe for a creative approach to horror. My favorite segment was the opening series of bus rides, which settled me into the narrative as I got to know the array of characters. And kudos to Phil Michalski for handling such an impressive production.

But once the story settled down into tribalism and cannibalism at the Whitefall bus station, it didn't go anywhere interesting, I thought.

I have to give some personal background. I'm a vegetarian (with heavily-reduced dairy consumption) due to ethical concerns regarding energy consumption and the factory farming industry. (I also regularly take a fish oil supplement because the science isn't very strong about being able to get certain necessary omega acids from plants, which technically makes me a pescatarian, but I'm willing to cut myself some slack there.) Not shouting all that out to preach obnoxiously. It's just relevant to my reaction here. Anyway, even with all that said, I'd be perfectly willing to eat meat if I had to in order to survive. If I'm in a situation where people are starving and no other options are available, cannibalism also strikes me as a perfectly reasonable course of action of last resort. That's apparent throughout history, from early time to the first European settlers in what would become the United States to prisoners-of-war in Russia and Eastern Europe in World War II.

So, it seemed obvious from the start that these stranded characters would have to resort to cannibalism once their food ran out, and that seemed like a reasonable and ethical choice. I don't doubt it would be a horrific thing to go through. But the horror of it never really gripped me, as what they were doing just struck me as a common and understandable survival tactic for stranded people. The episode even spared us (perhaps intentionally to make us imagine something more horrific) the details of the process of cutting up and cooking the deceased for meat. It could have been more gruesome and felt like a watered-down *The Road*.

Otherwise, what did the episode provide? Well, the narrative was rife with fairly conservative gender roles. I don't mean that particularly critically. The narrator and others stick up for Gracie when she was harassed and sexually assaulted, and good on them for doing so. The narrator needed to learn that he has to do anything to survive for the sake of caring for his girlfriend and providing for his child, rather than running away from his obligations like he had initially intended. And that's nice too. We also get our protagonist in a leadership position within his group that he didn't really deserve, which is a whole other story.

The more interesting horror, I thought, was the concept of being stranded in an endless blizzard from which no one ever returns, with an absent corporate voice ringing out platitudes about enjoying coffee and tea, while our hero makes phone calls to his girlfriend that he isn't sure she can even hear. That's a setting for horror gold, right there. The phenomenal horror game *Concluse* nailed a similar concept.

Instead, we get lots of cliches about people dividing into tribes, including a by-the-books sequence where characters barter food for soda (and cigarettes? are there really a lot of people in this scenario willing to trade food for cigarettes?) - ""I'll give you __ for __"" ""Are you crazy? People are dying! We need more!"" etc. And the story villainizes the people first to recognize that cannibalism is a necessary survival strategy while our hero alone holds out til the end. The story fittingly references ""Lord of the Flies,"" but ""Lord of the Flies"" had more symbolism and insight.

And the ending...it was a weird hybrid between ""it was all a dream"" and the described events actually transpiring that didn't work, at least it didn't for me. I can buy that the characters would get into a trance and just get on their buses, but the idea of Whitefall never existing doesn't make any sense for a multitude of reasons (wasn't it listed as a stop on the narrator's ticket at the beginning? why did the buses stop and eventually pick people up from there?), nor does a blistering storm isolating people for that long without government intervention (though I suppose it is rural North Dakota), or time not really passing, etc. But, how could all these people have died at a place and in a time that isn't real? I think the narrator mentions an investigation, but with so many people disappearing, presumably in a series of events some of the survivors would describe honestly, would occupy national news for a long time, and I don't think the epilogue ever dealt with that in a way that made sense or seemed plausible.

I think the remaining option is just to step back and see it all as a vague metaphor, or an inexplicable detour into hell that the survivors all decided to bury within themselves, but the convoluted epilogue coupled with a narrative that I think didn't go in the most interesting direction just made the whole experience a little tough for me to find satisfying.

That we're all animals inside willing to fight and even resort to cannibalism for survival may seem novel to some, but it's something I've always accepted. Like, I obviously didn't really care about it, but I thought the narrator was technically 
less justified in eating a bunch of (presumably non-veggie) burgers at the end than he would have been in eating human flesh during the story, because his only options earlier were to starve or eat the remains of the deceased, whereas, at the end, he had other options.

That said, it was 2.5 hours well-spent. I didn't hate it. It played out as a vivid nightmare. The NoSleep Podcast delivers a huge variety of content, and I don't have to love everything. In fact, I thought the whole season was pretty good and hope there will be a season review thread soon. But as finales go, I didn't really go for this one. And, obviously, my personal views are a significant part of that, so I don't really blame the show either and I'm overall very happy with what the NoSleep crew delivered this season.",True,False,False,,0,1559510732,,False,0,{},epujmzd,False,t3_bvou0i,False,False,t3_bvou0i,/r/TheNSPDiscussion/comments/bvou0i/discussion_nosleep_podcast_s12e25/epujmzd/,False,,1568778492,18,True,[],False,TheNSPDiscussion,t5_ql9dr,r/TheNSPDiscussion,public,0,

My disagreement (and honestly it would take formal trials to prove or disprove) with the ""gut microbiome theory"" actually is threefold:

a) Again, we're finding so much evidence that there is an actual *genetic reason* (actually, an entire series of genes) that doesn't point so much towards ""gut microbiome"" as ""something odd happens with cellular differentiation very, very, very, *very* early in development"".

The kicker for me (that lends away from any potential influence of gut microbiomes) is the fact we're actually finding evidence this happens as early as *placental development*--meaning that the seed for whatever happens with cellular differentiation in ASDs actually was set *before pregnancy*.  (And when I mean the placenta forms early, I mean it--it starts forming almost at the point multicellular development begins in an embryo and implantation occurs; it's actually the *very first* organ that differentiates, [with the initial differentiation as early as day 3 after fertilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placenta#/media/File:HumanEmbryogenesis.svg).  There is realistically not a whole lot that can even *occur* that can actually cause *changes in placental development from the very earliest stages of a pregnancy* that ISN'T genetic that won't actually cause a pregnancy to be lost altogether before the mother knows she's pregnant.)

b) I am not convinced any influence in microbiomes is causation even if there is correlation.  One of the very things that happens with ASDs--anymore it's pretty much neurologically considered *the* defining factor--is that there is a higher degree of interconnectivity of neurons and less of a separation of ""signal"" between neural pathways.  (This actually gives a biological explanation for a lot of stuff people with ASDs live with every day--overstimulation to the point physical touch or certain foods/colours/sounds can be actually *painful*, undersensitivity to stimuli in other cases, occasional synesthesia, etc.)

We know this is how the brain of people with ASDs work as we've been actually able to do live-time neural mapping using PET scans.  (Neurotypical people tend to have set, defined pathways (almost like a conventional network) whilst the brains of folks with ASDs tend to resemble more of a data center topology with multiple routes to the same thing (with occasional CRC hiccups and route flapping).)

One of the consequences of this is that people with ASDs actually in some cases physically feel sensations much more intensely (again, to put it in networking terms, all those extra connections can sometimes form essentially the equivalent of a port-channel--a bunch of connections ""bundled"" together acting like a bigger connection).

IF a brain-gut connection exists with ASDs, it's actually much more likely that a person with an ASD actually is receiving messages of (say) inflammation and the like that a neurotypical brain would essentially dismiss as white noise--in other words, it's just as likely that it's not the gut microbiome CAUSING ASD but an inflammation caused by certain gut microbiomes is essentially making *symptoms* of a pre-existing ASD worse.  (And *that* should EASILY be treatable by the modalities we have to change gut microbiomes, such as is used for treatment of certain types of colitis.)

3) Gut microbiome changes do not explain why there is a very strong link with parental age at birth and ASDs in offspring (that has been in fact discovered in a disparate number of groups worldwide--most with very, very different gut biomes and microbiomes--and is in fact separately associated with maternal age AND paternal age such that we know parental age has SOMETHING to do with it).  Parental age at conception *is* strongly associated with one thing (genetic mutations, which go up with parental age), and I actually find it stretching credulity that somehow Danish, Thai, Australian, Jamaican, AND New Yorker groups *all* have identical changes in gut biome and microbiome that would supposedly cause an ASD.

(Incidentially, you mentioned food additives--technically there should be a lower rate of ASDs in Europe versus literally everywhere else and a shockingly high rate in China, because even a lot of GRAS food colouring agents common in the US and Asia (especially certain red dyes) are actually banned in the EU.  Canada should theoretically have a distinctly different rate of ASDs versus the US due to different legality of food additives.  The Amish and certain Hasidim communities and especially Rastafarians should have the lowest rate of ASDs recorded, especially the latter due to Rastafari dietary requirements towards nonprocessed foods in Ital cooking.

(None of these are the case; the Amish not only do get ASDs but actually have an entire subset of ""Anabaptist Heritage Diseases"" and [at least some genes explicitly linked to ASDs have in fact been found in ""Plain Folk"" communities](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-amish-dont-get-autism/), and there are sufficient numbers of kids with ASDs in the homeland of Rastafarianism that they can get enough together and show an association with likelihood of ASDs and parental age at conception.)

And again--I'll point you above in noting that *almost the entirety of any ""rise"" in diagnosis of ASDs is almost entirely due to improved diagnostic criteria*, NOT that some external cause is somehow making a huge rise in the numbers of folks with ASDs.  (Keep in mind even ""Kanner autism"" only has existed as a diagnostic category since the late  40s, and it was actually considered a type of *schizophrenia* well into the seventies.  We literally didn't even know the neurological basis of how the brains of people with ASDs WORKED until about five to ten years ago!)

Heck, I'm even willing to make a bet that whenever DSM-VI is published  about 15 years from now and when early-detection tests for ASDs designed for use in infants (as in six- to twelve-month old babies) become part of routine well-baby exams that the likes of Autism Speaks are going to be positively screaming blue murder on how OH MY GOD THE AUTISM RATE HAS *TRIPLED!!!111one!* simply because of the availability of evaluation criteria that do a better job of finding people with an ASD--especially *girls* with ASDs, of which fully *three out of four* do not get an appropriate diagnosis of an ASD but are misdiagnosed.  No, seriously.

You probably even believe that. I have never met someone in real life who voted Leave that has since decided they want to Remain. These people are so rare that the offensively-named Peoples Vote pressure group made a promotion out of an ""every day guy"" who said he had voted Leave but now wanted to Remain now ""because he had learned more"" (hey, just like the propaganda says!) who then turned out to have been a massive Remainer who was spamming pro-EU shit all over his Facebook before the 2016 vote. Embarrassing. These ex-Leavers are so rare that a well funded PR outfit literally cannot find even one!! And I have met many people who say ""I voted Remain but we have to Leave because that side won"". Democracy still matters to a lot of people, even if the hard Remain side openly doesn't care about that any more. Maybe we should have a new rule where we re-run general elections if the big banks don't like the result? And then you can get in to how stunned and angry the 17.4M people who voted Leave in good faith are... not that you care about that. They're all racists and idiots, right?

&gt; WW2 and by extension the cold war happened because the allies punished Germany way too harshly so i'm not sure how that helps your argument. 

I imagine you‚Äôre referring to the Versalles treaty, which I would agree was exceptionally harsh. Equally as harsh as the treaty that the Germans had imposed on Russia the prior year for that matter. However, I wouldn‚Äôt say that treaty was the reason WWII happened. Again, it‚Äôs complex. I know you don‚Äôt like that word, but there are lots of variables that contributed. Fascism was all the rage in Europe at the time. Antisemitism was a problem. Stalin was in power in the USSR by then and had plans to invade Eastern Europe, which he did in 1939. Let‚Äôs not forget about what Japan was doing in Asia. And Italy in Ethiopia. But no, you want to blame the West.  

&gt; You just keep saying it's complex it's complex but you're not elaborating lol. You just say it's complex. It's obviously complex, no shit, but that doesn't mean it's not fucking easy to see how Western imperialism caused this shit

My point is you keep blaming **only** the West. There are other factors involved. I‚Äôm guessing you didn‚Äôt grow up during the Cold War? That basically drove geopolitics for 40 years. Arming the mujadeen for example, that was a proxy fight against the soviets. It later bit us in the ass with bin Laden but hindsight is always 20/20 isn‚Äôt it? Korea was a proxy war. The US did good in stopping communist aggression there and it made sense at the time to later do the same in Vietnam. Boy, was that a bad call. You don‚Äôt want to look at the big picture, you just want to say ‚ÄúUS foreign policy bad‚Äù. 

&gt; you're ignoring how geopolitics in MENA were shaped by Britain during the colonial period where they helped install the most conservative Muslims into power because they were friendly to Western interests. The Ayatollah in Iran for example only came to power because we overthrew the democratically elected government and imposed a pro-Western shah.

I‚Äôm not ignoring the british role in the Middle East, they made a mess of it but that‚Äôs not the sole reason the Middle East has been a shit show.

And then there‚Äôs Islam, which the lefties always give a free pass to. This has always confused me because conservative Islam flies in the face of progressive western ideals. I‚Äôm talking about women‚Äôs rights, gay rights, freedom of speech, separation of church and state, religious tolerance. That‚Äôs not to say there aren‚Äôt places of Muslim majority that are tolerant and somewhat liberal minded, I‚Äôm just saying that there is a very strong undercurrent of intolerance that often manifests itself. I‚Äôm sure we could agree this is true with Christianity, but you would likely give Islam a free pass for some reason. 

**TLDR:** You wonder why people call you a tankie, it‚Äôs because you argue the same talking points that tankies do: blame all the world‚Äôs problems on either Israel, British colonialism, or US foreign policy.

Look, u/dayafternextfriday I was a full-blown, really powered up feminist. And I honestly thought that the wage gap was a terrible thing. here the truth tho. Women do get paid less. but the wage gap doesn't take into consideration the fact that men are more likely to work overtime (again, more likely, not that women won't), that men are more likely to work riskier and therefore higher paying jobs. There is a reason men are 96% of workplace-related deaths, and are several times more likely to die in the workplace. Men also retire later (on average). So there it is. Now, if you take into account all of this, then the wage gap is 99 cents to the dollar. So, alright, that's still an issue and it **needs to be addressed**, but it's mostly attributed to men being a bit better at negotiating wages than women (last time I checked, and on average). So, the solution is to teach women and men better negotiation skills so that they can get better wages!

Take into consideration one last thing: If jobs did pay women less then men for equal work, companies would only hire women. Companies have their first priority as making money. So why don't they if they legally can?

Wife and I just returned from a two week trip to Morocco. We spent 5 nights in Marrakech (with two days trips - one to the coastal town of Essaouira and the berber villages in the Atlas mountains), 4 nights in Fes, 2 nights in the desert, 2 nights in Chefchaouen (the blue city), and one night in Rabat.

*Flights:*

a) Redeemed AA gift cards to the tune of \~$1,250 to fly SFO-JFK in J, thanks to 4x CNB Crystal Visa and 2x Amex Plat airline incidental credits.

b) Transferred 176k Citi TYPs to Emirates to book Royal Air Maroc from JFK to Casablanca for two in J with \~$400 in taxes per person (unfortunately)

c) Redeemed my CNB Crystal Visa 75k SUB for travel on Jetblue Mint JFK to SFO on return, after paying the difference of \~$200 in cash after points were exhausted.

*Hotels / Riads:*

Mostly stayed in boutique riads along the way, paying cash for the properties, but I did manage to put my Marriott 7 night category 1-4 rewards certificate to good use for the 5 night stay in Marrakech, at the AnaYela design hotel. I can't recommend this property enough. It's a five-room property with extremely personalized service - Moroccan mint tea on demand, private dining on the patio for dinner when you tell the hotel on the day (thereafter which they go and do the shopping for the ingredients), and a beautiful small pool in the center of the property.

Citi FNF booking at the Riad Fes, a fabulous Relais&amp;Chateaux property. Booking through Citi's concierge I was able to stack the hotels FNF promotion with Citi's bringing the cost down to approx \~$780 for four nights total.

*Highlights and lowlights:*

\- Don't be fooled by the fabulous photos of Morocco; it is very third-world and fairly dirty. My wife was under a different impression heading into this trip (where she chose the destination).

\- Sleeping in the desert was a fabulous experience, and the sand dunes really are something to behold. However, I felt it was overrated relative to the cost of EUR 800 total for two nights including transport to the middle of nowhere and back.

\- Moroccan food is meh, and I've realized that we require ""food culture"" on our trips to really experience the culture.

\- You will get lost many times in the old medina of Marrakech and Fes. The smaller medina's in Rabat and Chefchaouen were much more navigable.

\- Royal Air Maroc in J was great. Nothing to write home about but service was good, food was excellent and the cabin was mostly empty.

\- JetBlue Mint is definitely the best transcontinental J flight you can take. Unfortunately we were delayed by just under 6hrs, so I couldn't test my CNB Crystal Visa trip delay protection out.

\- Going during the holy month of Ramadan is not an issue - most places worth visiting are still open as tourism is a big industry.

\- It's not that cheap, thanks to the proliferation of French and other European tourists.

They believe they were beaten in 2016 because of a dislikable candidate who wasn't radical enough. In my humble opinion, they're mistaken ‚Äì which I believe the mid-terms have shown. The reason why we hear so much about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar is they're the only flag-bearers of the intersectional coalition out there.

Generally speaking, the left ‚Äì both America's and abroad's ‚Äì is yet to realize they've maneuvred themselves into a position not unlike the right's at the height of McCarthyism.

In other words, their policies caused Trumpism and more of the same isn't going to force that genie back into its bottle again.

All equally worth something. All equally deserving of being treated with respect and good faith until proven otherwise.

Even their lazy attempts to win back voters or rationalize the right's successes are often ripe with contempt, though. We Europeans got a ripe dose of that last week. If your analysis of an electoral defeat is to suggest you only lost to the right-wing because you failed to explain your policies enough in a more relatable manner, all you're suggesting is that only dim-witted people would vote for the right and that more people, surely, would've had voted for you if only they had seen the superiority of your policies.

&amp;#x200B;

However, you don't win elections by being that arrogant, and you don't win elections by denigrating people who didn't vote for you.

&amp;#x200B;

Trump, on the other hand, gives folks a feeling of certainty he doesn't want to change them. Either you agree with him, that's fine ‚Äì or you don't, and then he doesn't care. That's his strength.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides, the public has begun to dig into the left's ideological inconsistencies, and they haven't found a recipe yet to deal with that development. I'm not saying the right doesn't have any (they most certainly do), but the Democrats have climbed on too high a horse for the right's nonsense to matter as much in the public's eye.

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, as a Democrat you'd have a hard time explaining to the public how a party could be sexist that makes a tremendous female trailblazer in Martha McSally a senator (the first female combat pilot of the United States Armed Forces). You'd have a hard time explaining to the public that it is you who fights racism although you use objectively racist language yourself (albeit against an ethnic majority).

&amp;#x200B;

The point is, I think Trump's going to win because the Democrats are ideologically unable of questioning their own strategy.

Bisognerebbe saltare sul treno delle rinnovabili e dell'efficienza energetica - una cosa talvolta gi√† fatta ma in maniera saltuaria, con poca convinzione. Mi riferisco all'intero ciclo dell'efficienza energetica: i trasporti, pubblici e privati, la climatizzazione degli ambienti domestici, la gestione del ciclo dei rifiuti: carburanti, bollette, tariffe rifiuti sono tra i pi√π grossi accolli delle famiglie italiane.

Seconda cosa, √® davvero necessario che le multinazionali paghino le tasse che devono pagare. L'elusione crea un grosso danno allo Stato e ai cittadini, a tutto vantaggio di grandi aziende che spesso non sono nemmeno europee.

Investimenti sulla logistica e sui trasporti, entro l'Italia e da e per l'Italia. I paesi di successo dominano i settori della logistica e dei trasporti - quindi produzione e commercio - il ruolo degli altri Stati √® residuale.

Il gioco d'azzardo (che viene spesso definita anche tassa sulla stupidit√†) √® una piaga che ha impoverito gli italiani in maniera trasversale. √à vero che lo Stato Italiano lo usa per sostenere i costi del proprio debito pubblico, ma di fatto un Male viene curato con un altro Male, maiuscole volute perch√© se lo meritano. Lo Stato dovrebbe cercare altre vie per mantenere (se non ridurre, utopia) il proprio debito pubblico.

Ci sono poi delle questioni terra terra, che riguardano le abitudini dei singoli cittadini.

Basically amounted to watch out for foreigners or people asking if you have a passport in the South area. I did once end up in a truck with a foreigner who was asking me about my passport so that was quite terrifying haha, I did not end up getting trafficked as I insisted on getting off even if it meant walking from the middle of a forest to the nearest gas station.

&amp;#x200B;

These days it's far more straightforward and hard to avoid, as the majority are done from the EU or using local intermediaries. My best advice is to thoroughly look up any job offer abroad before you go, and to remember the phone numbers to trafficking helplines before going abroad. Unfortunately, in many cases the intermediaries are people such as relatives, local church pastors, people on councils etc. so there is no one you can really fully trust it seems. No real way to avoid getting trafficked, but if you're lucky you learn about how to run away from it. A lot of traffickers rely on you being too afraid to seek help,as they will confiscate your paperwork and threaten to kill your family. They will \*not\* kill your family as they have other victims to attend to, and the local governments will not put you in jail if you do not have the proper paperwork.

&amp;#x200B;

What you want to do is thoroughly check the paperwork for any job you might be offered abroad, and never go unless you have the contract scanned and checked by a local authority. You can call the local government to ask if the company is legit, look up reviews, etc. Most places do not go through the trouble of making up a real company as most people do not even check. If you do not speak the language or at least good English then just don't go abroad. Also, if you have a foreign boyfriend who wants to take you abroad, no matter how in love you are, do not go unless you have a safety net.

I live in Europe and no one here has ever said anything that would suggest people don't recognise and appreciate what the US did. I wonder if the problem you have is more to do with how you perceive people's comments. Like I read one comment here, presumably from a US guy, that said something along the lines of: if it wasn't for us then you'd all be Nazis.

Now yeah you bet I take offense at that because it's a stupid distorted one-sided perspective. Yes it's probably true but just as equally true is me saying:

If it wasn't for Britain and Russia, the US would now be surrounded by a Japanese empire on one side and a Nazi empire on the other. There'd be no D-Day if Britain fell and if Russia fell, Britain probably would have also. Both could have occurred before the US entered the war. With the Nazis winning in Europe, America suddenly find itself alone in a totally different new world order.

So I wonder if you consider me saying that to be ""bitching""? Is bitching just when someone thinks your viewpoint is innacurate? Or am I bitching right now simply by disagreeing with you?

Bitching isn't trying to correct someone when you feel their viewpoint is distorted.

Bitching is when you say something stupid like, ""Piss off, American soldiers didn't even know how to fight. They're pissy cowards who ran away at the first sound of gun fire.""

&gt;Hardly a day seems to go by without another candidate entering the ‚Äúrace‚Äù to be leader of the Conservative Party. We say race but this is beginning to look more like the Charge of the Light Brigade. One can only hope that it will have a better outcome, but that will depend on whether the contenders charge in the right direction and at the right target.

&gt;As this list has grown and grown, what has gone missing is the important point that this leadership election is about picking the next Prime Minister. Those who have thrown their hats into the ring, with minimum support but imbued with an enormous sense of self-worth, need to think a little more carefully. After all, whoever gets selected won‚Äôt have the space that a leader of the opposition has to develop into the job, to become known to the public, or to learn the ropes of government.

&gt;Instead, the new Prime Minister will not only face the onerous task of resolving Brexit but also of running a Cabinet that has looked depressingly and dangerously dysfunctional in recent weeks. They will need to give new energy and direction to a government that seems to have lost its way across a range of crucial areas. It is genuinely questionable whether some of those who have declared have done so with any real understanding of any of this or they recognise the difference between leadership in opposition and becoming Prime Minister.

&gt;The 1922 Committee, it is hoped, will step in to sort out what commentators are beginning to call a farce. Yet whoever becomes Prime Minister will have to face the fact that it is impossible to overstate the precarious position the Tory party is in. It is teetering on the brink and we should remember the fate of the Progressive Conservatives in Canada in 1993 ‚Äì we do not have a right to govern or even exist as a party. The next PM will need real authority and a clear road map.

&gt;Of course there are a whole set of non-Brexit challenges we face domestically, such as the growing problems of social care, police funding, the armed forces and student fees. But none of this can be dealt with until we deliver Brexit as we promised.

&gt;The party has fudged and slurred its way through often quite contrary positions over the EU in the past. Too many candidates now standing have simply failed to grasp that fudging and slurring is no longer an option. In failing to grasp the enormity of the referendum result, we have connived in our own destruction.

&gt;More than that, many in the party are concerned that the Cabinet members now standing are responsible for the chaos just before the European Parliament elections. As Theresa May brought back her Withdrawal Bill, which included a commitment to a second referendum, these Cabinet members did nothing and sealed our fate at the elections. By staying in Cabinet and failing to stop the referendum sell-out, they must shoulder much of the blame for our terrible collapse.

&gt;Not leaving on March 29 infuriated the public. In the European elections, the voters reminded us that they were no longer prepared to see the establishment betray their vote.

&gt;Yet candidates are answering the wrong question. They are being asked: do they want no deal and, if not, then what? Their answers have been all over the place. Some have chosen the ridiculous position of saying no deal would be a disaster but that we must keep it on the table, while others have said they are prepared to leave without a deal.

&gt;Yet to cut through the guff and understand their actual position, the real question is far simpler. What we need to know is: are they prepared to rule out now a further extension of Article 50 beyond October 31? For that is what will define this debate. Our only chance of rebuilding our prospects depends on our delivering Brexit at the latest by October 31.

&gt;Knowing that we cannot go on past Oct 31 means we must be prepared not just to negotiate our future relationship with the EU but also in parallel must have ensured that we are fully ready to leave on that date, come what may. This will mean putting in place a myriad of practical arrangements to ensure we leave as smoothly as possible without the failings of the existing Withdrawal Agreement.

&gt;This leadership election must result in three things for the party: the delivery of Brexit no later than 31 October; capitalism to set people free, tempered by social justice; and strong leadership that can communicate and enthuse.

Erdogan has rarely been so weak at home‚Äîor so aggressive with his neighbors in the Mediterranean.

BY YIANNIS BABOULIAS | MAY 21, 2019, 12:57 PM

When Berat Albayrak, Turkey‚Äôs finance minister and the son-in-law of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, announced on May 12 that his country would soon send a drill ship to exploit natural gas resources in an area widely considered to belong to Cyprus, it was tempting to write off the incident as just another harmless flare-up in the decadeslong territorial disputes in the Eastern Mediterranean. Periodically stoking tensions with Greece and Cyprus has always been a part of Turkish foreign-policy strategy.

This time is far more dangerous, however, because there are signs Turkey might be ready to escalate its confrontation beyond mere rhetoric. Albayrak‚Äôs announcement came a day before Turkey held Sea Wolf, its largest annual naval exercise in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean. Then, on May 15, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu reiterated the country‚Äôs intention to buy the S-400 missile system from Russia. And throughout this period, Turkish jets have been violating Greek airspace almost daily.

The S-400 purchase has been a source of tension on its own. The United States and NATO believe that the missile system, once plugged into Turkey‚Äôs radar network, will give Russian systems access to sensitive NATO data‚Äîpotentially making it easier, for instance, for Moscow to detect the F-35s that Turkey has been looking to procure from the West. Turkey claims those concerns are overblown, but that hasn‚Äôt stopped Washington from threatening Ankara with removal from the F-35 purchasing program and further sanctions.

All this, again, could be seen simply as part of the generally problematic relationship between Turkey and the West following the events of the Gezi Park protests and the escalation of the war in Syria, when Erdogan began consolidating power at home almost six years ago. But recent local elections in Istanbul‚Äîin which Erdogan lost the city he considers his seat of power‚Äîhave clearly spooked the once unshakeable strongman, causing him to overreach and force a rerun. This looks likely to backfire, with opposition parties withdrawing their candidates and throwing their support behind the Republican People‚Äôs Party‚Äôs Ekrem Imamoglu, who was the winner of the first round.

This comes amid an economy in decline, as reflected in the price of the Turkish lira, and grumbling about Erdogan inside his own party. The frosty reception the president got when he visited Turkey-aligned Northern Cyprus last year also didn‚Äôt help his standing at home.

These are developments that Erdogan was clearly not ready for. Turks may ultimately benefit from their autocratic president‚Äôs sudden weakening. But as far as international politics go, the effects are far more ambiguous. History suggests that leaders who are losing their grip on power have incentives to organize a show of strength and unite their base behind an imminent foreign threat. Erdogan has every reason to create hostilities with Greece‚ÄîTurkey‚Äôs traditional adversary and Cyprus‚Äôs ally‚Äî to distract from his problems at home.

This wouldn‚Äôt come out of nowhere. Turkey has never allowed Cyprus to benefit from the natural gas reserves in its waters without some sort of confrontation. In that sense, Turkey‚Äôs strategy in the Aegean Sea has been consistent for many decades now: apply pressure, put forth demands, wait for a crisis, and then bring the other side to the table on your own terms. This is precisely what it‚Äôs trying to do in Cyprus right now. ‚ÄúWhat is developing before our eyes is a systematic strategy engineered by Turkey to bring into question the status quo in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean regions,‚Äù wrote Alexis Papachelas, one of Greece‚Äôs most senior and well-respected journalists, in his column on May 15. ‚ÄúAll evidence points to a climax in tensions next autumn.‚Äù

It‚Äôs hard to say what the limits of the current confrontation might be. The present conditions make for a dangerous mix. Erdogan has steadily moved Turkey away from the Western institutions it belongs to (NATO) and the ones it once aspired to be a part of (the European Union) and closer to Russia as he attempts to portray himself as a regional leader in the Middle East. Meanwhile, Cyprus and Greece are both members in good standing of the EU. Indeed, Greece has moved closer to the United States and NATO than it has at any time in the past four decades. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has promoted stronger ties with both Israel and Egypt, Cyprus‚Äôs partners in its natural gas ventures.

Europe has an important role to play in deterring a conflict. The EU‚Äôs foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, has expressed ‚Äúgreat concern‚Äù over Turkey‚Äôs plans. ‚ÄúWe call urgently on Turkey to show restraint, respect the sovereign rights of Cyprus in its exclusive economic zone and refrain from any such illegal action to which the EU will respond appropriately and in full solidarity with Cyprus,‚Äù she said last week, while in January, French President Emmanuel Macron had said that France supports Cyprus‚Äô right to gas deposits off its coast, despite Turkey‚Äôs objections. The EU‚Äôs current approach to protecting its borders, however, is unlikely to be enough to deter Erdogan.

There are broader geopolitical stakes for Europe. In case of an escalation, including any sort of military conflict, wavering by Cyprus‚Äôs and Greece‚Äôs allies will invalidate the choices made by the two EU members to strengthen their ties with the West and create further doubt about NATO‚Äôs effectiveness.

None of this is to suggest that the EU has always handled Turkey and Erdogan as well as it could have, or that Greece, Cyprus, and Israel haven‚Äôt made decisions of their own that have raised tensions in the region. But those arguments are not relevant to the present situation. The road map Erdogan is following is of his own creation, as are the seeds of his troubles. In responding to his provocations, Europe must now take a levelheaded but firm approach, one that leaves no room for doubt that Cyprus and Greece have allies on their side. That will do more to dissuade an escalation than any attempt to appease a troubled Erdogan with concessions.",True,False,False,,0,1559518357,,False,0,{},epux2cn,False,t3_bw1xax,False,True,t3_bw1xax,/r/worldnews/comments/bw1xax/turkey_is_hungry_for_war_with_cyprus/epux2cn/,False,,1568784803,1,True,[],False,worldnews,t5_2qh13,r/worldnews,public,0,

&gt;Trump literally said Erdogan ""does things the right way"".

A cherry picked phrase for maximum fake news.

&gt;Trump literally praised Orban saying he's doing a ""tremendous job"".

And the democratically elected leader of Hungary is doing a tremendous job protecting his nation, almost zero attacks by radical islamists as the rest of Europe is suffering on a regular basis.

&gt;These ""leaders"" are oppressing their population. They are fascists, and are all actively working against democracy an free press in their countries.

Clearly true about Kim.  Less so with Erdogan.  What would you recommend?  That Trump kick an ally out of NATO?  You scream that he's attacking allies, but then complain about the leader of a NATO country that NATO should act against if they feel the need to, that's not Trump's job.  There an ally, but you want attacks?  WTF?  Make up your delusional mind.  Orban is a democratically elected leader and no other EU country has leveled charges of fascism against him, so where are you getting this shit from?

&gt;They jail any journalist that criticizes their government, and promote fear-mongering and polarisation.

Kim does yes.  Erdogan does, yes.  Orban not so much.  No one is lavishing praise on Kim or Erdogan except fake news that you buy into.

&gt;These are the people Trump looks up to for inspiration.

Fake news.  Not at all true.

&gt;These are the people Trump praises and hugs up to.  

Trump treats our NATO allies as required by NATO.  Trump was calling Kim Rocket Man just a few short months ago, I doubt he get any inspiration from the guy who regularly kills his staff and mistreats his people.  WTF did Obama do to get Otto Warmbier back?  Zero, Zip, Nada, not a fucking thing, nor did he place sanctions on Kim, only Trump has done that, and in your delusional bi polar world putting sanctions on a brutal dictator and parking massive naval assets just off his coast equals 'hugging up'.

&gt;That is not Trump being ""strong"" or ""making America great"", that is Trump fancying a fascist dictatorship.

If one of our NATO allies has become a dictatorship, then NATO needs to eject them.  Until then they are an ally, and people like you bitch and moan when Trump is hard on NATO paying their tab, can you imagine the psychosis if Trump badmouthed Erdogan?  You'd flip from the 'fascist"" screed to 'Trump is attacking our allies in a bi polar second.

&gt;Ivana literally said that Trump doesn't read books except one - he kept a book of Hitler quotes on his nightstand.

You mean someone said Ivana said this, because it's fake news and never happened.

&gt;Trump literally tweeted a quote by WW2 fascist Benito Mussolini.

Probably the one about punishing your political enemies with the power of the state as is happening to him currently.

&gt;et all this doesn't alarm you, and somehow your right wing indoctrination websites have drilled you into automatically responding either ""Fake news!"" Or even worse ""So what?"".

It doesn't alarm me because it's not true, all false narratives invented to attack Trump by the propaganda arm of the Dem party.

&gt;Your Tangerine Czar is selling out the US to cheap populism and fascism, and you don't care because he's your populist fascist.

What does this even mean?  That you don't want the US to be prosperous?  You don't want our economy to boom while others lag under job killing regulations?

Fascist are the ones silencing free speech.  Antifa.  Youtube.  Facebook.  It's happening all around you, people are chased from restaurants and have drinks thrown in their faces by the violent left who hopes to intimidate them into silence with the mob, like the mob that tried to break down Tucker's door while he was not home, but his frightened children were.  The ones who are willing to frighten little children in order to silence others are the fascists here.

&gt;How far from the original US values you have strayed...

The one who ignores racism in order to project fascism is most likely the fascist. In true Marx style, always accuse the other side of what you are doing while you are doing it.

&gt;I respect Republicans even though I might not agree with some of their views.

This is a blatant lie, perhaps you do, but Republicans get fired from jobs, chased from restarurnats, drinks thrown in their faces and more, and you support that, so I call bullshit, don't try to hide behind civility when the left has no civility, they are the violent ones trying to intimidate people into silence with mob tactics and other violence.

&gt;I do not respect Republicans that pretend Trump is a decent president just because he's ""their guy"".

Transition *vastly reduces* rates of suicide attempts, reducing it from about 40% down to the national average. When able to transition, with access to appropriate transition-related medical care, and when spared abuse and discrimination, trans people are as psychologically healthy as the general public.

Which, once again, is why transition-related medical care is recognized as medically necessary, frequently life saving medical treatment, by every major US and world medical authority.

All showed significant improvement in their psychological health, and they had notably lower rates of internalizing psychopathology than previously reported among trans children living as their natal sex. **Well-being was similar to or better than same-age young adults from the general population.**

&gt; 
&gt; Hi! 
&gt; 
&gt; It looks like you are talking about the book *Guns, Germs, and Steel* by *Jared Diamond*.
&gt; 
&gt; The book over the past years has become rather popular, which is hardly surprising since it is a good and entertaining read. It has reached the point that for some people it has sort of reached the status of gospel. On /r/history we noticed a trend where every time a question was asked that has even the slightest relation to the book a dozen or so people would jump in and recommending the book.  Which in the context of history is a bit problematic and the reason this reply has been written. 
&gt; 
&gt; Why it is problematic can be broken down into two reasons: 
&gt; 
&gt; 1. In academic history there isn't such thing as one definitive authority or work on things, there are often others who research the same subjects and people that dive into work of others to build on it or to see if it indeed holds up. This being critical of your sources and not relying on one source is actually a very important history skill often lacking when dozens of people just spam the same work over and over again as a definite guide and answer to ""everything"".  
&gt; 2. There are a good amount modern historians and anthropologists that are quite critical of *Guns, Germs, and Steel* and there are some very real issues with Diamond's work. These issues are often overlooked or not noticed by the people reading his book. Which is understandable given the fact that for many it will be their first exposure to the subject. Considering the popularity of the book it is also the reason that we felt it was needed to create this response. 
&gt; 
&gt; In an ideal world, every time the book was posted in /r/history, it would be accompanied by critical notes and other works covering the same subject. Lacking that a dozen other people would quickly respond and do the same. But simply put, that isn't always going to happen and as a result, we have created this response so people can be made aware of these things. Does this mean that the /r/history mods hate the book or Diamond himself? No, if that was the case we would simply instruct the bot to remove every mention of it, this is just an attempt to bring some balance to a conversation that in popular history had become a bit unbalanced.
&gt; It should also be noted that being critical of someone's work isn't that same as outright dismissing it. Historians are always critical of any work they examine, that is part of they core skill set and key in doing good research. 
&gt; 
&gt; Below you'll find a list of other works covering much of the same subject, further below you'll find an explanation of why many historians and anthropologists are critical of Diamonds work.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ## Criticism on *Guns, Germs, and Steel*
&gt; 
&gt; Many historians and anthropologists believe Diamond plays fast and loose with history by generalizing highly complex topics to provide an ecological/geographical determinist view of human history. There is a reason historians avoid grand theories of human history: those [""just so stories""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-so_story) don't adequately explain human history. It's true however that it is an entertaining introductory text that forces people to look at world history from a different vantage point. That being said, Diamond writes a rather oversimplified narrative that seemingly ignores the human element of history.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **Cherry-picked data while ignoring the complexity of issues**  
&gt; 
&gt; In his chapter ""Lethal Gift of Livestock"" on the origin of human crowd infections he picks 5 pathogens that best support his idea of domestic origins. However, when diving into the genetic and historic data, only two pathogens (maybe influenza and most likely measles) could possibly have jumped to humans through domestication. The majority were already a part of the human disease load before the origin of agriculture, domestication, and sedentary population centers. 
&gt; This is an example of Diamond ignoring the evidence that didn't support his theory to explain conquest via disease spread to immunologically naive Native Americas. 
&gt;   
&gt; A similar case of cherry-picking history is seen when discussing the conquest of the Inca.
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Pizarro's military advantages lay in the Spaniards' steel swords and other weapons, steel armor, guns, and horses... Such imbalances of equipment were decisive in innumerable other confrontations of Europeans with Native Americans and other peoples. The sole Native Americans able to resist European conquest for many centuries were those tribes that reduced the military disparity by acquiring and mastering both guns and horses.
&gt; 
&gt; This is a very broad generalization that effectively makes it false. Conquest was not a simple matter of conquering a people, raising a Spanish flag, and calling ""game over."" Conquest was a constant process of negotiation, accommodation, and rebellion played out through the ebbs and flows of power over the course of centuries. Some Yucatan Maya city-states maintained independence for two hundred years after contact, were ""conquered"", and then immediately rebelled again. 
&gt; The Pueblos along the Rio Grande revolted in 1680, dislodged the Spanish for a decade, and instigated unrest that threatened the survival of the entire northern edge of the empire for decades to come. 
&gt; Technological ""advantage"", in this case guns and steel, did not automatically equate to battlefield success in the face of resistance, rough terrain and vastly superior numbers. The story was far more nuanced, and conquest was never a cut and dry issue, which in the book is not really touched upon. In the book it seems to be case of the Inka being conquered when Pizarro says they were conquered.
&gt; 
&gt; **Uncritical examining of the historical record surrounding conquest**  
&gt; 
&gt; Being critical of the sources you come across and being aware of their context, biases and agendas is a core skill of any historian. 
&gt; 
&gt; Pizarro, Cortez and other conquistadores were biased authors who wrote for the sole purpose of supporting/justifying their claim on the territory, riches and peoples they subdued. To do so they elaborated their own sufferings, bravery, and outstanding deeds, while minimizing the work of native allies, pure dumb luck, and good timing. If you only read their accounts you walk away thinking a handful of adventurers conquered an empire thanks to guns and steel and a smattering of germs. No historian in the last half century would be so naive to argue this generalized view of conquest, but European technological supremacy is one keystone to Diamond's thesis so he presents conquest at the hands of a handful of adventurers.
&gt; 
&gt; **The construction of the arguments for GG&amp;S paints Native Americans specifically, and the colonized world in general, as categorically inferior**. 
&gt; 
&gt; To believe the narrative you need to view Native Americans as fundamentally naive, unable to understand Spanish motivations and desires, unable react to new weapons/military tactics, unwilling to accommodate to a changing political landscape, incapable of mounting resistance once conquered, too stupid to invent the key technological advances used against them, and doomed to die because they failed to build cities, domesticate animals and thereby acquire infectious organisms. When viewed through this lens, we hope you can see why so many historians and anthropologists are livid that a popular writer is perpetuating a false interpretation of history while minimizing the agency of entire continents full of people.

&amp;#x200B;

A little bit of info, not much but enough;

&amp;#x200B;

I have a brother. He lived in France for 10 years. Was married to a French girl. Loves French culture. Bi-lingual.

I have a sister. A Muslim convert. Married an Asian bloke (a copper). Sound bloke no issues.

&amp;#x200B;

My brother voted to leave the E.U. To keep the Muslims out! Says he hates Islam and Angela Merkel and all that. Yay for Tommy Robinson!!!

&amp;#x200B;

My sister also voted to leave the E.U. THOUGH THIS WAS TO KEEP THE WHITE CHRISTIANS EUROPEANS OUT! E.g. France Catholic Country. Spain Catholic Country. Poland Catholic Country. Italy (duh..) So both wanted the opposite of each other however voted for the same. My brother is just a bigot and besides Merkel is meant to be stepping down, I believe. However I have no-doubt that some Muslims would have felt threatened at the influx of devout Christians (there are some devout Polish Christians. Who also are very, very handy in a fight as well). These people are going to need Churches to pray in and the very same principle/budget that was making Mosques all of a sudden appear, well some Churches are instead and thus moving into the ghettos and turning what was a predominantly Asian area for want of a better word ""White"". But where as once upon a time you were walking down the street with a bunch of you mates and someone approached who had a different skin colour to yours and they would feel intimidated and  cross over the road. Well these guys are openly racist and are not scared. They ""have"" walked without a care in the world into a group and have been outnumbered 5-1 and gone looking for trouble.

&amp;#x200B;

The point I am making is that it makes a certain sense some Asians voting to leave the E.U.

&amp;#x200B;

Which leaves my bigot brother. I know he is not the only White, Christian Man to vote to leave the E.U. I personally think they blatantly lied to him and they fed on his prejudices.

&amp;#x200B;

So that leaves the reason Why? Well if you can get a diametric opposite people to vote on the same issue then you have done something very skilful. And it is for this reason that I think there has been some fucking dodgy goings on somewhere. Well its the media. It always is.

&amp;#x200B;

I think you have been played. I maybe right. I maybe wrong. C'est La Vie!

&amp;#x200B;

Please don't be offended at that remark. I said this to my brother at the time and I still stick by it. I realise that having studied the E.U. you obviously know more about the stupid stuff that has happened , but I think that to change something, then surely it is better to be a part of it (as in Veto rights) than to leave and the try and alter it.

My main concern is we leave then a lot of elderly people who voted leave (we won the war, up the empire woohoo) die. As a result a lot of the youth who were too young to vote at that time look at what we had (access to Europe for work or pleasure, just turn up with your passport and boom. You are good to go) and look at what they will get (applying for Visas) and are going to want to go back!

&amp;#x200B;

There will be a condition for re-entry and that will be

&amp;#x200B;

1. Loose the pound (yay for the Euro)
2. Entry to the  Schengen Area
3. Obviously no Veto.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So...basically think that this has been setup for a reason.

Why? To asset strip what we have.

How? To remove the E.U. and its laws which protect it.

&amp;#x200B;

Ask yourself this. 

&amp;#x200B;

1) Would the E.U. go out of its way to actively harm one of it's member states and in doing so harm itself.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Would the E.U. have a frame work in place which in fact protects its workers/citizens of this, of exploitation/harm

&amp;#x200B;

If we removed this protection over us and then placed this power over us in the hands of someone who is corrupt, who would sell his soul to the devil or already has then what?....

&amp;#x200B;

 

I don't trust Johnson, Reece-Mogg or  Farage. They only have their own interest at heart.

It encompasses Earth, Mars, and Venus in a near-future hard sci-fi setting. It was formed after an era of wars and fascist dictatorships, and so, many of the borders of the dictatorship era remain, such as the British Commonwealth owning Normandy and much of the Atlantic Islands. The People's Commonwealth is the only Socialist nation in the solar system, with all others being capitalist oligarchies, fascist dictatorships, or extremest cults. The flag can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leftistvexillology/comments/bufmsr/i_made_a_loweffort_flag_for_a_socialist_country/).

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the period of fascist dictatorships, and the beginning of the current revolutionary period, the British Union of Fascists underwent a revolution. This revolution was the first successful one in current times, completely overthrowing the fascist government and monarchy, replacing them with a developing Socialist government and planned economy. Immediately following the revolution, Normandy and the Atlantic Islands were offered independence as their own socialist nations but they declined.

&amp;#x200B;

Ireland was next to be invaded and liberated by the British, after a period of rapid economic growth in the British Commonwealth. Ireland easily fell, and was made into its own independent Socialist Republic, which after about a year voted to join the British Commonwealth directly. Several years and millions of lives were spent dismantling the Fascist power structure, almost all of which was aided or directly caused by British intervention. One of the few examples is the Soviet Union, which rose during a time of trial for the British. The British found their way into a war with The 3rd French Empire, Fourth Reich, New Roman Empire, and Polish-Lithuanian State. The Soviet Union joined the war on the side of the British, and pushed through the relatively undefended east, allowing Britain to push from the west against lighter resistance.

&amp;#x200B;

The British and Soviets eventually formed a union with the rest of Liberated Europe, which continued on to be the People's Commonwealth of today. Due to the British position of honour as the first Socialist nation of this new era, and was made the leading province of the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth capital was placed in London.

To say this is the government's problem is ridiculous.  They can't force people to not run out and buy the latest iPhone or the latest car.  They would rather spend it then save it.  Working at McD's or Wal-Mart is not meant to be a career unless you are working towards a management position. It is meant to be a job while working through school or while looking for a better job.  And they are out there, they just need to leave their city or state to find it.  Oil rig work pays great money and they are begging for people, but they are not going to find those jobs in the middle of NY or LA.  Put down the controller and get up off the couch, hell that's half the battle.  Source: Really CNBC, that's what you consider unbiased?

On #3 While on the subject of money.  Yes, there is a wealth gap.  America is not about equality in where you end up, its about equality where you start.  Why are hundreds of thousands still trying to come here every year?  Because they know if they work hard and follow the rules they can get ahead. People do it every day.  Those that have been on welfare for years and even generations see no need to get a job when the government will pay them to do nothing but pump out another kid. And now the leftist want to give them even more with UBS? That is more reliance on the government than on themselves some have called this a form of slavery.  Bill Gates built Microsoft and he made a lot of people (including employees) rich, so we should take his money because he has helped the world? So we should punish those that have vision, ideas and work ethic? They pay the majority of taxes as it stands now.  I know what you are saying, they have loopholes.  Fine abolish the IRS and everyone pays a flat tax of 10%.  That will remove the loopholes. 

For #2 Medical costs, right it's expensive.  You know why because the US is at the forefront of medical innovation.  We are paying the research costs so the rest of the world can have it cheap.  Where are the people dying in the streets because they were turned away? 

And #4 Homelessness, you obviously forgot about that.  NY actually had a good plan for this.  The cops would round up the homeless and get them into mental health facilities or whatever services they needed, thanks, Rudy.  But from what I have heard the homelessness problem in NY is coming back thanks to Bill D. But LA has gone old school they brought back Typhus.  I guess Eric has his own way of dealing with the problem.  Mental health is a problem in our country and we are working towards solutions.  But we still have a ways to go.

Traditional stereotypes of men as socially dominant, along with related traits such as misogyny and homophobia, can be considered ""toxic"" due in part to their promotion of violence, including sexual assault and domestic violence. The socialization of boys often normalizes violence, such as in the saying ""boys will be boys"" with regard to bullying and aggression.

Self-reliance and emotional repression are correlated with increased psychological problems in men such as depression, increased stress, and substance abuse.

Yeah, they're just ignorant. Most people are. No one who is serious can say that humans should simply eat what's found on the ground, because we would be extinct as a species if we relied on that. Not to say that's necessarily a bad thing, but it isn't really the goal of serious people. We are a sub-species of chimpanzee, but we lack several crucial survival traits the other two species have. If not for our brains, we'd have enjoyed maybe a few hundred thousand years and then gone flat extinct.

&gt;a ""h-g"" society

Which again, is an erroneous concept. No animals are hunter-gatherers, certainly not humans. For most of our history we ate what we found, where we found it, like any other animal, but we're poorly adapted to that, and wouldn't last more than a few hundred thousand years doing it.

&gt;It was the average estimated human population prior to wide spread agriculture.

Oh... yeah I've seen some like that too. Those estimates are also culturally biased, based on 19th century European anthropology. The actual numbers are closer to ~200 million, circa 15-10kya (just prior to agricultural rise in the mid-east/Eurasian steppe). Many of those were in the ""western"" hemisphere, and Africa, and so were dismissed as being non-human. They also discounted the 5 other species of human prior to 100kya.

&gt;population would be allowed to have children

Uh, no? Who said anything about allowing or disallowing anything? Remember we're talking about an anarchist world.

I never understand how this is where people's minds immediately go. Like, you can't think of anything else.

Oh, no that'd go away rather quickly. A decade probably, depending on how quickly people adopt the better ways. The quicker they do, the quicker world hunger is solved, and birthrates start dropping.

Because she hasn‚Äôt been able to come up with her portion. Because she‚Äôs changing herself to look like Daenrys, despite it being all fake.

This has been going on for three months. We‚Äôre both super super busy students, not much time to hang out. All she does is talk about GOT. Not the quality of (past) writing etc. just Emilia Clarke, sightings, and sometimes other cast members.

Cool. Some people have favourite celebrities.

Except I can barely talk to her. We used to snuggle in bed and talk for ~20 mins before sleeping. We‚Äôre both busy and tired students so it means a lot. Now every night she just wants to be on her phone, looking at GOT/freefolk (?) subreddits, and what the cast is doing, mainly emilia.

When I try talking about other things, it‚Äôs short answers. I have to struggle to keep the conversation going. When I try to talk about the show quality itself, it almost always reverts back to Emilia. She gets frustrated that I don‚Äôt care much about her

Please. It‚Äôs a great show because of all the writers, the costume people, the directors and producers. There were many choices for actors. They‚Äôre not special to me.

These days, HALF the things out of her mouth is about GOT. If I talk about a fancy place in Europe I‚Äôd like to visit one day, I‚Äôd get a ‚ÄúOMG. You think GOT was ever filmed there? Wait, I think I saw a pic of Emilia there‚Äù

*pulls out her phone and then ignores me for ten minutes during dinner\*

When she spent an ENTIRE evening after school talking about Emilia‚Äôs charity reddit post, I mentioned that other people have charities too. I even volunteered for one today. Wanna hear about it? Nope.

It‚Äôs even worse.

She has killed off HALF of her hair going full blonde to look like her. Bleaching costs a lot, apparently.

I had to cover her portion of rent one month with what little money I had so we wouldn't be evicted.

Then she got microblading done to make her eyebrows like Emilia‚Äôs. Guess who was short again, and guess who had to spot her? Yeup. She promised to pay me back‚Ä¶ but with tuition and the drinking, no money.

The part that hurts me the most? She keeps insisting that I‚Äôd prefer her that way. Christ, I want my GF. Not some random actress.

I don‚Äôt get where she got the idea that I would ever want her to look like Emilia. Do I find Emilia Clarke attractive? Sure. But not jaw dropping. Nothing special. I go to college, I see pretty girls all the time. Take the ones with a baby face, give them a blonde wig, a ton of makeup expertly applied to look natural (apparently my sisters best friend worked on set!), film filters and boom. Another mad princess.

I‚Äôve tried teling my GF multiple times that

1. I honestly wouldn‚Äôt find her more attractive if she looked like Daenarys/Emilia,

2. that she doesn‚Äôt look like anything in the show. It‚Äôs all makeup lighting etc. Hair is fake.

But she keeps insisting I‚Äôll be happier to ‚Äúdate a prettier girl‚Äù and that she‚Äôll be happier too

Fine. I‚Äôm not controlling. You want to drastically change your looks? Sure.

BUT. DON‚ÄôT INSIST. I .WANT. IT. THAT. WAY.

AND. DON‚ÄôT. LET. IT. CAUSE. OUR. EVICTION.

I‚Äôm tired. Last week she needed me to pay for her portion for the third month in a row. Said she needed $$ for textbooks. I then learned from friend soon after that she spent $450 on super long blonde extensions because all the bleach she used to go blonde killed her hair.

I don‚Äôt know if I can pay of both of our rent in another month if she keeps it up.

When I try talking to her about it, its always ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my body, my choice‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhy are you mad, I‚Äôll be hotter‚Äù. ‚Äú I have told her about wanting to leave if this continues. She isn‚Äôt taking it seriously it seems.

I‚Äôve checked to see if something happened, like a recent accident that has caused her brain to act all weird. Maybe undiagnosed mental issues. Then I‚Äôd be understanding. As far as I know, none. She hasn‚Äôt said anything

Yes, they bought the most effective weaponry they could.


The Arab Slave Trade is awful. Africans enslaving eachother is a fact. However, there was a level of innovation in the transatlantic slavery, that of associating it exclusively blackness. In Africa, slaves were not a racial caste, nor enslaved for multiple generations, nor used solely for unskilled labor.


**No.** The English and Spanish deliberately spread disease throughout the Indigenous populations of the Americas. It was less ""Oops, I caught the toast on fire, let me put it out"" and more ""The toast caught on fire, so I threw gasoline on it and stepped outside, consuming the entirety of my neighborhood in a blazing inferno."" Encomiendas wreaked demographic havoc on the peoples under the Spanish Empire.


There is no quotation mark needed with colonizing. Denying that the Americas experienced a genocide is akin to Holocaust denial. Denying that colonialism is an unabashedly BAD thing is just stupidity.


The entire point of all your arguments so far have been apologetics, defense of an unjust society. Defense of societal wrongs. Your arguments are all justifications for the ills of white society. Not once have you painted a less than sympathetic picture of European-Americans, which is what you'd be trying to do if your point that ""no group is completely innocent or guilty."" Instead, you double down and take offense everytime the effects of historical subjugation is mentioned. If you feel conviction, it's not because I imposed it on you, it's because deep down, you know that it's unjust. Race, chattel-based slavery is unjust. Jesus, it pains me to even have to say it to a fully-formed adult, but genocide is also unjust.


And I think that's the thing I find most egregious. There are very clear issues in our society stemming from Colonialism. Just because there's no more slavery, no more Spanish racial hierarchies, no more Jim Crow, doesn't mean that there are no more issues.


Cause. Effect.


You're a fan of western culture. Just as there were abundant socioeconomic effects which lead to the European subjugation of the world, there are abundant socioeconomic factors which lead to the status of blacks and natives as a permanent underclass of the Americas.


The plurarality of my genes are white. If you think I hate white people, you're wrong. If you think I hate white people for the sole basis of being white, you're wrong. It's subjugation I hate. It's denialism I abhor. All I've been saying is that Colonialism's legacy is NOT dead, and that we need to understand it and move fowards if we want to tackle the issues underpinning our society. There is no middle ground. There is no argument to the contrary with anything but an undercurrent of thinly-veiled white supremacy. Just as you accuse me of hating white people, it's clear you love them. I'm sure you take pride in ""colonization"". I'm sure you think it ""wasn't that bad"".


When the Romans were slain at Gaul at the hands of Vercingetorix, I'm sure the average legionnaire was confused why the Gauls had such antipathy of them. They were a ""cultured people, bringing civilization to a barbarian land."" I'm sure they thought something along the lines of: ""We have brought them only good, we have brought them innovation and culture, they have no reason to hate us."" Their first thought wasn't of the culling of 1/3 their population. Their first thought wasn't of the destruction of an urbanized, advanced society. Their first thought wasn't of the death of their native languages and cultures. But the Gauls? They knew what they were fighting for. They knew that they were never going to be at the forefront of their nation's leadership again. They knew they would never be the dominant peoples ever again. Win or lose, that'd be their fate.


From a Gaul, to a Roman; a ""Barbarian"" to a ""Civilized Man""; a Uto-Aztecan to an Indo-European: I don't hate you, I hate what you've done. I hate that you dehumanized Natives and Blacks. I hate that you're still complicit in justifiying the unjustifiable. I hate that you still hold prejudice against our people and our culture. I hate that it pains you to recognize it.

Here's a study of 1,221,727 men in Sweden, including focuses on siblings and twins: ""Cardiovascular fitness, as measured by ergometer cycling, positively associated with intelligence"" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2785721/ (the study even has great charts showing a clear linear relationship). It's hard to get better studies than that one.

&gt;more attractive

I suggest going to a webcam site and seeing which of the performers have the greatest number of viewers/payers; as that's a good impromptu way to measure it. I'd be willing to bet the most popular ones are not fat.  I can dig up studies, but the academic nature of it tends to make it so dry that it is meaningless.

&gt; Back in the Middle Ages

The ""fat = rich"" at that time is extremely overstated, it's a myth that the obese like to perpetuate - the ""plump"" that was liked was within the normal weight range, to the mildy overweight range (which many people consider thin-to-normal today). First, few people (if anyone) in that era would be considered ""fat"" by the modern US or western European standard; it would be rare to find anyone who was obese. Second, it **was** stigmatized: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9877248. They didn't like gluttony.

&gt; live longer

Normal-weight people have a healthy lifespan 7 years longer than class 2 obese people, on average: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5418561/ (first paragraph of the results). Do note that studies are tending towards measuring ""healthy lifespan"" rather than just ""lifespan"", as a person can be kept on life support for a very long time. Class 2 obese is medically ""very obese"" but it's what most people colloquially will begin to call ""obese"" - because overweight and obese people are so common that people are desensitized to it. Class 3 obese (medically ""extremely obese"" or ""morbidly obese"", colloquially referred to as ""oh god that's fat"") results in 14 years of lost life - https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-study-finds-extreme-obesity-may-shorten-life-expectancy-14-years. There are a few nuances to the studies: the prevalence of obesity has increased so much in the past 2 decades that there is a significant difference between someone who was a normal weight at age 40 but is now obese at age 60, compared to someone who is currently obese at age 20 (which was extremely rare a few decades ago) - lifelong obesity means far less exercise during young and middle-age periods, and far more damage to joint and connective tissue *before* the person can even become elderly. In other words, the studies on health today underestimate the impact that lifelong obesity has. Second, the recent drug epidemic pollutes the data as meth reduces the appetite, so addicts tend to lose weight as their addiction progresses towards their early death. I do not believe any studies exclude these deaths from their statistics - so that pollutes the data of population-wide surveys, but not the studies of deaths from natural causes.

Watch any movie made in the 60's, 70's, or 80's and see just how few fat people there are - not just the main characters, but the extras in the background too.

Nada de errado nisso, boa sorte para os caras.

 A hist√≥ria dos tucanos √© um caso interessant√≠ssimo para a ci√™ncia pol√≠tica: foi um caso claro em que a posi√ß√£o do partido dentro da disputa nacional determinou mais seu desenvolvimento do que a ideologia inicial de seus fundadores.

  

 O ""social democracia"" no nome do partido era de verdade. A maior parte dos fundadores do PSDB vinha da centro esquerda, da melhor centro esquerda: FHC, Covas, Serra, Bresser, Montoro. 

 Gente fundamental na briga por introduzir a pauta dos direitos sociais na Constitui√ß√£o de 1988. Na verdade, a atua√ß√£o incontestavelmente de esquerda do PSDB aconteceu a√≠, antes de sua funda√ß√£o.

 Mas PSDB nunca foi um nome que nomeasse muito bem a coisa. Os partidos sociais-democratas europeus sempre foram estruturados em torno dos sindicatos. Quando o PSDB escolheu seu nome, Franco Montoro advertiu: se o PT moderar o discurso, os sociais-democratas ser√£o eles.

 Talvez por essa inconsist√™ncia o PSDB tenha sido o √∫nico grande partido conhecido mais por sua mascote (o tucano) do que por sua sigla.

 Mas a tens√£o ideol√≥gica dentro do partido n√£o se deve apenas √† origem de seus fundadores na oposi√ß√£o √† ditadura militar.

 O PSDB s√≥ virou protagonista nacional quando FHC lan√ßou o Plano Real (n√£o, n√£o foi o Itamar, parem com isso). E o Plano Real foi um neg√≥cio politicamente muito singular.

 No come√ßo dos anos 1990, excepcionalmente, o que era priorit√°rio para a administra√ß√£o macroecon√¥mica tamb√©m era priorit√°rio para o combate √†s desigualdades: derrotar a hiperinfla√ß√£o.

 Foi nessa conflu√™ncia que a singular coaliz√£o de pol√≠ticos sociais-democratas e economistas ortodoxos gerou o PSDB moderno.

 N√£o h√° a menor garantia de que essa circunst√¢ncia v√° se repetir sempre. √â muito comum, e talvez seja a regra, que medidas necess√°rias √† estabilidade econ√¥mica gerem mais desigualdade. Por isso, ali√°s, pol√≠ticas redistributivas s√£o necess√°rias.

 Eventualmente, a disputa com o PT fez do PSDB o ponto de converg√™ncia da direita brasileira. Quem entrou no PSDB a partir do meio dos anos 90 j√° entrou querendo brigar com a esquerda. As pautas levantadas pelos tucanos, a maneira como votaram no Congresso a partir da√≠, refletiram essa virada.

 Foi um longo processo, mas o div√≥rcio entre o PSDB e suas origens na esquerda foi assinado na √∫ltima sexta-feira. O [PSDB de Doria √© um partido claramente de direita](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/05/quem-nao-concordar-com-o-novo-psdb-que-peca-para-sair-diz-doria.shtml), que est√°, sim, como Gengis Khan, mais ao centro do que Bolsonaro.

 N√£o sei se vai dar certo. Se Bolsonaro for um sucesso, por que algu√©m votaria em Doria? E se n√£o for, o discurso de direita ainda vai soar t√£o atraente? Na centro direita, Doria enfrentar√° a concorr√™ncia do DEM e do partido que deve se formar em torno da candidatura de Luciano Huck.

 Agora a bandeira social-democrata est√° esperando que algu√©m no Brasil a pegue do ch√£o. Se ao menos houvesse no Brasil um partido com base sindical s√≥lida, experi√™ncia com pol√≠ticas de redistribui√ß√£o de renda e que estivesse precisando reciclar seu discurso, talvez fosse poss√≠vel fazer alguma coisa a esse respeito.",True,False,False,,0,1559545343,,False,0,{},epvqkbs,True,t3_bw7rdi,False,True,t3_bw7rdi,/r/brasilnoticias/comments/bw7rdi/celso_rocha_de_barros_o_p√≥spsdb/epvqkbs/,False,,1568798602,1,True,[],False,brasilnoticias,t5_3a1qf,r/brasilnoticias,restricted,0,

I advise against the RM if your main intention is to read and annotate papers. The reasons are the following:
- page turn is annoyingly slow (OK, it's acceptable, but other devices can do way better)
- links are not clickable : its REALLY painful to look up references/citations ( I find this insane) 
- the only way to annotate is to write on the margin/between the lines: you zoom in, write, zoom out. It's an annoyingly slow process. 
- the highliter is like on paper with every advantages / disadvantages of it (I only see disadvantages : it's hard to do straight lines and cannot add annotations to the highlighted text) 
- for longer stuff the table of contents is a joke: it displays everything on the top level (say you want to read a book, then you don't only see the chapters but also each paragraph present in the TOC, and without indentation or visual aid to tell them apart from the chapters) , which makes it effectively useless. 

On the other hand, if you just want to use it for taking notes / jotting while thinking, it's really a nice device, and I can absolutely recommend it. In fact I use it every day and am very happy with it. 

Note that for pdfs you probably are better off with an A4 device. The Onyx devices seem to write equally well as the RM ( I tried one for a few seconds and felt great) but they are quite bulky and heavy. The Sony Dpt Rp1 seems usable after the recent firmware update too. (Actually I own the DPT S1, it's really nice for reading papers especially that it almost fully knows the pdf format: highlights, annotations, TOC, links etc. However, you don't want to write more than a few words on that device. The Rp1 now looks to be similarly good - not sure about the writing experience - except if you're in Europe or using Linux).

However I am mostly critical of its limits, not its current practice. See we have not even got to its limits because all the while such a system does give us tools to punish bad actors within we hardly use them. By that of course I mean having the capacity to depose a perceived bad actor (I.e. one that goes directly against our perceived values and most of all the reasons that we got him/her elected). Being deposed, basically fired from a position certainly cannot and should not act towards the betterment of your CV. Connections or not

Secondly, especially in the US I cannot be convinced that there are absolutely no voices that more closely mirror the will of the people. It is the country with one of the least ideological/political polyphony . Take any random European country, or indeed from most places in the world and you'd get your garden variety nationalists, to near-communists all under the same roof and not only that, they'd actually vote against laws that go against their perceived values. The homogeneity you speak of, is again the will of the people not wanting to vote for alternatives.

Now again, I am not saying that actually exercising representative democracy to its fullest will solve all problems, or even most, but it is far better than the oligarchy that you seemingly describe in your (long) post.

Getting a guy like ""Dread Pirate Roberts"" in jail could actually cost you your political career in other countries (for voting such dimwitted laws). Heck I know of similar situations in fact in at least two separate states. In the US the system on one hand seems more stable (which is practical) but also less representative of the will of the people, at least given the way that the people choose to exercise their right in choosing their representatives.

Try to do that stuff in Switzerland or even Sweden and see your whole career going down the drain.

Some crazy chicks which put frozen chicken in their vags? Like, do you really think that such ""protesters"" were even reported to Putin?

&gt;Do the people of Russia know all of the things their gov has been doing 

Since Russia doesn't have anything like ""great Chineese firewall"", which isn't perfect by itself, we can freely read everything with the help of google translate, plus there are tons of propagandist channels which aren't based in Russia, so don't even bother to match Russian laws, like medusa, based in Lithuania, I think. People do get everything - Russian, view, Western view, and figure the truth inbetween.

&gt;US elections, 

Step aside - how important is US president? US had as president Bush Jr. Twice. He didn't matter. ""Yes, we can"" couldn't close a single prison in Guantanomo. He didn't matter. PotUS isn't the person which makes decisions in US. Meddling with elections for Russian President is like breaking into the parked car to change the voice of GPS navigator between male and female. Huge risks, no benefits. It's stupid. Putin doesn't do stupid things.

&gt;Ukraine

Nato exists because Russia can take half of the Europe in hours. In your narrative reality Russia invades Ukraine, poorest european country, for 5 years and can't mow it down, while to start succesfully decreasing the size of ISIS in Syria took like 200 people. Remember how Russian ""invasion"" during war of 080808 was misreported?

""poisonings""... What poisons Ru-UK relationships right now? Britain openly brags about not extorting about more than 2 thousands of dollar billionairs of Russian origin. How much money Berezovsky stole? A man behind Yeltsin, which bankrupted a country with trillion dollar budget. We are talking about trillions of dollars stolen from Russia residing under UK control. And to not give those money to Russia back British government needs to kill random brit every couple years and say ""Russia did it"". Because it's statistically improbable that said random brit would make 1/1000 of this sum in his lifetime, any successful politician would make decision in a heartbeat. When you think ""Russian"" what comes to mind? Simple, brutal, effective solutions. T34, AK. When Russians want someone dead, we blow up the guy. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelimkhan_Yandarbiyev Poison? You may die delivering it, victim may or may not get the lethal dose, victim may or may not talk, unusual poison leaves traces you can track... It's like the opposite of what Russian would have done, poison is subtle, elegant, I'd say. **aristocratic** way of killing. Add on top previous ""litvinenko poisoning"", which was as successful as ""Salisbury"", can you imagine decision tree in GRU? ""Guys, case with Litvinenko was a disaster, let's try poison again""? Or it was in fact great success, but for someone else? Spy himself was living in Britain for 20 years, he was empty, killing empty guy to expose spy network which could be used to kill actual full defector is stupid.

As far as I am aware Assad fights against such sick fucks that US couldn't find passable representative for those forces in years, they don't have any political program other than ""sharia law"", which would be as inhumane as possible with stripping women of rights, beheading gays, and whatever.

Investigation, which starts with ""guys, we don't know Russian language, but we googled russian dashcam videos and assembled very good proof that Russia did it"".

There are millions upon millions of hours of russian dashcam videos. And they somehow managed to find specific videos with specific car on it. And did it multiple times?

You should know that Panini's Grammar did rely on context in many cases.

Sanskrit has a long written and oral tradition. Panini‚Äôs codification of Sanskrit has conferred scholars unprecedented knowledge of its inner workings. His works illustrate meticulously how an unlimited number of things can be expressed in Sanskrit. However, the claim that a natural language, however well documented its grammar may be, is more fit for use that another in AI sounds highly suspect. A meticulously defined grammar does not absolve Sanskrit from any potential ambiguities that can arise in expression. Ask people who read Sanskrit prose to tell you about the challenge that it can be to tease out the meaning in those beautiful and rich verses. Furthermore, a fundamental nature of every natural language is its ability to express virtually every thought possible.

Sanskrit is not a language completely devoid of inconsistencies, and such irregularities betray its history of evolution from Indoeuropean.

&gt; Nazareth is a Scottish hard rock band, founded in Dunfermline, Scotland, in 1968, that had several hits in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s, and established an international audience with their 1975 album Hair of the Dog. Perhaps their best-known hit single was a cover of the Felice and Boudleaux Bryant penned ballad, ""Love Hurts, in 1975. The band continues to record and tour.

&gt; Nazareth was formed out of the ashes of the semi-professional Dunfermline group The Shadettes formed in 1961 by vocalist Dan McCafferty, guitarist Manny Charlton (ex Mark V and The Red Hawks), bassist Pete Agnew, and drummer Darrell Sweet. They took their name from the first line of The Band's classic song ""The Weight"" (""I pulled into Nazareth / Was feelin' about half past dead..."")

&gt; The band moved to London, England in 1970, and released their self-titled debut album in 1971. After getting some attention with their second album Exercises, released in 1972, Nazareth supported Deep Purple on tour, and issued the Roger Glover produced, Razamanaz, in early 1973. This collection spawned two UK Top Ten hits, ""Broken Down Angel"" and ""Bad Bad Boy"". This was followed by Loud 'N' Proud in late 1973, which contained another hit single with a hard-rocking cover of Joni Mitchell's song ""This Flight Tonight"". Then came another album Rampant, in 1974, that was equally successful although its only single, ""Shanghai'ed in Shanghai"", narrowly missed the British Top 40. A non-album song, again a cover version, this time of Tomorrow's ""My White Bicycle"", was a UK Top 20 entry in 1975.

&gt; Hair of the Dog was released in April 1975. The title track of that album (popularly, though incorrectly, known as ""Son Of A Bitch"" due to its chorus lyrics) became a staple of 1970s rock radio. The American version of the album included a song originally recorded by The Everly Brothers, and also covered by Roy Orbison, the melodic ballad ""Love Hurts"", that was released as a hit single in the UK and in the U.S., where it went platinum. The track became the band's only U.S. Top Ten hit. The song spent a record-shattering 60 weeks on the Norwegian chart.

&gt; In 1979, second guitarist Zal Cleminson was added to the line-up, remaining for two albums, No Mean City and Malice in Wonderland, and contributing numerous compositions. Malice in Wonderland produced a popular AOR single called ""Holiday"". In 1981, they contributed the song ""Crazy (A Suitable Case for Treatment)"" to the soundtrack to the film, Heavy Metal.

&gt; Various Nazareth line-ups continued to make studio albums and tour throughout the 1980s and 1990s, although their popularity had declined such that some albums no longer received either a UK or a U.S. release. They remained popular in Europe, particularly Germany, where ""Dream On"" became a hit single. Billy Rankin returned for a second spell in the ranks in 1991 for the No Jive album, replacing Manny Charlton who pursued a solo career.

&gt; An unlikely tribute came in 1993 when Guns N' Roses covered Nazareth's ""Hair of the Dog"" on ""The Spaghetti Incident?"", consolation after they turned down Axl Rose's request for the group to play at his wedding. Rankin departed again in 1994, but with Jimmy Murrison and keyboard player Ronnie Leahy, Nazareth maintained a live following in Europe and the U.S.

&gt; In 1999, while touring the U.S., original drummer Darrell Sweet died at age 51 of a heart attack. He was replaced by bassist Pete Agnew's son Lee for later editions of the band.

&gt; In February 2008, an album was released on the Hamburg based label Edel Entertainment entitled The Newz. The release of the album coincided with Nazareth's fortieth anniversary tour which started on 25 January in Sweden and visited most of Europe, finishing on 4 November 2008 in Norway.

I am sorry, but you're actually the one absolutely oversimplifying things. The world is a network of overlapping fields interacting with each other. Nothing is encapsulated and free of influence.

It is ""their fault"" is way too much simplified. Syria is much result of the US intervention under Bush Jr. that brought on ISIS. In Syria Russians and Americans are currently active, either propping up or trying to topple Assad.

The influx of weapons and fighters from the West and Russia in exchange for ressources is what keeps most conflicts fuelled right now. In the past, these conflicts would burn out. This isn't happening anymore.

The people might have chosen a different path had the influences been different. China might be more democratic if we hadn't sold China the means to suppress any dissent in the internet.

I think there was an interview with Foucault where he said that over 10% of the sentences in a post-structuralist text are nonsense because the French academic audience wouldn't consider you profound if they could understand you clearly

Classifying the (today, admittedly often impenetrable) style of D&amp;G as 'academic' is a misunderstanding of the cultural and historical context they were written in. The D&amp;G books weren't aimed at academics but at the massive protest &amp; student movement of the time. The quip about a 15 year old being in the best position to understand the book wasn't a joke. In Europe - and especially France - during the 70s, in aftermath of '68, theory wasn't just something for academics and weirdos but was a genuine youth culture with main stream appeal. In fact, the books were so popular that they became massive *national bestsellers* in France (I think they all peaked at #1). Of course, today this is unimaginable but that is precisely why they feel so foreign, we live in an entirely different cultural &amp; intellectual landscape.

Also, I'm fairly certain that that Foucault quip (if it actually happened, which is dubious, since it's only been verified by Chomsky and Searle, who obviously have an axe to grind with French theory) was aimed at Derrida (who Foucault hated) and not Deleuze (who Foucault was friends with).",True,False,False,,0,1559555257,,1559556003,0,{},epvwhrr,False,t3_bturd6,False,True,t1_ep30h91,/r/CriticalTheory/comments/bturd6/starting_with_deleuze_and_guttari_do_i_start_with/epvwhrr/,False,,1568801376,3,True,[],False,CriticalTheory,t5_2tmcb,r/CriticalTheory,public,0,

Oh this Stephen J. Gould who's claims have ***actually*** been debunked in his ideologically driven book T*he Mismeasure of Man:*

''Scientists have often been accused of letting their ideology influence their results, and one of the most famous cases is that of Morton‚Äôs skulls ‚Äî the global collection amassed by the 19th-century physical anthropologist Samuel George Morton.

In a 1981 book, ‚ÄúThe Mismeasure of Man,‚Äù the paleontologist [Stephen Jay Gould](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/stephen_jay_gould/index.html?inline=nyt-per) asserted that Morton, believing that brain size was a measure of intelligence, had subconsciously manipulated the brain volumes of European, Asian and African skulls to favor his bias that Europeans had larger brains and Africans smaller ones.

But now physical anthropologists at the [University of Pennsylvania](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/university_of_pennsylvania/index.html?inline=nyt-org), which owns Morton‚Äôs collection, have remeasured the skulls, and in an article that does little to burnish Dr. Gould‚Äôs reputation as a scholar, they conclude that almost every detail of his analysis is wrong.

‚ÄúOur results resolve this historical controversy, demonstrating that Morton did not manipulate his data to support his preconceptions, contra Gould,‚Äù they write in the current [PLoS Biology](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001071).''",True,False,False,,0,1559555355,,False,0,{},epvwjuu,False,t3_btljhu,False,True,t1_epu04ra,/r/JordanPeterson/comments/btljhu/dont_be_a_victim/epvwjuu/,False,,1568801403,1,True,[],False,JordanPeterson,t5_32jqy,r/JordanPeterson,public,0,

**Introduction**

Hellion is a guild for people that want to be able to mix serious raiding with real life obligations. It's a guild for those of us that want to clear all content at a steady pace, but in a sensible and time efficient way. 
We are now looking for more players of high standard that know their class and play it well, prepares for raids in terms of consumables, pre raid bis gear, enchants and strategy. The goal is to form a tight roster of highly skilled and like minded players.
It's a big plus if you have experience from raiding in vanilla, but it's not a requirement.

**What we expect from you**

= You can level to 60 somewhat fast and commit to a maximum of 3 raids a week, 3 hours per raid. Most likely Wed/Sun/Tue 20:00-23:00. 

= You know your class and play it well.

= You can think and act in stressfull situations. 

= You show up prepared to every raid. Strategy, consumables, pre raid bis gear and enchants.

= Willingness to build a positive reputation for the guild. You represent all of us when you wear the &lt;Hellion&gt; name. Act accordingly.

Obviously you would take every step possible to avoid as much interest as possible - saving/borrowing from friends and family to increase your deposit etc.

Personally I‚Äôm more comfortable finding a mortgage with the best rates etc rather than going the route of ‚ÄòIslamic‚Äô Mortgages where you end up paying more than you would in interest, just calling it by another name. 

&gt; Buying a house through banks

&gt;Question: What is the ruling on buying a house using a standard mortgage loan through a bank for those living here in the West?

&gt;Answer: We do not see a problem in buying a house via banks, because owning a house is considered a general need (hajah) that is to be treated as a necessity (darurah). As for renting a house, then this does not really fulfil the needs without causing hardship. This is because the one renting does not feel a sense of security and stability while he is renting. Add to this the excessive amount of money that is spent on renting which is more than what he would pay for buying a house that he can own. He then ends up paying such amounts while not having ownership of a single part of the house. Over lengthy periods of time, this becomes similar to wasting money in return for a benefit that does not last. As well as this, there always remains a risk of their contract being terminated at any time, which is especially harmful if he has many children; and if he is elderly or has a low income, then he could be at risk of being left without a home in this case. These are some of the harms, along with others, that one may suffer from due to renting.

&gt;On the other hand, buying a house protects one from the aforementioned risks, and brings about many benefits. From those benefits are that one is able to choose a location that is safe for him and his family, and that allows him to benefit himself and his family in ways that would not be possible by merely renting, and there is no doubt that the Shari‚Äôah does not prevent people from things that are more beneficial than they are harmful. Based on this, we do not see a problem in buying a house, according to the method mentioned above, in order to live in. This is on the condition that it is the only available way of owning a house. A ruling had previously been given allowing this by the European Council for Fatwa and Research, number [81 (4/18)].",True,False,False,,0,1559556835,,False,0,{},epvxghu,False,t3_bw1ql7,False,False,t3_bw1ql7,/r/MuslimMarriage/comments/bw1ql7/new_muslim_couples_how_did_you_go_about_owning_a/epvxghu/,False,,1568801831,4,True,[],False,MuslimMarriage,t5_39x1d,r/MuslimMarriage,public,0,

And there are so many players who played even longer. Now what im talking about doesnt apply to new players ofc, but im a way none of this does since they arent in the late game. 

Yes i forgot u said it would be limited. But i dont know why for some reason i feel like that wouldnt be enough. Or it would be too much. I feel like it couldnt be properly balanced. I HATE and i cant stress this enough i fckimg HATE gear in e7. I swear to god i didnt drop more then 5 to 10 pieces of good gear for 3 months of playing. All my gear was ""free"" gear from world and events. I dont know if u played TERA but in that game basicly u can farm for a week and try to upgrade your weapon with a 5% chance to succed and fail it every god damm time. Same goes for e7. I belive that the system has way way way too many layers of RNG. I come back to Langrisser. In that game gear is done perfrctly. While we cant say there is no RNG, even players with bad luck can stay competative. I firmly belive that main stats and sub stats need to be separate. I belive that sub stats should be a ""rune"" system of a sort. So while this sounds like its the same as being able to reroll the substats couple of times, its really not. Its just frustrating with how many thinga can go wrong. So i belive the whole system in its core needs rebalancing. But hey if that isnt possible then even 5 rerolls are cool. Im sure many players would appreciate that.

And when it comes to the idle topic. Here is am example. I grind it out my altar for Kluri/Hazel/Lorina all in 1 day. I mean 1 day for each. Took me around 8 to 10 hours. What i did is have the phome sitting next to me, whilst i was ironing my clothes, doing the dishes, watching Supernatural with my gf etc. So no its not the same as idle game. Becase while i agree it would be easier if i could have just left the phone alone for 8 hours, it would make the experience all that much less fun. Seeing those 2 epic runes or 3 triangle runes srop and feeling that happines, and just as weel seeing 1 triangle and being so mad. And this just brings us back to my point. I can see how much people are ready to grind e7. They just need to change that grind. I mean doing the same level for 10 hours str8 in order to complete the most interesting part of the game ( at least for me, i loved SC ) kinda makes that expereince worse u know. Its better when things are time gated. So u have to plan for days and get excited and all that. Or at least have it be more then just runes. Reduce the cost of runes and swap it with anything idc what. Make that grind more enjoyable. In the end no1 would want auto repeat if they added more content that isnt quite autoable right? And thats only good for the game, right?

I probably got into it too much. U can only imagime how much i was thinking while grinding at 5 AM almost every single day. Hell i was so addicted that i had everything planned around e7. Every day at 11AM ( thats when server reset was for me ) i made sure i had no plans. Id wake up 10 30 w8 for 20 mins, smoke and jump into it grind for an hour and a half finish most dailies. So as u can see they just need to add more weekly/monthly reseta to the game. Make it feel fresh. While every1 loved this colab i knew it would be better to focus om actual gameplay rather then 1 speical event. Bc now that it ended we are back to square one. Hopefully seaaon 2 adds somethimg. I might even come back to europe server if i see some good change. I anyway im always glad to see players go ""against"" the game, BUT with constructive criticizm not childish yelling.

But people like meat, and they are going to support the corporations that can give them the best meat as quickly and as cheaply as possible. I think you really have this backwards.

No, they say they serve individuals, corporations and governments serve themselves, if animal agriculture was simply banned or at least severely reduced meat consumption would inevitably fall and the problems of intensive animal agriculture would be greatly reduced or perhaps would disappear entirely. Corporations act in the interests of making profits, though animal agriculture is extremely environmentally destructive it is also profitable, therefore it will be done, and the government corporations write checks to accept whatever the long-term consequences may be. Consumer desires do not have to be met, nor should they be at all times. 

Like I said, you are entrenched in liberal ideology, you accept what the ruling class tells you about this world as fact, hence why you seemingly cannot comprehend what I‚Äôm trying to tell you.

&gt;Yes, yes it is. We want more and we want to live more comfortably, and the only reason we didn't do it in the past is because we didn't have the technology, and the only reason we have the technology is because it's human nature.

Do you know why accumulation began? It was mainly to have a surplus at all times to continue harvests, it wasn‚Äôt because ‚Äúpeople want things‚Äù it was because people want to not die. And even then, again, are consumer desires worth destroying the world? Why do you keep dancing around this point? You seem to believe an excess of worthless commodities is necessary and I do not know why. The Earth is necessary, food and water are necessary, housing and healthcare are necessary, 700 types of Barbie dolls are not.

&gt;The system is comprised of individuals and it caters to individuals. If it doesn't then individuals will band together and replace it with something that does.

Ah, I see, so you will simply declare liberal ideology is dogmatic fact, got it. Societies should not be analyzed as societies, but as collections of individuals, and we should cater to individuals while ignoring societal issues, and we should never consider how and why this ideology arose. I see you aren‚Äôt interested in questioning your beliefs in any way.

&gt;Clearly that alternative form of existing was not as appealing as what was being enjoyed in the West, so the people rejected it, which is pretty much my point.

You do realize the vast majority of people in Russia and the constituents republics voted to keep socialism and the USSR and were only seeking political liberalization? You do realize the majority in Russia right now want a return of the USSR and those that actually lived during it say times were much better? Did you know the collapse of the USSR led to the greatest fall in living standards in modern history? With mass privatization the economy of Russia halved within a few days, leaving the region in chaos and poverty, even now poverty, unemployment, and drug addiction are severe problems in Russia and Eastern Europe.

Anyway, I‚Äôm bored now, I remember that old Mark Fisher phrase, ‚ÄúIt is easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism‚Äù.

You're absolutely correct that there are many people who think like Cleese, and while I am a fan of his work as an actor  I, (and no one else should) be afraid to point out that his views are racist. Now let's be clear, I'm not saying John is filled with rage everytime he sees a brown person. I'm saying his definition of english is absolutely based on how people look. If John encountered a white person with russian and german parents who spoke with a perfect English accent he would consider them English before asking who their parents were. Maajid would be considered not-english purely based on how he looks despite having the same birthright to England along with same perfect English accent.

So I absolutely agree we cannot ignore the fact that a lot of people think like this, but the answer certainly isn't to tell a born and bred person of the English country that he should have to identify differently to his peers who share everything but skin colour.


&gt;Yes, I agree that identities are layered in exactly this way. But those identities aren‚Äôt just factual descriptions, they‚Äôre senses of self. I know plenty of English people who don‚Äôt think of themselves as European; there‚Äôs a big overlap in this group with those who wouldn‚Äôt consider Nawaz English. You and I might disagree with that perspective, but it‚Äôs part of the national conversation.

Well this would even further play into my point that self identity is even more important. Maajid does consider himself English, and by every observable metric he is. There are people who don't feel that way based on nebulous physical perceptions but this does not override an demonstrable reality. Some people still think that women can't 'truly' be boxers or MMA fighters but by definition they are so that categorization takes priority.

&gt;Hispanic isn‚Äôt an ethnicity

The word 'Hispanic' is indeed an [Ethnonym.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnonym) 


&gt;I don‚Äôt think ethnicity is solely a question of where you were born and what your first language was

Again with the above example of hispanic or even something like Arab proves that ethnicity can encompass a lot of things or a few things. There is no hard an fast rule and the definition seems to vary from person to person. I would make the argument that Maajid and any other non white English people can be English without having to fit the entire countries nebulous definition of 'ethnically English'.

&gt;It might not turn out to be better, obviously.

They absolutely do, because the patterns of population growth are conforming exactly to what we expect in the [demographic transition model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition). 

[I wrote a longer comment here explaining why this fear of overpopulation is wrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/bw2k0g/twice_as_many_fishing_vessels_are_chasing_fewer/epw1mhb/), but here's the cliff notes version:

There's only ever one big population boom when a country first industrialises, which is always followed by sharply dropping birth rates. Most of Asia has undergone this process and the continent has hit the maximum amount of population that it will probably ever have, just as Europe did 100 years prior to Asia. Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia are currently industrialising, and so they will experience one population boom, then a sharp decline as expected. The world is nearing it's natural maximum human population.

&gt; Bon Iver is a Grammy Award winning  folk band from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, United States, and one of Justin Vernon's current and most notable music projects to date. The band also consists of Mike Noyce, Sean Carey and Matt MacCaughan. 

&gt; The name 'Bon Iver' (pronounced ""bon ee-VAIR"") is a play on the French phrase 'bon hiver' meaning 'good winter'. Vernon independently released Bon Iver's debut album For Emma, Forever Ago in 2007, most of which was recorded during a four-month stay in a remote cabin in Wisconsin.

&gt; While in high school and college Vernon founded the indie-rock bands Mount Vernon and DeYarmond Edison in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, where he still resides.

&gt; According to the For Emma Songfacts, after the break-up of De Yarmond Edison, Vernon retreated to his father's log cabin, out in the woods of north-east Wisconsin to hibernate for three snowy months. There he collected his thoughts and formulated them into a suite of songs,  For Emma, Forever Ago . The album was originally self-released in late 2007 in a run of 500 copies and sold out instantly. 

&gt; The album garnered critical acclaim, and was picked up by the indie-rock label Jagjaguwar, which gave the album a proper release on February 19th, 2008. The album was released in the UK and Europe by iconic indie 4AD on May 12, 2008.

&gt; When released in the UK, For Emma, Forever Ago received 5/5 and ""Album of the Month"" reviews in both MOJO and Uncut magazines. It is currently the third highest rated album of 2008 on review-aggregator site Metacritic, with accolades from publications including The Village Voice, The Hartford Courant and The A.V. Club.

&gt; The group's second album Bon Iver, Bon Iver was released on June 17, 2011 to universal acclaim. It was named by Pitchfork Media as the best album of 2011 on their annual list. At the 2012 Grammys, the album won Best Alternative Album and the group was awarded Best New Artist, despite having debuted in 2007.

As a european and lots of other europeans could tell you, we knew what the next couple of years between EU and america were going to be like the minute Trump got elected. It would be bad. I will not lie that he turned out worse than even i could imagine.

Of course, with the state of disarray of american politics, i can see what you are getting at when it comes to opportunity for the EU. However, i also think that now is the time to disentangle with the US as it is far to unpredictable.

     Irlane deu entrada na pens√£o para a m√£e, que perdeu o marido em setembro, mas aguarda h√° oito meses   Desde que o pai morreu, no final de setembro, a professora Irlane Val√©ria Oliveira teve de adaptar toda sua vida para garantir os cuidados necess√°rios para sua m√£e, portadora de Alzheimer. Mudou para uma casa maior, com aluguel mais caro, contratou uma cuidadora em tempo parcial, e passou a gastar R$ 500,00/m√™s com fraldas geri√°tricas, sem contar alimenta√ß√£o, transporte e outras demandas de dona Elza.

 O pai de Irlane era aposentado e ela n√£o demorou a procurar o INSS (Instituto Nacional do Seguro Social) para solicitar a pens√£o por morte tendo sua m√£e como benefici√°ria, mas desde o dia 5 de outubro que ela espera um retorno. O √≥rg√£o afirma que o prazo legal para resposta seria de 30 dias, prorrog√°veis por mais 30, segundo previsto na Lei 9.784/99, mas admite que o prazo m√©dio para Salvador e regi√£o √© de 150 dias. No caso de Irlane e dona Elza, a espera j√° ultrapassa 240 dias.

  "" At√© j√° prestei queixa na ouvidoria, mas n√£o t√™m previs√£o

 *  ""Eu ligo sempre no 135 mas s√≥ me dizem que est√° em an√°lise, n√£o tem previs√£o, mas quando sair ser√° retroativo. At√© j√° prestei queixa na ouvidoria, mas a √∫nica informa√ß√£o a mais foi de que os processos ficam em fila √∫nica, sem lista de prioridade"", conta Irlane. Ela diz que cogitou buscar a Justi√ßa, mas pensou que demoraria ainda mais, ent√£o permanece esperando.

 **An√°lise**

 O indesej√°vel ""em an√°lise"" tamb√©m √© sempre mostrado para a administradora Walkiria Soledade, 59 anos, quando consulta o aplicativo Meu INSS para acompanhar sua aposentadoria por tempo de contribui√ß√£o. Mais de 190 dias se passaram desde que solicitou seu benef√≠cio. Na esperan√ßa de obter uma resposta diferente, ela agendou um atendimento presencial, mas apenas ouviu mais um vez que o processo est√° sendo analisado.

 O coordenador da Central de An√°lise da Ger√™ncia Executiva do INSS em Salvador, Leandro dos Campos Alves, ressalta que a m√©dia de 150 dias n√£o significa a inexist√™ncia de processos mais demorados. ""Temos concess√µes autom√°ticas, nas quais a pessoa d√° entrada e o benef√≠cio sai no mesmo dia, ent√£o nesses casos o prazo que vai ser usado na m√©dia √© de um dia"", detalha. Alves afirma que o per√≠odo atual est√° sendo dedicado exatamente aos processos de outubro e novembro.

  150

 √© o prazo m√©dio informado pelo INSS para Salvador e regi√£o, no √¢mbito estadual, a m√©dia pra concess√£o √© de 80 dias

  De acordo com o coordenador, cerca de 50 mil requerimentos est√£o em espera na regi√£o de abrang√™ncia de Salvador, que soma a capital baiana e os munic√≠pios de Cama√ßari, Santo Amaro, Alagoinhas, Esplanada, Lauro de Freitas, Catu, Dias D'√Åvila, Mata de S√£o Jo√£o, Pojuca, S√£o Sebasti√£o do Pass√©, Sim√µes Filho e Olindina.

 Para todo o estado, a soma dos tr√™s benef√≠cios mais demandados pela popula√ß√£o chega a 100 mil pedidos em aberto. Alves explica que no √¢mbito estadual, o tempo m√©dio de concess√£o √© de 80 dias e que os l√≠deres em n√∫mero de requerimentos s√£o as aposentadorias, especialmente por tempo de contribui√ß√£o, pens√µes e os benef√≠cios assistenciais.

 **Online**

 Embora Walk√≠ria tenha ido a uma ag√™ncia dar entrada na sua aposentadoria, Alves informa que os pedidos de aposentadoria urbana (por idade ou por tempo de contribui√ß√£o) e os sal√°rios-maternidade urbanos podem ser requeridos na internet, sem que o usu√°rio sequer precise comparecer a uma ag√™ncia.

Perhaps a few continental banks moved since the EU formed, but why would the banking capital of the world move because of Brexit? Especially since the UK would be free to change domestic policy to make it profitable to stay whereas the EU has dozens

The EU wasnt formed in the 1600s. The EU came after World War 2. London was the banking capital of the world because it had access to many markets through its colonies. Banks remained in London after decolonization because the UK, through the commonwealth, still had strong international market access. As the world became more globalized and londons unique access to matkets became less unique because many nations have similar access, banks remained because of the UKS access to europe. Now that is gone they are leaving. What changes specifically do you think the UK can make that they cant now because of the EU?

&gt;econdly, Germany is a terrible place to move. Its economy is about to gobsmacked by US tariffs on their autos and be sent into a recession. Their growth rates are already bad without the tariffs and their government is the definition of unstable with no one know who's going to be in power 10 years from now. Far right? Far left? The center is all but evaporating. 

All of this is wrong, the same coalition that ruled Germany the last 10 years rule it now, while there has been a surge of far right support in the form of the AFD, they are nowhere near taking power. US tarrifs will hurt Germany certainly though last I checked Trump had called them off. Their main market is the EU, the most valuable market in the world. Thats where they make their bread and butter. I am surprised Trump supporters dont look at Germany as a model, despite being a wealthy nation they actually protected their manufacturing jobs, unlike the United States.

&gt;They don't need to lower taxes, they have an extra nine billion to play with every year to play with after leaving the EU and they can jettison all useless EU regulations to give them the competitive edge. Add in the ability to make their own trade deals, they have several vectors to be a thorn in the EU's side if the EU chooses to treat the UK as an adversary

This is misleading. 9 billion out of the UK but much more comes in through increased trade and higher business profits. Not all of the benefits of the EU go directly to the government where all the payments do. You are comparing how much the UK government gets from the EU vrs how much it spends, you need to take into account how much more money British citizens make through profiting on increased trade.

La catalana m√°s internacional del momento ofreci√≥ una rueda de prensa en la que muchos periodistas se han quedado fuera de la sala porque todos los medios de comunicaci√≥n nacionales e internacionales presentes en el festival quer√≠an estar en la primera rueda de prensa de su gira europea, que ma√±ana -1 de junio- empieza en Barcelona.Rosal√≠a, quien apareci√≥ con enormes plataformas y trabajad√≠simas u√±as, como es habitual en ella, salud√≥ uno por uno a los periodistas que tomaron la palabra, ya que a la mayor√≠a los conoc√≠a de las primeras entrevistas, cuando todav√≠a no era conocida.Cuando uno de ellos le pregunt√≥ c√≥mo se ve Barcelona desde las alturas, ahora que es una ""reina de la m√∫sica"", la cantante contest√≥: ""Yo nunca me he ido, voy y vuelvo, ahora he estado fuera, de gira, pero aqu√≠ est√° mi centro, mi familia"".Su centro quiz√°s est√© en Barcelona, pero su m√∫sica est√° en el mundo entero y el v√≠deo de su √∫ltima canci√≥n Aute Cuture, que se lanz√≥ ayer jueves, se hizo viral en cuesti√≥n de minutos.
""Es una canci√≥n que empezamos a hacer en 2017 y que ahora hemos publicado, sin prisa. Es un ejemplo de que mi posici√≥n en la industria no ha hecho cambiar mi sonido ni mi forma de trabajar"", apunt√≥ la artista.Sobre esta canci√≥n a√±adi√≥ que las u√±as excesivas que luce ""son un s√≠mbolo de feminidad"" que le gusta porque ""son est√©ticas, pero tambi√©n pueden ser un arma"" y reflejan ""la fuerza femenina"".Tambi√©n se√±al√≥ que la nueva canci√≥n ""tiene que ver con la celebraci√≥n, la fantas√≠a y el humor"", algo que le apetec√≠a especialmente ahora, despu√©s de 'El Mal Querer', un disco con un trasfondo duro.Estas palabras han hecho pensar a los presentes que su pr√≥ximo √°lbum quiz√°s sea m√°s festivo, pero ella aclar√≥ que de momento simplemente ha entrado en el estudio ""para disfrutar de la m√∫sica"", pero todav√≠a no sabe hacia d√≥nde ir√°n las ideas que tiene.No es de extra√±ar que le cueste concentrarse en un nuevo disco porque el √∫ltimo a√±o de Rosal√≠a ha sido de infarto: ""Han pasado tantas cosas que ni me lo creo -reconoci√≥-. He trabajado mucho y no he tenido fines de semanas, pero a veces las cosas son as√≠ y me gusta mi trabajo, me lo paso muy bien"".Todo este trabajo dio sus frutos: ahora es un referente que muchas adolescentes imitan, algo de lo que Rosal√≠a es consciente, pero hasta cierto punto.""Ser demasiado consciente puede ser un peso excesivo. Quiero estar conectada con mi entorno y aportar, pero muchos artistas han aportado de manera casi inconsciente, siendo simplemente ellos mismos"", reflexion√≥.En este sentido, Rosal√≠a subray√≥ que se esfuerza por ser fiel a s√≠ misma y ""cuidar todos los detalles"", porque la m√∫sica es ""el centro"" de su vida.""Todo lo que me apasiona lo vuelco en mi trabajo, tambi√©n el cine"", dice la cantante.¬†A este respecto, reconoci√≥ que en el v√≠deo de su √∫ltima canci√≥n hay referencias a Tarantino y se mostr√≥ muy orgullosa de haber podido trabajar con Almod√≥var en su √∫ltima pel√≠cula.

Of course, but to know if it has no bearing we first need to know if there is a possibility of Hg emmission, right? And then to see if models indicate a minute or large amount of emmission.

Current studies on amalgams seem to be large, broad, and muddled by so many variables it's impossible to dissect information. Countries in Europe ban the fillings, while here in the UK we say they're safe, this lack of consensus is clearly caused by an insufficiency in the studies themselves. 

In health we're not always interested in broad strokes, doing X activity doubles your chance of mortality, for instance. What people make decisions on are incremental changes, phasing out certain items in a diet, living in a less polluted street, and so on. By themselves statistically these single changes are hard to detect in large scale studies, due to the number of variables, but cumulatively they're significant.

As such I'm interested in determining it there is an emission of Hg, and then how much. It's entirely possible this is harmful, and entirely possible it isn't.

The reason people generally say 4 is because A) all remaining players are tryharders sunsabitches and B) its the number you use in order to rotate Hard Dungeon Carries.

The basic things alt gets by doing weekly stuff is both money and gem dust, both by HD. Maybe some good accesories you sell on the market.

Now, back to why have alts and how they get you to endgame faster

Lets take Gems, for instance. You can get gem dust from three places - HD (hard dundgeons), at1.8k a week, Stellar Glass NPC, at 1k per account and guilds, at....800? Something like that. Now, lets just take the HD ones, for this example.

Each character can make up 1.8k dust per 30 runs. That roughly gives you a +7 gem set per week (9 gems at +7). But the thing is, the cost from 1-7 is smaller then 8-10. Which means next week you'll upgrade about 5 gems to +8 only. Now from those +8, in the third week only 3 of them you'll be able to upgrade from 8 to 9, and after that, on the fourth week, youll get 2 +10 and another +9. 

Now, obviously the best way to go around enchanting is spreading resources so you get everything to +8, then 9, etc, but thats not the point of the example.

If you have a single alt, you literally DOUBLE the ammount of gem dust collected from hard dungeons, Meaning by the end of week 4, you'll have 4 +10 and 2 +9. Add another flat ammount on the third alt, and if you have four (hence, for many reasons, the magic number), you get a whole +10 set per month (from HD alone mind you, it takes a bit less if you get the other options too).

OR, you take 4 months to get to a full T10 set if you only have 1 character. 3 months with 2, 2 with 3, 1 with 4. You raise your grind level to match what progression speed you want. 

&amp;#x200B;

All alts are, are progression engines. They both reduce time in mid-game and generate a recurrent income method (by HD running).

Every 3-4 runs, you receive a hard dungeon clear box. Said box constains valuable resources and more importantly in the case of alts, dem money. all boxes combined give you a little over 4kk per week.

1 character means 4kk. 2 means 8, 3-12, 4-16. Money is generally (right now) converted into either A)buying accessories (in your case. Again, only buy lv.50 epic ones.) or B) Buying crystal fragments, which are enhancement requirements. BOY do you need these for legendary gear and enhancing in general. For epic gear purposes, you don't really need an alt, since once you get to the point weekly rewards aren't enough, you'll just do raids instead.

&amp;#x200B;

As for HD runnning, there are 3 trains of though. 

&amp;#x200B;

1)HD sell runs - Over the NA and EU servers, its common to outright BUY runs from people - you stand at the entrance and wait for them to kill bosses that give you loot in form of both resources and gem dust - at the cost of ALL the money you get from those HD, generally, IIRC. Its not really a bad deal, really. Saves you time and generate resources (most people that do this are well overgeared, so runs are quite quick). Once you get a +10 set, you're good to stop. Now, over here in the SA server people don't buy this (we're cheap MOFOS and tryharders by nature), so we all default to the following 2 options.

2)Player rotations - 1 main carries 3 alts in the hard dungeons, then swaps with each other, for a total of 60 runs in nowadays generally about 50-60min total with good geared people.

3)Low level dundgeon running - Some low level dungeons have a low clear time, like the two i said on the other answer. The thing is, you don't get dust from these dungeons, but for people like me, thats not really an issue anymore. I don't need the gem dust, i have enough stacked for future contets, but money is something i always need. The lack of onyx and Chaos onyx won't really matter in the long run for me personally, but i digress.

Yeah, leveling is boring. At least its quick.

and even so, those Israelites who remained at palestine already converted to Christianity after Jesus Christ and the Byzantine conversion to Christianity, along with the other natives of the land who predated them, and after the arab conquest a big portion of them converted to Islam.

Those Christians and Muslims are now what are reffered to as Palestinian Arabs, and that includes the people of Ancient Israel who converted to one or both of these religions.

hence:
-There were natives in Palestine before Israelities, or even before Abraham, those natives are our ancestors, then we Arabs are the natives, not european Jews

-Israelites were the first colonizers under Joshua

-Israelites got assimiliated within the natives due to many historical conditions including conversion to Christianity and Islam, so the descendant of real Israelites are already a portion of Palestinian arabs.

-Jewish Disapora claims that they belong to the land after abandoning it for God knows how many thousand years , living in other places and adopting other cultures, (regardless that most of them are actually descendants of Khazars) , makes them now natives of the places they're living it, the Polish Jew is a native of Poland, the German Jew is a native of Germany, the Russian Jew is a native of Russia, etc.

-Even if you claim ancestry and relinquish your current nationality, it is not our problem (we the real natives, palestinian arabs) that you have an identity crisis and you want to solve it by colonizing our land and driving us out and claiming it is a Jewish state.

-It's really pathetic that you call yourself a native american, a victim of european colonization, supports european colonization of another place.

First, as we know from Shehyns story the Ademre come from a nomadic group who we apparently had many enemies and needed to protect themselves often. This let to Aethe and Rethe's duel and from there the 99 tales and eventually the Lethani.

The origin of the Lethani is still part of it during the time that Kvothe meets the Ademre and learns of the Lethani. This explains part of the violence within the Ademre and why they see weaker people and less combat prone as below them.

Secondly, there are different schools and we only learn of two of them, the path of the sword and the path of joy. Apparently, the path of the sword is a more conservative and strict school if we believe Kvothe's, sparring partner. Therefore, it is quite possible that there are interpretations of the Lethani which are more peaceful and less denouncing of outsiders.

Thirdly, we learn the Lethani through the story of Kvothe, who tries to understand the Lethani while placing a lot of value in the strict academic way of thinking. So there might be many translation issues with certain concepts, like for example, the difference in punctuality between North-western European countries and Latin-American countries (this might be an oversimplification and generalisation but I hope it highlights the point I try to make). The fact that the  Ademre have a completely different idea about fatherhood is also a good example.  
I think that the second and third point combined we see in the difference between many western philosophies, who are constantly looking for ultimate truth and for example the Judaic philosophies where there is no ultimate truth but many different explanations co-existing.  


And as a final note, we must remember that Kote is a storyteller pur sang, and he has a goal with this Ademre story. He could have skipped it like he skipped the Trial but he willingly goes into depth about everything he experiences there, which also reflect on who he becomes. You could ask yourself, why does Kote highlight the violence and the fact that all foreigners are savages. Why doesn't he go into depth with Vasthe about different explanations of the Lethani? And I think there are many more questions to be asked, or different points of view to explore to understand the Lethani.
